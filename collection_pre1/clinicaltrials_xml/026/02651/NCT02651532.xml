	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) one common gastrointestinal disorder . It prevalence general population 5-20 % common woman young adult . Despite one frequent reason consultation many patient undiagnosed . There reliable biomarkers . The diagnosis clinical , base Rome III criterion . IBS characterize chronic recurrent abdominal pain associate change bowel frequency consistency , etiology exclude . The combination Rome III criterion absence alarm symptom sensitivity 65 % , specificity 100 % , 100 % positive predictive value negative predictive value 76 % . Current test commonly fail obtain objective diagnosis , effective therapy lack . There specific endoscopic finding discriminate IBS patient healthy patient . Most colonoscopy perform rule etiology 50 % case normal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Confocal Endomicroscopy Utility ( p-CLE ) Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pathophysiology complex , multifactorial completely know . Impaired intestinal barrier function mucosal inflammation small large intestine report . Evidence inflammation neuronal degeneration myenteric plexus find full-thickness intestinal biopsy sample IBS patient . It find IBS patient significantly high density intestinal epithelial gap . The elevated epithelial gap intestine IBS patient , surrogate marker increase epithelial cell extrusion , may cause alter intestinal permeability observe may lead mucosal inflammation . Confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) new endoscopic image tool enable visualization change gut mucosa . The use intravenous fluorescein enable high-resolution real-time imaging vivo micron scale , allow visualization cellular detail ongoing endoscopy . This technology use identify quantify epithelial gap sign inflammation . The purpose study evaluate presence microscopic inflammation previously demonstrate patient IBS , use pCLE . The determination exact area inflammation allow direct biopsy accurate way . This type systematic may allow future classify patient symptomatically ( constipation , diarrhea mixed predominant IBS ) also accord degree inflammation . There Gold Standard test patient assess response treatment . The possibility use pCLE identify area microscopic inflammation allows degree inflammation use monitoring parameter . Probably CLE use assess response treatment different type treatment , determine difference subtypes patient IBS , evaluate remission , recurrence prognosis . Also may clarify potential mechanism pathogenesis endoscopic criterion diagnosis disease . The present study first evaluate colon microscopic inflammation use pCLE IBS patient . Study design : This observational analytical cross-section , population - base survey study , prospective case collection , non-randomized simple blind , perform Tertiary Academic Center . Setting : Ecuadorian Institute Digestive Diseases ( IECED ) , OmniHospital Academic Tertiary Center . We include patient October 2015 March 2016 . Patients recruit gastroenterology unit ( IECED ) . The study protocol consent form approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) conduct accord declaration Helsinki . Patients sign inform consent answer questionnaire include constitutional data ( sex , age , comorbid medical condition , medication ) . Patients IBS group classify accord symptom diarrhea predominant ( IBS-D ) , constipation predominant ( IBS-C ) mix type ( IBS-M ) . Endoscopic finding record database . Endoscopic technique : All colonoscopy perform patient undergone standard bowel preparation use either polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution . Initially routine white light colonoscopy perform IBS healthy control patient , use Pentax scope ( Pentax EC-387CILK , Tokyo , Japan ) great care damage epithelium . The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale inflammation change record . During withdrawal , part colon evaluate ( cecum , right-side colon , transverse , left-side colon , sigmoid rectum ) use pCLE randomly one point segment , sign iatrogenic mucosal damage . Careful wash mucosa water order prevent inclusion image artefacts residual stool fragment . Before initiate CLE evaluation , intravenous injection 5 ml 10 % fluorescein do . Fluorescein stain vessel give good tissue structure , nuclei stain appear dark spot . Optimal contrast obtain within first 10min injection , good quality image acquire 30-60 min . Currently Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy ( CLE ) perform use CLE probe ( pCLE ) . The confocal microscope use pCLE capture microscopic image untreated vivo tissue . The microscope use focus laser light define wavelength pass confocal aperture . Images reconstruct two dimension . For pCLE ( Cellvizio Mauna Kea Technologies , Paris , France ) , laser scan unit light source outside body . The laser beam transport via flexible confocal miniprobes distal lens sequentially scan bundle 10000 optical fiber . Confocal miniprobes flexible , diameter range 0.9 mm 2.5 mm . In study pCLE ColoFlex probe use ( Cellvizio ; Mauna Kea Technology , Paris , France ) . The probe go accessory channel conventional endoscope . The image rate 0.08 s/frame 1024×1024 pixel image depth 20 μm . The confocal image first analyze endoscopy . Then , image digitally store reviewed procedure order zoom detail high magnification ( approximately 10000 fold ) , special design software package ( Cellvizio Viewer ) , allow image correction stabilization . Immediately pCLE evaluation , proceed next colon segment , target biopsy take mucosal area evaluate . Bleeding impair image quality , therefore probe place gently contact tissue order avoid trauma pCLE image complete region mucosa biopsy . The endoscopist perform pCLE blind status patient image later analyze detail blindly two different person two year ' experience endomicroscopy . There study validate classification colon inflammation use CLE IBS patient . Inflammation colon mucosa ulcerative colitis ( UC ) describe previously use CLE . Kiesslich et al . report 3-grade classification inflammation activity CLE , combine crypt architecture , cellular infiltration , vessel architecture . Nevertheless assessment cellular infiltration question difficulty differentiate cell type CLE . Chang-Qing Li , et al . use three CLE parameter evaluate inflammation UC patient : 4-grade crypt-architecture classification , fluorescein leakage , microvascular alteration . On hand , Miami classification pCLE defines colitis use : crypt fusion distortion , bright epithelium , dilate prominent branching vessels.In present study parameter use CLE inflammation : 1.Epithelial gap follow leaks secretion fluorescein lumen . In CLE image normal colonic mucosa , lumen crypt free fluorescein appear dark center crypt ; however , inflame mucosa , fluorescein leak crypt lumen ; therefore , lumen brighter surround epithelium . 2.4-grade crypt-architecture classification : Types A B consider normal chronic inflammation , respectively , type C D indicate acute inflammation . Type A : Regular arrangement size crypt . Type B : Irregular arrangement crypt , enlarge space crypt . Type C : Dilation crypt opening , irregular arrangement crypt , enlarge space crypt compare type B . Type D : Crypt destruction / crypt abscess . 3.Dilated prominent branching vessel Interobserver Intraobserver Agreement : A data set contain CLE photograph video colon segment present three blinded endoscopists , confirm finding . Inter- intra-observer reproducibility measure base comparison still image video three investigator . To evaluate intra-observer agreement investigator ass image two time answer compare . To evaluate inter-observer agreement answer three investigator compare . In general , learn curve CLE short inter intra-observer agreement good . Statistical analysis : Baseline characteristic compare case control group use Chi-square Fisher Test categorical variable , continue variable , use Mann-Whitney Test . Diagnosis efficacy measure thought sensitive , specificity accuracy . All statistical analysis perform use SPSS software suite v.22 .</detailed_description>
