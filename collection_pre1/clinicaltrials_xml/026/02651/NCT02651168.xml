	<brief_summary>Diabetic macular edema refers swell ( fluid accumulation ) center retina . The retina like film camera locate back eye . This condition develop diabetic swell result leak fluid blood vessel eye , center retina , macula . If leave untreated , affect central . The current standard treatment diabetic macular edema include medication inject directly eye ( intravitreal injection ) laser eye treatment . The drug inject directly eye know anti-VEGF agent help reduce leak . This include bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) ranibizumab ( Lucentis® ) . However , patient respond well anti-VEGF treatment give option switch another new anti-VEGF medication , call aflibercept ( Eylea® ) approve treat DME . A recent large study demonstrate aflibercept efficacious anti-VEGF therapy list even superior patient bad vision ( Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network , Wells JA , Glassman AR , et al . Aflibercept , Bevacizumab , Ranibizumab Diabetic Macular Edema . N Engl J Med . 2015:150218140025008-150218140025008 ) . The purpose study determine factor affect treatment response aflibercept ( amount swell reduction ) patient diabetic macular edema , previously unresponsive ranibizumab injection .</brief_summary>
