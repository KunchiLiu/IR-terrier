	<brief_summary>The objective pilot study perform set pressure flow rate measurement order quantitatively characterize safe irrigation `` flushing '' ventricular shunt catheter , routine maneuver perform neurosurgeon shunt revision surgery . This maneuver involve inject saline syringe clear plug shunt catheter . Based data obtain Stage I study , device fabricate provide small-volume pulse fluid use surgeon . In Stage II study , pressure flow rate measurement generate specialized flusher device collect measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To collect pressure flow rate measurement shunt revision surgery human patient . Pressure recording inject fluid obtain use disposable off-the-shelf sterile pressure transducer ( typically use intracranial arterial pressure monitor ) readily available operating room . First , surgeon attempt flush catheter use Alcyone in-line Flusher device . If fails , surgeon may elect attempt flush use standard syringe attach catheter . The flow rate measure video , record syringe flush maneuver , extract plunger motion information apply image processing acquire video . In event record equipment available ( operation usually unscheduled sometimes urgent ) , irrigation technique may use without pressure recording . Secondary Objective : To analyze collect data establish maximal allowable injection pressure flow rate . The collect data segment patient analyze maximal value pressure saline injection rate record spreadsheet . Inter-patient variation result , presumably due different degree occlusion , statistically evaluate . We also determine catheter appear occlude operating room resume flow flush maneuver .</detailed_description>
