	<detailed_description>Summary : Objectives : The primary aim study define effect teriflunomide ( Aubagio® ) cognitive ability patient relapse multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . There two secondary objective , [ ] relate change cognition vocational problem , [ b ] determine MRI correlate change cognition , specifically gray-matter ( GM ) volume metric investigator believe reflect neurodegeneration . Design : This prospective , observational , single-blinded , longitudinal study teriflunomide effect cognitive performance MS patient 24 month . Neuropsychological status 3T MRI assess baseline , 12 month 24 month . Vocational status assess every three month via internet . Statistical analysis emphasize within-subjects change metric maximize statistical power . Study Population : Thirty ( 30 ) relapse MS patient 30 healthy control ( HC ) enrol study . Outcomes : An information process speed index memory composite index calculate conventional , validated neuropsychological test recommend consensus opinion publication . Conventional clinical metric overall neurological disability also assess . Vocational performance monitor use newly develop online survey call Multiple Sclerosis Vocational Monitoring Survey ( MSVMS ) . Regional GM atrophy , define measurement thalamic cortical atrophy , serve neurodegeneration outcome . Significance research : The effect teriflunomide development cognitive impairment vocational capacity unknown . This study elucidate effect teriflunomide important outcome .</detailed_description>
