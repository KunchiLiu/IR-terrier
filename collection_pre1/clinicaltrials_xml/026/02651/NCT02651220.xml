	<detailed_description>Up 1000 patient 12 40 year age inclusive enrol 870 patient modify intent-to-treat ( mITT ) population 579 patient per-protocol ( PP ) population . The primary inclusion criterion presence ≥ 20 inflammatory lesion ( papule pustule ) ≥ 25 non-inflammatory lesion ( open close comedo ) ≤ 2 nodulocystic lesion ( i.e. , nodule cyst ) face Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA ) score 3 4 . Eligible patient randomize 1:1:1 ratio one three treatment ( Test , Reference Placebo ) Visit 1 . Patients instruct apply first treatment even enrollment study continue apply daily next 83 day ( total 84 day ) . Patients attend follow schedule clinic visit : - Visit 1 - Screening/Baseline : Day 1 - Visit 2 - Interim Visit : Day 28 ± 4 - Visit 3 - Interim Visit : Day 56 ± 4 - Visit 4 - End Study : Day 85 ± 4 Efficacy evaluation base dermatological assessment clinic . The primary statistical analysis interest ( 1 ) percent change baseline Week 12 number inflame ( papules/pustules ) lesion non-inflamed ( open close comedo ) lesion . In addition , patient also evaluate Investigator determine `` Clinical Success '' `` Clinical Failure '' Week 12</detailed_description>
