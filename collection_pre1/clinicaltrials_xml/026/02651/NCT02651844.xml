	<brief_summary>- Seventy per cent breast cancer express estrogen ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PR ) respond endocrine treatment . - Actual therapy target ER . - There enough evidence progestin participate regulate breast cancer growth . - Antiprogestins block cell proliferation increase apoptosis breast cancer model express high level PRA . - Antiprogestins use treat breast cancer patient fail treatment ; benefit see select patient . - Mifepristone ( MFP ) currently use medical abortion treatment Cushing disease . - MFP might exert agonistic effect PRB isoform activate cAMP . This make mandatory evaluation PR isoform ratio breast cancer patient MFP therapeutic possibility . Main Goal To evaluate therapeutic dos MFP exert beneficial effect breast cancer express level PRA high PRB , evaluate inhibition proliferation marker and/or increase apoptotic marker . - Eligibility - Postmenopausal woman ( one year menses stop ) . - Women tumor show ratio PRA/PRB high 1.5 PR high 50 % . - Women without previous treatment . - All clinical stage tumor large 1.5 cm . - Patients without autoimmune disease and/or asthma . - Study design - Open Interventional . - Twenty woman take MFP ( 200 mg ) p.o . /day 14 day . As preliminary study , reach number investigator evaluate 80-100 patient . - Surgery perform 14 day treatment initiation , 24 h last dose . - PR isoform ratio evaluate western blot ( WB ) one core biopsy . Additional core use diagnosis , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) PR , Ki-67 marker . - At surgery sample freeze molecular study fix processed pathological evaluation . - Wilcoxon sign rank test use evaluate difference biomarker expression core biopsy surgical sample patient . - Blood collect treatment initiation prior final surgery . - Mammographic echographic study carry treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mifepristone Breast Cancer Patients With Higher Levels Progesterone Receptor Isoform A Than Isoform B .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis PR involve breast cancer growth . The antiprogestin mifepristone ( MFP ) exert antitumor effect mammary carcinomas high expression PRA . The investigator hypothesize breast cancer higher level PRA PRB benefit antiprogestin therapy . Precis The aim study select 20 breast cancer patient , primary tumor express PR ( 50 % high ) 1.5 fold PRA compare PRB , neoadjuvant treatment mifepristone ( MFP ) 14 day biopsy core surgery . There study present time select breast cancer patient accord prevail PR isoform express . This extremely important since antiprogestins might effect even stimulate over-expressing PRB . Background Breast cancer remain one main cause death woman . Current endocrine treatment aim target either estrogen receptor ( ER ) inhibit synthesis 17-β-estradiol ( E2 ) . Emerging evidence obtain experimental study , well human epidemiology , point important role progestin breast cancer growth . Both PR isoforms transcribe gene . PRB 933 amino acid PRA lack first 164 amino acid . They play different role vivo demonstrate use knock model . MFP , progesterone antagonist , may also act agonist presence PRB . In context , MFP-bound PR recruit coactivators rather corepressors . MFP may also exert antiglucocorticoid effect . As antiprogestin use different obstetric indication , uterine ripen intrauterine fetal death , dose high 200 mg/day . As antiglucocorticoid potential use different psychiatric disorder , include depression Alzheimer 's recently , FDA approve use treatment Cushing disease ( 300 mg daily ) . Antiprogestins breast cancer treatment The first clinical trial evaluate antiprogestin therapy patient recruit 22 patient third-line study . Patients treat MFP , 200 mg/day , 1-3 month . There 18 % response rate follow 3 month therapy . The long-term tolerance good . Three study review together unpublished result fifth study . There publish clinical result breast cancer treatment use MFP . More recently , four clinical trial recently launch evaluation antiprogestins . The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01138553 , test MFP neoadjuvancy discontinue difficulty recruit NCT00555919 , Schering , test lonaprisan , stop due lack expected clinical response . Two study way , NCT01800422 test telapristone NCT02052128 onapristone . Antiprogestins preclinical study Using murine mammary carcinoma express different PR isoforms , experimental human breast cancer model manipulate express different PR ratio , investigator demonstrate tumor level PRA high PRB regress antiprogestin treatment . Moreover , breast cancer sample high level PRA PRB respond ex vivo MFP treatment . Study design Registration : The investigator recruit patient mammographic echographic study ) diagnose breast cancer clinically ( confirm biopsy ) b ) surgery recommend treatment cancer . Patients interview Dr. Gass , /or Dr. Liguori , Dr. Paula Martínez-Vazquez , consent study . The original IC keep CRF patient copy main study file . Anonymization generation unique patient identifier : Research sample anonymized identification code . Only Dr. Gass Dr. Lanari access code . Biopsies : After sign IC evaluate patient potentially candidate clinical trial , patient biopsied echographic guide . Three needle core obtain ) make final diagnosis , b ) measure PRA/PRB isoform ratio western blot ( WB ) , c ) measure ER PR immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) store paraffin block biomarker staining , ) perform tumor transcriptome . Biopsy core flash frozen -80 °C molecular study others fix 10 % buffer formaldehyde diagnosis determination PR IHC follow routine hospital guideline . Blood : Will collect day biopsy ( 40 ml standard hospital procedure ) store make different study addition routine approach : ) MFP measure b ) purify circulate DNA/ microRNAs/tumor cell . This procedure repeat day surgery . Diagnosis : Seventy two hour biopsy , diagnosis , PR WB , IHC PR value available . If patient qualifies ready 14 day treatment . All study record CRF .
