	<brief_summary>HIV-1 infection characterize progressive depletion CD4+ T cell eventually lead clinically significant immunodeficiency . Severely immunosuppressed patient often experience increase risk opportunistic infection . A chronic generalize immune activation recognize main driving force T cell depletion , loss anti-HIV-1 immunity disease progression chronic HIV-1 infection . However , still unknown whether reduce immune activation restore CD4 T cell count lead restoration immunodeficiency chronic HIV infection.Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized donor peripheral-blood stem cell base HLA mismatch allogeneic transplantation demonstrate boost host immunity tumor , attenuate immune-mediated inflammation , promote hemopoiesis without acute graft-versus-host disease . Thus , may represent novel treatment adoptive therapy allogenic adoptive cell therapy ( AACT ) . Here , investigator propose hypothesis AACT therapy promote hemopoiesis bone marrow attenuate immune-mediated inflammation , subsequently lead restoration immunodeficiency HIV-infected patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although HIV-1 infection characterize progressive depletion CD4+ T cell eventually lead clinically significant immunodeficiency , chronic generalize immune activation recognize main driving force T cell depletion , loss anti-HIV-1 immunity disease progression chronic HIV-1 infection . In particular , immune activation identify disease determinant independent viral load cell death HIV-1 infection . A series clinical evidence indicate activated CD8 T cell may attack body cell infected virus . Because , CD4 cell infect HIV frequently destroy CD8 cell . Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) -mobilized donor peripheral-blood stem cell ( GPBSCs ) heterogeneous population immune cell potential role immunomodulation hemopoiesis . GPBSCs base HLA-mismatched allogeneic transplantation recently emerge promising candidate cell-based immunotherapy . Infusion GPBSCs demonstrate boost host immunity tumor promote hemopoiesis cohort patient acute myeloid leukemia . It represent novel treatment adoptive therapy allogenic adoptive cell therapy ( AACT ) several character : Before transplantation , donor recipient HLA-A , -B , -C , -DRB1 , -DQB1 locus type intermediate resolution polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer method . All ATAII-treated INR patient related donor HLA mismatch . Donors match HLA locus match red blood cell ( RBC ) type first choose . However , donor sex , age , characteristic consider priority.The donor subcutaneously inject 5Î¼g/kg G-CSF twice day 5 day peripheral mononuclear cell carry CS-3000S cell separator . Donor cell divide aliquot cryopreserved liquid nitrogen , freshly collect cell use first course . The purpose study investigate safety initial efficacy AACT treatment chronic HIV-1 infect patient severe immunodeficiency . 20 patient receive i.v . transfusion 2.0-3.0*10E8 cells/kg GPBSCs treat group 20 patient transfused placebo without GPBSCs control group . All 40 receive routine management AIDS . During 24- 48-week follow , evaluation safety efficacy undergone help establish innovative cell-based therapy treatment disease .</detailed_description>
