	<brief_title>Study Assessing Safety &amp; Effectiveness Catheter Lock Solution Dialysis Patients Prevent Bloodstream Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study demonstrate efficacy safety Neutrolin速 catheter lock solution ( CLS ) prevention catheter-related bloodstream infection ( CRBSI ) , incidence treatment-emergent adverse event subject receive hemodialysis ( HD ) treatment End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) compare heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL ( 1,000 USP Units/mL ) . This randomized , double-blind , active control , parallel-arm , multicenter study . Six hundred thirty two subject randomize 1:1 ratio receive either Neutrolin速 active control heparin ( Heparin sodium USP 1,000 units/mL , Benzyl alcohol 9.45 mg/mL Sodium chloride 9.0 mg/mL ) CLS . Approximately 632 randomized subject plan trial . In study , one-half subject ( 316 subject ) receive Neutrolin study drug half receive heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL ( 1,000 USP Units/mL ) benzyl alcohol preservative comparator . Subjects assign 1:1 ratio use permuted block without additional stratification group . The primary objective study demonstrate effectiveness Neutrolin速 CLS ESRD subject undergoing HD treatment use permanent , cuffed , tunnel silicone polyurethane HD catheter . The study evaluate whether Neutrolin速 superior active control heparin document time CRBSI consequently delay time occurrence CRBSI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject ESRD undergo chronic HD least two time per week 2 . Subject HD catheter demonstrate ability achieve minimum blood flow least 250 mL/min least two consecutive dialysis session blood flow enable successful HD 3 . The HD catheter implant tip jugular subclavian vein 4 . The subject expect expire within 180 day 5 . The subject likely require use CVC least 90 day 6 . The subject ( legal guardian ) understand nature study provide write informed consent prior study enrollment 7 . The subject willing comply specify followup evaluation prescribe dialysis therapy 8 . If female childbearing potential , subject must negative pregnancy test screen visit ( i.e. , subject pregnant ) ; lactate ; use acceptable method contraception , include abstinence , barrier method ( diaphragm condom ) , DepoProvera , hormonal contraceptive ( oral , implant , ring , patch ) duration study . ( NOTE : The subject must use choose method birth control least 1 month/cycle prior enrollment study ) . 1 . Subjects receive antibiotic within last 14 day 2 . Visible evidence compromise skin integrity present catheter exit site evidence catheter exit site infection 3 . Subject receive thrombolytic treatment ( i.e. , tPA ) current catheter within 30 day randomization 4 . Fill volume HD catheter unknown determine 5 . Subjects use type antimicrobialcoated heparincoated catheter 6 . Documented chronic bleeding diathesis , active recurrent bleeding within 1 month prior randomization 7 . Documented history atrial thrombus know hypercoagulable state 8 . Subjects open , nonhealing skin ulcer 9 . Current requirement systemic immunosuppression would increase risk infection 10 . Active malignancy require anticipate require chemotherapy likely cause leukopenia and/or immunosuppression 11 . Known allergy absolute contraindication citrate , taurolidine heparin history heparininduced thrombocytopenia 12 . Unstable malignancy 13 . Cirrhosis encephalopathy 14 . Subject currently take another medication know systemic drug interaction citrate , taurolidine , heparin 15 . Subject currently enrol another investigational device and/or drug trial participate another investigational device and/or drug trial within 30 day prior enrollment 16 . Subject anticipated receive renal transplant within 90 day ( subject transplant list , subject know anticipated transplant date within next 90 day exclude ) 17 . Any medical condition render subject unable unlikely complete study , would interfere optimal participation study produce significant risk subject .</criteria>
