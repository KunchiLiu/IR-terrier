	<brief_summary>The use compute tomography ( CT ) screening allow early detection lung cancer small 5mm diameter . Early stage cancer highly curable report survival great 90 % 5 year surgical resection . Before patient surgery , biopsy must perform . One common method transthoracic needle biopsy ( TTNB ) . In procedure , CT-image use locate area biopsy . Once identify , radiologist applies local anesthetic insert aspiration needle rib , lung tissue . The sampled lung tissue send pathology . Although procedure diagnostic yield range 70 % 85 % , associate serious complication pneumothorax , hemoptysis , infection , hemothorax , air embolism 20 % ( range 9 % -54 % ) incidence pneumothorax , air leak lung , require chest tube drainage . Additionally , 5-15 % case experience hemoptysis , cough blood , although significant life-threatening hemoptysis present le 1 % patient . When complication occur , hospitalization inpatient require , average length stay 1-3 day . A new form technology localize biopsy peripheral lung lesion believe significantly reduce amount complication occur biopsy . This technology know Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy ( ENB ) . ENB use electromagnetic track CT-generated virtual bronchoscopy create three-dimensional `` GPS map '' lung , guide surgeon directly tumor . The surgeon able perform bronchoscopy biopsy tumor inside bronchus . A recent systematic review meta-analysis 15 trial report pneumothorax rate 3.1 % , 1.6 % patient require chest tube drainage . Initial study demonstrate slightly low diagnostic yield ENB compare TTNB ; however , systematic exploration study heterogeneity reveal lung nodule include TTNB study large include meta-analysis ENB yield . The review identify six variable associate increase diagnostic yield ENB , include `` combine use ultrasonic radial probe catheter suction sample technique '' . The superDimension® InReach™ System grant Health Canada approval July 23 , 2009 . There study directly compare ENB TTNB , either retrospectively prospectively . Initial systematic review demonstrate ENB may slightly lower diagnostic yield relative TTNB . Selection bias low study quality may result underestimation true diagnostic yield associate ENB . The literature also confirm ENB significantly good safety profile compare TTNB . As , prospective comparison two technique mandate . This Phase II pilot feasibility trial utilize randomized methodology gather preliminary data require successful completion Phase III randomize control trial compare lung biopsy ENB verse TTNB . This study also first time ENB lung biopsy document Canada .</brief_summary>
