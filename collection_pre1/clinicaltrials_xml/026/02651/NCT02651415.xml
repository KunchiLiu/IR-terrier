	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect combination regorafenib perindopril hand-foot skin reaction ( HFSR ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) type side-effects compare publish incidence side-effects regorafenib alone . This research do attempt reduce side-effects associate regorafenib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Perindopril Regorafenib mCRC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize treatment regorafenib-treated mCRC patient perindopril may reduce HFSR compare report incidence severity . The investigator also hypothesize treatment regorafenib-treated mCRC patient perindopril likely reduce hypertension , know adverse effect VEGF/VEGFR inhibition . According 2014 Canadian Cancer Statistics , colorectal cancer second frequently diagnose cancer Canadian male third frequently diagnose cancer Canadian female , account 13.9 % 11.6 % new diagnosis , respectively . Although mortality rate decline slightly , colorectal cancer second frequent cause cancer death male third frequent cause cancer death female , 12.8 % 11.5 % respectively . Metastatic colorectal cancer generally curable . Median overall survival patient unresectable mCRC receive best supportive care ( BSC ) five six month . Palliative treatment systemic chemotherapy best option prolong survival maintain quality life . Patients expose active drug sometimes extend survival past two year . For many year 5 Fluorouracil ( FU ) treatment , approval irinotecan , oxaliplatin , fluoropyrimidines , well various monoclonal antibody target VEGF EGFR growth factor lead development number different regimen . The ideal combination sequence different agent still determine . Recently , Regorafenib show efficacy patient pretreated option large phase III trial , prolong OS compare placebo ( Grothey , et al 2013 ) . In addition , result confirm small randomised trial Asian population , patient less intensively pre-treated ( Li et al , 2014 ) . Therefore , regorafenib consider standard option pre-treated patient . The intended outcome successfully significantly mitigate regorafenib-induced HFSR patient able stay regorafenib longer period increase efficacy . The hypothesis underlie trial co-administration perindopril regorafenib mitigate HFSR symptom . This may case , HFSR severe addition perindopril regorafenib alone , study discontinue . As secondary endpoint , hypertension also follow .</detailed_description>
