	<detailed_description>Closed loop technology show reduce hypoglycemia hyperglycemia , well reduce glycemic variability . Several group around world investigate effort develop closed-loop system . Investigators combine two closed-loop system different mode operation order enhance closed-loop system . The two system Hybrid closed-loop system MD-Logic closed-loop system .

The two system test separately several clinical study prove safe effective diverse population patient type 1 diabetes . The MD-Logic system overnight use `` GlucoSitter '' CE mark . The primary objective study characterize overall management glycemic control use system include Safety . The data collect study use confirm/develop HLCL System . Secondary objective study include evaluation HLCL system monitor setting ( camp ) follow stress : Exercise , high carbohydrate high fat meal This study single-arm , single-center , clinic Investigation subject type 1 diabetes insulin pump therapy . Run-in Period : A total 10 subject enrol ( age 18-40 ) . A minimum 6 day run-in period sensor augment pump use collect sensor insulin data allow subject become familiar . Study Period - Camp : Following run-in period subject participate 5 day , 4 night study period camp set HLCL feature study .</detailed_description>
