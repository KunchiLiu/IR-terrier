	<brief_title>Evidence Based Colorectal Cancer Screening Uninsured - Sub-study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In previously initiate , ongoing clinical study ( # NCT01946282 ) investigator test systematic colon cancer screen outreach strategy increase screen completion among uninsured patient , up-to-date screening . This Sub-study # NCT01946282 ( IRB # 082012-086 ) . Sub-study description : The goal sub-study identify strategy may increase rate 1 ) initial participation colorectal cancer screening , 2 ) follow abnormal colorectal cancer screen test colonoscopy . At time sub-study , patient randomly assign receive gift card incentive enrol . At time standard , non-incentive invitation continue mail eligible patient . The sub-study involve 2 part : Part 1 : Participants schedule receive mail fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) outreach first time late 2nd year study randomly assign receive one three invitation letter , vary slightly one another . For sub-study , standard invitation letter replace one three sub-study letter . All new participant receive one 3 letter 2 predetermine round invitation ( involve n=2,124 individual ) . There 3 condition sub-study letter individual randomly assign 1:1:1 condition . The 3 condition follow : ) Condition 1 - control letter similar previous study letter slight word grammatical improvement , ii ) Condition 2 - cost letter control letter plus addition one sentence inform recipient average value FIT procedure ; iii ) Condition 3 - cost/future letter include average value FIT sentence assure patient follow-up test request , provide free charge . Rationale plan sub-study Part 1 : Over nearly 2 year program investigator test systematic outreach strategy increase screen completion among uninsured patient , date screening . Through carefully evaluate intervention , investigator show outreach invitation strategy , particularly include FIT invitation , markedly increase screen completion among uninsured . Thirty-six percent individual invite complete FIT return test . The investigator believe rate may improve make change invitation letter . The sub-study hypothesis provide information letter value kit attenuate concern future cost increase FIT follow-up response rate . Part 2 : In part 2 sub-study , participant receive FIT result either white envelope ( normal result , immediate follow-up necessary ) red envelope ( abnormal result , need follow-up physician ) . The change portion study color envelope patient receive . Rationale plan Part 2 : With current program , rate follow-up diagnostic colonoscopy abnormal FIT 58 % . Since individual abnormal FIT increase chance colorectal cancer , identify alternate strategy improve compliance diagnostic colonoscopy desirable . Accordingly sub-study employ simple alert tactic color envelope ( red abnormal white normal ) . The investigator hypothesize patient follow-up receive positive FIT result result message importance abnormal test red envelope . Because sub-study employed 2 predetermined round invitation , investigator opportunity conduct pre-post analysis follow-up rate test hypothesis .</detailed_description>
