	<brief_title>Macitentan Pulmonary Hypertension Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) affect 250,000 birth per year worldwide , 70-80,000 patient currently reside US . Although classically think genetic hemoglobinopathy , clinical complication vascular etiology pulmonary manifestation primary cause morbidity mortality . Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) , one pulmonary complication , occur 6-10.5 % SCD adult associate 60 % four-year survival [ 1-4 ] . No specific therapy PH SCD exist represent area intense clinical need field . Clinical trial pulmonary vasodilator medication PH SCD problematic . There randomize placebo control trial traditional pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) medication complete population date [ 5 , 6 ] . Three randomize placebo-controlled trial undertaken previously . Two compare treatment bosentan placebo SCD patient right heart catheterization ( RHC ) -defined elevated pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) ( ASSET-1 trial ) pulmonary venous hypertension ( PVH ) PVR &gt; 100 dynes.sec/cm5 ( ASSET-2 trial ) [ 5 ] . After randomization 14 subject ASSET-1 12 patient ASSET-2 , trial prematurely terminate due slow patient enrollment . Although patient enrol , apparent toxicity issue . The third trial , Walk-PHaSST ( Pulmonary Hypertension Sickle Cell Disease Sildenafil Therapy ) [ 6 ] , compare safety efficacy sildenafil placebo SCD patient TRV ≥2.7m/s . After 74 ( target 132 ) subject enrol , study prematurely discontinue due increase serious adverse event sildenafil group , primarily hospitalization pain . There number possible explanation fail trial : 1 . The hemodynamics PH SCD reflect spectrum abnormality . Approximately 40-50 % PH SCD patient hemodynamics similar form PAH ; mean pulmonary arterial pressure &gt; 25 mmHg , normal left-sided filling pressure ( PCWP leave ventricular end diastolic pressure &lt; 15 mmHg ) elevate PVR [ 1 , 3 ] . But least 50 % PH SCD patient least degree PVH usually due diastolic dysfunction leave ventricle [ 7 ] . How elevate PVR define PH SCD controversial . While typically form PAH , define 3 Wood unit 240 dynes.sec/cm5 , reflective normal PVR 120-160 dynes.sec/cm5 . In SCD , anemia-induced elevation cardiac output observe patient produce baseline PVR 60-100 dynes.sec/cm5 suggest PVR 160 dynes.sec/cm5 2 Wood unit may appropriate value [ 8 ] . 2 . SCD consider rare disease US accord NIH . As PAH SCD probably occur 2-4 % HbSS adult , many center US ( &lt; 10 ) eligible patient enrollment even best circumstance . SCD patient often co-morbidities limit participation clinical trial , often decrease number even . 3 . The epidemiology PH SCD evolve past 10-15 year . Numerous study demonstrate elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure ( PASP ) echocardiography reflect elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity ( TRV ) present 1/3 HbSS 10-28 % HbSC adult [ 9-11 ] . However , elevate TRV approximately 25 % positive predictive value PH SCD [ 1 ] . The need right heart catheterization confirm diagnosis PH SCD gain clinical acceptance past year prior clinical trial conduct , standard part PH workup patient . Given serious limitation randomize trial , clinical guideline committee decide judgment regard whether target PAH therapy indicate SCD patient elevate PVR normal PCWP inform indirect evidence Group 1 PAH population clinical experience . In Group 1 PAH patient , well-established meta-analyses randomize trial target PAH therapy consistently improve exercise capacity , functional status , symptom , cardiopulmonary hemodynamics outcome [ 12-14 ] . This indirect evidence support four case series SCD patient RHC-confirmed pre-capillary PH receive targeted PAH therapy bosentan , sildenafil , and/or epoprostenol . Targeted PAH therapy associate improvement exercise capacity , six minute walk distance increase 41 144 beyond baseline [ 15-18 ] . There also improvement mean PAP , PVR , cardiac index , although parameter measure patient [ 18 ] . The magnitude benefit greatest among symptomatic patient . The common adverse effect headache ( 15 % ) peripheral edema ( 21 % ) ; transaminase elevation report 14 % patient endothelin receptor antagonist therapy [ 15-18 ] . Based upon result increase morbidity associate sildenafil use , weakly recommend trial either prostanoid endothelin receptor antagonist select patient SCD RHC-confirmed mark elevation PVR , normal PCWP , relate symptom [ 8 ] . The FDA approval macitentan treatment PAH represent unique opportunity study use medication SCD . Endothelin-1 long establish important mediator vasoconstriction SCD [ 19 , 20 ] recent study implicate role molecule mouse model PH SCD [ 21 ] . PH elevate TRV independent risk factor mortality SCD [ 1 , 2 , 9 , 22 ] , median age death SCD patient 5th decade irrespective PH diagnosis , possibility therapeutically alter outcome key importance disease . With publication American Thoracic Society sponsor clinical guideline diagnosis treatment PH SCD ( additionally endorse Pulmonary Hypertension Association American College Chest Physicians ) , time re-addressing possibility clinical trial PAH therapy population perfect . We propose utilize information gather trial proceed specifically design clinical trial use macitentan treat SCD patient likely respond therapy ; PAH-like hemodynamics without co-existent left-sided heart disease . Hypotheses : 1 . Macitentan safe treatment patient PAH sickle cell disease 2 . Macitentan improve hemodynamics , exercise capacity quality life patient pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension sickle cell disease 3 . Long-term use macitentan improve survival patient sickle cell disease pulmonary hypertension Study Design : To conduct 16 week prospective open-labelled Phase II clinical trial macitentan SCD patient hemodynamics consistent pulmonary arterial hypertension . We plan enroll 10 patient study . All enrol patient treat 10 mg macitentan daily entire treatment period . The study comprise three consecutive period : Screening Period/Baseline Studies : This period 30 day duration , commence first screen visit complete start study medication . Treatment Period : This begin Visit 2 , baseline visit continue end 16 week therapy earlier case premature stoppage treatment . During period , safety assessment first visit follow visit assess safety efficacy week 4 , 8 , 12 16 . Post-Treatment Study Period : This last 30 day completion treatment period allow additional assessment medication safety . Screening Period : After obtain informed consent , patient undergo screen protocol include assessment baseline demographic ( sex , age , race , ethnicity , height , body weight ) , well assessment female patient child-bearing potential appropriate . The following data obtain : 1 . Medical history- To include : 1 . SCD related complication ( stroke , AVN , priapism , low extremity ulcer etc . ) 2 .
