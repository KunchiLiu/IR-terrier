	<brief_summary>This study aim develop health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) patient report outcome ( PRO ) patient receive immune checkpoint modulator ( ICM ) therapy . This instrument could use clinical trial evaluate HRQOL patient treat novel ICMs ICM combination might ultimately influence decision regulatory approval , well improve understanding chronic treatment effect patient well-being , understanding reason treatment non-adherence , develop strategy improve adherence evaluate clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Immune Checkpoint Modulators ( ICMs ) associate significant adverse event . Currently validate patient report outcome ( PRO ) tool assess health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) specifically patient receive ICMs . HRQOL multidimensional concept patient 's perceived well-being affect disease treatment . There urgent need assess impact ICMs HRQOL , good understand balance efficacy toxicity agent . This study aim develop health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) patient report outcome ( PRO ) patient receive immune checkpoint inhibitor ( ICM ) therapy ( FACT-ICM ) . The core domains FACT-ICM include physical , emotional , family social , functional well . In addition , propose study develop toxicity sub-scale related resultant toxicity ICM therapy . The HRQOL develop focus group interview patient treat ICMs , clinicians treat patient ICMs , understand treatment ICMs impact HRQOL , well explore general experience , insight concern receive ICM therapy .</detailed_description>
