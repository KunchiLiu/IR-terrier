	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Glucocorticosteroid Treatment Patients With Chronic Recurrent DILI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ) refer liver disease cause drug toxic substance . DILI clinical event associate severe outcome acute liver failure . Up , approximately 1000 drug , herbal product , vitamin illicit compound associate liver injury . Recently , incidence DILI rise . In hospital , hospitalize patient DILI increase 1.39 % 2002 2.31 % 2006 , 3.17 % 2011 , indicate 2.3-folds increase last ten years.15 % 20 % patient acute DILI prone chronic liver disease . For patient chronic recurrent DILI , routine liver protective treatment difficult rescue abnormal liver function . Moreover , increase health care cost seriously affect patient 's quality life . Glucocorticosteroids inhibit non-specific inflammation permeability capillary bile duct , limit activation T lymphocytes , selectively inhibit B lymphocytes produce antibody , thus prevent delay immune-induced liver injury . Glucocorticoid treatment severe DILI accept recognition , effect repeat episode chronic DILI , due lack randomize controlled study , still unclear . Therefore , shall design two group basis ratio 1:1 , namely , glucocorticoid treatment group standard treatment alone group . Participants glucocorticoid treatment group receive methylprednisolone,48mg/d 1st week , 32mg/d 2nd week , 24mg/d next two week , follow 16mg/d 32 week reduction dose methylprednisolone 4 mg per 4 week drug withdrawal . Participants glucocorticoid treatment group also receive standard treatment include reduce glutathione , glycyrrhizin , ademetionine , alprostadil , ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) first 12 week . Participants standard treatment group receive treatment routine liver protection drug include reduce glutathione , glycyrrhizin , ademetionine , alprostadil , ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) first 12 weeks.The efficacy safety glucocorticoid treatment patient chronic recurrent DILI observe treatment follow-up period .</detailed_description>
