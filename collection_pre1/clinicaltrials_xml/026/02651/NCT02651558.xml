	<brief_title>Optical System Continuously Measure Arterial Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measurement blood pressure anesthesia commonly perform inflation brachial cuff provide intermittent blood pressure measurement . In case , require add continuous invasive monitoring blood pressure , via insertion arterial catheter . Unfortunately , related morbidity negligible . To limit consequence gesture , development do past allow continuous non-invasive measurement blood pressure anesthesia . Unfortunately , device subject important limitation constraint use . A new system design CSEM consist optical system fix patient 's skin , absolutely non-invasive easy use . In order study reliability device , investigator plan compare blood pressure estimate gold-standard arterial catheter measurement induction general anesthesia 40 patient .</detailed_description>
