	<brief_summary>Micafungin cyclic lipopeptide antifungal agent echinocandin class . Members class antifungal agent know inhibit synthesis glucan polymer fungal cell wall . The spectrum activity micafungin include Candida ( specie , include strain resistant fluconazole ) , Aspergillus , Pneumocystis . In intensive care patient continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration ( CVVHDF ) well-established extracorporal renal replacement therapy high clearance rate . Pharmacokinetic study antifungal agent critically ill patient treat CVVHDF rare . Elimination give drug renal replacement therapy determine several major factor membrane specific , due physico-chemical property drug characteristic renal replacement technique use . Ten intensive-care patient acute renal failure suspect proven candida infection include study . 100 mg Micafungin infuse period sixty minute via central venous catheter , different venous catheter use CVVHDF . Blood sample draw day 1 2 arterial venous line extracorporeal circuit 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 24h start infusion . Plasma ultrafiltration sample , collect outlet ultrafiltrate compartment hemofilter , take correspond time . The following pharmacokinetic parameter determine : area curve ( AUC ) , half-live ( t1/2 ) , maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) elimination fraction .</brief_summary>
