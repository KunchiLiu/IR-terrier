	<brief_title>Utilization TEG Monitor Rivaroxaban Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rivaroxaban novel factor Xa inhibitor widely use stroke prevention nonvalvular atrial fibrillation , treatment venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , VTE prophylaxis patient undergo knee hip replacement surgery . Current standard measurement coagulation relatively poor reliably measure detect Rivaroxaban effect elaborate mean test measurement factor Xa activity immediately available useful Urgent situation traumatic injury emergent surgical indication . Due unmet need devise strategy detect Rivaroxaban activity urgent situation , unnecessary reversal , lead significant complication cost , often result . The investigator seek devise strategy assessment Rivaroxaban activity trauma Emergency General Surgery ( EGS ) patient available point-of-care testing . Thromboelastography ( TEG ) point care , viscoelastic measurement coagulation widely use trauma view many superior standard coagulation study assessment coagulopathy follow injury may useful detect Rivaroxaban effect trauma EGS patient assess degree functional factor Xa impairment . This propose study observational , prospective , cross sectional , study evaluate Pharmacokinetics rivaroxaban utilization thromboelastography ( TEG ) population 80 trauma emergency EGS patient take rivaroxaban prior admission 20 active control trauma EGS patient take rivaroxaban prior admission ( match age gender injury mechanism illness ) Study activity : Prior resuscitation blood , blood product , reversal agent , investigator obtain TEG well standard coagulation testing : prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , international normalize ratio ( PT/PTT/INR ) . TEG coagulation study obtain soon possible admission follow reversal rivaroxaban ( reversed SOC ) 24 hour post admission ass change . To assess efficacy TEG monitoring Rivaroxaban activity , investigator also perform battery coagulation test timepoints describe order attempt ass degree functional factor X inhibition . The coagulation battery include : thrombin time , thrombin generation , PT neoplastine , ecarin chromogenic assay , well anti-factor Xa chromogenic assay ( Rivaroxaban assay ) run Institute Transfusion Medicine . TEG compare additional coagulation assay determine whether prolongation R time ( sensitive measurement coagulation factor activity ) TEG parameter utilize reliable measurement Rivaroxaban activity . Each test perform two aforementioned timepoints : admission post reversal 24 hour post admission clinical team opt reverse patent .</detailed_description>
