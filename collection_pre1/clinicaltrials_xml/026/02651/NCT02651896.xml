	<brief_summary>Hypofractionated intensity modulate image guide radiotherapy ( HypoIGRT ) few high-fraction-size treatment would beneficial prostate cancer would deliver large biological-equivalent dose tumor would conventional treatment 1.8-2.0 Gy fraction , maintain similar low incidence late normal tissue reaction . Thus , investigator aim assess hypothesis HypoIGRT treatment localized prostate cancer improve therapeutic ratio either : 1 . Reducing normal tissue , mainly genitourinary gastrointestinal , toxicity / 2 . Improving tumour control , mainly freedom biochemical failure survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator choose study HypoIGRT regimen , participant prostate adenocarcinoma , tumor consider present low α / β , therefore benefit approach . Primary Outcome Measures : 1 . Acute late radiation induce toxicity . Secondary Outcome Measures : 1 . Freedom prostate cancer recurrence - freedom biochemical failure survival ; 2 . Cause specific overall survival 3 . Aspects quality life health economics Study Design : Allocation : Prospective allocation Endpoint Classification : Feasibility Study ( Toxicity assessment ) Intervention Model : Single Assignment Masking : Open Label Primary Purpose : Treatment Eligibility Ages Eligible Study : 18 Years old Genders Eligible Study : Both Accepts Healthy Volunteers : No Study Population : Men localize histologically confirm T1B-T4 N0 M0 prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
