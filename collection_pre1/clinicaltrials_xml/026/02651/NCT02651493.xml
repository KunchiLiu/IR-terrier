	<detailed_description>In study , investigator propose novel method detect Down syndrome use photography facial dysmorphology , tool call computer-aided diagnosis ( CAD ) . Local texture feature base Contourlet transform local binary pattern investigate represent facial characteristic . A support vector machine classifier use discriminate normal abnormal case . Accuracy , precision recall use evaluate method . After validate method , technology expand perform similar function assist detection dysmorphic syndrome . By use photography image analysis automate assessment tool would potential improve diagnosis rate allow remote , non-invasive diagnostic evaluation dysmorphologists timely manner .</detailed_description>
