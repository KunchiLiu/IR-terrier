	<brief_summary>Sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) pregnancy modifiable risk factor poor maternal fetal outcome . The investigator propose prospective observational study assess utility continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) administration ( intervention ) pregnancy reduce maternal fetal morbidity . Secondarily , also perform cohort study assess incidence antenatal sleep-disordered breathing measure ambulatory sleep monitoring apply hospital setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : CPAP application SDB-diagnosed parturients decrease fetal maternal morbidity . Specific Aims : 1 . To screen woman first trim pregnancy risk carry baby fetal growth restriction ( FGR ) presence SDB ( FGR commonly diagnose 20 week gestation ultrasound standard care ) follow diagnosis treatment CPAP , per standard care , remainder pregnancy order follow fetal maternal outcome . . Screen = parturients affirm presence snoring . b . Screen positive parturients assess 1-2 night ambulatory sleep respiration monitor confirm SDB b. SDB positive parturients offer treatment , per standard care , CPAP . c. Screen positive parturients reassess 1-2 night ambulatory sleep monitoring ( whether CPAP eventually apply ) two interval pregnancy ( second third trimester ) , 6-8 week delivery . This study design prospective observational cohort study order establish concurrence disease ( SDB ) occur increase `` risk '' exposure vulnerable state ( pregnancy ) presence diagnose fetal growth restriction . In addition , parturients test positive SDB assess pulmonologist offer standard care therapy CPAP , appropriate . CPAP use follow assessed mitigating intervention blunt fetal growth restriction . This study pilot hope establish incidence co-morbidities order appropriately plan adequate sample size future intervention study . Given large overall parturient population available study team , believe one calendar year observe sufficient patient establish relationship SDB antenatal pregnancy fetal growth restriction .</detailed_description>
