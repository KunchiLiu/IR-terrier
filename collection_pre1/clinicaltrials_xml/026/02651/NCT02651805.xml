	<brief_summary>Patients advance chronic disease may suffer respiratory secretion available therapy control condition uncomfortable little effective palliative care patient . Therefore , alternative therapy test , assess clinically relevant outcome palliative care , comfort therapy number intervention require day . Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation option present advantage , since use patient minimum cooperation non-invasive , may lead high comfort therapy . The aim study verify feasibility clinical trial compare effect Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation usual care hospitalize palliative care patient suffer respiratory secretion . Patients allocation follow `` fast-track allocation design '' , include patient randomize two group : 1 . Receive Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation therapy moment assign group ; 2. receive 24h usual care allow choose usual care Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation Therapy . The assessment : Time first intervention need follow intervention , discomfort due therapy , discomfort due respiratory secretion , palliative outcome scale , number adverse event number intervention 24h period . The primary outcome verify feasibility develop future large clinical trial ass effect use Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation control respiratory secretion patient palliative care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanical Insufflator-exsufflator Control Mucus Hypersecretion Patients Palliative Care - A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators conduct feasibility study future fast track randomized trial , carry Américo Brasiliense State Hospital conduct Spirometry Respiratory Physiotherapy Laboratory Federal University São Carlos , Brazil . The concept feasibility define `` capable do carry '' study aim verify feasibility intend verify large clinical trial would acceptable probability success prove efficacy intervention 24 . The importance feasibility study discuss since health research resource frequently waste large clinical trial intervention small impact , study insufficient power , even use measure outcomes reflect expect change cause intervention . Furthermore , study essential deal population usually lead increased chance lose follow-up high number miss data , palliative care . Both group receive therapy mechanical insufflators-exsufflator , however , Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation group receive fast track way , usual care , receive usual care 24 hour , receive one session Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation . After 24 hour period , patient ask therapy would like receive time need help deal hypersecretion end hospitalization , physician responsible patient consider hypersecretion control . The allocation fast track use due ethical reason , order maintain randomize controlled aspect research , yet provide opportunity patient benefit new intervention end study . Furthermore , increase acceptability retention participant expect , since go receive new therapy moment study , may follow-up 28 . The cross-over design chosen , since wash-out period necessary model study might lead period without treatment vulnerable patient , expect short life time . Usual Care The patient receive treatment accord hospital protocol deal hypersecretive patient ( suction precede respiratory physiotherapy nebulisation ) . A trained member nurse staff physiotherapist responsible provide therapy . A member research team collect patient ' record therapy provide staff control hypersecretion . Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation The setting use Mechanical Insufflator-Exsufflator previous study , use : six assist cough cycle pressure 40 -40cmH2O ; inspiratory time 3 ; expiratory time 4 pause cycle 4 . The patient instruct cough alongside exsufflation phase , exception Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease patient instruct exhale slowly . An oral-nasal mask use interface , patient tracheotomy , device connect .</detailed_description>
