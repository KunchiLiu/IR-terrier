	<brief_summary>Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) rare genetic metabolic disorder characterize absent severely reduce capacity catabolize circulate LDL particle hepatic LDL receptor . As consequence , HoFH subject present abnormal total plasma cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level , result severe atherosclerosis often leading early onset cardiovascular disease . Early initiation aggressive treatment patient therefore essential . Unfortunately , despite exist therapy , treat LDL-C level could remain well acceptable level . Thus , functional replacement defective LDLR via AAV-based liver-directed gene therapy may viable approach treat disease improve response current lipid-lowering treatment . This first-in-humans study intend evaluate safety gene therapy investigational product ass preliminary evidence efficacy use plasma LDL-C level surrogate biomarker human LDLR transgene expression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Gene Therapy Study Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects ask participate optional kinetics study . Subjects agree admit research inpatient unit University Pennsylvania select site LDL kinetics study prior vector administration . The LDL kinetic assessment perform use prim constant infusion deuterated leucine 12 hour repeat blood draw 48 hour . 2- 14 day follow start leucine infusion , subject admit research inpatient unit University Pennsylvania AAV8.TBG.hLDLR gene therapy vector administer . Vital sign monitor frequently 24 hour . Blood drawn safety test daily 3 day 72 hour weekly 12 week . More comprehensive assessment safety parameter occur every 4 week 12 week . Twelve week vector administration , subject participate first optional kinetics study re-admitted inpatient unit University Pennsylvania select site repeat LDL kinetics study . After visit subject permit resume LDL apheresis and/or plasma exchange , lipid lower treatment discretion care physician . Subjects safety visit blood draw every 12 week 52 week , follow bi-annual telephone call annual lipid test thereafter 260 week .</detailed_description>

Hepatitis B define positive HepB SAg , Hep B Core Ab , and/or viral DNA Chronic active Hepatitis C define positive HCV Ab viral RNA . History alcohol abuse within 52 week Certain prohibit medication know potentially hepatotoxic , especially induce microvesicular macrovesicular steatosis . These include limited : acutane , amiodarone , HAART medication , heavy acetaminophen use ( 2g/day &gt; 3 x q week ) , isoniazid , methotrexate , tetracycline , tamoxifen , valproate . Current use systemic corticosteroid active tuberculosis , systemic fungal disease , chronic infection . History immunodeficiency disease , include positive HIV test result . Chronic renal insufficiency define estimate GFR &lt; 30 mL/min . History cancer within past 5 year , except adequately treat basal cell skin cancer , squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer . Previous organ transplantation . Participation investigational drug study within 6 week prior screen visit 52 week receive AAV8.TBG.hLDLR . Any major surgical procedure occur less 3 month prior screen visit , plan future surgical procedure within 3 month baseline . Serious unstable medical psychological condition , opinion investigator , would compromise subject 's safety successful participation study . A baseline serum AAV8 Neutralizing Antibodies titer &gt; 1:10 Any medical condition find would make subject 's best interest participate study Study staff member direct family member</criteria>
