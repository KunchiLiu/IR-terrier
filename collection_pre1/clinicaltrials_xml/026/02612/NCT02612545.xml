	<brief_summary>Background : Malaria illness cause parasite enters people body mosquito bite . It cause fever , headache , body ache , weakness . If treat , make people ill. Malaria cure . A mix 2 drug work well past work well part Cambodia . Researchers want see mix 3 drug work well safe . Objectives : To see 3-drug mix use treat malaria area 2-drug mix less effective . Eligibility : People age 2 65 year mild malaria Pursat , Preah Vihear , Ratanakiri Provinces Cambodia . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , urine blood test , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . For , electrode place skin check heartbeat . Participants spend 5 night hospital . They physical exam complete symptom questionnaire daily . They give blood periodically throughout stay . For , thin plastic tube place arm vein first day , blood draw use needle do . Participants get either 2-drug mix 3-drug mix 3 day . They 2 ECGs day receive drug . Participants follow-up visit week 5 week . At visit , physical exam blood take . If sign malaria , re-treated . The study last 42 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety , Tolerability Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine + Mefloquine Compared Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine Artesunate-mefloquine Patients With Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria Cambodia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PPQ ) Cambodia frontline artemisinin ( ART ) combination therapy ( ACT ) Plasmodium falciparum malaria fail cure nearly half patient western province . These treatment failure cause parasite strain resistant ART PPQ , yet sensitive mefloquine ( MQ ) vitro vivo . These finding , previous study show PPQ treat MQ-resistant infection patient , lead u hypothesize parasite develop cross-resistance PPQ MQ . Given DHA-PPQ AS+MQ fail rapidly resistance use alone , propose treat patient triple ACT ( TACT ) contain DHA-PPQ + MQ . We believe TACT effectively cure patient either ACT alone , continue achieve acceptably high cure rate help eliminate malaria Cambodia new drug develop deploy . This protocol thus aim measure efficacy , safety , tolerability DHA-PPQ + MQ versus DHA-PPQ AS-MQ alone multi-site , open-label , randomized clinical trial . In three Cambodian province ( Pursat , Preah Vihear , Ratanakiri ) DHA-PPQ failing , recruit subject age 2 65 year uncomplicated falciparum malaria ( randomized 1:1 ) , In Pursat Preah Vihear treat either DHA-PPQ + MQ AS-MQ alone Ratanakiri treat either DHA-PPQ + MQ DHA-PPQ alone three day , follow 42 day assess recrudescent parasitemia indicator treatment failure . The main safety concern study DHA-PPQ + MQ may cause electrocardiographic ( ECG ) change could predispose patient develop clinically significant arrhythmia . This PPQ know cause prolongation ECG correct QT ( QTc ) interval , MQ may increase PPQ level ( thus risk QTc prolongation ) pharmacokinetic interaction involve CYP3A4 , liver enzyme metabolizes drug . To monitor event , obtain ECG recording drug dose . The safety tolerability TACT versus ACT also assess periodic test hematopoietic , hepatic , renal function , frequent symptom questionnaire . We also administer single low dose primaquine , kill P. falciparum gametocyte , Day 2 interrupt transmission parasites mosquito promote elimination malaria Cambodia . During hospitalization followup , obtain series research blood sample estimate prevalence genetic marker ART , PPQ , MQ resistance ; develop genotyping platform rapidly survey know drug resistance-associated mutation ; investigate genomic transcriptomic basis drug-resistance mechanism ; confirm elimination parasite gametocytes bloodstream use sensitive molecular method ; measure ex-vivo susceptibility parasites antimalarial drug , cryopreserve parasite future study elucidate molecular mechanism drug resistance .</detailed_description>
