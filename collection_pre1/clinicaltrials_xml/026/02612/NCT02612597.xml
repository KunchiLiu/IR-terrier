	<brief_summary>In study investigator would like elaborate mechanism lead high insulin sensitivity exercise train low insulin sensitivity bedrest . The investigator speculate concomitant chance blood volume train bedrest might explain changed insulin sensitivity change blood volume also dilution space glucose change . Furthermore , investigator would like work influence change capacity skeletal muscle glucose uptake glycogen storage glucose sensitivity . Therefore , A ) bed rest study healthy untrained subject B ) training study obese pre-diabetic patient conduct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Blood Volume Changes Glucose Tolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While little doubt physical inactivity lead reduced insulin sensitivity contrast hereto physical activity improve insulin sensitivity underlie mechanism still large extend unknown . With study investigator wish test two independent hypothesis may explain observed change : The first hypothesis part explanation know increase circulating level glucose response oral glucose tolerance test ( indicate reduce insulin sensitivity ) follow bed rest due concomitantly reduce blood volume thereby dilution space . In addition investigator also speculate reduce glucose response oral glucose tolerance test ( indicate improve insulin sensitivity ) training period relate exercise induced increase blood volume , hence increase dilution space . Based , hypothesis test two experimental approach ( bed rest aerobic exercise training ) , least part change observe glucose tolerance follow bed rest aerobic exercise training relate concomitantly occur change blood volume . The second hypothesis test another important contributor change circulate glucose level follow oral glucose tolerance test bed rest physical training relate diminish improved capacity skeletal muscle glucose uptake glycogen storage , respectively . The rationale fore exercise training increase skeletal muscle glycogen content storage capacity healthy type 2 diabetic patient , respectively , bed rest opposite . To test hypothesis two different intervention study conduct . Study 1 bed rest study healthy untrained subject study 2 training study obese `` pre-diabetic patient '' .</detailed_description>
