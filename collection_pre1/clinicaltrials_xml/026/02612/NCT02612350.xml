	<brief_summary>Pathway Genomics Corporation ( Pathway Genomics ) , San Diego , California company , involve development validation new molecular diagnostic assay analysis circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( ctDNA ) find plasma-derived DNA ( cell-free DNA cfDNA ) order identify specific variant ( mutation ) cancer driver gene . The purpose test mutation ctDNA detect monitor cancer . All cell shed DNA bloodstream . Finding cancer-associated mutation cfDNA may lead early detection cancer otherwise apparently healthy ( i.e . asymptomatic ) individual may allow healthcare provider effectively monitor treat know cancer patient . The analysis perform use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -based methodology oligonucleotides design target specific mutation designate gene interest follow next generation deep sequencing amplified target . Evaluation performance assay screen cancer asymptomatic subject essential clinical validation use assay . The specific aim protocol obtain relevant human blood sample individual subject high average risk development cancer due age , heredity , environmental toxic exposure use statistical analysis method adjunct screen test potential presence cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study obtain human blood sample asymptomatic subject never diagnose cancer , may increase risk cancer due heredity , exposure , age , family history assess validity screen healthy risk patient cancer via analysis ctDNA . Specifically , blood specimen collect individual respond self-administered health questionnaire screen high risk contract cancer . Each participant ask provide 30 ml blood sample drawn primary care provider ( PCP ) license phlebotomist . The specimen collect study may also use research development new modify molecular genetics assay . The result study use understanding use ctDNA detection monitoring cancer human . The blood sample collect blood collection tube ( BCT ) call Cell-Free DNA BCTÂ® manufacture Streck intend collection , stabilization transportation cell-free plasma DNA . This device also stabilize preserve cellular genomic DNA present nucleate blood cell circulate epithelial cell ( tumor cell ) find whole blood . This product clear U.S. Food Drug Administration In Vitro Diagnostic use label Streck research use . Under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) regulation , laboratory authorize validate use , part laboratory-developed test ( LDT ) , device clear approved FDA . Pathway Genomics validate CancerInterceptTM Detect molecular analysis system Streck tube , accordance CLIA . Once specimen collect send Pathway physician phlebotomist collect sample , process test conduct Pathway laboratory personnel . The analysis begin separation plasma rest blood sample . cfDNA isolated sample . The quantity cfDNA measure sample amplified via PCR next generation sequence . The result sequence analyzed presence one 96 mutation analyze assay . The data review report generate .</detailed_description>
