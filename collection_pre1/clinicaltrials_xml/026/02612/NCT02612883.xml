	<detailed_description>Surgical resection primary therapy variety benign malignant diseases gastrointestinal tract . Advances perioperative care surgical technique image modality significantly improve outcome patient major abdominal resection within past three decade . However , incidence postoperative complication major abdominal resection remain high morbidity rate 30-60 % despite gradual decrease perioperative mortality time . Persistently high morbidity rate may part explain broadened indication surgery patient relevant comorbidities and/or advanced disease require extend resection . The reduction perioperative morbidity high relevance patient , complication associate poor oncological functional long-term outcome delay therapy . In addition , complication present major cause cost health care system . Tissue perfusion critical factor tissue regeneration healing anastomosis . Compromised microperfusion area anastomosis sit likely contributes leak , easy reliable technique intraoperatively evaluate microperfusion . During post-operative period , inadequate wound perfusion impairment systemic local oxygenation represent main predisposing factor anastomotic leakage . This case gastric conduit well colonic/rectal anstomoses . For example , performance gastroplasty show associated impairment microcirculatory blood flow proximal end gastric tube , despite absence significant impairment systemic haemodynamic status . These microcirculatory impairment promote occurrence oesophageal anastomotic leakage , represent potentially life-threatening complication relate disastrous consequence leakage gastrointestinal content , mediastinitis , septic shock , acute respiratory distress syndrome death . Similar result show colorectal anastomosis . So , good microcirculatory blood flow around anastomosis could indicate optimal condition anastomotic healing . Or way around , bad microcirculatory blood flow could lead surgeon rethink plan anastomosis . Objectives : To assess association intraoperative flux measurement postoperative outcome patient undergo major abdominal surgery . Trial design : Prospective observational study . Flux measurement carry use moorVMS-LDF DUAL CHANNEL Laser Doppler Blood Flow system . The flux probe apply respective organ ( i.e . esophagus , stomach , liver , pancreas , colon , rectum ) measurement document stable signal obtain . Laser Doppler measurement allow realtime continuous monitor suitable investigation gastrointestinal microcirculation . Light generate laser diode penetrates tissue , reflect circulate blood cell . This reflect light return via optical fibre photodetector transform electrical signal , proportional number blood cell move measured volume multiply mean velocity cell , refer blood flux express perfusion unit ( PU ) . Each measurement represent mean value ( PU ) stable perfusion 1-min period without motion artefact .</detailed_description>
