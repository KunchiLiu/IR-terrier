	<brief_summary>Following informed consent registration , subject undergo tissue pre-screen eligibility screening . Tumor specimens potential subject undergo c-MET RON expression characterization . Eligible subject undergo treatment eligibility screen enrol available open molecularly define cohort . If least one response observe within cohort , consider expansion additional subject enrol . The cohort show high response rate give high consideration , determine Sponsor-Investigator . Trial accrual anticipate occur two year 21 subject enrol first stage ( 7 cohort ) opportunity additional 25 enrol cohort expand . Subjects enrol follow procedure treatment schedule , regardless cohort assignment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LCI-GU-URO-CRI-001 : Crizotinib Patients With c-MET RON-Positive Metastatic Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm two-stage phase II study design evaluate overall response rate patient metastatic urothelial cancer demonstrate c-MET RON overexpression fail prior therapy cisplatin carboplatin contain regimen . Immunohistochemistry utilized define tumor sample c-MET RON protein expression pattern assignment molecular cohort . In first stage study , seven patient enrol parallel three molecularly define cohort follow : 1. c-MET high ( &gt; 50 % ) , RON null ( 0-9 % ) 2. c-MET-positive ( 10-100 % ) , RON-positive ( 10-100 % ) 3. c-MET null ( 0-9 % ) , RON-positive ( 10-100 % ) All enrol subject continue study treatment radiographic progression base RECIST version 1.1 , unacceptable toxicity , investigator discretion , consent withdrawal . If response observe cohort Stage 1 , cohort may consider expansion , additional 25 patient may enrol cohort Stage 2 . An expansion cohort define Sponsor- Investigators follow review available trial data sponsor LCI Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) conduct first Stage 1 cohort complete accrual least every six month thereafter Stage 1 cohort complete accrual . If one cohort least one Stage 1 responder , cohort show high response rate give high consideration expansion . It possible cohort high response rate determine prior completion Stage 1 enrollment cohort . If lag enrollment Stage 1 cohort , expansion decision may make without regard lag cohort .</detailed_description>
