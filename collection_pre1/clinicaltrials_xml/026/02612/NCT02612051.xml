	<brief_summary>GSK3008348 investigational drug , develop GlaxoSmithKline Research Development Limited ( Sponsor , pharmaceutical company base UK ) treatment Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) . IPF rare poorly understood disease cause scarring lung . The main symptom shortness breath dry cough . Symptoms generally worsen time subject may prove fatal . The cause IPF unknown . This First Time Human , Phase 1 , 3-part study carry behalf Sponsor Quintiles . The primary purpose Part A examine safety tolerability single nebulised ( medicate spray ) dose GSK3008348 follow inhalation healthy volunteer . The secondary objective determine rate body absorbs , distribute , breaksdown eliminates drug . Parts B C study in-patients Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) . The purpose Part B C examine safety tolerability , much drug bind target , follow single nebulised ( medicate spray ) dose GSK3008348 follow inhalation patient Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) . The secondary objective determine rate body patient absorbs , distributes , breaksdown eliminates drug . The total duration Part A 65 - 87 day , Part B 62 day Part C 43 day .</brief_summary>
