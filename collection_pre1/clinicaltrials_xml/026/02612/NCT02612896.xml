	<brief_summary>Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis neglect zoonotic parasitic disease complex significant economic public health impact , occur primarily develop country . Humans carrier tapeworm ( taeniosis ) ; normal intermediate pig host develop metacestode larval stage ( porcine cysticercosis ) . However , people also act accidental intermediate host develop human cysticercosis neurocysticercosis ( NCC ) central nervous system involve . The scattered effort researcher evaluation control program Sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) focus single control option . It become clear stand-alone option potential reduce occurrence parasite , however either long term integrate effort seem require reach elimination status . The objective current study evaluate cost-effectiveness/acceptability elimination ( achieve short term via integrated measure ) , control ( single measure , elimination goal long term ) T. solium highly endemic area SSA . This intervention study entail elimination study arm multiple control option combine ( integrate ) aim final human host ( Mass drug administration ( MDA ) health education ) pig intermediate host ( pig treatment vaccination ) . In second study arm single control option carry ( pig treatment ) . In study arm ( health ) education implement . At baseline final sampling year , prevalence human taeniosis/cysticercosis porcine cysticercosis determine study village . Active ongoing surveillance 6 monthly ( biannual ) human pig sampling conduct elimination study arm , well two-yearly ( biennial ) sample pig intermediate host control study arm . Additionally , ( open end ) questionnaires focus group discussion administered/held obtain data cost pig keep , T. solium , intervention perception/acceptability propose control measure local community .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As T. solium zoonosis , 's control evaluate One Health perspective , tackle human pig host . The study carry Katete district , Eastern Province Zambia , area report endemic T. solium pig human . The pig intervention describe , request ClinicalTrials.gov Suitability communities Katete district assess pilot survey conduct proposer ( April 2015 ) . Two community select fulfilled eligibility criterion . The Nyembe neighbourhood community ( 1,210 people , 5 village , 520 pig ) , within Nyembe Rural Health Centre ( RHC ) catchment select elimination study arm ; Chimvira neighbourhood community ( 1,470 people , 11 village , 827 pig ) , Mtandaza Rural Health Centre catchment , select control study arm . The interventional study entail high-input elimination study arm ( E ) , multiple control option target final ( human , mass drug administration , health education ) intermediate ( pig ) host ( treatment vaccination ) , combine ; lower-input control study arm ( CI ) , use single control option target porcine host ( treatment ) . Teams suitably qualify trained human veterinary medical staff go door-to-door household study community . Procedures include collection qualitative quantitative data human participant pig ; subject-related intervention human participant pig ; laboratory analysis collect sample . For baseline survey , one randomly-selected consent adult member one randomly-selected assenting ( parental consent ) child member ( 5 year ) household sample ( serum : diagnosis human cysticercosis ; stool : diagnosis taeniasis ) , whereas subsequent survey elimination arm ( see protocol specific time point ) , eligible consent member elimination community invite participate ( stool sample : diagnosis taeniasis ) . All eligible consent member control arm include final study sampling ( stool : diagnosis taeniasis serum : diagnosis cysticercosis ) . It expect age , sex socioeconomic group equally represent . For socio-economic questionnaire , 50 % household randomly select head household address . The school base questionnaire administer grade 5-6 child attend school study community . For perception questionnaire : also 50 % household target ( random selection ) , data saturation reach . For focus group discussion ( FGD ) : 6 FGD ( 3 time 10 men , 3 time 10 woman ) conduct elimination study arm , 12 control study arm ( 6 iteration involve 10 men 6 iteration involve 10 woman ) , define time point ( table 1 ) , data saturation reach .</detailed_description>
