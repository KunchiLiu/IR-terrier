	<brief_summary>The creatinine clearance measure use two consecutive 24 hour urine collection , objective minimizing error due poor quality urine collection . The GFR measure reference method , estimation blood creatinine level ( eGFR ) MDRD study formula may confound variation muscle mass , therefore creatinine production , follow bariatric surgery . The method remain center , therefore consistent give patient , throughout duration study . The GFR measurement perform stop medication block RAAS , reduce diuretic one week , introduction increase alpha-blocker centrally-acting hypotensive agent . If impossible stop RAAS-blockade ( heart failure ) , dose least reduced one week . This precaution require minimize bias functional renal insufficiency state extracellular hydration difficult assess obese subject . Subsequent measurement GFR perform way . The choice tracer measure GFR may vary accord study center . 51Cr-EDTA , 99Tc-DTPA , iohexol inulin may utilize . Because assessment edema hazardous extremely obese patient kidney disease favor edema formation , simplify single injection method determination plasma clearance measurement tracer reliable . Only constant infusion method use measure GFR . Briefly , GFR determine calculate glomerular clearance ( Cl ) plasma concentration ( P ) renal excretion per unit time ( UxV ) infusion constant plasma level tracer ( Cl=UxV/P ) . The result give mean value several consecutive clearance . Because correct urine collection key procedure , seven collection period ( instead 5 usually ) perform calculation mean clearance . Bladder catheterization use anticipated patient void satisfactorily . In last 30 consecutive patient mGFR 60 ml/min/1,73m2 , occur twice subject 70 79 year old . Therefore , might occur exceptionably study . Raw data center send coordination center ( Nice ) examine validate calculation mean clearance value . To aim , extreme non-representative clearance exclude . At least 3 7 period take account calculate mean value . For instance , last 30 consecutive patient mGFR 60 ml/min/1,73m2 , investigator consider average 4.7 period obtain mean non-indexed GFR value 40,7 ± 2,5 ml/min . Primary assessment perform one year , previous study already suggest significant benefit within period [ 66 ] , surgery ca n't delay patient strongly expect intervention , follow-up extend three year end study , order document whether initial benefit surgical intervention maintain . - A reduction absolute value measure GFR ( mGFR ) follow bariatric surgery expect first six month surgery ( M0 - M6 ) . However , weight loss may allow increase mGFR indexed body surface area M6 , towards M12 . - investigator expect subsequent stabilization mGFR M12 M36 bariatric surgery group , seek measure anticipate reduction mGFR control group remain state glomerular hyperfiltration . All relevant cardiovascular , metabolic nutritional parameter necessary study risk/benefit ratio intervention analyze . - Primary : bariatric surgery slow progression chronic kidney disease obese . - Secondary : bariatric surgery improve survival , cardiovascular prognosis , metabolic , nutritional inflammatory parameter , quality life , access transplantation sub-group patient whose GFR &lt; 20ml/min/1.73m2 inclusion , could chance loss patient delay surgery one year .</brief_summary>
