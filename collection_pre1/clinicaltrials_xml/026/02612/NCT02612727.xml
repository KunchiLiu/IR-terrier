	<brief_summary>At present , much sub-Saharan Africa , include Nigeria resource-limited country , without ready access CPT , due factor include lack PT device , expensive require consistent electric power operate . NHB significant cause neonatal morbidity mortality , preventable appropriate treatment initiate . We show FS-PT safe efficacious treatment mild-moderate NHB . The major goal study demonstrate FS-PT efficacious treatment significant/severe NHB , generally define TB ≥12-14mg/dL ( specially define need phototherapy per American Academy Pediatric 2004 guideline ) . It do 3 site Nigeria ( 2 Lagos , Nigeria 1 Ogbomoso , Nigeria ) . The rationale conduct study Nigeria , country afford effective commercial light device and/or reliable electric power operate , filter sunlight phototherapy might offer safe effective treatment neonatal jaundice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Filtered Sunlight Phototherapy Treat Significant Jaundice : Safety Efficacy Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia ( NHB ) progression kernicterus lead cause deaths disability among newborn develop world , particularly sub-Saharan Africa include Nigeria . Many infant live villages/towns far clinical facility capable provide conventional artificial blue light phototherapy ( CPT ) standard treatment NHB industrialize world . Hence , baby succumb preventable tragedy principally account lack electricity and/or available/affordable CPT . To make treatment NHB readily available , design test novel , yet simple , practical alternative device deliver blue light PT underserved area filter sunlight . The investigator pilot study demonstrate appropriately filtered sunlight phototherapy ( FS-PT ) offer safe affordable treatment infant mild-moderate NHB , also less efficacious CPT . Other study show faster decline high bilirubin ( TB ) level high irradiances . The next logical step move urgently need exciting therapy forward test FS-PT infant significant/severe NHB define American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) criteria high-risk infant . In , investigator potentially prevent acute bilirubin encephalopathy ( ABE ) kernicterus many infant .</detailed_description>
