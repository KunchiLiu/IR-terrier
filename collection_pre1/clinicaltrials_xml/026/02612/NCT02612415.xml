	<brief_title>FIRST-line Support Assistance Breathing Children ( FIRST-ABC ) Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breathing support common intervention provide critically ill child paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) . Although invasive breathe support ( deliver tracheal tube ) lifesaving , concern regard risk ( infection lung damage ) prompt great use non-invasive respiratory support ( NRS ) . However , little scientific evidence guide PICU clinicians comparative effectiveness commonly use mode NRS . In feasibility study , investigator test whether possible conduct randomise clinical trial compare two mode NRS : continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , use two decade , high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) , new method respiratory support . It known sure useful HFNC critically ill child publish research compare CPAP . However , since HFNC easy use well tolerated child , many hospital use HFNC instead CPAP . Before HFNC widely adopt , clinical trial establish role management critically ill child urgently need . As part study , investigator randomly allocate child deem require NRS treat clinician either HFNC CPAP . The investigator mainly ass whether sufficient number child recruit trial , whether clinician willing randomise child , test propose treatment pathway CPAP HFNC . The trial run six month , recruit 120 sick child three National Health Service ( NHS ) hospital . Consent seek parents/guardians child include study , usually CPAP HFNC start , unless emergency life-saving treatment require , case consent defer time discus study parents/guardians .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible patient fall one two group : Group A ( Stepup ) 1 . Age &gt; 36 week correct gestational age &lt; 16 year , AND 2 . Deemed require noninvasive respiratory support treat clinician acute illness , AND 3 . Satisfies one follow criterion : Hypoxia ( oxygen saturation &lt; 92 % fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) &gt; 0.40 , equivalent ) . FiO2 0.40 roughly equates standard unhumidified nasal cannula oxygen deliver 6 L/min oxygen deliver via facemask without rebreather bag 610 L/min . Acute respiratory acidosis ( pH &lt; 7.3 concomitant pCO2 &gt; 6.5 kPa ) Moderate respiratory distress ( use accessory muscle , subcostal intercostal recession , tachypnoea age , grunt ) Group B ( Stepdown ) 1 . Age &gt; 36 week correct gestation &lt; 16 year , AND 2 . Deemed require noninvasive respiratory support treat clinician extubation , follow spell invasive ventilation Either immediately extubation 'planned ' procedure , irrespective clinical condition ( 'planned ' ) OR Prompted deterioration clinical condition within 72 hour extubation ( 'rescue ' ) . Clinical parameter assess need NRS situation similar point 3 Group A . 1 . Deemed treating clinician require immediate intubation/invasive ventilation due severe hypoxia , acidosis and/or respiratory distress , upper airway obstruction recurrent apnoeas 2 . Tracheostomy place 3 . Preexisting airleak syndrome ( pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum ) 4 . Midfacial/craniofacial anomaly ( unrepaired cleft palate , choanal atresia ) recent craniofacial surgery 5 . Agreed limitation intensive care treatment plan place ( 'not intubation ' ) 6 . On domiciliary noninvasive ventilation prior PICU admission 7 . Managed either HFNC and/or CPAP ( form noninvasive ventilation BiPAP ) precede 24 hour 8 . Previously recruit study PICU admission 9 . Can treat HFNC Unavailability appropriate size nasal prong Unavailability HFNC device 10 . Can treat CPAP Unavailability right size face mask , prong patient interface Unavailability CPAP device</criteria>
