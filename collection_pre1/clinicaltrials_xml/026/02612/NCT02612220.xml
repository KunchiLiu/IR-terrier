	<detailed_description>Hepatic resection primary therapy various hepatobiliary disorder . Advances preoperative imaging , surgical technique , perioperative management markedly improve outcome extend indication hepatic resection within past three decade . However , liver resection remain associate substantial morbidity mortality 60 % 10 % , respectively . The outcome patient undergoing hepatic resection closely link amount intraoperative blood loss . Hemorrhage resection surface contribute significantly amount blood loss . In addition , bile leakage resection surface present persistent clinical challenge . In fact , bile leakage remain frequent complication hepatic resection incidence 5 - 25 % . Various topical agent far suggest facilitate hemostasis ultimate aim improve perioperative outcome . However , none agent far gain wide acceptance , possibly due impractical method application . Furthermore , 'hemostatic agent ' primarily design improve hemostasis show effect perioperative complication particular incidence bile leakage . The present randomized control trial evaluates efficacy safety BioFoam® Surgical Matrix patient undergo elective liver resection . In contrast topical agent , surgical adhesive BioFoam® Surgical Matrix may accelerate hemostasis also facilitate seal bile duct thus potential reduce incidence postoperative complication .</detailed_description>
