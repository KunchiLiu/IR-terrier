	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's disease ( CD ) chronic relapse inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . At time diagnosis possible predict course disease , range flare lifetime uncontrollable disease lead hospitalization , surgery stoma . There continuous need improve diagnostic prognostic tool . In chronic inflammation disease excessive turnover extracellular tissue . Tissue broken small fragment release circulation . Changes amount fragment blood may provide information damage quality affect tissue may therefore act objective measure disease burden severity - call biomarker . The potential biomarkers evaluate combined cross-sectional longitudinal survey include 300 patient UC , CD , irritable bowel disease healthy control . The patient follow 1 year . Changes biomarker correlate standard marker inflammation active disease remission . Perspective The use new biomarkers may offer tool evaluate early change gut patient IBD , may supplement diagnosis , serve marker effect treatment prognosis , time good alternative fecal sample endoscopy .</brief_summary>
