	<brief_summary>SNX-5422 pro-drug SNX-2112 , potent , highly selective , small-molecule inhibitor molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) . Initial vitro evidence support SNX-5422 may active TP53 null tumor irrespective tumor type .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study SNX-5422 TP53 Null Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The tumor suppressor gene TP53 cod central regulator DNA-damage-response pathway , activation lead cell-cycle arrest DNA repair , apoptosis , senescence transcription-dependent transcriptional-independent activity . Somatic TP53 gene alteration frequent human cancer . SNX-5422 pro-drug SNX-2112 , potent , highly selective , small-molecule inhibitor molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) . Inhibitors chaperone protein Hsp90 current interest central role Hsp90 play maturation maintenance numerous protein critical tumor cell viability growth . SNX-2112 retains activity cell line loss TP53 gene one alleles . SNX-2112 display good activity cell line TP53 null/TP53 wild type ( e.g. , MEC-1 [ chronic lymphocytic leukemia ] ) TP53 null/TP53 mutation ( e.g. , EBC-1 , NCI-H520 [ NSCLC - squamous cell carcinoma ] ) . Even extreme case TP53 lose allele , i.e. , cancer cell totally devoid TP53 gene ( e.g. , H1299 , KATO III , HL-60 , SK-MES-1 ) , SNX-2112 retains activity It appear SNX-2112 could active hematological solid tumor TP53 null status .</detailed_description>
