	<detailed_description>The aim study increase patient ' physical activity use dedicate cellular application encourage patient adhere doctor recommendation personal basis . Primary outcome In diabetic patient : measuring increase daily physical activity In cancer patient : improvement quality life correlation level physical activity Secondary outcome In diabetic patient : improve glycemic control assess sequential blood test HbA1c . The patient fill quality life questionnaire ( SF36 ) recruitment 6 month . After 6 month patient also fill questionnaire experience use app . Each recruit patient Android base smart phone . Each patient provide : 1 . Approval join experiment 2 . Age , gender , height 3 . Telephone number ( SMS ) Length intervention - least 6 month per patient . Each patient randomly assign one two group , specify feedback relative others weekly reminder exercise . Number patient : 1 . Diabetes : 150 patient , 50 control . 2 . Cancer : 100 patient , 20 control . All patient receive instruction importance physical activity personal recommendation activity level , n session activity per week , time span per session ( i.e. , least 2 hour walk per week divide 3 walking session per week ) Patients treatment arm receive least n ( number commend session ) message per week positive feedback activity perform negative feedback perform . At choose day week patient receive summary exercise week . Feedback Possible feedback ( NOTE - actual feedback message participant receive , therefore second person ) : 1 . Negative feedback : `` You need exercise reach activity goal . Please remember exercise tomorrow '' . 2 . Positive feedback : 1 . Relative self : `` You 're exercise level higher last week . Keep good work '' 2 . Relative others : `` You 're exercise average person . Keep good work '' 3 . Control arm : `` Did remember exercise ? '' Technical requirement 1 . App - collect physical activity send server . App run background without need restart reboot . 2 . Server - Collects physical activity Feedback policy The experiment two phase feedback . Phase 1 The investigator begin data , policy stage follow : 1 . Positive feedback send day user surpass 1/7th weekly activity day . 2 . Negative feedback send every 3 day , activity n't pass 1/7th activity . Each day , probability 0.2 , random decision feedback make . This phase last approximately 4 week . Phase 2 Using learn algorithm ( see ) computer adjust feedback , decide daily feedback ( positive \ negative \ none ) . Policy learn The investigator start simple policy learn strategy , later use sophisticated method state-space representation user . The initial algorithm represent user day use follow attribute : 1 . Demographics ( age gender ) 2 . Expected versus actual activity level week ( ratio two ) 3 . Last feedback give ( positive \ negative ) 4 . Day week ( use week-long cycle ) . The goal algorithm give feedback today encourage activity tomorrow . When train algorithm , computer feature vector comprise attribute , matrix action ( day ) . The output predict whether activity level follow day ( t+1 ) . There two type feedback depend weekly daily behavior : Weekly goal Not achieve Achieved Daily goal ( day ( t+1 ) ) Not achieve 1 1+alpha Achieved 1+alpha 1 ( alpha &gt; 0 ) The algorithm pay high penalty , example , give day message encourage activity , weekly goal achieve compare . For simplicity , initial learn algorithm linear , enough data collect . That , give matrix : X = ( demographic , expect vs. actual activity , last feedback , day week , action ) And vector show amount activity follow day , weight table , denote Y , learn vector weight w : X * w = Y . In phase 2 project computer use learn algorithm . Exploration ( random action give day ) continue throughout phase level .</detailed_description>
