	<brief_title>Arimoclomol Prospective Study Patients Diagnosed With NiemannPick Disease Type C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo control therapeutic study patient confirm diagnosis NiemannPick disease type C ( NPC ) . Patients must either 1 ) complete Visit 2 ( end study [ EOS ] ) CTORZYNPC001 study 2 ) meet eligibility criterion study include requirement stable treatment miglustat 6 month ( miglustat therapy ) prior enrolment study . Aim : The purpose study assess efficacy safety arimoclomol ( compare placebo ) administer add-on therapy patient 's current prescribe best standard care ; patient 's standard care may , may , include miglustat . Randomisation : Patients randomise receive placebo arimoclomol ( allocation ratio 1:2 ) . Pharmacokinetic evaluation ( age 12 ) : To confirm select dose , patient le 12 year age undergo arimoclomol single-dose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) evaluation randomisation start continuous ( multiple dosing ) treatment . Early Escape Clause : In patient whose disease progression severe and/or fast , `` early escape clause '' allow Investigator apply escape route implies patient treat arimoclomol ( per blind phase study schedule ) follow annual basis arimoclomol receive EU MA analysis data control , 12 month blind phase study period support efficacy and/or safety arimoclomol . Study duration : The duration blind phase study period 12 month . Following , patient offer continue extension phase study every patient receive arimoclomol follow attend site visit 18 month 24 month ( randomisation ) annual basis thereafter.The extension phase run arimoclomol receive Regulatory Approval analysis data control , blind phase 12 month study period support efficacy and/or safety arimoclomol .</detailed_description>

Sexual abstinence consider highly effective birth control method define refrain heterosexual intercourse study 1 week last dose IMP ( female patient childbearing potential ) 3 month last dose IMP ( male patient female partner childbearing potential ) . The reliability sexual abstinence need evaluate Investigator relation duration clinical trial prefer usual lifestyle patient . •Ability comply protocolspecified procedures/evaluations schedule visit .
