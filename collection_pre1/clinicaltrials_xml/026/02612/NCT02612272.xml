	<detailed_description>Introduction Background Min et al . perform double blind study compare triamcinolone ketorolac total 32 patient subacromial impingement syndrome find improve outcome University California Los Angeles shoulder rating scale , improve active abduction , forward flexion strength patient satisfaction score . Shortcomings study include short-term follow ( 4 week ) , lack control form treatment subacromial impingement include physical therapy injection without ultrasound limit ability determine accuracy injection . Many patient also lack MRI , thus unable determine patient undiagnosed rotator cuff tear pathology may influence outcome . Karthikeyan et al . perform similar trial analyze tenoxicam ( another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication ) methylprednisolone 58 patients.Six week injection , Constant-Murley shoulder score , Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand score significantly improve steroid group compare tenoxicam injection . Oztuna et al . randomize thirty patient grade II III osteoarthritis effusion aspiration oral tenoxicam 10 day aspiration intra-articular tenoxicam . The patient follow 2 , 4 8 week 3 month interval . Patients intra-articular tenoxicam significantly few effusion 1 year rapid relief joint pain . Unlu et al analyze 69 patient knee arthritis compare weekly injection tenoxicam 3 week PO tenoxicam three week . They compare two group patient receive physical therapy . No significant difference find oral intra-articular administration . Both oral intra-articular tenoxicam significant improvement knee pain Several study note safe intra-articular injection ketorolac follow knee arthroscopy . Given finding investigation describe , study compare equivalence intra-articular ketorolac injection intra-articular betamethasone injection symptomatic treatment knee osteoarthritis . In study review study , complication list syncopal episode occur corticosteroid administration . Research Questions Hypotheses This study compare efficacy intra-articular betamethasone injection intra-articular ketorolac injection symptomatic treatment knee osteoarthritis . The null hypothesis study intra-articular ketorolac injection equivalent intra-articular corticosteroid decrease patient symptom measure Western Ontario McMaster University Index ( WOMAC ) score ( primary outcome ) . Secondary outcome include change KOOS KOS-ADL score physical exam finding If equivalence proven , study may provide safe alternative medication compare betamethasone intra-articular injection osteoarthritic pain control . Methods Procedures Patients recruited St. Luke 's Orthopaedic Specialists ( SLOS ) office knee osteoarthritis treat associated St. Luke 's Health University Network . The study double-blinded , two study arm : 1 ) 4cc 1 % lidocaine , 1cc 0.9 % normal saline 1cc ( 6 mg ) betamethasone ; 2 ) 2cc ( 60 mg ) ketorolac 4cc 1 % lidocaine . The medication prepare site-specific designee ( essential personnel ) appropriate , up-to-date HIPPA ( Healkth insurance portability Accountability Act ) CITI ( Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative ) training require prepares injection routine scope SLOS practice . The content injection blind investigator cover syringe white tape . The medication generate time patient enrollment office injection perform . Patients randomize following procedure . A spreadsheet generate study patient identifier number numerical order ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc. ) . This spreadsheet locate password-protected database continuously update across St. Luke 's Network multiple study personnel time . A random number generator ( http : //randomizer.org ) use generate series binary number , either 0 1 . The number 0 represent betamethasone , number 1 represent ketorolac . This number attach study patient identifier number . When patient determine eligible enrollment study , medical record number enter password-protected spreadsheet database next patient site-specific designee . At point site-specific designee provide medication describe earlier injector . The injector patient remain unaware content syringe . Prior injection , patient receive follow study questionnaire : WOMAC , Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Physical Function Short Form ( KOOS-PS ) , Knee Outcome Survey Activities Daily Living Scale ( KOS-ADL ) . These study questionnaire create Google Forms store spreadsheet describe earlier . Patients instructed return complete questionnaire office office visit , mail fill online prior study injection well 2 week , 1 month , 3 month 6 month . Patients ' medical history take clinical exam perform injection give . Demographic information , include body mass index ( BMI ) , duration disease , gender , obtain . Number type prior injection also document known patient document patient 's chart . The clinical exam include joint laxity , passive range motion , presence contracture , tenderness scale 0-3 ( 0 = tenderness , 1 = patient wince 3 = withdrawal ) . A three-view x-ray also obtain recent image file . Other treatment modality , include physical therapy , knee off-loading brace , acetaminophen , current oral non-steroidal treatment , note . Finally , Kellgren-Lawrence Staging perform medial , lateral patellofemoral joint . This information document password-protected Google Spread Sheet . A standard superolateral injection site use medication administration . This site consider accurate , especially among experienced hand . The administration site clean ethanol swab allow dry . An 18 gauge needle connect syringe fill study drug administer . If effusion , 22 gauge needle 6cc study drug inject administration site . All study drug administer intra-articular fashion . The needle removed bandage apply . It document patient felt relief immediately follow injection . If patient history diabetes , record morning fasting level glucose 10 day follow administration study drug document password-protected Google spreadsheet . All patient provide option home outpatient physical therapy regimen follow treatment arthritis . During follow ask compliance therapy document password-protected Google spreadsheet . Clinical follow perform 1 , 3 6 month injection . A repeat examination questionnaire perform documented time . The investigator allow patient receive second corticosteroid administration three month visit current standard care St Luke 's University Health Network . If recent MRI obtain within year prior treatment , information also document . In knee osteoarthritis patient , common concern corticosteroid injection include skin color change , systemic elevation blood sugar , may place patient high risk infection immunocompromised individual . Typically injection corticosteroid limit often give every three month . Ketorolac non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication limit mechanism action may safer alternative corticosteroid injection . Expected adverse effect ketorolac include localized bruising , compensatory effusion , minor localize bleeding , flare reaction . Both medication currently use practitioner St. Luke 's University Health Network osteoarthritis . The goal study directly compare ketorolac 's efficacy safety betamethasone Statistics Sample size calculation ass equivalence base research Unlu et al ( 2005 ) compare WOMAC score patient knee osteoarthritis receive intra-articular tenoxicam , oral tenoxicam exercise . Three identified small clinically meaningful margin determine equivalence intra-articular ketorolac intra-articular betamethasone active comparator . At α = 0.5 β= 0.90 , 204 patient per group ( N=408 ) require . To guard miss otherwise unusable data , 10 % added minimum sample size , total 448 patient . The primary outcome ( change WOMAC score ) analyze via repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) , secondary outcome analyze via select ANOVA nonparametric test deem appropriate . For analysis , p &lt; .05 denote statistical significance , adjustment multiple comparison . Plan Dissemination Project Results This project submit annual resident ' fellow ' Research Symposium Bethlehem campus spring 2016 , well apply present appropriate national meeting . This project also submit orthopaedic related journal . This study register ClinicalTrials.Gov . Personnel Qualifications Primary personnel responsible compilation publication result would include Gregory F Carolan , MD ( principle investigator ) , Paul Morton , MD , Shane McGowan , MD John Anagostakos . Personnel administer injection obtain consent physician physician assistant ( list attach ) St. Luke 's Orthopaedic Specialists group , scope current practice , evaluate treat patient knee osteoarthritis . All list personnel maintain appropriate CITI HIPPA training .</detailed_description>
