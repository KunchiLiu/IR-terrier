	<brief_title>Lung Cancer Indicator Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Approximately 75 % patient lung cancer present advance disease . For stage 1 disease , chance cure 70 % . Therefore , diagnostics may aid identification early stage lung cancer play important role future screen program . Because cancer cell characterize change metabolism relate uncontrolled growth , detection result metabolite may novel diagnostic tool early stage lung cancer . Subsets metabolites volatile exhale so-called volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) . Analysis exhale VOCs suggests differ patient advanced lung cancer healthy control . The Lung Cancer Indicator Detection ( LuCID ) study aim validate use high-throughput breath analysis technique population patient clinically suspect lung cancer . Methods LuCID international , multi-center case-control study . Patients refer GP treat specialist diagnostic work-up lung cancer invite participate study . A maximum six-hundred patient consent partake study ask provide breath sample prior diagnostic procedure . This non-invasive procedure require patient breath normally facemask collect 2.5L breath amount approximately 10 minute breathe . The result sample analyze VOCs Gas Chromatography couple Mass Spectrometry Gas Chromotography couple Field Assymetrical Ion Mobility Spectrometry . The result VOC profile use generate diagnostic algorithm order try differentiate patient without lung cancer intention diagnose population . This study interfere standard care offer clinical site . Outcomes The result study provide detailed insight accuracy test detection lung cancer intention diagnose population . This form foundation subsequent study population risk development lung cancer . If sufficiently accurate early stage disease , analysis breath VOCs could help implement large-scale screening lung cancer , significantly decrease morbidity mortality disease .</detailed_description>
