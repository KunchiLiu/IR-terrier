	<brief_title>Alfapump System Versus Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Paracentesis Treatment Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include patient decompensated liver cirrhosis recurrent refractory , regular requirement large volume paracentesis ( see subject inclusion criterion ) . With respect TIPS-contraindications patient assign two substudies . If TIPS-contraindications exists ( sub-study 1 ) patient randomize Alfapump TIPS . The presence least one TIPS-contraindication ( sub-study 2 ) lead randomization Alfapump standard care . All patient receive medical care cirrhosis ascites accord institution 's standard medical care .
