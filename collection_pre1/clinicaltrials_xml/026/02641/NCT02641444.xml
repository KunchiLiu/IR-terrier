	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find drug Truvada® ( tenofovir/emtricitabine ) , Isentress® ( raltegravir ) , Reyataz® ( atazanavir ) , Sustiva® ( efavirenz ) , Selzentry® ( maraviroc ) get intestines female genital tract . All drug effective reduce number HIV viruses blood , however unknown drug move around inside tissue HIV might hide . This study determine specifically tissue drug HIV locate use new technology take creates picture tissue . This information help scientist determine best way make new drug target hidden HIV tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design This observational study TFV , FTC , RAL , ATZ , EFV , MVC localization within GALT ( terminal ileum &amp; rectum ) , vaginal , cervical tissue set undetectable plasma HIV . Participants select basis receive either TFV/FTC/RAL , TFV/FTC/ATZ/r , TFV/FTC/EFV , TFV/FTC/MVC part ongoing HIV care . After participant education , informed consent , screen study eligibility , participant evaluate baseline . All sample collect course 36 hour inpatient visit describe . Study Sampling 1 . Blood plasma collect enrollment ( approximately 2 hour start inpatient visit ) start bowel preparation ( approximately 2-12 hour start inpatient visit ) . 2 . Vaginal cervical tissue collect enrollment ( approximately 2 hour start inpatient visit ) start bowel preparation ( approximately 2-12 hour start inpatient visit ) . 3 . Rectal terminal ileal tissue collect approximately 18 hour initiation bowel preparation . Pharmacokinetic Analysis All blood , cervical , vaginal , ileal rectal tissue sample analyze Clinical Pharmacology Analytical Chemistry Laboratory ( CPAC ) UNC School Pharmacy , direct principal investigator , Angela Kashuba , PharmD . To visualize ARV localization within tissue , one biopsy tissue site analyze IR-MALDESI use previously establish workflow laboratory . HIV localization within tissue perform use situ hybridization ( ISH ) collaboration Haase lab University Minnesota . This group substantial experience HIV RNA detection human tissue , preliminary study confirm ability detect HIV RNA serial slice tissue . Localization within tissue slice evaluate IR-MALDESI . Measurement distribution ARV within pre-specified anatomical sub-regions across tissue slice allow identification area drug either concentrate lacking . ISH IHC analysis serial tissue slice allow u co-localize ARVs HIV HIV target cell . Once anatomical area visually identify , image software use isolate quantify signal .</detailed_description>
