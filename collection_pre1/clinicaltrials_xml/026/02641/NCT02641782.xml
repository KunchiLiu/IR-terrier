	<brief_summary>Although five year survival rate child high risk neuroblastoma increase last three decade 4 44 % ( 1 ) , neuroblastoma second frequent cause cancer relate death childhood ( 11 % ) . Most patient show good initial response rate ( complete ( CR ) partial remission ( PR ) rate 95 % ) , 55 % experience largely treatment-resistant tumor progression . Recently , breakthrough immunotherapy report US investigator Children 's Oncology Group ( 2 ) use anti-ganglioside D2 ( GD2 ) monoclonal antibody ch14.18 tumor cell destruction granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) plus interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) immunostimulation . This immune therapy result increase 20 % Event free survival ( EFS ) 2 year randomization . However , associate high toxicity rate ( pain , capillary leak syndrome ) . The propose trial compare Childrens ' Oncology Group ( COG ) `` standard care '' arm ( anti-GD2 + GM-CSF + IL-2 i.v . + retinoic acid oral ) experimental arm ( anti-GD2 + GM-CSF + IL-2 s.c. + retinoic acid oral ) design reduce toxicity . The potential benefit trial consist confirmation American trial design feasible independent set patient different precede therapy , different time point regard immune reconstitution autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) , feasibility newly design immunotherapy ( hopefully less toxic ) investigation immune response parameter . This pilot study prerequisite consecutive randomize clinical trial compare two immunotherapeutic approach large set patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuroblastoma second frequent solid tumour ( 7.6 % ) second cause cancer relate death ( 11 % ) childhood . In particular large high risk ( HR ) group remain challenge Paediatric Oncologists . Although 5 year survival rate child HR disease increase last 3 decade 4 44.4 % , vast majority child finally succumb disease [ 1 ] . Most patient show good initial response chemotherapy ( CR + PR-rate 95 % ) , majority experience highly treatment resistant tumour progression ( 55 % ) . Therefore new therapeutic modality urgently need . Recently , randomize trial demonstrate immunotherapeutic concept use anti-GD2 antibody ch14.18 together interleukin 2 , GM-CSF retinoic acid improve outcome neuroblastoma patient achieve CR good partial remission ( VGPR ) response precede therapy . This treatment associate high rate toxic effect ( neuropathic pain 52 % patient , capillary leak syndrome 23 % ) . An early study use antibody ch14.18 alone make comparable observation : pain despite analgesia see 33 % patient severe capillary leak syndromes 3 151 child . Differences report frequency due different definition side effect . The investigator therefore propose randomized clinical trial compare COG immunotherapy concept newly design hopefully equally effective less toxic concept . This modify application route IL-2 i.v . s.c. increase IL-2 dose 6.0 mio/m²xd ( 3.0 first week 4.5 mio second week i.v. ) . Oral retinoic acid use arm . The propose randomized trial answer follow question : ( ) Confirmation feasibility apply COG immunotherapy consolidation treatment different remission induction therapy patient recurrent de novo high risk neuroblastoma ( ii ) Investigation feasibility apply new immunotherapy concept patient recurrent high risk neuroblastoma ( iii ) Comparison toxicity immunotherapy regimens aim reduce grade 2 - 4 toxicity experimental arm . ( iv ) Comparison immune response ( antiidiotype antibody , immune cell phenotype , immune mediator , functional assay antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) complement dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) treatment cycle ( intraindividual ) , treatment arm ( interindividual ) recurrent newly diagnose patient ( v ) Comparison pharmacokinetics antibody ch14.18 arm ( 12.10 . ) ( vi ) Comparison therapeutic efficacy response evaluation end 25 week treatment ( descriptive ) . ( vii ) Comparison patients´ QoL experience immunotherapy regimen indicate parent rating appropriate questionnaire .</detailed_description>
