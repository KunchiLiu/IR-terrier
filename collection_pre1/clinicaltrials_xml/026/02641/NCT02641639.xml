	<detailed_description>This multicenter , multinational , randomize , double-blind , 2-arm , parallel-group , Phase 2/3 study evaluate efficacy safety PCC plus bevacizumab CA4P versus PCC plus bevacizumab placebo subject platinum-resistant ovarian cancer ( prOC ) . Subjects platinum-resistant , recurrent , epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer randomize 1:1 receive PCC plus bevacizumab CA4P PCC plus bevacizumab placebo . Subjects stratify select chemotherapy ( PLD vs. paclitaxel ) , platinum free interval ( &lt; 3 vs. 3 6 month last platinum therapy subsequent progression ) , line therapy ( 2nd vs. 3rd ) . This 2-part study , consist Phase 2 , exploratory study ( Part 1 ) follow Phase 3 , pivotal study ( Part 2 ) . Both part study similar overall design . Approximately 80 subject randomize Part 1 approximately 356 subject randomize Part 2 . All subject randomize receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously ( IV ) Days 1 15 , repeat every 4 week ( q4wk ) PCC paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 , repeat q4wk , paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV Days 1 , 8 , 15 , repeat q4wk PLD 40 mg/m2 IV Day 1 , repeat q4wk . Subjects Treatment Arm also receive CA4P 60 mg/m2 day bevacizumab ( Days 1 15 , repeat q4wk ) , subject Control Arm receive placebo day . Order dose follow guidance list study bevacizumab CA4P / Placebo dose day PCC , - Bevacizumab follow CA4P / Placebo follow 1-3 hour paclitaxel , - PLD follow bevacizumab follow CA4P / Placebo Subjects continue randomize treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , investigator decision , withdrawal consent , sponsor discontinues study reason . Subjects undergo tumor assessment ( RECIST ) baseline every 8 week CA-125 level baseline every 4 week . The primary endpoint PFS . Secondary endpoint include ORR , OS , proportion subject remain progression free 6 , 9 , 12 month , safety . Endpoints compare Treatment Arm Control arm . The study duration estimate last approximately 3 year . This study 2 part overall design . Part 1 enroll approximately 80 subject include multiple interim analysis test safety efficacy assumption specific subject population . Upon meet certain efficacy criterion Part 1 , protocol amend additional site add order enroll additional 356 subject Part 2 study . Subjects enrol Part 2 analyze separately use stand-alone confirmatory efficacy study .</detailed_description>
