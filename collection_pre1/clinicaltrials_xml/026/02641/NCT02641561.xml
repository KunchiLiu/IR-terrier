	<brief_summary>Post-ERCP pancreatitis well-known sometimes life-threatening complication ERCP . Both LR rectal indomethacin show benefit prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis . Despite , study date evaluate measure prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis . It hope evaluate combination two modality prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis compare either modality alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lactated Ringers With Without Rectal Indomethacin Prevent Post-ERCP Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) commonly use diagnostic therapeutic intervention use Gastroenterology . At Cooper University Hospital ( CUH ) , perform approximately 700 ERCPs per year . A known complication ERCP post-ERCP pancreatitis . The incidence post-ERCP pancreatitis cite anywhere 2.6-3.5 % case . Also , severe acute pancreatitis cite rate 0.32-0.4 % death 0.11 % . Recent literature cite use several modality useful prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis . Among modality evaluate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) , specifically rectal indomethacin , demonstrate benefit prevent post-ERCP . In particular Elmunzer et al demonstrate benefit sphincter oddi dysfunction ( SOD ) deem `` high risk '' post-ERCP pancreatitis . Other medication octretoide corticosteroid show mixed result . Additionally , recent study demonstrate use lactated ringer 's solution ( LR ) lieu normal saline ( NS ) patient 's acute pancreatitis . Due thought process recent study evaluate use LR prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis . The result study show patient receive aggressive LR hydration develop post-ERCP pancreatitis . As rectal indomethacin LR infusion appear definitive evidence prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis , hope evaluate combination two therapy prevention post-ERCP pancreatitis . This double blind , randomize prospective cohort study involve 4 treatment group undergo ERCP . All treatment arm shall receive consent , pre-procedural risk stratification , demographic data pre-procedural liker pain scale . All subject shall receive study subject number undergo randomization . All subject also receive post-procedural likert pain scale assessment , day 1 30 questioning . Treatment arm shall separate whether subject high risk define . Time 0 ( Visit 1 ) : Subjects undergo standard pre-procedural evaluation nursing , anesthesia consent procedure/anesthesia . The subject shall evaluate study participation subsequently consent desire part study . They may also undergo informed consent prior day procedure normal office visit . All subject must Liver function test ( LFTs ) , amylase lipase level draw prior ERCP test . Subjects exclude study participation acute pancreatitis define ; The diagnosis AP often establish presence 2 3 follow criterion : ( ) abdominal pain consistent disease ( ii ) serum amylase / lipase great three time upper limit normal , / ( iii ) characteristic finding abdominal image The day procedure , nurse shall obtain intravenous peripheral access ( standard ERCP ) . Initial demographic data risk factor data shall obtain . Subjects shall randomize one four study arm give study number randomly generate : Pending treatment arm patient enrol subject shall receive listed therapy undergo procedure . Post-procedure intervention perform ERCP shall record patient go standard recovery process . Post-procedure recovery anesthesia , patient shall evaluate presence pain ERCP test standard likert pain scale . If subject 's pain substantially increase baseline , subject shall admit hospital LFTs , lipase amylase level shall draw abdominal imaging order need admit physician ( standard care ) . Time 1 Days ( Visit 2 via phone ) : Subjects shall call 24 hour ERCP ass ; 1 . Presence/absence pain 2 . If pain , severity 3 . Performance amylase lipase 4 . Whether admission , urgent care emergency department visit occur Time 1-30 Days The investigator await subject laboratory value &gt; 3 time upper limit normal contact subject via phone . Time 30 Days ( Visit 3 via phone ) : Subjects shall contact via phone 30 day ERCP ass ; 1 . Presence/absence pain 2 . If pain , severity 3 . Whether admission , urgent care ED visit occur healthcare facility 4 . Study summary To detect difference 0.24 v 0.05 minimum 48 per group would need ( use p=0.05 ) . Descriptive statistic use summarize demographic variable age , gender , race , length stay , well diagnosis disease characteristic reason ERCP , disease intervention , pain , outcome variable . Data table generate variable mean , SD , median , IQR , CI . The Chi-Square test use determine main effect treatment ERCP induce pancreatitis . Nonparametric test use analyze categorical data normally distribute data analyze use ANOVA look treatment effect variables interest . Binary Multinomial Logistic Regression use examine predictor outcome within treatment across treatment build interaction model ( e.g . reason ERCP , intervention type ) . Data analysis perform use Systat version 13 SPSS version 22 . A p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
