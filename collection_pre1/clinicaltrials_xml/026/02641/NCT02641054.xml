	<detailed_description>Phase IIa study , 1:1 randomize , double blind placebo- control , cross-over . Each volunteer patient randomly assign receive CVXL-0107 placebo add-on PD therapy crossed-over arm second sequence study . They assess acute levodopa challenge test one intake study drug placebo supra-optimal dose levodopa 2 week daily treatment study drug placebo . Patients cross-overed treatment reassess second acute levodopa challenge test 2 week daily treatment study drug placebo . The study evaluate anti-PD anti-dyskinesia efficacy CVXL-0107 measure MDS-UPDRS part III ( Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ) levodopa-induced dyskinesia measure AIMS ( Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ) .</detailed_description>
