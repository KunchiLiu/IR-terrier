	<detailed_description>Currently , recommend resuscitation paradigm involve `` crystalloid-first '' approach . This approach reserve potent potentially toxic colloid patient already expose large amount crystalloid may also experience delay correct shock . This observational retrospective cohort study aim identify predictor large volume resuscitation ( LVR ) model potential benefit , cost clinical outcome albumin saline non-saline fluid patient receive large volume resuscitation . Further analysis assess risk acute kidney injury ( AKI ) hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis ( HCA ) associate resuscitation fluid choice examine long term outcome development end stage renal disease post-discharge mortality 1 year follow hospital discharge patient treat various fluid type This study utilize data large , heterogeneous cohort ( n=~65,800 ) critically ill patient admit ICU 12 year period University Pittsburgh Medical Center . The study population consist patient receive large volume resuscitation ( define &gt; 60ml/kg single 24 hour period ) separate analysis group base fluid administer define 24 hour large volume resuscitation window . Patients present AKI HCA prior large volume resuscitation exclude . AKI `` Severe '' AKI diagnose base KDIGO criterion within 72 hour follow LVR . Metabolic acidosis base arterial blood gas measurement base deficit &gt; 2 mEq/l , patient chloride ion contribute majority acidosis diagnose Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis . Mortality 30 , 90 , 365-days ICU admission ascertain use social security death master file . Propensity score model use determine adjust relationship clinical outcome type fluid resuscitation employ .</detailed_description>
