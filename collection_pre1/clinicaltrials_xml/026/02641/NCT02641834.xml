	<detailed_description>Nutrition able substantially alter health status general population . In industrialized country Italy important association diet health certainly relationship cardiovascular disease , lead cause death disability . The ability identify certainty , therefore , relationship diet cardiovascular disease appear key element implementation specific primary prevention strategy . Cardiovascular disease would result interaction genetics environmental factor . Many study evaluate association food group , food , nutrient chronic disease , consensus role nutritional factor etiology common disease , cardiovascular neoplastic disease , gradually emerge . Recent study focus examine impact whole dietary approach rather isolate single nutrient ; recognize analysis single nutrient ignore important complex interaction component diet , importantly , people eat isolated nutrient . The optimal dietary strategy prevention chronic degenerative disease remain challenge highly relevant preventive health issue . Over last year , numerous evidence exist relationship nutrition chronic degenerative disease lead investigator search optimal dietary pattern maintain good health status . Several model diet impose public attention , get interest certainly Mediterranean vegetarian diet . These dietary pattern seem exert protective effect blood pressure , lipid profile , cardiovascular disease metabolic parameter . The term Mediterranean diet widely use describe traditional dietary habit people Crete , South Italy , Mediterranean country decade 1960s . Since first data Seven Countries Study , several study different population establish beneficial role main component Mediterranean diet occurrence cardiovascular disease chronic degenerative disease . This dietary pattern characterize plentiful plant food ( fruit , vegetable , bread , form cereal , bean , nut , seed ) , olive oil principal source fat , moderate amount dairy product ( mainly cheese yogurt ) , low moderate amount fish poultry , red meat low amount wine consume low moderate quantity , usually meal . The vegetarian diet diet excludes use animal food ( meat , fish ) fresh , preserve and/or process . The increase number vegetarian attributable health , ethical , environmental , social concern . Recently , meta-analysis conduct group reveal , population 2 million people , strict adherence Mediterranean dietary pattern associate significant improvement health status , see significant reduction overall mortality ( 10 % ) incidence and/or mortality cardiovascular disease ( 9 % ) . During past decade , gradual abandonment dietary pattern inhabitant Mediterranean basin , especially young generation . Several factor contribute nutrition transition , enhance commercial availability food , urbanization life , overall improvement socioeconomic condition Europe , increase food energy supply make food ( especially animal origin ) affordable . Consumption milk , meat animal fat product increase Mediterranean country . Moreover , stressful lifestyle , less time spend cooking , enhance variety availability household appliance also propose determinant nutrition transition . Because grow evidence favor link red processed meat cardiovascular disease risk , cancer diabetes , interest towards vegetarian diet increase . In last year , number subject begin adopt vegetarian dietary pattern enormously increase respect past , population vegetarian limit select cohort . Such increase mainly attribute supposed beneficial effect dietary pattern versus occurrence disease . Health benefit Mediterranean vegetarian diet widely describe case-control prospective cohort study last 50 year . There several beneficial nutrient abundant diet , monounsaturated fatty acid , high amount fiber antioxidant low intake total saturated fat . However , unclear whether establish health benefit vegetarian attributable absence meat diet , increased consumption particular food component ( ) pattern food eaten within vegetarian diet healthy lifestyle component often associate vegetarianism . In recent systematic review meta-analysis carry 130,000 vegetarian , plant-based diet associate many health benefit . Main finding vegetarian diet determines , among case-control study , low level important risk factor chronic disease , along reduce risk occurrence ischemic heart disease ( -25 % ) cohort prospective study take account . Currently randomize control trial compare , high-risk group patient risk factor cardiovascular disease , efficacy nutritional intervention base Mediterranean vegetarian dietary pattern . From comparison would may possible obtain interesting result order identify optimal diet prevention cardiovascular disease . OBJECTIVES : The primary aim study compare effect vegetarian diet risk marker ( anthropometric biochemical measure ) associate cardio-metabolic disease ( CMD ) 3-month dietary-intervention phase , compare Mediterranean diet . Secondary objective study : - To improve knowledge pathophysiological role vegetarian Mediterranean diet cardiovascular prevention - To evaluate feasibility degree adherence dietary substitution vegetarian diet omnivorous population - To evaluate ability nutrition education intervention reduce fresh process meat consumption subject high cardiovascular risk , order enhance health quality life - To explore impact food price consumption evaluate overall cost buying food product different dietary pattern STUDY DESIGN The study randomize , open , cross-over trial design test whether vegetarian diet would benefit cardiovascular risk profile participant , compare Mediterranean diet . The eligible participant randomly divide two group , assign either experimental group ( Group 1 ) , receive vegetarian diet , control group ( Group 2 ) , receive Mediterranean diet . Following first intervention phase , subject cross order obtain second intervention phase . Both diet isocaloric last three month . The whole trial include five clinical visit . STUDY POPULATION Subjects primary prevention low-middle cardiovascular risk ( 1-5 % accord guideline European Society Cardiology ) , determine presence BMI &gt; 25.1 kg/m2 2 concomitant metabolic risk factor .</detailed_description>
