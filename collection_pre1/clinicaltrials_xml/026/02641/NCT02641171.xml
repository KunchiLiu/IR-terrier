	<brief_summary>This study evaluate use exhale air analysis tool monitor disease activity Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) . This study validation previous finding . In study participant ask donate exhale air , blood sample fecal sample . The breath sample use measure various volatile metabolite breath . The breath air next use validate previous finding . The blood sample use define origin volatile metabolite breath . Finally , potential exhale breath analysis non-invasive marker diseases activity compare establish fecal calprotectin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Volatiles Exhaled Breath Blood Crohn 's Disease : Validation Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent study ( doi : 10.1097/Mib.0000000000000436 ) show potential analysis exhale air differentiate active inactive state Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) . Although , molecule find cohort show potential differentiate CD patient remission active disease , validation outcome perform new population . One crucial pathophysiologic factor CD excessive lipid peroxidation oxidative stress , i.e . overproduction oxidant compare protective antioxidant . Oxidative stress potential aetiological factor and/or trigger factor CD . Many volatile compound include hydrocarbon aldehyde produce oxidative stress non-invasively measure exhaled air 5 , 6 . However , exhale breath contains volatile metabolite originate previous current uptake environmental contaminant , interestingly metabolism foreign organism ( bacteria , virus , fungi yeast ) . Therefore , important study exhale air also blood blood borne volatile molecule measure . Since current study also aim validate use volatile molecule exhale air non-invasive marker disease activity CD patient , investigator compare outcome exhale air analysis currently establish non-invasive measure disease activity , i.e . fecal calprotectin .</detailed_description>
