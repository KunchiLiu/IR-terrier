	<brief_summary>The main goal study identify characterise anatomical component replication competent HIV-1 ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 ) reservoir . The investigator hypothesize clinically relevant HIV-1 reservoir hide various specific anatomic compartment able rebound therapy stop . This reservoir probably small HIV-1 reservoir hide blood could transcriptional active specific environment , possibly influence low concentration antiretroviral therapy . The current proposal , first time , identify source viral reservoir phylogenetically backtrack viral genome rebound virus sequence viral DNA ( DeoxyriboNucleic Acid ) different anatomical compartment . The subsequent characterization viral reservoir marker ( size , integration site , methylation profile , stimulation inhibition assay ) enable u understand viral rebound occur .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Documented HIV1 infection , subtype B Able willing provide write informed consent Age = &gt; 18 year &lt; 65 year Nadir CD4 ( cluster differentiation 4 ) count &gt; =300/µl . CD4 count screen &gt; 500/μl Patient take ART ( antiretroviral therapy ) least 2 year change ART least 90 day prior study entry . Patients integrase inhibitor + 2 nucleoside analog base regimen PI base regimen . Patient viral load &lt; 20 copies/ml determine CobasTaqMan HIV1 test v2.0 assay least 2 year . ( Occasional `` blip '' permit ) ( A blip define intermittent viremic episode viral load detection level 200 copies/ml return undetectable level next control , six month prior study entry ) Last viral load undetectable Ability attend complete schedule assessment patient visit . Ability willingness blood tissue sample collect store indefinitely use various research purpose . Women childbearing potential partner use double barrier contraception study . Females reproductive potential ( woman postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month , i.e. , menses within precede 24 month , woman undergo surgical sterilization , specifically hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy and/or bilateral salpingectomy ) , need negative serum urine pregnancy test within 48 hour prior study entry . NOTE : Acceptable documentation hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral salpingectomy , tubal microinserts , partner undergone vasectomy , menopause participantreported history . All participant must agree participate conception process ( e.g. , active attempt become pregnant impregnate , sperm donation , vitro fertilization ) . Participants must agree use barrier protection sexual activity participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , participant/partner must use least two reliable form contraceptive ( condom , without spermicidal agent ; diaphragm cervical cap spermicide ; IUD ( intrauterine device ) ; hormonebased contraception ) study . Previous current history opportunistic infection . ( AIDS define event define category C CDC ( Center Disease Control Prevention ) clinical classification ) . History resistance antiretroviral drug , document genotyping . Hepatitis B surface antigen positive HBV ( Hepatitis B virus ) viral load positive past evidence subsequent seroconversion ( =HBV antigen viral load negative positive HBV surface antibody ) . HCV ( Hepatitis C virus ) antibody positive result within 60 day prior study entry , HCV antibody result negative , positive HCV RNA ( Ribonucleic Acid ) result within 60 day prior study entry Significant risk HIV superinfection treatment interruption . Current known history cardiomyopathy significant ischemic cerebrovascular disease . History HIVrelated thrombocytopenia . Active renal disease ( defined glomerular filtration rate ( calculate Cockcroft Gault equation ) 50ml/min presence HIVAN ( HIVassociated nephropathy ) past medical history . Current known history cancer ( exception situ cervix carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin ) within five year prior screen . Pregnancy breastfeed . Any condition , include psychiatric psychological disorder , opinion investigator interfere trial conduct safety participant . Previous participation trial evaluate immune modulating agent Abnormal laboratory test result screen : 1 . Confirmed Hemoglobin &lt; 11g/dl woman &lt; 12 g : dl men 2 . Confirmed platelet count &lt; 100000/l 3 . Confirmed neutrophil count &lt; 1000/μl 4 . Confirmed AST ( aspartate aminotransferase ) and/or ALT ( alanine aminotransferase ) &gt; 2x ULN ( Upper Limit Normal ) The following treatment prohibit three month screen course study : 1. immunosuppressive drug ( inclusive corticosteroid ) exception drug use topical use . 2 . Immunomodulatory drug include limited Granulocyte colony stimulate factor , Granulocytemonocyte stimulate factor , interleukin 2 , 7 &amp; 15 . Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion site investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . Acute serious illness , opinion site investigator , require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 60 day prior entry .</criteria>
