	<detailed_description>Primary light chain amyloidosis ( AL ) common systemic amyloidosis , result plasma cell dyscrasia , hematological malignancy . It cause restrictive cardiomyopathy ( AL-CMP ) 70 % individual . AL-CMP lethal stage 4 lung cancer lethal form restrictive heart disease ; untreated , mortality rate 50 % within 18 month . Moreover , myocardial dysfunction , hallmark AL-CMP , significantly increase early treatment related mortality , predominantly cardiovascular death , powerful predictor poor long-term survival . Two potentially treatable mechanism underlie myocardial dysfunction—mechanical effect amyloid toxic effect circulate light chain/ amyloid interactions—and predispose heart failure , arrhythmia , sudden death individual AL-CMP . Until , effort determine mechanisms AL-CMP hamper lack animal model limitation noninvasive technique directly image myocardial amyloid . A recent breakthrough , 18F-florbetapir PET/CT , provide first time specific quantitative imaging myocardial amyloid include toxic amyloid protofibrils . Furthermore , propose investigate three pre-clinically proven pathway light chain toxicity humans—myocardial oxidative metabolism , oxidative stress , coronary microvascular function . Our central hypothesis myocardial 18F-florbetapir retention biomarker aggressiveness AL-CMP effective chemotherapy , reduce circulate light chain , decrease aggressiveness AL-CMP improve oxidative stress , myocardial oxidative metabolism , microvascular function contractile function , prior improvement myocardial amyloid content . In Aim 1 , quantify myocardial 18F-florbetapir retention marker aggressive myocardial disease individual AL-CMP active plasma cell dyscrasia compare control individual AL-CMP long-term hematological remission . In Aim 2 , propose , use advanced imaging , assess effect light chain reduction due chemotherapy myocardial structure , function , metabolism define time course change . Serial ECV strain image CMR , serum F2-isoprostanes peroxynitrite level , myocardial oxidative metabolism ( Kmono ) coronary flow reserve 11C-acetate PET , 18F-florbetapir image intricately characterize myocardial substrate AL-CMP , also identify change response therapy . The propose study offer potential transform current understanding AL-CMP restrictive heart disease cause passive amyloid-related architectural damage complex disorder result passive aggressive factor . The result study may form foundation drug discovery program prevent cure AL-CMP .</detailed_description>
