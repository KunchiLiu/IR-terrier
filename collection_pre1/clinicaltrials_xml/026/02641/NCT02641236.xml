	<brief_summary>This research study participant undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) risk develop acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . GVHD complication HSCT immune cell donor cause inflammation injury tissue organs HSCT recipient . Vancomycin-polymyxin B ( commonly call `` vancopoly '' ) oral antibiotic give people undergo allogeneic HSCT preventive measure acute GVHD . This research study study effect vancopoly microorganism live intestine stem cell transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research study Phase 2 clinical trial . Phase 2 clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . Pre-clinical study perform 1970 's show kill bacteria intestine oral antibiotic could decrease risk acute GVHD follow allogeneic HSCT . Based observation , many stem cell transplant center adopt practice `` gut decontamination '' oral antibiotic preventive measure acute GVHD . There standard regimen gut decontamination transplant center , definitive human study show gut decontamination beneficial lowering risk acute GVHD . Recent study adult patient undergoing stem cell transplant indicate type bacteria live intestine influence bone marrow transplant outcomes survival development acute GVHD . Some type bacteria may protective GVHD others may increase risk GVHD . Based new research , possible practice gut decontamination ( `` vancopolys '' ) may beneficial HSCT patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria Patients Undergoing Allogeneic HSCT Recipient 10/10 ( HLAA , B , C , DRB1 , DQB1 ) match bone marrow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) OR 6/6 ( HLAA , B , DR ) match cord blood allogeneic HSCT . Participants may underlie malignant nonmalignant hematologic disease , except primary immunodeficiency , indication allogeneic HSCT . Participants must receive myeloablative conditioning regimen . Antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) condition regimen permit . Graftversushost disease ( GVHD ) prophylaxis calcineurin inhibitor shortcourse methotrexate without steroid . Age ≥ 4 year old toilettrained . Participants must able deposit stool sample directly stool collection container . Stool specimens diaper difficult obtain prone sample error , particularly loose liquid stool common peritransplant period . Lansky/Karnofsky performance status ≥60 % ( see Appendix A ) Ability understand and/or willingness parent legally authorize representative sign write informed consent document Eligibility Criteria Healthy Bone Marrow Donors Healthy individual , age ≥ 4 year toilettrained , identify BCH DFCI provider fullymatched , sibling bone marrow donor transplantation also eligible participate study . Patients undergo allogeneic HSCT correction primary immunodeficiency disorder ( e.g . SCID ) . Recipients mismatch allogeneic HSCT . Patients receive reducedintensity ( nonmyeloablative ) condition regimen . Patients age ≤ 10 year undergo HSCT match sibling donor . These patient low risk acute GVHD receive gut decontamination per institutional standard practice . Participants receive GVHD prophylaxis drug calcineurin inhibitor , methotrexate steroid . History allergic reaction attribute oral vancomycin oral polymyxin B . Participants undergo active therapy immunemediated infectious colitis upon admission allogeneic HSCT . Participants receive antibiotic therapy treatment bacterial infection bacterial prophylaxis upon admission allogeneic HSCT . Use agent ( e.g . sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim ) prophylaxis Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia permit . Concurrent use antifungal antiviral therapy also permit . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
