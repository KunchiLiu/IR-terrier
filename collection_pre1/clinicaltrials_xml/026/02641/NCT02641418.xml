	<brief_summary>Background : Peripheral arterial disease result atherosclerotic occlusion major artery supply low limb associate increased risk mortality morbidity . It result restrict blood flow skeletal muscle cause intermittent claudication ( IC ) . IC present cramp like pain affect 5 % population &gt; 50 year associate substantial reduction walk capacity , quality life diminish physical function . Supervised exercise programme demonstrate improve maximum walking distance NICE recommend group-based supervised exercise treat patient IC . However , significant variability impact treatment across study little agreement underlie mechanism whereby exercise increase functional outcome . Potential mechanism include skeletal muscle metabolism , VO2 max , anaerobic threshold endothelial function . Studies need well understand exercise improve outcome , good refine target treatment . The participation patient IC exercise programmes low . The investigator need understand factor influence participation improve number patient IC benefit programme The research consist two workstreams : Workstream one Objective : Assess extent patient baseline characteristic candidate physiological mechanism associate clinical improvement IC patient participate exercise programme Patients : Patients document IC refer Vascular Consultant . Eligible patient invite participate 12 week supervise exercise programme . Testing Schedule : Measurements record baseline ( prior exercise ) , immediately completion exercise programme three month . Measurements include : Baseline characteristic might predict outcome : - Quality life use VascuQol questionnaire - Clinical indicator low limb function : Ankle brachial pressure index ( ABPI ) , intermittent claudication distance ( ICD ) , Maximum walk distance ( MWD ) . Candidate physiological mechanism - Aerobic capacity ( VO2 max &amp; AT ) - Muscular strength endurance - Muscle morphology ( include muscle thickness , pennation angle , fascicle length elastography ) - Endothelial function ( sheer stress response measure flow mediate dilation ) Analysis : Regression analysis use explain variation patient maximum walk distance 3 month . The regression use 9 candidate measure physiological response 3 baseline measure explore mechanism patient factor may associate clinical improvement . 100 patient recruit 2 year give 90 % power detect additional increase variability MWD explain candidate measure around 5 % 0.05 significance level . This research use identify type exercise may influential improve outcome patient . Workstream two Objective : Explore reason behind patient ' participation , non-participation , experience adherence exercise programme . Study Design : An interview study patient IC routinely refer supervised exercise . Three group patient invited participate . Those : - Choose participate exercise programme ( Group A ) - Agree participate exercise programme ( Group B ) . - Agree participate discontinue least one session ( Group C ) . Semi-structured face-to-face interview 20 patient per group , interview conduct use topic guide ensure consistency . The format flexible allow participant generate naturalistic data consider important / successful term outcome . Data analyse thematically manage use Nvivo software - approach inductive iterative . This research use redesign current exercise programme improve participation impact exercise patient IC .</brief_summary>
