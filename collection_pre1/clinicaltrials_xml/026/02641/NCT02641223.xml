	<brief_summary>For study investigator conduct five-day trial period spinal cord stimulator ( SCS ) effectivenessâ€”once patient deem possible SCS candidate , trial lead implant asked return clinic five day evaluate effectiveness trial . The primary outcome study comparison daily energy expenditure ( EE ) , unit kcal/day , prior trial implantation SCS lead external pulse generator . Patients wear accelerometer device twenty-four hour day five day prior trial lead implantation obtain baseline value , trial lead implanted procedure clinic , continue wear accelerometer another five day . Baseline post-SCS energy expenditure value compare . The secondary outcome study step take , hour sleep , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI , describe appendix 1 ) pre post trial implantation period . SCS research procedure study , rather part routine medical care patient would benefit procedure .</brief_summary>
