	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma second frequent cause death cancer childhood . Already one year diagnosis recurrence high risk neuroblastoma , 75 % patient experience progression . Metronomic therapy target tumor cell , also tumor supply vasculature interaction Tumor immune cell . The toxicity expect low due low ( continuous ) dose drug . The study investigate tolerance efficacy new combination five drug consist propranolol ( antiangiogenetic , anti-neuroblastic ) , Celecoxib ( modulate immune response , ant-neuroblastic ) , cyclophosphamide ( antiangiogenetic , anti-neuroblastic ) , etoposide ( antiangiogenetic , anti-neuroblastic ) , vinblastin ( antiangiogenetic , anti-neuroblastic ) . Vinblastin schedule every 14 day intravenously , drug apply daily throughout 365 day ( except etoposide 4x3 week ) . The efficacy drug demonstrate vitro vivo animal study . All drug use child condition . From experience low toxicity favorable Quality life expect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuroblastoma relapse intensive therapy likely result presence primary acquire drug resistance . Therefore , new therapeutic modality salvage therapy urgently need . The historical Kaplan-Meier curve 218 unselected high risk patient first recurrence ( CR ) first progression ( PR/SD ) demonstrate 1 year event free survival rate 25.2 ± 2.9 % 1 year overall survival rate 42.7 ± 3.3 % . Today cancer widely consider multicomponent disease . One novel strategy likely target complexity tumor cell tumor environment metronomic scheduling anticancer treatment `` metronomic treatment '' ( MT ) . Low dos chemotherapeutic drug continuously administer cancer patient . The high frequency lower dose target distinct aspect cancer 's functionality . Effects tumor-angiogenesis , anti-cancer immunity tumor stroma show . Additionally low-dose metronomic treatment often combine modern antiinflammatory antiangiogenic drug , specifically interact e.g . tumor growth angiogenesis pathway . The rationale trial efficacy metronomic therapy heavily pre-treated refractory neuroblastoma patients.This trial protocol propose metronomic schedule low dose chemotherapy cyclophosphamide , etoposide vinblastine , combination propranolol , non-selective blocker β adrenergic receptor celecoxib , selective cyclooxygenase type 2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor . Patients enrol study may benefit two reason . In palliative situation , metronomic treatment may result disease stabilization ( SD ) significant improvement quality life ( QOL ) patient e.g . decrease pain treatment . For reason , QOL include pain module assess separate secondary objective/ outcome measure . In case tumor response ( PR , CR ) , patient may qualify subsequent treatment approach aim disease stabilization even long-term benefit .</detailed_description>
