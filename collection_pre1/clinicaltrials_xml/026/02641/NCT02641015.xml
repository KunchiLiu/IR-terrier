	<brief_title>Study Assess Management Outcomes Hospitalised Patients With Complicated UTI ( RESCUING )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacterial resistance antimicrobial drug major public health problem . Of great concern rapid emergence dissemination resistance third generation cephalosporin Enterobacteriaceae , especially Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae . This frequently see association resistance class antibiotics lead multidrug resistance ( MDR ) profile . These MDR isolates often involve complicate urinary tract infection ( cUTI ) , associate poor clinical outcome . In addition , last decade emergence carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae , also resistant antibiotic carbapenems , leave therapeutic option . The overall aim study provide information epidemiology , clinical management outcome patient hospitalise cUTI , include pyelonephritis . To achieve aim , investigator perform multicentre retrospective observational study patient hospitalise cUTI . The study conduct several European country plus Israel , high prevalence MDR Gram-negative bacteria ( GNB ) , include Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The study seek identify possible modifiable risk factor treatment failure , especially related antibiotic therapy . On completion study , investigator develop well understand clinical management hospitalise patient cUTI due MDR GNB European country . The investigator identify modifiable risk factor treatment failure . This information use inform well clinical antibiotic management cUTI improve patient outcomes . The study also use development hypothesis future randomise control trial cUTI new antibiotic . Dissemination result take place peer-reviewed publication conference presentation .</detailed_description>
