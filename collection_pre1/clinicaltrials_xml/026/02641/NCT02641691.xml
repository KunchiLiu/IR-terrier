	<brief_summary>The purpose research study look tumor respond short course radiation ( 5 day ) follow 4 cycle chemotherapy . The standard treatment people stage I rectal cancer complete surgical removal tumor associate area , often mean creation permanent ostomy . Recent research show use organ preservation strategy show benefit people advance rectal cancer , investigator propose use similar treatment strategy study see non-operative less drastic operative therapy ( potentially avoid permanent ostomy ) feasible .</brief_summary>
