	<brief_summary>The three-month short-course treatment isoniazid [ H ] rifapentine [ P ] ( 3HP ) recently recommend Centers Disease Control Prevention could dramatically increase number person start complete treatment latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) , TB provider nationwide hamstrung requirement 3HP administer directly observe therapy ( DOT ) patient watch take medication dose in-person . We develop novel mHealth application allow patient make send video medication dose ingest watch healthcare provider via HIPAA-compliant website remotely monitor LTBI treatment adherence ( Video DOT [ VDOT ] ) . This study determine whether monitor patient VDOT achieve high treatment completion rate great patient acceptability low cost clinic-based in-person DOT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VDOT Monitoring Adherence LTBI Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Building novel VDOT System include text message reminder HIPAA-compliant cloud-based administration , hypothesize VDOT expand provide high treatment completion rate low cost in-person DOT LTBI treatment use 3HP . We propose randomize controlled trial address follow specific aim : Aim 1 : To determine whether LTBI treatment completion adherence great patient treat 3HP administered via VDOT versus in-person DOT , identify patient factor associate outcomes ; Aim 2 : To compare acceptability treatment patient VDOT versus in-person DOT , identify factor associate difference acceptability ; Aim 3 : To calculate cost-effectiveness VDOT compare in-person DOT administer 3HP . To address study aim conduct randomize controlled trial TB contact refugees San Diego prescribe 3HP LTBI treatment physician randomly assign monitor adherence via either VDOT in-person DOT ( Figure 2 ) . Approximately 100 patient per year three year ( n=155/arm ) recruit San Diego County TB Control Refugee Health Program ( TCRHP ) clinic trial . Patients assign VDOT give smartphone service teach send video take weekly medication dose ; patient in-person DOT arm visit clinic week observe healthcare worker take LTBI medication . Medication adherence monitor participant take 12 dos 16 week ( limit recommend CDC complete treatment ) , compare treatment adherence rate patient acceptance across trial arm . Participants complete brief ( 20 minute ) baseline follow-up assessment interview obtain information potential confounders effect modifier adherence patient acceptance regard treatment administration method . Cost-benefit analysis also conduct assist develop policy around use VDOT 3HP . Since participant recruit prescribed 3HP healthcare provider patient care continue provider , medication prescribe treatment decision make study .</detailed_description>
