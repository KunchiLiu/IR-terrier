	<brief_summary>Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) effective treatment option individual debilitate tremor respond medical therapy . However , severe tremor , particularly develop central nervous system insult multiple sclerosis , comprise several underlying component represent dysfunction within distinct brain circuit . Some dysfunctional brain circuit successfully treat DBS others respond poorly DBS therapy . For severe tremor , difficult discriminate underlying component patient movement disorder exclusively dependent upon clinical expertise . Even extensive clinical experience , difficult reliably predict result DBS therapy patient suffer severe , debilitate tremor . In attempt gain knowledge , electromagnetic tracking system use precisely measure position patient 's upper extremity space routine neurologic examination . The goal use tool quantitatively identify various component severe tremor , discriminate base oscillatory frequency regularity tremor amplitude . The purpose research study well understand nature complex , severe tremor carefully measure movement upper extremity sensor simple task . The goal break complicate tremor component determine component respond deep brain stimulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As participant research study small sensor connect wire affixed point hand , wrist , elbow and/or shoulder . These sensor painless otherwise noninvasive . They use measure precise location hand arm space neurologic examination . This exam test tremor short , simple task use hand arm . This information store along name medical record number analysis test complete . The sensor use measure movement connect thin , flexible wire attach adhesive tape . The motion sensor use magnet produce weak electromagnetic field . This electromagnetic field pose direct harm , could potentially interfere medical device cardiac pacemaker deep brain stimulators place close electromagnetic emitter .</detailed_description>
