	<brief_title>Modulation STAT3 Signaling With Siltuximab Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single center , non-randomized ( patient assign chance treatment group ) , Mechanistic Study ( study focus biologic activity drug , rather disease treatment ) . Up 10 patient Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) enrol study . Participants receive single dose siltuximab blood sample obtain total 6 time 12 week dose . Cells isolate blood sample use measure specific activity cell immune system . Safety evaluation adverse event , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , physical examination perform throughout study . The end study date last assessment last patient .</detailed_description>
