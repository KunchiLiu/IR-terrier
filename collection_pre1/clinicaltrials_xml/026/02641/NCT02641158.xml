	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : This study evaluate effectiveness HCV Care Facilitation intervention move HIV/HCV co-infected substance user forward along HCV care continuum ( compare Control group ) . Primary Hypothesis : The number step achieve along HCV care continuum differ two study group 14-month follow-up period . Secondary Objectives : Component 1 ( Long-term CTN 0049 follow-up ) : Using CTN 0064 baseline data ( self-report , medical record abstraction biological data ) , follow CTN 0049 primary secondary outcome participant consent CTN 0064 protocol re-analyzed evaluate latent and/or endure effect CTN 0049 intervention : 1 . HIV virological suppression 2 . HIV primary care visit attendance 3 . All-cause mortality</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The CTN 0064 study leverage exist research infrastructure cohort CTN 0049 ( NCT01612169 ) randomize , control trial ( RCT ) . CTN 0049 ( `` Project HOPE -- Hospital Visit Opportunity Prevention Engagement HIV-Infected Drug Users '' ) three-group RCT evaluate effective strategy achieve HIV virologic suppression among HIV-infected substance user recruit hospital setting . Between July 2012 January 2014 , total 801 HIV-infected hospitalized patient recruit 11 participate site throughout U.S. randomize one follow three group : 1 ) Patient Navigator intervention , 2 ) Patient Navigator plus Contingency Management intervention , 3 ) Treatment Usual . All CTN 0049 participant provide informed consent complete baseline computer assist personal interview CAPI ( computer assist personal interview : focusing drug use , mental health , demographic socio-economic factor , HIV care drug treatment history ) blood draw ( HIV viral load CD4 count ) . The two intervention group receive 11 patient navigation session 6-month period actively assist participant link HIV primary care substance use treatment . Participants three group complete follow-up assessment consist CAPI , blood draw , urine collection breath analysis approximately 6 12 month post-randomization . Medical record review document receipt HIV care treatment study period . CTN 0064 leverage CTN 0049 research infrastructure cohort utilize 11 participate CTN 0049 research team recruit randomized participant CTN 0064 study . CTN 0064 two main component : Component 1 baseline assessment CTN 0064 . It also serve long-term follow-up assessment CTN 0049 consent participate CTN 0064 . Participants whose HCV antibody test result positive baseline assessment invite enroll Component 2 . Component 2 RCT ass effectiveness Care Facilitation intervention ( compare Control ) move HIV/HCV co-infected substance user forward along HCV care continuum . The study 's primary objective base Component 2 operationalized movement series ( potentially non-sequential ) pre-defined , clinical step along HCV care continuum ( include ultimate step , sustain virologic response treatment 12 week post treatment completion [ SVR12 ] ) ( AASLD/IDSA/IAS-USA ) . Secondary objective ass : 1 ) success step HCV care continuum , 2 ) engagement HIV care substance use treatment , 3 ) HIV viral suppression well 4 ) examine long-term outcome CTN 0049 cohort . All adult randomize CTN 0049 study provide consent contact future study ( hereafter , refer `` CTN 0049 cohort '' ) invite enroll CTN 0064 study . All participant provide informed consent complete Component 1 , consist : 1 ) computer assist personal interview CAPI ( capture history HIV care , HCV test care , substance use substance use treatment ; mental health ; demographic ; socio-economic factor ) , 2 ) HCV antibody screen via rapid HCV test ( , HCV antibody positive , HCV RNA test via venipuncture ) , 3 ) associate pre-/post-HCV test information counseling , 4 ) blood specimen collection via venipuncture , 5 ) drug/alcohol toxicology screening ( via urine evaluation ) . The blood specimens participant assess HIV viral load CD4 count . The blood specimen subset participant screen HCV antibody positive assess HCV RNA determine HCV infection active . Participants screen HCV antibody positive randomize Component 2 assign one two group : 1 ) HCV Care Facilitation intervention 2 ) Control . The Care Facilitation intervention group receive 12 session 6-month intervention period . Follow-up visit group conduct approximately 6 12 month post-randomization . These visit consist CAPI , blood specimen collection , drug/alcohol toxicology screen . Medical record review document HCV testing , receipt use HCV clinical evaluation , care treatment ( applicable ) ; HIV care treatment study period .</detailed_description>
