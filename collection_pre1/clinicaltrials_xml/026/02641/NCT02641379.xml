	<criteria>Male female patient chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 ( 1a 1b ) genotype 4 Age 18 70 year Serologic evidence chronic hepatitis C infection antiHCV antibody test Present least one elevate serum alanineaminotransferase ( ALT ) level high normal last 6 month therapy start include screen period Positive HCVRNA level serum Laboratory parameter ( within 35 day prior study start ) : Hepatitis A anti IgM negativity , HIVAb negativity , HBsAg negativity , Hemoglobin value &gt; 12 g/dl woman &gt; 13 g/dl men , Leukocyte count ( WBC ) &gt; 3 000 /mcl , Platelets count &gt; 100 000/mcl , Creatinine 1.5 time higher normal , normal TSH , normal uric acid maximum tolerance 15 % patient without history gout Liver biopsy finding within 6 month prior study therapy consistent diagnosis chronic hepatitis C infection without compensated cirrhosis . Biopsies older 1 year eligible direct communication principal investigator Negative urine blood pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) document within 24hour period prior first dose study drug . If laboratory report exist , physician make entry medical history pregnancy test negative . All fertile female receive ribavirin must use two form effective contraception treatment 6 month treatment end . All fertile men female partner must use two form effective contraception treatment 7 month treatment end . Written inform consent obtain Any IFN / Pegylated IFN ribavirin therapy previous time Class B C cirrhosis cod Child Pugh classification Women ongoing pregnancy breast feed Therapy systemic antineoplastic immunomodulatory treatment ( include supraphysiologic dos steroid radiation ) 6 month prior first dose study drug Any investigational drug 6 week prior first dose study drug Drug addiction within 1 year prior study start ( patient participate official methadone program eligible ) Diabetes mellitus patient receive insulin therapy Hemophiliac patient ( due increase risk request liver biopsy ) History evidence medical condition associate chronic liver disease HCV ( e.g. , hemochromatosis , autoimmune hepatitis , metabolic liver disease , alcoholic liver disease , toxin exposure ) History evidence bleed esophageal varix condition consistent decompensated liver disease History severe psychiatric disease , especially depression . Severe psychiatric disease define treatment antidepressant medication major tranquilizer therapeutic dos major depression psychosis , respectively , least 3 month previous time history follow : suicidal attempt , hospitalization psychiatric disease , period disability due psychiatric disease . Exception : current psychiatric report certifies contraindication interferon therapy , patient may include History immunologically mediate disease ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , lupus erythematosus , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , scleroderma , severe psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis etc . ) History evidence chronic pulmonary disease associate functional limitation History severe seizure disorder current anticonvulsant use History severe cardiac disease severe coronary heart disease within last 6 month ( angina pectoris , congestive heart failure , recent myocardial infarction , severe hypertension significant arrhythmia ) . If clinical suspicion coronary heart disease cardiologic workup patient prior study entry recommend . History thyroid disease poorly control prescribed medication , elevate thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) concentration elevation antibody thyroid peroxidase clinical manifestation thyroid disease History evidence severe illness , malignancy condition would make patient , opinion investigator , unsuitable study History major organ transplantation exist functional graft Evidence severe retinopathy ( e.g . CMV retinitis , macula degeneration ) Inability unwillingness provide inform consent abide requirement study Additional exclusion criterion concern ribavirin : Male partner woman pregnant Any patient increase baseline risk anemia ( e.g . thalassemia , spherocytosis , history GI bleeding , etc ) anemia would medically problematic Patients document presumed coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease enrol , judgment investigator , acute decrease hemoglobin 4 g/dL would welltolerated</criteria>
