	<brief_summary>Approximately 20 million Americans suffer Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) create risk major health problem , include dementia , heart attack , stroke . Obesity , grow problem Americans Veterans alike , great risk factor development OSA . Male gender smoking , OSA risk factor , common Veterans . Given high comorbidity risk factor Veterans , OSA present significant health burden Veterans . The investigator ' prior work provide evidence OSA occur 69 % Vietnam-era Veterans PTSD . OSA easily treat ; however , 15-30 % OSA patient non-compliant continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , standard OSA treatment . The propose research aim facilitate adherence CPAP treatment test novel cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention Veterans PTSD . If successful , may represent approach could apply rehabilitation chronic condition similar barrier care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Increase CPAP Adherence Veterans With PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GOALS AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH The purpose proposal test novel cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) intervention increase continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment adherence PTSD Veterans new diagnosis obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . PTSD common , debilitate psychiatric consequence exposure trauma source significant disability among U.S. war Veterans . The large epidemiologic study PTSD Vietnam Veterans estimate 15 % Vietnam Veterans suffer PTSD [ 3 ] . The investigator ' research OSA Vietnam era Veterans find 69 % Veterans sample Apnea-Hypopnea Index ( AHI ) 10 [ 4 ] . OSA likely present 50 % middle-aged old VA patient [ 4 , 5 ] . The recurrent hypoxemia sleep fragmentation associate OSA lead neural injury functional impairment . Efficacious treatment available OSA ( e.g. , CPAP ) ; however , Veterans OSA frequently fail use [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] , leave Veterans risk cognitive dysfunction [ 8 ] , deterioration physical health [ 9 ] , negative functional outcome [ 10 ] . The investigator ' long-term goal improve Veterans ' functional outcome improve adherence CPAP . If intervention prove successful , may represent approach could apply rehabilitation chronic condition similar barrier care . RESEARCH DESIGN AND STRATEGY The reason low CPAP adherence include barrier related discomfort use CPAP psychological barrier behavior change [ 11 ] . A CBT treatment improve CPAP adherence , CBT-OSA , successfully apply civilian randomize control trial ( RCTs ) [ 12 , 13 ] . The propose VA intervention would involve delivery CBT-OSA PTSD Veterans foster long-term CPAP adherence . The CBT-OSA treatment would build VISN 21 MIRECC 's expertise CBT intervention [ e.g. , VA rollout CBT-Insomnia ] well investigator ' current research PTSD Veterans OSA . In sample , vast majority diagnose OSA prior study entry ; however , 69 % participant AHI 10 [ 4 ] . Of Veterans previously diagnose OSA , 63 % use CPAP . Thus , CPAP adherence treatment PTSD Veterans next logical step investigator ' research . Specifically , investigator propose 1-year parallel-group RCT involve 120 PTSD Veterans first diagnosis OSA . All participant receive treatment usual VA Pulmonary Service . Participants active arm receive CBT-OSA train Clinical Psychologist . The arm receive individual Respiratory Therapy ( RT ) care , CBT-OSA . Participants arm receive weekly , individual session first 4 week CPAP treatment 3 booster session 1-year protocol . These two arm refer hereafter CBT-OSA RT-only group . HYPOTHESES Hypothesis 1 . ( Primary ) Effect CBT CPAP usage . The investigator hypothesize CBT-OSA group use CPAP hour per night average RT-only group . ANCOVA use test group difference time hour `` mask-on '' CPAP usage per night . [ Primary endpoint : mean Days 335-365 . ] Hypothesis 2 . ( Secondary ) Effect CBT Self-reported Everyday Activities , Mood Quality Life . The investigator hypothesize initiate CPAP treatment , Veterans CBT-OSA group report improvement ease perform everyday activity compare report RT-only group . ANCOVA use test group difference time total score Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire ( FOSQ ; [ 14 ] , Days 0 , 21 , 365 ( endpoint ) . Hypothesis 3 . ( Secondary ) Effect CBT Cognitive Outcomes . The investigator hypothesize CBT-OSA group well cognitive outcome RT-only group time . ANCOVA apply Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test , Delayed Recall Score primary endpoint Day 365 . Hypothesis 4 . ( Secondary ) Effect CBT PTSD . The investigator hypothesize CBT-OSA group few PTSD symptom RT-only group time . ANCOVA use test group difference time total score PTSD Checklist DSM-5 ( PCL-5 ) , measure Days 0 , 21 , 365 . Primary endpoint Day 365 . Exploratory Supplementary Analyses . ( Secondary ) : Individual Differences Response ( Moderators ) . Severity OSA , initial self-efficacy , covariates ( measure pre-treatment Screening Visit ) examine exploratory , hypothesis-generating analysis determine `` '' CBT-OSA work best . Mechanisms Action ( Mediators ) . Because CBT-OSA designed increase self-efficacy CPAP adherence , investigator aim show effect CBT-OSA CPAP usage mediate change self-rated Self-Efficacy Measure Sleep Apnea ( SEMSA ) [ 15 ] , measure Days 0 , 21 , 365 . HOW THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ADDRESS LONGER-TERM GOALS This research fit VA 's goal reduce functional disability PTSD Veterans chronic medical condition . It design determine benefit intervention overall , also determine Veterans CBT-OSA work best . The dataset collect enable researcher troubleshoot intervention propose improved intervention .</detailed_description>
