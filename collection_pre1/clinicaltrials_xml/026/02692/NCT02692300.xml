	<brief_title>EEG Guidance Anesthesia ( ENGAGES-CANADA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ENGAGES CANADA parallel study ENGAGES study currently underway USA . Due difference practice model type anesthesia principle , ENGAGES CANADA important study . Delirium relatively common postoperative complication geriatric population , affect 20 % 70 % surgical patient age 60 . Delirium manifest confusion , inattention inability think logically , may affect patient 's postoperative healing rehabilitation . It associate persistent cognitive decline , long hospital stay , increase incidence injurious fall , increase mortality . Patients undergo major cardiac surgery significant risk postoperative delirium . To date , proven method prevent postoperative delirium patient population often delirious event remain unrecognized . Randomized controlled study diverse surgical patient population suggest intraoperative electroencephalography ( EEG ) guidance general anesthesia may decrease postoperative delirium adverse postoperative outcome . Patients experience postoperative delirium report persistently decrease quality life risk factor incident psychiatric disorder psychotropic medication use . One potential key mechanism relationship delirium incident psychiatric illness may experience dissociation ( disturbed awareness , impaired memory , alter perception ) perioperative period delirious . The co-occurrence psychiatric illness delirium put old adult great risk negative long term effect functional decline . This study compare effectiveness two anesthetic protocol reduce postoperative delirium postoperative health-related quality life high risk population.We expect EEG-guided anesthetic management patient operative procedure result improve health-related outcome , specifically decrease incidence postoperative delirium improve postoperative mental physical health outcome . The publication ENGAGES CANADA include predefined meta-analysis ENGAGES-US .</detailed_description>
