	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial Indomethacin Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : AP inflammatory disease highly variable clinical course potentially lethal . This disease currently lead cause gastrointestinal-related hospital admission United States continue rise incidence . The inciting event lead development AP premature activation digestive pro-enzyme trypsinogen trypsin within pancreatic acinar cell , result pancreatic auto-digestion inflammation . Inflammation localize gland subsequently progress systemic inflammatory response affect distant organ . Studies reveal key role phospholipase A2 propagate inflammatory response induce production inflammatory mediator , include arachidonic acid metabolite . Elevated level phospholipase A2 find serum patient AP develop severe complication , include pancreatic necrosis , shock , OF . The vitro inhibition phospholipase A2 use NSAIDs evaluate potential treatment strategy AP , indomethacin show potent inhibitor among 17 test agent . NSAIDs also inhibit interaction neutrophil endothelial cell , thus prevent accumulation neutrophil site injury . In animal model AP , NSAIDs show attenuate AP severity improve survival . Most human study , however , primarily assess role NSAIDs PEP prophylaxis . A meta-analysis 4 randomize , control study evaluate effect reveal protective role medication , recent multicenter , randomize control trial find administrate rectal indomethacin patient increase risk PEP significantly reduce incidence severity pancreatitis . In 1985 , small randomize control trial ( n=30 ) rectal indomethacin patient AP report significant decrease duration pain . This study date evaluate NSAIDs follow onset AP evaluate systemic inflammation . The effect rectal indomethacin mitigate disease progression patient risk develop severe disease thus remain evaluated . SIRS simple clinical score , range 0-4 , utilizes objective , routine clinical parameter ( body temperature , heart rate , respiratory rate arterial carbon dioxide tension white blood count ) directly reflect underlie inflammatory response . The persistence SIRS , define presence SIRS score ≥2 48 hr follow presentation , show significantly associate development OF , pancreatic necrosis death patient AP . Additionally , serum level CRP 48 hour follow admission also closely correlated development OF . Objective : Our propose randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot trial seek evaluate efficacy rectal indomethacin abrogate systemic inflammation patient acute pancreatitis ( AP ) systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) . Specific Aims : Our long-term goal alter clinical course AP patient high risk development organ failure ( OF ) death . The objective randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot trial evaluate efficacy rectal indomethacin attenuate systemic inflammation patient AP also SIRS . The investigator hypothesize treatment patient AP SIRS therapeutic dos rectal indomethacin mitigate inflammatory response inhibition inflammatory mediator . The investigator also test hypothesis enrol 42 patient randomize receive either rectal indomethacin placebo 48 hour pursue follow specific aim : Aim 1 . Evaluate effect rectal indomethacin systemic inflammation measure change mean SIRS score serum CRP level follow 48hrs treatment patient AP SIRS ; Aim 2 . Evaluate impact rectal indomethacin development OF mortality . Significance : The propose study thus first attempt evaluate therapeutic role NSAIDs patient AP SIRS high risk development OF effective pharmacological therapy currently available . Pilot data generate serve platform large scale study validate efficacy indomethacin treatment AP .</detailed_description>
