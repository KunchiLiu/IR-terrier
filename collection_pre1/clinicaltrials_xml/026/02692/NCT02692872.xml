	<brief_summary>Background : Alpha thalassemia blood disorder . It cause genetic deletion . Part DNA miss group gene call alpha globin . Alpha thalassemias common genetic deletion . We test alpha thalassemia trait . Alpha thalassemia trait someone two normal four alpha globin gene . In people , lead symptom . Others change lead disease , include mild anemia . Researchers want learn alpha thalassemia blood vessel . This may allow develop new treatment blood disease sickle cell disease . Objective : To good understand alpha globin deletion healthy people affect blood vessel . Eligibility : Healthy volunteer age 18 40 self-report African ancestry . Design : Participants provide one-time saliva sample . This mail , in-person study event , NIH . Participants get small kit collect saliva sample . The kit easy instruction . The sample need put refrigerator . Participants spit small amount saliva ( less half teaspoon ) collection tube . Participants close funnel lid tightly , unscrew funnel lid tube . They close tube tightly small cap provide shake tube 5 second . Participants place tube provide envelope mail NIH . The specimen store processed lab . Participants may invite participate research study , whether researcher find alpha thalassemia trait .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many complication sickle cell disease , stroke , kidney damage , skin ulceration , pulmonary hypertension , cardiac hypertrophy prevent , delay reduce inheritance one deletion alpha globin gene . Our long-term research goal understand deletion alpha globin protect vascular complication sickle cell disease . Deletions alpha globin common find approximately 5 % world population.They especially common among Africans people African ancestry , well India , China , Pacific Islands , prevalence range 5 - 80 % . A single deletion little effect red blood cell , two deletion give rise alpha thalassemia , mild microcytic anemia . Patients sickle cell disease two alpha globin deletion tend high hemoglobin level , small red blood cell , low fraction circulate reticulocyte consistent decreased hemolysis red cell turnover . They also lower number dense irreversibly sickled cell . These change might explain alpha globin deletion reduce severity sickle cell disease . However , novel function alpha globin regulator endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) recently identify raise new question alpha globin deletion protect sickle cell disease . We hypothesize individual two alpha globin deletion decrease gene expression protein level alpha globin vascular endothelium , permit NO diffuse across myoendothelial junction , compare individual four alpha globin gene intact . In protocol screen healthy volunteer identify two alpha globin deletion ; individual well match control refer separate protocol undergo study vascular endothelial function .</detailed_description>
