	<brief_summary>Babies bear preterm ( complete 37 week womb ) increase risk long-term disability death . The investigator fully understand cause ( ) preterm birth occur frequently normal , healthy bacteria ( call Lactobacilli ) woman 's birth canal replace unhealthy bacteria . Previous attempt get rid unhealthy bacteria antibiotic show affect risk preterm birth . The reason may require replacement Lactobacilli birth canal . This do ask woman take capsule contain lactobacilli daily . To study whether oral Lactobacilli capsule compare dummy capsule reduce risk preterm birth , large study involve approximately 10,000 woman would require . But investigator know whether woman would agree take part complete study , investigator wish study small , initial study describe . The result study show whether probiotic produce desired biological effect vaginal bacteria , whether would feasible perform large , definitive study effectiveness prevention preterm birth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preterm birth ( PTB ) define birth baby completion 37 week gestation womb . It major cause infant mortality particularly first month life . Approximately 75 per cent baby die first 28 day life bear 37 week gestation . Survivors PTB increase risk long-term disability cerebral palsy , sight hear impairment , learn behavioural problem , epilepsy , hospital readmission . Even late preterm birth , define PTB 34 -- 36 week gestation , account 70 % preterm birth England Wales , increase risk death disability compare baby bear term . Although prevalence adverse long -- term outcome high among child bear early gestational age , much high number birth 34 -- 36 week gestation compare earlier gestation mean group child make major contribution number child adversely affect . PTB consequence negative emotional psychosocial impact parent family . In addition impact individual family , financial consequence public sector care child bear preterm significant . The cost care age 18 child born preterm estimate exceed £3 billion per year England Wales 2006 price . It estimate hypothetical intervention delay PTB 1 week across gestational age category would reduce public sector cost PTB £1 billion annually . About one third PTBs occur early delivery indicate due complication mother unborn baby ( fetus ) ; remain two third occur spontaneously . The rate PTB increase 19 % 1990 2010 developed country . At time , mark improvement survival rate PTBs similar reduction adverse outcomes see . Thus , absolute number individual adversely affect increase . Infection within womb ( intrauterine infection ) strongly associate spontaneous PTB . The common pathway intrauterine infection ascent unhealthy bacteria vagina cervix womb . Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) , normally dominant healthy bacteria vagina ( lactobacillus ) replace unhealthy bacteria , strongly associate PTB . Lactobacilli , principally strain produce high level chemical hydrogen peroxide , appear protect BV reduce risk PTB . Despite substantial evidence link BV PTB , result trial antibiotic treatment BV pregnancy produce clear evidence benefit . The reason might eradication unhealthy bacteria require rather replacement unhealthy bacteria normally dominant lactobacillus . One way achieve could administer lactobacilli-containing capsule ( probiotic ) pregnant woman . Oral probiotic take pregnancy may directly alter vaginal bacteria protect cervical opening ascend infection . The investigator formally review medical literature use probiotic prevent PTB . There evidence medical trial suggest probiotic take pregnancy reduce risk PTB trial either small poor quality result conclusive . The result observational study nearly 19,000 pregnant woman suggest probiotic- containing food reduce risk spontaneous PTB . The best way determine whether probiotic reduce risk PTB perform type study call double-blind , randomise control trial ( RCT ) . In trial , participant allocate receive either probiotic supplement dummy ( placebo ) supplement . The allocation particular supplement purely chance ( random ) neither participants researcher know allocation participant end trial ( double-blind ) . Then , look difference rate PTB group would possible say whether probiotic reduce rate PTB . The investigator estimate RCT could detect useful difference rate PTB two group would require participation approximately 10,000 woman cost several million pound . Given approximately 20,000 delivery occur annually inner North East London alone , sufficient woman region would eligible participation RCT . However , willingness woman participate complete trial unknown . A small , pilot trial require determine proportion pregnant woman would participate probiotic PTB trial proportion would complete study . The proposal , PrePro trial , design gather data inform feasibility , plan execution large RCT look effect probiotic PTB . Potential risk benefit probiotic The World Health Organisation define probiotic live micro-organisms confer health benefit host administer adequate amount . They displace kill pathogen , modulate immune response interfere inflammatory cascade cause preterm labour . Administration probiotic mouth intravaginally safe effective reduce incidence treat urogenital infection . There evidence adverse consequence mother infant result probiotic exposure pregnancy . Acceptability compliance daily ingestion probiotic placebo week mid-pregnancy find high . The particular probiotic strain propose study show acceptable safe pregnant woman , colonise vagina within 4 week commence oral intake . A large intervention trial ingest oral capsule early pregnancy end gestation perform UK . For trial successful , essential gather data inform feasibility , plan execution . PrePro design provide data . This trial conduct compliance study protocol , relevant regulation , MRC Guidelines Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) .</detailed_description>
