	<brief_summary>Background : The body use energy calorie basic function like breathe digest food . Over time , person eats calorie burn , may become overweight obese . Obesity major health concern . Researchers want look fat muscle tissue learn metabolism . That body use food nutrient normal function energy . This research may help develop new treatment obesity relate disease . Objective : To learn role fat muscle metabolism , particularly fat muscle store use energy . Eligibility : Adults 18 year old plan surgery NIH tissue collect surgeon . Design : Participants screen regular NIH doctor . Then researcher contact study . Participants make extra visit NIH study . Researchers collect sample participant surgery . These fat tissue skeletal muscle tissue . Muscle tissue take tissue go discard . Collecting tissue add time extra incision require surgery . After surgery , blood drawn . Some participant do pre-op post-op room . Others do hospital stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More ever , people eat calorie food burn exercise activity , imbalance cause rise rate obesity diabetes US throughout world . The different type body fat central player process . The white fat store excess calorie come food , brown fat also know brown adipose tissue , BAT consume energy food generate heat . This important process BAT achieve action special protein find BAT , call uncoupling protein 1 ( UCP1 ) . Scientists use believe BAT important small animal human infant , recently discover u others response mild cold exposure , adult human BAT ( hBAT ) consume glucose weight tissue . In addition , human BAT may also combat weight gain become active setting increase food consumption . This phenomenon already demonstrate mouse rat , presence suggest activation human BAT could use safe treatment obesity metabolic disease . Finally , emerge evidence indicate human BAT may endocrine organ , mean release hormone blood regulates organ body well , include skeletal muscle , liver , insulin-releasing pancreatic Beta-cell . If go understand hBAT function body physiology use calorie-burning ability treat illness metabolism diabetes , need approach challenge use several different method . One key reason BAT easy find body , cell make different depend body need . Brown fat compose least two known type distinct cell , term constitutive /brown inducible /beige ; also white fat cell vary proportion . Given currently know way estimate amount brown fat body simple blood test , lab group successfully rely collect small amount fat site surgery patient already undergo clinically indicate procedure . Information obtain fat tissue address question relate ( ) brown fat cell develop immature stem cell ; ( b ) gene active ; ( c ) many calorie brown fat burn . These early study also provide preliminary cell necessary establish long-lasting human brown white cell grow indefinitely laboratory . Despite progress , much remain unknown functional difference brown beige fat cell could affect metabolism human different age , sex , genetic background , well change see brown fat cell different illness . The goal study address related question .</detailed_description>
