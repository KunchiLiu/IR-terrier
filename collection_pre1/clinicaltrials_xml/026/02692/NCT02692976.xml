	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer type cancer conventional dendritic cell ( DC ) treatment beneficial effect overall survival . In study investigator aim show immunologic efficacy tumor-peptide loaded natural DC metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patient ( mCRPC ) . The immunomonitoring include : 1. functional response tetramer analysis delayed-type hypersensitivity infiltrate lymphocyte tumor peptide 2. type I interferon ( IFN ) gene expression peripheral blood mononuclear cell , 3. proliferative , effector cytokine- humoral response keyhole limpet hemocyanin , immunogenic protein provide T cell help . The secondary objective safety feasibility natural DC vaccination , influence quality life treatment natural DC , clinical efficacy treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Immunotherapy DC vaccine Prevention infectious disease immunization one great achievement modern medicine . Nonetheless , considerable challenge remain improve efficacy exist vaccine therapeutic immunization diseases cancer . More 10 year ago first group introduce tumor antigen-loaded DC-based vaccine clinic . Effective immune response favorable clinical outcome indeed observe . Thus far , mainly conventional vitro generate monocyte-derived DCs ( moDC ) use clinical trial worldwide . Long lasting tumor specific T cell-mediated immunological response clearly link increase progression free survival well overall survival . However , moDC may optimal source DCs DC vaccination study , due extensive culture period compound require obtain mature moDC . Two principal subset human blood DC , call plasmacytoid DC ( pDC ) myeloid DC ( mDC ) , possibly well alternative since require extensive culture period directly isolable peripheral-blood . Based promising immunological clinical outcome pDC mDC vaccination metastatic melanoma patient , test blood DC subset warrant . Based observation investigator convince pDC mDC employ different , probably optimal mechanism combat cancer . In addition , base vitro data preclinical study suggest natural DC act synergistically , investigator hypothesize combination pDC mDC may induce strong anti-tumor immune response compare pDC mDC alone . Immunotherapy prostate cancer Prostate cancer common noncutaneous cancer men . In recent year novel therapy study extensively . Prostate cancer usually diagnose men 65 year age . Depending severity disease , current treatment option prostate cancer consist active surveillance , prostatectomy , radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy . Up one-third patient localized tumor eventually fail local therapy progress advanced-stage metastatic disease within 10 year . Although majority patient initially respond anti-androgens , tumor become resistant within 14 30 month . For men mCRPC median survival phase III study range 15 19 month . The chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel several year treatment option mCRPC , result median overall survival benefit two three month compare mitoxantrone . In past five year second-line chemotherapy ( cabazitaxel ) , second-generation androgen deprivation therapy ( abiraterone acetate plus prednisone enzalutamide ) , cellular immunotherapy ( sipuleucel-T ) , target alpha emitter ( radium-223 treatment ) expand treatment repertoire mCRPC . Sipuleucel-T , DC-based vaccine patient suffer prostate cancer , show clinically effective approve Food Drug Administration European Medicines Agency mCRPC patient . A major advantage cellular immunotherapy compare chemotherapy , even androgen deprivation therapy , low toxicity . Several immunotherapeutic approach investigated potential tumor antigen identify . Prostvac ( vaccinia-prostate-specific antigen ) administer randomized phase II study encourage result . Ipilimumab promising result several phase II study combination vaccine , GVAX . However , phase III study post-chemotherapy trial ipilimumab seem superior placebo . Hence , sipuleucel-T clinical significant result clinical trial . The promising immunological clinical outcome pDC mDC metastatic melanoma warrant test blood DC prostate cancer . In study investigator aim show proof-of-principle natural DC immunogenicity prostate cancer patient : induction/enhancement tumor-specific T cell mDC induction IFN signature pDC . Investigators also get insight combine subset improve immunogenicity clinical outcome . Hence , urgent need potent treatment modality together solid predictive prognostic biomarker .</detailed_description>
