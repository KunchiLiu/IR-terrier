	<detailed_description>Patients pre-operative renal dysfunction increase risk develop cardiac surgery associate acute kidney injury ( AKI ) proportion patient normal kidney function also affect . Studies show patient develop AKI post cardiac surgery poorer long term prognosis , even kidney function subsequently return normal However , cause currently understand . We postulate unifying mechanism make patient susceptible develop post-operative AKI overall bad long term prognosis . We suggest mechanism reduce regenerative capacity tissue . To test hypothesis measure several marker cell senescence age include telomere length , telomerase activity , DNA methylation status . Previous animal study show reduce telomere length telomerase activity mouse increase susceptibility ischaemia induce renal injury . The current study look whether similar association see human , use cardiopulmonary bypass mechanism study ischaemia/inflammatory induce kidney injury . It aim answer primary research question : Are telomere length telomerase activity relate development acute kidney injury follow cardiac surgery ? The presence association would provide new avenue development biomarkers predict outcomes follow cardiac surgery . In addition scoring tool currently clinical practice , biomarkers might allow good risk stratification patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Patient Registry sample storage : Tissue sample patient data collect patient also form part Barts Cardiovascular Registry ( BAR ) . This Biobank facility run Barts Heart Centre collaboration United Kingdom ( UK ) Biobank . All aspect patient recruitment , data collection , data storage , data analysis cover Standard Operating Procedures ensure data quality registry . Quality assurance : The management team BAR responsible audit completeness validity data . Sample size : As precede data possible association telomere biology AKI post-cardiac surgery unable perform power calculation sample size . In effect , present study large pilot study look association . Previously report study give incidence AKI follow cardiac surgery 15 25 % . In order approximately 200 AKI patient study , aim recruit 1000 patient . This realistic give Barts Heart Centre perform approximately 50 cardiac operation per week . Once recruitment establish , interim analysis perform allow accurate estimation sample size . Statistical analysis : All relevant clinical parameter analyse frequency , tabulation , correlation , distribution normality comparison accordingly . An array statistical method employ parametric non-parametric data include Multivariate factor associate development acute kidney injury follow cardiac surgery . Receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis use investigate clinical outcome new marker cell senescence ( telomere length , telomerase activity , DNA methylation status ) . Missing data value rectify possible review primary medical record . Missing data value due incomplete sample collection deal statistical modelling .</detailed_description>
