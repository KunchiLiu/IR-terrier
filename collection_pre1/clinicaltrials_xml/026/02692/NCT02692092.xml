	<detailed_description>HealthEast Care System begin first community-based joint replacement registry ( HJRR ) U.S. 1991 , database allow track implant use failure rate among 90 orthopaedic surgeon perform arthroplasty surgery great metropolitan area St. Paul , MN . Initially conceive part process well manage cost determine implant cost-efficient , become apparent registry would allow insight process proven value Scandinavian joint registry . With knowledge majority total joint arthroplasty U.S. perform relatively low-volume community surgeon , HJRR remain uniquely position reflect contemporary U.S. surgical practice . The purpose HJRR maintain improve care individual undergo joint replacement surgery provide timely information surgeon broader orthopaedic community . With primary outcome measure time revision surgery , combine analysis confound factor mortality monitoring , HJRR provide realistic measure success give arthroplasty procedure community . In addition , registry evaluate relative effectiveness different prosthetic design , identify patient variable may impact implant survival , provide track mechanism necessary event implant recall . Over 20 year existence , HJRR refine data-gathering , data verification , data analysis utilizes process design require direct surgeon involvement data input . Volunteer surgeon review revision chart operative note carefully delineate reason revision . The HJRR capture process validate 94 % revision surgery perform within HJRR . The database use generate information practical use surgeon , demonstrate influence surgeon behavior . Among example , HJRR report failure rate associate unicompartmental knee arthroplasty , hybrid cementless total knee arthroplasty , metal-on-metal total hip design lead significant decline respective use period document . Similarly , HJRR allow rapid notification surgeon expedite patient care three significant hip implant recall last decade . As move third decade , HJRR proud influential role development national American Joint Replacement Registry ( AJRR ) one early participant pilot hospital . It remain important contributor large national effort , particularly certain data subset may outside scope much large AJRR . The HJRR core workgroup publish widely find last two decade , look forward future compel example worthwhile information advancement orthopaedic science make community setting .</detailed_description>
