	<detailed_description>With dramatic improvement survival patient hypoplastic leave heart syndrome relate form single right ventricle undergo stag palliation Fontan operation , high prevalence neurodevelopment abnormality expose . The NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network ( PHN ) Single Ventricle Reconstruction ( SVR ) III study , `` Long-term Outcomes Children Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome ( HLHS ) Impact Norwood Shunt Type , '' prospective follow-up study exist cohort child HLHS single RV anomaly enrol early infancy randomize clinical trial modify Blalock-Taussig shunt ( MBTS ) versus right ventricular pulmonary artery shunt ( RVPAS ) . The parent SVR III study seek determine shunt assignment time Norwood operation associate cardiac function , transplant-free survival , exercise function , neurodevelopmental outcome . The investigator propose neuroimaging ancillary study parent SVRIII study leverage neurodevelopmental follow-up SVR cohort age 11 year . The investigator combine state-of-the-art brain image technique [ Resting-Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent ( BOLD ) Diffusion Tensor Imaging ] 140 SVR III patient 100 referent subject innovative brain connectome `` graph '' analysis determine brain connectivity graph measurement provide novel neuroimaging biomarkers neurodevelopmental disability improve investigator ' understand incite mechanisms SVR survivor . The investigator ' specific aim : Specific Aim ( SA ) # 1 : To characterize global brain network topology SVR III cohort ; SA # 2 : To determine neurocognitive behavioral outcome predict global brain network topology SVR III cohort . SA # 3 : To determine patient factor ( e.g. , birth weight , gestational age , maternal education ) medical factor ( e.g. , intraoperative conduct Norwood procedure , hemodynamic complication , type number intervention , measure global morbidity ) predict global brain network topology SVRIII cohort . SA # 4 : To precisely characterize specific relationship global brain network topology , specific patient/medical factor , adverse neurocognitive/behavioral outcome SVRIII cohort . The investigator use linear regression mediation statistical method analyze association MRI graph measure SVRIII neurodevelopmental measure surgical/non-surgical clinical independent risk factor . Upon successful completion , study elucidate nature basis neurodevelopmental disability single ventricle patient follow Fontan palliation . This research also contribute novel robust set clinical/research tool form neuroimaging biomarkers use help classify predict outcome complex congenital heart disease ( CHD ) .</detailed_description>
