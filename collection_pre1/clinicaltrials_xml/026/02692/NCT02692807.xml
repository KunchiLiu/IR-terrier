	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine efficacy hip arthroscopic surgery compare sham surgery ( diagnostic arthroscopy ) patient symptomatic radiological finding relate impingement ( FAI ) and/or labral tear use randomize controlled design ( HIPARTI Study : Primary aim main paper : primary end point : iHOT 1 year follow-up ) ) . Our main hypothesis surgical procedure hip demonstrate great efficacy sham surgery ( diagnostic hip arthroscopy ) hip relate quality life ( iHOT-33 ) 1 year ( HIPARTI Study ) . The secondary aim study establish modifiable risk factor associate pain , function , work participation quality life 1 year people age 18-50 year hip impingement and/or labral tear diagnose hip arthroscopy . ( HARP Study : A separate paper publish main aim HARP Study ) Long-term follow-ups HIPARTI Study well HARP Study perform 2 , 5 10 year ( secondary aim separate paper ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter , international , assessor patient blind clinical RCT two group ( primary aim ) . HIPARTI Study The design trial conforms SPIRIT guideline . All patient hip pain eligible hip arthroscopy routine care pathway identify outpatient clinic . Consultant orthopedic surgeon determine patient 's eligibility study ( base inclusion exclusion criterion study ) member team introduce study patient refer research coordinator information . Patients provide oral write information study introduce consent form . If interest continue patient provide information arrangement make baseline appointment assessment consenting . The baseline assessment appointment occur within one month initial approach . At baseline appointment patient meet research coordinator independent research assistant/tester ( physical therapist ) blind tester . Patients return sign informed consent form baseline question complete . Those willing participate RCT ( HIPARTI Study ) , ask interested include prospective longitudinal cohort study include similar baseline follow-up test RCT ( HARP Study separate paper publish ) . All patient HARP Study undergo hip arthroscopy surgery . The Australian site include patient HARP Study , since majority orthopedic surgeon work privately participate HIPARTI Study . Data collection perform electronically HIPARTI HARP Studies enter data approve Checkware system ( www.checkware.no ) . Each collaborate center apply ethical committee Data Inspectorate country/institution . Approval confirm Oslo University Hospital ( HIPARTI ) Australia ( HARP Study ) January 2016 . Randomization ( HIPARTI ) occur prior surgery , final eligibility confirm . Randomizations perform centrally use automate computer generate system . Block randomization stratification center perform . All patient undergo image ( may include CT scan least 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance image MRI ) prior surgical assessment part routine care . All patient also undergo standardized radiograph hip pelvis also part routine care . Plain radiograph examine evidence osteoarthritis joint space narrowing , osteophytes , cysts subchondral hypertrophy . Several radiographic measurement perform among : alpha angle lateral center-edge angle determine presence FAI . Radiographs also part follow-up . Participating orthopedic surgeon ask coordinate waiting list ensure hip arthroscopy patient call surgery accordance study protocol . Ideally , patient complete baseline assessment close randomize treatment possible ( within 1 month ) . In event surgery perform within 1 month baseline assessment , question assessment complete baseline complete . The standard followed-ups 6 month 1 year include primary secondary outcome . One year primary end point randomization code broken accord predefined published statistical protocol ( HIPARTI ) . At follow-ups research coordinator/independent tester attend . At 6 month follow-up independent orthopedic surgeon attend regularly take care patient satisfy . The aim use follow criterion subjective complaint : equal bad 10 point IHOT-33 score compare baseline . All patient withdraw without give reason time ( state consent form patient need sign ) . An unblinded orthopedic surgeon course able access medical record regarding perform procedure time need health patient . All patient ( group RCT ( HIPARTI ) well HARP study ) undergo postoperative rehabilitation program base best available evidence . Each patient treat physical therapist train proficient post-hip arthroscopy rehabilitation . Rehabilitation deliver minimum 8 session 3-months month follow three month . Details rehabilitation outline Appendix Rehabilitation . This contain treatment algorithm guide clinical reason progression treatment ( manual therapy , exercise education ) week 1-12 . Long term follow-up perform 2 , 5 10 year Due lack study publish within field : clinical relevant difference well change within group SD difficult estimate . Our sample size calculation base primary outcome iHOT 33 1 year : estimate effect-size 0.6 power 90 , give 60 group , expect 15 % dropout give 138 patient total . Electronic randomization list generate , estimation inclusion rate per site include . Statistical analysis procedure publish analysis perform prior open group allocation patient include follow 1 year follow-up ( main outcome ) .</detailed_description>
