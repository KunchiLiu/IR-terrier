Myelo001 , small orally bioavailable molecule , show chemotherapy- radiotherapy-induced myelosuppression stimulate differentiation peripheral white blood cell ( WBC ) bone marrow cell leucocytic , lymphocytic , erythrocytic lineage . The purpose MyeloConcept study determine safety effectiveness Myelo001 prevent reduce chemotherapy-induced neutropenia myelosuppression patient receive chemotherapy due breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Phase IIa Study Myelo001 Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase IIa study , 1:1 randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-design , multi-center study . Each breast cancer patient randomly assign one two treatment arm receive either Myelo001 placebo tablet . Investigational medicinal product take supportive care 23 consecutive day chemotherapy treatment . Hematologic safety parameter well actual begin dos follow chemotherapy cycle assess . A single primary variable analyzed test statistic base frequent absolute neutrophil measurement . Additionally , subgroup patient biomarkers pharmacokinetics Myelo001 investigate .</detailed_description>
