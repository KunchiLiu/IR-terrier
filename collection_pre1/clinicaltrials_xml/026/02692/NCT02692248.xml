	<brief_summary>The use highly effective rituximab-containing therapy treating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) make difficult salvage relapse refractory patient . In addition , patient advance age significant comorbidities , consequently candidate high-dose consolidative therapy , poor prognosis . Prospective study investigate new salvage regimens essential . The combination rituximab , gemcitabine oxaliplatin ( R-GEMOX ) effective salvage regimen patient relapse refractory DLBCL , favourable toxicity profile unfit and/or elderly patient . Ibrutinib , oral Bruton 's tyrosine kinase inhibitor , potent killer ABC DLBCL cell line vitro xenograft . It expect combination ibrutinib R-GEMOX-Dexa could effective well tolerate . Thus , propose open-label , non-randomized , multicentre , phase II trial , investigate safety efficacy combination ibrutinib rituximab , gemcitabine , oxaliplatine dexamethasone follow ibrutinib maintenance salvage therapy patient relapse refractory non-GCB DLBCL non-candidates stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
