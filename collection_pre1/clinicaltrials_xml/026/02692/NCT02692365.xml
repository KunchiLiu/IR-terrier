	<brief_summary>This exploratory , national , single-center , open-label study , conduct Institute Education Research Syrian-Lebanese Hospital collaboration Radiology Institute , Heart Institute Faculty Medicine São Paulo , Hospital São Paulo UNIFESP , Departments Physics Mathematics University São Paulo order detect presence calcium flux change , tumor perfusion electrical property tumor tissue expose RF EMF AM Cancer-frequency specific patient advanced HCC correlate finding hemodynamic change assess non-invasive hemodynamic measurement . This study aim demonstrate presence three mechanism ( hypothesis ) could involve hemodynamic change specific antitumor effect induce exposure RF EMF AM cancer-specific frequency . This study intend study therapeutic diagnostic procedure . For reason , consider evolutionary clinical data intervention study .</brief_summary>
