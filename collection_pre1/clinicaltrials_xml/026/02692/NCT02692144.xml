	<brief_summary>This study test hypothesis optimize savory cluster ( Test-cluster ) make proprietary baking process combine slow digestible carbohydrate fiber elicit low postprandial blood glucose insulin response Control-cluster make general processing procedure typical ingredient commonly use commercially available snack bar : oat , peanut , corn syrup . However , since Test-cluster contains ~30 % less available-carbohydrate ( 24g ) Control ( 33g ) , postprandial response elicit Test-cluster also compare portion White-bread match available-carbohydrate content . On 3 separate day , 25 healthy male non-pregnant female age 18-60 yr BMI 20 35 kg/m² fast serum glucose &lt; 7.0mmol/L ( 126 mg/dL ) ask consume 1 serving ( 56g ) Test- Control-cluster 47g White Bread blood glucose insulin measure interval next 4 hr . Each serve Test-cluster Control-cluster contain similar amount total carbohydrate , protein , fat energy content . Each serve Test-cluster White-bread equivalent amount 24g available carbohydrate . On test occasion , subject weigh , 2 fast blood sample obtain finger-prick 5min apart 2nd sample , subject start consume test meal . Subjects ask consume entire test meal within 10 min . At first bite timer start blood sample take glucose analysis 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 240 min start eat . Additional blood take separate vial -5 , 0 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 240 min insulin analysis . Blood sample obtain hand warm electric heating pad 3-5 min prior sample . During 4hr test , participant remain seat quietly . After last blood sample participant offer snack allow leave .</brief_summary>
