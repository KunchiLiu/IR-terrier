	<brief_summary>Administration concomitant antibiotic ( CA ) know risk factor treatment failure treatment CDI , well recurrence CDI . Recent data suggest among patient receive CA , fidaxomicin superior vancomycin . While data encourage , many clinician remain unclear apply data patient care . Additionally , patient exclude trial present FDA expect would require ≥ 7 day CA . Therefore , clinical question still remain apply data real world patient require long course CA develop CDI therapy . We therefore propose open label , comparative prospective study fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily vs oral vancomycin 125 mg four time daily treatment CDI among patient receive long course CA . We hypothesize fidaxomicin superior vancomycin respect clinical cure patient CDI .</brief_summary>
