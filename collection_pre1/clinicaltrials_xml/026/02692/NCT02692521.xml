	<detailed_description>The AAP continue reaffirm recommendation exclusive breast feed 6 month , continuation breastfeed complementary feeding start . Ideally , breastfeed continue first year life . NICUs implement increase use human milk report 80 percent infant receive least human milk discharge . Research show breastfeed rate preterm infant initiation breastfeed discharge far less term infant ( Mastrup , 2014 ) . Yet study continue show ongoing benefit breast milk initiation low birth weight neonates NICU well developmental outcomes 30 month age ( Vohr , Poindexter , Dusick , McKinley , et al. , 2007 ) . A large cohort low birth weight infant study reveal give breast milk early hospitalization continue receive , whether express breast fed , less frequent re-hospitalizations higher Bayley Developmental score emotional regulation 30 month age . Additionally , breast milk volume exposure increase , child improve mental development index total behavioral index improvement well . In CQI survey do three NICU follow clinic , discover 30 percent still breastfeed 1-3 month post discharge . There study investigate factor contribute increase human milk post discharge . Factors study include kangaroo care , quick access pump support , history breast feeding NICU . There study investigate factor contribute increase human milk use post discharge . Callen Pinelli find successful breast feed preterm infant ( mean gestation 28 week ) likely mother pump early continue diligently . In addition early pumping lactation support , kangaroo care , experience breast feeding still NICU associate longer use human milk successful breast feeding discharge . Pineda ( 2011 ) look effect breast-feeding NICU whether first oral suck feed breast preterm infant . Mean gestational age infant put breast 33.1 week + 1.59 week . Though challenging mother , ability continue maintain breast-feeding NICU stay discharge well first fee breast increase overall duration breast-feeding duration discharge . Direct breast-feeding also increase oxytocin level mother , lead psychological benefit improve maternal response improve attachment behavior . These factor may indirectly lead improve use breast milk . This study investigate baby receive human milk , either express breast fed vary time post discharge , explore NICU factor may foster inhibit increase breast milk use NICU graduate .</detailed_description>
