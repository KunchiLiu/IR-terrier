	<brief_summary>The CASCADE-trial two-armed open-label randomize control trial conduct rural Lesotho . Participants test HIV-positive community-based HIV test counsel campaign randomize intervention control arm . Allocation 1:1 parallel assignment . Participants control arm follow standard care community-based HIV test result : They refer near clinic receive baseline laboratory test adherence counseling . After least 2 clinic visit adherence counsel start anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) . After ART-initiation attend monthly follow-up clinic drug refill . Individuals randomize intervention arm propose day community-based ART initiation combine less frequent follow-up visit . The primary outcome linkage care 3 month viral suppression 12 month test HIV-positive community-based HIV test counsel campaign .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A publish version trial protocol download : http : //bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-2972-6 Background In November 2014 Joint United Nations Programme HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) publish 90-90-90 target 2020 ( UNAIDS 2014 ) . The strategy aim massive scale-up coverage antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) among individual infect HIV . Based accumulated evidence viral suppression successful ART reduce risk transmission ( Cohen 2011 ) , expect - achieve - 90-90-90 target would lead reduction yearly global HIV-incidence 2 million currently 500'000 2020 ( Jones 2014 ) . In 2015 two randomize control trial show benefit start ART early possible infect individual - even CD4-cell count threshold 500 cells/mL ( TEMPRANO 2015 ; INSIGHT START 2015 ) , lead World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend anyone infect HIV start ART soon possible diagnosis ( WHO 2015 ) . A `` seek-test-treat '' strategy bear , however , unprecedented challenge setting HIV hyperendemic resource may limit ( Hull 2014 ; Delva 2015 ) . The Continuum Care Cascade ( `` cascade '' ) involve step HIV-infected individual take order achieve viral suppression . It start know one 's HIV status , continue linkage care positive HIV test , initiation ART , uninterrupted continuation ART ( retention care adherence medication ) , end viral suppression ( MacCarthy 2015 ) . Already prior announcement `` seek-test-and-treat '' approach , weaknesses cascade often hamper effectiveness HIV program resource-rich well resource-poor setting ( Yehia 2015 ; Kratzer 2012 ) . In Sub-Saharan Africa care cascade still far 90-90-90 target 29 % infected individual estimate ART virally suppress 2013 . In order achieve UNAIDS target innovative , effective , practical approach improve care cascade thus urgently need ( Mills 2013 ; Piot 2015 ) . Linkage care initial positive HIV test describe `` Achilles ' heel '' care cascade ( Nachega 2014 ) . Most study Sub-Saharan Africa report linkage rate lower 50 % ( Naik 2015 ; Parker 2015 ; Clouse 2013 ; Gerdts 2014 ) . In cluster-randomized trial compare home-based mobile-clinic HIV test counselling ( HTC ) Lesotho , 25 % newly test HIV-positive individual access care within one month test ( Labhardt 2014 ) . Several intervention show improve linkage care , point-of-care CD4 count directly positive HIV test , immediate start cotrimoxazole prophylaxis , incentives food-assistance , extend post-test counsel home-visits , community-workers accompaniment . However , control study test programmatic intervention package improve linkage care still largely lack ( Okeke 2014 ; Govindasamy 2014 ) . Furthermore , must note intervention , patient-accompaniment food support resource intensive may work small NGO-driven project , sustainable large scale ( Posse 2013 ) . In systematic review address barrier linkage care , transport cost distance frequently cite factor patient enrol care positive HIV test ( Govindasamy 2012 ) . Objective trial This CASCADE trial test effectiveness day home-based ART initiation positive HIV test combination reduction frequency follow-up visit clinic pragmatic programmatically feasible approach improve linkage care , retention care , viral suppression . It two-armed open-label randomize controlled trial . Allocation 1:1 parallel assignment . The intervention target individual test HIV-positive community-based HTC . Recruitment participants Participants recruit community-based HTC campaign district Butha-Buthe , northern Lesotho . Home-based HTC campaign conduct anticipated period 3 month begin end February catchment area six health care facility - four nurse-led health center , one missionary one public hospital . Three team consist 4 lay counsellor , supervise one professional counsellor nurse visit household randomly pre-selected area propose HTC household member . If household member test HIV positive HTC campaign eligible CASCADE trial , he/she randomize one two arm .</detailed_description>
