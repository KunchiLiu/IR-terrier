	<brief_summary>Background : The gallbladder small organ liver . Gallbladder cancer lead cause cancer death among woman Chile . Chile also among high rate gallbladder cancer death world . Researchers high-risk region Chile want find type cancer . They especially want know inflammation affect way develops . Objective : To good understand cause gallbladder disease factor may associate . Eligibility : Women age 50 74 gallbladder cancer cover Chilean national health system . Other people age 21 gallbladder disease . Healthy adult age 21 . Design : Participants may screen ultrasound . They may ask question health . Participants ultrasound abdomen . This do study clinic hospital home . The ultrasound use sound wave take picture gallbladder . Participants physical exam . Participants mouths look tooth loss , denture , gum redness . Participants give blood sample saliva sample . Participants ask access medical history . They may ask allow researcher keep sample take gallbladder surgery . Participants answer question medical history . This include illnesses , surgery , medicine use , family history . It also include diet lifestyle habit , place live work . Some participant 3 follow-up visit 6 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gallbladder cancer lead cause cancer death among woman Chile , among high report gallbladder cancer incidence mortality rate world . Gallbladder cancer provide particularly good model understanding role inflammation carcinogenesis since major risk factor , gallstone , cause substantial inflammation gallbladder . Chile also high prevalence obesity , diabetes , metabolic syndrome , increasingly understood inflammatory disorder , extent carcinogenic effect mediate inflammatory pathway unknown . While vast majority gallbladder cancer case gallstone , small fraction gallstone patient ever develop gallbladder cancer . Since way identify small proportion risk , gallstone case cholecystectomized , , give large absolute number individual gallstone , result overtreatment under-treatment others high-risk area like Chile . While cholecystectomy standard treatment symptomatic relief , people need surgery surgeon perform , individual age 34-49 prioritized treatment , regardless symptom . This practice may lead overtreatment among 34-49-year-olds treatment individual age 50 since wait longer surgery . At time , 30 % patient biliary colic attack never another attack , cholecystectomy always lead cessation symptom . In addition , cholecystectomy associate increase risk digestive disease . Thus , cholecystectomy may need gallstone patient may fact increase risk cancer . Better predictor risk clearly need . As cancer , dysplasia important epidemiologic endpoint immediate precursor cancer since vast majority gallbladder cancer develop histologic continuum chronic cholecystitis , pseudopyloric metaplasia , incomplete intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia , cancer . Thus , aim identify risk factor gallbladder dysplasia cancer ( GDC ) Version January 13 , 2016 Koshiol Proposal - 2 potential non-invasive risk stratification method , ultrasound characteristic alone combination inflammatory marker patient characteristic , good understand etiology natural history GDC help inform strategy GDC prevention . Together collaborator Pontifica Universidad Catolica ( PUC ) , successfully complete pilot study Chile previously review approved SAG provide baseline data propose study . Our pilot demonstrate high recruitment rate target enrollment area ( 80 % ) high rate questionnaire completion ( 100 % ) , blood collection ( 78 % population-based control ) , participant retention ( 93 % eligible complete follow-up visit ) . Information pilot use optimize procedure longitudinal study . We also find gallstone gallbladder cancer associate systemic immune alteration , previously demonstrate , reflect inflammatory change gallbladder detectable bile . The next step demonstrate marker precede GDC longitudinally measure level among gallstone patient . We propose prospectively assess risk factor early detection marker GDC conduct Chile Biliary Longitudinal Study ( BiLS ) , cohort study 6250 individual gallstones high-risk southern-central region Chile . Because woman twice likely gallstone twice likely gallbladder cancer men , plan maximize screening efficiency number outcome screen enrol woman gallstone cohort . This approach reasonable give female gender bias gallbladder cancer largely think due gender bias gallstone , suggest presence gallstone , risk gallbladder cancer men woman . In addition , Chile conduct general population cohort small town high-risk area , use men gallstone enrol Chilean study compare woman study . The cohort complement incident case-control study 300 gallbladder cancer case 450-500 control without gallstone obtain , include men arm study , facilitate exploratory sex-stratified analysis . We plan enroll woman gallstones 2 year follow 6 year , conduct visit every year collect data primary exposure interest , inflammatory marker ultrasound characteristic , well additional exposure interest , infection , genetics , environmental exposure ( e.g. , aflatoxin , pesticide ) .</detailed_description>
