	<brief_summary>Background : The number people get tumor brain central nervous system ( CNS ) low cancer . But tumor cause high rate serious effect even death . Researchers want test exist sample tissue tumor learn . This may lead good treatment . Objective : To study stored sample CNS tumor learn tumor explore new way diagnose . Eligibility : The study use tissue sample already collect NIH people brain CNS tumor . Design : The participant give consent previous study . Researchers review tissue sample data collect . Researchers lab test scan sample . All data keep secure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND - Central Nervous System ( CNS ) brain tumor heterogeneous group neoplasm . They broadly categorize tumor neuroepithelial tissue , meninges , hematopoietic system , germ cell , sella . - The Central Brain Tumor Registry United States report overall average annual age-adjusted incidence rate year 2006-2010 primary brain CNS tumor 21.03 per 100,000 . This lead estimate mortality 13,000 death per year . Although number small compare common cancer , due location CNS ( brain spinal cord ) tumor , responsible disproportionately high morbidity mortality among cancer patient . - Although much progress make overall understanding CNS tumor , much know mechanism responsible intratumoral heterogeneity , disease relapse , progression high grade , vivo invasive mechanism . This may involve new mutation , selection specific clone cell either therapeutic pressure part natural tumor evolution lead progression , microenvironmental cue combination . - This study review molecular pathological alteration archive human CNS tumor specimens initial presentation subsequent relapse . We request archive brain tumor tissue sample NCI CCR Laboratory Pathology multiple time point determine expression cellular protein surrogate marker involve growth , proliferation , differentiation , invasion , survival brain tumor cell . Such information pool imaging data ( MRI , PET , etc . ) identify potential surrogate marker disease resistance . - This study potential uncover key molecular event underlie disease progression thereby contribute understand CNS tumor pathogenesis without active patient intervention . OBJECTIVES -To study archive specimen CNS tumor NCI CCR Laboratory Pathology explore potential new biomarkers diagnosis good understand CNS tumor pathogenesis . ELIGIBILITY - Diagnosis CNS neoplasm . - Eligible case include primary diagnostic study complete , excess tissue analysis form unstained slide paraffin block archive NCI CCR Laboratory Pathology well image store NIH medical record system . - We also request permission extend analysis , may relevant future , surplus material accrue exist NCI protocol , upon completion supersede diagnostic test medical/scientific study . DESIGN - We anticipate obtain approximately 500 archive specimen NCI CCR Laboratory Pathology patient CNS neoplasms analyze parameter order well understand biology pathogenesis disease . - To identify potential specimen , medical record patient see Neuro-Oncology Neurosurgery Clinics review . Additional medical record review order identify archive specimen obtain ancillary information result image study . - Existing biomarker data analyze conjunction review histological feature clinical data exist laboratory image data arrive improve criterion diagnosis , recognize newly identify , yet undescribed , disease entity . New biomarkers , may become available , utilized improve current diagnostic method disease definition . - Tissue may collect pathology process specific research question future time point . Time processing may contingent accumulate sufficient number specimen .</detailed_description>
