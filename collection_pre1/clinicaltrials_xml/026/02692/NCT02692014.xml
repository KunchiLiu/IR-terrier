	<brief_summary>Coronary drug-eluting stent ( DES ) launch China ten year . Although effectively decrease overall incidence re-stenosis , DES inhibit progression atherosclerosis plaque outside segment . It show progression rate non-target atherosclerosis plaque patient DES implantation 6-10 % , indicated current secondary prevention coronary heart disease ( CHD ) far achievement ideal condition . Atherosclerosis many risk factor base current CHD guideline , among level low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) concern one . Large clinical study statins performed world past 20 year . It demonstrate study statins significant primary secondary prevention CHD . What 's , low LDL level reach , low incidence clinical cardiovascular event achieve . However , cardiovascular event still avoidable especially secondary prevention CHD even level LDL significantly control recommended range guideline high dosage statin . It show recent study high load dosage statin may effectively control progression coronary plaque . However , multiple study find hard control progression patient coronary plaque due individual difference . Currently China Food Drug Administration ( CFDA ) approve loading dosage statins possible high safety issue confusion appropriate application Chinese patient , well economy burden Chinese patient high treatment cost . How evaluate individual progression risk coronary plaque enhance risk factor control treatment statin necessary population , currently issue , solve diagnosis treatment CHD . The inhibition progression atherosclerosis plaque absolutely dependent decrease LDL . Large number study find risk factor . For instance , diabetes chronic kidney disease may also associate progression plaque . However , potential impact control still uncertain date . Based background , design retrospective study , Risk Factors Promoting Coronary Plaque Progression In China ( The RIPPER Study ) , solve issue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN This national multicenter retrospective study . Through review angiography database 20 CHD intervention center China . We collect data 2400 patient twice coronary angiography well 12-24 month interval Jun 2013 Dec 2016 . We confirm actual rate coronary plauqe progression CHD patient China well regression analysis investigate impact different risk factor progression coronary plaque , thus find primary risk factor rational strategy secondary prevention . In study , include patient replace withdrawal . STUDY POPULATION 2,400 patient diagnosed CHD receive 2 time coronary angiography within 12-24 month enrol . If number angiography 2 time . Patients receive examination coronary intervention center include . STUDY DURATION It take 12 month collect data 2,400 case 20 CHD intervention center China follow 9 month compete QCA risk factor analysis STUDY PROCESS The statistical analysis include material case . We describe basic history characteristic patient , test parameter image characteristic coronary angiography . Continuous variable describe number , mean , standard deviation ( SD ) , median , minimum value maximum value . Numeric variable normal distribution describe mean SD . Continuous variable compare student test ( normal distribution ) Wilcoxon rank sum test ( skew distribution ) . Categorical variable ( nominal variables/rank variable ) describe frequency percentage , compare Chi square test Fisher exact test . Logistic multiple regression use evaluate risk factor coronary disease progression Chinese patient , among possible risk factor selection base clinical statistical decision . Receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve use establish risk evaluation model coronary disease progression evaluate value . The incomplete data analyze . Data analysis process SPSS 13.0 . All analysis use 2-side test 2-side 95 % confidence interval . There statistical significance 2-side P value less 0.05 . This study use descriptive analysis finally report primary secondary outcome graphic .</detailed_description>
