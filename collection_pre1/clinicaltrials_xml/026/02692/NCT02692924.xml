	<brief_summary>Background : Gravid diseases complication pregnancy . They include gestational diabetes preeclampsia . These cause problem fetus grows . Being pregnant twin make complication likely . Research suggest change fetal soft tissue may earliest sign growth problem . These tissue change lean mass , fat mass , organ size . 3D image might detect change earlier 2D image . This could help manage gravid disease . The NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons measure fetal growth four racial group , Caucasian , African American , Asian , Hispanic . Fetuses obese woman woman twin also measure . 2D 3D image take various stage pregnancy . Measurements take birth . Researchers want expand study measure organ volume body composition racial group twin . Objectives : To set standard body composition organ volume race . To understand relationship gravid disease change fetal body composition organ volume course pregnancy . To find whether different twin single pregnancy . Eligibility : Women participate NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons Twins . Design : The data come NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons Twins . Researchers review scan take previous study . They take measurement scan .</brief_summary>
