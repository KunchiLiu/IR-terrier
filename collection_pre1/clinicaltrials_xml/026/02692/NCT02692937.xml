	<brief_title>Is Chronic Whiplash-associated Pain Neurogenic Origin ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People whiplash associate disorder ( WAD ) grade II-III chronic severe pain symptom reduce quality life . The origin symptom still unknown , date available guideline treatment condition . The lack effective treatment lead high cost patient , society , due considerable medical care work loss . After provide write consent , patient randomize either surgical treatment neurolysis peripheral nerve/s back head and/or neck plus physiotherapy physiotherapy ( care-as-usual ) . Both group treat traditional neck-specific exercise program 12 month . All participant evaluate patient-reported outcome clinical examination baseline , 6 , 12 24 month inclusion . The main outcome change NDI baseline 2-year follow-up . A preliminary sample-size calculation show 27 patient need treatment arm detect clinically important change 10 point NDI , between-group standard deviation 13 point ( statistical power 80 % 5 % significance level ) . To account 20 % drop-out rate , 32 patient include per arm . Because first RCT neurolysis vs care-as-usual treatment , second sample-size calculation include empirical data perform independent statistician , without break code , 30 patient group include . Secondary outcome include VAS ( average pain include pain head , neck face ) , symptom index , self-efficacy , HDI , WAD-DI , psychosomatic aspect , quality life clinical examination . Data perform parametric , non-parametric statistic , appropriate , IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 Mac ( IBM Corp. , Armonk , NY , USA ) . Analysis perform accord intention-to-treat per protocol . To account miss data , previous group mean value consider remain form last occasion use carry forward . For continuous data , difference mean change ( baseline v follow-up ) compare group adjust relation baseline value . For categorical data , difference median change ( baseline v follow-up ) compare group adjust relation baseline value . Effect size calculate measure . This Randomized Controlled Study approve funded National Board Health Welfare Sweden ( project 6168/2007 ) .</detailed_description>
