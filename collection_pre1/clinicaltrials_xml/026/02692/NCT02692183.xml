	<brief_summary>A cornerstone PD ET research investigation neurophysiological change potential bio-markers could help track disease progression response therapy . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) could provide non-invasive relatively inexpensive tool identification bio-markers . In study investigator use high-density electroencephalographic ( EEG ) recording , order develop platform sensitive reliable bio-markers disease progression response MR-guided Focused ultrasound thalamotomy ( FUS-T ) intervention tremor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mapping Functional Networks Brain Activity Using EEG Patients With Essential Tremor Parkinson Disease Before After MR-guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common neurodegenerative disease neurochemical hallmark dopamine deficiency nigrostriatal pathway , characterize clinically movement disorder consist rest tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity , impairment postural reflex gait difficulty . The disease may lead severe neurological dysfunction within several year . Essential tremor ( ET ) neurological disorder characterize presence action tremor different body part mainly hand , head , larynx ( voice box ) , tongue , chin . The low body rarely affect . INSIGHTEC use MR guide Focused Ultrasound perform `` non-invasive '' thalamotomy relieve medication refractory tremor patient ET tremor-dominant PD . The effect MRgFUS base tissue destruction target Vim nucleus thalamus enable highly accurate control thermal effect . Ultrasound energy deliver across skull , without incision craniotomy , heat target tissue protein denaturation threshold temperature near 60Â°C . Prior delivery high temperature , destructive sonication delivery low energy focus ultrasound allows proper anatomic localization , well physiologic evaluation symptom relief and/or unwanted side effect . This process allow adjustment make permanent lesion . Treatment effect immediate several hour treatment generally well tolerate mild sedative . The FUS-T procedure show efficacious procedure tremor ET patient PD patient ; Elminda develop algorithm Brain network activation ( BNA ) Mapping Functional Networks Brain Activity Using EEG . Studying brain morphology function Neuroimaging electrophysiological measure critical understand pathology pathophysiology PD ET . The BNA network shed lite brain connectivity change occur result treatment neurological patient , case patient either PD ET tremor go FUS-T. BNA help understand effect FUS-T brain physiology perhaps identify biomarkers may serve tool chosing best candidate treatemnt optimal treatment parameter .</detailed_description>
