	<detailed_description>Among dental condition common among child dental caries . This condition afflict individual course entire life . However , possible develop prevention mechanism especially childhood ( 1 ) . Dental caries define damage specific susceptible part enamel acid produce bacteria ferment carbohydrate trap within teeth ( 2 ) . A number endogenous bacteria know produce acidic by-product , end destroy tooth . Some notorious bacteria Streptococci mutans , Lactobacillus spp . Streptococcus sobrinus . Release acids fermentation cause fall pH cause decalcify structure enamel , thereby cause irreversible damage form caries ( 3 , 4 ) . Recent research study indicate use probiotic provide future prevention solution caries . The use probiotic therapy base fact oral cavity specific ecosystem bacteria comprise normal flora pathogenic bacteria , live together . Probiotic therapy seek balance oral ecosystem ensure harmful bacteria eliminate . An imbalance oral ecosystem cause dental caries , example , streptococcus mutans , form part normal oral flora result decalcification enamel number rise beyond normal . Probiotic derivative Greek work , mean `` life , '' first use 1965 Lilly Stillwell find contrast antibiotic ( 5 ) . WHO/FAO ( 2002 ) define probiotic live organisms health benefit host administer desirable amount . In number study probiotic , focus reduce number mutans streptococci . The widely use probiotic strain Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium . Irrespective strain product use , various study point reduce number mutans streptococci saliva , effect widely vary study group small ( 6,7,8,9 ) conduct short period ( 6,7,8,9,10 ) . Based finding , efficacy probiotic chewable tablet prevention caries require analysis .</detailed_description>
