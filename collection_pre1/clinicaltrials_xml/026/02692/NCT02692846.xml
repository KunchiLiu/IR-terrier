	<brief_summary>Background : Williams Syndrome ( WS ) genetic disorder . People WS less protein allow part body stretch individual . Researchers interested stretchiness skin people WS may relate cardiovascular problem people WS develop . They also interest identify exposure medication may change elasticity skin vessel . Objective : To learn skin blood vessel individual WS tissue change time . Eligibility : People age 5 70 WS . People age 1 70 medical condition affect connective tissue . Design : Participants screen review medical record . Participants 1 visit . Participants WS may Williams Syndrome Association family meeting camp , NIH . Other participant see NIH . During visit , participant height , weight , blood pressure measure . Researchers listen participant chest abdomen . Participants skin examine . It may photograph . Participants photos eye face take . Researchers use DermaLab Suction Cup Probe . A small suction cup place arm sticker . It pull lightly skin . This allow computer measure skin flexibility . Researchers use SphygmoCor . A probe look like dull pencil place wrist , neck , groin area . A computer measure fast pulse move estimate blood vessel flexibility . Participants may invite procedure repeat later date ( 2 year ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>WS-SAVE Study ( Williams Syndrome Skin Vessel Elasticity Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Williams syndrome ( WS ) multisystem developmental disorder cause deletion 26-28 gene , include elastin gene , locate chromosome 7q11.23 . Cardiovascular disease WS , include obstructive vascular disease hypertension , relatively mild skin change cause elastin gene deletion . Even though WS subject miss one copy gene , expression cardiovascular problem highly variable , range significant disease severe generalize arteriopathy lead infant death . The cause vascular variability currently unknown , male gender disease modifier described date . Clinically , skin describe abnormally soft , smooth easily mobilize , ultrastructurally elastic fiber abnormal reduce amorphous elastin . The overall objective study establish quantitative norm use determine severity vascular disease elastin insufficiency identify risk factor contribute variability . It also important determine stable/variable finding time .</detailed_description>
