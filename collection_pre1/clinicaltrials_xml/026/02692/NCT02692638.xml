	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Early Laparoscopic Enterolysis Versus Nonoperative Management High-grade SBO</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small bowel obstruction common disorder without clearly superior management strategy . There estimate 300,000 surgery perform annually health care expenditure burden excess 2.8 billion dollar . The investigator propose new management paradigm include early laparoscopic management . Contemporary management SBO include trial nonoperative management ( TNOM ) reportedly resolution upwards 70 % patient . Although one common diagnosis surgical admission , prospective , clinical trial address question surgical timing . Additionally , prospective , randomized trial compare early laparoscopy versus TNOM high grade SBO . The hypothesis early laparoscopic enterolysis result decrease overall complication , short length stay , decrease health care cost , low conversion rate open laparotomy .</detailed_description>
