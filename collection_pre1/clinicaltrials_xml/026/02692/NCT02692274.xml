	<detailed_description>Several new diagnostics generation device specifically design assist clinical staff replace equivalent laboratory test allow wide range disease diagnose perform immediately POC . The clinical impact POC diagnostics show variety disease condition , particularly HIV/AIDS TB . The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) call new clinical diagnostics method design function set limited access laboratory service . Thus , lead increase marketing , manufacturing development POC diagnostics instrument reagent use clinical POC . The advent POC test South Africa lead improve control infectious disease HIV mycobacterium tuberculosis ( TB ) , era drug-resistance . Increased availability POC test rural resource-limited setting encourage . To maximize impact novel diagnostics patient outcomes resource-limited setting , implementation new diagnostics must perform within give context culture . However , population-level diagnostic utility South Africa know . The investigator aim estimate level POC diagnostic availability , usage need rural South Africa , use cross sectional survey rural primary healthcare ( PHC ) clinic KwaZulu Natal ( KZN ) . The survey focus condition respondent consider POC test might help improve clinical decision make patient care . Determining current accessibility , availability , usage need POC diagnostics rural resource limit setting help inform developers implementers POC diagnostic service context-specific deployment implementation POC diagnostics address unmet need patient setting .</detailed_description>
