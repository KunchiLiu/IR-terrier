	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Single-Anastomosis Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass With Sleeve Gastrectomy v Laparoscopic Duodenal Switch</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study : ( ) compare SADI vs DS primary bariatric procedure weight loss ; ( b ) compare minor major complication SADI v DS ( c ) compare SADI v DS remission rate type 2 diabetes ( ) compare SADI vs DS remission rate hypertension ( e ) compare SADI v DS weight regain 5 year ( f ) compare SADI v DS metabolic alteration . The investigator hypothesize procedure similar weight loss metabolic remission result . If complication rate SADI similar superior complication rate DS , investigator could propose SADI viable alternative DS patient high BMIs require increase weight loss . The investigator conduct prospective randomize study . The study include 140 patient schedule bariatric procedure . The patient stratify 2 group . The first group continue accord standard bariatric preoperative protocol assign DS . The second group also follow standard bariatric preoperative protocol assign SADI . Follow patient continue accord usual bariatric clinic guideline . From literature , mean excess body weight loss 77.65 % standard deviation 21 % Duodenal Switch bariatric surgery . If truth difference Duodenal Switch SADI excess body weight loss , 140 patient ( 70 per group ) require 80 % power low limit one-sided 97.5 % confidence interval ( equivalently 95 % two-sided confidence interval ) non-inferiority limit -10 % . Participants must meet ALL follow inclusion criterion : - Fulfilled criterion bariatric surgery coin National Institutes Health . - Their age ≥18 year ≤70 year - Able willing give write consent Participants meet follow criterion time baseline visit NOT eligible enrol study : - Contra-indication general anesthesia - Any medical condition , judgment Investigator and/or designee make subject poor candidate investigational procedure - Pregnant lactate female ( Women child bear potential must take pregnancy test prior surgery ) - History alcohol abuse ( &gt; 30 g/day men &gt; 20 g/day woman )</detailed_description>
