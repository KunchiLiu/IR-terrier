	<brief_summary>Deliberate hypotension , reverse Trendelenburg position , hyperventilation technique utilized functional endoscopic sinus surgery attempt reduce surgical bleeding . These method reduce blood flow head neck area assist reduce bleed surgery may predispose patient cerebral ischemia . Large scale study necessary conduct adequate statistical analysis regard effect cerebral oximetry otolaryngology surgery extensively study . This study seek address question whether cerebral oximetry FESS population help evaluate major minor post operative morbidity , well quality recovery surgery . Cerebral oximeter small , noninvasive sticker apply forehead participant give examiner data regard level oxygen saturation around brain course surgery . During course procedure , blood flow head neck area intentionally decrease assist reduce bleed surgery , level oxygen saturation around brain may pose predictor major minor post operative morbidity , well quality recovery surgery . Outcome measure include major post operative complication , neurological cardiac complication , minor post operative morbidity , length post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) length stay , nausea , vomit . Quality recovery also assess use survey conduct PACU first post operative visit approximately one week surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Plan This study conduct Mount Sinai Hospital . Patients recruit read operating room schedule advance contacting patient phone explain study , risk benefit , obtain informed consent prior admission hospital . Objective 1 The specific aim observational study evaluate change cerebral tissue oxygen saturation patient undergo head neck surgery general anesthesia mechanical ventilation use Casmed Foresight cerebral oximeter . Ensuring patient safety surgery upon head neck complex task anesthesiology . These patient present myriad concern need consider create safe thorough anesthetic plan include potentially difficult airway , vary patient positioning , intricate involvement anesthetic drug upon quality surgical field . During common procedure sinus endoscopy , patient undergo endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation airway protection strategy deliberate hypotension implement goal create clean surgical field minimizes avoidable bleeding . The objective strategy allow surgeon complete procedure quickly less hypothetical risk injury due poor visualization structure . However , strategy deliberate hypotension carry potential risk cerebral hypoperfusion lower limit cerebral autoregulation know individual patient basis . Furthermore , mechanical ventilation- particularly hyperventilation- decrease cerebral blood flow potentially compromise cerebral perfusion . The current standard care monitor hemodynamics patient undergo procedure standard American Society Anesthesiologists monitor , include non-invasive blood pressure measurement . The investigator propose use non-invasive monitor cerebral oxygenation cerebral oximeter probe prospective , observational study series patient undergoing routine head neck surgery .</detailed_description>
