	<brief_summary>This project evaluate three different strategy get research finding back manager care unit nurse home . Feedback provide timely effective way result improvement organizational context ( modifiable feature care unit work environment , Formal Interactions , Informal Interactions , Social Capital Slack Time ) , quality care provider ' work life ( e.g. , burnout , job satisfaction , general health ) quality care . Three feedback package test determine strategy effective fostering improvement also cost-effective . The project carry nursing home Alberta British Columbia .

	<brief_title>Improving Nursing Home Care Through Feedback On PerfoRMance Data</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The purpose project systematically evaluate tailor intervention target leader clinical microsystems ( care unit ) residential long term care ( nurse home - NH ) setting . The intervention design feedback performance data improvement . This project key element long term program research ( Translating Research Elder Care - TREC ) focus advance knowledge translation science . TREC 's goal improve quality care , , improve quality life old adult NHs work life care provider . TREC specifically focus important role organizational context ( modifiable element work environment ) clinical microsystem ( clinical unit ) level NHs . Aims : 1 . Evaluate compare standard feedback 2 assist , goal-directed feedback strategy 2 . Assess sustainability long term effect strategy 3 . Refine practical assist feedback strategy use NHs target leader clinical microsystems Design : Pragmatic , three-arm , parallel , cluster-randomized trial ; stratify permuted block randomization ; baseline assessment , 1-year intervention period , post-intervention assessment 1-year long-term follow . NHs randomly assign Standard Feedback ( SF ) , Basic Assisted Feedback ( BAF ) Enhanced Assisted Feedback ( EAF ) . Setting : Stratified ( region size operator ) random sample 67 eligible NHs four region two province : Alberta ( Edmonton , Calgary ) British Columbia ( Fraser Health , Interior Health ) . Facilities participate longitudinal observational study ( part TREC ) generate rich resident , staff , unit , facility level database . Random assignment : The cohort 67 NHs recruit . All site agree expect standard feedback . 22 facility ( 60 eligible unit ) randomly assign SF , 22 facility ( 70 eligible unit ) BAF , 23 facility ( 73 eligible unit ) EAF . Facilities assign BAF EAF approach offer additional feedback . Managers explain specific extra feedback ( treatment ) receive , blind group allocation . Sample : Target intervention manager care unit within NHs . To avoid contamination effect , randomization do facility level , include unit manager facility receive feedback intervention . To determine sample size computer simulation-based sample size approach adapt accounted multiple repeat measure three study arm , complex nest structure ( time point nest within care unit , unit cluster within facility ) . Power sample size estimate base mixed-effects regression model . Using data previous phase TREC ( 2007-2012 ) require parameter enter model estimate . Assumptions SF increase primary outcome ( Formal Interactions [ FI ] score ) 0.2 , BAF increase FI score 0.4 , EAF increase FI score 0.6 . With assumed power 0.90 , significance level 0.05 attrition rate 25 % , total 144 care unit need ( 48 NHs average number three unit 72 NHs average number two unit ) . Intervention : All three group receive face-to-face Dissemination Workshop ( feedback research data modifiable aspect care unit context ) . The SF group receive additional intervention . The BAF EAF arm receive additional face-to-face Goal Setting Workshop two Support Workshops six month interval . Support Workshops virtual BAF arm face-to-face EAF arm . In addition EAF arm receive on-demand email phone support . Feedback include data four aspect organizational context routinely measure TREC validate Alberta Context Tool ( ACT ) . Four ten ACT concept select specific focus : 1 ) number Formal Interactions ( FIs ) care aid provider patients/families ; 2 ) amount Slack Time care aide ; 3 ) Evaluation ( unit feedback ) Practices , 4 ) Social Capital . The intervention design improve performance aspect context . Intervention target clinical microsystem ( clinical unit ) managerial team within NHs : unit care manager director care . Primary outcome : Formal Interactions ( FI ) , define formal exchange schedule activity promote transfer knowledge ( detail see outcomes section ) . Previous research TREC ( 2007-2012 ) clearly suggest context area ACT potential exert great impact quality care implementation change . Of , FI great single impact . At microsystem level unit score 1.9 ( max . possible score 4 ) mean 1.3 , leave substantial room improvement . The correlation FI overall ACT context score .5 , combination FI plus three additional ACT concept ( Evaluation , Social Capital , Slack Time ) increase correlation .8 . Field survey suggest care manager interested FI actionable concept facility context consider prime accessible target action change . FI constitute actionable , cost-effective , easy-to-improve context enhance quality , since mechanism improvement readily available . FI make use exist resource require little investment beyond organizational adaptation ( schedule train meeting session , develop educational material disseminate research finding , etc. ) . Finally importantly , FI also proximal goal . The organizational behavior literature clear goal set distal . Secondary outcome : 1 . ACT context measure : Feedback , Social Capital , Organizational Slack - Time 2 . Staff outcomes : research use , psychological empowerment , job satisfaction 3 . Resident outcome : quality indicator Resident Assessment Instrument - Minimum data Set 2.0 ( RAI ) : worsening pain , decline behavioral symptom . The RAI use internationally comprehensive geriatric assessment health , physical , mental , functional status NH . In Canada use mandate several provinces/territories , well Canadian Institute Health Information national reporting . 4 . Unit facility outcome : response major near miss , manager ' organizational citizenship behavior , performance report , quality improvement activity Process evaluation : 1 . Workshop evaluation survey 2 . Intervention protocol checklist evaluate fidelity workshop delivery 3 . Focus group managerial team directly first support workshop one month second support workshop 4 . Cost accounting intervention Statistical Analysis : Primary Analysis : To compare effectiveness three feedback intervention improve FI score , mixed-effects regression model use . The model account multiple measure within unit cluster unit within facility . All analysis adjust three stratification variable TREC facility sample ( region , owner-operator model facility size ) . Characteristics unit facility compare use descriptive statistic baseline . Based , model adjust baseline variable differ significantly treatment group . Data assess whether meet assumption model ( multivariate normality , linearity , normally distribute , uncorrelated residual , random effect mean zero ) model adjust accordingly . Intention-to-treat analysis conduct , best reflect pragmatic nature study . These result compare as-treated analysis , good reflect adherence/non-adherence intervention . Reporting finding follow Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) guideline . Secondary Analyses : Change secondary outcome ( resident outcome , i.e. , RAI quality indicator , staff outcome organizational variable ) monitor time study arm , outcome compare three study arm use descriptive statistic , Statistical Process Control method , appropriate significance test ( test normally distribute , linear , continuous outcome ; non-parametric test variables n't meet assumption ; chi test categorical outcome ) . A dichotomous variable ( improved/not improve ) assign unit intervention . Then , use logistic regression improvement outcome effect context ( use ACT scale ) , best practice use , staff characteristic improvement investigate . To end reliable classification system individual control chart develop .</detailed_description>
