New participant CR program qualify agree participate study consent randomly assign Intervention Group receive Healing Touch therapy , Control Group , receive HT . At baseline group complete Dartmouth Quality Life SF-36 Health Surveys . The questionnaire repeat end 3 week study period end 3 month SCIM CR program . An effect size 15 % chosen , alpha level 0.05 , 80 % power , 95 % confidence level , use two-tailed test , determine sample size 56 patient group would need group comparison . To account potential attrition study enroll 124 subject , 62 group . Our rationale Healing Touch , addition standard medical care reduce post-cardiac event stress anxiety symptom patient wait enter cardiac rehab program , measure Dartmouth Quality Life Index SF36 questionnaire .

For people heart disease , depression also increase risk heart attack development coronary artery disease . - In one landmark study , continue presence depression recovery increase risk death ( mortality ) 17 percent within 6 month heart attack ( versus 3 percent mortality heart attack patient n't depression ) . Frasure-Smith N , et al . Depression follow myocardial infarction : Impact 6-month survival . JAMA , October 20 , 1993 . 270 ( 15 ) :1819-1825 . RELATED STUDIES HEALING TOUCH use Scripps hospital since 1993 . The Cardiac Healing Touch Program Scripps Center Integrative Medicine Scripps Clinic Scripps Green Hospital collect data 305 cardiac surgery patient . Unpublished outcomes revealed post-surgical cardiac patient experience 74 % reduction pain 71 % reduction anxiety receive HT . In another study perform Scripps Center Integrative Medicine Marine Base near San Diego , call Complementary Medicine PTSD Related Symptoms Returning Active Duty Military , reveal statistically clinically significant reduction PTSD ( p &lt; .0005 , Cohen 's = .85 ) , well depression ( p &lt; .0005 , Cohen 's = .70 ) heal touch guide imagery intervention versus control group . Post-cardiac event patient refer Cardiac Rehab program often find asked wait position become available CR program . In program may involve wait period several week . At Scripps Center Integrative Medicine Cardia Rehab program wait period typically 3 week , slighly . During period , many patient find stress anxiety level reaction recent cardiac event remain untreated . It group patient investigator aim enroll research study determine whether 6 heal touch treatment wait period 3 week decrease stress anxiety enter cardiac rehab program . Moreover , investigator follow patient CR determine whether pre-program HT treatment improve patient 's overall physical outcome measure . Research Methods Baseline Assessment Upon enrollment study , include sign consent , participant answer questionnaire assess baseline status include demographic , brief medical history , follow two questionnaire : Dartmouth Quality Life SF-36 Health Survey . Randomization Following initial assessment , participant randomly assign Intervention Group receive Healing Touch therapy , Control Group , receive HT . All study participant enter CR program either 3 week HT intervention 3 week wait period . If open available immediately follow 3 week period , study subject enter program soon space available . Intervention Group The HT group receive two one hour session per week total 6 session , 3 week . Healing Touch practitioner complete heal touch program certify heal touch practitioner perform heal touch session . Whenever possible patient give treatment practitioner 6 session .
