	<brief_title>ERP Based Single-dose Predictions Stimulants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pediatric neuropsychiatric clinic Ostfold Hospital Trust , Norway , patient diagnose attention deficit hyperactivity disorder test quantitative EEG ( QEEG ) ERPs supplement neuropsychological examination . In majority case systematic four week trial stimulant medication offer , clinical effect evaluated end try-out period . This procedure clinical routine . In study patient parent ask willing complete second QEEG/ERP test single dose stimulant medication shortly onset four week trial . They explain aim study search predictor clinical response . They also inform second test completely voluntary . ( In fact vast majority quite enthusiastic ) . The patient characterize responder ( REs - medication continue ) non-responders ( non-REs - medication stop ) base explicit criterion . The single-dose induced change ERPs ( behavioral parameter attention test ; number error , reaction time ) examine , difference REs non-REs calculate . If analysis data show one several variable significantly different REs non-REs large effect size , finding may eventually result development useful clinical tool .</detailed_description>
