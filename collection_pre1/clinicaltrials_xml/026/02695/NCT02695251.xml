	<brief_summary>Renal functional reserve define glomerular hyper filtration induce protein load . Renal blood flow Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) increase response protein load . Renal functional reserve loss associate persistent hyper filtration state , see first stage diabetic nephropathy , lead progression Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) . This observation lead large clinical study demonstrate positive effect protein restriction kidney function , allow scientific community recommend low protein diet ( less 0.8 g / kg/ day ) prevent CKD progression . Nevertheless , precise mechanism responsible kidney hemodynamic metabolic change induce protein load , debate . Uribarri et al suggest renal hemodynamic change induce protein load mainly due Advanced Glycation End Products ( AGEs ) content . Indeed , initial study experimental condition lead demonstration renal functional reserve ( amino acid protein perfusion cook meat ) , fact responsible AGEs load , base recent publish data . The aim study determine whether AGEs alone proteins general responsible mobilization renal functional reserve , lead progression CKD .</brief_summary>
