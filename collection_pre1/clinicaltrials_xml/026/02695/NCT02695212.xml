	<brief_title>Single Center Study Apremilast Treatment Hidradenitis Suppurativa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label 28-week trial . All Subjects receive Apremilast initial titrate dose per package insert ( 10mg per day day # 1 , escalate 30mg twice daily day # 6 continuation dose ) . The primary efficacy endpoint : The Proportion subject achieve Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response ( HiSCR ) week 16 , define 30 % reduction total number abscess inflammatory nodule count 50 % reduction exploratory endpoint.. The Secondary endpoint : 1 . The number patient achieve one point reduction Physician 's Global Assessment ( PGA ) score week 16 2 . Changes Modified Sartorius scale Baseline Week 16 3 . The number patient achieve two point reduction ( require baseline score ) Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) pain score week 16 4 . Dermatology Life Quality Index DLQI , The study conduct 24 week active therapy follow four week observational visit . The total length study 28 week . Study visit occur Baseline ( Week 0 ) , Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , observational follow 4 week afterwards . Additionally , subject contact phone 1 week follow Baseline visit ensure daily pain assessment record . If sign symptom report time call , unscheduled study visit conduct assess whether infection present . Adverse event collect throughout study .</detailed_description>
