	<brief_summary>The purpose study prospectively evaluate accuracy safety non-invasive intracranial pressure ( ICP ) measurement use HeadSense-1000 ( HS-1000 ) device compare current invasive external ventricular device ( EVD ) parenchymal ( bolt ) monitoring device pediatric population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure ( ICP ) Monitoring Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HS-1000 innovative non-invasive intracranial pressure ( ICP ) monitoring device employ advanced acoustic signal analysis derive ICP continuous basis . The first version device clinically validate trial Italy , India , Armenia . Overall , 10,000 ICP measurement collect patient healthy subject . The device currently undergo FDA validation adult cohort across eight site United States . This pilot study conduct Akron Children 's Hospital . A maximum 40 patient severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) neurological condition require ICP monitoring study 2 year . All patient treat either surgical ICP monitor ( external ventricular drain [ EVD ] subarachnoid manometer [ Bolt ] ) eligible study enrollment . The HS-1000 device deploy soon possible surgical ICP monitor placement record collect data parallel surgical device . To assess accuracy safety HS-1000 device alternative invasive ICP procedure , investigator compare ICP reading obtain HS-1000 monitoring system measurement record surgical device 15-30 minute record session . ICP reading record invasive HeadSense non-invasive ICP monitor aggregate 30 minute . During record session , webcam take periodic snapshot ICP monitor and/or bedside monitor picture ICP value clinical parameter display screen , focus blood pressure heart rate ( HR ) . Recording session do aggregate least 30 minute data collect , depend patient 's clinical condition . Recording session may repeat several day 30 minute target reach . The HeadSense headset remove recording . Recording do case patient 's clinical condition allows ( i.e . patient supine position require clinical intervention treatment time record ) . In case patient require clinical intervention record stop resume intervention do patient 's clinical condition allow resume record . Lastly , investigator also place commercial sound meter participant 's room collect baseline data exposure ambient noise within Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) treatment environment . This data facilitate device-vs-ambient sound comparison , component device safety profile . Study patient demographic collect include patient medical record number , age , gender , diagnosis , medical information , patient 's clinical course pertinent ICP monitoring attend physician determines invasive ICP measurement longer necessary . Additional demographic , diagnostic parameter , severity illness calculation , procedure obtain Virtual Pediatric Systems ( VPS , LLC ) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit clinical outcome database . The patient follow 48 hour post ICU discharge adverse event . The diagnosis head trauma medical condition indicate need ICP monitoring , decision place intraventricular catheter duration ICP monitoring discretion patient 's clinical care team independent study . With exception simultaneous use non-invasive acoustical HS-1000 monitoring system ambient noise level measurement within patient 's room , patient care , include clinical evaluation treatment , independent study . No HS-1000 data display used clinical decision making .</detailed_description>
