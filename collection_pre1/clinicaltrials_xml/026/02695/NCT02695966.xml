	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause cancer-related death Western country . It lethal disease typically present late , metastasise early resistant conventional treatment radiation chemotherapy . In 2012 8700 death UK pancreatic cancer , make fifth common cause cancer-related death . Current therapeutic strategy aim extend survival well improve symptom quality life , although conventional chemotherapeutic agent achieve modest clinical benefit , need novel therapy great . This study propose extend pre-clinical study develop ex-vivo assay assessment AMD3100 effectiveness human sample . The research team investigate feasibility assess primary human pancreatic tissue change T lymphocyte function localisation presence absence AMD3100 obtain blood sample fresh pancreatic tissue intra-operatively pancreatic tumour locate head pancreas .</detailed_description>
