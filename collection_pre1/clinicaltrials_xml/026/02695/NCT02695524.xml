	<brief_title>Exercise Application Treatment Patients With Shoulder Impingement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence effectiveness conservative treatment shoulder impingement favor application specific exercise scapulothoracic muscle rotator cuff pain reduction improvement upper limb function , supervise perform home , exercise associate therapy promote great reduction pain improvement disability . There lack clinical trial literature evaluate effectiveness neuromuscular control focus periscapular muscle . The study area great methodological diversity significant limitation . The hypothesis patient shoulder impingement receive traditional exercise protocol addition neuromuscular training show less functional disability , great reduction pain intensity , increase muscle strength range motion compare patient group receive protocol without neuromuscular training , immediately intervention , four eight week four month randomization benefit clinically relevant .</detailed_description>
