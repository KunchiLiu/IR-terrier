By personal experience subgroup among CLBP patient select , possibly represent patient pain motion segment/disc , thus make patient selection specify . Furthermore , selection level fuse base radiological finding find reliable . Therefore mechanical provocation test develop clinic . The aim randomize study compare outcomes pain pain related function perceive specific subgroup CLBP patient follow fusion surgery follow non-surgical treatment . Methods : Patients specify symptomatology specify clinical sign examination recruit randomized either type treatment , non-surgical ( NS ) include cognitive-behavioral therapy physiotherapy ( 37 pat . ) surgical ( S ) , include cognitive-behavioral therapy physiotherapy NS group plus fusion surgery ( 37 pat. ) . All patient thoroughly investigated start study follow-up one year treatment . The outcome perceive patient assess validated questionnaire Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) , Roland-Morris , Balanced Inventory Spinal Disorders ( BIS ) , Short-Form-36 ( SF-36 ) Euro-Quol ( EQ-5D ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. . Title : Lumbar fusion non-operative care treatment presume discogenic pain . A randomized study . Introduction Background objectives : 2. . Only two five exist randomize study compare result fusion surgery chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) result conservative treatment report result surgery well . Systematic review trial also find methodological concern . At present , therefore , clear evidence surgical treatment advisable non-surgical treatment patient suffer unspecific CLBP . 2 b . The investigator hypothesis a/ exists specific identifiable subgroup patient within CLBP group pain emanate disc , b/ patient subgroup may select base thorough symptom analysis , c/ actual disc may localize , radiological method discography , mechanical testing procedure , make pain reduction possible fusion operation level . Methods Trial design : 3 . A RCT parallel group design pre- post-treatment data . 3 b . No change make trial commencement . Participants 4 . Inclusion criterion : 18 65 year , pronounce low back pain least one year try ordinary physical therapy without improvement sick leave least 50 % . They prior fusion operation may surgery e.g . disc herniation . 4 b . Eligible outpatient Clinic Spinal Surgery , Strängnäs , Sweden , inform study consent participate include , receive ordinary treatment outside study . Data collect Clinic Spinal Surgery , Strängnäs , Sweden . Interventions 5 . A percutaneous mechanical provocation test develop obtain information regard possibly painful segment . Local disc injection also perform analyse pain response needle contact disc , injection disc saline local anaesthetic blind patient also pain situation follow local anaestetics disc , discoblock . Further , open mechanical provocation test develop analyse location possibly painful disc . Operation posterior lumbar interbody fusion perform use microsurgical technique autologous bone . Internal fixation use . Patients group , surgical ( S ) non-surgical ( NS ) group , treat formal physiotherapy five day stay Clinic instruct continue training home accord line give Clinic . Patients group similarly treat individually cognitive-behavior therapy seven occasion . Outcomes 6 . The primary outcome back pain , assess patient BIS VAS treatment follow-up one year treatment well perceived change pain . Secondary outcome pain related function assess ODI , Roland-Morris , BIS questionnaires . Health related quality life also assess secondary outcome measure , use SF-36 EQ-5D questionnaire . 6 b . No change trial outcome make study . Sample size 7a . The sample size calculation perform study start statistician ( ES ) . It base previous knowledge outcome Swedish cross-sectional study ( surgery v physiotherapy ) proportion patient improvement 63 % 29 % , respectively . Assuming similar result improvement total sample size 66 ( 33+33 ) detect difference statistical power 80 % . 7 b . Interim analysis occur . Randomization . Sequence generation . 8 b . A randomization scheme balance female/male , well surgery/non-surgery patient perform use random permute block 20 ( 10 female 10 male ) patient order reduce predictability . The permutation block randomly choose . Two set close envelope numbered order , one set males one female , either message `` operate '' `` operate '' deliver clinic statistician involve treatment patient . Allocation concealment mechanism 9 . The patient consecutively include study accord randomization envelope . Implementation 10 . A statistician involved treatment patient generate random allocation sequence . The surgeon enrol participant anaesthesiology nurse clinic perform practical assignment , i.e . open close envelope consecutive order . Blinding 11 . In accordance treatment alternative participant care giver could blind group assignment . 11 b . Patients group , surgical non-surgical , receive equal cognitive-behavioral treatment physiotherapy . Besides , patient surgical group operate spinal fusion . Statistical method 12 b . The outcome variable assess rating scale generate ordered categorical data . Characteristic feature order structure lack information regard size inter-categorical distance . Non-parametric rank-based statistical method take account limited mathematical property order categorical data use description analysis . Frequency distribution , proportion , bar chart , median quartile use statistical description cross-sectional data . Statistical analysis difference outcome assess transitional scale BIS two group patient perform Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test . Statistical evaluation change pair assessment make treatment follow-up occasion make statistical approach develop paired ordinal data provide measure systematic change common group additional measure individual variability . The measure 95 % confidence interval systematic change position ( RP ) , concentration ( RC ) , measure individual variability ( RV ) calculate well difference measure two treatment group . This approach find high power detect difference small sample . Results 13 . All patient surgical well non-surgical group receive allocated treatment . All patient group see follow-up . Recruitment 14 . Recruitment start July 4 , 2007 end last patient include study March 28 , 2011 . The follow-up take place Oct. 21 , 2008 June 27 , 2012 . 14 b . The trial perform plan . Numbers analyse 16 . The analysis carry complete group 37 patient group miss patient . Outcome estimations 17 b . The material fully analyse yet . Ancillary analysis 18 . None . Harms 19 . There surgical complication , neurological deterioration device failure . Five 37 patient group S defect bone heal re-operated anterior fusion level , one patient anterior fusion new level 3 patient fixation screw extract due local pain . Comment Limitations : 20 . There rather small sample size difficulty recruit eligible patient , good research team choice appropriate statistical analysis show power study . Generalizability 21 . The investigator regard result generalizable , provided patient level fuse select accord criterion present study . Interpretation 22 . Based result exist randomized study compare fusion surgery conservative treatment patient suffer CLBP evident surgery advisable . However , previous study symptoms patient select describe simply `` chronic low back pain '' . The patient investigator study select base specific symptom analysis . Furthermore , previous study level fuse choose base radiological finding whereas mechanical provocation test use present study . Two previous study state importance cognitive-behavioral therapy CLBP patient , result equally good result follow fusion surgery . To study specific effect surgery , therefore , group investigator study receive quite treatment cognitive-behavioral therapy physiotherapy , difference two group one group also receive surgery . Other information Registration : 23 . The study protocol approve Regional Ethics Committee , Stockholm ( reference number 2007/598-31/4 ) . In accordance Declaration Helsinki , patient thoroughly inform concerning part study , verbally write text , give write informed consent . 24 . The full trail protocol access via Bo Nyström , Clinic Spinal Surgery , Strängnäs , Sweden . 25 . The study fund support .</detailed_description>
