	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study well 18F-fluoromisonidazole ( [ 18F ] FMISO ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) work transcatheter arterial embolization image tumor patient liver cancer . Transcatheter arterial embolization block blood flow tumor cell insert tiny foreign particle artery near tumor . [ 18F ] FMISO type radioimaging agent bind large molecule tumor cell low level oxygen , radiation give [ 18F ] FMISO pick PET scan may help researcher learn whether change occur tumor treatment , help decide well treatment work earlier currently possible</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18FFMISO PET/CT After Transcatheter Arterial Embolization Imaging Tumors Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine variability 18F FMISO uptake hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) tumor compare normal liver transcatheter arterial embolization determine difference mean maximum standardize uptake value ( SUVmax ) tumor-to-liver ratio ( TLR ) region normal liver 5 index tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine area tumor recurrence determine CT magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) within 6 month period transcatheter arterial embolization show evidence increase 18F FMISO label initial post treatment 18F FMISO PET/CT . II . Determine variability SUVmax TLR untreated ( non embolized ) HCC lesion compare normal liver determine difference mean SUVmax TLR normal liver tumor . III . Determine toxicity relate [ 18F ] FMISO use PET/CT . OUTLINE : Patients undergo transcatheter arterial embolization . Patients also receive 18F-fluoromisonidazole intravenously ( IV ) undergo PET/CT scan within 4 week prior embolization treatment 20 hour follow completion treatment . After completion treatment , patient follow 2 3 month .</detailed_description>
