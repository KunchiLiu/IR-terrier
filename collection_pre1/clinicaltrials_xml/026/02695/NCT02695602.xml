	<mesh_term>Nasal Obstruction</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Symptoms chronic nasal obstruction exam find turbinate hypertrophy , without septal deviation eligible study . Failed medical treatment Have fail medical treatment least 1 month , offer surgery Patients Septoplasty time turbinate reduction surgery . Patients previous turbinate reduction surgery exclude . Patients nasal polyp , chronic rhinosinusitis , adenoid hypertrophy , nasal tumor , exam find would explain symptom nasal obstruction enlarge inferior turbinate without septal deviation exclude . Patients diagnose purely bony inferior turbinate hypertrophy discuss . Patients hormone anticoagulation therapy history head neck radiation therapy exclude . All study candidate assess external nasal valve collapse via modified Cottle maneuver , exclude exhibit significant external internal nasal valve collapse primary cause nasal obstruction . All patient complete Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) nasal obstruction decongestion preoperative visit . Patients fail report score less 5 decongestion likely bony rather soft tissue hypertrophy . In patient MAIT unlikely adequate surgical option , would derive great amount benefit SMR . Therefore patient exclude study , offer SMR .</criteria>
