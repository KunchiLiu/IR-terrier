	<brief_summary>The influence preterm gut microbiota health disease well establish . However , relatively little known microbiome change discharge relationship growth , health disease outcomes preterm population . This study aim follow cohort preterm infant explore relationship later microbiome ( 'after discharge ' ) later growth health outcome infancy . The study also explore effect time stop routinely administer probiotic post-discharge microbiome , infant feeding outcome colic . The investigator aim longitudinally follow 40 infant born 32 week gestation also take part investigator microbiome study NICU stay ( SERVIS REC No : 10/H0908/39 ) microbiomic sample adequately achieve . The investigator collect stool beyond time anticipate discharge ( beyond 34 week ) target include pre- post-weaning , year . Actual discharge time infant varies , usually late immature infant , allow assessment influence physical location ( NICU v home ) well increase age . Using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon analysis , investigator assess bacterial colonisation gut measure infant weight , length head circumference time point . The investigator use parent questionnaire assess daily cry time , parent ' perception colic severity use visual analogue scale well vomit constipation two week sample .</brief_summary>
