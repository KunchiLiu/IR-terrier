	<brief_summary>The primary aim NIA sponsor ancillary study phase 2 CALERIE measure whether metabolic adaptation last 2 year response 25 % calorie restriction normal-weight slightly overweight individual . Energy metabolism ( 24-hour sedentary sleeping ) measure respiratory chamber . Other measure include activity sympathetic nervous thyroid ax , oxidative stress lipid , protein DNA , organ size MRI echocardiography , posture allocation ( time spend engage different activity energy expend activity ) , activity temperament ( innate predilection movement ) . This set study allow assessment whether previously observe metabolic adaptation response 25 % caloric restriction long lasting ( two year ) , associate reduce thyroid sympathetic activity reduce oxidative damage . The study organ size ( liver , spleen , kidney , heart , adipose muscle ) MRI echo ( heart ) essential determine whether metabolic adaptation relate decrease organ size improve organ energy metabolism efficiency . The described measure perform baseline 1 2 year 25 % caloric restriction 50 non-obese human 25 sex- , BMI- age- match subject engage caloric restriction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis 1 : The decrease energy expenditure ( sedentary sleeping ) large expect basis loss fat-free mass fat mass even weight stabilization . Aim 1 : Determine metabolic adaptation 1 2 year 25 % CR Hypothesis 2 : The metabolic adaptation ( accounted decrease FM FFM ) entirely account reduced organ/tissue size ( liver , spleen , kidney , heart brain ) accompany reduced activity sympathetic thyroid system . Aim 2 : Assess contribution organ sizes activity thyroid sympathetic system metabolic adaptation . Results compare vivo vitro oxidative phosphorylation ( Smith , PI ) . Hypothesis 3 : A decrease marker oxidative stress lipid ( urinary isoprostanes ) DNA ( strand break ) blood protein ( carbonylation thiol oxidation ) blood skeletal muscle tissue 1 2 year CR observe . Aim 3 : Determine change oxidative stress 1 2 year 25 % CR measuring urinary isoprostanes , serum carbonyl , DNA damage nucleate blood cell protein oxidation ( carbonyls oxidation cysteine residue ) skeletal muscle .</detailed_description>
