	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Intestinal metaplasia ( IM ) consider precancerous lesion associate small increase gastric cancer risk . Generally widely accept guideline IM management . Recently , European Endoscopic Society European academic company develop evidence-based guideline management patient IM . These instruction highlight increase risk cancer patient gastric atrophy IM need stag case high-grade dysplasia . Risk factor IM include infection Helicobacter pylorus , high NaCl intake , smoking , alcohol consumption chronic bile reflux . The four step sequence event development intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma include : Non-atrophic gastritis , multifocal atrophic gastritis , IM , dysplasia . Reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) produce by-product normal metabolism cell . ROS generate response ultraviolet radiation , smoking , alcohol , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory , ischemia-reperfusion , chronic infection chronic inflammatory disorder . Disruption normal homeostasis cell , due change redox homeostasis lead development cardiovascular disease , neurodegenerative disease cancer . The production ROS gastrointestinal tract ( GI ) role pathophysiology pathogenesis gastrointestinal disease study sufficiently . Despite protective barrier provide digestive mucosa , different molecule may present content GI , well various pathogen cause oxidative damage inflammatory response intestinal mucosa immune cell . Pathogenesis various GI disease , include ulcerative lesion , cancer , inflammatory bowel disease attributable part oxidative stress . In plasma patient , context sequence gastro oesophageal reflux-oesophagitis-metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma , find simultaneous formation DNA adduct increase myeloperoxidase concentration , associate oxidative stress , decrease antioxidant capacity ( decreased glutathione concentration ) .These finding support role oxidative stress pathogenesis malignant transformation . On hand , since chronic inflammation recognize important risk factor development GI tumor , underlie molecular mechanism study extensively . Chronic inflammation may induce cell mutation promote malignant transformation normal cell GI mucosa . The inflammatory reaction generate carcinogenesis involve formation reactive oxygen nitrogen specie ( ROS RNS ) derive mononuclear phagocyte lymphocyte , well development immune response , production pro-inflammatory cytokine . Nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) consider main mediator immune response . The activation NF-κB phosphorylation lead translocation NF-κB nucleus , regulate transcription several pro-inflammatory cytokine chemokines . Furthermore , chronic inflammation create appropriate condition genomic epigenetic change . Obesity , particularly abdominal obesity , associate insulin resistance peripheral tissue abnormal fatty acid metabolism , often lead type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2 ) development . Insulin resistance , hyperinsulinemia , hypoglycemia cytokine production adipocytes ( adipokines ) also result endothelial dysfunction , disorder lipid profile , hypertension vascular inflammation , promote development atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . In patient coexistence metabolic risk factor DM2 cardiovascular disease ( abdominal obesity , hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia hypertension ) suggest existence `` metabolic syndrome '' . Metabolic Syndrome ( MS ) recognize pro-inflammatory , pro-coagulant state associate increased level C reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin ( IL ) 6 plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI ) 1 . It report inflammatory pro thrombotic marker , associate increase risk cardiovascular disease DM2 , represent part relationship IM cardiovascular mortality . Furthermore , causal relationship increase level CRP level MS incidence find . The value several marker monitor patient MS remain uncertain.The use marker make clinical purpose , respect determination cardiovascular risk assessment . The guideline Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) emphasize analysis CRP still belong optional test , power independent predictive remain uncertain . Several factor influence pathogenesis MS , pro-oxidant condition patient may increase risk develop symptom relate chronic disease DM2 . The reduction antioxidant capacity individual IM explain concomitant overproduction ROS metabolite ( d-ROMS ) , decreased activity enzyme neutralize ROS ( SOD , CAT GPx ) reduction antioxidant system , PON1 activity . Recently , γGT suggest promising biomarker diagnosis MS , level serum may reflect response oxidative stress . Moreover , correlation SOD various active moiety MS may indicate SOD activity could better biomarker oxidative stress patient . The measurement SOD activity could use predictive tool determine extent underlie oxidative stress disease . These finding suggest study oxidative state earlier phase MS may start point understanding pathway contribute progress MS subsequent complication . Although exact contribution oxidative stress every pathologic condition include MS difficult determine definitively , certain oxidative stress particularly high MS . It seem increase oxidative stress main mechanism behind increased tendency develop cardiovascular disease , great severity cardiovascular disease young people poorer treatment outcome . Regarding relationship MS GI diseases , study report patient MS almost twice risk develop Barrett 's esophagus . If finding confirm prospective study , patient MS could form high-risk group develop Barett 's esophagus esophageal adenocarcinoma . The prevalence MS concern development Barett 's esophagus particularly relationship length damage change level leptin , insulin proinflammatory marker , indicate change cause development Barrett 's esophagus constant affect metabolic change cause adipokines cytokine . The relationship MS , gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , development IM also require well design prospective study . It seem however , correlation obesity GERD , well obesity gastric adenocarcinoma . AIM OF THE STUDY : This study aim analysis oxidative stress marker marker inflammation patient IM MS , patient IM alone , healthy volunteer , well impact therapeutic protocol , association marker extension lesion . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A group patient IM MS , group patient IM alone , group healthy volunteer . Every group patient divide subgroup base age gender .</detailed_description>
