	<brief_title>Investigating Prevalence Prognostic Importance Polypharmacy Adults Treated Newly Diagnosed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) increase age . Older AML patient , generally define age 60 year , bad treatment outcomes young patient . While select old patient benefit standard therapy , group experience increase treatment-related toxicity , decreased remission rate , decrease disease-free survival decrease overall survival . Outcome disparity part explain age relate biologic feature . Older patient likely present unfavorable cytogenetic abnormality , multidrug resistance phenotype , secondary AML . However , even old adult favorable tumor biology bad prognosis compare young patient . Patient-specific factor include impaired physical function comorbidity independently predict increase treatment toxicity decrease survival . Improving patient assessment strategy critical identify patient likely benefit induction post-remission therapy . Treatment decision-making older adult hamper difficulty accurately predict vulnerability toxicity . Increasing age alone risk factor poor response therapy . Older adult chronologic age represent heterogeneous population . Multiple patient-specific factor may impact old adult 's ability tolerate tumor burden treatment . Comorbid disease , functional status cognitive status examples factor reflect individual patient 's reserve capacity ; none adequately assess chronologic age alone . Translating geriatric assessment strategy evaluation old patient acute leukemia help refine treatment approach population . One strategy commonly use geriatric medicine comprehensive geriatric assessment ( CGA ) . CGA refers multidisciplinary evaluation geriatric domain , include comorbid disease , physical function , cognitive function , psychological state , nutritional status , medication management . In old cancer patient CGA identify problem may interfere cancer treatment recommend NCCN Guidelines `` Senior Adult Oncology '' . The optimal measure use change management base result less clear . Medication management may particular importance old adult AML due potentially high prevalence polypharmacy population . Studies older adult cancer report average number medication range 4-9 . These number may high patient actively treat acute leukemia . Polypharmacy associate increased adverse drug reaction increase risk drug-drug interaction . Careful medication review discontinuation potentially unnecessary inappropriate medication may minimize negative consequence polypharmacy . To date , however , prevalence prognostic significance polypharmacy evaluate adult undergo treatment AML . Investigating significance polypharmacy population may help improve patient assessment provide opportunity design simple intervention minimize unnecessary morbidity associate treatment .</detailed_description>
