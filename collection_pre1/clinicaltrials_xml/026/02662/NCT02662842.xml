	<brief_summary>Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion ( CSII ) via insulin pump therapy show improve quality life glucose control many patient diabetes opt treatment modality . Despite significant innovation advancement pump technology , insulin infusion set area innovation significantly lack clinical study perform prior product launch . BD develop subcutaneous infusion set FlowSmart™ Technology design address patient comfort , insulin delivery flow interruption . According preliminary animal clinical study , technology result low infusion pressure indicate consistent insulin delivery . The FlowSmart infusion set previously test prototype form healthy non-diabetic subject set inserted nurse , CSII-using patient self-inserted FlowSmart infusion set clinical research setting . The purpose study determine insulin pump user prefer use BD FlowSmart infusion set compare current set respect insertion pain wear comfort .</brief_summary>
