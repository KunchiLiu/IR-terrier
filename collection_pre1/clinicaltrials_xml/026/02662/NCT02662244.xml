	<brief_summary>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) common skin cancer worldwide . Although tumor rarely life threatening , locally destructive cause significant cosmetic functional problem . Standard therapeutic modality BCC often result disfigurement surgical treatment recurrences topical therapy . Thus , need alternative non-surgical option effective , efficient , low risk side effect . This lead emergence laser investigation treatment BCC due ease treatment , lack significant downtime , decrease risk complication , absence surgical scar . The primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy laser treatment subject BCC trunk extremity . Subjects receive one treatment laser BCC . Standard excision perform 30 90 day laser treatment evaluate resolution BCC . A visit suture removal perform appropriate site surgery . Standardized photograph measurement take baseline visit , immediately laser treatment day excision .</brief_summary>

Complications surgical non surgical procedure The laser device use immediate direction principal investigator co-investigator , Drs . Arisa Ortiz Brian Jiang , laser certify operator . Only credentialed laser user hospital operate device . Only Dr. Ortiz Jiang operate device . Dr. Ortiz report minor major adverse event ( per University California HRPP ( Human Research Protections Program ) report guideline occur study , immediately UCSD Human Research Protections Program . Any risk eye damage subject participate study eliminate wear protective eyewear laser use . Laser pulse produce immediate sensation comparable pin-prick rubber band snap skin ( mild moderate pain ) treatment site , may transient sensation sunburn irradiation disappear period several day . The following list potential adverse event could occur use laser device study . Please note goal laser therapy produce damage necrosis tumor . Therefore sign effect , include inflammation purpura expect outcomes recorded adverse event . Subjects enrol may expect side effect ( purpura , erythema , edema ) laser-treated site . Erythema edema usually disappear within 24 72 hour . Purpura may persist approximately one two week . Blistering scale treat site may also develop rare temporary . Scarring , ulceration , post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation hypopigmentation , infection also occur rarely . The risk infection minimize proper wound care . If infection evident treat site time schedule excision , infection treat appropriately excision postpone 2 week infection resolve . Standard excision BCC associate small risk recurrence . This risk increase result study . Subjects provide post laser-treatment post excision instruction ( see attach ) . 2 . Drug side effect toxicities The drug use protocol lidocaine/epinephrine local anesthesia . Patients ask regard allergy medication . No adverse effect anticipate . However , allergic reaction may occur medication . 3 . Device complications/malfunctions Laser device Operating treat device restrict authorized trained personal . If investigator evidence device malfunction potentially hazardous subject interfere performance device , treatment shall immediately interrupt IRB notify . Eye injury due use laser system risk subject operator . Goggles label specific use 1064 nm laser . Subjects investigator anyone present room wear appropriate protective goggles procedure avoid potential eye injury . 4 . Psychosocial ( non-medical ) risk The investigator anticipate psychosocial risk due study . However participant experience emotional distress study investigator assist resolve stress appropriate referral . Steps prevent outcome include detailed explanation study expect study treatment . 5 . Radiation risk This laser emit ionize radiation . Therefore , risk associate type radiation non-existent . This laser emit light visible infrared range optical spectrum therefore thermal interaction tissue expect . VIII . Potential Benefits 1 . Potential benefit participate individual There direct benefit subject participate study 2 . Potential benefit society The result study help u acquire information may lead development improved treatment skin cancer . X . Monitoring Quality Assurance 1 . Independent monitoring source data At time investigator anticipate need independent monitor monitor data sufficient ensure validity integrity data adherence IRB-approved protocol . Patients recruit scheduled office visit exam room . Consent obtain exam room , patient opportunity ask physician question . The investigator make every effort accurately document data study case report form . All source data organize file individual subject binder . Any pertinent note file regard subject shall document study investigator keep applicable subject binder . The principal investigator shall review data ongoing consistent basis throughout duration study . Study number use deidentify patient . All subject must assign study identification number item appear subject binder photograph . Electronic digital image , label study identification number , store patient binder secure hospital server . Only investigator involve study access data . Even precaution , risk loss confidentiality . If occurs , subject notify immediately . This study shall perform accordance applicable federal , state local law regulation , include without limitation 21 CFR Parts 50 56 Health Insurance portability Accountability Act 1996 ( `` HIPAA '' ) regulation official guidance promulgate . 2 . Safety monitor Safety data collect visit study . Investigators perform overall efficacy assessment study . The Principal Investigator review data ongoing consistent basis throughout duration study . The Principal Investigator responsible protect right , safety , welfare subject his/her care . The Principal Investigator responsible review determine whether research alter stop . If severe adverse effect death directly related procedure propose occurs , Principal Investigator report IRB . 3 . Outcomes monitor Any adverse event review analyzed Principal Investigator soon event occur document subject 's binder . Any unexpected adverse reaction report telephone IRB within 48 hour observe event . If unexpected side effect occur , Principal Investigator also report adverse event FDA . 4 . Adverse event reporting guideline The principal investigator follow UCSD Human Research Committee guideline Adverse Event Reporting .</detailed_description>
