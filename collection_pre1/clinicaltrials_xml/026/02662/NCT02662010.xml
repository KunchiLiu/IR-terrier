	<brief_summary>The overall purpose COMIRB application perform cross-sectional pilot study aid design prospective epidemiologic study NIH grant application . The long term goal research determine AGEs predictor glycemic control development diabetic retinopathy patient T2DM . Understanding relationship could lead prospective prediction onset/worsening diabetic retinopathy T2DM patient pre-diabetic individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Below specific aim research hypotheses pilot study : Specific Aim 1 : To successfully recruit 80 subject ( 40 diabetes , 20 diabetes diabetic retinopathy 20 diabetes diabetic retinopathy ) obtain adequate sample ( blood lens capsule ) testing . Hypothesis 1 : Recruitment subject without diabetes diabetic retinopathy feasible within clinic process collecting , process store sample adequate support full study . Specific Aim 2 : To measure anterior lens capsule AGEs HbA1c level recruit patient . Hypothesis 2 : Levels AGEs HbA1c quantifiable collect sample . The pilot study aim necessary determine feasibility full study , well provide estimate ( 1 ) proportion non-diabetic subject Abnormal HbA1c , ( 2 ) effect size ( 3 ) variance plan full study . The plan specific aim research hypotheses full study follow : Specific Aim 1 : To determine whether anterior lens capsule AGEs differ patient without clinical diagnosis T2DM . Hypothesis 1 : Levels AGEs high patient clinical diagnosis T2DM compare patient without clinical diagnosis diabetes . Specific Aim 2 : To determine level AGEs measure anterior lens capsule correlate level Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) patient without T2DM . Hypothesis 2 : Levels HbA1c positively correlate level HbA1c patient . Specific Aim 3 : To determine among patient T2DM level AGEs measure anterior lens capsule high group diabetic retinopathy compare group diabetic retinopathy . Hypothesis 3 : That among patient T2DM : Levels AGEs high patient diabetic retinopathy compare patient diabetic retinopathy . AGEs elevate patient diabetes ( 1 , 3 ) report role diabetic complication . ( 4 , 5 ) Hyperglycemia result higher intracellular glucose level formation metabolites many complex interaction turn increase production AGEs . AGEs source reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) result oxidative stress tissue . ( 4 ) As report , oxidative stress play important role microvascular cardiovascular pathologic process described T2DM . ( 6 ) Importantly , oxidative stress causal development b cell dysfunction insulin resistance , two hallmark T2DM . ( 4 )</detailed_description>
