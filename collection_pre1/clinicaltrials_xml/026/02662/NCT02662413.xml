	<brief_title>To Determine Validity ACT Adolescent Population With Persistent Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma common chronic illness childhood , adolescent represent group typically difficult engage self-management strategy . Adolescent asthmatic tend poor perception symptom experience high rate asthma death compare young child . Studies show perceived severity asthma symptom relate self-management adolescent , less likely receive appropriate treatment asthma exacerbation 's . This poor perception asthma control likely one cause disproportionate asthma mortality rate see adolescent patient . Because asthma control focus asthma care , assessment control critical step appropriate management . The two domain asthma control , impairment risk , evaluate role asthma play patient 's quality life functional capacity ongoing basis risk asthma present future adverse event . Although National Asthma Education Prevention Program guideline contain rubric asthma control base domain , thus represent `` gold standard '' asthma care , utilization may time-consuming cumbersome implement primary care office , primary care provider may unfamiliar use . For primary care practice follow adolescent patient , remain imperative tool use gauge asthma control evaluate validated at-risk population . At time , approximately 17 questionnaire available use assessment asthma control , although well validate . Of , widely validate commonly use instrument Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) . The ACT self-administered questionnaire intend assess impairment domain past four week complete patient start age 12 year . The ACT five question overall best score 25 . For primarily adult Caucasian population , ACT find valid , reliable , responsive instrument asthma control , cut-offs control well control asthma ( &lt; 19 ) well minimal clinically important ( MIC ) difference ( 3 point ) identify . The measurement property validity , reliability , responsiveness critical usefulness questionnaire clinical research setting . However , measurement property ACT lack adolescent asthma population.The landmark validation study ACT Schatz et al comprise large sample size 300 patient show cut-off score 19 distinguish well-controlled versus well-controlled asthmatic . However , mean age 35 study population , concern raise whether cut-off appropriate adolescent general . Recent study examine use ACT Caucasian Hispanic adolescent population find high optimal cut point distinguish control classification . Lung function measure include rubric assess asthma control NAEPP ( National Asthma Education Prevention Program ) . Per recommendation , spirometry available physician care asthma patient use initiation treatment , change asthma control , every one two year . While sub-specialists often access spirometry , office-based spirometry time-consuming , require technical ability staff training , equipment maintenance calibration , always available feasible use primary care physician office . Because spirometry may limit accessibility primary care provider , questionnaire quickly take lead role asthma management . Studies adolescent asthmatic reveal poor perception asthma control lead under-reporting asthma symptom thus under-treatment exacerbation 's . This type under-reporting reflect false level asthma control query ACT lead inappropriate medical management spirometry utilize .</detailed_description>
