	<brief_summary>Chronic non-healing wound considerably impact quality life affect patient substantial burden Canadian health care system . Microbes colonize chronic wound play important role impede effective healing . Chronic wound colonized polymicrobial community single organism see causal . Only small fraction wound bacteria culture diagnostic test study show little agreement culture molecular base approach , therefore effective diagnostic wound microbe require . It know composition microbial community associate wound change heals although causal relationship somewhat unclear . Although effective treat chronic non-healing wound , antibiotic often administer , contribute concern antibiotic resistance . The wound dressing produce Exciton Technologies Inc. ( ETI ) effectively aid heal process chronic wound unknown mechanism . ETI 's wound dressing contain combination silver salt three different valence , +1 , +2 +3 antimicrobial activity effective reducing biofilm formation vitro . However , know silver salt impact microbial ecology wound role play wound heal . The objective research develop new diagnostic tool base molecular characterization wound sit predict best treat wound identify new microbe target ETI 's technology . This project utilize molecular microbial ecology assessment evaluation topical silver intervention , gain insight management chronic infection . Substantiating microbiota-modifying effectiveness silver wound dressing towards increase clinician patient understand improve clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
