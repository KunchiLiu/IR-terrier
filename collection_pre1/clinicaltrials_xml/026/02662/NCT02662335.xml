	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate feasibility acceptability 6-week computerized work memory train program breast cancer survivor subjectively report cognitive deficit : evaluate feasibility study procedure ( recruitment screening procedure , number participant recruit , screen , retain , attrition rate reason , weekly phone call complete participant ) ; evaluate acceptability adaptive computerized work memory training intervention ( burden , adherence training schedule , performance level achieve , participant satisfaction computerize exercise ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate difference posttest mean T2 ( week # 7 ) adjust T1 ( baseline ) primary work memory outcomes visuo-spatial work memory ( VSWM ) , visual work memory ( VWM ) , executive function ( EF ) measure neuropsychological test ( Rey Auditory Test , Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [ WAIS ] IV symbol test , WAIS IV cod test , Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [ DKFES ] color test , Trails A Trails B test , WAIS IV Letter Number sequence test ) self-report Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) survey ( Applied Cognition General Concerns Short Form , Applied Cognition Executive Function Short Form , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy [ FACT ] Cognitive Function ) intervention group wait control group .
