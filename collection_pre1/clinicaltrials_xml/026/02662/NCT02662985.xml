PDUS change joint synovitis assess use global Outcome Measures Rheumatology ( OMERACT ) -European League Rheumatism ( EULAR ) synovitis score ( GLOESS ) change joint enthesitis assess use OMERACT enthesitis score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Application Power Doppler Ultrasonography ( PDUS ) Measure Response Secukinumab Treatment Patients With Active Psoriatic Arthritis ( PsA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 52-week , multicenter , international study consist 2 4-week Screening period , 12-week randomize , placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period ( Period 1 ) , 12-week open-label treatment period ( Period 2 ) 6-month open-label extension period ( Period 3 ) . Treatment Period 1 12-week placebo-controlled , randomized period primarily design demonstrate early optimal efficacy secukinumab v placebo joint synovitis use PDUS via GLOESS global entheseal score 12 week treatment . The main aim Period 2 assess maintenance increase magnitude treatment response joint synovitis patient original secukinumab group assess time course response secukinumab joint synovitis original placebo group switch secukinumab Week 12 . The main aim Period 3 ( extension period ) allow patient respond secukinumab extend study treatment Week 52 commercial drug become available , whichever occur sooner .</detailed_description>
