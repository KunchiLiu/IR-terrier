	<brief_summary>Single-injection transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block use treat postoperative pain , become popular within United States high analgesic potency relative ease placement . Unfortunately , long local anesthetic available last 8-12 hour . Continuous TAP blocks—also term `` perineural infusion '' —involve bath multiple nerve abdominal wall local anesthetic use percutaneously-inserted perineural catheter insert anterior ( ventral ) cephalad anterior superior iliac spine . For catheter location , infusion prefer single-injection nerve block duration analgesia may extend good match duration surgical pain . But , unlike brachial plexus , femoral , sciatic nerve perineural infusion , continuous basal infusion local anesthetic provide adequate analgesia TAP catheter . This may due fact TAP relatively tight space , might require bolus fluid adequately spread perineural local anesthetic multiple require nerve ( evidence , single-injection TAP block effective , although limited duration ) . The result single-injection TAP block widely use , TAP catheter adopt . This scenario leave surgical pain untreated follow resolution single-injection TAP block . The recent development infusion pump automatically deliver repeat bolus dos may allow spread local anesthetic multiple sensory nerve necessary provide adequate analgesia , duration well match postoperative requirement . The investigator therefore propose randomize , double-masked , controlled trial determine deliver local anesthetic repeat bolus dose result improve local anesthetic spread/effects compare continuous basal infusion TAP catheter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This investigation randomize , observer-masked , control , split-body , human-subjects clinical trial . Of note , investigator use standard-of-care local anesthetic FDA approve purpose plan research possible change indication use drug part research project . Volunteers solicit use CTRI Research Match exist database volunteer ( IRB approve ) . If volunteer meet inclusion/exclusion criterion ( see Eligibility Criteria ) desire study participation , write , informed consent obtain use UCSD IRB-approved/stamped ICF . A urine pregnancy test administer woman childbearing age follow write informed consent study intervention . This urine test administer CTRI nursing staff use standard , FDA-approved urine pregnancy test device . Perineural catheter insertion : Following write , informed consent , subject admit UCSD CTRI Center Clinical Research Services ( CCR ) demographic/morphometric data record ( e.g. , age , weight , height ) . An intravenous line place upper extremity , follow external monitor ( pulse oximeter , blood pressure , EKG ) , oxygen nasal cannula . Sedation provide intravenous fentanyl ( 50 μg ) and/or midazolam ( 1 mg ) . Bilateral TAP perineural catheter ( FlexBlock , Teleflex Medical , Reading , PA , USA ) insert use ultrasound guidance use technique previously describe . To check perineural catheter placement accuracy , 5 mL normal saline administer via catheter ultrasound guidance definition successful catheter insertion increase fluid volume within TAP ( plane transversus abdominis muscle internal oblique muscle ) . Inaccurately inserted catheter replace . Treatment Group Assignment : Subjects act control : right side randomize one two treatment group : ropivacaine 0.2 % administration either basal infusion ( 8 mL/h ) bolus dos ( 24 mL administer every 3 hour ) . The left side receive possible treatment . Randomization base computer-generated code . Randomization block four . An infusion pump study infusate attach perineural catheter initiate Hour 0 . The basal rate bolus volume depend upon treatment group ( note basal rate bolus volume differ treatment group , total dose local anesthetic ) : The tube pump subject gently wound least 5 rotation cover opaque tape , mask perineural catheter receive treatment ( ropivacaine clear , flow clear tube tape perineural catheter visually distinguishable ) . Local Anesthetic Administration : The infusion pump administer basal infusion initiate Hour 0 . The infusion pump administer bolus dos administer 24 mL bolus dose every 3 hour begin Hour 0 . Perineural catheter remove 6 hour ( total 2 bolus dos ) . Food Drink : Both food accompany beverages/water provide hospital serve nursing staff immediately follow catheter insertion . Meals provide without charge study subject . There restriction oral intake follow catheter insertion . Subjects remain within CTRI-CCR catheter withdrawal . Outcome measurement : At time point , right side measure first , follow left side ( subject supine position ) . Measurements perform baseline ( prior local anesthetic administration ) , 6 hour administration , hour total 7 time point : - Hour 0 ( baseline ) prior local anesthetic administration - Hours 1 2 - Hour 3 , prior schedule bolus dose Hour 3 - Hours 4 5 - Hour 6 The sensory deficit measure use two method : - von Frey filament ( mechanical detection threshold ) - Cold roller ( cold deficit ) The sensory deficit measure along two separate anatomical line time point : - The mid-axillary `` vertical '' line ( measure cephalad-caudad effect ) - A transverse `` horizontal '' line pass anterior superior iliac spine ( measure anterior-posterior effect ) Statistical analysis : The investigator ' calculation focus primary hypothesis use transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block perineural catheter , provide local anesthetic repeat bolus dos increase cephalad-caudad local anesthetic effect compare basal-only infusion volume dose local anesthetic . To measure cephalad-caudad local anesthetic effect , measure cephalad-caudad sensory deficit cold temperature centimeter along mid-axillary line . The primary end point measurement 6 hour local anesthetic administration ( 6 hour continuous basal infusion 2 bolus dos 3-hour increment , last 3 hour prior measurement primary endpoint ) . Each subject act control side receive different treatment . Normality distribution determine use Shapiro-Wilk normality test ( Prism 6 , GraphPad , San Diego , California ) . For normally distribute data , comparison parametric nonparametric data test use t-test Mann-Whitney test present mean ( SD ) median [ interquartile ] , respectively . Nominal data analyze use Pearson Chi square test . P &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Sample size estimation : With 21 evaluable subject 80 % power 0.05 significance level detect superiority administration local anesthetic repeat bolus dos compare continuous basal infusion Hour 6 ( primary outcome ) . Using expected standard deviation 7 cm primary endpoint , give 2-sided Type I error protection 0.05 power=0.80 , approximately 21 subject treatment arm require detect difference treatment group mean 6 cm . Since split-body study design subject one treatment opposite side body , 21 subject total produce 21 subject treatment arm . The investigator choose 6 cm detectable treatment difference 3 cm distance approximately equivalent width one dermatome , vast majority anesthesiologist would consider 2-dermatome difference clinically significant . To allow larger-than-anticipated standard deviation , smaller-than-anticipated difference treatment mean , drop subject , fail catheter , investigator enroll total 24 subject .</detailed_description>
