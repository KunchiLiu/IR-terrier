	<brief_summary>Venous disease effect 25 % population healthy people experience venous symptom stand long . The prime function leg vein drainage . Failure lead condition call chronic venous insufficiency ( CVI ) leg pain , heaviness , swell , varicose vein , ankle skin change , eczema occasionally venous ulcer . The aim study identify blood component ( biomarkers ) occur damage phase stand versus heal phase lie recovery medical compression stocking . This achieve take blood sample ankle region 3 separate visit ( day ) vascular laboratory Ealing Hospital . The first visit supervise stand 1 hour . The second supervised lie third stand whilst wear medical compression stock . Healthy volunteer compare patient advance CVI . The potential importance patient public threefold . Firstly , biomarker profile obtain 3 state increase understand cellular mechanism damage recovery . In way `` bad '' `` good '' biomarkers identify . Secondly , drug treatment may develop research adjust biomarkers towards favourable profile . Thirdly , success treat CVI surgery , venous intervention compression monitor . Whilst known relief gravitational stress treatment form CVI , mechanisms repair discrimination damage yet identify .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well know graduate elastic compression stocking ( GECs ) provide favourable environment off-setting damaging effect dependency , reduce leg oedema , prevent leg ulceration symptom relief . On haemodynamic level , mechanism action augment venous return quantify . However , molecular level , action modulate local endogenous biomarkers towards favourable profile poorly understood . This require investigation . Our hypothesis two type biomarkers : ( ) damage inflammatory biomarkers increase prolonged gravitational dependency , ( ) heal reparative biomarkers increase prolonged elevation recovery . Local venous blood sample drain area investigation may representative loco-regional process systemic blood sample arm . This single centre , collaborative , interventional , control , proof-of-concept trial . The primary aim study investigate effect GEC stocking modulate biomarkers towards heal profile . Planned intervention : There 4 study visit per subject . 1 . Recruitment , patient selection , distribution information leaflets consent form , explanation demand study , claim expense , duplex scan visit scheduling . 2 . Formal consent . Blood test . The stage `` damage '' afternoon stand morning plus hour extra stand laboratory . 3 . Blood test . The stage `` healing '' morning nocturnal sleep plus hour extra elevation ( 20 degree elevate supine ) laboratory . 4 . Blood test . The stage `` treatment '' effect class II knee stock stand morning plus hour extra stand laboratory . All venous blood take ankle region . The sample take gravitational stress , elevation recovery therapeutic effect compression stock . These specification must meet due care diligence ensure result meaningful . The sample collect citrated tube , centrifuge 5,000 rpm 10 minute achieve platelet poor plasma store -20 degree batch analysis . Proposed biomarkers quantification : Radox ( IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , VEGF , IFNγ , TNFα , IL-1α , IL-1β , MCP-1 , EGF ) D-dimer . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP-1 , MMP-2 , MMP-3 , MMP-7 , MMP-8 , MMP-9 , MMP-10 , MMP-12 MMP-13 ) also 4 tissue inhibitor MMPs ( TIMP-1 , TIMP-2 , TIMP-3 TIMP-4 ) .</detailed_description>
