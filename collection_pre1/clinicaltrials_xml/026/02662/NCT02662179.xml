	<brief_title>Are Fried Criteria Predictive Functional Decline Older People With Solid Malignant Tumors ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Identifying frail elderly patient risk become frail become cornerstone modern geriatric medicine . The term 'frail ' elusive quite long time . Several study conduct last 15 year clarify concept : fragility clinical syndrome define increase vulnerability follow decline physiological reserve organic function , compromise ability cope daily life acute stress . Many instrument develop identify fragility individual level . The 'Fragile ' phenotype define Fried ( Cardiovascular Health Study ) base 5 criterion : weakness , slowness , low level activity , exhaustion , unintentional weight loss . The patient fragile meet least three five criterion . It 'pre-fragile ' meet one two criterion . In onco-geriatrics , International onco-geriatrics society recommend implementation 'G8 scale ' detect elderly patient risk fragility . People positive G8 refer geriatric team benefit comprehensive geriatric assessment . This evaluation interpret geriatrician , draws action plan overcome various problem elderly patient . The evaluation also help oncologist choice treatment patient : palliative care , standard treatment adapt treatment ( No-go , Go-go slow-go ) . However , many study show fragile patient great morbidity mortality non-fragile patient . The rate postoperative complication length stay significantly high fragile patient suffer colorectal cancer treat elective surgery . On hand quite surprisingly , another study show none comprehensive geriatric assessment base fragility indicator able predict post-surgery functional decline patient undergone surgery colorectal cancer . One primary goal geriatry maintain autonomy independence patient . The investigator would thus like assess fragility define Fried criterion predictive functional , physical cognitive decline , loss quality life patient treat solid malignant tumor . Furthermore , ass frailness categorization impact oncologic treatment decision . Does oncologist switch patient 's oncologic treatment inform frailness status ?</detailed_description>
