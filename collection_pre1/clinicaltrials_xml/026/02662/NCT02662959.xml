	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer lead cause cancer death China . Most patient unresectable metastatic disease time diagnosis . Systemic therapy require patient advanced stage . Platinum combine fluoropyrimidines always consider first line treatment . After failure initial therapy , single agent taxanes use second line treatment . However , relative standard chemotherapeutic regimen third therapy except oral anti-angiogenesis drug-Apatinib . So study design explore role single agent irinotecan third line treatment patient metastatic gastric cancer China .</brief_summary>
