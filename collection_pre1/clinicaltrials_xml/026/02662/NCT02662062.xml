	<brief_summary>This study enrol patient maximally resect ( via transurethral resection ( TURBT ) non-metastatic muscle invasive bladder cancer , either wish attempt bladder preservation therapy ineligible cystectomy . Patients must adequate organ function performance status receive cisplatin base chemoradiotherapy , contraindication use pembrolizumab . The study enrol 30 patient treat pembrolizumab radiotherapy . All patient plan treat 64Gy radiation therapy 32 fraction 6 week 2 day . All patient receive cisplatin 35mg/m2 IV concurrently weekly radiation therapy 6 dos total . Pembrolizumab commence concurrently radiation give 200mg IV every 21 day , continue 12 week cystoscopy assessment . Surveillance cystoscopy perform 12 week commencement chemoradiotherapy , assess rate complete response therapy . A safety follow visit occur 4 12 week post cystoscopy . From week 31 survival follow commence clinical assessment , cystoscopy CT staging perform interval 5 year . The objective study ass safety feasibility combine pembrolizumab chemoradiotherapy . The primary endpoint assess safety , define satisfactorily low rate unacceptable toxicity ( G3-4 adverse event failure completion plan chemotherapy radiotherapy accord defined parameter ) . The secondary endpoint efficacy , assess complete response rate primary tumour first post chemoradiotherapy cystoscopic assessment . Exploratory analysis include assessment tumour histopathological , molecular , genetic immunological parameter . It expect take two year accrue require 30 patient .</brief_summary>
