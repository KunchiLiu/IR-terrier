	<detailed_description>This study evaluate performance biologically assist core decompression PerFuse instrument BioCUE patient bone lesion femoral head . The study explore potential impact patient demographic baseline characteristic post-operative outcome . The study evaluate change Harris Hip Score ( HHS ) 12 month treatment . The change AVN lesion size also measure 12 month index treatment via MRI . Change quality life pain measure measure follow-up . Adverse event also record throughout study . This study follow patient 5 year initial treatment . Data record online database enter site patient , depend report form . This database include data check compare enter data predefined rule range . A risk-based monitoring plan put place source data verification .</detailed_description>
