Male subject must donate sperm start screening , throughout study 90 day last dose . Subject agree participate another interventional study screen followup visit ( FUV ) study . Subject previously enrol clinical study CK2127107 . Subject clinically significant abnormality follow investigator 's review physical examination , ECG protocoldefined clinical laboratory test screen . A significant abnormality define abnormality , opinion investigator , may ( ) put subject risk participation study , ( ii ) influence result study ( iii ) cause concern regard subject 's ability participate study . Subject liver function test ( LFTs ; i.e. , aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] , alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] , alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ] , γglutamyl transferase [ GGT ] and/or total bilirubin [ TBL ] ) 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) screening .
