	<detailed_description>It estimate 234.2 million major surgical procedure undertake every year worldwide . Surgery one major treatment method patient malignant tumor . And , alone age process , elderly patient undergo surgery malignant tumor . Evidence emerge choice anesthetic , i.e. , either inhalational intravenous anesthetic , may influence outcome elderly patient undergo cancer surgery . Delirium commonly occur cognitive complication elderly patient surgery . The occurrence delirium associate worsen outcome , include increase morbidity mortality , prolong hospital stay , elevate medical care cost , decline cognitive function . High age , major surgery , critical illness major risk factor postoperative delirium ( POD ) . However , relationship use general anesthetic occurrence delirium exclude . There study compare effect two kind anesthetic cognitive outcome surgery . In study Nishikawa et al. , 50 elderly ( ≥ 65 year ) patient undergo long-duration laparoscope-assisted surgery randomly receive sevoflurane propofol anesthesia . The result show , although incidence POD significantly different two group , delirium rating scale ( DRS ) score significantly low sevoflurane group propofol group postoperative day 2-3 ( P = 0.007 0.002 , respectively ) . In study Schoen et al. , 128 patient undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery randomize two group . The result show early postoperative cognitive function significantly well sevoflurane group propofol group , especially experienced cerebral desaturation surgery . On hand , study report contrary result . In large sample size study 2000 patient undergo general anesthesia , patient carry ApoE4 epsilon 4 allele likely develop early postoperative cognitive decline inhalational anesthesia ( odd ratio 3.31 , 95 % confidence interval 1.25-6.39 , P &lt; 0.05 ) , intravenous anesthesia ( odd ratio 0.93 , 95 % confidence interval 0.37-2.39 , P &gt; 0.05 ) . In randomized control trail 44 patient undergoing carotid endarterectomy , mini-mental state examination ( MMSE ) score significantly high , whereas blood S100B concentration significantly low propofol group sevoflurane group 24 hour surgery . In study Tang et al. , 200 elderly ( ≥ 60 year ) patient mild cognitive impairment plan undergo radical rectal resection randomly receive either sevoflurane propofol anesthesia . The result show , although difference incidence cognitive dysfunction 7 day surgery , negative cognitive effect severe sevoflurane anesthesia propofol anesthesia ( P = 0.01 ) . It seem evidence suggest harmful cognitive effect inhalational anesthetic . However , care must take explain result : ( 1 ) target patient population different ; ( 2 ) sample size small majority study ; ( 3 ) diagnostic criterion cognitive complication different , make hard meta-analysis ; ( 4 ) clinical significance early postoperative cognitive complication remain elucidate .</detailed_description>
