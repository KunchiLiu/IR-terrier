	<detailed_description>Incidence rate gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) 10-15 per million per year . Although rare , common mesenchymal tumor gastrointestinal tract , stomach common affect organ 55.6 % . Despite recent drug discovery greatly impacted treatment , complete surgical resection adequate safety margin still potentially curative treatment primary gastric GIST evidence metastasis . As sarcomas general , GISTs also metastasize hematogenously liver , disseminate peritoneally , rarely show lymph node metastasis , therefore systematic prophylactic lymph node dissection usually unnecessary ; pick-up sampling consider sufficient perilesional lymph node enlargement find . In addition , tumor tend soft friable . Therefore pseudocapsule may tear spontaneously inadvertently surgery tumor cell disseminate intraperitoneally result increase risk recurrence decrease survival . Considering property tumor , goal surgery primary gastric GIST handle tumor great care avoid tumor rupture well perform complete resection negative surgical margin preserve organ function much possible . This accomplished traditional open , recently various total hybrid laparoscopic technique . Despite laparoscopic surgical treatment GISTs recommend owe high risk tumor rupture subsequent peritoneal seed consensus meeting United States Europe 2004 2005 respectively , experience rapid major evolutionary process currently advise standard approach gastric GISTs irrespective size location . In addition achieve R0 resection without tear tumor , important issue laparoscopic gastric GIST surgery preserve function cause stenosis stomach much possible . According morphologic characteristic tumor area three-dimensional anatomical configuration stomach involve tumor , lot laparoscopic surgical scenario produce . Among , achieve best alternative meet criteria author generate morpho-anatomical classification system could plan preoperatively tailor gastric resection operational requirement . This system partly inspire TNM classification GISTs Japanese classification gastric carcinoma , long used author ' institution planning laparoscopic intervention various gastric lesion patient appropriate preoperative patient evaluation need . It specifically compose standardized adapt primary gastric GISTs use large tumor 10 cm . The aim study demonstrate feasibility laparoscopic surgery primary gastric GISTs large 5 cm , find accuracy practicality classification system development preoperative strategy extent strategy overlap reality .</detailed_description>
