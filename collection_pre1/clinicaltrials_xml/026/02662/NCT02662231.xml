	<detailed_description>The burden surgically disease low middle-income country ( LMICs ) grow . Specific programme aim raise profile safe surgery anaesthesia global health agenda . The Lancet Commission Global Surgery outline six core indicator assessment global surgical system , include postoperative mortality rate ( POMR ) . Although mortality extreme outcome surgery , affect 1-4 % patient . For major gastrointestinal surgery , effort quantify POMR alone neglect associate morbidity , likely affect far great proportion patient [ 1 ] . More relevant marker postoperative outcome need majority patient , survive surgery . Surgical site infection ( SSI ) common complication follow major gastrointestinal surgery , affect 25-40 % patient midline laparotomy high-income setting , affect adults child . The effect SSI life threaten . They relate one-third postoperative death account 8 % death cause nosocomial infection . Furthermore , SSIs cause pain discomfort , increase time take return home thus amplify patient 's potential nosocomial infection risk . This important economic impact . In UK , hospital length stay double , attributable cost Â£30 million per year . The 2014 prospective , observational cohort study ( GlobalSurg-1 ) include 10,475 patient 58 country . It show incidence SSI double high ( 7.4 % ) , middle ( 14.4 % ) , low ( 20.0 % ) income country . This persist multivariable risk adjustment patient hospital confounders ( middle income : odds ratio 1.96 [ 1.63-2.32 ] low income : 2.06 [ 1.67-2.57 ] ) . In contaminated dirty operation , one three patient LMICs suffer SSI . Dirty surgery double low-income country ( 29.7 % versus 16.6 % high-income setting ) , turn associate double SSI ( 34.5 % low-income versus 15.4 % high-income ) . However , SSI assess secondary outcome measure part study , lack validity require external validation . Antibiotic resistant organism prevalent worldwide focus interest policy leader global health advocate . Some hospital information rate antibiotic resistant SSIs . For patient contract infection cause resistant organism , pose high risk mortality , morbidity require healthcare resource . Currently data exists describe international epidemiology SSIs , causative organism drug-resistance . Therefore , investigate diagnosis treatment SSIs urgent global health priority . The primary aim study determine SSI rate across low , middle high Human Development Index ( HDI ) country . The secondary aim include describe organisms cause SSI rate , use microbiologic test , rate antibiotic resistant SSI . The impact method 30-day follow-up outcome also analyse . Other aim include describe burden surgical disease use 30-day mortality rate , perforate appendicitis rate laparoscopic cholecystectomy rate .</detailed_description>
