	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Idelalisib Treating Patients With Persistent Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma , Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma After Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To improve outcome patient progress relapsed lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) /prolymphocytic leukemia ( PLL ) within 180 day follow allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) compare historical data : 12-month overall survival . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe safety profile observe population . II . Estimate overall response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) standard morphologic , flow cytometric , imaging , molecular technique . III . Assess progression free-survival . IV . Define incidence grade III-IV toxicity infection . V. Estimate incidence relapse non-relapse mortality . VI . Estimate incidence grade II-III III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) chronic GVHD . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 idelalisib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
