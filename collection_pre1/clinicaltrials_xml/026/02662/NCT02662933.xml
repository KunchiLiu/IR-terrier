	<brief_summary>AML disease old adult , median age diagnosis 67 year . An estimated 13,410 new case AML diagnosed 2007 . Survival AML age-dependent , significantly low survival rate report old adult . SEER statistics 1996-2003 show 5 year relative survival rate 34.4 % adult young 65 4.3 % ≥65 year age 1 . Clinical trial demonstrate bad survival outcome older adult AML use age cutoff 55 , 60 65 year . Older adult also experience increase toxicity standard therapy clinical trial . Chronologic age cutoff therefore use research clinical practice due concern regard toxicity associate treatment . The reason increase toxicity decrease survival old adult AML incompletely understand likely multifactorial include tumor specific host specific factor . Improving understand measurable clinical characteristic predict vulnerability toxicity help refine research clinical approach old adult AML .</brief_summary>
