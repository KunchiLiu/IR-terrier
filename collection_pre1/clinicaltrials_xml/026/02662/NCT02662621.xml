	<brief_summary>Recent study show extracellular vesicle ( name `` exosomes '' ) release cancer cell exhibit membrane stress protein HSP70 , contrary exosomes release normal cell . These exosomes ( `` HSP70-exosomes '' ) important role intercellular communication specific biological function promote tumor progression . They find different biological fluid blood urine . We develop protocol able isolate exosomes blood urine . We also demonstrate exosomes derive cancer cell HSP70 membrane . Those result strongly suggest identify exosomes HSP70 membrane patient cancer . Detection HSP70-exosomes diagnosis patient promise pathway research . Because cancer cell release large amount exosomes ( several billion ) since appearance , approach allow earlier detect cancer respect use image circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) , remain rare event ( one CTC 1 billion cell ) . The aim study demonstrate HSP70-exosomes could use early diagnosis patient malignant solid tumor . In order demonstrate , objective study study blood urine sample 60 subject malignant tumor 20 healthy subject ( witness ) .</brief_summary>
