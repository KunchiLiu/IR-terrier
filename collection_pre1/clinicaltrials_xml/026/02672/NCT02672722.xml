	<brief_summary>Renal parenchymal blood flow divide cortical medullary blood flow . Changes factor affect renal medullary blood flow study detail previously investigators/doctors tool monitor renal medullary blood flow vivo . Since Trueta first describe renal medullary blood flow , multiple attempt make study renal medullary blood flow use invasive method . Recently renal medullary blood flow measurement use contrast US emerge promising technique investigator use study renal medullary blood flow vivo . In study investigator aim study change renal parenchymal ( cortical medullary ) blood flow exercise healthy subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study require screen day two visit separate day Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) . Three visit total . Screening Visit : 1 . The subject undergo detailed history physical examination . 2 . The inclusion exclusion criterion review . 3 . The detail study procedure , potential risk benefit review subject potential question answer . 4 . Subjects ' understating detail study component ascertain asked sign inform consent form . 5 . A copy sign informed consent place study file another copy provide subject . 6 . The study visit day schedule within 2 week screen day . 7 . All subject ask arrive first study day overnight fast . They instruct avoid caffeine exercise 24 hour . Study Day # 1 The subject arrive CRU morning . Subjects ' understand study related procedure assess remain question answer . The following sequence procedure follow enrolled subject . 1 . Physical exam include vital sign ( Blood Pressure , Heart Rate , Weight , Height , Respiration Rate , Temperature ) 2 . Urine pregnancy test woman child bear age . If positive , subject exclude . Determination peak oxygen consumption 3 . Subjects complete continuous VO2 peak bicycle ergometer protocol . 1 . Each subject start peddle stationary bike 2 . The initial power output ( PO ) set 20 watts 3 . The power output increase 15 watts every 2-minutes volitional exhaustion . 4 . Metabolic data collect protocol use standard open-circuit spirometric technique ( Viasys Vmax Encore , Yorba Linda , CA ) 5 . Heart rate assess electrocardiographically . 6 . VO2 peak chosen high VO2 attain exercise protocol On Day 2 test 1 . Check Vitals ( BP , HR , Wt. , RR , Temp . ) 2 . Insert peripheral IV line Baseline renal blood flow measurement use contrast enhance ultrasonography 3 . The Definity vial place room temperature use . It activate shake vial use Vialmax® 45 second . It use immediately activation . 4 . 0.4 ml Definity mix 10 ml preservative free saline . 5 . Infusion Definity peripheral vein start 2 ml/min titrate optimal image quality use minipump ( exceed 10 ml/min time ) . 6 . Baseline contrast ultrasound image right kidney perform low mechanical index ( MI ) 0.2 . 7 . 4 - 5 ultrasound impulse high MI 1.0 duration 1 second use destruct microbubbles kidney tissue 8 . Ultrasound image kidney low MI ( 0.2 ) continue immediately impulse several second . 9 . Infusion Definity stop point . 10 . Vital sign monitor every 15 minute continuous pulse oximetry perform Definity administration . 11 . Vital sign pulse oximetry monitor every 15 minute 30 minute discontinuation Definity . 12 . A urine dipstick perform study team 30 minute completion Definity infusion sample available . Constant load Exercise protocol 13 . Subjects complete 30 minute continuous cycle power output associate 85 % VO2peak continuous bicycle ergometer protocol . Metabolic data collect described . 14 . Once metabolic parameter reach , exercise stop subject ask lie bed Renal Blood flow measurement follow exercise use contrast enhance ultrasonography 15 . Immediately completion exercise protocol , step 5 - 12 day 2 procedure repeat . 16 . The study procedure end point .</detailed_description>
