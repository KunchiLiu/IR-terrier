	<brief_summary>The overall goal proposal enhance support resource available patient diabetes assist achieve health goal . The investigator evaluate innovative program use nurse health coaching , motivational interviewing technique , wireless sensor mobile health ( mHealth ) technology . In program , patient receive timely , tailor nurse coach feedback facilitate behavior change use mHealth technology , thus bridge bidirectional exchange meaningful information among patient , nurse coach provider . The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial among patient receive chronic disease management University California , Davis Primary Care Network . The patient eligible inclusion study randomize one two arm trial : 1 ) Usual care ( Care Coordination ) administer UC Davis Health Management Education ; 2 ) Patient Provider Engagement Empowerment Technology ( P2E2T2 ) Program Improve Health Diabetes . The hypothesis patient P2E2T2 arm study engage identify achieve health goal relate diabetes achieve good health outcome compare patient receive usual care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) grow public health problem highly amenable prevention health promotion intervention . Over 26 million people diagnosed diabetes , estimate 79 million people pre-diabetes ( 1 ) . Physical inactivity , poor eat habit , obesity smoking common risk factor multiple chronic disease , include DM , associated premature death United States ( 2 ) . Traditional intervention diabetes emphasize education typically address patient-generated health data ( 3 ) . MI counsel tool improve self-efficacy support behavioral change use successfully treatment addiction chronic condition include diabetes ( 4-6 ) . MI focus enhance goal-setting skill encouraging focus manageable step improve overall health , establish reasonable goal , manage barrier obstacle goal attainment . Mobile health ( mHealth ) technology use allow bi-directional , timely communication data tailor feedback patient health care team ; thus mHealth potential change individual ' health behavior prevent factor lead disease ( 7 ) . This proposal test effectiveness nurse coach mHealth platform resource patient . Specifically , investigator test mobile technology-enabled nurse coach intervention mean engage empower patient set personal goal address lifestyle behavioral change well manage diabetes comorbidities . The addition wireless sense wearable device monitor participant activity ( physical activity , energy expenditure sleep quality ) allow investigator perform meaningful analysis patient-generated health data provide tailor feedback motivate patient reach personal goal . The investigator achieve project follow Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 : To evaluate effectiveness P2E2T2 program diabetes management measure follow outcome : 1 ) quality life ( QOL ) ; 2 ) self-efficacy ; 3 ) readiness change ; 4 ) clinically relevant outcome . Specific Aim 2 : Compare specific health fitness outcome individual participate study arm . This study randomize , control trial two group : 1 ) Usual care ( Care Coordination ) ; 2 ) Patient Provider Engagement Empowerment Through Technology ( P2E2T2 ) program - nurse coaching pair mobile sensor technology provide target feedback patient-generated , real-world community physical activity sleep quality data nurse coach , participant , primary care provider improve self-management diabetes . Participants recruit UC Davis Primary Care Clinics network . After enrollment study , randomize receive intervention interact nurse coach mobile technology telephone , face-to-face videoconference , text/e-mail secure mHealth dashboard platform establish communication transfer data . The investigator expect enroll least 150 patient intervention control arm . This sample size sufficient detect difference two group . Even conservative assumption design effect dropout rate may result reduced sample size 100 per treatment group , study still least 80 % power detect specify clinically important effect size . Based previous study nurse coach use MI improve disease self-management ( 8 ) , investigator find improvement self-efficacy score significantly high intervention group compare control group . Data collect participant three time point : 1 ) baseline data time recruitment ; 2 ) 3 month ( coincide program completion ) ; 3 ) 9 month ( select ass sustain effect intervention ) . At baseline , addition outcome , participant complete demographic survey include age , gender , race/ethnicity , education level , income level insurance type health history use Charlson Comorbidity Index include common chronic condition . All data study collect research coordinator enter REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) system house server manage UC Davis Clinical Translational Science Center ( CTSC ) ( 9 ) .</detailed_description>
