	<brief_summary>The purpose study see educational intervention provide pregnant woman early labor effect decision use epidural anesthesia relief labor pain . The study also investigate difference Hispanic non-Hispanic white woman attitude beliefs regard epidural labor . Previous study show Hispanic woman receive epidural anesthesia labor much less frequently non-Hispanic white counterpart . The investigator hypothesize rate epidural use high subject receive educational intervention . Women admit OHSU labor delivery unit screen study eligibility . In order minimize influence socioeconomic factor , woman receive Medicaid enrol . Other inclusion criterion include age least 18 year , fetus least 24 week gestational age , categorized American Society Anesthesiologist category 1 3 . Exclusion criterion include condition either excludes mandate neuraxial anesthesia . Midwife patient also exclude study . Those meet study criterion approach member study team inform consent obtain . Subjects randomly assign receive educational intervention epidural educational intervention . Hispanic non-Hispanic subject randomize separately , yield four study group ( Hispanic - intervention ; Hispanic - control ; non-Hispanic - intervention , non-Hispanic - control ) . The investigator expect enroll approximately 176 woman , 44 group . All subject complete survey early labor 1 2 day postpartum ask common beliefs misconception regard epidural . Subjects intervention group receive educational pamphlet watch video native language ( spanish english ) epidural , opportunity ask question . Study staff collect limited information subject 's labor delivery electronic medical record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Culturally Sensitive Educational Intervention Acceptance Neuraxial Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This study design prospective , single-blinded , randomize control trial Oregon Health Science University ( OHSU ) Portland , Oregon . The investigator enroll Hispanic non-Hispanic parturients equal number labor delivery floor receive educational pamphlet video primary language educational intervention . All parturients receive standard practice consent general/regional anesthesia anesthesiology resident attend . Study Population A total 176 participant enrol study . Within 176 participant four group patient : ( 1 ) Hispanic subject receive additional epidural education [ 44 patient ] , ( 2 ) Hispanic subject receive standard care [ 44 patient ] , ( 3 ) non-Hispanic subject receive additional epidural education [ 44 patient ] , ( 4 ) non-Hispanic subject receive standard care [ 44 patient ] . Over past year 421 Hispanic 215 non-Hispanic patient Medicaid insurance deliver OHSU . The rate-limiting step study enrol enough non-Hispanic subject Medicaid study timeline calculation base upon expect enrollment subject . Assuming 15 % patient approach decline study participation research team miss another 35 % patient investigator believe enroll necessary 88 subject 300 day approximately 10 month ( time 177 non-Hispanic Medicaid delivery would occur ) . Patients appropriate inclusion study identify OHSU admit labor delivery unit . A cursory review labor delivery unit census EPIC use identify qualify patient ( ASA I-III category patient 18 year age Medicaid either labor commit labor via induction ) . All patient pass initial screen thorough review record particular attention pay ethnicity medical condition would affect decision offer neuraxial analgesia . Setting Informed consent , Initial Encounter survey , Epidural Pre-Test Questionnaire administer OHSU Labor Delivery Unit . The Epidural Post-Test Questionnaire administer patient 's recovery room 1-2 day give birth . Recruitment Methods Patients appear meet inclusion criterion identify OHSU admit labor delivery unit . A cursory review EPIC work computer researcher labor delivery unit computer use identify patient warrant deep chart review ( ASA I-III category patient least 18 year Medicaid either labor commit labor via induction ) . All patient pass initial screen thorough review medical record particular attention pay ethnicity , whether MD midwife patient , medical condition may affect decision offer neuraxial anesthesia . All patient pass EPIC screen approach research team allow participate study . There flier , advertisement , video , webpage set recruit patient . There monetary award free service offer study participant . Consent Process A member research team perform subject recruitment obtain write informed consent OHSU Labor Delivery Unit order minimize possibility coercion . Patients provide Consent Authorization form preferred language ( English Spanish ) opportunity ask question research team member study protocol explain . An interpreter/translator available via telephone Spanish speak woman time . Procedures Subject allocation occur labor room inform consent occur . Allocation occur research assistant open one series sequentially numbered opaque envelope contain group assignment ( computer generate random number sequence [ Excel , Redmond WA ] . A researcher involve either subject enrollment subject assignment generate random number sequence . The anesthesia obstetric team care subject remain blind whether subject receive additional educational material ; however , due type study impossible blind subject . Subjects allocate either epidural-focused educational intervention intervention ethnicity stratify block randomization . Subjects agree participate study demographic data collect EPIC ( age , race , gravida , parity , gestational age , BMI , birth history ) give subject questionnaire primary language ask potential confounders may affect epidural usage ( high education achieve , length time subject 's family live U.S. , past personal family experience epidural , needle phobia , etc. ) . At conclusion study additional information take EPIC ( length labor , type delivery , APGAR score , whether epidural use labor analgesia ) . All subject enrol study give survey primary language seek identify potential barrier neuraxial anesthesia utilization . Included survey yes/no checklist subject complete include previously publish reason patient commonly give want neuraxial anesthesia . This survey give postpartum period woman enrol study . The postpartum survey serve post-test evaluate effectiveness educational intervention woman receive additional education material . The post-test also give woman control group determine process deliver baby either without epidural affect subject view neuraxial anesthesia . The completion posttest mark end parturient 's time participation study . All woman allocate receive additional educational material give language appropriate pamphlet video neuraxial anesthesia . The video pamphlet subject 's primary language . After subject watch educational video give opportunity go pamphlet research assistant ask question may . For Spanish-speaking subject occur telephone interpreter . The obstetric anesthesia provider obstetricians care subject absent educational video post-video conversation . Women elect receive neuraxial anesthesia administer procedure anesthesiology resident supervision attend anesthesiologist . A lumbar epidural catheter place initial bolus ( spinal epidural ) subject start patient-controlled epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) protocol solution 0.055 % bupivacaine 1 mcg/mL sufentanil . The initial PCEA setting subject follow : maintenance infusion rate 10 ml/hr , bolus 5 ml , lockout 15 minute , maximum 4 bolus hour . The maintenance infusion rate , bolus volume , lockout interval allow adjust deem necessary obstetric anesthesiology team . Subjects pain refractory initial PCEA setting allow get additional epidural bolus medication anesthesiology resident attend . The PCEA continue delivery slightly thereafter depend upon subject need . The PCEA allow turned help stage two push avoid maternal hypotension . Other rare complication involve neuraxial anesthesia dealt accord standard care practice . Data Analysis Sample size calculation base upon abstract present Society Maternal-Fetal Medicine . In study , 40 % woman assign additional prenatal epidural education class attend prescribe intervention . With 40 % attendance author study find 14 % difference epidural utilization rate . Subjects study randomize labor delivery hospital admission . The investigator estimate 90 % woman get assign educational intervention . Assuming epidural education effect study see abstract Kanter et al . investigator expect see 31 % increase epidural utilization . Based upon data OHSU June 2013 May 2014 current epidural rate OHSU Hispanics 45.3 % current epidural rate non-Hispanics 55.8 % . Assuming 31 % difference epidural usage Hispanic population implementation study protocol , alpha 0.05 power 80 % , 44 subject would need randomize four group . The investigator compare intervention control group within Hispanic non-Hispanic population primary outcome neuraxial anesthesia utilization use chi-squared statistic . Pre post delivery score Neuraxial Anesthesia Survey compare use Wilcoxon signed-rank test . Subject characteristic study arm compare one another chi-squared statistic Fisher 's Exact Test categorical outcome student test , non-parametric equivalent , continuous variable . A p &lt; 0.05 require reject null hypothesis difference epidural utilization rate exist receive educational intervention .</detailed_description>
