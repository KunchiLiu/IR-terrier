	<brief_summary>In conventional treatment option , B cell leukemia could treat chemotherapy drug HSCT . But chemotherapy could barely cure leukemia . And HSCT often limit lack HLA-matched donor , even patient receive HSCT still could relapse . And , chimeric antigen receptor modify T cell infusion maybe effective treatment solve problem . The investigator use 2nd CAR- T optimize hinge transmembrane domain treat patient relapse refractory B cell leukemia , include relapse case HSCT . The purpose study assess safety efficacy 2nd CAR-T cell . At time , evaluate possible clinical response use donor-derived T cell engineer CAR-T cell . Detailed Description : This study conduct assess anti-CD19-CAR-T cell safety efficacy treat patient B cell leukemia . The investigator construct 2nd CAR , CD19 target protein , 4-1BB co-stimulator . And optimized spatial conformation suitable hinge &amp; transmembrane domain sequence . The source T cell CAR-T two aspect , one autologous , donor-derived ( suitable patient receive HSCT relapse ) . The infusion dose ( 1-5 ) ×106 CAR positive T cells/kg , specific cell number depend situation individual CAR-T cell preparation .</brief_summary>

The investigator construct 2nd CAR , use CD19 target , use 4-1BB co-stimulator , optimize spatial conformation suitable hinge transmembrane domain sequence . The source T cell use prepare CAR-T could either autologous , donor-derived ( suitable patient receive HSCT relapse ) .
