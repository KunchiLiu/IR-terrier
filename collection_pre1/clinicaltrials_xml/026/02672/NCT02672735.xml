	<brief_summary>The occupation firefighting consider one dangerous occupation United States ( U.S. ) . As , high prevalence musculoskeletal injury ( MSKIs ) observe among firefighter population . This high rate MSKI create extremely large financial impact fire department across United States . Therefore , interest develop method identify risk develop future MSKI intervention design prevent MSKIs happen grow among firefighter population , well among researcher practitioner . Previous research demonstrate relationship MSKI alter movement pattern . In addition , researcher start demonstrate ability functional movement assessment predict future MSKI various population , include firefighter . Two functional movement assessment include Functional Movement Screen ( FMS ) Movement Efficiency ( ME ) Test , component Fusionetics Human Performance System . These assessment quantify overall functional movement quality individual create composite movement score ( i.e. , Total FMS &amp; Average ME Test score , respectively ) . In addition , various theoretical model corrective exercise programming propose . These program design restore optimal neuromuscular control correct identify neuromuscular imbalance observe movement assessment use simple easy-to-follow exercise . The Fusionetics Human Performance System utilize one model , goal improve functional movement quality individual correcting aforementioned neuromuscular deficiency observe ME Test . Based framework , corrective exercise program theoretically low risk MSKI individual well . However , currently lack research literature examine influence corrective exercise program functional movement quality among active-duty firefighter population . As , remain unknown corrective exercise intervention capable significantly improve functional movement quality among active-duty firefighter . In addition , recent research suggest various health fitness measure associate functional movement quality . These measure include total body power output , low extremity muscular strength , core muscular endurance . As , examination influence corrective exercise intervention measure health fitness among active-duty firefighter warrant .</brief_summary>
