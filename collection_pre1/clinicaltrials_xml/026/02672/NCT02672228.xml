	<detailed_description>This proof concept study evaluate feasibility vapor nanobubble technology ( MalariSense ) malaria diagnostics . The primary objective determine sensitivity MalariSense microscopy diagnose malaria malaria suspect case attend health facility The Gambia . The secondary objective include follow ; 1 . To determine sensitivity MalariSense PCR diagnose malaria malaria suspect case attend health facility The Gambia 2 . To determine specificity MalariSense diagnose malaria malaria suspect case attend health facility The Gambia . 3 . To identify factor influence diagnostic accuracy MalariSense 4 . To validate protocol blood vessel identification test ass safety prototype The study site Basse Eastern region The Gambia . The study conduct malaria transmission season ( August December 2015 ) . Participants patient suspect uncomplicated malaria present outpatient department Basse Health centre . At baseline , suspect malaria case ( clinical assessment ) ask provide inform consent transfer MRC Basse field station finger prick blood sample collect malaria rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) , microscopy filter paper subsequent molecular study . In addition , test use Malarisense Technology . Measurements take wrist , ear lobe finger tip . The laboratory prototype device include three major component : pulse laser fiber output , integrate handheld probe fiber launch center ultrasound sensor pre-amplifier , signal acquisition hardware software . The study enrol total sample size 50 patient confirm malaria . It estimate 125 167 suspect case need screened/tested get sample size . The Sample size increase 10 % allow miss value - therefore 185 suspected case screen . In addition , convenience sample 30 malaria negative participant enrol comparison malaria positive malaria negative population . RDT positive patient provide antimalarial treatment others receive treatment accord condition . Microscopy species-specific PCR perform later . Microscopy result take gold standard . There active follow . Study participant ask come back 2 day test , early notice problem .</detailed_description>
