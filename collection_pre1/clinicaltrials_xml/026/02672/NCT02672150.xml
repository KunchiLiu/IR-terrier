	<detailed_description>Background : The Juvenile Justiceâ€”Translational Research Interventions Adolescents Legal System ( JJ-TRIALS ) study cooperative implementation science initiative involve National Institute Drug Abuse , six Research Centers , Coordinating Center , Juvenile Justice Partners represent seven U.S. state . The pooling resource across Centers enables robust implementation study design involve 36 juvenile justice agency behavioral health partner agency , coproducing study protocol potential advance implementation science , meet need constituency ( fund agency , researcher , partner , study site ) , implement fidelity across cooperative challenging . Methods/design : The JJ-TRIALS primary study use head-to-head cluster randomize trial phase rollout evaluate differential effectiveness two condition ( Core Enhanced ) 36 site locate 7 state . Core strategy promote change compare Enhanced strategy incorporate core strategy plus active facilitation . Target outcomes include improvement evidence-based screening , assessment , linkage substance use treatment . Primary Research Questions : 1 . Does Core and/or Enhanced Intervention reduce unmet need increase Cascade retention relate screening , assessment , treatment initiation , engagement continue care ? 2 . Does addition Enhanced Intervention component increase percentage youth retain Cascade relative Core component ? 3 . Does addition Enhanced Intervention component improve service quality relative Core site ? 4 . Do staff perception value best practice increase time , increase pronounce Enhanced site ?</detailed_description>
