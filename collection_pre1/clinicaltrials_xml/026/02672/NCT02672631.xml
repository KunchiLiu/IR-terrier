	<detailed_description>The aim study determine whether clinical , sensory motor development correlate value obtain Electroneuromyography DTI postoperative follow patient underwent primary repair total median nerve injury . Median nerve one three major nerve hand forearm . It flexor tendon retinaculum level wrist often injured level subtotally . The primary microsurgical suture technique microscope gold standard treatment . In follow healing ; clinical examination ENMG often use . Both method subjective , although ENMG objective , however invasive method , need experienced neurologist . So , noninvasive objective new method require . In context ; difference intact , recover heal nerve tissue 's diffusion lead hypothesis ; `` The recovery repair nerve tissue monitor Diffusion Tensor Imaging method '' . There similar study literature . Ten patient operated median nerve injury 2014 enrol . In sample , correlation Tinnel Test , motor strength assessment ( Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Scale ) , static two-point discrimination test ( S2PD ) , Semmes-Weinstein ( SW ) monofilament test , Disability Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) test , EMG DTI result assess . At end study ; expect significant correlation conventional method DTI . If result support hypothesis ; DTI may get literature noninvasive objective method follow nerve regeneration .</detailed_description>
