	<brief_summary>This phase I prospective study primary objective compare efficacy safety Surgical cytoreduction ( CRS ) hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) treatment recurrent ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . Eligible patient consent protocol undergo schedule surgical procedure . After surgical cytoreduction residual disease ≤ 2.5 mm , single dose carboplatin ( 800 mg/m2 ) administer normal saline via intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion use closed-abdomen . HIPEC continue 90 minute hyperthermic phase ( 41°C-43°C ) . At 4-6 week CRS , patient go receive 6 cycle standard IV platinum-based chemotherapy . The proportion patient without evidence recurrence assess 6 , 9 , 12 18 month day surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase I prospective study primary objective compare efficacy safety CRS HIPEC . The target population study patient ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer undergo secondary CRS first platinum-sensitive recurrence . 'Platinum-sensitive ' recurrence define recurrence 6 month completion primary platinum-based chemotherapy . Carboplatin , deliver HIPEC , administer time surgery . Subjects receive single cycle hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy . Patients go receive standard platinum-based combination doublet chemotherapy ( carboplatin paclitaxel , carboplatin gemcitabine , carboplatin liposomal doxorubicin ) 6 cycle . Eligible patient consent protocol undergo schedule surgical procedure . After surgical cytoreduction residual disease ≤ 2.5 mm , single dose carboplatin ( 800 mg/m2 ) administer normal saline via intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion use closed-abdomen technique ( 43 ) . HIPEC continue 90 minute hyperthermic phase ( 41°C-43°C ) . At 4-6 week CRS , patient go receive 6 cycle standard IV platinum-based chemotherapy . Surveillance CT Chest , abdomen pelvis IV oral contrast serum CA-125 level obtain 6 , 9 , 12 18 month day surgery . Recurrence-free survival assess use RECIST 1.1 guideline ( version 1.1 ) .</detailed_description>
