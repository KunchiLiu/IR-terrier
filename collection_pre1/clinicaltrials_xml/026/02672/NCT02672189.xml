	<detailed_description>Background : Breast cancer common cancer among woman Netherlands , approximately 14.000 new case report 2011 ( 1 ) . Nearly 30 % woman breast cancer premenopausal time diagnosis ( 2 ) . Ovarian damage major long-term sequela chemotherapy premenopausal woman ( 3,4 ) . Ovarian failure induce chemotherapy and/or endocrine treatment lead early onset menopause , age duration treatment strong predictor ( 5 ) . Premature menopause major concern young woman undergo ( adjuvant/preventive ) therapy cancer ( 6 ) . Primary menopausal symptom include hot flush , night sweat , vaginal dryness , decrease libido , dysuria urinary incontinence . Secondary symptom include insomnia due night sweat , dyspareunia vaginal dryness , weight gain , psychological distress ( 3,7,8 ) . Previous study indicate severity hot flush increase woman experience transition menopause cancer treatment PBSO , compare woman go natural menopause ( 9,10,11 ) . Among menopausal symptom , hot flush consider disruptive , prevalence rate 63 % 80 % breast cancer patient ( 7,12-15 ) . Moreover , vasomotor symptom important reason woman discontinue tamoxifen treatment ( 16,17 ) . Hormonal replacement therapy ( HRT ) highly effective alleviate vasomotor symptom associate menopause ( 18 ) . However , HRT contraindicate woman history breast cancer ( 19 ) , even prophylactic bilateral salpingo oophorectomy ( PBSO ) ( 20 ) . There increase evidence behavioral intervention positive impact symptom woman naturally occur treatment-induced menopause ( 21-27 ) . A cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) intervention include information symptom , monitor modify precipitant , relaxation stress management , cognitive restructuring unhelpful assumption automatic thought , encourage helpful behavioral strategy find beneficial alleviation menopausal symptom woman breast cancer ( 25,26 ) , compliance face-to-face CBT program problematic ( 26 ) . A promising approach make form CBT accessible feasible participant available via internet . Although efficacy CBT patient population demonstrate form face-to-face group therapy , efficacy investigate delivered via internet platform individual setting . Design . For trial patient recruit several hospital Netherlands ( predominantly Amsterdam region ) . Participants randomly allocate either guide intervention group , self-management group control group ( N = 83 per group ) . Upon completion study , patient assign control group give opportunity undergo internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program . Women two intervention control group ask complete battery questionnaires prior randomization ( TO ) , 10 week ( T1 ) 6 month ( T2 ) . Study measure . The primary outcome menopausal complaint , assess menopausal complaint questionnaire , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Endocrine Symptoms ( FACT-ES ) , hot flush night sweat assess Hot Flushes Rating Scale ( HFRS ) . The secondary study outcome sexuality problem ( Sexual Activity Questionnaire ( SAQ ) ) ; sleep quality ( The Groningen Sleep Quality Score ( GSQS ) ) ; psychological distress ( The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) ) health relate quality life ( The Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short Form-36 Health Survey ( SF-36 ) ) . Patients ' evaluation intervention program . The woman intervention group ask provide opinion internet-based CBT program 10 week evaluation point . All woman ask complete short questionnaire perceive efficacy satisfaction intervention program , whether would suggest change program , would recommend woman experience symptoms premature menopause . In addition , telephone interview ( 30 minute ) hold woman : ( 1 ) state questionnaire intervention desire effect ; and/or ( 2 ) give intervention low rating ( &lt; 6 ) and/or ( 3 ) would recommend program others . Cost effectiveness . The cost-effectiveness internet-based guide CBT versus internet-based self-management CBT versus usual care express : ( 1 ) cost per patient clinically relevant significant reduction HFRS ( 2 ) cost per quality adjust life year ( QALY ) gain . Sample size statistical power calculation : In total , 248 woman recruit study , allow attrition rate approximately 20 % ( i.e. , woman discontinue participation study entirely , include failure complete follow-up questionnaire ; woman discontinue participation one group complete follow-up assessment include analysis ) . Thus , minimum 130 woman available primary intention-to-treat analysis . With total sample 130 woman ( 65 per group ) , study 80 % power detect effect size 0.5 p value 0.05 ( 28 ) . Statistical analysis : Analyses first perform evaluate comparability intervention group ( guide versus self-management ) control group baseline term sociodemographic clinical characteristic . ANOVA test appropriate non-parametric statistic use , depend level measurement . If , despite stratify randomization procedure , group find comparable one background variable , variable employ routinely covariates subsequent analysis . We evaluate between-group difference time self-reported endocrine symptom , sexual functioning , psychological distress , sleep quality HRQOL . Scores FACT-ES , HFRS , SAQ , HADS , GSQS , SF-36 utility version SF-36 , SF-6D calculate accord publish score algorithms.We compare intervention group control group time use multilevel procedure repeat measure , use restrict maximum likelihood ( REML ) solution model specific contrast group follow-up assessment ( 29 ) . Within multilevel model control group reference category . Differences mean change score time intervention group control group accompany effect size ( ES ) . As indicated previously , FACT-ES HFRS use primary study endpoint , remain measure consider secondary endpoint . The p-value overall model effect set 0.05 , specific contrast 0.01 , lower risk Type error due multiple testing . All analysis conduct intention-to-treat ( ITT ) basis . In addition , per-protocol ( PP ) analyse performed patient meet criterion minimal compliance intervention ( ) . Supplementary analysis carry data relate compliance program element take account . Specifically , determine whether level compliance ( base complete homework assignment self-report data ) associate significantly change time symptom relief , sexuality , psychological distress , sleep quality , cost-effectiveness . In addition potential mediate effect hot flush belief behavior examine mediator analysis . A cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) perform use validate health economic model develop use EVA-Trial ( 30 ) . The analysis consider societal perspective , third-party payer perspective healthcare system perspective comparing effectiveness cost web-based CBT alleviate treatment-induced menopausal symptom versus wait list control . Effectiveness data gather trial combine cost data cost-diary hospital administration data .</detailed_description>
