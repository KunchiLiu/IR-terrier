	<brief_title>Shifting Pain Modulation From Pro-to Anti-nociceptive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Pro-nociceptive pain modulation profile ( PMP ) characterize either : ( ) decrease inhibition pain , i.e.inhibitory pro-nociceptive PMP , ( ii ) increase facilitation , i.e . facilitatory pro-nociceptive PMP , ( iii ) , i.e . dual pro-nociceptive PMP . The counterpart pro-nociceptive , i.e. , anti-nociceptive PMP , yet explore . The investigator expect individual harbor profile low risk pain acquisition , experience less intense pain . Pain modulation commonly alter pain patient toward pro-nociceptive pain modulation profile ( PMP ) , express , lab , increase facilitation and/or decrease inhibition experimental pain , clinically high pain phenotype . The propose study seek explore yet characterize mirror image pro-nociception , i.e. , situation individual exhibit reduce pain facilitation efficient pain inhibition . This domain 'anti-nociceptive ' PMP potential platform improve pain therapy prevention . Extrapolating clinical picture pro-nociception , likely 'antinociceptive ' individual express low pain phenotype , less frequent less intense pain experience , low risk acquire pain surgery trauma , , possibly , good response analgesic . The investigator would like explore whether possible shift pain modulation towards anti-nociception , order obtain possible benefit modulation profile pain-prone situation . The clinical model investigator propose address hypothesis preemptive drug treatment reduction postoperative pain . Our specific choice surgery inguinal herniorraphy . In addition acute post-operative pain , operation carry relatively high rate chronic post-operative pain ( range 10 54 % patient , report indicate towards low end range ) . Our specific aim explore , setup post operative pain inguinal herniorraphy , shift PMP pro- towards anti-nociceptive base follow test domain : ( ) Psychophysical neurophysiological data describe facilitatory inhibitory modulation capacity patient . ( ii ) Psychological data describe patient 's behavior catastrophizing , anxiety depression , pain sensitivity life orientation . ( iii ) Blood test evaluate Micro RNA regulate downstream transcription shut gene expression , order evaluate role predictor evolve chronic pain , ( v ) individual case data relate age , gender , education , socioeconomic parameter personal medical history . Subjects - Study A : One hundred forty healthy subject ( range 20-79 ; 20 subject per age decade , 10 M , 10 F ) participate first phase study aim collect normative data healthy population . - Study B : Two hundred twenty patient ( range 18-75 ) schedule inguinal herniorraphy enrol . Study design Study I - Normative data collection inhibitory excitatory pain modulation response , study healthy subject The study include one session . In session , sign informed consent , subject : ( ) fill state health questionnaire , ( ii ) record 5 minute rest state EEG , ( iii ) undergo short familiarization various stimulation modality . Thereafter , along session subject fill pain related personality questionnaire ( anxiety depression , catastrophizing , pain sensitivity , life orientation test ten item personality measure ) follow psychophysical assessment , include assessment condition pain modulation ( CPM ) temporal pain summation ( TS ) describe later . A sample 20 ml blood drawn subject end session . Study II - Herniorraphy surgery patient This study randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , three parallel arm non-crossover longitudinal study four group patient identify PMPs . The study consist two assessment session : first 1 2 week surgery second 3 month surgery . The session conduct experienced experimenter , include psychophysical psychological assessment Study I ; sign informed consent , patient undergo short familiarization various stimulation modality undergo various stimulus . At end session patient assign one four group : ( ) dual pro-nociceptive , ( ii ) inhibitory pro-nociceptive , ( iii ) facilitatory pro-nociceptive , ( iv ) anti-nociceptive . 45 patient assign group , order recruitment . Third patient group randomize Duloxetine ( DUL ) , third Pregabalin ( PGB ) third Placebo ( PLA ) . Each group receive two treatment dos drug surgery , i.e . one even one morning surgery . Patients undergo surgery , perform one team surgeon , standardize protocol general anesthesia . After surgery patient treat standardized analgesic protocol discharge , normally morning surgery . Acute pain intensity analgesic consumption first 24 hour record . On post-operative day ( POD ) 1 patient fill `` patient outcome questionnaire '' include information perceive post-operative pain intensity extent pain interference activity effect mood anxiety . A periodic phone call chronic postoperative pain pursue 1 , 2 , 4 week 6 month surgery . An experimenter blind psycho-physical group assignment , follow pain state surgery . Two sample 20 ml blood drawn patient ; first blood withdrawal do surgery , second clinic visit 3 6 month surgery .</detailed_description>
