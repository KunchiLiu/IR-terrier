	<brief_summary>Over 20 million people North America ( include 2 million Canadians ) chronic kidney disease . These individual die disease heart blood vessel often need dialysis . This due hardening artery cause calcium deposit inside blood vessel wall . These deposit damage vessel , cause lose flexibility . This make unable respond change demand body , eventually lead blockage stroke ultimately death . High level phosphate blood consistently link development calcium deposit inside blood vessel wall . The kidney organ body eliminate phosphate require body . As kidney function become bad , body level phosphate increase . However , investigator know time point course kidney disease problem begin way phosphate eliminate urine kidney . Investigators test response kidney phosphate challenge take mouth subject accurate measure kidney function perform method call 'inulin clearance ' . The investigator believe result study provide important information identify investigator concern body level phosphate increase . This information may lead change way investigator treat patient reduce level phosphate diet much early time point presently recommend .</brief_summary>
