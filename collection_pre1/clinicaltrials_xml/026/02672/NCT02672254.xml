	<brief_title>New Strategies Against Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( cSCC ) account 20 % common skin malignancy , i.e . non-melanoma skin cancer . cSCC consider one public health problem high cost treatment cSCC increase due high sun exposure , well efficient dermatological examination . In addition , kind skin cancer characterize relatively high risk metastasis . The gold standard treatment local invasive cSCC base surgical excision , lead 5-years control rate low-risk patient 96 % . Nevertheless , surgery local invasive cSCC always option consequence age and/or poor health status patient . Therefore , ionize radiation use either primary adjuvant therapy cSCC elderly patient surgery would extremely invasive . Although radiotherapy seem promise option , need improved order damage locally tumor area , thus avoid damage secondary effect healthy tissue . Typical skin radiation source base superficial , orthovoltage X-rays ( XR ) beam , well electron-beam therapy . In particular , irradiation local invasive cSCC use superficial XR source kilovoltage ( kV ) energy permit local dose deposition within tumor volume , significant small penetration capacity respect higher-energy XR source . Therefore , kV XR source become perfect tool treatment superficial lesion , cSCC . The combination keV-energy photon metallic atom localize tumor would enhance dose deposit locally target , improve thus therapeutic index treatment . Among chemotherapeutic option available , platinum-based agent , cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II ) ( cisplatin cisPt ) become essential anti-cancer drug substantial therapeutic impact carcinomas-like tumor . The distortion structure DNA duplex , convert cisPt highly toxic agent per se influence DNA replication , apoptotic death , inhibition major nuclear repair pathway cisPt-DNA adduct radiation-induced DNA break . However , dose administration key limitation due high toxicity agent . It reason low cisPt concentration use study , expect effectiveness cisPt cSCC cell enhance subsequent low-energy XR irradiation attempt explore new therapeutic strategy local invasive cSCC .</detailed_description>
