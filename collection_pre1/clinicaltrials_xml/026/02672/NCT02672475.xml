	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose Galunisertib give together paclitaxel treat patient androgen receptor negative triple negative breast cancer spread place body . Some tumor need growth factor , make body 's white blood cell , keep grow . Galunisertib may interfere growth factor help cause tumor cell die . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving Galunisertib together paclitaxel may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Galunisertib Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Metastatic Androgen Receptor Negative ( AR- ) Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability paclitaxel administer LY2157299 ( Galunisertib ) . II . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) paclitaxel + LY2157299 . III . To determine recommend dose paclitaxel LY2157299 phase II study . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy , measure median progression free survival ( PFS ) , paclitaxel + LY2157299 patient metastatic androgen receptor negative triple negative metastatic breast cancer . II . To evaluate efficacy , measure clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) , paclitaxel + LY2157299 patient androgen receptor negative metastatic triple negative metastatic breast cancer . III . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) paclitaxel + LY2157299 patient androgen receptor negative metastatic triple negative breast cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To interrogate entire cod sequence 236 cancer-related gene ( 3,769 exon ) plus 47 intron 19 gene often rearrange altered cancer . II . Nanostring analysis establish gene expression signature . III . Determine breast cancer subtype PAM50 test correlate response . IV . To measure change circulate plasma transform growth factor beta 1 ( TGFB1 ) , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , cluster differentiation 34 ( CD34 ) positive ( + ) , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) induce LY2157299 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study Galunisertib . Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients also receive Galunisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
