	<detailed_description>The question evolve memory improvement standardized meditation program 8 week ( Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction MBSR ) specific memory training ( My Brain Training MBT ) specific effect brain networking mediate reduced general activity induce stress reduction . The capacity MBSR induce dramatic neuroplastic change morphological grey matter change brain , reduce amygdala function volume well electric activity level somatosensory cortex allow discrimination allocation various memorial subfunctions visual/figural episodic well acoustic memory . Although networking effect surely involved memory subfunctions , main brain target region verbal/episodic memory hippocampus ( memory malfunction associate hippocampal volume reduction and/or neuron loss ) whereas subfunctions know . Therefore , morphological MBSR effect brain compare specific memory training via MBT . In study , MBSR MBT memory train work competitive effect memory subfunctions , whereas wellness massage relaxing program do-not-change-anything group serve active passive control . The effect memory function improvement respective training measure MAT ( Memory Attention Test ) , specific validate computerized memory attention test . Brain morphology investigate voxel base morphometry NMR immediately 8 week intervention period . Targets morphometry hippocampus CA1 region verbal episodic memory , visual acoustic cortex combine hippocampus area visual acoustic memory , amygdala volume stress level frontotemporal lobe combine target MBSR memory assessment . Stress level measure cortisol profile subject . Compared 4 groups- `` MBSR '' group- MBSR student complete training , passive `` control '' group- subject follow 8 week wait period MBSR training without memory training wellness program , active control `` MBT '' group- subject 8 week wait period MBSR training 8 week MBT memory training instead , `` Wellness '' group - structure program use relax massage calm computerized chair ( `` Brain Light '' ) . The hypothesis study MBSR improve memory function well MBT measure MAT . Compared active passive control , MBSR training induces specific morphologic change brain , indicated volume change voxel base morphometry method 5 % define brain region . In comparison small less neuroplasticity induce MBT memory brain region , MBSR induce great volume change hippocampus amygdala stress reduction wellness progam .</detailed_description>
