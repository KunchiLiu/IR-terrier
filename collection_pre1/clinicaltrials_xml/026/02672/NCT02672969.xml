	<brief_title>The Evaluation Pre-Post Smoke Evacuation Uses Surgical Smoke Bio-Aerosols Operating Rooms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Project Smoke bio-aerosols routinely produce surgical instrument ; eg , laser , electrosurgical unit , radiofrequency device , ultrasonic device , power tool . Plume bio-aerosols contain odor-causing odorless toxic gas , vapor , dead live cellular debris ( include blood fragment ) , virus . These airborne contaminant pose respiratory , ocular , dermatological health-related risk , include mutagenic carcinogenic potential , patient operate room personnel . The National Institute Occupational Safety Health ( NIOSH ) Center Disease Control ( CDC ) also study electrosurgical smoke length . Therefore , equipment smoke evacuation OR need use . Therefore , study aim evaluate pre-post smoke evacuation use surgical smoke bio-aerosols particle operate room university hospital , Thailand . Methodology Association periOperative Registered Nurses ( AORN ) guideline use conceptual framework study include evidence base practice smoke bio-aerosols evacuation system . The study design quasi-experimental study ( manipulation control , without randomization ) comparing amount surgical smoke bio-aerosols particle pre- post smoke evacuation use . The sample consist 64 case surgical patient receive head-neck breast surgery 64 case surgical patient receive abdominal laparoscopic surgery . The amount surgical smoke bio-aerosols ' particle surgical field OR environment measure AeroTraxTM Handheld Airborne Particle Counter Model 9306 .</detailed_description>
