	<brief_summary>The aim project study role minimally invasive image method , magnification endoscopy narrow-band imaging ( M-NBI ) combine confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) , correlation immunohistochemical analysis , assess angiogenesis status patient gastrointestinal tumor , particular colorectal gastric cancer . Angiogenesis , i.e . process form new blood vessel , represent essential event tumor growth metastasis importance understand stem potential application diagnosis , prognosis stratification mainly possibility develop improve target therapy . While current method evaluate tumor vascularity base immunohistochemistry technique microvascular density ( MVD ) calculation , imply repeat tissue sample feasible context clinical practice . Imaging technique might overcome limitation associate MDV measuring , obtain functional morphological information enable repeat evaluation necessary assessment dynamic process angiogenesis follow-up targeted therapy . NBI digitally enhance endoscopic imaging technique use optical filter illuminate tissue light blue green wavelength . These selectively absorbed hemoglobin , result superficial vascular network highlight morphological change capillary pattern describe different lesion . CLE represent revolutionary technology enables endoscopists collect real-time vivo histological image `` virtual biopsy '' gastrointestinal mucosa endoscopy , raise significant interest potential clinical application numerous research possibility . After intravenous administration fluorescein contrast agent , CLE enable real-time visualization tumor vasculature , structurally functionally alter compare normal vascular network . Therefore M-NBI use enhanced visualization morphological change superficial capillary , CLE direct towards vascular region interest characterization change microscopic level . Furthermore , image study back MVD calculation use immunohistochemical method , base tissue sample harvest endoscopic procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The key objective project : - Real-time imaging angiogenesis GI tumor use minimally invasive method : - Endoscopic magnification narrow-band image ( M-NBI ) macroscopic assessment vascular pattern - In vivo probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) characterization microvascular pattern - Offline analysis M-NBI pCLE sequence additional image processing software - Immunohistochemical evaluation angiogenesis GI cancer base MVD calculation - Comparing imaging ( M-NBI pCLE ) pathological ( immunohistochemistry ) data use computer aid diagnosis ( CAD ) The study include patient gastric ( n=20 ) colorectal ( n=30 ) cancer prospectively evaluate accord predefined protocol . Magnification endoscopy narrow band imaging ( M-NBI ) perform patient identification lesion conventional white light endoscopy . With push button optical filter apply reduce illuminate light 415 nm ( blue ) 540 nm ( green ) wavelength enhance visualization capillary change . Classification vascular pattern make on-site examiner ( DIR ) multiple image save off-site late analysis . While interpretation endoscopic image subjective operator-dependent also perform objective evaluation computer-aided analysis base image processing software . A vascular region interest select NBI mode target microscopic examination pCLE tissue sample pathology IHC assessment . M-NBI examination also perform normal mucosa comparative analysis vascular pattern . Confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) perform visualization characterization vascular change inside tumor , use probe-based CLE system ( pCLE ) . The fast image acquisition rate pCLE system ( 12 frame per second ) enable direct vivo visualization blood flow . The main advantage pCLE system easily integrated image protocol flexible catheter probe pass work channel endoscopes vascular area interest select M-NBI . For pCLE examination use fluorescein contrast agent already approve vivo human examination . Fluorescein administer intravenously , highlight vessel surround epithelial structure . The vascular pattern assess real-time well off-site base objective measurement store sequence include different vascular parameter ( vessel diameter , vascular density ) . These determined tumor tissue normal adjacent mucosa control , use dedicate software . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) analysis MVD calculation assess correlated imaging finding . Paired biopsies tumor normal GI mucosa obtain endoscopic procedure ( ensure co-registration M-NBI pCLE examine region ) process fixation 10 % neutral buffer formalin ( NBF ) , paraffin embed sectioning . For MVD analysis , block completely cut serial section 4-25 Î¼m-thick , one thick section every 10 thin section . In order ass total vascular architecture utilize non-selective endothelial cell marker , anti-CD31 anti-CD34 antibody .</detailed_description>
