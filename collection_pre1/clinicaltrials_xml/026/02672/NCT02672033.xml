	<brief_summary>This pilot phase 0 trial study accelerate hypofractionated radiation therapy immediately surgery treat patient malignant pleural mesothelioma ( cancer thin layer tissue cover lung line interior wall chest cavity ) . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Hypofractionated radiation therapy type radiation therapy total prescribe dose radiation divide few large dos compare conventional radiation therapy . Giving accelerate hypofractionated radiation therapy immediately surgery may improve survival , may also reduce side effect experience patient pleural mesothelioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accelerated Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Immediately Before Surgery Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility toxicity ( acute chronic ) accelerate hypofractionated neoadjuvant helical intensity modulate radiation therapy prior pleurectomy/decortication malignant pleural mesothelioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) . II . To determine tumor local control rate ( LC ) . III . To determine malignant pleural mesothelioma disease specific survival ( DSS ) . IV . To determine overall survival ( OS ) . V. To assess transform growth factor beta ( TGF-B ) , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 level predictive biomarkers treatment induce tissue injury . VI . To assess change postoperative pleural immunological milieu term chemo- cytokine expression . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 5 fraction accelerate hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) 1 week simultaneous integrate boost gross disease . Patients undergo pleurectomy/decortication within 14 day completion IMRT . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week , every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
