	<detailed_description>Very little currently know patient peripheral neuropathy develop neuropathic pain , whilst others . It anticipate study begin identify feature peripheral neuropathy , , associate development intensity neuropathic pain therefore begin elucidate factor , underlie pain . We also compare finding neuropathy result diverse aetiology include diabetes , HIV idiopathic axonal neuropathy order investigate , whether difference pain symptomatology , NCS , QST , pattern evoked brain activity small fibre dysfunction different context . We would like answer follow question : 'In patient suffer peripheral neuropathy relationship pain symptomatology peripheral sensory dysfunction , intraepidermal nerve fibre density ( IENFD ) psychological , circadian rhythm co-morbidity well everyday functionality ? 1.2.1 Quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) neuropathic pain . Nerve conduction study ( NCS ) predominantly assess large fibre function indeed context small fibre neuropathy often normal . We propose assess utility two relatively non-invasive tool , routinely use , practice elsewhere , assess small fibre dysfunction : quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) intraepidermal nerve fibre density ( IENFD ) . There study examine context neuropathy , exact relationship measure abnormality pain , quality life psychological state largely unknown . QST method accurately determine sensory threshold human skin particularly useful determine dysfunction nociceptive small diameter nerve fibre , although precise utility QST routine clinical neuropathic pain management perhaps require evaluation . There also increase interest use QST combination assessment pain descriptor give insight underlie pathophysiological mechanism chronic pain . For example , presence brush evoke dynamic allodynia indicate sensitisation spinal level . Although QST widely use assessment tool small fibre function sensory phenotype neuropathy associate pain often certain individual component measure ( e.g . thermal vibration threshold oppose full battery test require give complete sensory assessment ) . Previous study also suggest patient painful neuropathy may also display hyperalgesia mechanical thermal suprathreshold stimulus , however study contain relatively small number subject . We therefore characterise phenomenon conduct additional suprathreshold mechanical thermal stimulus accord method previously describe , addition standard German Neuropathic Pain Network QST protocol , also include variation ambient temperature ( range 10 35 °C ) ass characteristic related sensory test eventually change . 1.2.2 Intra-epidermal nerve fibre density ( IENFD ) neuropathic pain . Measurement IENFD relatively simple assay perform relatively innocuous 3mm punch biopsy skin , routine dermatological investigation . Its utility assessment small fibre function peripheral neuropathy clear . Peripheral neuropathy diverse aetiology associate reduce epidermal innervation density however exact relationship reduction pain pain co-morbidities require proper evaluation . Residual skin tissue store compliance The Human Tissue Act , biochemical analysis . 1.2.3 Nerve Conduction Studies Axon Reflex Neuropathic Pain Characteristically , different type peripheral neuropathy exhibit pattern demyelination axonopathy large fibre . The rationale procedure study discard pathology may account main etiology cause pain context peripheral neuropathy . Guillain-Barre Syndrome , Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy , Vasculitic Neuropathies others account neuropathy pain allow u make sample homogeneous . Nerve conduction study usually safe procedure indemnity axon myelin sheath test use external electrical stimulus . As part protocol test . As part study , Electromyography ( EMG ) include either . If NCS perform part patient routine medical care result record . As mean assess physiological integrity C fiber patient suffer carpal tunnel syndrome elicit axon reflex . This reflex involve transcutaneous application agent histamine via iontophoresis ( electrical current ) . The histamine stimulate peripheral nerve ending small diameter C fibre . Their stimulation induces vasodilatation , visible flare response skin . The evaluation extent flare response use indication integrity small diameter C fibre population . 1.2.4 Psychological co-morbidity , quality life neuropathic pain Whilst study examine aspect pain context peripheral neuropathy , go beyond simple measurement pain intensity sensory characteristic limited literature explore interaction pain , psychological status quality life . Neuropathic pain general associate multiple psychological problem impact upon quality life . These include circadian rhythm disturbance ( e.g . sleep difficulty : moderate severe 60 % patient ) , lack energy ( 55 % ) , drowsiness ( 39 % ) difficulty concentration ( 36 % ) ; similar finding specifically document diabetic neuropathy . Severe moderate depression anxiety also occur 30 % neuropathic pain patient . In general , beliefs fear concern pain implication contribute substantially determine mood behaviour . Since neuropathic pain relatively common context peripheral neuropathy question arises extent pain driver co-morbidities - answer know , large randomise controlled trial analgesic intervention neuropathic pain state indicate pain intensity reduce severity co-morbidities . To answer question first need identify specific tool measurement neuropathic pain co-morbidity context peripheral neuropathy one aim proposal evaluate variety exist assessment tool . Another issue likely psychological co-morbidity influence self report pain intensity , usual primary outcome measure clinical trial neuropathic pain analgesic agent . We use battery psychological instrument determine psychological quality life subject peripheral neuropathy identify difference suffer neuropathic pain . We also attempt validate number neuropathy screen assessment tool ; Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen ( BPNS ) Utah Early Neuropathy Scale ( UENS ) . The BPNS UENS tool previously evaluate context HIV diabetic neuropathy respectively , however study would provide additional invaluable information light QST IENFD finding context axonal polyneuropathy result diverse aetiology . 1.2.4 Blood sample We collect blood sample ( 30mls ) subject , store -80C lock freezer . This couple detailed phenotype data collect , inform study investigate potential genetic association development neuropathic pain . A serum sample also store consideration future biomarker study . 1.2.5 Imaging human brain activity subset PINS participants The advent functional imaging technique allow researcher begin look within human brain observe pain look like brain . Initially , pain image research determine pain process single brain region instead engage several distributed cortical area . The group brain region active pain commonly refer 'pain matrix ' . This include : primary secondary somatosensory cortex ( SI , SII ) , insular , anterior cingulate , prefrontal cortex thalamus . However , pain purely sensory event also reflective person feel pain . Factors vary widely across population memory , emotion , pathology , genetics , cognitive factor directly affect individual experience pain . Because , pain matrix provide incomplete picture happen brain pain . Pain imaging study begin validate perspective . For example , Derbyshire et al . show activation key pain matrix region even subject pain . From study look chronic pain sufferer , Baliki et al . show series key brain region active outside pain matrix . It essential brain image research update notion 'pain matrix ' account inconsistency . Therefore , study would like see area brain activate peripheral marker polyneuropathy target range noxious non-noxious stimulation , determine key brain region involve pain processing .</detailed_description>

And patient symptom highly suggestive neuropathy judgement clinical researcher suitable study even fulfill inclusion criterion . Patients fulfill exclusion criterion . Subjects pregnant . Subjects insufficient command English obtain consent complete study questionnaire . Subjects insufficient mental capacity obtain consent complete study questionnaire . Subjects concurrent severe psychological psychiatric disorder . Patients moderate severe pain form cause may confound assessment reporting pain ( eg . spinal canal stenosis ) .
