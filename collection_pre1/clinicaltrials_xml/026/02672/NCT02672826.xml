	<brief_summary>The endothelium key barrier blood tissue compartment . It major target factor involve metabolic cardiovascular pathology . However , study native human adult endothelial cell difficult due lack appropriate model thereafter endothelium actually easily accessible clinical investigation . However , result recently show endothelium human adipose tissue exhibit distinct phenotype , include endothelial cell number inflammatory , angiogenic senescent state , accord adipose tissue location , i.e . subcutaneous visceral . It well recognize estrogen favour gluteo-femoral adipose tissue deposit deficit menopause associate increase abdominal visceral fat mass well metabolic dysfunction . These perturbation might prevent hormonal therapy . However , data available concern endothelial cell gluteo-femoral abdominal adipose tissue woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The adipose tissue ( gluteo-femoral abdominal ) obtain woman program surgery estrogenic status well adipose tissue mass profile evaluate . The phenotype ( inflammatory angiogenic activation senescent state ) native endothelial cell determine `` situ '' immunohistochemical flow cytometry approach isolate endothelial cell Reverse transcriptase-Q Polymerase Chain Reaction Western blot . In vitro approach perform 1 ) establish causal relationship endothelial senescence activation state , 2 ) define impact adipose tissue microenvironment endothelial cell activation senescence 3 ) study potential protective effect estrogens endothelial senescence .</detailed_description>
