	<brief_summary>Despite great stride , hypertension remain incredibly important disease public health problem . This study address critical need among ED patient , unique population patient ( ) likely benefit antihypertensive adherence intervention due high prevalence uncontrolled blood pressure poor adherence , ( b ) high risk poor cardiovascular outcome . The protocol provide multicomponent intervention bundle test among ED patient . Successful clinic-based behavioral intervention generally target combination barrier adherence ; bundle intervention show success wide range setting disease . In case , bundle component necessary achieve blood pressure benefit primary care set ; isolate educational effort mixed success ED .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A ED-based Intervention Improve Antihypertensive Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 37 million Americans uncontrolled hypertension , associate cost $ 93.5 billion 2010 . Emergency department visit hypertension rise 25 % 2006 2011 . According Centers Disease Control Prevention , `` improved hypertension control…require [ ] expand effort increase focus blood pressure health-care system , clinician , individual . '' ED visit among patient uncontrolled blood pressure often miss opportunity ED serve additional healthcare touchpoint opportunity impact chronic disease control complement chronic care . The ED common access point healthcare system , 120 million visit annually among 20 % Americans . ED visit specifically hypertension also common , 5 million visit per year rise rapidly newly insure chronically ill patient seek ED care . Elevated blood pressure ( BP ) note 15-25 % ED visit attribute solely pain . An ED-based intervention place focus patient increase risk poor clinical outcome likely gain benefit intervention . Medication adherence , take medication prescribe , crucial BP control . Until , measure antihypertensive adherence ED limit self-report , influence recall social desirability bias lack establish patient-provider relationship . As result , little known regard factor related antihypertensive adherence optimal intervention improve adherence among ED patient . This project utilize validated mass spectrometry plasma assay measure antihypertensive adherence overcome limitation . This tool combine conceptual framework order test understand adherence relate blood pressure control among ED patient . The conceptual framework base work Krousel-Wood , Bosworth , Murray , Gellad ground Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model health behavior change , Social Cognitive Theory , successful clinic-based adherence intervention .</detailed_description>
