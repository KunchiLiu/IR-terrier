	<brief_title>A Study Allogeneic Low Oxygen Mesenchymal Bone Marrow Cells Subjects With Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain leading cause morbidity mortality despite continue advance various treatment option . In developed country , ischemic heart disease cause 50 % cardiovascular death . Stem cell transplantation potential repair improve cardiac function , thus help significantly decrease morbidity mortality rate . Preclinical data variety animal study demonstrate capacity skeletal myoblasts engraft , form myotubules , enhance cardiac function transplantation infarcted myocardium . The underlie sequela post infarcted left ventricle often include massive damage cardiomyocyte . The left ventricle remodel ( dilation ) dysfunction think irreversible . The development treatment regenerate musculature vascular component consider main therapeutic challenge . Preliminary human study focus subject ischemic heart disease demonstrate successful myoblast transplantation post infarction scar . Another study demonstrate benefit stem cell therapy ventricular function profusion . Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell use number clinical trial different indication . These clinical trial show excellent safety , reduction arrhythmia , improvement functional status increase ejection fraction . The hMSCs able : 1 . Prevent reperfusion injury ; 2 . Prevent excessive fibrosis ; 3 . Reestablish function hibernate cardiomyocytes peripheral zone area . 4 . Reestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis ; 5 . Preserve wall motion ( prevent arrhythmia functional contractile deterioration ) ; 6 . Prevent post infarct ventricular remodel leave ventricular dilation . It well accept dilate cardiomyopathy mortality rate 50 % within 5 year diagnosis ; 7 . Limit infarct size . If preserve restore cardiac function measure ejection fraction LVESV preserving leave ventricular integrity would increase subject quality life well longevity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Males females 1885 year age . 2 . First Acute Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI , non STEMI ) within 7 day study enrollment . Myocardial infarction define ECG , Lab CMR evidence . 3 . Subject successful revascularization within 12 hour symptom evidence residual stenosis &lt; 30 % TIMI antegrade flow II III culprit vessel . Revascularization may include one follow : PCI angioplasty/stenting placement Thrombolytic therapy 4 . Life expectancy great 12 month . 5 . Ability understand provide sign informed consent , designated legal guardian spouse legally able willing make decision subject 's behalf . 6 . Reasonable expectation subject receive standard post myocardial infarction care , unless contraindicate , include medication : • Anticoagulation ( e.g . aspirin , clopidogrel , ticlopidine , prasugrel , etc . ) , betablockers , ace inhibitor , statin agent , tolerate . 7 . Attend schedule safety followup visit . 1 . Hemodynamic instability demonstrate follow : Requirement intraaortic balloon pump leave ventricular assist device . Need inotropic support ( e.g . dopamine and/or dobutamine ) 36 hour maintenance mean arterial blood pressure ≥60 mmHg . 2 . History cancer within past 5 year , exception localize basal squamous cell carcinoma . 3 . Clinicallysignificant hematologic , hepatic , renal impairment within 24 hour study procedure determine screen clinical laboratory test . Severe chronic anemia hematocrit ≤24 % . Liver function test ( total bilirubin 3 time upper limit normal , creatinine level ≥3mg/dL ) . 4 . Presence clinicallysignificant medical condition , psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality , judgment Investigator Sponsor participation study would pose safety risk subject . 5 . Participation another study investigational drug device within 3 month prior stem cell administration . 6 . History within past year drug alcohol abuse . 7 . Females know pregnant , lactate positive pregnancy test ( test screening ) planning become pregnant study . 8 . Inability comply condition protocol . 9 . Presence transplant tissue organ leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) ( expectation within next 12 month ) . 10 . Planned Automatic Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator ( AICD ) CRT within next 12 month . 11 . Need chronic intermittent inotropic therapy . 12 . Active myocarditis early postpartum cardiomyopathy ( within first twelve month delivery ) . 13 . Porphyria . 14 . Allergy sodium citrate `` caine '' type local anesthetic . 15 . Subject schedule hospice care . 16 . Clinically relevant abnormal finding clinical history , physical examination , ECG ( e.g . life threaten arrhythmia , include QTc interval ≥550 m ) laboratory test screen assessment would interfere objective study would , Investigator 's opinion , preclude safe completion study . 17 . Abnormal finding could include : know HIV infection immunodeficiency state , chronic active viral infection ( hepatitis B C ) , acute systemic infection ( defined subject undergoing treatment antibiotic ) , gastrointestinal tract bleeding , severe acute concomitant illness injury . 18 . Any medical , social , geographical factor would make unlikely subject could comply study procedure ( e.g. , alcohol abuse , lack permanent residence , severe depression , disorientation , distant location , history noncompliance ) .</criteria>
