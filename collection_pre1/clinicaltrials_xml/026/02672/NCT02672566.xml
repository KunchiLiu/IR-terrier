	<detailed_description>Constituted vascular intrauterine growth restriction ( CVIG ) correlate abnormal placenta development , alteration maternal-fetal circulation , coagulation trouble , apparition placental infarct . CVIG represent third cause perinatal mortality France , associate important morbidity . For birth-weights &lt; 10th percentile gestational age , neonatal death risk double , compare abnormal weight . 35 % CVIG link vascular cause integrate placental vascular disease . Nowadays , study focus prevention , efficacy limit aspirin heparin low molecular weight ( LMWH ) . Few study evaluate treatment CVIG case . Aspirin show efficacy case pathological uterine doppler . Only one randomize study study LMWH preventive dos 14 day CVIG . In open clinical trial include 73 patient , result favor heparin group : significantly improvement growth kinetic fetus upper birth weight . These encouraging result suggest LMWH physio-pathological treatment CVIG consequently , improve intrauterine growth . However , preliminary data insufficient . Basically , CVIG support base active watch extraction case maternal fetal suffering . The primary objective evaluate efficacy enoxaparin treatment preventive dos ( 4 000 Ui/Day ) administer CVIG diagnosis birth maximum 36 week amenorrhea , decrease risk new bear weight birth &lt; 10th percentile gestational age . To answer objective , researcher propose multicentric clinical trial , randomize , open , two parallel group , compare enoxaparin subcutaneous administration preventive dos associate usual care ( group 1 ) versus usual care ( group 2 ) . The inclusion 81 patient per group schedule , mean 162 patient total . Participation patient start first consultation 1 month delivery . Inclusion time 22 month . Total duration 26 month .</detailed_description>
