	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate research question : 1 . Is difference result obtain , respiratory rate measure automatically electronic device ( SensiumVitals® system , Sensium Healthcare ) compare research assistant use criterion standard approach ? 2 . Is difference result obtain , respiratory rate measure automatically electronic device ( SensiumVitals® system , Sensium Healthcare ) compare hospital staff 's current clinical practice ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Respiratory rate among first vital sign change deterioration patient condition occur , highly useful identify high-risk patient , patient pain , risk death patient treat myocardial infarction medical patient risk cardiac arrest . Respiratory rate one seven physiological parameter include Early Warning Score ( EWS ) , aggregate track- trigger-system risk-stratification patient hospital ward risk imminent clinical deterioration . EWS include escalation protocol , define necessary ward staff call assistance vital parameter measure . Manual measurement respiratory rate standard hospital ward Capital Region Denmark . During measurement respiratory rate , patient ideally lie still refrain talk . This pose difficulty daily , clinical practice . Several study hospital ward use use EWS-system report respiratory rate often omit vital sign measure . Even respiratory rate measure regularly , poor inter-observer agreement reproducibility measure respiratory rate find . Respiratory rate record nurse report generally high measured observer use standardised approach . The EWS currently use validate use measurement obtain normal nursing practise . If element human influence measurement respiratory rate , automation could affect prognostic property EWS unpredictable way , even automatically measure respiratory rate reliably reflect patient ' physiology current clinical practise . If systematic difference recording staff electronic device currently market exists , could implication EWS score subsequently , escalation protocol patient elevate EWS could affect . If case , EWS might even re-validated use machine-measured respiratory rate . Thus , even could number advantage automate measurement respiratory rate hospital ward , due consideration require ward staff 's manual measurement respiratory rate replace measurement obtain electronic device . The purpose study evaluate systematic difference respiratory rate measurement perform electronic device ( SensiumVitals® system , Sensium Healthcare ) compare measurement perform research assistant use criterion standard approach ward staff 's usual measurement .</detailed_description>
