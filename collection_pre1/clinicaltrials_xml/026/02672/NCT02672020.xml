	<detailed_description>Malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma ( MPP ) adrenocortical carcinoma ( ACC ) two rare cancer entity unfavorable prognosis . The knowledge rare cancer improve thanks French COMETE ( 'COrtex , MEdulla Tumors Endocrines ' ) network originally base two clinical center ( HEGP Cochin ) well organize clinical biological sample collection . Over last 10 year , COMETE key partner decipher molecular mechanism tumorigenesis oncogenesis tumor identify molecular signature discriminate benign malignant cancer integrate genomic approach . COMETE publish 200 paper perform seminal work pathophysiology genetics MPP ACC publish high-impact journal . This strategy highly successful deliver new diagnostic application genomics technology appear potentially suitable rapid implementation routine clinical care . The main objective COMETE-TACTIC program design validate easy-to-use `` identity card '' classify MPP ACC clinical routine , use molecular genomic metabolomic tool combine histopathological-based test , provide real help early diagnosis , prognostic well personalize `` à la carte '' management treatment patient malignant adrenal tumor . Seven team , expertise genomics adrenal tumor , metabolomics approach , clinical research statistical analysis collaborate COMETE-TACTIC . COMETE-TACTIC base already constitute large cohort 850 patient enlarge prospective enrolment new case biological sample ( 300 450 new case 3 year project ) via 21 French expert and/or competence center COMETE-Cancer Reference center . Previous COMETE basic study provide important new insight understand molecular mechanism responsible MPP ACC . With transfer `` Omics '' -based test research laboratories clinical practice , COMETE-TACTIC next step toward personalized medicine patient MPP ACC . COMETE-TACTIC speed transfer routine clinical care new biomarkers base cutting-edge technology combine advanced pathology assessment target genomics metabolomics diagnose malignancy predict outcome , thereby facilitate accurate , rapid reliable diagnostic work-up patient . This personalized management help avoid delayed diagnosis direct clinical decision result good health outcome patient . COMETE-TACTIC offer access precise molecular classification MPP ACC guide target therapy . Finally , COMETE-TACTIC investigate first time impact circulate biomarkers diagnosis prognostic adrenal cancer test biomarkers response target therapy .</detailed_description>
