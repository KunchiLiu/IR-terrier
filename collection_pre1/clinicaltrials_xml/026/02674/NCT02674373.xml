	<brief_summary>The evaluation chemotherapy efficacy gastric cancer patient usually evaluate computer tomography scan RECIST criterion perform every two month treatment . The management treatment gastric cancer need development early biomarkers evaluate efficacy order avoid unnecessary toxicity case early chemotherapy resistance . In prospective study , compare monitor circulate tumor DNA result CT scan accord RECIST criterion blood level CEA CA 19-9 tumor marker . Thus , objective study identify prognostic and/or predictive biomarker tumor response accord tumor DNA circulate assessment gastric cancer treatment , order ( ) avoid unnecessary toxicity ineffective treatment would continue uselessly , ( ii ) allow early change alternative chemotherapy regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction The cell lysis phenomena tumor release DNA detect blood biological fluid lymph , urine stool . An increase plasma level tumor DNA describe patient cancer , recently , monitor circulate tumor DNA propose relevant potential marker ass prognosis early response treatment colon breast cancer ( Dawson et al , 2013 ; Spindler et al , 2013 ; Tie et al , 2015 ) . However , data prognostic predictive impact circulate tumor DNA context gastric cancer treatment . The aim study evaluate correlation level circulate tumor DNA prognosis response treatment localize advanced gastric cancer . Patients Methods : Three university hospital `` Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris '' ( AP-HP ) participate prospective study : European Georges Pompidou hospital , Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital Cochin hospital . Inclusion criteria patient age 18 year localize advanced adenocarcinoma gastric gastro-oesophageal junction , histologically proven . The patient enrol period 2 year receive sign specific consent information form . This non-interventional study change management patient . There additional invasive procedure already schedule routine care . Blood sample make time chemotherapy session Huber needle previously implant port-a-cath administration chemotherapy agent . The circulate tumor DNA analyze quantified sequence proton somatic genetic alteration identify tumor ( Inserm Unit 775 UMR_S , Professor Pierre Laurent-Puig ) . The data relate patient ( age diagnosis , sex , weight , height , WHO performance status ) , tumor ( tumor marker CEA CA 19-9 , date diagnosis gastric cancer , histological type tumor differentiation , tumor stage , metastatic site ) treatment ( resection primary tumor , date surgery , chemotherapy protocol ) collect anonymously . Monitoring data concern efficacy chemotherapy ( tumor response , date disease progression , survival ) , well possible date tumor recurrence death . The Statistical analysis base survival model order predict responder non-responder status , include parameter normally associate risk recurrence death . The association change circulate tumor DNA level responder non-responders perform Cox model ; DNA circulating level consider variable dependent time . An estimation 100 patient plan cohort ( localize advanced disease ) recruitment period approximately 2 year . Expected Results - For cohort patient localized tumor : loss ( decrease ) circulate tumor DNA curative treatment patient exhibit tumor recurrence ; OR loss ( increase ) circulate tumor DNA curative treatment patient tumor recurrence . - For cohort patient advanced tumor : early significant increase level circulate tumor DNA non-responders chemotherapy ; OR early significant reduction level circulate tumor DNA patient respond treatment .</detailed_description>
