	<criteria>Has histologically confirm epithelial ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer primary peritoneal cancer Has receive front line platinumbased regimen ( administer via either intravenous intraperitoneal route ) per local standard care treatment guideline follow primary interval debulking surgery document disease recurrence ( note : Maintenance treatment follow front line treatment permit count together part front line treatment ) Has fulfil follow additional requirement regard prior treatment recurrent ovarian cancer ( ROC ) depend cohort participant enrol . Each participant must document evidence clinical response disease stabilization last regimen receive . Cohort A : Has receive 0 2 additional prior line treat ROC ( 13 total prior line count front line ) must platinumfree interval ( PFI ) ≥ 3 12 month last regimen receive platinumbased , treatmentfree interval ( TFI ) ≥ 3 12 month last regimen receive nonplatinumbased Cohort B : Has receive 3 5 additional prior line treat ROC ( 46 total prior line count front line ) must PFI ≥ 3 month last regimen receive platinumbased , TFI ≥ 3 month last regimen receive nonplatinumbased Has measurable disease baseline base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 determined central image vendor Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 Has life expectancy ≥16 week Has provide tumor tissue sample either collect prior cytoreductive surgery fresh newly obtain tumor tissue screening Has adequate organ function Female participant childbearing potential must willing use adequate method contraception course study 120 day last dose study drug Is currently participate participate clinical study receive investigational agent use investigational device within 4 week prior first dose study treatment Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e. , use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior plan first dose study Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 4 week prior plan first dose study Has recover adverse event ≤ Grade 1 prior treatment level due previously administer agent Has epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) mucinous histology subtype Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment within last 5 year . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Participants previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable brain metastasis Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis Has active infection require systemic therapy Has symptom bowel obstruction past 3 month Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement study Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive child within project duration study , start screen visit 120 day last dose study drug Has receive prior therapy antiprogrammed cell death ( PD ) 1 , antiPDligand1 ( antiPDL1 ) , antiPDL2 agent agent direct another coinhibitory Tcell receptor ( e.g . cytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 [ CTLA4 ] , tumor necrosis factor receptor OX40 CD137 ) participate prior pembrolizumab ( MK3475 ) study Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Has know active Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan first dose study</criteria>
