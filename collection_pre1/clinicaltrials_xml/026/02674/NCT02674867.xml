	<brief_summary>The study aim define compare immunological characteristic ( lymphocyte subpopulation , specific immunity HIV , lymphocyte activation , inflammatory parameter ) virological characteristic ( study viral reservoir ) 2 group vertically-HIV-1-infected child , 5 17-year-of-age , start cART 6 months-of-age ( `` early treatment '' group ) 24 months-of-age ( `` late treatment '' group ) initial virologic success ( HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copy / mL reach later 24 month start cART ) , whatever later evolution viremia . Moreover , viral reservoir deeply characterize 10 child ( 5 patient group ) sustain control HIV-1 viremia cART ( ≥ 90 % HIV-1 RNA measure &lt; 400 copy /mL ) : quantification reservoir lymphocyte subpopulation study inductibility viral reservoir .</brief_summary>
