	<brief_title>Posterior Segment Intrusion Using Miniplates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventions : A . Treatment group : Medical History Questionnaire : fill patient exclude presence systemic condition . Clinical Examination : Oral structure examine ( M. N. ) include Teeth caries , fracture miss teeth gingival tissue gingivitis , periodontitis , attachment loss , gingival recession , oral lesion nature gingival biotype . The thorough intraoral examination need evaluate need referral consultation intervention initiation treatment . Diagnosis : ( M . B . ) check patient fulfill previously mention inclusion criterion . Full set record take every patient part routine procedure treatment patient outpatient clinic Orthodontic Department , Cairo University . Clinical Procedures : The clinical procedure perform accord protocol apply Sherwood et al 1 . Patients refer uptake Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) , consider ( T1 ) . CBCT scan perform patient maximum dental intercuspation next generation i-CAT CBCT unit accord manufacture instruction . During scan , patient position standardize follow ; Frankfort horizontal plane parallel floor mid sagittal plane perpendicular Frankfort horizontal plane . 2 . Banding upper first molar do follow take upper impression molar band place . A Transpalatal arch ( TPA ) fabricate 0.9 mm wire cement upper arch . Bonding posterior segment 3M bracket MBT prescription 0.022 '' slot bracket system perform . Passive arch 0.019Ã—0.025 '' stainless steel arch wire place posterior segment bilaterally 3 . Surgical procedure perform ( H . A . ) include follow : Application topical anesthesia , ULTRACARE benzocaine 20 % , local anesthesia injection site . Administration local anesthesia , Mepivacaine-l . The injection infiltrate area miniplate fix bilaterally . Proper disinfection perform local disinfectant , BETADINE povidone-iodine 10 % , area . Surgery begin 1- 2-cm vestibular incision full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap reflect expose cortical bone maxillary strut blade . 15 mount Bard Parker handle no.3 . Two long Y I shape mini plate place bilaterally zygomatic buttress area local anesthesia . The mini plat adapted fit contour underlie bone adjust terminal part upper first molar area . Drilling do use compatible sized drill mount low-speed air motor create three hole sit mini screw insert fixation mini plate . The mini plat fix three mini screw ( diameter 2 mm 10 mm length ) make titanium . In case loose mini screw upon tap , emergency screw use instead loose one ( wider diameter enhance interlock bone ) . After placement right leave miniplates , flap close use black silk ( 3/0 ) continuous suture leave extension plate perforate attached gingiva near mucogingival junction . Postoperative instruction give patient , ice pack , soft diet advise . Postoperative antibiotic ( 150g Clindamycin/tds ) 1 week , well analgesic ( Cataflam 25mg ) , prescribe post-operatively . Strict Oral hygiene instruction give patient recall 1 week procedure ensure adequate soft tissue heal . Sutures remove one week surgery . 4 . Closed coil spring insertion : Loading mini plate do three week surgery allow give sufficient time soft tissue heal . An intrusion force ( 200-300 ) gm . produce stretch closed coil spring apply measure force gauge . 5 . Follow period : The patient ask attend follow-up visit every 4 week check follow : ( M. B. , F.H. , M. N. ) The stability mini plat The integrity appliances The activity appliance The amount correction achieve Any inflammation relate appliance mini plat 6 . Appliance activation : The appliance activate every 4 week ( M. N. ) 7 . The patient group ask mark degree pain ( VAS ) visual analogue scale regard experience treatment phase . 8 . Termination intervention : ( The end point ) - Reaching adequate overbite inter-labial gap 6 month start intervention - Patient request - Poor oral hygiene - Abnormal side effect severe inflammation 9 . Post-intrusion : A second record image order criterion parameter previously mention . It record T2 . 10 . Patients go continue treatment exist malocclusion final detailing occlusion Criteria modifying allocate intervention : In case prolong swell and/or pain related mini plate , patient might wait three week coil spring insertion . In case loose broken mini plate , surgical intervention may require replacement mini plat treatment resume total resolution inflammation . Adherence : The patient ask attend regular follow-up visit adherence appointment regularly monitor . Reminder call message utilize improve adherence . The patient adherence intervention instruction monitor . All participant include intention treat analysis , regardless adherence . B . Control group : The subject fulfil previously mention inclusion criterion sign inform consent agreement recruit study . According randomization sheet ( do E.M. ) , patient allocate control group immediately refer uptake CBCT , consider ( T1 ) without treatment procedure . A `` treatment '' phase 6 month carry patient follow monitor factor might occur exclude patient study . Another CBCT image take 6 month ( T2 ) , T2 image consider initial diagnostic image patient . The patient assess treatment provide patient require . Adherence : The patient ask attend regular follow-up visit full intra oral extra oral examination perform ( E.M.and M.N ) . Referral patient restorative and/or periodontal therapy may do need case . The patient ' adherence appointment regularly monitor . Reminder call message utilize improve adherence . . Patients control group go start treatment exist malocclusion ( M. N ) Participant timeline : The patient request visit institutional clinic require adjustment preparatory phase The patient schedule attend day surgery , 1 week , 2 3 week surgery . They also request immediate show case emergency . During posterior segment intrusion , patient schedule attend every 3-4 week appliance activation monitoring treatment progress . The control group patient request visit clinic every 4 week follow improvement patient ' adherence .</detailed_description>
