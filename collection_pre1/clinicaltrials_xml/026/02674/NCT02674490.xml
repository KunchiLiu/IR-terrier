	<brief_summary>The investigator study effect transcranial direct current ( tDCS ) stimulation language therapy name individual aphasia acute subacute post stroke period . Naming difficulty persistent common symptom aphasia left-hemisphere ( LH ) stroke . Behavioral therapy ( speech language therapy ; SALT ) mainstay treatment post stroke aphasia . Transcranial direct cortical stimulation ( tDCS ) promise adjunct traditional SALT . tDCS safe , non-invasive , non-painful electrical stimulation brain modulate cortical excitability application weak electrical current form direct current brain polarization . It usually administer via saline-soaked surface sponge electrode attach scalp connect direct current stimulator low intensity . Most study conduct chronic phase stroke . Because neuroplasticity great early stroke , reason believe tDCS might effective acute-subacute period . However , two study evaluate tDCS pair language therapy group study acute subacute aphasic stroke patient one sham-controlled . Furthermore , study ( aware ) combine tDCS therapy facilitate name post stroke aphasia , show effective study chronic stroke . In study , investigator evaluate whether tDCS combine SALT improve naming individual aphasia acute subacute post stroke period , SALT alone randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled trial . The investigator test hypothesis anodal tDCS ( A-tDCS ) target region computer-delivered SALT associate great gain accuracy name picture , compare sham combine computer-delivered SALT post stroke aphasia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After informed consent receive , neurological examination perform multiple screening assessment conduct include tDCS MRI safety screening . If participant pass initial screen portion , speech language diagnostic testing conduct visit ( Visit 1 ) . During next visit ( Visit 2 ) , participant undergo second baseline assessment name ability assessment connect speech . On visit , participant contraindication MRI ( agree MRI ) randomize ( 1 ) fMRI electrode placement ( 2 ) structural electrode placement . All participant contraindication structural rest state functional connectivity MRI ( rsfcMRI ) . Those randomized fMRI electrode placement also participate name paradigm MRI . The third visit include electrode position tDCS treatment administration . Participants receive 15 session ( Visits 3-17 ) tDCS + SALT administration . At begin Visit 3 , eligible participant randomize receive either A-tDCS ( 1 mA ) sham-tDCS ( placebo ) 15 session ( 20-minutes per 45-minute behavioral treatment session ) course three week . A computer-delivered naming treatment couple stimulation . The computer-delivered treatment task 45-minutes total length , commence time tDCS administration continue another 25-minutes tDCS cease . To assess cardiovascular arousal , blood pressure heart rate measure session . Additionally , discomfort rating record follow end session use Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale weekly neurological exam administer neurologist . Neither participant clinician monitoring set treatment knowledge treatment condition ( A-tDCS versus sham ) . Utilizing computerized picture name assessment , participant assess several different time point throughout experiment : twice immediately twice week immediately follow fifteenth final treatment session ; twice five week follow-up end treatment ; twice 20 week end treatment . Participants agree participate MRI portion study ( none additional exclusion criterion MRI ) structural rsfcMRI Visit 2 , follow 15th treatment session ( Week 1 end treatment ) , 5 week end treatment .</detailed_description>
