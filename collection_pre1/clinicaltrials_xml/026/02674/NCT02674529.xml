	<detailed_description>Over past decade , neuroimaging tool rapidly advance field neural biomarkers treatment response depression . Still , despite obvious scientific progress field , ability implement neuroimaging biomarkers antidepressant treatment response clinical trial setting lack . In order objectively asses neural base treatment response depression , investigator use `` Real-time Neurofeedback fMRI task '' , specifically design record modulate mood improvement provide neurofeedback context administration antidepressant treatment . In pilot study , positive neurofeedback administration drug associate significant acute mood improvement increase blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) responses rostral anterior cingulate cortex ( rACC ) , common neural target antidepressant treatment . The central hypothesis antidepressant effect depression mediate increased neural activity rACC ( AIM1 ) , use clinical trial antidepressant treatment predict antidepressant effect ( AIM 2 ) ass effect antidepressant treatment antidepressant-induced rACC neural response ( AIM 3 ) . The result obtain project expect important impact ability understand cognitive neural mechanism implicate antidepressant treatment response patient depression , well ability implement neuroimaging biomarkers treatment response clinical trial setting .</detailed_description>
