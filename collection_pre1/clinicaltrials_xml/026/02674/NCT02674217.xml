	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic , inflammatory , debilitate disease cause destruction central nervous system ( CNS ) myelin , vary degree axonal damage .

The form disease might benefit transplantation : relapsing remitting , primary secondary progressive , `` malignant '' form , provide evidence inflammatory activity time transplant indication . Since 1993 group engage practice HSCT use novel method decrease toxicity procedure diminish cost ( 7-14 ) ; do 400 HSCT different disease acute leukemia , chronic leukemia , aplastic anemia , myeloma , lymphoma , myelodysplasia autoimmune disease , include MS . Within subset autologous HSCT , salient feature method conduct outpatient basis ( 8-9 , 15-16 ) avoid freeze thaw hematopoietic cell order increase viability hematopoietic cell graft reduce cost ( 8-9 , 15-16 ) always employ peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) . All change turn practice autografting hand affordable procedure offer individual live underprivileged circumstance prevail develop country ( 17 ) . Having gain experience autografting hematological malignancy ( 8-9 , 15 ) aim engage program graft non-cryopreserved autologous hematopoietic stem cell patient MS , employ modification autografting condition regimen use malignant disease . Material method 1 . Patients : Patients MS refer center HSCT November 2006 July 2015 prospectively enter study . Individuals relapsing-remitting ( RRMS ) course , secondary progressive ( SPMS ) , primary progressive ( PPMS ) progressive relapse ( PRMS ) include . Patients Karnofsky performance status ( 18 ) 70 % EDSS score ( 1 ) 6 . The study approve Ethics Committee Clinic Ruiz patient sign consent form fully inform procedure possible complication . 2 . Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization apheresis : The PBSC mobilization schedule do cyclophosphamide ( Cy ) filgrastim ( G-CSF ) . Intravenous Cy ( 1.5 gr/m2 ) deliver 120 minute period day -13 -12 . Subcutaneous G-CSF ( 10 ug / Kg / bid ) deliver day -11 -3 . Using either peripheral vein Mahurkar-type subclavian catheter , apheresis procedure perform day - 2 - 1 , use Baxter C-3000 PLUS Amicus machine ( Baxter Healthcare , Deerfield IL ) , Spin-Nebraska protocol ( 19 ) . The apheresis objective reach least 1 x106 viable CD34+ cells/Kg . 3 . Conditioning autografting : As outpatient , intravenous Cy ( 50 mg ( Kg ) deliver along 120 minute period day -11 , -10 , - 2 - 1 follow MESNA ( 1000 mg/m2 along 180-minute period ) , ondansetron 8 mg , dexamethasone 4 mg pantoprazole 40 mg. After intravenous Cy , ondansetron ( 4 mg every 12 h chemotherapy ) , oral cotrimoxazol ( 800 / 160 mg every 24 h ) , oral fluconazole ( 200 mg ) oral acyclovir ( 400 mg every 12 h ) use patient granulocyte great 0.5 x 109/L ; period patient laboratory workup clinical study every 48 h. After recovery granulocyte , patient give rituximab ( 375 mg/m2 along 3 h period ) , follow six month , cotrimoxazol 800/160 mg bid three time week , acyclovir 800 mg daily . In addition , rituximab ( 100 mg ) deliver every two month along 12-month period . 4 . Apheresis product preservation , study infusion : The product apheresis 1 ml aliquot keep ACD-A ( Baxter Healthcare , Deerfield IL ) 4oC , 300 ml transfer pack ( Baxter Healthcare , Deerfield IL ) compose gas impermeable , polyvinyl chloride plastic film 72 hour . Enumeration total white mononuclear cell ( MNC ) CD34 positive cell do flow-cytometry ( 20 ) EPICS Elite ESP apparatus ( Coulter Electronics , Hialeah , FL ) , use latter subpopulation anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody HPCA-2 ( Becton Dickinson , San José CA ) , gate propidium iodide-excluding CD45 ( + ) MNC population accord forward 90° angle light scatter . Additional viability study MNC use propidium iodide exclusion anti-cell antibody flow cytometer . No purging procedure perform . The apheresis product obtain day - 2 - 1 reinfused patient day 0 +1 respectively keep conventional blood bank refrigerator .</detailed_description>
