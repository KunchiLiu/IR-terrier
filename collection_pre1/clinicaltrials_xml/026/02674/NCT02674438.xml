	<brief_summary>Heart failure condition heart pump function normally cause lung become congest . The primary symptom heart failure shortness breath , often lead patient visit emergency department care . Decision-making emergency department high-stakes situation , need decision support guide clinician make good decision admission hospital discharge home . Many low-risk patient could potentially manage home admit hospital whereas patient think safe discharge actually high risk adverse outcome discharge home emergency department . In trial , investigator study new strategy heart failure care , comprise computer algorithm help doctor make decision emergency department risk patient . For low-risk patient discharge home emergency department short hospital stay , patient refer rapid follow-up clinic heart specialist team rapidly assess treat patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Outcomes Access Care Heart Failure Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overview : Randomized intervention trial examine impact acute heart failure strategy , incorporate risk stratification rapid outpatient care discharge . Study Population : Patients present emergency department heart failure eligible study inclusion . Intervention : The study involve 2 component : clinical algorithm prognostication post-discharge follow-up Rapid Ambulatory Program Investigation Diagnosis Heart Failure ( RAPID-HF ) clinic . The clinical decision-support algorithm intervention composite Emergency Heart failure Mortality Risk Grade ( EHMRG ) 7-day EHMRG 30-day ( EHMRG30-ST ) risk score . Using EHMRG/EHMRG30-ST algorithm , patient categorize high , intermediate , low risk . The decision support algorithm recommend hospital admission discharge/observation base patient risk assist clinician make final decision admit discharge . Patients refer RAPID-HF assess ideally within 48 hour discharge . RAPID-HF provide transitional care 30 day discharge . After 30-days , care transfer primary care provider specialist ongoing care . Study Design : Using stepped-wedge design , participate site randomize active intervention . At step , hospital yet randomize serve control sit .</detailed_description>
