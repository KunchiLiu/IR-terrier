	<detailed_description>• Study Design : A control randomized clinical trial ( CRCT ) • Study Site : The study carry Department Obstetrics Gynecology Beni-suef University Hospital • Study Population : The study population include pregnant woman 36-40 week gestational age attend antenatal care eligible insertion IUCD delivery elective caesarean section . • Study Sample : The study consist 200 woman choose randomly elective low segment caesarean section do Obstetrics Gynecology department , willing intrauterine device ( IUD ) insert postpartum contraception willing comply study protocol . After informed consent obtain , eligible study participant randomize 2 group : Group ( A ) : 100 Women receive Pregna ® IUD 6 week postpartum visit Group ( B ) : 100 Women receive Pregna ® IUD within 10 minute delivery placenta caesarean section . • Study Procedure : Insertion Technique : During caesarean section : Uterine cavity inspect presence malformation follow placental delivery , would limit use IUCD.The IUCD ( Pregna Copper T 380A ) remove insertion sleeve place sterile field . Uterus stabilize grasp fundus . Insertion do cesarean delivery , ex pulsion placenta uterine incision , manually ( IUCD Held middle index finger ) . It insert uterus uterine incision release fundus uterus . Hand remove slowly uterus . Enough care take dislodge IUCD hand remove . Strings guide toward low uterine segment without disturb IUCD 'S fundal position . Enough Care take include IUCD string uterine closure . Delayed postpartum IUDs Will insert usual sterile fashion describe manufacturer 's instruction 6-week postpartum visit Later Prior Discharge : - IUCD Client card , show type IUCD date insertion give patient . - She inform IUCD side effect normal postpartum symptom . - Patients schedule control examination 1 week , 6 week , 3 month 6 month insertion . - She advise contact one physicians immediately experience : - - Unusual vaginal discharge different usual lochia . - Lower abdominal pain , especially accompany fever chill . - Feeling pregnant . - Suspicion IUCD fallen .

If thread IUD see history expulsion IUD , pelvic ultrasonography X-ray pelvis do note misplace IUD . - All patient subject follow : - The IUD remove case partial expulsion , bleed pain , patient 's request . - Ethical Considerations 1-Approval institution ethical committee 2-Individual Consent Process : Written inform consent take explain study objective procedure potential participant . Participation voluntary participant inform decision participate impact quality care receive . - The statistical Analysis : Data statistically describe term mean + standard deviation ( +/- SD ) , frequency ( number case ) relative frequency ( percentage ) appropriate . Comparison numerical variable study group do use Student test independent sample . For compare categorical data , Chi square ( X2 ) test perform . Exact test use instead expected frequency less 5 .
