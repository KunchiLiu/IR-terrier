	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION Gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) presence symptom ( heartburn , regurgitation ) lesion attribute reflux gastric content esophagus . In human , pain multimodal experience compost sensory , physiological psychological aspect . In order mimic clinical situation , experimental model base multimodal test regimen different receptor central nervous system mechanism activate . Typical atypical symptom may arise acid reflux , also reflux less acidic pH ( pH 4-7 ) . In GERD patient persist symptom proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy , ongoing weakly acidic reflux well establish important underlying factor . The basis symptom generation weakly acidic reflux remains determine , acid sensitivity pH range 4-7 , mechanical distension , sensitivity chemical factor esophageal hypersensitivity physiological level reflux propose . The investigator speculate visceral hypersensitivity play important role symptom perception . This suggest reflux parameter usual within physiological number PPI therapy . Also , investigator previously demonstrate refractory GERD patient increase visceral hypersensitivity thermal , chemical mechanical esophageal stimulation compare HV . Stress well know affect visceral sensitivity human . A majority patient GERD report stress important factor trigger symptom exacerbation . A real-life stressor could exacerbate heartburn GERD patient enhance perceptual response esophageal acid exposure . The interaction psychological state GI function complex develop field . The brain-gut axis , mediate effect stress Gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract , consider pivotal player pathogenesis functional GI disorder like irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) functional dyspepsia ( FD ) . A possible mechanism stress−induced visceral sensitivity could barrier dysfunction . A study perform human , show acute psychological stressor induces hyperpermeability mast cell dependent fashion exogenous peripheral CRH recapitulate effect barrier function . This increase intestinal permeability phenomenon appear prerequisite visceral hypersensitivity . The acute role CRH esophageal sensitivity study . 2 . OBJECTIVE Stress increase permeability via CRH-mediated mast cell activation . The investigator hypothesize stress mediate CRH-release increase esophageal sensitivity . Therefore , aim study investigate effect CRH-administration esophageal sensitivity group HV . 3 . GENERAL DESCRIPTION Studies perform HV . All participant receive sign copy inform consent initiation study . Esophageal sensitivity test multimodal stimulation two session ( placebo CRH-administration ) . 4 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Studies perform use multimodal esophageal stimulation probe allow esophageal thermal , mechanical , electrical chemical stimulation . During stimulation , HV record symptom perception use VAS . First perception ( VAS=1 ) , pain perception threshold ( VAS=5 ) pain tolerance threshold ( VAS=7 ) record . All stimulation immediately terminate VAS 7 reach . At time VAS 7 , subject ask draw refer pain area , identify pain location . Thermal stimulation perform re-circulating saline solution , heated water bath , balloon mount probe . Stimulation temperature steadily increase increase flow rate water bath balloon . The volume balloon keep constant ( 5ml ) avoid mechanical stimulation . A temperature sensor balloon continuously monitor stimulation temperature , display online computer throughout study . Mechanical stimulation perform distension balloon . The flow saline balloon , induce distension , regulate computer control pump . The volume balloon display computer screen throughout stimulation . Mechanical stimulation perform water 37 degree Celsius , avoid thermal stimulation . Electrical stimulation perform 2 electrode mount probe . Single burst pulse give duration 1ms 200Hz . The amplitude pulse increase step 0.5mA . The maximum intensity limit 50 mA , previous study show atrial capturing high intensity . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring perform safety measure electrical stimulation . Chemical stimulation perform infuse acidic solution ( HCl 0.1N ) distal esophagus , flow rate 2ml/min . The stimulation last maximum 30 min . After overnight fast subject come endoscopy unit Universitary Hospital Leuven , Gasthuisberg , study perform . Two session schedule every subject : one placebo one CRH session , one week interval least . Sessions run single-blind way , far placebo drug concern . The order placebo CRH-administration randomize draw card box card determine sequence . At begin session , multimodal stimulation probe position mouth . After probe position esophagus , fix chin subject remain semi-recumbent position entire study . Before actual stimulation start , adaptation period 15 min , get use feel probe provide instruction correct use VAS meter . Fifteen minute ingestion multimodal esophageal stimulation probe , 100µg CRH powder injection ( CRH ferring® , Ferring , Aalst , Belgium ) 1mL NaCl 0.9 % put together , solution inject intravenously course 1 minute . With dose , side-effects limit transient facial flushing last 5 45 min 75 % patient . During placebo session , 1mL NaCl 0.9 % put identical syringe one use CRH administration , inject intravenously ( IV ) . In way HV blind administration CRH placebo . Over time , HV receive placebo CRH first session random sequence . In second session , subject receive product he/she n't receive first time . Salivary sample obtain session determine salivary cortisol immediately placebo CRH-administration , 30 , 60 , 90 120 min administration . Salivary cortisol determine ELISA . On every session , assessment general mood perform POMS STAI state questionnaire stimulation test . The POMS consist word describe different feeling emotion present moment . The STAI state validate , widely use measure transitory anxiety state . 5 . DATA ANALYSIS The main objective show difference thermal stimulation without injection CRH . The number HV include calculated medium comparison test . For first specie risk α 5 % unilateral formulation , investigator need include 15 HV total order highlight expect difference ensure power 80 % . Temperature , volume , cross-section area balloon , pressure electrical current measure first perception , pain perception threshold pain tolerance threshold use determine esophageal sensitivity . Esophageal sensitivity different stimulus ( heat , mechanical , electrical chemical ) compare CRH placebo condition . To determine stress-inducing capability CRH-administration , POMS , STAI cortisol level stress-protocol compare basal measurement first study day . 6 . PERSPECTIVES If CRH-administration increase esophageal sensitivity , stress model could apply investigate influence real life stressor esophageal sensitivity HV . In third part , mast-cell stabilize drug could test administration stressor order investigate role esophageal sensitivity . In future , might propose refractory GERD control randomize trial .</detailed_description>
