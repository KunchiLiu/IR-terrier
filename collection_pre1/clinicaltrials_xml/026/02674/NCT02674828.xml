	<detailed_description>Specific aim : 1 . To determine reinforcement intervention increase walk . The proportion day participant meet walking goal assess via Fitbit , commercially available activity monitor , well continuous week goal meet . The hypothesis patient assign reinforcement intervention meet walk goal high proportion day longer duration meet walking goal patient assign standard care . 2 . To assess intervention reduces A1c . Patients randomized reinforcement intervention expect great decrease A1c patient usual care . In addition primary aim , secondary outcome also evaluate . The intervention expect enhance subjective objective index fitness , increase quality life , improve index diabetes management decrease depression symptom . Predictors response treatment also evaluate . Results pilot study instrumental guiding subsequent , large long term randomize study evaluate reinforcement intervention improve outcome youth young adult T1D .</detailed_description>
