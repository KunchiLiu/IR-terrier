	<detailed_description>Colorectal thoracic surgical patient susceptible poor postoperative outcome . In colorectal surgery rate post-op complication 15-20 % rate 30 day mortality 2.3 % . Thoracic surgery also carry significant risk , 30 day mortality 2.2 % rate post-op complication 29.3 % . Poor postoperative outcome significantly affect patient recovery increase hospital cost . Reducing postoperative risk therefore conveys significant benefit patient hospital . Preoperative physical fitness predictive postoperative outcome intra-abdominal thoracic surgery . In systematic review 6 study preoperative exercise intervention improve pre-op physical fitness patient undergoing abdominal surgery , however unclear translates improvement postoperative outcome . An updated systematic review meta-analysis performed effect pre-habilitation postoperative outcome . While result demonstrate preoperative exercise intervention 4-6 week duration reduce post-op complication significant amount work still perform area . The current colorectal/thoracic pathway diagnosis surgery 2 week therefore intervention long duration feasible . Clinicians may present difficult choice delay surgery perform prehab cancel pre-op intervention . To create great improvement aerobic fitness , participant require exercise high level VO2peak ( e.g . ≥80 % VO2peak ) . High intensity interval training ( HIIT ) require participant exercise high level VO2peak ( ≥80 % VO2peak ) . Participants exercise short period ( 15 second ) follow 15 second rest typically continue pattern 30 minute exhaustion . A recent review report HIIT programme safe individual coronary artery disease stable heart failure . In agreement paper recent meta-analysis note HIIT produce pronounced incremental gain participant ' mean VO2peak compare continuous moderate intensity exercise There number factor take account design HIIT programme e.g . duration intensity exercise phase type recovery period ( active vs. passive ) . Two paper compare selection HIIT protocols safety time high percentage VO2peak ( ≥ 80 % VO2peak ) . Protocols rest period ( passive recovery ) allow patient exercise longer low perceived difficulty . In one study 20 patient CAD , HITT prescribe 15 exercise passive recovery interval 100 % Peak Power Output ( PPO ) Maximal Aerobic Power ( MAP ) adverse event . PPO MAP power last completed stage maximal exercise test ( watt ) . This intervention high duration 80 % VO2peak ( 819s ) high completion rate 63 % . This protocol chosen study . HITT investigate preoperative intervention either optimize fitness prior surgery reduce postsurgical complication . Preoperative HIIT intense intervention require significant participant adherence . The safety , cost clinical application programme need perform . This feasibility study aim assess ability HIIT improve aerobic fitness two week prior surgery determine feasibility .</detailed_description>
