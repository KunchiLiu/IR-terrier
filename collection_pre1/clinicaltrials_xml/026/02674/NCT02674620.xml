	<brief_summary>A post-concussion syndrome ( PCS ) diagnosis historically lead recommendation continue mental physical rest minimize symptom . However , conservative approach consider pathophysiological mechanism neurological subsystem dysfunction mediate persistent sign symptom . Recently , develop research recommending target therapy specific post-concussion disorder ( physiologic , vestibulo-ocular cervicogenic ) . The Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test ( BCTT ) grade aerobic test emerge safe , reliable , effective distinguish post-concussion syndrome sub-types , quantify physiological recovery , guide return play decision making . It propose result BCTT use prescribe progressively intensifying whole body aerobic exercise ( walk biking ) , maintain sub-symptom threshold , improve autoregulatory function potential improve PCS symptom . Positive result BCTT make standard care University Buffalo Concussion Clinic Pan Am Clinic management sport relate concussion . Despite increase use patient post-concussion syndrome currently data use exercise treatment early stage concussion recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial sub-threshold ( symptom-threshold ) exercise therapy versus relative rest treatment subject acute phase concussion . If participant eligible consent give neurosurgeon conduct Physical Activity Readiness Medical Examination ( PARmed-X ) participant complete exercise tolerance test treadmill ( Visit 1 ) supervision neurosurgeon exercise scientist . Using standardized Balke protocol , participant perform incremental treadmill test point symptom onset exacerbation ( increase 2 point overall condition Likert scale ) . Those achieve peak Heart Rate ( HR ) &gt; 150 bpm exclude study since close full recovery . Those achieve HR &gt; 120 &lt; 150 bpm exercise exhaustion ( define final rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) &lt; 17 Borg scale ) randomly assign sub-threshold aerobic exercise ( exercise HR equivalent 80 % HR achieve symptom onset exacerbation ) relative rest . Any participant achieve HR &gt; 120 bpm return follow week repeat treadmill test ( Visit 2 ) . If achieve HR &gt; 120 bpm exercise exhaustion Visit 2 , randomly assign sub-threshold exercise relative rest . This participant must demonstrate level exercise tolerance reasonable sub-threshold ( 80 % achieve HR ) exercise treatment prescription . Participants randomize sub-threshold aerobic exercise give HR monitor specific HR intensity exercise 30 minute per day . Participants randomize rest ask rest 30 minute per day ( structured physical cognitive activity least 30 minute per day participation structure aerobic exercise entire study ) . After randomization , subject treadmill test subsequent follow-up neurosurgeon ( every 1 2 week ) determine physiological recovery . All participant ask document symptom data form 7-10 PM evening ( follow day 's exercise exercise group ) , along hour work/school , minute exercise . The study end point subject recovery ( determine normal exercise level exam treat neurosurgeon ) . Data Analysis All statistic present mean ± SD . Data analyze two-way analysis variance compare physiological variable exercise rest group duration study . Total test duration , maximum heart rate achieve peak respiratory rate compare two group independent sample t-test . A repeated measure ANOVA use questionnaire analysis . All analysis complete use SPSS 22 ( IBM corp , Armonk , NY , USA ) alpha level set p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
