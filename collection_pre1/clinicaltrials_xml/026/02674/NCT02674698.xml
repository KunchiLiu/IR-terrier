	<brief_summary>Objectives : The purpose proposal evaluate impact CNH Dashboard implementation quality VA Purchased CNH care relative CNH facility , evaluate quality Veteran-specific care purchase CNH facility transition safety outcome measure derive Veteran-specific CMS data . Methods : The investigator evaluate effect CNH Dashboard release randomize , stepped-wedge dissemination . This dissemination design allow u determine impact CNH Dashboard quality purchase CNH facility systematically single phase roll-out . In 4 step , The investigator release CNH Dashboard randomly select set VISNs . Dashboard release accompany education . Findings : The CNH Dashboard actionable information leader GEC local , regional , national level . Impact : When complete , program improve quality care Veterans receive VA purchase CNH program demonstrate improved selection CNH facility Veteran-specific measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate impact CNH Dashboard implementation quality contract CNHs relative non-contracted CNH VAMC Market . Stepped wedge Dashboard Implementation The investigator propose step wedge implementation CNH Dashboard , randomize VISN level ( n=3-4 per period ) . The stepped wedge allow maximization GEC resource systematic roll provide sufficient education every randomize VISN ( see education program ) . Every 3 month , bring new randomize group VISNs 'online ' CNH Dashboard ( Table 2 ) . The investigator select VISN level unit randomization , integration VAMCs within VISN . With approximately 4 VAMCs VISN , release schedule robust , manageable support award . The investigator pilot test CNH Dashboard 3 VISNs finalize information upload , dashboard , educational program .

The advantage intranet site allow control access site step wedge implementation . As project continue , investigator enlist assistance Indianapolis VAMC Center Applied Systems Engineering guide transition toward electronic dashboard accessible throughout VA intranet . Educational Program The investigator design educational program goal ) understand quality CNH present five star rating system , b ) orientation dashboard , c ) identify low perform CNH facility , ) available option contract high quality facility . This educational program include element didactic training , well coach throughout implementation . The effectiveness educational program determine anonymous participant survey . The education program roll VISN facility geriatric program leader . Primary Analysis While investigator randomize VISN , investigator analyze VAMC , purchase CNH selection occur . For VAMC , measure ratio average quality purchase CNH facility ( observe ) non-contracted CNH ( expect ) VAMC market . The VAMC average observe expect ( O/E ) ratio serve primary measure analysis . The primary reference baseline period consist average O/E 6 month prior CNH Dashboard implementation . The intervention period , CNH Dashboard release randomize group , last 3 month educational program deliver assess . The primary outcome average O/E 12 month roll period end . Each VAMC act control . Our primary analysis consist VAMC average O/E ratio Contracted CNH facility 6 month prior intervention 12 month post-intervention ( Figure 6 ) . From Figure 3 , investigator expect normal distribution , therefore , use Student 's t-test compare average O/E ratio . Currently , CNH contract generally write annual renewal 5-year master contract . Thus , quality low , contract discontinue annually . However , substantial overhead establish 5-year contract . While investigator expect CNH quality measure CNH selection , anticipate become factor non-renewal new contract initiation . Presently , VAMC contract average 12 CNHs thus , 2-3 facility per year contract . Changing contract process take time GEC resource ; investigator thus commit follow 12 month four group CNH Dashboard roll . Secondary Analysis To protect internal validity step wedge implementation , investigator must perform secondary analysis additional reference periods.12 This help account secular trend intervene event influence study outcome . For example , CMS revise criterion 5-star rank system downward CNH Dashboard implementation , investigator would introduce type 2 error ( incorrect acceptance null ) . In addition change contract CNH quality dashboard release , investigator expect movement toward high quality facility among VAMCs prior randomize roll . This change result VAMCs take action know examine respect contract CNH quality prior see CNH Dashboard . VAMCs either pressure contract CNHs improve change contracting practice . As result , expect O/E ratio rise naturally course study . Additionally , secular trend CNH selection , VA approval fee authority , OIG investigation , news story , VA organizational decision could influence selection focus CNH quality . To address natural change , investigator propose secondary analysis additional reference period . Our first additional reference period randomize group O/E 6 month prior CNH Dashboard implementation ( month -6 0 ) , compare O/E primary analysis period . Second , examine change O/E primary reference period . We compare O/E randomize group 1 randomize group use Student 's t-tests determine significant baseline change course evaluation . Finally , investigator examine O/E reference period function time . This particularly pertain Groups 3 4 long window ( 12 15 month respectively ) examine temporal change O/E without intervention .</detailed_description>
