	<brief_title>AHPBA Pancreatic Irreversible Electroporation ( IRE ) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The rationale create multi-center clinical database optimally collect clinical pathological data patient neoplasms order facilitate future clinical observational outcomes-based research . Inclusion Criteria Patients consider eligible inclusion database meet follow eligibility criterion : Evidence/suspicion Pancreatic neoplasm ≥ 18 year age Exclusion Criteria Patients consider ineligible inclusion database able give consent . Inclusion Women , Minorities Vulnerable Subjects This protocol include woman minority population . Vulnerable subject ( prisoner , child , mentally disabled person ) include study population . Primary Study Objective ( ) : To provide insight treatment selection treatment outcome Pancreatic IRE order develop evidence base physician provide best possible care patient Pancreatic cancer require surgical intervention . Secondary Study Objective ( ) : To provide data adverse event complication related IRE treatment . The AHPBA responsible data collection periodically audit data quality assurance purpose . The AHPBA review outcomes report participate Research Institution outcomes low percentile , investigator offer support analyze reason suboptimal outcome may seek support improve outcome . The participate Research Institutions receive certificate annually acknowledge participation Research Project . Goal Aims Registry ? The Specific Aims : - Gain good understanding us ablation treatment unresectable soft tissue pancreatic tumor - Understand limitation , concern , complication earlier user ablation treatment unresectable soft tissue pancreatic tumor Create multi-institutional group enroll registry study , importantly enroll future , prospective ablation treatment unresectable soft tissue pancreatic tumor study . Any patient undergoing soft tissue ablation may include study . To confirm , always data registry use data storage release data evaluation project-by-project basis . What Patients Eligible ? • Any patient treat physician believe ablation soft tissue would feasible care disease . Patients follow provide outcome data achieve Goals Aims Registry . To participate , thing need obtain site regulatory approval letter state acceptable collaborate patient de-identified data ( sample data collection protocol attach ) consent patient data collaboration ( The Registry ) . Case report forms/ data collection sheet attach The data entry web base . All treatment must entered—not first treatment . All follow up—up 2 year death patient—must enter . Common follow every 3-4 month first year every 6 month second year . In order ensure data accuracy require , first 5 patient enter , data sheet support documentation ( de-identified lab , treatment dictation , etc . ) send u make sure data entry correct complete ( e.g. , lesion dimension , measure response progression , etc . ) .</detailed_description>
