	<brief_title>GAS-Hem Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemophilia A X-linked recessive , congenital bleeding disorder cause deficient defective coagulation factor VIII ( FVIII ) . The absence FVIII lead 'spontaneous ' bleed episode ( occur primarily joint , muscle , less commonly , soft tissue ) excessive bleed follow trauma injury . With proper treatment ( FVIII ) self-care , hemophilia patient maintain active , productive lifestyle . With grow appreciation low bleed rate sometimes achieve , part , patient limit activity , grow interest understand hemophilia may still limit life despite absence major bleeds . The current study introduce test standardize method individualize outcome measurement base Goal Attainment Scaling ( GAS ) , method allow participant set goal address challenge meaningful monitor attainment area time . The Standardized Goal Attainment Scaling menu Hemophilia ( GAS-Hem ) online instrument set track personalize goal relate hemophilia . The goal menu capture common challenge face people hemophilia , accompany inventory descriptor personalize . The tool use track health individual across wide spectrum age , life experience health state . This 12-week , multicenter , prospective , observational , feasibility study 60 people ( age 5 65 ) moderate severe hemophilia A investigate feasibility acceptability GAS-Hem patient report outcome ( PRO ) measure monitor clinical progress participant-identified goal area . Outcomes , include GAS-Hem ( primary ) , health-related quality life , bleed episode ( location , cause , time ) treatment ( time , dose reason infusion ) assess screen/baseline , follow-up 6 12 week . Endpoints interest include participant GAS-Hem outcomes 6 12 week , participant quality life ( QoL ) outcomes 6 12 week , well participant clinician perception GAS-Hem useful mean identify monitor progress relevant goal area .</detailed_description>
