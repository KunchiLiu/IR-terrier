	<brief_summary>Conventional dark-adaptometers unsuitable mass screen tool due high cost , lack easy portability , need trained staff totally dark room operate , arbitrary testing procedure , associate time waste clinic patient burden mention . Consequently , dark adaptometers routinely use clinical tool retinal diagnosis monitoring despite inherent benefit visual electrophysiology equipment ERG system , whose cost feature may often surplus optometrist ' requirement . This trial ass dark-adaptometry test performance novel light-emitting system generate full dark-adaptation threshold function normal adult healthy volunteer . The novel system propose overcome issue associate current instrumentation ; semi-automatic easy use without need skilled operator . It envisage system could spread practice dark-adaptometry test adoption high-street optometrist . This allow diagnosing number retinal pathology quickly reliably , face age population , represent major asset Health Community NHS . This trial involve 20 healthy volunteer , distribute equal number 2 group 18-40 50-70 year old , respectively . Proven good health eye condition participant , one eyes randomly-allocated undergo dark-adaptometry test 3 time separate day within 3 week . Testing clarify whether use novel system possible reproduce state-of-the-art threshold measurement good well produce commercially-available dark-adaptometers . Threshold measurement elderly compare literature data adjust exclude age crystalline lens pupillary miosis contribution . Data variability system usability also assess .</brief_summary>
