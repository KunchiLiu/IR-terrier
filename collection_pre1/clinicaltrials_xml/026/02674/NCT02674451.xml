As would expect , incidence CIN much high patient underlie renal dysfunction . Multiple trial find CIN independent predictor prolong hospitalization 30 day 1 year mortality patient coronary artery disease . Intravenous contrast dye felt cause renal ischemia mechanism injury . Unfortunately , despite significant morbidity mortality CIN , therapeutic intervention reduce risk exception hydration high dose statin therapy . Recently , remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) , process induce transient arm ischemia inflate blood pressure cuff 200 mmHg 3 repetitive 5 minute cycle , lead systemic cytoprotective response ultimately reduce ischemic renal injury , myocardial injury , even cerebral injury follow coronary bypass grafting . While significant data support role RIPC reduce systemic ischemic injury surgical patient , one small trial study RIPC patient 's undergoing coronary angiography . The investigator hypothesize RIPC reduce incidence contrast-induced nephropathy patient baseline renal dysfunction undergo coronary angiography stable unstable coronary artery disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Contrast-medium induce nephropathy ( CIN ) frequent devastate complication coronary angiography , occur 10-50 % case dependent individual risk factor ( JACC 2004 ; 44:1393 ) . Multiple trial find CIN independent predictor prolong hospitalization 30 day 1 year mortality patient coronary artery disease ( Clin Res Cardiol 2009 ; 98:765 , JACC 2004:44:1780 , Ann Int Med 2009 ; 150:170 , JACC 2008 ; 51 : 1419 ) . The large retrospective study 16,000 hospitalized patient expose iodinated contrast find in-hospital mortality rate 34 % subject develop CIN versus 7 % match control subject ( JAMA 1996 ; 275:1489 ) . Despite incidence CIN deleterious outcome , therapy exist prevent CIN hydration withdraw nephrotoxic medication prior coronary angiography . Remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) protective response result transient episode ischemia , follow reperfusion , vascular bed remote organ undergo prolonged ischemic insult . Studies human indicate RIPC decrease cardiac enzyme release , clinical event , improves mortality patient undergo elective coronary bypass surgery ( Circulation 2009 ; 119:820 ; Lancet 2007 ; 370:575 , Lancet 2013 ; 382 : 597 ) . In addition cardio-protective effect RIPC , small , single center randomize trial show reduction incidence contrast-medium induce nephropathy approximately 30 % patient receive RIPC prior elective coronary angiography compare control population ( Circulation 2012 ; 126:296 ) . RIPC safely perform study inflate blood pressure cuff supra-systolic level ( 200mmHg ) 3 five minute episode separate 5 minute reperfusion . RIPC well-tolerated , easily administer mechanism may reduce incidence contrast-mediated nephropathy . However , additional large trial need validate use RIPC elective urgent coronary angiography patient risk contrast-medicated nephropathy .</detailed_description>
