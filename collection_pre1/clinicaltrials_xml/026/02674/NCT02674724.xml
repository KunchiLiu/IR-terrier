	<brief_summary>To investigate resistance training exercise perform twice week without gym equipment assistance 12-week period could improve balance patient Parkinson Disease ( PD ) . Methods : Sixty three patient idiopathic PD ( Hoehn Yahr stage II - III ) preserve cognitive function participate study . Patients randomize among three intervention group : resistance training free weight , resistance training gym equipment control group . Investigators use static platform balance variable assess primary end-point outcome measure . For secondary outcome measure , common clinical functional balance test PD apply : Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) , Mini-BESTest - Balance Evaluation ( Mini-BESTest ) , Timed Up Go test ( TUG ) variables dynamic posturography .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease progressive neurodegenerative disease affect motor function characterize bradykinesia , rest tremor , rigidity , postural instability . Despite pharmacological treatment , patient remain deficits balance , gait , autonomic system function cognition impact quality life . The effect resistance training PD still controversial balance improvement functional test target . Since result previous study resistance train balance still controversial , intervention require address question strengthen exercise may improve balance PD patient . Our exercise target trunk , leg shoulder muscle contribution patient 's posture .</detailed_description>
