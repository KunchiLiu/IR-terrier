	<brief_summary>Phthalates commonly use plasticizer link asthma epidemiological study . The investigator research effect phthalates airway immunology lung function , allergic response inhale allergen challenge . After expose participant either filter air carefully control level phthalate exposure chamber collect sample nose upper airway , rinse nose saltwater perform small brushing . The investigator also collect bronchial sample bronchoscopy exposure . After 2 week , entire procedure repeat alternate exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Phthalate-Allergen Immune Response Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose : To study effect phthalates airway immunology , lung function nasal allergic response . 2 . Hypotheses : Phthalate inhalation increase recruitment immune cell upper airway affect functionality immune epithelial cell . Hypothesis 2 : Phthalate inhalation alters cellular response inhalation allergen challenge . 3 . Justification : Phthalates plasticizer softener , use PVC plastic range consumer product . Since phthalates chemically bound plastic leak product , cause routine human exposure air , dust food . Exposure phthalates link worsen development airway diseases epidemiological study , effect phthalates airway immune response largely unknown . In study would like investigate one particular phthalate , dibutyl phthalate ( DBP ) , affect human respiratory immune system . The investigator expect response noticeable subject ; expect response may occur detectable careful examination cell tissue ( e.g . nasal lavage brush ( fluid nose ) , bronchial sample , blood , urine ) . Nasal sample use measurement nasal inflammatory response term cell recruitment level inflammatory mediator . Bronchial sample allow refine examination inflammatory response lung thus provide much detail information concern phthalate-induced response due allergen challenge . Understanding subtle change help u prevent health problem associate phthalate exposure future . 4 . Objectives : To establish phthalates alter cellular immune response upper airway . 5 . Research Method : This blind crossover experiment two condition ( dibutyl phthalate , DBP , filter air , FA ) , randomize counter-balanced order . After exposure DBP FA , deliver inhale allergen challenge . Data collection condition separate 2-week washout period . To evaluate effect exposure immune response lung function , investigator collect perform follow day exposure follow day : - Before exposure , 3h 24h post-exposure , collect urine blood sample , perform NAL , measure force expiratory volume ( FEV1 ) spirometry FeNO . - Methacholine challenge perform 24h exposure . - Nasal brushing ( NAB ) perform 3h pre-exposure leave nostril 3h post-exposure right nostril . - A fraction subject enrol bronchoscopy perform 24h post-exposure , bronchoalveolar sample endobronchial biopsy collect . The literature provide conflict data phthalates regard analytical endpoint . Therefore , facilitate choice endpoint principal study , well validate study procedure , 'Method optimization sub-study ' perform prior start principal study . A maximum 25 healthy subject recruit sub-study , sign modify consent reflect limited participation . These subject expose DBP CA , recruit collection blood , nasal lavage , nasal brushing , subset sample . They attend one visit Vancouver General Hospital , dedicate 1 - 3 hour time participate sub-study . Moreover , prior start principal study ( ) , four healthy subject may recruit 'Pilot study ' optimize logistics exposure experimental procedure principal study . These subject subject CA exposure procedure sample collect described actual study exception bronchoscopy . Samples collect Method optimization sub-study Pilot study , use establish analytical method measure immune cellular response white blood nasal epithelial cell response bacterial component ( Toll Like Receptor ( TLR ) agonists ) phagocytosis assay vitro phthalate exposure ( describe study procedure ) . 6 . Statistical Analysis : A mixed effect model use estimate effect pertinent contrast use test hypothesis . Specifically , model include exposure ( CA DBP ) , order ( CA DBP DBP CA ) gene variant status ( e.g. , GSTM1 present GSTM1 null ) fix effect subject identify number random effect . The inhalation allergen challenge give DBP CA exposures therefore included statistical analysis . The influence general phthalate exposure level 6 commonly measure phthalates , assess urine sample Day 1 2 FeNO/blood/lung function analyze mixed effect model include exposure ( DBP , CA ) , sample period ( Day 1 , Day 2 ) phthalate level ( Day 1 , Day 2 ) . A one-way ANOVA use compare pre- post-exposure urinary MnBP level various time-points verify phthalate exposure .</detailed_description>
