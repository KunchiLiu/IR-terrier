	<brief_summary>Up 50 % patient 60 year old develop postoperative delirium follow cardiac surgery . Delirium increase morbidity mortality , may lead long-term cognitive impairment similar patient diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease . The underlying mechanism behind delirium understood , therefore current prevention treatment strategy inadequate . Several hypothesis exist pathophysiology delirium , one role neuroinflammation . The stress associate high-risk procedure cardiac surgery may lead systemic inflammation cause endothelial dysfunction disruption blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . When occurs , brain susceptible neuronal injury via neuroinflammation state delirium may ensue . To characterize mechanisms neuroinflammation delirium , investigator explore biomarkers closely link step propose pathway .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1a . Test hypothesis endothelial injury associate delirium . The investigator hypothesize endothelial dysfunction associate increase incidence delirium cardiac surgery . To test hypothesis , investigator measure biomarkers subject undergo cardiac surgery . Blood sample three time point [ baseline , upon arrival intensive care unit ( ICU ) , postoperative day 1 ( POD1 ) ] analyze compare patient develop postoperative delirium . Aim 1b . Test hypothesis BBB disruption associate delirium . The investigator hypothesize disruption BBB associate increased incidence delirium cardiac surgery . To test hypothesis , investigator measure level biomarkers baseline , upon arrival ICU , POD1 . Aim 1c . Test hypothesis neuronal injury associate delirium . The investigator hypothesize neuronal injury associate increase incidence delirium cardiac surgery . To test hypothesis , investigator measure level biomarkers baseline , upon arrival ICU , POD1 .</detailed_description>
