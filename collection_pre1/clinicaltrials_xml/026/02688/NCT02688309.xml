	<brief_title>Pro-permeability Pro-fibrosis Factors Aqueous Patients With Retinal Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study determine correlation pro-permeability pro-fibrosis factor level downstream receptor/signaling molecule activation disease activity patient macular edema fibrosis secondary underlying disease . 120 patient enrolled clinic OR , latter patient undergo surgery proliferative diabetic retinopathy , rhegmatogenous retinal detachment PVR , rhegmatogenous retinal detachment without PVR , macular pucker , macular hole . Clinic patient must receive intraocular injection steroid part standard care macular edema progressive fibrosis . Surgical patient receive anterior chamber ( AC ) tap begin surgery , clinic patient receive AC tap prior intraocular injection steroid second AC tap follow-up visit 6 +/- 2 week first injection . The aqueous sample analyze measuring level various pro-permeability pro-fibrosis factor and/or downstream receptor/signaling molecule activation . We also determine correlation reduction foveal thickness improvement visual acuity change aqueous level pro-permeability pro-fibrosis factor baseline week 6 clinic group .</detailed_description>
