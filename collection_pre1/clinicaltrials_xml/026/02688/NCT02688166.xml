	<brief_summary>This research study help understand cardiac change may occur radiation therapy heart base measurement obtain biomarkers cardiac imaging . Researchers plan perform cardiac image biomarkers cardiac injury . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) provide ability quantitatively measure cardiac function injury . The cardiac biomarkers test effective diagnosis , risk-stratification , monitor heart failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal ass validity CMR biomarker examination radiotherapy lung breast cancer demonstrate evidence cardiac strain dysfunction proportional extent cardiac exposure course radiation . The investigator intention conduct pilot study 10 patient receive moderate dos radiation exposure heart ( 5 lung cancer patient 5 breast cancer patient ) treat current institutional standard idea could lead grant early sign cardiac injury measure . These patient ' treatment plan would include contour measure dose receive multiple structure within heart ( coronary vessel cardiac chamber ) well heart/pericardium . The investigator would obtain biomarkers bloodwork , , radiotherapy correlation clinical outcome Cardiac MRIs obtain prior 1 year completion radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
