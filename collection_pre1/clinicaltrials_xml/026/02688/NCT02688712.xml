	<brief_title>ExIST Study LY2157299 ( Galunisertib ) Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective Phase II study test efficacy LY2157299 combination neoadjuvant chemoradiation patient rectal adenocarcinoma . This study test hypothesis LY2157299 improve effector T cell tumor infiltration activity result improve pathologic response rate . The investigator propose improve immune response result improve disease-free overall survival . The objective : 1 . Determine rate pathologic complete response patient locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treat neoadjuvant chemoradiation investigational agent LY2157299 2 . Correlate immunoscore change prior therapy , therapy , surgical resection pathologic response MRI parameters 3 . Immune monitor evaluate potential biomarkers treatment success . Eligible patient histologically confirm rectal adenocarcinoma , AJCC Stage IIA IIIC AJCC Stage IV appropriate consideration primary rectal tumor resection . Patients undergo forceps biopsy rectal mass part diagnostic workup well undergo stag evaluation include MRI additional study sequence . Enrolled patient receive 14 day course LY2157299 follow repeat biopsy MRI study sequence . In trial investigator plan use maximum tolerate dose LY2157299 establish human clinical trial , 300mg deliver 150mg P.O . BID . On day 15 patient begin chemoradiation either 5-FU ( fluorouracil ) capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) . On day 29 , patient undergo another fourteen day course LY2157299 concurrent ongoing chemoradiation . Patients undergo 50.4 54Gy radiation 1.8Gy daily fraction deliver Monday Friday total 28-30 fraction . The acceptable duration chemoradiation , include treatment break delay , 8 week total . Six ten week complete neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo tumor specific mesorectal excision per standard care evaluation pathologic response rate . Patients follow disease-free survival , progression free survival , local recurrence , overall survival . A three patient safety lead-in perform , six week safety period follow completion radiation complete prior enrol subsequent patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients ( male female ) histologically confirm rectal adenocarcinoma , AJCC Stage IIAIIIC AJCC Stage IV appropriate consideration primary rectal tumor resection . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Age 18 year . Laboratory value ( perform within 28 day prior enrollment ) follow : WBC ≥3.0 109/L Hgb ≥9g/dl ( patient may transfuse reach level ) Platelets ≥99 109 /L Creatinine ≤1.5X upper limit laboratory normal AST/ALT ≤5 X upper limit laboratory normal Total bilirubin ≤1.5X upper limit laboratory normal BNP ≤ 3 time baseline value upper limit laboratory normal Troponin I ≤ upper limit laboratory normal hsCRP ≤ upper limit laboratory normal Cystatin ≤ upper limit laboratory normal PT/INR ≤1.5X upper limit laboratory normal Premenopausal woman must negative pregnancy test day treatment start must avoid become pregnant treatment 3 month follow completion therapy . Men must avoid father child treatment 3 month follow completion therapy . This exclusion require due toxicity chemotherapy , radiation , LY2157299 may form fetus , spermatogenesis nursing child . Also , pregnancy may alter immune function may limit treatment efficacy . Women childbearing potential must agree use medically approve contraceptive method treatment period 3 month follow last dose LY2157299 . Contraceptive method may include intrauterine device [ IUD ] , birth control pills barrier method . If condom use barrier method , spermicidal agent add double barrier protection . No active bleeding . Ability give inform consent comply protocol . Patients history psychiatric illness must judge able understand fully investigational nature study risk associate therapy . Active infection require systemic antibiotic . Active autoimmune disease define autoimmune disease assessment tool ( see protocol ) Diagnosis solid tumor malignancy ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within 3 year enrollment . History prior pelvic radiation . Aortic aneurysm ( see protocol ) Abnormal Echocardiogram ( see protocol ) Immunodeficiency , need immunosuppressive medication , need chronic steroid . Participation investigational drug study within 28 day enrollment . Pregnant lactate woman , treatment involve risk embryo fetus . Other medical psychiatric condition opinion Principal Investigator would preclude safe participation protocol . History cardiac disease , include myocardial infarction within 6 month study entry , unstable angina pectoris , New York Heart Association Class III/IV congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , major cardiac abnormality , predisposition develop aneurysm include family history aneurysm , Marfan syndrome , bicuspid aortic valve , evidence damage large vessel heart . Concomitant use strong CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer</criteria>
