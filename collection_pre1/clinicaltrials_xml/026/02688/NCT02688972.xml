	<brief_summary>Football sport congest calendar , require muscle recovery strategy cold water immersion ( CWI ) . This recovery technique well spread football club , although lack profound physiologic investigation understand effect athlete 's body . Objectives : The main objective study evaluate effect long-term CWI exposure football athlete 's . Study Hypothesis : H0 : The application Cold water immersion n't amend biomarkers , electromyograph signal , power perceive recover compare control sample . H1 : The application Cold water immersion amend biomarkers , electromyograph signal , power perceive recover compare control sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order answer question , investigator perform randomized clinical trial 23 sub-20 football athlete . All subject randomly divide two group ; control group ( 10 minute seat rest ) CWI group ( 10 minute 10 degree C ) seven day row . The investigator evaluate creatine kinase ( CK ) lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) molecular biomarkers muscle damage . The blood sample collect first , second , ninth tenth day . Yet , investigator assess peak muscle activity isometric strength knee flexor extensor , potency lower limb , perceive exertion ( PE ) total quality recovery perceive ( TQRPer ) order understand treatment physiological effect subject first last day experiment ( train ) .</detailed_description>
