	<brief_summary>This protocol molecular screening protocol . No drug intervention study include protocol . Based molecular profiling , patient may eligible drug intervention study SUKSES trial . This procedure perform first-line treatment . DNA extract archived fresh tissue blood . NGS-based cancer panel Nanostring CNV test DNA tissue and/or blood . Immunohistochemistry FISH do pathologist use archive fresh tissue . Tumor tissue ( fresh archival ) analyze use NGS-based cancer panel , nanostring CNV , immunohistochemistry and/or FISH . Specific method molecular test define standard laboratory manual developed pathologist .</brief_summary>
