	<brief_summary>Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) term apply breast cancer case &lt; 1 % expression estrogen receptor ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PR ) express HER2 . TNBC diagnose 15-20 % breast cancer case tend occur young woman biologically aggressive high grade disease . Clinically , patient TNBC poor prognosis compare patient diagnose breast cancer subtypes . Because aggressive phenotype due observation systemic chemotherapy offer significantly high benefit ER negative disease , current treatment guideline provincial organization recommend patient receive adjuvant systemic chemotherapy TNBC great 0.5 cm great diameter node positive independent primary tumor size . Currently , world-wide standard recommend chemotherapy regimen management TNBC neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting , treatment vary region institution . As physician know `` best '' treatment patient , genuine uncertainty ( `` clinical equipoise '' ) exist . Physicians choose different `` standard '' personal practice , use idiosyncratic decision making process , without physician patient know optimal option . This good patient , physician society whole . Determining optimal treatment remain important medical issue patient , physician society . This study survey opinion novel method allow comparison establish standard care prophylactic treatment use `` integrated consent model '' part pragmatic clinical trial attempt compare head head standard chemotherapy regimens patient TNBC .</brief_summary>
