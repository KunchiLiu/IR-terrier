	<brief_summary>This research trial study use targeted genomic analysis blood tissue sample patient cancer . Genomic sequence laboratory method use determine entire genetic makeup specific organism cell type . Genomic sequence use find change area genome may important development cancer . It may also help doctor improve way diagnose treat patient rare cancer poor prognosis lack effective therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Genomic Analysis Blood Tissue Samples From Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain blood tumor tissue next-generation sequence determine frequency find genomic alteration clinically available ( commercially research base ) target therapy . Treating clinician provide relevant validated mutation data treatment referral patient pertinent study . II . To collect clinical outcome patient actionable mutation sequence perform . III . To obtain whole tumor genome data data storage future computational analysis correlation clinical data . IV . To obtain tumor tissue development future vitro vivo cancer model . OUTLINE : Previously collect tissue sample analyze presence mutation via next generation sequence . Patients may also undergo collection blood sample analysis circulate cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) circulate tumor cell . After completion study , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
