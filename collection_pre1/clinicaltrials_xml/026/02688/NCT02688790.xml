	<criteria>Hospitalized male female patient preterm neonate ( gestational age ≥32 &lt; 37 week , age ≤28 day ) , term neonate ( gestational age ≥37 week , age ≤28 day ) young infant ( age 28 day 3 month inclusive ) receive least 24 hour appropriate noninvestigational intravenous antiinfective treatment glycopeptide antibiotic know suspected bacterial infection . Patients urinary tract infection due Grampositive organism may enrol Each patient 's parent ( ) /legal guardian ( ) must willing able provide sign dated write informed consent document indicate informed pertinent aspect trial Each patient 's parent ( ) /legal guardian ( ) must willing able , patient discharge hospital , return patient hospital designate clinic scheduled visit , allow nurse come patient 's home laboratory test , PK outpatient procedure require protocol Patients must expect survive appropriate antibiotic therapy appropriate supportive care throughout study Sufficient intravenous access ( peripheral central ) receive Investigational Product ( IP ) Patients must audiologic assessment within 7 day prior investigational product infusion consist ear specific hear test utilizing distortion product evoke otoacoustic emission , 1 . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day precede dose IP Patients currently receive intravenous vancomycin glycopeptide antibiotic . Dalbavancin may administer 8 hour last dose vancomycin . Vancomycin glycopeptide antibiotic give 7 day period follow administration dalbavancin . If intravenous vancomycin glycopeptide use unavoidable 7 day period follow administration dalbavancin , document concomitant medication Have aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) total bilirubin level &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ( neonate elevate total bilirubin could participate conjugate bilirubin normal ) Albumin &lt; half lower limit normal Have receive blood blood component ( eg , red blood cell , fresh frozen plasma , platelet ) transfusion 24hour period dose Have condition ( eg . Septic shock , burn , cystic fibrosis , acute hemodynamic instability include condition require pressor support ) would make patient , opinion Investigator , unsuitable study ( eg , would place patient risk , compromise quality data ; interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion dalbavancin ) Patients known hypersensitivity glycopeptides Moderate severe renal impairment define serum creatinine ≥2 time upper limit normal ( × ULN ) age OR urine output &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/h ( measure least 8 hour ) OR requirement dialysis ) Other severe acute chronic medical condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study</criteria>
