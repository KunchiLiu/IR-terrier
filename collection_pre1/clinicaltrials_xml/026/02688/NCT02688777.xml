	<brief_title>A Novel Strategy Decrease Fall Incidence Post-Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 15,000 Veterans hospitalize stroke year . Persistent walk balance deficit contribute long-term disability high incidence fall . Falls common costly complication stroke ; 40 % 70 % affected individual fall within first year . Falls lead fear fall , limitation self-care increased dependence . Of great concern , lead serious adverse event , include fracture , depression mortality . A primary goal stroke rehabilitation improve mobility despite persistent motor , balance visual-spatial deficit . However , goal side since increase fall risk . Here , investigator propose novel therapeutic strategy improve ambulation decrease risk fall : Backward Walking Training ( BWTraining ) . The investigator ' central hypothesis 6-week BWTraining program 2-months post-stroke superior standard care reduce fall within 1st year post-stroke . Identification risk fall necessary component post-stroke rehabilitation implement pro-active measure decrease risk individual rejoin community living . Recent research cohort elderly adult determine maximal Backward Walking Speed ( BWSpeed ) ( forward ) identify individual experience fall previous six months,6 suggest BWSpeed could simple , inexpensive screen tool identify individual risk fall . With randomized , blind design , investigator propose prospectively assess value BWSpeed tool predict future fall . A notable post-stroke conundrum increase mobility may increase fall risk.5 On hand , limit mobility lead multitude inactivity-associated deficit , include recurrent stroke . To date , intervention demonstrate efficacy improve walk minimize fall risk . BWTraining may simple effective intervention achieve goal . In investigator ' recent randomize control pilot trial ( RCT ) , individual sub-acute stroke participate BWTraining demonstrate 3-fold improvement backward forward walk speed fall self-efficacy . Further , BWTraining cause 75 % great improvement balance versus dose-matched balance training group . At 3-month follow-up assessment , BWSpeed BWTraining group average 0.63 m/s , exceed threshold fall risk elderly adult . Given success investigator ' pilot intervention , large rigorous trial need demonstrate reduce fall incidence extend follow-up period . The investigator design RCT address three specific aim : Aim # 1 : Test hypothesis 1-year fall incidence decrease participant randomize BWTraining administer 2-months post-stroke ( versus usual care comparison group ) . Hypothesis # 1a : BWTraining 2-months post-stroke reduces number fall next year . Hypothesis # 1b : BWTraining 2-months post-stroke increase gait speed , improve balance increase balance confidence next year . Aim # 2 : Test hypothesis BWTraining 2 month ( immediate ) vs. 1-year ( delay ) post-stroke effective improve BWSpeed . Hypothesis # 2a : BWSpeed improvement 2- 14-months post-stroke great BWTraining deliver 2 month versus 1 year post-stroke . Hypothesis # 2b : Improvements forward gait speed , Functional Gait Assessment Activities-Balance Confidence Scale 2- 14-months post-stroke great BWTraining deliver 2 month versus 1 year post-stroke . Aim # 3 : This exploratory aim test hypothesis BWSpeed 2-months post-stroke significant predictor fall incidence next year 1 year period , adjust covariates . Hypothesis # 3 : BWSpeed 2-months significant predictor fall incidence first year post-stroke , adjust covariates . This study significant since concern novel strategy improve ambulation minimize risk fall stroke . BWTraining highly novel , easy administer excite preliminary data suggest major potential therapeutic tool . In addition , investigator determine potential BWSpeed ( simple , clinically relevant screen tool ) identify risk future fall .</detailed_description>
