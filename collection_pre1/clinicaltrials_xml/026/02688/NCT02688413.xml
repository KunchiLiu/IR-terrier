	<brief_title>Study Evaluating MindMotionPRO Early Post-stroke Upper-limb Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study show MindMotionPRO tool allow patient increase amount rehabilitation therapy perform . This study measure rehabilitation dose , measure duration rehabilitation session number exercise perform patient . The study hypothesis patient MindMotionPRO group spend time perform rehabilitation exercise Self-Directed Prescribed exercise group . The effectiveness MindMotionPRO versus Self-Directed Prescribed Exercises also measure , base change rehabilitation performance measure . The cost-effectiveness measured resource utilization , define time spend therapist provide rehabilitation session .</detailed_description>
