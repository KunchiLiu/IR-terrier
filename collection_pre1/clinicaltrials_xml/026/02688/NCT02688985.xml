	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter , biomarker study design hypothesis-generating order well understand mechanism action ocrelizumab B-cell biology RMS PPMS . The study conduct two cohort i.e . RMS cohort ( 4 arm group ) PPMS cohort ( one arm group ) . RMS cohort : Ocrelizumab administer two intravenous ( IV ) infusions 300 milligram ( mg ) Days 1 15 . Subsequent dos give single 600-mg infusion Weeks 24 48 . Participants randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive lumbar puncture ( LP ) post-treatment Week 12 , 24 , 52 follow first dose ocrelizumab three arm group . A fourth RMS arm delay treatment start ( Arm 4 [ control group ] ) part randomization recruit separately , wherein treatment ocrelizumab delay 12 week pre-treatment baseline . PPMS cohort : Ocrelizumab 600 mg administer two 300-mg IV infusion separate 14 day schedule interval every 24 week . Participants receive LP start study dose ocrelizumab second LP Week 52 follow first dose ocrelizumab .</brief_summary>
