	<brief_summary>The risk hypoglycemia individual type 1 diabetes increase considerably exercise . As result , many patient type 1 diabetes experience fear reluctance pursue physical activity , order avoid discomforting symptom associate hypoglycemia . The bi-hormonal artificial pancreas , device use automatic delivery insulin glucagon subcutaneously subject type 1 diabetes , pave way revolutionize management disease . The investigator 's group recently complete study bi-hormonal artificial pancreas system exercise , suggest reduce hypoglycemia around exercise period . In order prepare future home study , ability detect , grade , classify physical activity appropriately adjust system parameter vital help prevent exercise induce hypoglycemia home setting . This study design collect 3-axis accelerometry data heart rate data variety different home activity , well formal exercise healthy subject subject type 1 diabetes . Additionally , investigator observe change glucose level exercise subject type 1 diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Detection Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The artificial pancreas , device use automatic delivery insulin glucagon subcutaneously subject type 1 diabetes , pave way revolutionize management disease . Already , benefit improved glycemic control compare current open-loop pump therapy demonstrate several trial . The investigator 's group show artificial pancreas algorithm dual hormone system effectively manage blood glucose clinic setting investigator specifically show great progress use glucagon reduce hypoglycemic episode outside exercise . The investigator recent inpatient study , yet unpublished , show adjust insulin glucagon delivery close loop treatment , announce exercise , effectively reduce mean time glucose level 70 mg/dl compare closed loop control without adjustment . The investigator utilized initial open-loop data study help devise dosing change artificial pancreas algorithm . In order prepare future home study , ability detect , grade , classify physical activity appropriately adjust system parameter vital help prevent exercise induce hypoglycemia home setting . Currently , closed-loop system transmits heart rate accelerometry output Zephyrlife BioPatch monitoring device Nexus 5 smart phone master controller via Bluetooth . The algorithm convert heart rate accelerometry data modify estimate energy expenditure - accounting age , weight , height , sex , rest sit heart rate - determine exercise present . However , data collection need hone specificity sensitivity detection algorithm account wide variety subject characteristic activity . This study design collect 3-axis accelerometry data heart rate data variety different home activity , well formal exercise , aerobic exercise ( calibrate treadmill ) resistance exercise ( straight-leg raise equivalent ) , healthy subject well subject type 1 diabetes . Optionally VO2 data portable VO2 mask obtain . The data collect used enhance algorithm , future closed-loop study , detect exercise automatically trigger algorithmic adjustment reduce exercise-related hypoglycemia exercise individual type 1 diabetes .</detailed_description>
