	<brief_summary>This study do currently approve commonly work target therapy anaplastic thyroid cancer ( ATC ) . This area urgent need patient , approve treatment also rationally-designed clinical trial design specifically ATC . Patients diagnose anaplastic thyroid cancer high likelihood die disease . As clear need improve therapy ATC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Anaplastic/Undifferentiated Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal multi-center , open-label trial measure impact treat metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer patient immune checkpoint therapy . This trial potentially lead development new therapy anaplastic thyroid cancer . The drug administer , pembrolizumab FDA approve known side effect active many tumor type . Programmed death 1 ( PD-1 ) PD-1/PD-L1 expression measure report patient undergo therapy pembrolizumab . This help determine PD-1 PD-L1 predictive biomarkers anti-PD-1 therapy . It also add data regard frequency aggressive thyroid cancer . Where available , genomic profiling data analyze determine correlation response mutational status .</detailed_description>

Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 7 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . 8 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . 9 .
