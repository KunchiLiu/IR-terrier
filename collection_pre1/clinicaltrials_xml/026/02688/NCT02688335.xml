	<detailed_description>This interventional study patient history habitual snoring use Cloud9™ Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) device delivers low level continuous nasal air pressure 2 cm H2O 4 cm H2O , two week home . This study design document adherence snorer , acceptance comfort therapy , bed partner ' subjective report improvement sleep quality , and/or reduction elimination snore . Study Procedures Baseline Assessment : The study begin baseline assessment determine whether participant meet entry criterion study . After consent , participant snorer history physical exam confirm entry criterion answer questionnaire ( Hopkins Sleep Survey ) ass sleepiness . In second step , snore participant meet entry criterion receive full night polysomnogram ( PSG ) confirm snore rule sleep apnea sleep related disorder . Participants already perform full night PSG part earlier sleep lab study Cloud9 device ( Treatment Snoring Trial ) re-screened , earlier PSG old 24 month , participant 's body mass index ( BMI ) remain within 3 kg/m2 original value . Run-In : The device give participant meet study entry criterion assess History Physical Exam ( H &amp; P ) PSG . During visit , snore bed partner ask complete questionnaire introduce device . Snoring participant instruct use device much possible 2 night . Usage data record device read return study site third day . Post Run-In Visit : During visit , snore participant partner administer questionnaire . Usage data device usage diary read compliance ( define 4 hour per night 70 % time ) . A study team member also take time discuss issue question participant may . Home-Trial : Participants find sufficiently compliant run-in ask use device home additional 2 week . Snoring participant receive compliance call day night 1 home trial . Additionally , snore participant receive compliance call week 1 assess user experience device . Final Visit : At end 2 week , participant return device sleep lab . Usage data device usage diary read compliance . Snoring participant bed partner also complete final set questionnaire . For participant , one visit ( sleep lab ) , assess quantify snore frequency severity . Every participant meeting initial entry criterion baseline study . For participant evidence obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) baseline study , duration study one night . Snoring intensity assess first baseline night study . Participants required demonstrate snore intensity exceed 45 decibel ( dBA ) &gt; 5 % 40 dBA &gt; 10 % sleep time baseline night study proceed home treatment night . For participant without significant snoring , study duration one night . For participant already perform pass initial study night ( see Baseline Assessment ) , full PSG night require . The investigator anticipate take approximately 12 month enroll maximum 50 participant home test . The investigator may stop enrollment earlier investigator demonstrate sufficient power effect low number .</detailed_description>
