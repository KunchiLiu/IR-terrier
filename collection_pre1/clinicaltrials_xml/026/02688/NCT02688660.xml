	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause death disability child . Each year United States , pediatric TBI result estimate 630,000 emergency room visit , 58,900 hospitalization , 7000 death . The incidence long-term disability severe TBI high , 60 % child require educational community base supportive service 12 month post-injury . Over 5,000 child require inpatient rehabilitation TBI year estimate 145,000 US child currently live disability severe TBI . Hospital cost acute treatment child TBI estimate ~ $ 2.6 billion year , gross annual cost account long-term care lose productivity approach $ 60 billion . Therefore , pediatric TBI major public health concern new way diagnose treat TBI urgently need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe pediatric TBI result range neurocognitive behavioral deficit resultant impact school performance , social functioning , quality life . Sixty percent child suffer long-term functional impairment severe TBI , 40 % demonstrate deficit multiple cognitive psychological domain . Importantly , recent meta-analysis reveal rather catch peer domain , child severe TBI fall behind time . These deficit cognitive emotional function major impact child 's quality life TBI . A large study recently report severe TBI patient demonstrate low quality life child undergo active treatment cancer . Considerable variation exist severity impairment within cognitive domain patient patient , likely relate mechanism injury , type location lesion , patient age , pre-morbid functioning among factor . While clinical scale Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) useful assess injury severity may provide general prognostic information , insufficient identify risk specific cognitive deficit . Identifying predictor impairment within specific domain would aid direct rehabilitation strategy towards at-risk cognitive domain , thereby improve long-term function quality life . The investigator partner ongoing pediatric TBI trial ( ADAPT Trial : Approaches Decisions Acute Pediatric TBI ) also enrol past UW patient healthy control . Consistency time follow-up scan , large sample size access ADAPT Trial injury severity data neuropsychological test give study unprecedented power ass relationship early MRI finding subsequent atrophy , white matter injury , network connectivity change neurocognitive behavioral impairment .</detailed_description>
