	<brief_summary>Patients large primary operable breast cancer offer chemotherapy prior surgery shrink tumour enable breast conserving surgery . Conventional assessment response chemotherapy relies change tumour size always correlate change amount viable tumour . Newer techniques functional MRI , microbubble optoacoustic ultrasound offer potential detect response chemotherapy evaluate functional change tumour vascularity oxygenation . Neither modality utilise ionise radiation . Although MRI widely use detect breast cancer , ability assess functional response chemotherapy prior surgery fully exploit . Dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) MRI sensitivity around 90 % provide quantitative measurement blood volume flow . Other functional technique detect variation tissue oxygenation : call blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD ) mechanism . The BOLD technique use special magnetic resonance ( MR ) sequence call T2* measure weakly magnetic effect deoxygenate haemoglobin . The investigator wish develop validate T2* measurement relate oxygenation tumour . The investigator also want validate MR sequence include diffusion weight ( DW ) MRI , quantify microcirculation blood capillary network diffusion water within tissue . Microbubble ultrasound establish technique utilise intravenous contrast agent comprise tiny microbubbles gas increase reflectivity blood enhance spectral colour Doppler signal obtain routine ultrasound image . Optoacoustic image new technique output signal depend oxygenation tissue study . It utilise light signal input measure ultrasound signal output . The investigator want correlate imaging finding histopathology surgical resection tumour .</brief_summary>
