	<detailed_description>This clinical study prospective , placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomize centrally evaluate intra-individual comparative study assess safety efficacy AR/101 concomitantly administer SoC accelerate epithelialization split thickness wound compare placebo concomitantly SoC , pannus volunteer undergo elective abdominoplasty . Total duration treatment study 21 day . The patient treat AR/101 placebo complete epithelialization 21 day , whichever come first . Evaluation treatment do daily outpatient clinic . Throughout study , safety data adverse event collect . All patient receive standard supportive care dress supply concomitantly AR/101 placebo . Volunteers schedule elective abdominoplasty practice principal investigator superficial split thickness wound create abdomen accord protocol 4 week prior schedule abdominoplasty . A total 8 split thickness ( 5X5 cm , 0.0254 mm thickness ) wound distributed abdomen umbilicus suprapubic hairline . All patient agree daily treatment hospital clinic professional staff study duration . Degree re-epithelialization assess photographically confirm absence drainage wind dressing . All treat wound achieve complete re-epithelialization within study period evaluate retention intact epithelium end study ( 22 day ) . At time subject 's abdominoplasty surgery , pannus subject surgically remove part abdominoplasty procedure , skin sample harvest excised pannus histologic molecular analysis .</detailed_description>
