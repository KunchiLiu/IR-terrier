	<detailed_description>According World Health Organization , lung cancer common cause cancer-related death men woman , responsible 1.5 million death worldwide annually 2012 . Surgery remain best option patient present operable Stage I II cancer , however five year survival rate candidate remain dismal 73 % Stage I 53 % Stage II . The high rate local recurrence suggest surgeon unable completely detect remove primary tumor nodule satisfactory manner well linger metastasis sentinel lymph node . By ensure negative margin image surgery would possible investigator improve rate recurrence free patient thus overall survival . Thoracic malignancies ideal disease investigate intra-operative imaging . Over 85 % lung pleural malignancy express folate receptor alpha ( FRA ) , therefore make folate receptor ( FR ) ideal target image agent . While folate initially distribute cell , redistribution , metabolism , excretion eliminate agent healthy tissue within hour . Tumor cell express FRÎ± retain folate fluorescent label folate conjugate internalize . It important note FRA express proximal tubule kidney , activate macrophage , choroidal plexus . However , fluorescence signal kidney expect significantly low tumor tissue . Thus , false positive detection rate expect extremely low . The investigator conduct Phase I clinical trial folate-FITC 50 patient lung cancer . In study UPenn , investigator adverse event . The investigator excellent sensitivity specificity technique grade 1 side effect ( allergic reaction ) . All side effect reverse injection halt . This study confirm FRA reasonable target lung cancer . On Target Laboratories , LLC develop OTL38 . Compared exist fluorescent image agent , OTL38 associate less auto-fluorescence due near-IR excitation wavelength see blood tissue 1.5 cm thickness . Thus , study , investigator 's goal change folate-FITC formulation OTL38 formulation . The fluorophore component drug new , whereas target design study remain unchanged .</detailed_description>
