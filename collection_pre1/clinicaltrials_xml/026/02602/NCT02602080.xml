	<brief_summary>Nausea surgery may negatively influence patient satisfaction , may delay discharge , cause unexpected hospital admission . The trend toward ambulatory surgery increase focus postoperative nausea , publish evidence base standardized criterion assessment . Therefore , result postoperative nausea diverse , especially report nausea incidence regional anesthesia , i.e . spinal anesthesia . When peripheral nerve block apply postoperative pain control , significantly reduce postoperative pain , opioid consumption side effect ; patient receive general anesthesia ( GA ) nerve block think likely less nausea patient receive GA alone . This study pilot study look incidence intensity nausea orthopedic surgery nerve block foot ankle ( FA ) patient nerve block either sedation GA total shoulder arthroplasty ( TSA ) patient . The result study help power future randomize controlled trial , compare incidence intensity nausea FA patient receive GA laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) versus spinal anesthesia .</brief_summary>
