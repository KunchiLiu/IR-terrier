	<brief_title>The Best Treatment Strategy : Surgical v Pharmacological Close Ductus Arteriosus Persistent Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ductus arteriosus varies length , diameter morphology . The duct closure occur two stage : first one functional closure ; second anatomical closure . This condition associate heart disease , modify natural history require individualized treatment . Treatment varies conservative , pharmacological surgical treatment , many controversy regard treatment decision . And aim closure , decrease likelihood irreversible pulmonary vascular disease , reduce associate morbidity mortality . The role prostaglandin E2 permeability conduit , indicate use cyclooxygenase inhibitor closure ( indomethacin ibuprofen ) . In various research study many factor associated failure pharmacological treatment ( gestational age , antenatal indomethacin le 48 hour delivery , use high frequency ventilation ) report , therefore , alternative treatment surgical closure . In pharmacological treatment ductus arteriosus persistent individualize accord gestational age , respiratory condition size newborn . With early drug treatment achieve closure patent ductus arteriosus 90 % case , late treatment 50-65 % . However , report treatment indomethacin , reopen occurs , two dos recommend first , addition side effect , contraindication complication . As well , ibuprofen contraindication . So closure ductus arteriosus persistent may perform hemodynamics surgical closure ( standard leave thoracotomy thoracoscopic technique ) . There specific indication surgical treatment ( response two cycle medical treatment newborn less 1000 gr weight I fail one indomethacin , absolute contraindication , significant hemodynamic repercussion . With surgical treatment third week life minimize morbidity . report many author complication rare mortality associate complication prematurity . So Surgical treatment consider alternative low incidence complication , mortality low cost , plus total occlusion 94-100 % Because , treatment patent ductus arteriosus preterm infant , range conservative treatment , medical surgical , currently much controversy treatment decision . This study aim determine efficacy safety surgical versus pharmacological treatment permanent closure patent ductus arteriosus preterm infant . Methods : Is open label randomize control clinical trial : 1 ) experimental group assign surgical treatment ; 2 ) control group assign pharmacological treatment , closure patent ductus arteriosus .</detailed_description>
