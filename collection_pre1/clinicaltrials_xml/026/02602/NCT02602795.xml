	<brief_summary>Before start treatment XR-NTX , medication block positive effect opioids help people stay opioids , individual dependent opioids first endure difficult withdrawal process . This study aim develop test intervention help people opioid dependent successfully complete transition ; investigator also develop test comparison condition aim reduce HIV risk behavior .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Distress Tolerance HIV Prevention With XR-NTX Initiation Opioid Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioid dependence serious increasingly pervasive problem . Opioid dependent individual significantly increase risk wide range physical psychological problem include HIV STIs . Extended-release naltrexone ( XR-NTX ) effective treatment opioid dependence , require opioid-dependent individual completely opioid-free prior initiation avoid precipitate withdrawal . The great majority individual attempt cease opioid use relapse initiation XR-NTX opioid withdrawal symptom detoxification . Distress Tolerance ( DT ) focus psychosocial intervention well suit address clinical phenomenon experience individual withdraw opioids . The purpose project develop DT intervention improve detoxification outcomes active comparison intervention target HIV STI ( HIV/STI ) risk behavior . The DT intervention adapt Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) . The HIV/STI risk behavior intervention target behavior put patient risk HIV STIs include unprotected sex needle sharing , well promote regular HIV testing . Both intervention deliver telehealth videoconferencing system . If HIV/STI intervention find result reduce HIV/STI risk behavior frequent HIV testing , relative DT intervention , investigator incorporate component DT intervention prior launch large-scale clinical trial . The long-term objective research program improve substance use HIV/STI outcomes opioid dependent individual attempt cease opioid use . In Phase 1 project , investigator develop pilot DT intervention individual transition XR-NTX time-matched HIV/STI risk reduction comparison intervention ; develop use iterative process pilot modification base data collect pilot participant . In Phase 2 , opioid dependent individual transition XR-NTX randomly assign DT , HIV/STI , Treatment-As-Usual . All patient receive medication assist detoxification study recruitment site . It expect , result project , investigator develop well-specified novel DT intervention tailor meet need opioid dependent patient transition XR-NTX , efficacy test future Stage II randomize control trial . If find efficacious , intervention serve effective mean facilitate detoxification opioid antagonist initiation , reduce individual societal burden due opioid dependence .</detailed_description>
