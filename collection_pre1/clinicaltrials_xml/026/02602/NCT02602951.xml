	<detailed_description>The dynamic angio-MR sequence injection contrast ( CE ARM ) allow study vascular anatomy . These sequence , widely use clinical routine show utility , particular detection cerebrovascular disease . The 4D flow MR sequence allow quantify arterial parameter speed circulate flow . By allow anatomical analysis functional analysis quantitative parameter , 4D flow MR sequence could replace 1/ currently use dynamic MRA sequence less precise term spatial temporal resolution ; 2/ invasive exploration DSA detection vascular lesion complete exploration cervico-encephalic vascular pathology ( arterio-venous deformation , cervical intra-cranial stenosis , intra-cranial aneurysm ) provide hemodynamical measure yet accessible clinical setting . In context , aim study evaluate feasibility clinical usefulness 4D Flow technique image brain vascular disorder include steno occlusive disorder . The evaluation include several step : 1/ optimization acquisition parameter cranio-cervical artery ; 2/ comparison two strategy post-processing 3/ feasibility image brain vascular disorder . STUDY HYPOTHESIS &amp; AIMS The investilgators hypothesize , optimize brain cervical acquisition , 4D flow MRA provide quantitative information available routinely available dynamic MR sequence . The main goal study demonstrate feasibility non-invasive evaluation hemodynamics ( quantitative speed measurement flow track ) neuro application use 4D Flow prototype . The secondary goal compare parameter derive 4D Flow prototype use two post-processing pipeline . 4D Flow image compare available hemodynamic information obtain part routine clinical care order ass whether additional clinically relevant information extract . The study arterio-venous deformation study supraaortic trunk require realization MRI sequence injection Gd clinical protocol routine . The sequence add end protocol modify injection clinical purpose .</detailed_description>
