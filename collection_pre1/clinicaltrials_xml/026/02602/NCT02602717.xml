	<brief_summary>Cytological examination puncture lymph node gold standard confirm metastatic lymph node spread differentiate thyroid cancer . In order increase diagnostic sensitivity fine-needle cyto-punctured lymph node , assessment Tg level aspirate could include . Although technique well proven , many uncertainty remain , especially regards pathological cut-off value clinical utility thyroid still intact . This uncertainty mainly due discordancy low Tg level find cytopunctured lymph node normal cytology , final histopathological analysis . To eliminate uncertainty , cyto-punction perform intra-operatively localize isolate target lymph nodes assessment cytology Tg value . The thyroid gland might present absent ( already operate ) depend case . Finally , cyto-punctured lymph node excise complete histopathological analysis . In order determine whether Tg value appropriate case thyroid intact , control group include ( First operation thyroid cancer benign pathology ) . To eliminate possible iatrogenic risk lymph node dissection resection patient indicate , lymph node find along incision path neuromonitoring recurrent laryngeal nerve ( perform systematically ) analyse excise .</brief_summary>
