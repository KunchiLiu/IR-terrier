	<brief_summary>It important identify patient acute pancreatitis risk develop persistent organ failure early course disease . The investigator evaluate whether peripheral blood non-coding RNAs , include microRNAs long noncoding RNA ( lncRNA ) , could serve good marker detection acute pancreatitis persistent organ failure early phase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Peripheral Blood Non-coding RNAs Diagnosis Prognosis Biomarker Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis sudden inflammation pancreas . It severe complication high mortality despite treatment . While mild case often successfully treat conservative measure , fast aggressive intravenous fluid rehydration , severe case may require admission intensive care unit even surgery deal complication disease process . The diagnosis severe acute pancreatitis early phase remain major challenge clinician . Therefore , many biologic marker study effort improve diagnostic rate determine severity acute pancreatitis disappointing result . Non-coding RNAs , include microRNAs long noncoding RNA ( lncRNA ) , recently validate stably exist peripheral blood . Several publication show may serve potential marker various disease , include cancer inflammation . Our current study evaluate whether kind non-coding RNAs could serve good marker severe acute pancreatitis .</detailed_description>
