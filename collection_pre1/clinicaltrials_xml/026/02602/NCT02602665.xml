	<brief_summary>This single center , randomize , control trial tunnel central line catheter place two distinct , select position . The catheter tip position follow prospectively placement determine whether malpositioning tip one placement better .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Central Line Placement-EVALUATION OF LINE DEPTH AS A FACTOR IN NEED FOR LINE REPLACEMENT SECONDARY TO MALPOSITION</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimal central line placement vital catheter longevity . If malpositioned , catheter may need get replace , potentially cause additional morbidity patient additional cost healthcare system . In department , retrospective study look catheter tip position inital placement incidence malposition . In study , 404 catheter placement review , total 162 ( 40.1 % ) replace . Out 162 replace , 36 ( 22.2 % ) replace secondary malposition . From study , also able conclude catheter tip place deep position , approximately one half vertebral body carina , less likely malpositioned future upon radiographic review . Current standard care dictate positioning line specific loacation . In presence finding , propose conduct single center randomize control trial tunnel central line catheter place two distinct , select position . After informed consent obtain patient family , randomize one two treatment group . The shallow group tip catheter locate approximately one vertebral body carina . The deep group catheter tip place 1.5 2.5 vertebral body carina . Central line placement perform fluoroscopy operating room optimize catheter placement . Chest X ray post operative area use confirm catheter tip position . The catheter tip position follow prospectively use chest X ray film within three month placement determine whether malpositioning tip .</detailed_description>
