	<brief_summary>Rationale : Lumbosacral radicular syndrome ( LSRS ) cause herniated lumbar nucleus pulposus ( HNP ) estimate annual incidence The Netherlands range 60,000 75,000 people . Open microdiscectomy standard surgical technique . In recent year , several surgical technique develop include , percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy ( PTED ) . While PTED gain popularity The Netherlands , evidence effect lack , lead heated debate . The current position Zorginstituut Nederland ( ZiN ) insufficient evidence support use ; therefore , PTED financially cover . The consequence , patient force pay cost treatment . This study expect provide necessary data answer question regard effect cost PTED vs. open microdiscectomy , help resolve current debate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Lumbosacral radicular syndrome ( LSRS ) cause herniated lumbar nucleus pulposus ( HNP ) estimate annual incidence The Netherlands range 60,000 75,000 people .

This study expect provide necessary data answer question regard effect cost PTED vs. open microdiscectomy , help resolve current debate . Objective : To determine effect cost PTED vs. open microdiscectomy . Study design : Pragmatic , multi-center non-inferiority randomize control trial ( RCT ) subsequent observational study sufficient subject recruit RCT . Study population : In total , 682 subject include . The inclusion criterion follow : subject 18-70 year age &gt; 10 week radiate pain with- without motor sensory loss leg , &gt; 6 week excessive radiate pain tendency clinical improvement strong patient preference surgery . There must also indication operation MRI demonstrate lumbar disc herniation nerve compression without concomitant spinal lateral recess stenosis sequestration . Participants must also sufficient knowledge Dutch language . Main study parameters/endpoints : There one primary outcome : self-report leg pain ( 0- 10 numeric rating scale ( NRS ) ) ; secondary outcome include among others functional status ( Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) ) measure day follow treatment 2 , 4 , 6 week , 3 , 6 , 9,12 24 month . The data analyze longitudinally , mean primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
