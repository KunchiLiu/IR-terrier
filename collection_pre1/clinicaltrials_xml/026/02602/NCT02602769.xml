	<brief_summary>Rapid onset Obesity , Hypoventilation , Hypothalamic dysfunction Autonomic Dysregulation ( ROHHAD ) syndrome name 2007 . The hallmark syndrome rapid onset obesity dysregulation central ventilation . There little information metabolic change lead rapid onset obesity child . The investigator would like study metabolic phenotype child understand disturbance energy balance lead rapid onset obesity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Late-onset hypoventilation syndrome hypothalamic dysfunction first described 1965 rename ROHHAD syndrome 2007 Ize-Ludlow et al . The hallmark ROHHAD syndrome rapid-onset obesity start approximately 1.5 year age weight gain 12-20 kg/year , central hypoventilation distinct obstructive hypoventilation cause obesity , hyperphagia , spectrum pituitary hormonal dysfunction , autonomic disturbance include temperature , blood pressure , nociception abnormality . Some child note developmental behavioral abnormality . Tumors neural crest origin identify 25-33 % patient . The etiology ROHHAD syndrome cause rapid onset obesity unknown . The aim study understand biological mechanism behind rapid weight gain early childhood child ROHHAD syndrome compare age , sex BMI match control . Aim 1 . Determine change energy expenditure contribute severe obesity child ROHHAD syndrome : The investigator perform detailed metabolic phenotyping include total energy expenditure use doubly label water , rest energy expenditure use indirect calorimetry , body composition Dual X-ray absorptiometry . The investigator anticipate child ROHHAD syndrome low total rest energy expenditure compare age- , sex- BMI- matched control . Aim 2 : Determine feed and/or feeding signal postprandial period dysregulated child ROHHAD syndrome : The investigator measure spontaneous food intake , follow response postprandial state : leptin , ghrelin metabolic fuel concentration ( glucose , lipid ketone ) . The investigator expect abnormality caloric intake adjust energy expenditure , peripheral hormonal signal hunger satiety , metabolic fuel concentration .</detailed_description>
