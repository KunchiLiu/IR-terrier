	<brief_title>Experimental Medicine Study Validate Pharmacodynamic Pain Assessments Healthy Volunteers With Opioid Analgesic ( Remifentanil )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain area large unmet medical need priority disease area GlaxoSmithKline . Selection new candidate pain involves test animal model ; however , predictive value may limit . High risk carry forward Phase II Proof Concept ( PoC ) study require large financial time commitment . Assessment pain Phase I study serve useful indicator pharmacodynamic activity potential analgesic treatment reduce development risk , help make decision compound progression , dose selection design clinical study pain patient . GlaxoSmithKline 's Pain &amp; Neurophysiology group Clinical Unit Cambridge ( CUC ) develop number human pain model specifically tailor GSK 's portfolio begin implementation clinical development . Some model already use successfully detect PD activity Phase I [ Chizh , 2007 ] Currently , candidate select neurology Centre Excellence Drug Discovery ( CEDD , plan utilise human pain model part clinical development , include FTIH study . Because limited in-house capacity , ongoing effort identify suitable external group ( ) methodology pain model PD assessment could transfer . Involving external group could also help access new patient group , Phase I Phase II experimental assessment could facilitate provide early indication efficacy large scale multi-centre trial initiate . South Korea identify country within Asia-Pacific region GlaxoSmithKline would like collaborate closely term early phase clinical trial , particularly First Time Human study . A satisfactory validation study enable u use methodology future pain study order link early efficacy assessment ( Phase I ) future patient study ( Phase II ) within South Korea . One group identify Clinical Trials Center Seoul National University Hospital . This site consider perform number clinical study potential new treatment pain .</detailed_description>
