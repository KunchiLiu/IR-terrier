	<brief_summary>This project aim identify brain behavioral characteristic individual experience symptom depression predict effectiveness Behavioral Activation Therapy . Brain imaging aspect study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) . Behavioral assessment include self-report questionnaire , computer-based observational task , interview . Assessments focus individual process positive information ( reward ) negative information ( distress image ) , well people make decision . These assessment conduct across 2-3 in-person session prior begin treatment , repeat across 2-3 in-person session complete treatment . A blood draw also conduct pre- post- treatment . Behavior Activation therapy consist 10 , 90-minute weekly therapy session conduct small group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anxiety mood disorder prevalent class mental health disorder , lifetime prevalence estimate 32 % 18 % , respectively . These disorder tremendous personal socioeconomic impact ( cost &gt; $ 1500 per-patient/year ) due day lose work , increase health care utilization , increase risk mortality ( e.g . cardiovascular disease ) . First-line treatment depression include pharmacologic ( e.g . selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) psychotherapeutic intervention ( e.g . cognitive behavioral therapy behavioral therapy ) . While superior placebo treatment , 40-60 % patient experience significant improvement 15-25 % responder relapse within one year . Thus , long-lasting improvement experience less 50 % patient . This ineffectiveness moderately associate symptom severity , illness duration , comorbidity , finding provide strategy improve treatment effectiveness . The current study seek identify behavioral cognitive-affective predictor indicate well patient respond treatment intervention individualize effectively treat refractory patient . The aim study identify whether neural , biological , behavioral response related arbitration conflict avoidance approach drive predict behavior therapy response depressed individual . This aim accomplish use behavioral , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , genetic analysis pre post Behavioral Activation therapy . Research subject include treatment-seeking individual clinically significant symptom unipolar depression . Diagnosis assess use structured clinical interview . Anxious depressive symptom severity , personality characteristic , general functioning collect via self-report paper-and-pencil questionnaire . Objective measure approach , avoidance , conflict behavioral response collect use computer-administered testing related neural responsivity measure use fMRI . For exploratory aim , blood draw collect pre post-treatment examine genetic factor may predict response behavior therapy . This research potential identify neural behavioral approach-avoidance characteristic help predict patient likely respond behavior therapy depression ( i.e. , predictor treatment effectiveness ) reveal target future treatment modification . Aim 1 : Clarify potential contribution approach-avoidance behavior neural response depression symptom severity . Hypothesis 1.1 : Approach-related behavior conflict arbitration behavior explain significant amount variance depressive symptom , beyond avoidance-related behavior . Hypothesis 1.2 : Activations within approach-related ( i.e. , striatum ) conflict arbitration ( i.e. , lateral PFC ) neural circuitry explain significant variance depressive symptom severity beyond activation within avoidance-related ( i.e. , amygdala ) neural circuitry . Specifically , investigator expect increase level depression relate reduce striatal responsivity . Aim 2 : Identify approach-avoidance behavior neural response predict effectiveness behavioral activation therapy ( BA ) depress subject . Hypothesis 2.1 : Approach-related behavior and/or conflict arbitration behavior help predict treatment response beyond avoidance-related behavior baseline symptom severity . Specifically , investigator expect decrease reward sensitivity predict nonresponse depress patient BA . Hypothesis 2.2 : Approach-related conflict arbitration neural circuitry help predict treatment response beyond activation within avoidance-related neural circuitry . Specifically , investigator expect striatal responsivity reward predict response depress patient BA . Aim 3 : Identify whether functional improvement BA associate change approach-avoidance behavior and/or neural response . Hypothesis 3.1 : The level change reward sensitivity positively relate level improvement overall functioning BA .</detailed_description>
