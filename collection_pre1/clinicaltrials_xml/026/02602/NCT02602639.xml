	<brief_summary>Currently , spinal cord injury ( SCI ) demonstrate increase prevalence obesity ( 75 % ) cardiovascular disease ( 30 - 50 % ) , type II diabetes ( 21 % ) osteoporosis leg ( 100 % ) compare general population . It important identify mode intensity exercise likely generate reduction inactivity-related disease population . Therefore , main purpose pilot research project implement test form spinal cord injury-specific exercise , know FES rowing ( FES : functional electrical stimulation ) .</brief_summary>
