	<detailed_description>13C breath test measurement gastric emptying ( GE ) first develop early 1990s . These test clear advantage many GE image technique relatively inexpensive , simple use , carry child pregnant woman contraindication MRI . Therefore test use variety clinical setting assessment gastroparesis delay GE diabetic patient assessment GE fat contain enteral formula critically ill patient . Breath test rely upon ingestion 13C stable isotope marker medium chain fatty acid 13C octanoic acid ( OCC ) tryglyceride13C trioctanoate ( TriOCC ) . However , 13C breath test indirect measure GE . Thus , GE data acquire breath test result numerous complex interaction include : 1 ) chemical property marker interaction test meal gastric process 2 ) absorption duodenum , 3 ) metabolism liver ( oxidation fatty acid ) 4 ) final excretion 13CO2 lung . All complex interaction become compounded gastric processing lipid emulsion ( LEs ) investigate thus careful consideration selection breath test marker require . The investigator develop isocaloric isovolume LEs different GE property show previously MRI . The acid stable ( LE1 ) acid unstable lipid emulsion ( LE4 ) respond differently condition within stomach . LE1 empty relatively uniformly stomach . However , LE4 separate water high fat phase 15-30 min stomach . In late phase GE emulsion re-emulsified thus three distinct GE phase LE4 . Once separation LE4 occur aqueous low fat phase empty fairly rapidly stomach whereas second fat phase empty slowly . The differ GE pattern acid unstable LEs profound effect GE breath test data dependent upon selection breath test marker used.The investigator previously demonstrate OCC breath test ( OBT ) inappropriate measure gastric empty fat OBT influence 1 ) Post gastric processing OCC marker 2 ) interaction physical form concentration fat present stomach duodenum . These effect highlight marginal concordance agreement OBT half empty ( T50 ) 13CO2 recovery fat volume T50 ( MRI T50 ) LE1 agreement LE4 ( rc=0.7 rc=0.4 respectively ) .. The main aim study investigate whether TriOCC appropriate breath test marker use measurement GE fat . As TriOCC triglyceride similar physiochemical property nutritional lipid . Therefore , likely behave similarly gastric duodenal environment ingest lipids emulsion rapeseed oil . In study 1 investigator compare breath test marker TriOCC OCC LE1 . In sub set participant validate MRI quantitative fat fraction method use determine reference value half gastric empty time fat ( MRI T50 ) . This correlate half emptying ( T50 ) 13CO2 recovery generate percentage dose recovery per hour ( PDR/h ) curve . The interim analysis ass whether TriOCC relate gastric fat volume empty OCC marker LE1 . Should TriOCC representative gastric fat volume empty study 2 proceed . Study 2 ass gastric empty fat LE4 . A secondary aim develop algorithm quantify heterogeneity fat distribution within gastric content MRI data . The gastric processing lipid emulsion visualize MRI show result large inter individual variation fat distribution . By quantify heterogeneity aim determine degree flocculation cream emulsion across length stomach .</detailed_description>
