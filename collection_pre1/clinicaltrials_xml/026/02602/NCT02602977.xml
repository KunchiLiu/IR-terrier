	<brief_title>Influence Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Inflammation During Human Endotoxemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although immune system essential survival , variety disease originate inappropriate excessive activation immune response . Examples include wide range auto-inflammatory disease , infectious disease sepsis , also major surgery like cardiac artery bypass grafting , radiation therapy treatment cancer , follow organ transplantation . In instance , attenuation immune response could beneficial . The concept ischemic preconditioning ( IPC ) first describe 1980 ` . Murry colleague show protective effect precondition heart 4 cycle 5-minute long ischemia extent myocardial infarction dog heart . Follow-up animal study show protective effect heart introduce cycle ischemia distant , ` remote ` , organ like kidney gut . Furthermore , principle ` remote ischemic preconditioning ` ( RIPC ) also show effective human use tourniquet temporary cut blood supply one limb , either arm leg . As , RIPC identify cheap easy method protect patient undergo elective CABG surgery perioperative myocardial ischemic damage . In recent study , two different timeframes RIPC exert protective effect identify . The classical ` early window protection ' protects 1-2 hour RIPC stimulus ` second window protection ` evident 12-24 hour RIPC last 48-72 hour . Multiple-dose RIPC may additional value , 7 daily dos RIPC human result protection endothelial dysfunction , local remote beneficial effect last 8 day last RIPC dose . This could due additive synergistic effect combine first second window protection . The mechanism behind observed protective effect however still subject investigation . Several put forward , attenuation inflammatory response major candidate . For instance , recent animal work show RIPC result downregulation pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α IL-6 upregulation anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 . In support latter , cardioprotective effect RIPC absent IL-10 knockout mouse wild-type mouse treat monoclonal antibody IL-10 receptor . Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) show major contributor RIPC-induced IL-10 response . Adenosine appear major determinant anti-inflammatory tissue-protective effect RIPC . In vivo forearm model , adenosine ischemic preconditioning result reduction ischemia-reperfusion injury . Also , administration exogenous adenosine mimic protective effect IPC , antagonize adenosine receptor caffeine block protective effect RIPC augments anti-inflammatory IL-10 response lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . Interestingly , one pathways ischemia-reperfusion increase adenosine level upregulation CD73 , dependent aforementioned HIF . Another possible mechanism behind anti-inflammatory effect RIPC release Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) ligands , turn induce endotoxin tolerance-like state . Endotoxin tolerance refractory state immune system challenge TLR4 ligand LPS , characterize diminished cytokine production upon subsequent LPS challenge . However , induction endotoxin tolerance find occur LPS challenge also use TLR ( 4 ) -ligands , so-called 'cross-tolerance ' . A possible candidate induce tolerance RIPC heat shock protein 70 ( HSP70 ) , extracellular HSP70 show induce tolerance LPS monocytes vitro . Furthermore , rat receive ischemic precondition low extremity , HSP70 expression increase spinal cord myocardium , HSP70 upregulation find cardiomyocytes RIPC infant undergo cardiac surgery . However , , yet unidentified TLR ligand could also involve . From abovementioned study , appear RIPC exerts significant effect immune response . However , yet demonstrate set systemic inflammation human vivo . Furthermore , mechanism behind putative anti-inflammatory effect possible additive synergistic effect repeat RIPC ( thereby combine first second window protection ) unknown well . This study aim investigate effect ( repeat ) ischemic precondition human endotoxemia , standardize control model inflammation .</detailed_description>
