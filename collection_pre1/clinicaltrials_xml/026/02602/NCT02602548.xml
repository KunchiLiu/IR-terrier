	<brief_summary>This study describe time point positive culture patient undergone shoulder surgery treat infection versus false positive result disregard . Intraoperative biopsy take culture 50 subject undergone `` open '' surgical procedure 50 subject undergoing arthroscopic procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Incidence Incubation Period False Positive Cultures Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative infection significant complication require timely identification treatment . Indolent infection , involve Propionibacterium acne ( P. acne ) , pose diagnostic dilemma present differently acute symptom typically associate postoperative bone joint infection . The workup suspect infection also somewhat difficult , colony slow grow , necessitate culture keep extended period time . Previous study show positive culture typically identify 7 13 day . In recent study patient undergo primary shoulder arthroplasty , 41.8 % patient find P. acne growth joint fluid mean 7 day ( range 5-9 day ) . All patient treat immediately 4 week dual oral antibiotic therapy1 . As incubation laboratory culture increase , potential concern false positive growth . Timely identification critical order avoid perform unnecessary treatment patient infection actually present . The investigator enroll patient undergoing primary shoulder surgery clearly identify mechanical dysfunction , clinical suspicion infection . Infection exist population , make appropriate clinical sample study result investigator would consider false positive .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients undergo primary open arthroscopic shoulder surgery clear diagnosis mechanical problem felt amenable surgical intervention suspicion infection . Examples include , limited : rotator cuff tear , labral tear , instability , impingement , osteoarthritis . Prior shoulder surgery Prior glenohumeral injection within last 6 month Systemic shoulder inflammatory disorder Any clinical , image , laboratory finding raise suspicion infection Minors Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) &gt; 15 mm/hr male less 50 year old , &gt; 20 mm/hr male great 50 year old female less 50 year old , &gt; 30 mm/hr female great 50 year old C reactive protein ( CRP ) &gt; 1 mg/d , Procalcitonin ( PCT ) &gt; 0.05 ng/ml .</criteria>
