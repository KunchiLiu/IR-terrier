	<detailed_description>Background : Patients symptoms sign ischemia refer coronary angiography ( CAG ) CT angiography ( CT-CAG ) . A significant proportion patient especially woman appear obstructive coronary stenosis . Patients angina-like symptom macrovascular coronary stenosis previously consider without increase risk major cardiovascular event , novel data indicate assumption may true . Abnormal coronary flow metabolic response stress report , consistent possible microvascular ethology symptom . Both endothelium- non-endothelium dependent impair coronary reactivity may contribute . The endothelium dependent component link risk factor pro-inflammatory process promote atherosclerosis . The non-endothelium dependent mechanism may involve vascular smooth muscle cell , undergo alteration phenotype response physiological pathophysiological stimulus like hypertension diabetes . Both invasive non-invasive diagnostic method available assessment coronary microvascular dysfunction . In absence flow limit stenosis upstream , indirect measurement possible use transthoracic Doppler stress echocardiography ( TTDSE ) . TTDSE provide assessment coronary blood flow velocity one major coronary vessel use determine coronary flow velocity reserve ( CFR ) hyperemia . This method primarily ass non-endothelium dependent component coronary microvascular dysfunction . Despite reassurance stenosis major coronary vessel find , many patient continue chest pain result emergency visit , hospitalization repeat cardiac catheterization adverse effect quality life , employment health care cost . Treatment option patient angina symptom lack macrovascular coronary stenosis find . Standard anti-angina treatment usually try , relieve symptom many patient . Preclinical study Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) GLP-1 receptor ( GLP-1R ) agonists demonstrate cardioprotective effect . However , underlie mechanism often well define . Many study distinguish direct versus indirect action GLP-1R agonist , take account potential action cleavage product , GLP-1 . GLP-1R find atrial cardiomyocytes animal model sinoatrial node human . Furthermore endothelial cell vascular smooth muscle cell seem target GLP-1 action . In animal model GLP-1 promote myocardial glucose uptake independent insulin , increase contractility coronary flow improve outcome survival myocardial infarction vivo . Limited data exists cardioprotective effect GLP-1 human . A study evaluate effect GLP-1 patient present acute myocardial infarction stenosis major coronary vessel , whereas data exists effect patient stable coronary artery disease . Two randomized study investigate effect GLP-1 infusion ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction , find reduce infarct size three month follow-up . Several small pilot study patient coronary heart disease find GLP-1 infusion dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor improve leave ventricular ejection fraction . None human trial involve prolonged treatment GLP-1 . Data previous work suggest GLP-1 weight loss may beneficial effect microvascular circulation cardiovascular risk factor . In small cross-over study 20 patient type2 diabetes angina , 10 week GLP1-R agonist treatment ( Liraglutide , 1,2 mg/day ) lead small insignificant improvement coronary microcirculation , concomitant significant decrease body weight blood pressure improvement glycemic control . Another study include overweight patient ischemic heart disease find , mean weight loss 10.6 % achieve low energy diet improve microvascular function ( CFR ) coronary risk factor blood pressure , lipid profile , glycemic control ( non-diabetics ) well symptom . Thus data cardioprotective effect long-term treatment GLP-1 human sparse , may speculate beneficial effect may due weight lower effect . Objective The aim present study evaluate effect treatment Liraglutide coronary microvasculature angina symptom , overweight patient microvascular dysfunction ( CFR≤2,5 ) angina pectoris coronary artery stenosis . Hypothesis Liraglutide improve microvascular function alleviates symptoms woman angina pectoris microvascular coronary dysfunction , obstructive stenosis major coronary vessel . Design An open label trial consist four-weeks control period without intervention , follow Liraglutide 3 mg daily 12 week + 2 week weight maintenance diet . Study participant serve control first four week receive treatment . Outcome parameter measure baseline 4 18 week . The first two measurement ( baseline four week measurement ) way serve documentation variance repeat measurement . Blinding participant investigator possible due study setup , investigator blind pre- posttreatment measurement analyse result end study . Furthermore investigator blind previous CFR measurement data collection . Study drug Liraglutide daily human GLP-1 analogue 97 % linear amino-acid sequence homology human GLP-1 . Liraglutide work stimulate release insulin glucose level become high inhibiting appetite . It lower blood glucose unique advantage glucose lower cease blood glucose get normal range . Liraglutide approve EU US treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus dose 1,8 mg administer subcutaneously daily . Recently US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) approve Liraglutide obesity treatment . The indication adjunct lifestyle modification chronic weight management individual body mass index ( BMI ) ≥30 kg/m2 , BMI≥27 kg/m2 least one weight-related comorbidity dysglycaemia ( pre-diabetes type 2 diabetes mellitus ) , hypertension , dyslipidaemia obstructive sleep apnoea . The max dose obesity treatment 3.0 mg daily . When prescribed aim weight loss , Liraglutide administrate subcutaneously titrate maximally recommended dosage obesity . By treat participant indication overweight interference antihyperglycemic medication avoid . Treatment initiate 0.6 mg daily one week increase weekly recommend max dose 3 mg . If possible reach maximal dosage due adverse effect , participant stay high dose tolerate . Participants exclude tolerate treatment dose least 1.2 mg Liraglutide per day , since low dosage unlikely result weight loss least 5 % .Treatment duration 12 week last two week consist weight maintenance diet outcome measurement do . On dosage duration weight loss least 5 % expect . Participants advise reduce calorie intake increase physical activity . Control compliance make visit telephone call ( structure open question interview ) Furthermore participant note every time medication take diary . Participants Study participant recruit ongoing multicenter study woman symptom sign angina pectoris , 'Improving diagnosis treatment woman angina pectoris microvascular disease ( iPower ) ' . Before inclusion iPower study , participant undergone CAG CT-CAG significant stenosis major coronary vessel . As part iPower study coronary flow reserve measure transthoracic doppler stress echocardiography dipyridamole induces stress . Diagnostic method Fasting blood sample collect . Some blood sample store biobank . Blood sample store end study ( last patient , last visit ) plus five year , blood sample destroy thereafter . Angina symptom assess Seattle Angina Questionnaire ( SAQ ) 19-item health-related quality-of-life measure patient coronary artery disease . A score change 10 point clinically perceptible patient consider clinically relevant difference , substantial change consider change 20 point . Echocardiographic measurement CFR , systolic diastolic function include strain do rest dipyridamole induce stress . CFR calculate ratio coronary flow velocity hyperemia rest . Coronary microvascular dysfunction define CFR &lt; 2.5 . Endothelial function measure flow mediate dilation ( FMD ) . Peripheral endothelial function correlate well coronary endothelial function . A whole body dual X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan perform baseline 18 week estimate body composition . Statistics There two main outcome : Microvascular function assess CFR symptom burden assess SAQ . CFR continuous response variable . A difference repeat measurement within subject find normally distributed standard deviation 0.35 . If mean change CFR post treatment 0.23 , investigator need study 27 subject able reject null hypothesis change mean CFR probability ( power ) 0.9 . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.05 . At least 33 participant include anticipation around 20 % drop-out . SAQ four subscales score 1-100 . According previous study change SAQ score 10 point perceptible patient therefore clinically meaningful . The investigator find data within-study subject variation SAQ . However , previous trial obtain change SAQ 10-20 point intervention . Based finding investigator expect see change SAQ score least 10 point . By estimate SD 15 , calculate 26 study subject sufficient attain statistical power &gt; 90 % detect significant difference 10 point post treatment SAQ item . For remain secondary outcome , response normally distribute , investigator able detect true difference mean response participant 0.66 x SD within group change probability ( power ) 0.9 . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis , population mean unchanged intervention , 0.05 . Monitoring : The study monitor unit Good Clinical Practice ( GCP-unit ) University Copenhagen . Quality check data , data registry procedure source data verification perform GCP-unit .</detailed_description>
