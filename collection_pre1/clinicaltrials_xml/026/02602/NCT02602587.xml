	<brief_summary>Dendrogenin A present mammal normal tissue fluid , notably blood . It down-represented absent cancer cell line tumor . In opposite , OCDO accumulate cancerous condition virtually absent normal tissue . This study try determine modulation oxysterols protein involved metabolism Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient sample normal blood marrow , evaluation marker companion biomarkers Dendrogenin A treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Dendrogenin A / Oxysterols Balance Between Healthy Volunteers Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Acute myeloid leukemia unmet medical need since 5-year overall survival 40-50 % young adults 10-15 % elderly . Dendrogenin A natural novel anticancer agent show potent antileukemic activity under-represented tumor . Dendrogenin A inhibits Cholesterol epoxide hydrolase modulates level substrate product enzymatic complex . Purpose : This biomedical study interventional type include 30 patient 30 blood sample well 5 marrow sample healthy donor . It last 24 month , 8 month recruit 16 month follow-up . Patients acute myeloid leukemia indication chemotherapy treatment retain enrol study . This study compare oxysterols ( Dendrogenin A , 6-oxo-cholestane-3beta,5alpha-diol - OCDO ) relate proteins biomarkers disease two population . Interventions : The patient include study process accord standard treatment force disease . This study way interfere treatment regimen , base additional sample blood bone marrow act plan prognostic follow-up protocol . Treatment shall start within 15 day follow inclusion first sample .</detailed_description>
