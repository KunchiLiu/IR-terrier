	<brief_summary>Objective : The effect weekly professional oral care composition oral flora dentate , dependent elderly resident follow 12-month period . Background : Long-term , regular professional oral hygiene care reduce total number microorganisms oral disease-related microorganism . Less known effect quality/composition remain oral flora . Materials method : Thirty-three subject include study group 35 control group . Dental status , presence supragingival-plaque , labial minor gland secretion rate , prescription medicine record . Microbial sample , collect supragingival plaque dorsum tongue , analyze use cultivation technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ethics statement The study approve Ethics Committee University Gothenburg , Sweden ( Permit Number 039/00 ) . Study control group After give informed write consent participate , either subject relative guardian , 68 subject recruit two nursing home elderly person . The nursing home , belong institution leadership , situated area city . The study group recruit one nursing home consist 21 woman 12 men . The control group , recruit second nursing home , consist 23 woman 12 men . To include study , subject least 10 natural teeth removable denture able follow simple instruction , open close mouth . The subject include study order give inform consent fulfil inclusion criterion . Throughout study period , subject group eligible dental care dependent individual , regulate law Sweden , include oral health care assessment free charge , basic dental care subsidize rate , nursing home personnel train oral health care . Intervention The study group receive professional oral care , week throughout 12-month study period , either two dental hygienist . The oral care carry residents´ private room participant sit his/her chair lie bed . The treatment include brush teeth , labial lingual side , use electric toothbrush ( Oral-B Professional Care 7000 ) 1100 ppm sodium fluoride dentifrice ( Zendium Classic , Opus Health Care AB/Zendium ) . Inter-dental cleaning carry use inter-dental brush ( TePe : TePe , Malmö , Sweden ) toothpick ( TePe Birch : TePe , Malmö , Sweden ) . Information train oral hygiene procedure give study group capable understand instruction . At start intervention , subject study group , well main responsible nursing aid , receive electric toothbrush kind use two dental hygienist ( Oral-B Professional Care 7000 ) , instruction train use brush . In control group , oral health care procedure follow ordinary routine department . Collection clinical data sample microbial analysis Clinical examination , measurement labial minor gland salivary secretion rate , microbial sampling perform 9 12 ( author KL K ) carry residents´ private room . All microbial sampling perform duplicate , one week apart . The clinical examination perform first two duplicate sampling occasion . Plaque registration follow collection supragingival plaque microbial analysis perform four site , order . The site select interproximally upper right first second molar , low leave first second molar , upper right second incisor canine , low leave second incisor canine . If one teeth miss , close available site select . The measurement labial minor gland salivary secretion rate , follow microbial sampling tongue , perform order end registration sample session . In study control group , clinical data , data prescription medicine , labial minor gland salivary secretion rate , microbial sample collect baseline end 12-month study period . In study group , additional plaque registration sample microbial analysis perform 3 , 6 , 9 month baseline . Clinical examination The clinical examination carry , light adjustable headlight , use dental mirror dental probe . The number natural teeth , clinically visible caries lesion plaque record . Plaque record visible plaque ( score 0 ) , visible thin plaque ( score 1 ) visible thick plaque ( score 2 ) . A mean plaque score record four interproximal site select registration calculate . Prescription medicine Data prescription medicine collect residents´ medical record . Labial minor gland salivary secretion rate For measurement labial minor gland salivary secretion rate , perform describe Eliasson et al. , area lower labial mucosa gently dry cotton pad . A pre-cut piece standard filter paper place 15 near midline approximately 3 mm out border mucosa . The volume liquid absorb filter paper measure use calibrate Periotron® ( 8000 , ProFlow™ Inc. , Amityville , NY , USA ) . At examination , four sample collect subject individual mean calculate . Microbial sample analysis Microbial sample collect supragingival plaque dorsum tongue . An experienced laboratory assistant blind group subject , study control group , examination occasion sample collect , analyzed sample . The supragingival plaque sample collect use sterile toothpick ( TePe Birch ) pool . The tongue sample collect use sterile tweezer , cotton pellet plastic spatula . The spatula , circular hole 1.5 cm diameter , place back part dorsum . A cotton pellet , immerse sample fluid , swept area inside hole . The two sample transfer 3.5 ml transport medium VMGA III process within four hour . The analysis sample perform previously describe use enriched blood agar plate selective agar plate . The total number microorganism grow anaerobic condition , total number proportion streptococci number proportion Streptococcus sanguinis/oralis Streptococcus salivarius , associate good oral health , mutans streptococci , lactobacilli Actinomyces spp , associate dental caries , F. nucleatum , P. intermedia/nigrescens , associate gingival inflammation , P. gingivalis A. actinomycetemcomitans , associate periodontitis , Candida albicans , Staphylococcus aureus , enteric rod , associate mucosal aspiratory infection , calculate . The detection limit 100 colony-forming unit specie except A. actinomycetemcomitans , detection limit 10 colony-forming unit . If possible , number microorganism calculate number plate give 30 - 300 colony . A mean result duplicate sampling calculate . Statistical method To normalize microbial data , number transform logarithmically . Zero count treat one colony form unit/ml . Mean median value standard deviation calculate . One-way ANOVA use analysis difference study control group . Two-way ANOVA use statistical analysis difference different time point within two group . Results regard statistically significant p-values &lt; 0.05 . Owing multiple influence aspect , isolated significance interpret caution .</detailed_description>
