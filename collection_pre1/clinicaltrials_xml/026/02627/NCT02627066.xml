	<brief_summary>This 12 month randomize clinical trial patient renal failure undergo maintenance hemodialysis ( MHD ) therapy place volume reduction protocol include novel low sodium dietary education program mediate lifestyle interventionist significant collaboration exist clinic staff . Participating patient randomized receive : 1 ) volume control protocol alone ( VC ) , 2 ) volume control protocol + physical activity exercise counseling ( VCE ) lifestyle interventionist ( LI ) . A research dietitian ( RD ) , work collaboration exist clinic RD , develop program immerse clinic culture sodium restriction . The research RD train LI clinic staff ( nurse , technician , etc ) help disseminate program , model clinic-wide dissemination approach use Izmir , Turkey ( Dr. Ercan Ok ) . In addition , LI provide exercise physical activity counsel participant randomize exercise group , utilize SCT-based approach . The Investigators hypothesize mean arterial pressure reduce , physical function increase , patient 12 month , magnitude improvement great VCE group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Cardiovascular Health Physical Function Hemodialysis Patients Through Volume Control Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients kidney failure require regular hemodialysis ( HD ) therapy 3-4 day per week filter blood remove excess fluid . However , dialysis process inefficient , typically remove fluid waste product accumulate patient since last treatment . This accumulation excess fluid call volume overload ( VO ) . Chronic VO adverse effect heart artery , primarily increase blood pressure , eventually lead enlargement heart cardiac dysfunction ( 1-3 ) . Some evidence also suggest adversely impact patient 's physical activity level function . Past research show patient 's fluid volume control use 'volume control ' strategy . These strategy involve progressively reduce patient 's post-dialysis body weight slowly increase amount fluid remove dialysis session ( e.g. , remove extra 200-300ml fluid session ) . Patient 's dietary sodium intake simultaneously restrict control thirst prevent fluid intake accumulation treatment . Stringent volume control show improve cardiovascular health reduce mortality ( 2-3 ) , rarely/never practice U.S. dialysis clinic . Instead , patient U.S. normally provide blood pressure medication help mitigate effect excessive fluid accumulation session . However , little evidence medication efficacious , impact fluid accumulation per se . Moreover , dietary sodium restriction , principle component successful volume reduction strategy , often require comprehensive change individual 's diet due pervasive inclusion salt U.S. food supply . Registered dietitian provide majority nutrition counsel HD patient , lack time provide level care need sustain patient 's dietary change . As result , chronic volume overload common problem U.S. dialysis patient , establish protocol manage problem pharmacological intervention proven efficacy . The investigator propose multifactorial intervention design improve HD patient 's cardiovascular health physical function . The intervention include novel volume control protocol may combine exercise training optimize benefit volume control strategy . HD patient select clinic randomly assign : 1 ) volume control protocol ( VC ) ; 2 ) VC + exercise training ( VCE ) . The VC protocol include 2 primary component : 1 ) progressive increase amount fluid remove patient 's dialysis treatment ( ultrafiltration volume ) discretion patient 's physician , 2 ) dietary intervention improve patient 's food choice , focus reduce intake fast process food high sodium , well phosphorus additive may also damage effect heart , artery , bone . The dietary intervention involve train exist clinic staff help deliver good consistent nutritional message patient , supplement work exist clinic dietitian . Patients randomized exercise group ( VCE ) receive VC intervention addition personalize exercise train physical activity prescription `` lifestyle interventionist '' ( LI ) . This include exercise dialysis treatment , well counsel increase physical activity level outside clinic - namely home community . The LI also help deliver nutritional education component VC protocol . As HD clinic typically employ one full time register dietitian , LI work closely support work . The LI focus basic nutrition message include decrease intake fast process food , ensure regular meal , adequate protein intake . This education conduct accord Fresenius Tech Talk model . Short in-services hold clinic staff educate general nutrition principle . Staff encourage incorporate talk point patient conversation . Outcomes evaluated LI baseline , 6 12 month . Primary outcome include mean arterial blood pressure physical function . Secondary outcome include : hospitalization rate , cardiovascular function , dialysis compliance , fall incidence , blood pressure medication prescription . This study provide novel information regard effect novel volume control strategy exercise training physical function cardiovascular health HD patient . Results study enable nephrologists make informed decision regard extent low-cost treatment strategy include component standard care clinic . Ultimately , could lead great use treatment strategy result significant improvement health quality life critically ill patient population .</detailed_description>
