	<brief_title>How Safe Effective Micropulse Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation Patients With Uncontrolled Glaucoma ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If subject agree participate study , he/she come screen visit make sure qualify study . Following surgical procedure , principal investigator perform standard postoperative examination Day 1 , Week 1 , Month 1 , Month 3 , Month 6 Month 12 , addition visit investigator feel may necessary . Screening Visit : At screen visit , subject medical history current medication review . Pre-operative eye pressure visual acuity note . The Kowa FM-500 laser flare meter slit lamp ( table-top microscope use examine eye ) use measure inflammation subject anterior chamber ( fluid-filled space iris ( colored part eye ) cornea ( clear front part eye cover iris pupil ) . Surgery : On day subject surgery , subject undergo standard procedure transscleral cyclophotocoagulation ( TSCPC ) laser surgery use micropulse delivery mode diode laser . After Principal investigator finish laser , he/she perform anterior chamber paracentesis , help reduce pressure subject eye quickly temporarily . To , principal investigator puncture cornea ( clear front part eye transmit focus light eye ) remove aqueous ( fluid inside eye ) . Paracentesis usually do TSCPC perform use `` continuous '' delivery mode . Post-Operative Exams : At post-operative office visit ( Day 1 , Week 1 , Months 1 , 3 , 6 12 ) detail medical/eye history take , include current medication , vision test eye examination perform , include measurement eye pressure . Subject ask his/her comfort level regard pain . At visit Day 1 Month 1 amount anterior chamber inflammation measure ( describe Screening Visit ) .</detailed_description>
