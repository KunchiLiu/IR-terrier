	<brief_summary>Background : Malaria still health problem Sub-Saharan Africa . Death rate stable even increase area . There malaria vaccine . However , researcher think repeat immunization vaccine call PfSPZ may work well . Objective : To see PfSPZ safe , tolerable , effective malaria . Eligibility : Healthy adult age 18 50 year live Doneguebougou area Mali Design : Participants screen medical history physical exam . Participants sign fingerprint consent form . They take survey see well understand study . Participants give blood urine sample . Participants least one ECG : Soft electrode stuck skin . A machine record heart signal . Participants HIV counseling . Participants assign group . Groups get different strength dos . Groups get different number vaccine different period time . If participant develop rash injection site reaction , photograph may take . Participants receive oral anti-malaria drug study . Participants monitor 3 6 month last vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Immunogenicity , Protective Efficacy Radiation Attenuated Plasmodium Falciparum NF54 Sporozoites ( PfSPZ Vaccine ) Healthy African Adults Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It known human protect malaria repeat immunization radiation-attenuated sporozoite . Traditionally , sporozoite administer expose vaccinee least 1000 bite sporozoite-infected irradiated mosquito , approach unsuitable mass vaccination campaign . Recently , Sanaria , Inc. develop process manufacturing , compliance current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMPs ) aseptic , purify , radiation attenuate cryopreserved sporozoite well-characterized isolate P. falciparum . This product , call PfSPZ Vaccine , administer needle syringe . Previous study conduct Vaccine Research Center Navy establish IV administration PfSPZ Vaccine induce sterile protection control human malaria infection ( CHMI ) homologous strain P. falciparum 100 % malaria na ( SqrRoot ) individual . A recent study conduct collaboration among Malaria Research Training Center ( MRTC , Mali ) , Laboratory Malaria Immunology Vaccinology ( LMIV ) National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , Sanaria , Inc. show sterile protection naturally occur malaria infection achieve , level see US level desire . The next logical step attempt improve protective efficacy target endemic population increase PfSPZ Vaccine dose , increase interval first second dos 8 week ( do WRAIR 2080 group receive 3 dos 4.5x105 PfSPZ ) , reduce number dos three . Additionally , study design , also begin understand standard control human malaria infection ( CHMI ) model may use field start explore impact factor malaria co-infection drug treatment vaccine response . The initial dose escalation pilot study focus safety tolerability PfSPZ Vaccine . A defined number subject enrol pilot study also undergo evaluation , include randomization receive receive drug treatment immediately prior vaccination examination protective efficacy homologous CHMI via PfSPZ Challenge . The targeted dose ( 18x105 PfSPZ Vaccine ) , safe tolerable , administer large cohort double blind , randomize , placebo control trial examine protective efficacy vaccine naturally occur infection . Subjects recruit rural village Mali . The study conduct collaboration among MRTC , LMIV/NIAID , Sanaria , Inc .</detailed_description>
