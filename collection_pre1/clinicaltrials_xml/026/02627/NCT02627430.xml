	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose talazoparib heat shock protein ( HSP ) 90 inhibitor AT13387 give together treat patient solid tumor spread place body ( metastatic ) ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal , hormone negative breast cancer come back period improvement ( recurrent ) . Talazoparib HSp90 inhibitor AT13387 may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need cell growth . HSp90 inhibitor AT1338 may also help talazoparib work well make tumor cell sensitive drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTDs ) BMN673 ( talazoparib ) AT13387 ( HSP90 Inhibitor AT13387 ) administer combination patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) toxicity associate BMN673 AT13387 administer combination assessed Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4.0 . II . To determine recommended phase 2 dos ( RP2D ) combination BMN673 AT13387 . III . To determine plasma pharmacokinetics BMN673 AT13387 . IV . To document anti-tumor activity combination BMN673 AT13387 assess ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 progression free survival ( PFS ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive talazoparib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 ( course 0 ) . Beginning course 1 , patient receive talazoparib PO QD day 1-28 HSP90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
