	<detailed_description>The main purpose project determine impact atrial fibrillation intervention ( catheter ablation exercise training ) circulate BDNF concentration patient atrial fibrillation . It also seek determine relation circulate BDNF concentration mental health ( depression severity , quality life symptom ) among undergoing intervention atrial fibrillation catheter ablation exercise training . Using pre-post study design , investigator explore intervention two subset patient opposite end atrial fibrillation clinical spectrum . Arm 1 : patient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergo catheter ablation ( n=100 ) . Arm 2 : patient permanent persistent atrial fibrillation perform exercise training 2 time weekly 12 week ( n=100 ) . Total sample size 200 participant . All measurement perform baseline follow-up .</detailed_description>
