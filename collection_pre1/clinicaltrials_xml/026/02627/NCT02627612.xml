In perfect situation , practitioner could simply track `` risk '' individual throughout military service ensure receive medical service Veterans Affairs transition civilian sector . It would appear approach would help reduce suicide Veterans since study show Vietnam Veterans posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) diagnosis approximately forty year Vietnam ( i.e. , worsen chronic high-stable ) almost 3 time likely suicide attempt compare Veterans without PTSD . Additionally , suicide rate Veterans actually seek VA healthcare service improve recent year ( approximately 34 per 100,000 2008 approximately 28 per 100,000 2010 ) . This testament service VA provide Veterans seek care . Unfortunately , approach fully successful two reason . First , many transition Veterans need service seek service primarily prevalent stigma mental health service among Veterans . For example , previous research find 34 percent National Guard Veterans screen positive PTSD deployment Afghanistan actually seek treatment within first year redeploy home transition back civilian sector . It important note 1.7 million Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OEF/OIF ) Veterans eligible Veteran Affairs ( VA ) service 58 percent ( 998,004 ) ever utilized service . Second , approach take consideration cumulative impact upon Veterans lose protective factor leadership social support transition civilian sector compound effect transition stressor upon Service Members . For example , possible Veterans could within low-stable resilience trajectory experience protective factor leadership social support military worsen factor dissipate transition stressor take effect . In fact , longitudinal study National Guard Service Members ascertain impact transition stressor ( i.e. , issue employment financial difficulty , issue relate housing , issue relate marital family problem ) upon Veterans return combat transition back civilian sector .

The frequently report interest related Veteran Affairs benefit ( 83 percent survey ) schooling , employment , job training ( 80 percent survey ) . These two reason together may help explain suicide rate Veterans seek service VA , transition civilian sector , rise within last year approximately 34 per 100,000 2008 approximately 39 per 100,000 2010 . It appear risk young Veterans ( 18-24 year old ) . The suicide rate young Veterans use VA service spike 46.1 per 100,000 2009 79.1 per 100,000 2011 . The investigator assume rate young Veterans n't ever use VA service even significantly high . This mean among 42 percent ( 726,054 ) OEF/OIF Veterans n't ever use service could possibly riskiest Veterans suicide . This major concern constitute research study refer `` Deadly Gap '' , consist time military service Veteran successful transition back civilian sector . In try develop intervention address concern list , investigator review already establish program within military successful program within civilian sector .
