	<brief_summary>The administration Ticagrelor demonstrate superiority Clopidogrel patient present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) remain first line therapy adjunct aspirin patient admit ACS . The patient population treat Ticagrelor early time point include non ST elevation myocardial ( NSTEMI ) patient undergo primary angioplasty ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . It estimate 10-15 % patient present ACS advance coronary artery disease require Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ( CABG ) . The treatment guideline recommend delay 5-7 day CABG surgery patient normalization Ticagrelor induce platelet inhibition reduce risk peri-operative bleeding . This delay may expose high risk patient adverse cardiac event wait Ticagrelor effect wean . Furthermore , empirical application 5-7 day delay patient may unnecessary due significant inter individual variability response Ticagrelor . There limited data determine optimum time CABG surgery ACS patient treat Ticagrelor . The present study determine optimum time CABG ACS patient treat load and/or maintenance dose Ticagrelor .</brief_summary>
