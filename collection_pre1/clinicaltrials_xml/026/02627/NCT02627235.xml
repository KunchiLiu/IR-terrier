	<brief_title>The Deep South IVR-based Active Lifestyle Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 participant receive DIAL intervention Wait List Control . While main outcome focus feasibility acceptability , physical activity , fitness , body weight composition data collect measured baseline 12-weeks . DIAL Intervention : The physical activity intervention base Social Cognitive Theory emphasize behavioral strategy increase activity level ( i.e. , goal setting , self-monitoring , problem solve barrier , increase social support , reward oneself meet physical activity goal ) include daily activity reporting via Individual Voice Response ( IVR ) system allow computer-assisted interaction participant telephone . Computer expert system feedback physical activity progress base participant ' report daily step count &gt; moderate intensity PA . In addition IVR system feedback , participant receive monthly graphic-based feedback letter deliver mail . Messages encourage incremental increase national PA guideline reach provide specific information cancer risk reduction ( `` In past 7 day , call DIAL study line 7 day report engage 80 minute moderate intensity PA . The national guideline call &gt; 150 min/week moderate intensity PA well way . Keep good work . Make small increase PA week reach goal . Remember : 30-60 min/day moderate-vigorous intensity PA may significantly low risk breast colon cancer '' ) . To improve self-efficacy , social support , outcome expectation , perceive enjoyment , assess variable baseline , 30 , 60 , 90 day . Responses use select appropriate tailor feedback module ( low self-efficacy score , `` You seem confident ability exercise . Often try fit PA top demand work family challenge . Try make time 10 minute walk 1-2 day week . It help build confidence ability fit PA lifestyle . '' ) Finally , participant receive access problem solve module , address PA barrier identify community formative research ( lack time , negative outcome expectation , enjoyment , social support , see table ) . Module option rotate constantly update keep participant engage . Wait List Control Condition : Will receive intervention 12 week follow baseline assessment .</detailed_description>
