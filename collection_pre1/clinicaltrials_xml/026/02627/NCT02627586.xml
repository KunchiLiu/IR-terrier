However , effect patient recent myocardial infarction currently unknown . In patient avoidance negative remodel acute myocardial infarction upmost importance . Therefore , assessment influence HIIT post-infarct leave ventricular-remodeling urgently need . Therefore , aim study determine effect HIIT leave ventricular ( LV ) remodeling ( measure LV end diastolic volume ) compare effect establish MICE train modality . Further measurement include parameter LV remodeling ( LV contractility , brain natriuretic peptide ) , prognostic parameter ( peak oxygen uptake , exercise capacity ) , cardiac output , endothelial function , leg muscle function score quality life . Further , certain blood parameter heart rate variability measure electro-cardiogram measured ass safety type training . Patients first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) equivalent onset symptom ischemia treat primary percutaneous intervention within precede 4 week include . The HIIT MICE integrate 12-week exercise training program Inselspital Bern , consist 1 ) exercise training , 2 ) nutrition counsel 3 ) psychotherapy . The exercise program comprise 3 weekly exercise session last 90 minute , supervise experienced exercise therapist . The program focus endurance type exercise , strengthen relaxation exercise well exercise improve coordination skill . In first 3 week ( run-in-phase ) , patient complete three weekly MICE session . In follow 9 week , patient randomize intervention group perform two weekly HIIT session one MICE session per week . The control group continue three weekly MICE session 9 week intervention phase . A total 144 patient recruit . Measurements perform baseline , 3-week run-in-phase , 9-week intervention phase . Safety measurement perform 4th 12th week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Intensity Interval Training Early After Left Ventricular Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Several study show high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) effective moderate-intensity continuous exercise training ( MICE ) improve functional capacity quality life stable cardiac patient perform safely . It therefore emerge new important exercise modality cardiac rehabilitation centre Europe stable heart failure patient LV dysfunction . Its safety efficacy yet test patient acute LV dysfunction due myocardial infarction . In clinical practice , difference acute chronic leave ventricular dysfunction often make patient condition recent myocardial infarction LV dysfunction might offer training regimen patient chronic heart failure , include HIIT , although effect post-infarction remodel unknown . On hand , avoidance negative remodel acute myocardial infarction upmost importance . Therefore , assessment influence HIIT post-infarct LV-remodeling urgently need . Objective To determine effect HIIT leave ventricular remodelling ( measured end diastolic volume ) compare effect establish MICE train modality patient recent myocardial infarction LV dysfunction . Methods After 3-week run-in phase MICE training patient , patient randomise HIIT group perform two HIIT one MICE session per week MICE group perform 3 MICE session per week . Outcomes assess 9-week intervention . End diastolic volume measure 2-dimensional echography , peak oxygen uptake ( peak VO2 ) exercise capacity cardiopulmonary exercise test cycle ergometer , quality life questionnaire , vascular function arterial stiffness measurement , leg muscle cross-sectional area peripheral quantitative compute tomography , leg muscle function jump mechanography . During 4th 12th week rehabilitation training , heart rate variability measure morning follow training , blood sample take train session analyse marker myocardial stress ( Troponin T , MR-proANP , BNP ) .</detailed_description>
