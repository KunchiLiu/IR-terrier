	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 , open-label , randomize , control , multi-national , multi-center , parallel-arm study compare tivozanib sorafenib subject refractory advance renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) treatment tivozanib sorafenib . Subjects stratified International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium ( IMDC ) risk category ( favorable ; intermediate ; poor ) prior therapy ( two prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( VEGFR TKI ) ; prior checkpoint inhibitor [ program cell death -1 protein ( PD-1 ) PD-1 ligand ( PD1-L ) inhibitor ] plus prior VEGFR TKI ; prior VEGFR TKI plus systemic agent ) . All subject evaluate progression free survival , overall survival , objective response rate , duration response well safety tolerability . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis also include study .</brief_summary>
