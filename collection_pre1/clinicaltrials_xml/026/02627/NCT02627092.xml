	<brief_title>IMPACT STUDY : Investigating Microbial Pathogen Activity Copper Textiles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthcare-associated infection ( HAIs ) , particularly due multidrug-resistant organism ( MDROs ) , great clinical public health concern . Although evidence-based prevention strategy result success curtailing HAIs , novel approach need achieve reduction . Efforts curb emergence MDROs largely unsuccessful . Thus , new strategy address MDROs urgently need . This grant comprise two complementary study focus identify innovative approach effectively prevent HAIs curtail emergence MDROs . We conduct randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) ass efficacy copper oxide-impregnated textile prevent HAIs MDROs well reduce environmental microbial contamination . We hope provide critical information inform development novel strategy , enhance impact exist strategy , successfully address HAIs MDROs . For approximately four month hospital conduct research study learn possible impact copper linens reduce hospital acquire infection . Some room copper linen ( Group 1 ) room regular linen ( Group 2 ) . The linen comprise top bottom sheet , pillowcase cover , hospital gown . Patients group ask provide sample stay ICU . For study group , linen sample twice place . This occur 2 consecutive day . At time , study staff take sample several area room ( hand rail , overbed table , nurse call button ) . Patients also ask allow research team obtain swabs nose , per-rectal area , armpit groin . These swab perform first day enrol study , 4 day later , every week ICU discharge .</detailed_description>
