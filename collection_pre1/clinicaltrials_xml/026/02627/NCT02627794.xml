	<detailed_description>Endoscopic sinus surgery ( ESS ) gold standard surgical intervention chronic rhinosinusitis adequately control medical therapy . Synechiae formation middle meatus common complication endoscopic sinus surgery ( 1 ) . Synechiae describes adhesion two oppose mucosal surface nasal cavity cause scar obstruction nasal passage . Incidence synechiae formation varies literature range 4-35 % ( 2 , 3 , 4 ) . Presence middle meatal synechiae impair sinus drainage , promote sinusitis , limit endoscopic visualization sinus cavity postoperatively . This may result difficulty perform postoperative routine endoscopic debridement examination , paramount successful outcome ESS ( 5 ) . To prevent synechiae formation , numerous study publish evaluate effectiveness absorbable non-absorbable spacers place middle meatus 1-2 week postoperatively . The spacer mean prevent contact denude surface middle turbinate lateral nasal wall re-epithelialization . In general , non-resorbable spacers use include sponge , cotton gauze plastic sheet . Of , Silastic Silicone sheet use number hospital across US Canada . Lee ( 6 ) Baguley ( 7 ) demonstrate effectiveness Silastic spacers reduce risk synechiae formation 0-6 % ( 6 , 7 ) . There also number resorbable spacers use , preferred physician minimal need remove pack material naturally remove resorbed healing period . In recent meta-analysis , Lee et al ( 8 ) reveal usage middle meatal spacers ( absorbable non-absorbable ) decrease rate synechiae formation statistically significant degree compare use spacer . However , subgroup analysis perform , non-absorbable spacer usage demonstrate statistically significant low incidence synechiae compare spacers ( 6 ) . This explain part inherent capability absorbable spacer material degrade small size particulate , catch heal tissue , could illicit local inflammatory response slow healing cause synechiae formation . This mechanism demonstrate Maccabee et al ( 9 ) rabbit model , fiber absorbable spacer become incorporated healing mucosa increase extent inflammatory response formation fibrosis . To improve outcome , physician attempt load steroid Triamcinolone ( 10 , 15 ) antibiotic Neosporin ( 11 ) nasal pack and/or stent . However , residence drug intend treatment space minimize drug , bound spacer , quickly release may remain long enough impact inflammatory response . A Mometasone Furoate coat stent ( Propel™ ) , manufacture Intersect ENT , currently drug coat nasal stent claim longer sustained release . In randomized , control , double-blind trial , Marple et al ( 12 ) find Mometasone Furoate steroid-eluting bio-absorbable stent could significantly improve postoperative outcome compare non-steroid elute placebo arm stent . Zhao et al ( 13 ) conduct systematic review efficacy steroid-eluting stent ( Propel ) v inert ( resorbable non-resorbable ) spacers confirm low rate synechiae formation steroid-eluting treatment group . However , anecdotal evidence , base discussion number surgeon field , suggest drug-loaded resorbable spacer may subject issue non-drug-loaded resorbable spacers , namely late stage degradation material cause secondary spike inflammatory cascade , require additional surgical intervention remove remain debris . Therefore , hypothesize steroid elute non-absorbable spacer may provide optimal benefit patient 's outcome . The Restora™ spacer make biocompatible non-resorbable material expect deliver 370 µg Mometasone Furoate . The steroid elute spacer onto surround mucosal tissue 6-8 day period retain . This study design evaluate basic device usability confirm safety effectiveness Restora™ Steroid elute spacer compare standard care Silastic Silicone spacer .</detailed_description>
