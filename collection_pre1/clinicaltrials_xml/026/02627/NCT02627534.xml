	<brief_title>Effects Adjunct Photodynamic Therapy Treatment Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) become global epidemic . Its complication significant impact quality life , longevity , cost public health . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate 2030 , 439 million people suffer diabetes , around 10 % world adult population ( WHO , 2011 ) . Periodontal Diseases consider sixth complication DM . This close relationship disease characterize mutual influence . Thus , appropriate control periodontal disease may facilitate DM control , improve quality life diabetes patient . Besides , presence DM might impair prognosis diverse dental treatment due inflammatory nature , negative influence wound healing , bone biology , establishment infection . Consequently , knowledge new dental therapy biology dental treatment chronic periodontitis diabetic patient enhance quality life make treatment adequate common profile patient . Therefore , aim present study investigate effectiveness antimicrobial photodynamic therapy adjunct full-mouth debridement treatment periodontitis type 2 diabetic patient split-mouth randomized triple-blind clinical trial .</detailed_description>
