	<brief_title>Evaluation The MetaNeb® System Reduce Postoperative Pulmonary Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative pulmonary complication ( PPC ) associate significant excess morbidity , mortality healthcare expenditure . Although PPCs incompletely understand multifactorial syndrome , atelectasis recognize critical component . A variety strategies show reduce risk development post-operative atelectasis include lung expansion ( LE ) therapy . Well-designed study need distinguish LE approach great potential optimize patient care , clinical outcome cost saving . Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation ( IPV ) device use 25 year use widely acute care , post-surgical , homecare set . Such device provide LE airway clearance therapy ( ACT ) patient obstructive and/or restrictive lung disease condition . The MetaNeb® System LE expansion modality incorporate physiological effect IPV provide additional therapeutic advantage intend primarily effectively treat prevent pulmonary atelectasis . The study conduct two stage . In Stage I study , retrospective review medical record post-surgical patient , receive STANDARD THERAPY define current hospital respiratory care department policy procedure perform . In Stage II , CHANGE IN PRACTICE make patient receive standard care addition therapy The MetaNeb® System . Demographic , clinical &amp; outcome data collect eligible patient two stage study . Study staff collect data medical record , follow protocol determine schedule .</detailed_description>
