	<brief_summary>Conventional breast radiotherapy deliver entirety breast fractionate treatment give several week . While technique effective , risk late adverse event irradiation surround normal tissue protract nature treatment inconvenient patient resource-intensive health care system . There unmet need novel treatment deliver quickly , reduce normal tissue exposure , without compromise efficacy . The GammaPod breast-specific radiotherapy delivery device hold promise addressing need . Employing engineering physic principle stereotactic radiotherapy , allow delivery highly-localized radiation dose limited volume breast . The Ottawa Hospital Canadian member consortium five academic institution acquire GammaPod order rigorously evaluate use clinical trial . The aim current project complete mandatory clinical feasibility study GammaPod part application Investigational Testing Medical Devices Health Canada . The study focus use GammaPod deliver radiotherapy boost , , localize dose radiation around surgical bed , single treatment .</brief_summary>
