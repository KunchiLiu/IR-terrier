	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) increase global health problem , primarily increase among female population . The purpose study perform in-depth clinical molecular characterization early stage COPD patient , well healthy never-smoker at-risk smoking control population identify molecularly relate subgroup patient , include gender-related sub-phenotypes COPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) umbrella diagnosis define obstructive lung function impairment , likely cause multitude etiology include environmental exposure , genetic predisposition developmental factor . Due heterogeneity disease , molecular mechanistic sub-phenotyping COPD represent essential step facilitate development relevant diagnostic treatment option constantly grow patient group . In Karolinska COSMIC study , investigator investigate molecular sub-phenotypes smoking-induced COPD . A particular focus relate recent epidemiological indication gender difference incidence severity disease , post-menopausal woman great risk . The study encompass profile mRNA , miRNA , proteome , metabolomes lipid mediator multiple lung compartment ( airway epithelium , alveolar macrophage , exosomes , bronchoalveolar exudate ) use range 'omics platform , combination extensive clinical phenotyping early stage COPD patient , never-smokers , smoker normal lung function gender . The primary objective study identify molecular sub-phenotypes patient COPD , specifically correlate clinical phenotype multi-molecular 'omics profile multiple lung compartment early stage COPD patient compare healthy at-risk control population . Secondary goal involve identification subset prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers classification define subgroup , well relevant pharmaceutical target .</detailed_description>
