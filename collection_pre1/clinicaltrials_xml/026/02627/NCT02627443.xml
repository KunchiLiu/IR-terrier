	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect well carboplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride without ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 work treat patient ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer come back ( recurrent ) spread place body ( metastatic ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving carboplatin gemcitabine without ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may work well treat ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With Without ATR Kinase Inhibitor VX-970 Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability combination therapy carboplatin , gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) VX-970 ( rad3-related [ ATR ] kinase inhibitor VX-970 ) adult woman platinum sensitive recurrent high grade serous high grade endometrioid ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . ( Phase I Dose Escalation/Safety Lead-in ) II . Determine dose triple therapy use randomized phase 2 portion study . ( Phase I Dose Escalation/Safety Lead-in ) III . To determine whether addition VX-970 standard carboplatin/gemcitabine increase progression free survival ( PFS ) compare carboplatin/gemcitabine alone patient first recurrence platinum sensitive high grade serous endometrioid ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube carcinoma . ( Randomized Phase 2 ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition VX-970 carboplatin gemcitabine increase overall survival ( OS ) compare carboplatin gemcitabine alone first recurrence platinum sensitive disease . II . To determine whether addition VX-970 carboplatin gemcitabine increase confirm response rate ( RR ) compare carboplatin gemcitabine alone first recurrence platinum sensitive disease . III . To describe compare adverse event two arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether increased deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage assess multiplex assay correlate response combination therapy VX-970 . II . To determine whether mutation homologous recombination repair gene correlate response combination therapy VX-970 . III . Assess limit pharmacokinetic profile VX-970 gemcitabine give combination carboplatin . IV . To ascertain modulation ATR autophosphorylation pharmacodynamic readout ATR inhibition VX-970 . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study gemcitabine hydrochloride ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 follow phase II study . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 , ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV 60 minute day 2 9 . ARM II : Patients receive carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
