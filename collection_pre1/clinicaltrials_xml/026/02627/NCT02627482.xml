	<brief_summary>Most baby measure small pregnancy bear healthy . However , small grow expect , usually placenta ( baby 's 'life support ' system ) work properly . These baby greatly increase risk die birth , need deliver become poorly . Scans electronic heartrate monitoring currently use monitor baby . But use short period n't always provide enough information show deliver baby . A small light monitor develop safely record baby 's heart rate 16hrs measure electrical activity sticky patch mum 's skin ( like normal ECG ) . The woman carry daily activity wear . Monitoring heart rate long time may help decision time delivery could prevent stillbirth , aim future study . This include large number woman carry small baby . Before investigator investigator need know whether : 1 . Wearing monitor 16hrs practical acceptable pregnant woman 2 . The monitor provide useful information baby 's heart rate different stage pregnancy . Thirty pregnant woman whose baby measure small ask wear monitor two occasion , 16hrs time . The woman describe think wear monitor complete questionnaire . The data monitor download compare woman 's medical note participant deliver baby . Results study publicise help design investigator future study usefulness monitor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : The study design prospective , non randomise , single centre feasibility study determine acceptability reliability Monica AN24 device , method long-term fetal heart rate ( FHR ) monitor one occasion antenatal period . Objectives study : The propose feasibility study aim : 1 . Assess recruitment rate practicality study design protocol . 2 . Evaluate acceptability participant wear device overnight FHR monitor two occasion pregnancy . 3 . Measure success rate generate good quality overnight FHR data identify limitation technique . 4 . Determine response rate questionnaires Recruitment The investigator recruit woman 28 complete week gestation . The investigator study participant two occasion ( 2-4 week apart ) . Being feasibility study FHR data obtain experiment employ routine clinical care study participant whose care follow standard pattern surveillance employ Jessop Wing Hospital ( JW ) , Sheffield . Statistical analysis : As feasibility study investigator employ mainly descriptive analysis . The investigator report rate consent , recruitment acceptability wear AN24 device two occasion . The investigator shall also report rate duration obtain valid FHR data device worn . The feasibility FHR outcome measure summarise inform design future definitive study . Future work clinical impact research : The investigator believe incorporate ambulatory FHR monitoring current method employ monitor SGA could predict prevent stillbirth . This overarch aim future definitive multicentre study require collection longterm FHR data different stage pregnancy least 500 woman carry small baby . Data capture feasibility study inform design main study ensure design robust potential issue identify feasibility study address .</detailed_description>
