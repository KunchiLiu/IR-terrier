	<brief_title>Laser Ablation Versus Mechanochemical Ablation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Varicose vein , common problem UK , may cause symptom include pain , heaviness itch low leg . Overtime , bleed damage surround soft tissue may develop , lead venous ulcer painful , debilitate , difficult heal expensive treat . Newer minimally invasive technique preform use local anaesthetic . The recovery show rapid , due less pain disability compare open surgery . These technique use either heat chemical/medicine inject inside varicose vein close permanently . In 2013 National Institute Health Care Excellence ( NICE ) recommend method use heat endovenous laser ablation ( EVLA ) first choice chemical method show significantly low treatment success rate close varicose vein permanently . Chemical method however advantage , require far few injection local anaesthetic heat method injection source significant discomfort . Since NICE guideline , new treatment technique know mechanochemical ablation ( MOCA ) use ClariVein® develop . This device inject chemical vein rotate hollow wire , cause vein narrow damage line vein , make chemical effective . This new treatment technique aim match success rate heat method , less pain since avoids local anaesthetic injection . Both treatment currently use UK , however insufficient evidence whether one good , . This trial randomly allocate volunteer patient varicose vein treat either EVLA MOCA . The investigator assess range outcome include pain score , success rate , complication , quality-of-life cost see , , treatment offer good result .</detailed_description>
