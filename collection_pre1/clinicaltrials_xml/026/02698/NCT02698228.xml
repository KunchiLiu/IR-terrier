	<brief_title>Regional Anaesthesia Painful Injuries After Disasters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Regional Anaesthesia Painful Injuries Disasters ( RAPID ) study aim evaluate whether regional anesthesia ( RA ) , either without ultrasound ( US ) guidance , reduce pain earthquake-related low limb injury disaster set . The propose study blind , randomize control trial among earthquake victim serious low extremity injury resource-limited setting . After obtain informed consent , study participant randomize 1:1:1 allocation either : standard care ( parenteral morphine 0.1 mg/kg ) ; standard care plus landmark-guided fascia iliaca compartment block ( FICB ) ; standard care plus US-guided femoral nerve block . General practice humanitarian response provider undergo focused training RA perform nerve block 20 ml 0.5 % levobupivacaine . US sham activity use standard care FICB arm normal saline injection give control group blind participant non-research team provider . The primary outcome measure sum pain intensity difference calculate use standard 11-point numerical rating scale report patient 24-hours follow-up . Secondary outcome measure include overall analgesic requirement , adverse event participant satisfaction .</detailed_description>
