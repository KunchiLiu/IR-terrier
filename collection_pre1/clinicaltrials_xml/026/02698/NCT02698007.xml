	<brief_summary>Bronchoscopy method diagnosis treatment common respiratory disease lung recognize many year . Since action take place airway light use sedation , perform , procedure require caution keep potent airway breathe sufficient enough . Most bronchoscopy do without aid equipment advance airway protection . During operation do monitoring hemodynamics : blood pressure , pulse respiratory percutaneous oxygen saturation carbon dioxide . Laryngeal Mask Airway ( LMA ) - tool show effective secure airway respiratory activity positive-pressure ventilation . Several study show use LMA convenient safe perform bronchoscopy airway lung . However , study certain patient group child , immuno-compromised patient . Or benefit safety LMA front intubation bronchoscopy . Our aim ass safety efficacy LMA mechanically ventilate patient undergo flexible elective bronchoscopy . Another objective , examine whether special group patient enjoy LMA others . Patients divide randomly two group alternately order , one patient study group next one control . Study group : LMA insert sedation use procedure . Control group - perform bronchoscopy sedation without LMA . About 50 people need group .</brief_summary>
