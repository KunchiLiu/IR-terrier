	<brief_summary>This protocol design well characterize sub-population peanut sensitize individual may non-allergic , despite significant sensitization , may allergic , high threshold dos . By specifically target participant meet initial screen criterion active adult PN OIT study , Protocol 2012p002153 / AADCRC MGH-004 ( MGH-004 ) , fail react pre-treatment 443 mg challenge peanut , investigator anticipate investigator identify individual become spontaneously tolerant , despite persistent sensitization . The investigator might also find clinical sensitivity persist high threshold , sensitivity increase ( variable ) since previous allergen exposure . By repeat DBPCFCs full serving dose ( 7.4 gram ) , investigator distinguish participant react high dos truly peanut allergic , address whether sensitivity change , opportunity investigate immune response peanut allergen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study identify characterize sub-population peanut sensitize individual allergic peanut characterize immunological phenotype comparison low-threshold peanut allergic individual enrol adult PN OIT study ( 2012P002153/AADCRC MGH-004 ) . The investigator also wish identify characterize sub-population high-threshold peanut-allergic individual clinical reactivity peanut allergen high dos characterize immunological phenotype comparison low-threshold peanut allergic individual enrol adult PN OIT study ( 2012P002153/AADCRC MGH-004 ) . Some The investigator identify high-threshold peanut allergic sensitize , non-allergic individual recruit subject enrol 2012POO2153 failed meet inclusion criterion - specifically , fail objective symptom food challenge cumulative total dose 443 mg . The investigator clarify status conduct double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge peanut , use high dos peanut . The investigator draw blood food challenge , collect urine stool time challenge study immune mechanism . The specific clinical , mechanistic , exploratory objective follow : Clinical Objective : To evaluate clinical status peanut-sensitized individual previously pass DBPCFC 443 mg either : non-allergic , stably high-threshold allergic clinically reactive repeat exposure . Mechanistic Objectives : To determine whether clinical sensitivity peanut allergen ( define elicit dose food challenge ) directly associate relative frequency within peanut-specific regulatory CD4+ CD45RA- T cell subset ( base expression CTLA-4 , FOXP3 , SGMS-1 , FANK-1 validate iTreg signature gene ) DBPCFC 6-8 week DBPCFC . To determine whether clinical sensitivity peanut allergen ( define elicit dose food challenge ) inversely associate relative frequency within peanut-specific Th2 effector CD4+ CD45RA- T cell subset ( base expression GATA-3 , RASGRP1 , IL4R validate Th2 signature gene ) DBPCFC 6-8 week DBPCFC . To determine whether detectable expansion and/or diversification Arah2-specific B cell since previous ( PNOIT2 screen fail ) peanut allergen exposure 6-8 week DBPCFC affinity selection circulate cell NGS BCRs change correlate clinical tolerance DBPCFC . To determine whether extent either mast cell basophil reactivity significantly great among high-threshold peanut allergic participant investigator anticipate identify protocol versus low-threshold peanut allergic participant already identify . Exploratory Objectives : To describe gene expression profile clonal diversity regulatory effector T cell subset among high-threshold peanut allergic participant versus low-threshold peanut allergic patient well understand phenotype ontogeny subset potentially discover new therapeutic pathway . To determine increase mast cell activation detect measurement serum urinary LTE4 course large dose exposure peanut allergen DBPCFC , decrease LTE4 measure marker tolerance . To determine whether microbial dysbiosis associate development desensitization , oral tolerance , persistent gastrointestinal adverse event oral immunotherapy .</detailed_description>
