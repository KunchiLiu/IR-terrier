	<brief_summary>This research study test safety feasibility deliver 4 cycle 'dose-dense ' paclitaxel without use Neulasta ( Pegfilgrastim ) Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) support . The research study participant early stage breast cancer recommend receive standard chemotherapy regimen , doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide ( AC ) plus Paclitaxel ( T ) , call `` dose-dense '' fashion prevent recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low white cell blood count increase risk infection ; thus , order give cycle chemotherapy , white blood cell count must recover adequately cycle . Traditionally , regimen give use medicine call Neulasta ( Pegfilgrastim ) speed recovery white blood cell count order maximize chance next cycle chemotherapy give time . The name study intervention involve study : -- Neulasta ( Pegfilgrastim )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm Stage IIII breast cancer ( define revise , American Joint Committee Cancer 7th edition criterion ) sufficient risk tumor recurrence . Staging study exclude metastatic disease require asymptomatic patient . However , patient finding consider suspicious metastatic disease stag study obtain need evaluate exclude stage IV breast cancer . Patients must deem treat oncologist candidate ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy dose dense AC T. Age ≥ 18 year &lt; 65 time inform consent . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) ≤ 1 . Any grade 3 clinically significant grade 2 treatmentrelated nonhematological toxicity must resolve grade 1 retreatment chemotherapy ( exception alopecia ) Laboratory Evaluations : Adequate blood marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500 µL Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dl Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 Adequate hepatic function define : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.2 institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) Adequate renal function define : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN Premenopausal woman ( include woman tubal ligation woman less 12 month onset menopause ) must negative serum pregnancy test . Patients risk factor Hepatitis B C test ( antihepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen [ HBsAg ] Hepatitis B core antibody ) . Risk factor include : history unprotected sexual intercourse , intravenous drug use , originally endemic region . If infection suspect , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA HCV RNA request appropriate . Note : Patients positive Hepatitis B C serology without know active disease must meet eligibility requirement ALT , AST , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase must normal international normalize ratio ( INR ) least two consecutive occasion , separate least 1 week , within 30 day screen period . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients receive previous cytotoxic chemotherapy include ACT regimen previous therapeutic radiation therapy reason last 5 year . Because possible limitation bone marrow reserve , patient prior treatment appropriate candidate trial . Patients prior hormonal therapy ( instance , tamoxifen prevention breast cancer ) eligible . Patients participate window study ( treatment investigational agent prior surgery ≤2 week ) eligible must discontinue investigational agent least 14 day enrollment . Participants receive investigational agent Have least one prior episode fever neutropenia ( ANC &lt; 500/mm3 expect fall &lt; 500/mm3 ) AC . Patients take lithium . Patients receive chronic treatment oral steroid another immunosuppressive agent ( exclude steroid part chemotherapy premedication emetic medication ) . Known HIVpositive individual immunodeficiency status . Patients history hematologic disease , include myelodysplasia bone marrow malignancy . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Paclitaxel , manage premedication . Currently pregnant breastfeeding . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement significant disease disorder , investigator 's opinion , would exclude subject participate study .</criteria>
