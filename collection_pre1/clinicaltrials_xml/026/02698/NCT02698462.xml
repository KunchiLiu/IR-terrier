	<brief_summary>The aim study identify person advanced neoplasia current national CRC screening , add data family history CRC ( use validate online questionnaire ) FIT . In addition , aim identify person family member participate FIT base screen receive surveillance colonoscopy instead , familial CRC syndrome . It aim increase detection without affect participation , thereby increase yield screening .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adding Family History Colorectal Cancer Dutch FIT-based Screening Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective CRC population-based screening trial , use FIT family history questionnaire , invite positive FIT , familial CRC syndrome , colonoscopy . All invitee receive invitation complete FIT ( FOB-Gold ) validate , online family history questionnaire . Answers questionnaire compare Dutch criterion referral genetic test and/or surveillance colonoscopy persons potential familial risk CRC . Invitees invite perform test , perform one assess . Participants positive FIT ( cut-off value 275 ng/ml ) and/or positive family history diagnosis familial CRC clinical geneticist refer colonoscopy . The investigator compare diagnostic yield , participation rate , positive predictive value two strategy : referral colonoscopy base FIT family history versus referral colonoscopy base FIT-only . The sample size justify anticipated gain diagnostic yield combine FIT-only family history screening . With sample size 6.000 person investigator expect detect 130 person advance neoplasia positive FIT ( 21.7 per 1.000 invitee ) . By add family history questionnaire , investigator anticipate detect additional number 11 person advance neoplasia , result yield combine FIT-based family history screen 141 person advance neoplasia ( 23.5 per 1.000 invitee ) , increase 1.8 per 1.000 invitee . Using McNemar test significance level set 5 % , power 91 % show gain diagnostic yield statistically significant . Previous CRC test screen study use FIT show participation rate approximately 60 % first screen round . The participation rate Dutch national CRC screening 2014 ( first year introduction ) even high , 68 % . The investigator expect 80 % person fill familial risk questionnaire , result 3.264 person perform test . As investigator recommend invitee perform questionnaire addition FIT , investigator assume percentage person fill questionnaire performing FIT negligible . Based previous screen study use FIT positivity cut-off value 50 ng Hb/mL OC-Sensor , assume 8 % participant positive FIT result . In current Dutch screening program , different FIT use ( FOB-Gold ) cut-off value 275 ng Hb/ml . The FIT positivity rate test cut-off value unknown . However , governmental announcement recently report positivity rate expect remain 8 % cut-off value . Therefore , investigator expect 326 FIT positive study ( 8 % 4.080 ) . Based previous study , approximately 40 % person positive FIT result advance neoplasia . In sample concern 130 person . The percentage person familial CRC risk require surveillance colonoscopy screen population varies 2.3 % 4 % . Differences definition increase familial CRC risk could explain variability report number . As investigator use relatively large range criterion fulfil definition familial CRC risk , high report percentage ( 4 % ) assume , concern 131 person . The previously develop family history questionnaire sensitivity 90 % 100 % identifying person qualify referral , two subsequent validation phase respectively . For purpose study , validate questionnaire adjust recently renew referral criterion . The investigator make assumption questionnaire identify person familial CRC syndrome base referral criterion . Persons familial CRC syndrome fulfill criterion miss . This concern unknown number take account . A previous screening study show 6 % positive FIT increase familial CRC risk . One calculate 3.8 % person negative FIT familial CRC risk : 4 % minus 6 % 8 % ( FIT positive ) , divide 92 % ( FIT negative ) . If one assume difference familial CRC risk fill questionnaire , involve 114 3.264 person . Based unpublished data research group estimate 10 % negative FIT familial CRC risk : 11 person ( 10 % 114 ) . A similar percentage find another screening study . Additionally , participant familial CRC syndrome offer surveillance recommendation . In sample , 131 person estimate familial CRC syndrome . Of , 16 person ( 12 % ) undergo colonoscopy due positive FIT ( 6 % 8 % FIT positives ) familial CRC risk could address visit colonoscopy center . The 115 person ( 88 % ) expect negative FIT person ( family member ) would otherwise unlikely identify familial CRC syndrome .</detailed_description>
