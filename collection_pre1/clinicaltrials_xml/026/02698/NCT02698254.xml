	<brief_title>Pilot Trial Dose-Volume Constraints Reirradiation Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , treat radiation . The type radiation use treat determine doctor . Radiation Therapy : If find eligible take part study , dose radiation decide radiation oncologist , use guideline develop study . The dose depend age , type tumor , previous radiation treatment , amount time pass since last course radiation . You sign separate consent form radiation treatment describe radiation administer risk detail . Before begin radiation , call `` simulation '' plan radiation . During simulation , flat back compute tomography ( CT ) table soft plastic mask make help hold head still treatment . This position receive radiation treatment . You CT scan , make computerized image help plan treatment . This take 15 minute . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : At Months 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 25 radiation therapy : - You physical exam . - You MRI check status disease . - You complete questionnaire quality life symptom . Starting 2 year radiation therapy , study staff continue check medical record find health status . Length Treatment : You may receive 6 week radiation therapy . You longer able receive radiation therapy disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your active participation study last study visit ( 25 month radiation ) . This investigational study . Radiation provide accord routine clinical standard use FDA-approved commercially available method . The use second course radiation investigational . Up 30 participant enrol multicenter study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
