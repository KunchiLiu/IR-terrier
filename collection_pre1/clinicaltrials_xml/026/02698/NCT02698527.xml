	<brief_title>The Effect Buffered Lidocaine Versus Nonbuffered Lidocaine Pain Scores During Infiltration Vulvar Biopsies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION : Certain procedure , particularly involve skin , cause pain distress patient . Often , local anesthetic use dull sensation improve patient experience satisfaction . The procedure hand dictate mode delivery anesthetic , typically immediate fast act analgesia require infiltration . Lidocaine amide class local anesthetic commonly use agent infiltration . Lidocaine usually give 1 percent solution combine epinephrine order prolong duration action , decrease local bleeding via local vasoconstriction decrease systemic absorption lidocaine . It well know lidocaine injection painful , likely secondary acidity . A meta analysis publish Cochrane Database 23 trial compare pain infiltration buffer non-buffered lidocaine find patient receive buffered lidocaine report significantly less pain receive non-buffered lidocaine . The decrease pain great patient receive lidocaine epinephrine also present receive lidocaine without epinephrine . The author ' conclusion `` increase pH lidocaine decrease pain injection augment patient comfort satisfaction '' . The study include review however mainly focused laceration , carpal tunnel decompression `` outpatient procedure '' . There two study specifically involved OB/GYN patient ; one investigate buffer lidocaine epidural catheter removal investigate buffered lidocaine Norplant insertion . Since Cochrane Review publish , one gynecologic study investigate buffer lidocaine publish involve cervical loop excision . To date , study investigate efficacy buffer lidocaine procedure vulva . The vulva particularly sensitive region biopsy perform extensive innervation , large blood supply involve pelvic exam associate increased anxiety . As many OBGYNs know , vulva affect variety condition benign malignant . A crucial aspect care woman vulvar complaint conduct biopsy lesion ensure occult malignancy and/or classify diagnosis histology . Use local anesthetic standard care biopsy add pain discomfort already painful procedure . Some source recommend use topical anesthetic prior infiltration lidocaine , particularly pediatric patient . However , technique require topical anesthetic apply 20-60 minute prior biopsy , may feasible busy outpatient practice . Currently , American Board Obstetrics Gynecology suggest 8.4 % sodium bicarbonate add lidocaine minimize discomfort . However , currently standard anesthesia recommendation often do clinical practice . Given obstacle topical anesthetic usage , fact address pain involved lidocaine infiltration lack publish literature use buffer lidocaine vulva , study aim investigate use buffer lidocaine versus non-buffered lidocaine set vulvar biopsy use visual analog scale . Research Question : Does buffer lidocaine decrease pain score visual analogue scale infiltration local anesthesia vulvar biopsy ? METHODOLOGY/ STUDY DESIGN : This study double blind , randomize control trial perform Women 's Primary Care Center The Program In Women 's Oncology Clinics . Patients recruit outlined assign sequential study identification number . They ask complete question Data Collection Form/Survey ( see form title `` Data Collection Form '' ) agree study , sign Informed Consent ( see form title `` Informed Consent '' ) . The Data Collection Form/Survey give patient upon decision perform vulvar biopsy provider . The patient consent approve research personnel . Then , patient undergo vulvar biopsy per clinician protocol . Baseline pain score collect use visual analogue scale . After skin prep , pre-filled , sequentially number , randomize 25 gauge syrinx use inject 3ml either buffer non-buffered lidocaine prepare pharmacy outline . The biopsy proceed per clinical standard . The patient present 100 mm visual analogue scale mark pain level . A total three pain score obtain patient mark pain scale instruct : A baseline pain score prior intervention , pain score time infiltration , pain score completion biopsy . The Data Collection Form/Survey collect patient approve research personnel place secure storage . Data enter secure electronic database statistical analysis . Nursing staff WPCC may present biopsy , involve conduction study . The study population interest patient undergo vulvar biopsy noninfectious lesion . These clinic site choose project give relatively high volume procedure . There number trial take place ongoing Women 's Primary Care Center The Program In Women 's Oncology Office , ample infrastructure resource available . Many patient approach research trial , may willing participate reason . SAMPLE SIZE : The sample size calculation base null hypothesis mean pain score woman treat buffered lidocaine treat non-buffered placebo . The alternative hypothesis ( two-sided ) mean pain score woman treat buffered lidocaine different treat non-buffered lidocaine . Assuming alpha 0.05 , 80 % power , standard deviation 21-30 mm ( base previous study measure pain tenaculum application intracervical block ) , need recruit 64 woman per arm able detect 15 mm mean difference group 100 mm VAS . This difference derive prior study show minimally clinically significant difference acute pain VAS 12 mm , 95 % confidence interval range 9 15 mm . Therefore , plan recruit total 128 patient , 64 patient per arm . CRITERIA FOR SUBJECT SELECTION/RECRUITMENT METHOD : Participants recruit June 2015-June 2016 . All patient Women 's Primary Care Center The Program In Women 's Oncology Clinic undergo vulvar biopsy noninfectious vulvar lesion approach research assistant provider clinic ask participate study . The research assistant/provider review study protocol , risk , benefit , write informed consent form patient ( see form title `` Informed Consent '' ) . If patient wish participate , write informed consent study obtain study personnel prior biopsy . Women racial ethnic group consider inclusion study person shall exclude base race ethnicity . DATA COLLECTION/INTERPRETATION : All data collect prospectively research staff nursing staff ( nursing staff WPCC involve research activity ) . Before biopsy , questionnaire complete patient identify factor may influence pain perceive biopsy well baseline demographic information : age , race/ethnicity , education level , analgesic take day biopsy . The physician performing biopsy indication biopsy also note . The primary outcome interest pain score visual analogue scale lidocaine infiltration . A total three pain score obtain research assistant nurse : A baseline pain score prior intervention , pain score time infiltration , pain score completion biopsy . This measure ask patient mark pain level 100 mm scale predetermine time point . The analysis plan base primary outcome mean pain score lidocaine infiltration measure 0 mm 100 mm VAS . The investigator compare two group : 1 ) buffer lidocaine 2 ) non-buffered lidocaine . If data normally distribute , compare mean pain score two group use t-test . If data deviate notably normality , nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test use comparison . Imbalances handle adjustment covariates multiple linear regression . The investigator use intention treat analysis . After write informed consent obtain subject admit study , participant randomize one two group , buffer lidocaine non-buffered lidocaine . Randomization list computer generate one-to-one allocation ratio block WIH pharmacy staff . After sign consent form , participant assign study ID number correspond order recruitment study . The pharmacy prepare identical syrinx contain 9 ml 1 % lidocaine + 1 ml sodium bicarbonate 10 ml 1 % lidocaine label study name sequentially number . The numbered syringe correspond participant 's study ID number obtain study staff lock refrigerator Women 's Primary Care Center The Program In Women 's Oncology . The syrinx appear identical . Participants , study personnel , medical assistant , clinician blind assignment . FACILITIES : All patient relate aspect study transpire Women 's Primary Care Center The Program In Women 's Oncology . Data processing interpretation take place Women Infants Hospital conjunction Division Research . CONFIDENTIALITY : The patient enrol study ask permission access medical record . To ensure patient confidentiality , form mark participant ID number , key contain identify information keep separately lock cabinet research personnel access . Electronic data store Care New England file server , file server locate physically secure data center . Access Care New England data center card-controlled access server room record . Care New England computer account management policy practice ensure computer access study database limit key study personnel . SAFETY : Study personnel meet review safety issue logistics 25 % , 50 % 75 % recruitment . Adverse event complication record data collection sheet review PI roll basis . PERSONNEL/ADMINISTRATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE : Patients recruit data collect designated research staff and/or provider Women 's Primary Care Center The Program In Women 's Oncology . The biopsy perform designated key research personnel . These provider educate standard protocol utilized Center . Nursing staff WPCC may present biopsy , involve conduction study .</detailed_description>
