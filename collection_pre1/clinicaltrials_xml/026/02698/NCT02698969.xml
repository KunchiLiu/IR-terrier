	<brief_title>Recovery Muscle Function After Deep Neuromuscular Block Means Diaphragm Ultrasonography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study prospective , double-blind , single center randomize study perform 60 patient ASA physical status I-II , 18-80 year old , undergoing dNMB rocuronium ear nose throat ( ENT ) surgery . Randomization perform use table create website www.randomization.com , patient divide equally two group : Treatment Sugammadex ( SUG group ) treatment Neostigmine ( NEO group ) . Exclusion criterion include : A history hepatic renal disease , chron-ic acute alcoholism , allergy hypersensitivity Sugammadex and/or atropine Neostigmine , current medication CNS effect , history neurologic disease , diaphragmatic palsy , pregnancy nursing arrhythmia . Continuous neuromuscular monitoring perform use TOF ratio obtain ad-ductor pollicis muscle . At conclusion surgical procedure , patient receive either Neostigmine ( NEO group ) Sugammadex ( SUG group ) NMB reversal . The physician administer study drug insure per-formed open-label ( non-blinded ) basis . All patient show TOF ratio ≥0.9 extubated . Diaphragmatic function ( assessed ultrasonographic evaluation TF amplitude excursion ) evaluate subject following time point : 1 . Prior induction general anesthesia . 2 . At conclusion surgical procedure TOF ratio 0.9 . 3 . 15 30 minute discharge operate theatre . The physician perform ultrasound scan different one involve administration drug NMB reversal former blind respect treatment receive patient . It likely , despite TOF value great 0.9 , high diaphragm recovery occur earlier last long reversal NMB achieve use Sugammadex ( specific antagonist ) compare Neostigmine ( non-specific reversal ) . In order standardize anesthetic technique , premedication administer patient candidate undergo microlaryngoscopy procedure . Besides individual enrol receive neuromuscular monitoring ulnar nerve stimulation TOF Watch® ( Organon , Oss , Netherlands ) . The device calibrate pre-operatively parameter set use standard train four ( TOF ) methodology administration hypnotic drug prior muscle relaxation . Standard induction general anesthesia perform use intravenous ( iv ) fentanyl ( 2 mcg kg-1 ) , propofol ( 2 mg kg-1 ) , rocuronium ( 0.6 mg kg-1 ) . Tracheal intubation perform patient fails register signal TOF . Rocuronium ( 0.15 mg kg-1 ) re-administered PTC elicit 5 twitch order maintain dNMB . Sevoflurane administer at1.0 MAC air/oxygen mixture . Fentanyl titrate bolus 0.5 mcg kg-1 every 30 minute maintain analgesia . Prior induction anesthesia , ultrasonography diaphragm evaluation perform use ESAOTE ultrasound machine ( ESAOTE MyLab , Genova , Italy ) assess TF amplitude excursion . With spontaneously breathe patient semi-recumbent position , amplitude excursion evaluate follow method Kim et al ( 7 ) use 3.5-MHz ultrasound probe place intercostal space 10th rib right mid-axillary line right diaphragm leave mid-axillary line leave diaphragm . The liver spleen use window hemi-diaphragm . A two-dimensional mode use find best approach select exploration line hemi-diaphragm . With probe fix chest wall respiration , ultrasound beam direct hemi-diaphragmatic dome angle less 70° . During inspiration , normal diaphragm contract move caudally toward transducer ; record upward motion M-mode tracing . The amplitude excursion measure vertical axis trace baseline point maximum height inspiration graph . Three measurement perform patient average side time point protocol ( 7 ) . Moreover , TF assess follow method Vivier et al ( 6 ) linear high frequency probe set 12 Mhz . The diaphragm locate method describe zone apposition assess 0.5-2 cm costophrenic sinus . The inferior border costophrenic sinus identify end-inspiration zone transition artifact representation normal lung ( lung slide ) visualization diaphragm liver . The diaphragm thickness record time motion ( TM ) mode . The diaphragm outline use two clear bright parallel line pleural peritoneal membrane . Measurements average three consecutive breath last valid image record end period ( 6 ) .At conclusion surgical procedure TOF neuromuscular monitoring show minimum 2 twitch , patient randomly receive , describe , either ( NEO Group ) iv Neostigmine 50 µg kg-1 atropine 15 µg kg-1 ( SUG group ) iv Sugammadex 2 mg kg-1 reverse residual curarization . Extubation perform follow criterion meet : Patient awake execute simple command , show regular respiratory pattern tidal volume 6-7 mL/kg refer ideal body weight ( IBW ) TOF ratio ≥0.9 . During period precede TOF ratio &gt; 0.9 , bilateral diaphragm ultrasonography evaluate amplitude excursion TF perform assess muscle recovery spontaneous breathing patient . These measurement compare baseline muscle assessment . Three additional diaphragm ultrasound scan perform 15 30 minute discharge operate theatre . Follow perform document every adverse event complication occur discharge hospital . Data collect use paper CRF page . Data entry perform one central site maintain overall database perform responsible data analysis . The study conduct within 8 month -1 year approval ethical committee . A preliminary report complete submit first six month data collection . Data collect use paper CRF page . Data entry perform one central site maintain overall database perform responsible data analysis . All compile CRFs archive . In order eliminate possible data entry error , individual data compare range plausible value . After data entry , automate check , define beforehand ( priori ) , perform evaluate internal inconsistency , range error , miss data . For atypical/out-of-range/missing data , query automatically send investigator . Once query solve , database lock used statistical analysis.Statistical analysis perform collaboration Department Statistics University Florence . Complete data unblinded external medical statistic review complete . Data collect single statistical analysis perform completion study use intention treat ( ITT ) analysis . With regard primary endpoint , difference two group respect distribution muscle function recovery deep muscular blockade subject non-parametric test depend characteristic outcome distribution . To compare primary endpoint 2 group , data analyse use Wilcoxon rank sum test two independent sample expect continuous normally distribute . As sensitivity analysis , parametric test potentially employ thorough evaluation validity distribution assumption . The ultrasonography TOF data summarize drug treatment group mean , standard deviation , quintiles , minim maximum value . In addition , two-sided 95 % confidence interval calculate comparison two group main descriptive parameter primary secondary variable . In order compare different percentage respiratory event two arm study , chi square test performed . Finally , descriptive statistic variable describe characteristic patient enrol study patient exclude study produce . The mean , median , standard deviation range calculate continuous data drug treatment group . For categorical variable , frequency count percentage calculate . Power/Sample Size : Because first clinical trial proposes evaluate endpoint , publish data available time . However , assume 25 % difference TF group would clinically meaningful , confidence interval 95 % power 80 % , sample size calculation provide StatCalc EPI INFO ver 7.0 ( Center Diseases Control , Atlanta , GA , USA ) consider 28 patient group fundamental reach endpoint predefined . This proposal request fund pilot study , double blind design , participant randomly enrol receive Sugammadex Neostigmine 1:1 allocation use standardize table create website www.randomization.com .</detailed_description>
