	<detailed_description>The TRUE HD Study aim collect real-world data use Rhythmia mapping system IntellaMap Orion map catheter patient indicated ablation procedure use 3D Mapping system . The study collect specific information management ablation procedures commercial system include limited acute procedural success , type proportion arrhythmia mapped/treated , map system use overall . Usage data may use planning future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
