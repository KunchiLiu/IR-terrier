	<brief_summary>The investigator select 30 patient symmetrical impaction third molar , accord Pell Gregory dental impaction classification , would submit two surgical procedure , right left , surgeries dexamethasone 8 mg administer pre-surgery phase , use dexamethasone ( 12 mg/day ) 3 day one side diclofenac sodium ( 150 mg/day ) 3 day side continue , randomize , double-blind cross-over trial patient act control ( split-mouth ) . Other drug use postoperative period , rescue analgesic antibiotic therapy identical patient . The analyzed variable visual analogue pain scale ( VAS ) , total number consume analgesic , swell trismus ( objectively ) , statistically analyzed mean Student 's t-test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Use Dexamethasone Diclofenac Sodium Immediate Post-Operative Care Third Molar Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN Clinical double-blind , randomize , split-mouth trial . This study submit approved Human Research Ethics Committees Hospital Geral de Vila Penteado CAA Protocol : 34824714.8.0000.5446 . MASKING AND RANDOMIZATION To ensure patient , main researcher , surgeon statistician unaware drug would use postoperatively , dexamethasone ( 4 mg ) diclofenac sodium ( 50 mg ) prepare capsule color size , store similar vial cod drug No . 1 drug No . 2 . The drug use different procedure disclose acquisition analysis data . The randomization procedure perform researcher involved evaluation patient surgery , use sequentially number sealed envelope . Each envelope combination drug use postoperative period , protocol 1 ( 1 drug ) protocol 2 ( drug 2 ) side surgery ( right left ) . For enrolled patient , researcher involved patient assessment surgery open envelope , inform main researcher protocol use postoperatively , surgeon side operate . The second surgical procedure perform contralateral side , use another medical protocol postoperatively , interval two month procedure . Thus , patient , surgeon main researcher know medical protocol would use postoperatively . The methodology study seek follow rule new CONSORT 2010 Statement . SURGICAL PROCEDURES AND DRUGS Five minute surgery , patient receive pre-operative drug ( Cefazoline1g/Dexamethasone 8 mg/100 ml 0.9 % saline solution ) intravenously . With patient supine position operate table , surgeon perform extra intra oral antisepsis chlorhexidine 0.2 % anesthesia inferior alveolar , lingual , buccal , posterior superior alveolar great palatine nerve respect protocol describe Malamed , lidocaine 2 % epinephrine 1:100,000 , maximum volume 9 ml . Initially , incision make alveolar crest along mesial distal aspect mandibular branch reach distolingual region second molar , follow intrasulcular incision surround second molar interdental area second first molar . Afterwards , surgeon raise mucoperiosteal flap , perform osteotomy procedure ( high speed engine , spherical surgical drill No . 8 , conical drill 702 , copious irrigation saline solution 0.9 % ) , tooth section crown and/or root ( high speed engine , zecrya surgical drill copious irrigation saline solution 0.9 % ) indicate case , tooth dislocation , dental avulsion , curettage filing copious irrigation cavity saline solution 0.9 % , absorbable polyglactin 910 suture ( Vycril 4.0 - Ethicon Johnson &amp; Johnson Brasil Ltda . - SÃ£o Paulo ) . Then , surgeon make incision make jaw tuberosity along mesial distal aspect order reach distolingual region second molar , follow intrasulcular incision surround second molar interdental area second first molar , raise total mucoperiosteal flap , ostectomy ( chisel gouge ) , tooth luxation , dental avulsion , curettage filing copious irrigation cavity saline solution 0.9 % , absorbable polyglactin 910 wound suture . The duration surgery note minute time completion first anesthesia time final suture . POST-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT After surgery , researcher charge give instruction local hemostatic measure , nutrition , wound cleaning , physical exertion restriction , dosage give drug patient accord research protocol . Protocol 1 : Amoxycillin ( 500mg ) 8/8 hour 7 day , drug 1 8/8 h 3 day rescue drug , case pain , Dipyrone ( 500mg ) could consume within 4 / 4hours . Protocol 2 : Amoxycillin ( 500mg ) 8/8 hour 7 day , drug 2 8/8 h 3 day rescue drug , case pain , Dipyrone ( 500mg ) could consume within 4 / 4hours . CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS For side , elapse time surgical procedure record , start time anesthetic puncture complete end last suture . The pain measure analog scale 0 10 corresponding : 0 = pain , 1 2 = MILD , ( easily tolerate ) , 3 5 = MODERATE ( tolerable discomfort ) , 6 8 = strong ( discomfort difficult tolerate ) 9 10 = VERY STRONG ( unbearable ) , besides pain score annotation pre-set time ( immediate postoperative period , 4 8 hour postoperatively ) . The patient fill control file total number tablet consume within 72 hour record . The swell assess compare value three facial line : ( 1 ) distance lateral corner eye gonial angle operate side ; ( 2 ) distance bottom edge tragus commissure mouth operate side ; ( 3 ) distance low edge tragus soft pogonion operate side ( Figure 1 ) . In three different time , evaluate preoperative value ( time 1 ) postoperative value 2nd day ( time 2 ) 7th day ( time 3 ) surgery , measure third researcher . Trismus assess compare value distance incisal edge upper low central incisor measure millimeter ruler . In three different time , evaluate preoperative value ( time 1 ) postoperative value 2nd day ( time 2 ) 7th day ( time 3 ) surgery .</detailed_description>
