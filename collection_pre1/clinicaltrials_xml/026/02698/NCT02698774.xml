	<detailed_description>Populations risk malaria infection need diagnostic technology reliable sensitive setting without electricity , clean water , highly trained technician . Macha Research Trust Zambia Ministry Health collaborate identify treat low-level asymptomatic malaria infection evaluate elimination strategy . The VZNIGHT research program focus development technology approach facilitate diagnosis evaluation asymptomatic malaria use high sensitivity , point care diagnostic technology . The diagnostic technology development sufficiently mature transition laboratory-synthesized sample primary human specimen collect field necessary advance development . Specific Aim : The investigator evaluate approach use magnetic bead capture , isolation , surface tension valve transfer biomarkers improve sensitivity already approve RDTs detection malaria infection . Results compare obtained use unenhanced capillary blood specimen directly apply approve malaria RDTs ( current standard care ) . The purpose study evaluate experimental approach device design field setting , order improve diagnostic performance RDT . Anonymous , finger-prick blood specimen collect individual consent study advise undergo malaria rapid diagnostic test part standard clinical practice public health surveillance . The result enhance RDT methodology share patient care provider , since yet , unproven . Results rapid diagnostic test approve clinical use international national govern body administer time part typical standard care , share study participant administer clinician representative clinical setting . Individuals test positive malaria infection use standard RDT method receive standard care treatment administer authorize care provider .</detailed_description>
