	<detailed_description>Postoperative cognitive impairment ( delirium cognitive dysfunction ) frequent fear complication elderly ; increase postoperative morbidity mortality , worsen cognitive functional outcome loss independence increase hospitalization length cost . However , etiology postoperative cognitive impairment , although probably multifactorial , remain unclear strongly debate . The investigator hypothesize excessive anesthesia depth associate intraoperative hypotension may play critical role pathogenesis cognitive impairment follow surgery .</detailed_description>
