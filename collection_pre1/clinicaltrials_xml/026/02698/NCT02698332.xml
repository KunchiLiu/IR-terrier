	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING Cluster randomize control single blind study diagnostic aid general practice RECRUITMENT OF GENERAL PRACTICES Recruitment general practice do online advertisement email newsletter general practice , invitation post 200 practice invitation 44 general practice already participate medical audit project regard UTI ( ref til Gloria ) . Only practice Capital Region Denmark could participate . RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Randomization perform use online random number generator employee part investigation team send diagnostic algorithm intervention group . The practice ask reveal allocation investigator case contact . Allocation conceal investigator analysis primary outcome . INTERVENTION AND CONTROLS The practice intervention group receive laminate diagnostic algorithm post get access smart-phone integrated web-page , could calculate post-test probability base pre-test probability accuracy diagnostic test .The diagnostic algorithm consist three part , one urine dipstick , one point-of-care microscopy one urine culture . The practice instruct , use algorithm voluntary . Control practice receive diagnostic algorithm access smart-phone integrate web-page . RECRUITMENT OF PATIENTS The practice tell register diagnostics treatment first 20-40 patient present general practice symptom UTI regardless age , sex comorbidity . For patient , practice send urine sample microbiological department reference . INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Inclusion criterion patient symptom UTI formerly participate study urinalysis perform . The exclusion criterion acute admission hospital . DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT On patient-level , study observational anonymous . The practice register clinical history , diagnostics treatment use case-report form data patient fit one sheet paper . On day one ( day consultation ) , clinical history , diagnostics , diagnosis treatment register . On day two ( day consultation ) , result point-of-care urine culture , perform , subsequent diagnosis treatment register . The result reference urine culture register result report back practice day 4-6 . The intervention group could use algorithm saw fit . REFERENCE CULTURE Urine microbiological department incubate standardized boric-acid container ( Urine-Monovette® , Sarstedt ) collect transport service microbiological department . At microbiological laboratory ( Herlev Hvidovre ) , urine sample analyze Inoqul A™ Bi-plate ( CHROMagar blood agar ) 10 μL half agar . The susceptibility pattern determine Mueller Hinton agars disk contain mecillinam , trimethoprim , nitrofurantoin sulfamethizol . Significant growth define growth ≥103 cfu/mL E. coli S. saprophyticus , ≥104 cfu/mL typical uropathogens ≥105 cfu/ml possible uropathogens accordance European consensus [ 21 ] . Plates significant growth two uropathogens label mixed culture ( inconclusive ) . The result send practice within 4-5 workday electronically practice register result culture susceptibility mecillinam , trimethoprim , nitrofurantoin sulfamethizol case-report . ETHICS AND PATIENT SAFETY The study present ethical committee Copenhagen require ethical approval since study purely observational patient level interfere patient-treatment . Registration patient data do anonymously require approval Danish data protection agency .</detailed_description>
