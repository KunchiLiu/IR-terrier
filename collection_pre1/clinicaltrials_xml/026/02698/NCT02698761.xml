	<brief_title>A Comprehensive Care Plan Pediatric Patients With Vaso-Occlusive Crises</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) disease inherit autosomal recessive trait result several interactive process : polymerization hemoglobin S ( HbS ) , hemolysis , nitric oxide depletion , vaso-occlusion . [ 3 ] The common manifestation sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive pain event , specifically dactylitis typically occur first clinical manifestation . [ 4 ] As patient age , early onset peripheral pain move central region result increased severity vaso-occlusive crisis . [ 4 ] Pain blockage sickeled cell vessels cause poor blood flow localize area . There clinical laboratory finding indicate severity pain associate sickle cell crisis , [ 4 ] make difficult physician identify amount pain patient actually experience . Length stay hospital depends largely physician discretion patient report . Sleep instrumental many aspect physical emotional health childhood adolescence . Sleep disruption pain significant concern patient sickle cell disease due prevalence acute chronic pain . [ 7 ] In study conduct Daniel et al. , sickle cell patient 4-10 year old , likely exhibit disrupt sleep , specifically night-waking sleep-disordered breathing , child diagnose sickle cell disease similar demographic background . [ 7 ] Furthermore , child severe form sickle cell disease report restless sleep child less severe form . [ 7 ] Overall , literature suggest sleep disruption may interfere child 's daily function , along ability cope SCD complication . [ 7 ] Daniel et al . recommend discuss way improve sleep habit child suffer SCD may increase efficacy pain management , priapism , enuresis . [ 7 ] Another study Valrie etal. , suggest poor quality sleep correlate increased occurrence sickle cell disease pain follow day . [ 9 ] They also discover high pain severity relate poor sleep quality relationship exacerbate stressful situation . [ 9 ] Developing suitable sleeping environment ( e.g . remove television , limit light ) maximize sleep efficacy result good health outcome quality life . [ 7 ] There minimal research evaluate relationship exercise sickle cell disease child adolescent . Studies conduct sickle cell disease adult respect effect exercise produce mixed result partly due patient comorbid illness . In 2012 , Chirico et al . compare two fitness level group include , subject partake regular physical activity two year prior study versus subject partake regular , weekly physical activity several year lead study . [ 5 ] Both group contain sickle cell trait carrier subject normal hemoglobin . [ 5 ] Subjects perform incremental maximum exercise test data collect heart rate via chest monitor oxidative stress level via blood sample various point follow completion exercise task . [ 5 ] Results indicate regular physical activity help blunt increase oxidative stress decrease nitric oxide metabolism regulation antioxidant enzyme activity response exercise sickle cell trait carrier . [ 5 ] These finding suggest attenuate sickle cell crisis subject regular exercise compare sedentary group . Presently , Phoenix Children 's Hospital , protocol exists management sleep exercise sickle cell patient . The relevant policy name `` Parenting Visitation '' include guideline regard sleep visiting hour well enforced . In hospital , sickle cell population know long length stay . Between October 2014 September 2015 , 89 admission vaso-occlusive crisis average length stay 6 day 12 admission great 10 day 5 admission great 20 day . Prior research suggest implementation standardize care ( e.g . order set , protocol , flowchart ) improve compliance patient outcomes [ 8 ] , reduce overall length stay , mitigate cost . Therefore , develop new comprehensive care plan ( CPP ) enhance standard care include follow care aspect : 1 . Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) . PCA initiate manage discretion Pain Management team . Naloxone infusion available opioid related side effect . Once tapered , patient transition oral opioids administer need . Patients discharge home , appropriate , oral opioids wean instruction . 2 . Other Medications . All medication give daytime hour , possible . All home medication continue inpatient . Ketorolac give intravenously every 6 hour 12 dos switch ibuprofen mouth every 6 hour discharge home . Stool softener utilized narcotic prevent constipation . A clonidine patch may use adjunct analgesia anxiolysis . A lidocaine patch may use localized pain . 3 . Pain Psychology . Consultations begin Day 2 continue need . The psychologist teach patient sleep hygiene technique , non-pharmacologic pain management skill include : distraction , diaphragmatic breathing , progressive muscle relaxation , guide imagery medical hypnosis . 4 . Physical Therapy . Consultations begin Day 2 continue need . Patient expect spend time bed Day 2 participate light activity . 5 . Sleep Hygiene . Will introduce experimental group . Patient must sleep hour 10 PM 5 AM daily . Window blind open 8 AM . Patient must awake ready participate therapy 9 AM . Napping discretion physician . Practitioners examine care order critically , routine vital sign , determine safe and/or appropriate defer sleep . Room light turn help promote circadian rhythm . No video game , television , cell phone , computer allow time . 6 . Extracurricular . Will participate child life activity recommend ( e.g . Playroom , Zone ) . TV , phone , computer , video game hour 4-9 PM ( computer okay outside hour school work ) . 7 . Other . Patient eat meal regular daytime hour ( e.g . breakfast consume 9 ) shower daily . No overnight visitor allow . We propose evaluate feasibility new CPP pilot randomize control trial determine pain length stay reduce patient sickle cell disease . We also propose evaluate sleep regimen determine reduce hospital stay help pain . We hypothesize increased physical activity proper sleep , implement CPP , correlate decreased hospital length stay decrease pain . Additionally , believe create standardize nighttime environment hospital help child stay circadian rhythm thus promote improve sleep effective inpatient disease management . Specific Aims Primary : To determine feasibility efficacy CPP reduce pain length stay patient sickle cell disease . A.To evaluate patient follow CPP physical activity regimen less pain short hospital stay patient receive standard care . B.To measure patient follow CPP sleep activity regimen less pain short hospital stay patient receive standard care . Study Design This prospective pilot study 20 subject sickle-cell disease admit Phoenix Children 's Hospital acute vaso-occlusive crisis . Patients randomize via random number generator equal probability assignment either CPP ( experimental ) standard care ( control ) trial arm . Eligible subject family approach first day hospital admission consent participate randomization . After randomization , subject give multiple questionnaire evaluate current sleep habit , activity level , psychological construct Procedures During enrollment visit , questionnaire administer every subject evaluate current sleep habit , activity level , pain , quality life . Subjects receive Actiwatch Spectrum Pro give instruction use . Control Group : Patient receive standard care . Nursing staff aware study presence receive specific instruction patient . Experimental Group : During enrollment visit , patient go new comprehensive care protocol study staff sign agreement state compliance . Patient give copy comprehensive care plan reference . Nursing staff aware study 's presence help support patient 's compliance sleep procedure accord care plan . Discharge Study staff closely follow patient 's progress hospital . Once patient ready discharge , visit study investigator give one final PedsQLâ„¢ complete . An additional questionnaire give experimental group ask opinion CPP . The Actiwatch Spectrum Pro collect patient properly disinfect . Measurement/Assessments Actiwatch Spectrum Pro Monitoring Device The Actiwatch Spectrum Pro activity device continuously monitor activity ( active minute ) , sleep ( minute sleep quality ) allow subject input numerical pain fatigue rating . At end patient 's trial , data extract actiwatch place patient 's alphanumeric account monitor research personnel . Patients family access account . We examine minute activity per day minute sleep per day compare pain score record look data extract Actiwatch Spectrum Pro . Analysis Baseline characteristic summarize within two care group use descriptive statistic include count percent categorical variable mean standard deviation ( median interquartile range ) continuous variable . Evaluation CPP length stay do use T-test Kruskal-Wallis test , depend length stay distribution . Analysis variance repeat measure ass effect time pain score within care group . Differences mean cumulative pain score care group also examine daily hospital stay . Additional analysis investigate association care component , physical activity sleep , length stay pain score use appropriate statistical method describe . All statistical test significance level 0.05 .</detailed_description>
