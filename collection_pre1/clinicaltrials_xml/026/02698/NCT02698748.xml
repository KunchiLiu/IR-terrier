	<brief_summary>One propose idea malaria elimination include use drug interrupt malaria transmission exhaust human reservoir infection . Theoretically , mass treatment entire population effective rapid-acting drug ( instance ACT ) , follow administration effective prophylactic regime minimum four week , outlast typical development period Plasmodium parasites Anopheline mosquito , could achieve objective . In respect , chloroquine ( CQ ) would appropriate candidate . This drug exhibit two condition make attractive elimination campaign : 1 ) It demonstrate excellent safety profile , allow use age group include pregnant woman child ; 2 ) Its relatively long elimination half life ( t1/2=1-2 month ) provide long post-treatment prophylactic effect . Recent evidence suggest CQ sensitivity may return place discontinuation reduce drug pressure parasite population . In country Malawi , P. falciparum seem regain full sensitivity CQ , molecular marker antiCQ resistance nearly disappear . While support reintroduction CQ first line therapy , suggest , proven sensitive give area , could play prophylactic role malaria elimination strategy use combination drug tool . Thus , intend evaluate potential role chloroquine prevent infection elimination campaign perform randomize , single-blind , placebo-controlled trial asymptomatic Mozambican adult . Choosing asymptomatic parasitaemic adult male malaria-endemic area study population introduces limit risk administer drug uncertain efficacy ( 47 % efficacious 2001-2002 ) . In malaria-endemic area , age group remarkably low risk develop severe disease ( irrespective clinical symptom ) , foreseeable parasitemia may well tolerate , certain case , spontaneously clear individual 's blood result immune system . In unlikely event clinical symptomatology appear throughout follow-up , individual examine study clinician treat immediately country 's first-line malaria treatment ( artemether-lumefantrine , Coartem ® ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This surveillance study two-arm prospective evaluation parasitological response directly observe treatment CQ ( vs. placebo ) clearing asymptomatic parasitemia . People asymptomatic P. falciparum parasitaemia , define presence P. falciparum infection absence clinical symptomatology include fever , history fever precede 24 hour , malaise , fatigue , chill , symptom may derive malarial infection , meet study inclusion criterion enrol , treat site CQ phosphate ( 25mg/Kg CQ base divide three daily dos : 10mg/kg day 1 ( usually 4 tablet ) ; 10mg/kg day 2 ( 4 tablet ) 5mg/kg day 3 ( 2 tablet ) ) placebo pill ( schedule , 4 tablet day one two ; 2 tablet day three ) , monitor 28 day . The follow-up consist fix schedule check-up visit correspond clinical laboratory examination . On basis result assessment , patient classify therapeutic failure ( early late ) adequate response . The proportion patient experience therapeutic failure follow-up period use estimate efficacy study drug . PCR analysis use distinguish true recrudescence due treatment failure episodes reinfection .</detailed_description>
