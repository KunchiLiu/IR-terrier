	<brief_title>Neurorehabilitation After Traumatic Brain Injury : Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment follow moderate severe traumatic brain injury usual . To date , cognitive rehabilitation effect cerebral plasticity quality life remain unproven essentially methodological bias . Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation innovative technique noninvasive brain stimulation show efficacy literature . The current study want good understand cerebral plasticity mechanism optimize non-pharmacological rehabilitation approach patient traumatic brain injury . The aim present study assess effect rehabilitation combine Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation provide traumatic brain injury patient cognitive impairment cerebral plasticity use functional magnetic resonance imaging . Effects rehabilitation Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation observe functional magnetic resonance image activation map acquire . Relationship attentional outcome measure neuropsychological assessment activation extend explore .</detailed_description>
