	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct randomize trial ( 20000 test intervention arm ) compare performance tomosynthesis plus 2D Digital Mammography v usual care ( 2D digital mammography ) respect incidence advance cancer ( interval follow round ) interval cancer . The investigator also measure detection rate , specificity , interval cancer , advance cancer occur interval cancer subsequent screen allow estimate overdiagnosis . In Reggio Emilia population-based screen program active . It invite woman 45 74 year old 2D digital mammography ( 2 projection , double reading ) every 2 year ( annually 45 49 ) .
