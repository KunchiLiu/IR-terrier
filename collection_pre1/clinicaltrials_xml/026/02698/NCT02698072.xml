	<brief_title>Improvement Pain Function Following Physiotherapy Program Older Adults With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapeutic exercise dry needling relieve pain improve function , different treatment tool . Therapeutic exercise take multitude form result numerous systemic local effect , investigate among people knee osteoarthritis . Therapeutic exercise cover range targeted physical activity directly aim improve muscle strength , neuromotor control , joint range motion aerobic fitness . One main aim therapeutic approach improve muscle strength , give weakness common knee osteoarthritis . Enhanced strength low limb may lessen internal knee force , reduce pain improve physical function . Primary knee osteoarthritis provokes pain disfunction thought mediate joint damage change joint homeostasis . Recently , investigation focus impaired neuromuscular system contribution mention symptom knee osteoarthritis syndrome explore use dry needling . Dry needle therapeutic approach decrease pain improve function high recommend evidence ( grade A ) effectiveness upper-quarter myofascial pain , poorly understood knee osteoarthritis patient .</detailed_description>
