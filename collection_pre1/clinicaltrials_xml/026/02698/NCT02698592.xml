	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Thermocool SF ® system least effective safe regular 8mm catheter irrigate tip catheter treatment cavo-tricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Thermocool SF Catheter Common Cavo-tricuspid Isthmus Dependent Atrial Flutter Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The catheter Biosense Webster Thermocool SF® characterize porous , thin-walled tip allow uniform cooling catheter tip , achieve increase efficiency cool . This allow reduce flow irrigation power output achieve similar tissue temperature conventional irrigated catheter . There evidence great efficiency Thermocool SF® catheter cause tissue damage , clinical study specific treatment common atrial flutter . Investigators hypothesize Thermocool SF® system least effective safe treatment cavo-tricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter conventional 8 mm irrigate tip catheter . 150 patient common atrial flutter randomize 3 group 50 patient group underwent ablation catheter ablation CelsiusTMDS® 8 mm , 3.5 mm irrigate tip Thermocool® Thermocool® SF respectively . After procedure , patient follow clinical review , electrocardiograms 3rd , 6th 12th month , 24h ECG-Holter examination first 6th month monthly phone consultation . Rate recurrence presence supraventricular arrhythmia record follow-up .</detailed_description>
