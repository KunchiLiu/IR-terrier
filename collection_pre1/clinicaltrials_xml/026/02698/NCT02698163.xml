Currently , standard care treatment RCT utilize gutta-percha root canal filling material . Our research group previously demonstrate NDGP 's improvement tensile strength compare gutta-percha . This research study new type filler , gutta-percha modify addition nanodiamond material ( NDGP ) . This equivalence study NDGP standard gutta-percha administration .</brief_summary>
