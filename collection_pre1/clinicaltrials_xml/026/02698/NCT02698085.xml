	<brief_summary>Diacutaneous Fibrolysis manual method treatment , address mechanical pain neuromusculoskeletal system . In clinical practice favorable effect observe patient carpal tunnel syndrome , publish study evaluate result os technique . The objective trial evaluate Diacutaneous Fibrolysis effective symptom , function , grip , mechanosensitivity neural conduction velocity compare placebo . For purpose investigator conduct randomize controlled trial double-blind ( patient examiner ) . The investigator include patient diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome ( low moderate intensity ) neurophysiological test . Patients include randomized 2 group one receive Diacutaneous Fibrolysis placebo . Both group receive 5 treatment session . The variable measure begin end treatment . And also variable measure session . Patients participate placebo group , intervention finish investigator give opportunity receive actual technique</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator select patient diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome electroneurogram , meet inclusion criterion offer take part study . When patient agree participate sign informed consent , investigator collect dependent variable consider ( symptom , mechanosensitivity , functional capacity upper limb , tractor speed neural conduction ... ) patient assign intervention group : real placebo . Each patient receive treatment 5 session trascurriendo intersessional 2- 5 day . After 5 session investigator remeasured variable . In addition , month later remeasured symptom functional capacity upper limb . Finally , show technique receive . If patient receive technical placebo he/she give opportunity receive 5 session actual technique .</detailed_description>
