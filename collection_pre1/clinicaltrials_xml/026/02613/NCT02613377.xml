	<brief_summary>Transfusions cause adverse event child adult . Patients pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) particularly expose transfusion plasma-rich blood product ( red blood cell ( RBC ) , plasma platelet ) risk adverse event transfusion particularly high vulnerable population . Transfusion-related acute lung injury ( TRALI ) , acute inflammation lung impair gas exchange lead acute respiratory failure , one 2 deadly transfusion complication general population . There limited evidence TRALI incidence impact critically ill child . This reduce awareness PICU team complication , make decision process transfuse particularly difficult . Moreover , acute lung injury highly prevalent critically ill child . It therefore complex ascertain high frequency respiratory deterioration observe transfusion PICU explain transfusion evolution patient 's critical illness . The investigator conduct cohort study consecutive transfuse critically ill child , control group match non-transfused child . The primary objective determine transfusion RBC , plasma and/or platelet PICU independent risk factor TRALI , compare respiratory evolution two match ( transfused non-transfused ) group . The secondary objective include determination incidence rate , risk factor clinical impact TRALI transfuse PICU patient . The investigator study `` classic TRALI '' `` delay TRALI '' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transfusion-related Acute Lung Injury : Prospective Cohort Study Critically Ill Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This prospective cohort study include consecutive transfused patient admit participate PICUs one-year period control group match non-transfused patient . The primary objective assess use complete cohort transfuse non-transfused patient . Secondary objective study transfused patient . Outcomes The primary outcome measure TRALI ( definite , probable , delayed TRALI ) define section . In non-transfused patient , definition Acute Lung Injury one use criterion define TRALI , observation period similar 72-h period , start time zero . Primary Objectives - Objective # 1a : determine transfusion RBC , plasma platelet independent risk factor TRALI critically ill child . - Objective # 1b : compare progression respiratory function , particular SpO2/FiO2 ratio , transfuse non-transfused PICU patient . Secondary Objectives - Objective # 2.a : To determine incidence rate classic ( definite probable ) TRALI delay TRALI transfuse PICU patient . - Objective # 2.b : To characterize risk factor classic ( definite probable ) TRALI delay TRALI transfuse PICU patient . - Objective # 2.c : To compare progression respiratory parameter 1st transfusion PICU patient classic TRALI , delay TRALI , without TRALI . - Objective # 2.d : To compare outcome transfused PICU patient without classic ( definite probable ) TRALI delay TRALI . - Objective # 2.e : To describe inflammatory profile PICU patient definite , probable , delayed TRALI .</detailed_description>
