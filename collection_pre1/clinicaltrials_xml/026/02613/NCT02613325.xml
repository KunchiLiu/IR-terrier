	<brief_summary>The investigator propose use functional photoacoustic microscopy ( fPAM ) evaluate benign malignant pigment lesion tumor depth . Through fPAM analysis follow histological examination , investigator anticipate able non-invasively determine tumor depth pigment lesion ( mole melanoma ) . In melanoma , tumor depth ( Breslow 's depth ) important prognostic indicator , also direct surgical treatment . The ultimate goal develop sensitive clinical tool allow non-surgical evaluation pigment lesion , eventually , aid melanoma diagnosis management - potentially earlier definitive surgical management . In addition , investigator propose use combination fPAM single-cell PAM respectively image CTCs trunk vessel cuticle capillary . Based investigator ' murine model , investigator anticipate able differentiate CTCs blood cell reliably calculate CTC concentration non-invasive manner . CTC concentration demonstrate valuable indicator melanoma 's metastatic potential potential tool evaluate treatment efficacy . The ultimate goal develop sensitive imaging device allow accurate evaluation risk melanoma recurrence metastasis , may facilitate treatment monitoring .</brief_summary>
