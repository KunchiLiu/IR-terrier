	<detailed_description>Lyme tick-borne disease pose significant health threat outdoor worker . In double-blind randomized control trial ( RCT ) North Carolina outdoor worker , investigator previously show long-lasting permethrin-impregnated ( LLPI ) clothing provide &gt; 80 % protection one year Lone Star tick bite among outdoor worker North Carolina . But three issue need addressed finding translated policy : 1 ) Do LLPI clothing protect black legged tick , vector Lyme disease , babesiosis anaplasmosis ? 2 ) What level permethrin metabolite absorb , potentially toxic ? 3 ) Why LLPI clothing previous study lose efficacy year ? Participants : The investigator recruit 250 outdoor worker . The investigator anticipate recruit 80 , 80 , 40,30 , 20 participant NationalGrid , RI Department Environmental Management , Massachusetts Department Conservation &amp; Recreation , National Park Service , US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service . Procedures ( method ) : This randomize controlled trial . All study subject fill weekly tick log , collect attach tick later speciation pathogen detection , submit annual serum sample test exposure tick-borne pathogen . A randomly select subset 60 subject also ask submit urine sample permethrin metabolite analysis several time point follow-up . An additional randomly select subset ( n=30 ) ask submit worn item clothe tick knockdown test permethrin content analysis end first second year field test . The result study could help protect hundred thousand outdoor worker exposure tick tick-borne pathogen .</detailed_description>
