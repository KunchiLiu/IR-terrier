	<brief_title>Mailed FIT Outreach Improve Colon Cancer Screening Safety-net System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Since uptake colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen suboptimal SF safety-net system access care may limit , novel model health care delivery warrant . The overall hypothesis centralize panel management model mail fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) effective increase uptake CRC screening could develop sustain within typical parameter cost-effectiveness budget impact analyse . Barriers immunization adult include missed opportunity visit , limited access provider , provider patient belief efficacy . Design : To rigorously examine benefit centralize panel management improve uptake CRC screening mail FIT , electronic health system use identify eligible patient up-to-date CRC screening . Broadly , patient randomize 1:1 usual care intervention arm , stratify clinic , gender , prior screen , race receive mail FIT kit + usual care versus usual care alone . The cost-effectiveness screening , usual care , centralize management mail FIT outreach compare use mathematical simulation model .</detailed_description>
