	<brief_summary>80 patient mild-moderate traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) sustain 3 month 2 year ago prolong postconcussive symptom recruit . On Day 1 study undergo neuropsychological ( NP ) test . They undergo 10 day Left dorsolateral prefrontal ( DLPFC ) anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( TDCS ) ( 40 active , 40 sham ) combine cognitive training . On day 10 NP testing obtain . On Day 30 , NP test repeat 3rd time . At 6 month 1 year , quality life , depression , post concussive symptom assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our long-term goal develop safe effective treatment symptom mild moderate TBI ( mmTBI ) restore patient high level function , decrease disability , promote brain healing . The objective application investigate use transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) treat symptom executive dysfunction depression patient mmTBI . Our central hypothesis ( 1 ) tDCS pair relevant cognitive training facilitates improve executive function National Institutes Health ( NIH ) -approved neuropsychological measure , ( 2 ) tDCS reduces depression score NIH Common Data Elements TBI , ( 3 ) improvement emotion cognition detectable one year stimulation , ( 4 ) certain clinical variable reliably predict response tDCS . These objective formulate base clinical experience Dr. Ronald Yeo ( project mentor ) characterize symptomatic patient mmTBI post-acute set groundbreaking research lead Dr. Vincent Clark ( project mentor ) demonstrate robust increase attention learn tDCS . Specific Aim 1 : tDCS executive dysfunction mmTBI Experiments aim test hypothesis patient mmTBI , leave prefrontal anodal tDCS concurrent cognitive training ten consecutive weekday result significantly improvement executive function compare sham stimulation . Patients cognitive complaint 3 month 2 year mmTBI recruit local emergency department brain injury clinic . Aim 1.1 : tDCS pair computer-based cognitive training task response inhibition , set shifting , work memory , executive function measure NIH Examiner battery , immediately , one month stimulation . Aim 1.2 : Persistence post-traumatic symptom reduction quality life improvement assess Common Data Elements instrument via telephone interview 6 month one year . Aim 1.3 : Clinical predictor tDCS response include injury severity , premorbid intelligence , post-traumatic symptom burden determine linear mixed-models analysis . Specific Aim 2 : tDCS depressive symptom mmTBI Experiments aim test hypothesis leave prefrontal anodal tDCS patient mmTBI significantly reduce depressive symptom compare sham stimulation . Aim 2.1 : Patients assess symptoms depression via self-report instrument clinician-administered scale NIH Common Data Elements , immediately , one month stimulation protocol . Aim 2.2 : Persistence antidepressant benefit assess via telephone interview 6 month one year . Aim 2.3 : clinical predictor tDCS response injury severity , premorbid intelligence , symptom burden determine .</detailed_description>
