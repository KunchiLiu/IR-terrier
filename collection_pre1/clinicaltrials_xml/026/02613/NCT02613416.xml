	<brief_summary>This non-randomized phase II trial denosumab 120 mg subcutaneous injection monthly pre- post-menopausal woman diagnose stage 0-III breast cancer currently receive anticancer treatment hormonal therapy , chemotherapy , radiation . All patient undergo quantification breast density MRI baseline 1 , baseline 2 ( 3-month observation period ) 3 6 month denosumab , mean 0 , 3 , 6 9 month enter study . Because therapeutic agent injectable drug , investigator conduct single arm study pre- post-treatment measurement determine extent variability breast density time placebo treatment period group utilize . This investigator initiate trial Amgen ( SPONSOR ) provide trial drug denosumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According result several study footnote protocol , convince evidence extensive area radiographically-dense tissue breast independent risk factor development breast cancer . Here , investigator postulate RANK ligand mediate association breast density risk breast cancer progesterone one several factor influence availability RANK ligand mammary tissue promote sustain high breast density . As , investigator hypothesize inhibition RANK ligand anti-RANK ligand antibody therapeutic agent denosumab decrease breast density ; risk factor breast cancer development . The investigator test primary hypothesis RANK ligand inhibition denosumab ( Xgeva ) give 120mg monthly pre- post-menopausal breast cancer patient significantly decrease breast density 6 month . Breast density assess magnetic resonance fat water imaging ( MR-FW ) breast . To control variability endpoint , subject undergo observational period 3 month ( denosumab ) , end measure change breast density MRI baseline 1 baseline 2 ( end 3 month observation period ) . The change breast density baseline MRI first follow-up MRI 3 month study intervention provide baseline breast density measurement determine change breast density woman intervention 6 month . All patient receive 6 month 120 mg denosumab subcutaneously every month repeat MR image obtain measurement 3 6 month denosumab . All participant ask provide optional core needle breast biopsy sample baseline 6 month denosumab .</detailed_description>
