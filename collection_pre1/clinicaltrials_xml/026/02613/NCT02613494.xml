	<brief_title>Clozapine-induced Hypersalivation - Feasibility Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective To assess feasibility recruit community in-patients different centre . Specifically , feasibility study : 1 . Ascertain whether study design acceptable participant , include randomisation use telephone interview . 2 . Ascertain whether intervention acceptable participant indicate likely attrition rate tolerability . Secondary objective Ascertain standard deviation daytime hypersalivation measure estimate require sample size future efficacy randomise clinical trial ( RCT ) . Study design This multicentre ( 3 site ) randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled feasibility study glycopyrrolate hyoscine patient clozapine-induced hypersalivation . Investigators recruit 42 patient prescribed clozapine experience hypersalivation . Eligible participant recruit 5-week study consist 1-week wash-out period follow 4-week treatment period . Participants randomise 1:1:1 basis one three study arm ( hyoscine , glycopyrrolate placebo ) . Self-report measure salivation side effect take weekly cognition assess two occasion study . Identification , recruitment consent participant Participants recruit out-patient clozapine clinic three National Health Service ( NHS ) mental health trust . R &amp; D approval obtain mental health trust prior start study . The study protocol information sheet provide clinical staff participate site ask identify potential participant fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion . Clinical staff approach potential patient seek agreement research staff approach participation study . After permission obtain approach potential participant , researcher write send study information . At least three day later , researcher contact patient telephone enquire interested participation . If patient provisionally agree , appointment make researcher visit participant ( either participant 's home next clinic appointment ) , order answer question participant may obtain write informed consent . Following recruitment consent , Responsible Clinician ( RC ) participant 's General Practitioner ( GP ) inform write ( participant 's consent ) . Randomisation blind Randomisation three trial arm 1:1:1 basis . The three arm : - Hyoscine ( Arm A - treatment ) - Glycopyrrolate ( Arm B - treatment ) - Placebo ( Arm C - control ) Neither participant researcher aware arm participant allocate detail allocation remain concealed research team data lock . Blinding participant research team allocation status assure identical capsule appearance identical label trial medication ( apart label identify patient ) . In event patient develop side- effect drug unblinding require , treat physician make aware study drug , possible side-effects make appropriate decision whether continue discontinue drug . The safety wellbeing patient paramount time . Participant withdrawal replacement Participants remove study due adverse event treat follow accord accept medical practice . The research team may withdraw participant trial : - Adverse event serious adverse event - Withdrawal consent - Persistent non-compliance study protocol - Sponsor 's decision terminate study - Withdrawal Investigator clinical reason relate study drug - Pregnancy - Symptomatic deterioration include patient experience rapid deterioration completion protocol treatment . If patient withdraws withdrawn study , intention replace . Study drug dosage Hyoscine . The dosing schedule Hyoscine Hydrobromide 5-week study period : week 1 - washout period ( discontinue exist medication clozapine-induced hypersalivation ( CIH ) , ) ; week 2 - 300 microgram twice daily ; week 3 , 4 5 - 300 microgram three time daily . This within dose range recommend British National Formulary ( BNF ) ( licence use hypersalivation ) , Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines treatment CIH consistent current prescribing practice . Glycopyrrolate . The dosing schedule Glycopyrronium Bromide 5-week study period : week 1 - washout period ( discontinue exist medication CIH , ) ; week 2 - 1 milligram twice daily ; week 3 , 4 5 - 1 milligram three time daily . Assessment measure Drooling Rating Scale ( DRS ) The DRS two-item scale comprise drool severity frequency assessment combine form score range 2 - 9 . Whilst validate metric ( standard deviation , mean , sensitivity change ) unknown CIH population , good face validity use publish research paediatric hypersalivation . A feasibility aim establish metric CIH population . Nocturnal Hypersalivation Rating Scale ( NHRS ) The NHRS validate single-item 5-point self-report scale measure degree nocturnal salivation respondent experience . The NHRS scale specifically mention Cochrane review treatment CIH recommend inclusion future study efficacy CIH intervention . Brief Assessment Cognition Schizophrenia ( BACS ) The BACS comprise short battery test devise easy administration score assess extent cognitive impairment schizophrenia . The battery include brief assessment executive function , verbal fluency , attention , verbal memory , work memory motor speed require approximately 30 minute complete . Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side-Effect Rating Scale ( LUNSERS ) LUNSERS 51-item checklist side-effects asks rating 5-point scale degree respondent experience side effect last month . It show good reliability validity , correlate well clinician-administered side effect scale . A modified LUNSERS use assess side-effects previous week ( rather month ) . Data collection procedure There three visit total researcher may also one visit conduct exit interview participant consent . The schedule assessment detail Table 1 . A Baseline Visit take place end Week 1 washout period , researcher visit participant home deliver trial medication Week 2 administer assessment measure ( DRS , NHRS , BACS , LUNSERS ) . The Maintenance Visit take place end Week 2 , researcher visit participant home deliver trial medication Weeks 3-5 administer hypersalivation scale ( DRS , NHRS ) side effect scale ( LUNSERS ) . The Final Visit take place end Week 5 researcher visit participant home administer assessment measure ( DRS , NHRS , BACS , LUNSERS ) . An important aim explore feasibility collect information hypersalivation side-effects use weekly telephone call assess . At end Week 3 Week 4 , researcher telephone participant prearrange time administer hypersalivation scale ( DRS , NHRS ) side effect scale ( LUNSERS ) . Researchers request exit interview participant drop study number participant complete study 12 interview ( 4 study arm ) conduct . Interviews take place participant 's home convenience Two researcher ( one also service user ) conduct 20-minute interview explore participant 's experience take part study , explore acceptability study method seek advice study participation experience could improve . Sample size consideration The intended sample size base recruit sufficient number fulfil feasibility aim study . The intention recruit 14 patient three study arm recruitment total sample 42 allow good estimate recruitment attrition rate . The investigator estimate attrition rate 20 % ( substantially high previous study ) implies nine dropout allow clear differentiation progression criterion ( 40 % drop-out , n=17 ) , &gt; 80 % power detect difference size alpha 0.25 ( 1 tail ) . This consistent relaxed power alpha criterion suitable early phase study type specifically alpha 0.25 criterion . Furthermore , 14 arm sufficient gain indication metric ( standard deviation , mean , sensitivity change ) putative primary outcome measure ( DRS ) placebo active treatment arm recruit population future definitive study . Safety Reporting procedures All Adverse Events ( AE ) suspect causal relationship either study drug capture participant 's clinical note Case Report Form ( CRF ) start treatment ( week 2 ) end patient 's involvement study . Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) also report within 24 hour observe learning event . The study manager liaise Chief Investigator ( CI ) evaluate event seriousness , causality expectedness . All SAEs followed-up resolution participate site must provide follow-up report SAE resolve time initial report submit . Trial management quality assurance The study manage Trial Management Group ( TMG ) include individual responsible day-to-day management study . The TMG operational responsibility conduct study include monitor overall progress take appropriate action safeguard participant quality study . The TMG meet least quarterly study actively recruit . At least annually , TMG extend invite independent chair ( involve directly study ) additional independent member , service user representative , assembly conduct Trial Steering Committee ( TSC ) meeting . The TSC take responsibility scientific integrity study , scientific validity study protocol , assessment study quality conduct well scientific quality final study report . Decisions continuation termination study substantial amendment protocol responsibility TSC .</detailed_description>
