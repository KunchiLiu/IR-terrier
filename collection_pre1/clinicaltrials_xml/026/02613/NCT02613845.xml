There various preoperative risk factor influence development PD . Broad research do topic show advanced age , cognitive impairment , depression psychopathologic symptom , intake psychotropic substance , sensory impairment like decrease visual auditory perception , impairment daily life activity , dehydration , malnutrition , metabolic dysfunction , urinary catheter , severity disease different comorbidities , chronic cardiac insufficiency , atrial fibrillation , previous history stroke infection may favor occurrence PD . The incidence PD among high cardiac surgery . The study design assess predictor PD cardiac surgery . Study hypothesis patient variable , score biomarkers predictive incidence PD also severity delirium-associated symptom duration PD cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
