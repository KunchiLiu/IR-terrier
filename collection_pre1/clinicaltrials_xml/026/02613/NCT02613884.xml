	<brief_summary>Children Cystic Fibrosis , age great equal 36 month age less equal 18 year age , 25OHD level less 30 ng/dL ask participate study . Upon consent , give oral cholecalciferol supplementation 250,000 IU next CF clinic visit . The safety assess measure serum calcium level within 1 week supplementation . Efficacy assess use repeat 25OHD level throughout course 12 month .

	<brief_title>Safety , Efficacy , Feasibility High-dose Cholecalciferol Pediatric Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children adult Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) risk develop vitamin D deficiency insufficiency , define 2,25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ) serum blood level &lt; 30 ng/dL . Greater 85 % people CF pancreatic insufficiency , contribute poor absorption fat soluble vitamin addition dietary fat . A 25OHD level great 30 ng/dL describe provide potential improvement marker inflammation adult CF know improve bone mineral density prevent bone fracture population , include CF . This study assess safety one-time high dose cholecalciferol vitamin D3 along efficacy feasibility . Children age 3 year 18 year ( inclusive ) , 25OHD level &lt; 30 ng/dL provide vitamin D3 supplement 250,000 international unit ( IU ) observe CF clinic . We hypothesize one-time , oral , high dose vitamin D3 safely effectively raise 25OHD level 30 ng/dL . Safety monitor serum calcium level 1 week follow dosage , since 25OHD half-life 2-3 week serum calcium level measurement time-point would near middle range . Feasibility measure use 5-question phone survey 1 week follow dosage ( see appendix A - attach ) . Efficacy measure 25OHD level ; 25OHD level find 30-100 ng/dL course study , dose demonstrated effective achieve study 's goal . The purpose study show 25OHD level safely correct one-time dose vitamin D3 safely feasibly provide outpatient set child CF .</detailed_description>
