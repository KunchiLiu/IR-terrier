	<brief_title>Advanced MR Imaging Predictor Treatment Response Newly Diagnosed Glioblastomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard care patient glioblastoma concomitant chemoradiation adjuvant temozolomide . Allowing assessment tumor therapy prior treatment completion important select patient likely benefit alternative treatment option . Multimodal advance MR imaging- contrast-enhanced T1 weight imaging , diffusion-weighted imaging , chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging , perfusion image 3T enables quantitative assessment treatment response . Quantifying change advance MR image technique would allow predict outcome early long-term treatment response survival glioblastoma .</detailed_description>
