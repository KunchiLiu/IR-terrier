	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose Combination Ruxolitinib Bortezomib Patients With Relapsed Refractory Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment relapse refractory Hodgkin Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma remain difficult . To improve upon current efficacy rate new treatment modality need . Currently modality base upon target specific pathway molecular receptor make great impact outcomes refractory patient . The JAK-Stat pathway NF-κB two target show fuel malignant transformation growth myeloma lymphoma . Blockade key point molecular pathway potential halt pro-survival machinery . Combined inhibition JAK/Stat NF-κB may lead synergistic effect well possibly mitigate mechanism resistance either agent . In proposal , investigator aim utilize JAK/Stat inhibitor ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ) proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( Velcade ) target two major pathway malignant transformation hematologic malignancy . The primary objective research study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ) combination standard dose Bortezomib ( Velcade ) patient relapse refractory Hodgkin ( HL ) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) . The University Michigan enroll 24 subject . Eligible subject histologically cytologically confirm Hodgkin Non-hodgkin 's Lymphoma exclude Burkitt , CLL lymphoblastic lymphoma consider relapsed refractory primary chemotherapy . Any prior exposure Jakafi exclude .</detailed_description>

No previous anticancer therapy least 21 day recover treatment related toxicity Prior radiation allow prior study start ( 1st dose study medication ) least 21 day elapse since prior largefield radiation therapy treatment relate toxicity resolve . At least 3 month must pass since radioimmunotherapy . Prior auto graft allow prior study start ( 1st dose study medication ) , patient must least 3 month date stem cell infusion recover ≤ grade 1 toxicity related procedure . Prior allogeneic transplant allow prior study start ( 1st dose study medication ) , patient must least 6 month date stem cell infusion , evidence GVHD , immunosuppressant medication , recover ≤ grade 1 toxicity related procedure . Age &gt; 18 year ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) Performance status ≤2 Life expectancy without treatment &gt; 12 week Patients must adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,200/μl , Platelets ≥75,000/μl , ( 50,000/ μl due BM involvement ) , Direct bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl , unless due Gilbert 's secondary hemolysis , AST ( Aspartate Aminotransferase ) and/or ALT ( Alanine Transaminase ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal unless due lymphomatous involvement liver , Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl and/or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min use CockcroftGault formula symptom attributable grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Subjects must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients currently receive experimental agent , patient must stop experimental agent least 21 day prior 1st study dose . Any prior exposure Jakafi Patients untreated brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Jakafi Velcade . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude study Jakafi inhibitor Jak1 Jak2 kinases potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown , potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Jakafi , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Jakafi . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction Jakafi . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrow suppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy exclude . Patients CLL ( Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ) , Burkitt lymphoblastic lymphoma exclude . Patients would require concurrently take ruxolitinib conjunction strong CYP3A4 inhibitor platelet count le 100,000 ineligible study . Patient require take strong CYP3A4 inducer exclude study .</criteria>
