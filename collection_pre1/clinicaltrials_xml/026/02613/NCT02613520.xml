	<detailed_description>This single center trial ass safety , tolerability immunogenicity PfSPZ Vaccine administer direct venous inoculation ( DVI ) healthy Tanzanian adult , adolescent , child infant . Ninety-nine healthy male female ; adult , adolescent , child infant volunteer , age 6 month 45 year , live Bagamoyo Township enrol base pre-defined inclusion exclusion criterion implement accord international ethical standard . The safety tolerability PfSPZ Vaccine administer three dos either 9.0x10^5 PfSPZ 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ healthy Tanzanian adult , adolescent , child 6 year age older ; three dose 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ 9.0x10^5 PfSPZ healthy Tanzanian child 1 5 year age infants 6 11 month age , case compare NS control , evaluate . In addition , exploratory objective , control human malaria infection ( CHMI ) use assess efficacy adult three week follow immunization . Study Design : This single center trial ten group ( Groups 1a/b : age 18-45 ; Group 2a/b : age 11-17 ; Group 3a/b : age 6-10 ; Group 4a/b : age 1-5 ; Group 5b/c : age 6months-11 month ) 6 subject receive PfSPZ Vaccine 3 subject receive NS eleventh small group ( Group 5a : age 6months-11months ) 3 subject receive PfSPZ Vaccine ; two group contain adult volunteer ( Group 1a/b ) additional 3 infectivity control vaccination phase study . The adult volunteer undergo CHMI 3 week last immunization . For first immunization , two volunteer ( six ) Group 1a receive 9x10^5 PfSPZ Vaccine DVI sentinel , demonstrate safety tolerability . At time , one ( three ) correspond control volunteer receive NS , order maintain blinding . Approximately 24 hour later , provide criterion call ad hoc SMC meeting meet , remain four volunteer Group 1a also receive 9x10^5 PfSPZ dose vaccine remain two placebo recipient receive NS . After review least +14 day post vaccination safety data Group 1a SMC , significant safety concern , two volunteer ( six ) Group 1b receive 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ , two volunteer ( six ) Groups 2a 3a receive 9x10^5 PfSPZ , PfSPZ Vaccine , demonstrate safety tolerability , sentinel group join one correspond NS control order maintain blinding . Approximately 24 hour later , provide criterion call ad hoc SMC meeting meet , remain four volunteer Group 1b receive 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ remain four volunteer Groups 2a 3a receive 9x10^5 PfSPZ PfSPZ Vaccine , remain placebo recipient receive NS . After review least +14 day post vaccination safety data Groups 1b , 2a 3a SMC , significant safety concern , two volunteer ( six ) Groups 2b 3b receive 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ , Group 4a receive 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ 3 volunteer Group 5a receive 2.7x10^5 PfSPZ PfSPZ Vaccine , demonstrate safety tolerability , sentinel group ( two volunteer Groups 2b , 3b 4a ) join one NS control order maintain blinding . Approximately 24 hour later , provide criterion call ad hoc SMC meeting meet , remain four volunteer Groups 2b , 3b 4a receive appropriate dose PfSPZ Vaccine ( 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ , 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ , 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ , respectively ) , placebo recipient receive NS . Escalation small group infant , ( Group 5a , n=3 ) receive single dose 2.7x10^5 PfSPZ , full group ( Group 5b , n=6 ) receive three dos 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ , proceed without SMC review criterion call ad hoc SMC meeting meet . However , criterion meet , ad hoc SMC meeting call review data , dose escalation 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ postpone recommendation SMC available . The interval 2.7x10^5 PfSPZ small group 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ large group minimum three day . After review least +14 day post vaccination , safety data Groups 2b , 3b , 4a , 5a 5b SMC , significant safety concern , two volunteer ( six ) Groups 4b 5c receive 9x10^5 PfSPZ , demonstrate safety tolerability . At time , one ( three ) correspond control volunteer receive NS , order maintain blinding . Approximately 24 hour later , provide criterion call ad hoc SMC meeting meet , remain four volunteer Group 4b 5c receive 9x10^5 PfSPZ dose vaccine , placebo recipient receive NS .</detailed_description>
