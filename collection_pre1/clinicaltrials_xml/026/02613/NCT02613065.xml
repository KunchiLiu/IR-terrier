	<brief_summary>The purpose project determine protein less likely create positive energy balance add diet compare carbohydrate . To , investigator take detailed measurement participant 's baseline metabolic rate understand energy requirement . Then , investigator fee participant meal two week , Monday-Friday , measure food intake . During one week-long feeding period , participant consume shake make egg protein ~20 % energy requirement . During week , participant consume shake make carbohydrate ~20 % energy requirement . Participants drink assigned shake begin daily three meal , offer 'regular ' meal unlimited quantity . Participants know investigator measure food consume drink shake . Participants drink protein shake first week carb-based shake second week , vice versa -- depend randomization order . To account energy expenditure , participant wear activity monitor , accelerometer . Energy balance , measure participant energy intake minus energy expenditure , main outcome treatment . However , participant may change behavior make aware true research question , investigator tell participant purpose study see low fiber high fiber shake affect mood . The hypothesis week participant consume protein shake , remain energy balance , week carbohydrate shake consumption , participant positive energy balance .</brief_summary>
