	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety efficacy noninvasive cortical electrostimulation therapy know `` Reduced Impedance Noninvasive Cortical Electrostimulation '' ( RINCE ) treatment pain associate fibromyalgia . Patients meet 2010 American College Rheumatology criterion fibromyalgia receive 24 RINCE treatment deliver medical device call `` NeuroPoint '' . Approximately 45 fibromyalgia patient randomize one three study group . One group receive sham treatment , mean receive treatment . A second group receive active RINCE treatment nominal signal amplitude level ( treatment mode 1 ) . A third group receive active RINCE treatment high nominal signal amplitude level ( treatment mode 2 ) . The study 's primary outcome measure difference active sham treatment group mean change baseline patient ' 24-hour recall average pain score . The study 's hypothesis difference treatment group primary outcome measure .</brief_summary>
