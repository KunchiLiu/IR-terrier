	<brief_title>Safety Evaluation Intra-Operative MRI-Based Guidance Laser Ablation Epidural Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Visits : If agree take part study , surgery : - You physical exam . - You neurological exam ( test check function nerve , include test balance reflex ) . - You complete questionnaire pain symptom take 10-15 minute . - You sign separate consent spinal surgery explain risk . During Surgery : You position lie face stomach surgery . While anesthesia , MRI use take image spine . This intraoperative MRI , meaning perform special magnet locate inside specifically design operating room . These image load computer navigation program use help doctor perform surgery . Markers also attach skin back . These marker use together navigation program MRI image record location spine doctor cut . This recording compare MRI image . Your doctor check accuracy record 2 way : - Placing tip navigation probe skin compare computer calculation computer navigation program . This standard navigation probe commonly use spinal surgery . - Inserting navigation probe small cut skin along surgical area take x-ray image location . If difference result 2 measurement , doctor use result first step check accuracy MRI image . If 2 millimeter difference visual inspection position computer model position , doctor may decide one follow step : - Restart record process get new MRI image - Use x-ray image complete procedure - Stop surgery On Day After Surgery : - You physical exam . - You neurological exam . - You complete questionnaire . Follow-Up Visits : The research staff call 3 week surgery ask recovery ask answer questionnaire . You return follow-up visit surgery : - You physical exam . - You neurological exam . - You complete questionnaire . Length Study Participation : Your participation study follow-up visit . You take study surgery doctor think navigation accurate , injure related inaccurate image guidance , surgery stop . This investigational study . The MRIs x-ray study perform use FDA-approved commercially available method . The use MRI image guidance spinal surgery investigational . Up 10 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
