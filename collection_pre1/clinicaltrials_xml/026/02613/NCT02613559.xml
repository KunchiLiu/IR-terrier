	<brief_summary>The purpose first-in-human study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics tolerability single ascending dos TK001 ( Recombinant humanize anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody ) determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) neovascular wet age-related macular degeneration ( wAMD ) subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Pharmacokinetics , Safety , Tolerability TK001 Patients With Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-comparative , non-randomized , single-center phase 1 study evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability single intravitreal injection TK001 patient AMD.TK001 full-length recombinant humanize anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody . Compared Avastin ( similar market product ) , findings preclinical study suggest TK001 might effective inhibit pathological angiogenesis , achieve equivalent effect less dosage well safety . In study , participant administrate single dose TK001.Every subject accept one dose . In addition safety preliminary efficacy , pharmacokinetics immunogenicity TK001will evaluate well .</detailed_description>
