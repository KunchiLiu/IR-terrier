	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial compare yoga , survivorship health education program , cognitive behavioral therapy reduce sleep disturbance ( insomnia ) cancer survivor . Insomnia describe excessive daytime napping , difficulty fall asleep , difficulty stay asleep , wake earlier desire . Insomnia increase fatigue , impair physical function , impair immune function , cause circadian rhythm ( know biological clock ) disrupt decrease quality life . Yoga may improve circadian rhythm , physical immune function , improve insomnia sleep quality cancer survivor . It yet know whether yoga effective treat insomnia health education program cognitive behavioral therapy program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine Yoga Cancer Survivors ( YOCAS ) effective improve patient-reported insomnia ( Insomnia Severity Index ) compare Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Insomnia ( CBT-I ) health education control immediately post intervention . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine YOCAS effective improve objective symptom insomnia ( sleep latency , sleep efficiency , wake sleep onset , sleep duration , daytime nap via actigraphy ) global sleep quality impairment ( Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ) compare CBT-I health education control . II . To examine YOCAS CBT-I effective maintaining improvement insomnia ( Insomnia Severity Index ) 3 6 month post intervention compare health education control . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore whether YOCAS effective improve circadian activity rhythm ( 24 12 hour amplitude acrophases measure via actigraphy ) , physical function ( i.e. , cardiopulmonary [ 6-minute ( min . ) walk ] muscular function [ dynamometry ] ) , inflammation ( interleukin [ IL ] -6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-1beta , interferon [ IFN ] -gamma , &amp; tumor necrosis factor receptor [ TNFR ] 1 via standardize enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ ELISA ] ) compare CBT-I health education control . II . To explore whether change circadian activity rhythm , physical function inflammation mediate effect YOCAS insomnia . III . To explore time-varying nature physical activity behavior cancer treatment develop new methodological approach jointly model longitudinally measure exposure outcome subject measurement error modification personal characteristic physical activity intervention study . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 arm . ARM I : Patients undergo YOCAS intervention comprise 18 specific physical posture mindfulness exercise focus breathe meditation meet yoga instructor 75 minute 2 time week 4 week . ARM II : Patients undergo CBT-I intervention comprise sleep education , sleep hygiene , sleep restriction , stimulus control , cognitive therapy , relapse prevention deliver health professional 90 minute week 8 week . ARM III : Patients attend survivorship health education session 75 minute 2 time week 4 week base American Society Clinical Oncology cancer survivorship educational recommendation deliver community health educator . Patients also receive booklet entitle , `` Cancer Survivorship Next Steps Patients Their Families . '' After completion study , patient follow 3 6 month .</detailed_description>
