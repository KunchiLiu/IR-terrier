	<brief_title>Metabolism Fibrinogen Apolipoprotein B-100 Childhood Obesity Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . SPECIFIC AIMS : Evidence literature suggest : 1. childhood onset obesity increase risk obesity cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) adulthood ; 2. plasma fibrinogen apolipoprotein B-100 ( apoB-100 ) level elevate obesity ; 3. elevate level plasma fibrinogen apolipoprotein B-100 ( apoB-100 ) major independent risk factor CVD adult ; 4. raise plasma fibrinogen level obese child and/adolescents could major factor responsible CVD morbidity mortality adulthood ; 5. low level physical activity associate high level plasma fibrinogen adult ; 6. physical training control diet prove non-pharmacological way improve hemostatic function adult , thereby reduce heart disease risk . Despite evidence mechanism change remain unclear . A good understanding mechanism change lead directed therapy reduce risk factor early life . The increased plasma concentration fibrinogen ( and/or protein ) decide equilibrium two dynamic process body , namely , synthesis degradation rate protein . Therefore , elevate level fibrinogen must consequence : 1. increase fibrinogen synthesis ; 2. decrease fibrinogen degradation 3. contribution . For design effective therapy important know , whether increase concentration plasma fibrinogen due increase synthesis decrease degradation . Using stable isotope mass spectrometry technique possible measure synthesis rate proteins vivo human . Yet report direct measurement FSR fibrinogen and/or apoB-100 childhood obesity , important CVD risk factor . The direct measurement degradation rate proteins vivo human , however , easily do . Few study report change concentration fibrinolytic marker plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) D-Dimer obesity . This , however , account small fraction elevate level plasma fibrinogen childhood obesity . On hand recent preliminary result three subject lab show fibrinogen synthesis rate substantially high ( two time ) obese adolescent girl Vs lean control ( please see result `` Preliminary result '' ) . Pro-inflammatory cytokine , particularly interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , know play important role regulation acute phase reactive protein associate inflammation , include fibrinogen . A direct link IL-6 increase FSR plasma fibrinogen childhood obesity CVD , however , unknown . Also , mechanism involve insulin resistance free fatty acid/albumin ratio also equally plausible increase synthesis fibrinogen obesity CVD . Therefore , important understand establish relationship increased FSR fibrinogen regulate factor study two reason : 1. good design effective therapy base result 2. understand pathophysiology change CVD obesity . The overall purpose propose study therefore : 1. expand preliminary data establish observation increase fibrinogen synthesis rate ( three subject ) childhood obesity 2. understand relationship increase FSR fibrinogen change IL-6 , insulin glucose level free fatty acid ( FFA ) level FFA/albumin ratio obese v lean child 3. study effect non-pharmacological intervention program three month ( 12 week ) , involve weight reduction due exercise control diet fibrinogen , apoB-100 cardiovascular risk factor relationship change IL-6 level , insulin/glucose ratio ( measure insulin resistance ) , FFA/albumin ratio . The propose grant use vivo stable isotope ( non-radioactive ) dilution technique , test follow hypothesis : Hypotheses : 1. high rate synthesis fibrinogen apoB-100 contribute substantially elevate level obese child ; 2. plasma fibrinogen apoB-100 concentration synthesis decrease non-pharmacological intervention reduce weight , involve regular physical exercise control diet ; 3 . IL-6 and/or insulin resistance important mechanistic link increase plasma fibrinogen FSR increase CVD risk obesity 4. non-pharmacological intervention program modulate CVD risk factor PAI-1 , D-Dimer , homocysteine , free fatty acid , insulin , glucose , HDL LDL cholesterol level IL-6 concentration along fibrinogen synthesis . Summary Specific Aims Since obesity plasma fibrinogen level important CVD risk factor adult , since childhood obesity major risk factor adult obesity also establish whether due increase FSR fibrinogen , investigator set study follow specific aim : 1 . To investigate metabolism fibrinogen VLDL apoB-100 , CVD risk factor , childhood obesity measure fractional synthetic rate ( FSR ) compare lean age sex match control 2 . To determine outcome three month non-pharmacological intervention ( physical exercise combine control diet ) reduce weight FSR fibrinogen apoB-100 3 . To determine relationship FSR fibrinogen IL-6 obese child potential implication CVD non-pharmacological intervention 4 . To determine CVD risk factor , PAI-1 level , D-Dimer concentration , homocysteine , insulin , free fatty acid , HDL &amp; LDL cholesterol blood pressure response weight reduction ( consequence combine program diet exercise ) .</detailed_description>
