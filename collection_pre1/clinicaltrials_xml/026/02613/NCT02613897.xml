	<detailed_description>The study intend demonstrate complimentary action saxagliptin/dapagliflozin add metformin versus dapagliflozin add metformin regard EGP . Many medication approve treatment T2DM ; however , challenge achieve maintain treatment goal within current sequential therapy approach link shortcoming old class drug . Metformin biguanide drug class act decrease hepatic glucose output subsequently , decrease fast hyperglycemia . Metformin , oral first-line gold standard agent , recommend initial pharmacological therapy glycemic efficacy , weight neutrality , low risk hypoglycemia , beneficial cardiovascular ( CV ) profile . Current sequential add-on second third line oral therapy include oral drug sulfonylurea ( SUs ) thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) . These therapy insulin associate increased risk weight gain hypoglycemia ; therefore , caution recommend use combination therapy agent know cause hypoglycemia . Hypoglycemia clinically important issue optimize treatment emerge evidence hypoglycemia associate negative CV outcome . Efforts patient lose weight part therapeutic lifestyle program undermine therapy lead weight gain . The majority patient T2DM overweight obese , additional weight gain often result reduce treatment efficacy . Over past year , widely recognize management approach T2DM patient ' need personalize base clinical characteristic ( e.g. , likelihood weight gain , risk hypoglycemia , lifestyle preference [ e.g. , many patient may reluctant use injection ] ) ( Inzucchi et al 2012 ) . Based data National Health Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 2010 , HbA1c appropriately control approximately one-third patient use even less stringent target ( Ali et al 2013 ) . Because challenge achieve glycemic control patient T2DM , progressive nature disease , limitation available oral non-oral therapy , significant medical need oral combination treatment option dual add-on therapy patient high baseline HbA1c . Expert group increasingly suggest make use combination therapy early diagnosis improve glycemic control ( Inzucchi et al 2012 , Rodbard et al 2009 ) . In recent study , initiate triple therapy ( pathophysiological-based approach ) patient new onset T2DM versus metformin follow sequential addition SUs basal insulin ( treat-to-fail approach ) demonstrate durable HbA1c reduction 24 month less hypoglycemia initial triple therapy ( Abdul-Ghani et al 2014 ) . Initial combination therapy saxagliptin dapagliflozin add metformin may similar potential durable glucose lower combination low risk hypoglycemia . Treatment saxagliptin dapagliflozin , individually combination metformin , demonstrate favorable safety tolerability profile . These drug low propensity hypoglycemia , therefore address potential key concern add 2 glucose lower agent simultaneously . These drug demonstrate weight neutrality ( saxagliptin ) moderate weight reduction ( dapagliflozin ) . Dapagliflozin also show cause persistent reduction HbA1c weight 2 year therapy . Dapagliflozin recently show increase EGP , , part , may mediate increase plasma glucagon ( Merovci et al ) . In contrast , saxagliptin demonstrate reduce glucagon level , e.g. , response meal ( Sjöstrand et al 2014 ) vildagliptin , also DPP-4 inhibitor , show inhibit EGP ( Balas et al 2007 ) . A second-line oral dual add-on therapy saxagliptin co-administered dapagliflozin could new option , part triple therapy combination include drug complementary mechanism action , oppose effect plasma glucagon concentration , possibly EGP , low risk hypoglycemia , potential moderate weight loss , provide effective patient-friendly approach treatment T2DM .</detailed_description>
