	<brief_summary>This randomize , multicenter , open-label trial combination regimen MK-5172 ( grazoprevir [ GZR ] ) ( 100 mg ) , MK-3682 ( 450 mg ) MK-8408 ( ruzasvir ) ( 60 mg ) 16 week ribavirin ( RBV ) 24 week without RBV cirrhotic ( C ) non-cirrhotic ( NC ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) genotype ( GT ) 1 GT3-infected participant previously fail direct-acting antiviral regimen ( DAA ) . The combination regimen administer two fixed-dose combination ( FDC ) tablet , refer MK-3682B , give once-daily . The study evaluate efficacy combination regimen MK-5172 ( GZR ) , MK-3682 MK-8408 ( ruzasvir ) without ribavirin assess proportion participant achieve Sustained Virologic Response 12 week ( SVR12 ) end study therapy .</brief_summary>
