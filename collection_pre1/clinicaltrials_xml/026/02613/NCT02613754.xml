	<brief_title>Adding Contingency Management Treatment Usual Disordered Gambling .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Behavioural approach direct powerful way modify problematic behaviour . The prediction add best-practice CM treatment TAU reduce gamble behaviour gamble urge great degree standard counselling practice . Background Problematic gamble significant Canadian public health concern cause harm gambler , family , society large ( Huang &amp; Boyer , 2007 ) . Approximately 4 % Albertans gamble problematic way result significant financial loss , personal distress , relationship break-downs , case suicide ( Williams et al. , 2011 ; Problem Gambling Institute Ontario , 2014 ) . However , recent trend appear show decline seek treatment despite relatively consistent problem/disordered gamble prevalence rate ( Williams et al. , 2011 ) . Further , 33 % - 50 % treatment seeker drop prior issue resolve ( Leblonde et al. , 2003 ) , severe gamble problem high drop-out rate ( ibid ) . One possible reason issue lack immediate benefit client gain treatment attendance . One treatment approach provide immediate benefit treatment attendance superior treatment efficacy substance alcohol dependence contingency management ( Petry , 2010 ) . Contingency management use motivational incentive , typically voucher exchangeable retail good service , reward participant receive provide evidence target behavior withholding participant fail perform behaviour . This treatment use successfully several country treatment various addictive substance ( Garcia-Rodriguez et al. , 2009 ; Peirce et al. , 2006 ) , promote healthy behaviour ( Petry et al. , 2011 ) . Meta-analyses consistently find contingency management report improve clinical outcome high treatment effect size ( Dutra et al. , 2010 ; Prendergast et al. , 2006 ) . Further , contingency management program typically report great likelihood program completion standard care ( Lott &amp; Jencius , 2009 ) , positive effect treatment persist many month treatment completion ( Petry &amp; Martin , 2002 ) . Researchers suggest contingency important mechanism treatment gamble ( Petry et al. , 2006 ; Christensen , 2013 ) , variable regular nature receipt gamble win associate development problematic gambling ( Blaszczynski &amp; Nower , 2002 ) , contingency management use approach reverse association . Moreover , recent research suggest development non-gambling reinforcement successfully compete gamble experience result reduction gamble behaviour increase alternative , pro-social , behaviour ( Jackson et al. , 2013 ) . Although CM appear successful , previously apply problematic gambling ( West , 2008 ) . However , issue pilot procedure ( Christensen , 2013 ) , program implement non-standard , notably reinforcer delay , infrequent , low level , result modest CM treatment outcome ( Petry , 2010 ) . This proposal use technique show improve efficacy CM program . These ; 1 ) increase rate incentive sustain performance target behaviour reset follow lapse ( Petry et al. , 2006 ) , 2 ) provide incentive regular interval ( Christensen , 2013 ) , 3 ) provide incentive soon practicable evidence target behaviour provide ( Zeiler , 1977 ; Griffith et al. , 2000 ) , 4 ) provide sufficiently meaningful incentive ( Dallery et al. , 2001 ) . These addition standard CM procedure , typically use successful treatment substance dependence ( Chopra et al. , 2011 ) , hopefully improve treatment efficacy CM disorder gambler .</detailed_description>
