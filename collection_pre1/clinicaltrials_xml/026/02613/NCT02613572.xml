	<brief_summary>Because iron-chelating antioxidant properities , alpha lipoic acid may treatment geographic atrophy secondary age-related macular degeneration . There ample publish data safety pharmacokinetics alpha lipoic acid adult . However , much data safety tolerability high dos alpha lipoic acid elderly population . The purpose Phase I protocol determine safety/tolerability concern see high dos alpha lipoic acid take subject 65 year age old . The objective Phase 2 protocol determine effect ALA progression GA subject AMD . The central hypothesis , base exist literature , oral ALA reduces rate enlargement GA AMD subject . The rationale antioxidant iron chelate effect ALA slow one major pathway responsible GA progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alpha Lipoic Acid Geographic Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I ( Apr 2016 complete ) : 15 subject , 65 year age old take alpha lipoic acid follow schedule : 600 mg daily meal 5 day . If tolerate , subject take 800 mg daily meal 5 day . If tolerate , subject take 1200 mg daily meal 5 day . Phase II : Randomized , double-blind placebo control pilot trial . Upon completion dose tolerability test , plan enroll 50 subject randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) one two study arm : placebo capsule ALA 1200 mg orally daily , assume 1200 mg well tolerated subject Phase 1 . If 1200 mg well-tolerated base Phase 1 data , high tolerable dose use . Four clinical site plan enrollment period estimate 6 month . The primary endpoint mean rate change area GA study eye baseline 18 month evaluate fundus autofluorescence . Subjects refract electronic visual acuity dilate exam baseline , 6 month , 12 month , 18 month . The study conduct outpatient basis study visit last approximately 2-3 hour . Two week 18 month study visit , subject contact share investigator adverse event develop complete 18 month visit . The Investigator shall ensure subject follow-up eye exam schedule within 6 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase I Ages 6590 Female participant must menopausal . Male participant require use contraception . Able give inform consent For study duration ( 15 day ) , subject must remain country , remain within 4 hour travel time ( car airplane ) , access medical care need , provide contact information subject reach need . Blood Pressure great 190/100 baseline visit Pulse great 100 baseline visit Acute ongoing systemic infection History dementia Participant condition , opinion investigator , give unstable medical status . Participant geographic atrophy investigator believe participant candidate enrollment plan Phase 2 trial geographic atrophy . Phase II Inclusion Criteria Age 5590 • Diagnosis geographic atrophy agerelated macular degeneration study eye . The large GA lesion must minimum 0.5 DA ( 1.25 mm2 ) 6 DA size ( 15.0 mm2 ) . GA define one welldefined , usually less circular patch loss RPE , typically exposure underlie choroidal blood vessel . If GA multifocal large lesion &lt; 0.5 DA , least 3 lesion ≥ 250 micron greatest linear diameter . BCVA 20/20 20/400 study eye . Female participant must menopausal . Male participant require use contraception donate sperm study participation . Presence hyperfluorescence edge GA autofluorescence imaging . Ability give inform consent . If subject two eligible eye , eye enrol study . Subject must mail back medication bottle 10 day runin phase , demonstrate take ≥ 80 % capsule . Exclusion Criteria Evidence ocular disease AMD study eye may confound study outcome ( e.g. , History myopic degeneration , choroidal neovascularization , central serous chorioretinopathy , severe diabetic retinopathy , uveitis , vitelliform dystrophy , macular edema ) . Presence geographic atrophy already touch clearly define beta peripapillary atrophy already touch optic disc . Beta peripapillary atrophy define peripapillary atrophy either sclera choroidal vessel clearly visible . Any history intravitreal injection study eye AMD choroidal neovascularization . However , subject develop choroidal neovascularization study eye study , subject receive standard care intravitreal injection treatment per investigator . The subject continue stay study . Treatment CNV diseases nonstudy eye investigator 's discretion . History intravitreal injection agent ( e.g. , triamcinolone ) antiVEGF study eye within last four month prior study enrollment . History laser treatment ( include photodynamic therapy ) macula study eye . History intraocular surgery within 90 day . study eye . History anterior segment laser ( laser peripheral idotomyiridotomy , laser trabecular meshwork , YAG capsulotomy ) within 90 day study eye . Media opacity ( corneal scar , cataract ) would prevent adequate fundus image study eye . Any history participation another therapeutic clinical trial GA . Participation currently within past 30 day another therapeutic clinical trial systemic ocular study medication receive subject . GA study eye due cause AMD History prior use ALA. AREDS ( Age Related Eye Disease Study ) vitamins take standard dos consider exclusion criterion . Taking standard multivitamin consider exclusion criterion . However , multivitamin contain alpha lipoic acid ( also know thioctic acid ) . Taking antioxidant supplement ( standard multivitamin ( bilberry , ALA , vitamin C part multivitamin , vitamin E part multivitamin , similar antioxidant ) within one month enrollment exclusion criterion ; patient discontinue antioxidant supplement one month enrollment order participate . Study subject antioxidant supplement study except AREDS vitamin ALA ( study subject randomize ALA intervention arm ) . Participant condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study 18 month ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control , unstable psychiatric history , move able return plan study visit ) .</criteria>
