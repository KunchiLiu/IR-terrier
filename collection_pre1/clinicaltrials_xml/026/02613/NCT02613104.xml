	<brief_title>Emotion Recognition Modification Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedure : Participants recruit University Clinic , affiliate psychiatric hospital outpatient psychiatric clinic area , public website . Interested participant interview phone determine initial eligibility ; meet criterion invite comprehensive evaluation . For potential participant age 18 , parents/caregivers ask eligibility question child . If child meet initial eligibility criterion , s/he parent/caregiver invite baseline appointment . The baseline appointment take place Ferkauf Graduate School Psychology , Albert Einstein College Medicine Long Island Jewish Hospital . Following informed consent/assent process , participant interview trained research assistant assess clinical treatment history , determine diagnostic eligibility , use SCID . Participants meet eligibility criterion proceed complete baseline measure . Emotion recognition baseline procedure . The baseline task allow measurement participant ' baseline balance point , point equally likely see give face happy sad ( angry ) . Each participant complete 45 trial emotion recognition task face morph sequence happy sad ( angry ) face present , participant force decide whether face sad ( angry ) happy . Imaging paradigm . Following baseline assessment , subgroup participant ( n =15 ) complete task provokes emotion processing system brain scanner , allow measurement brain activation connectivity task . Additionally , diffusion tensor image use assess structural change brain . The task , ask participant identify gender face display either happy fearful expression , use previously study design measure emotion generation region ( specifically hyperactivity amygdala ) emotion regulation control region ( hypoactive PFC ) ( Godlewska , Norbury , Selvaraj , Cowen , &amp; Harmer , 2012 ) . After complete ERM intervention ( two week baseline session ) , interested participant scan image procedure . Activity extract ROI 's compare within-subject basis ass change brain activation functional connectivity follow treatment . A final follow-up scan perform ten week baseline assessment determine whether change brain function maintain time . Intervention : Once baseline measure complete , participant randomize sad-to-happy condition , angry-to-happy condition , control condition ( n =20 per group ) . Participants intervention condition complete training task three time three in-person session . The task similar baseline procedure ; participant view face ask judge expression , however give feedback ( e.g . `` Incorrect ! That face happy . `` ) , order shift category happy face include face two morph step beyond participant 's baseline balance point . Participants control condition repeat baseline task , feedback consistent baseline performance ( i.e . face judge happy initially call `` correct '' judge happy . The intervention administer total three time ( baseline , first follow-up , second follow-up ) . Follow-Up : After final training session , participant complete first follow-up . This consist clinician-administered YMRS , well online questionnaire , include LEE , PANAS , GBI , social network task , Perceived Social Support , feasibility questionnaire . Eight week complete final training session , participant return research lab final follow-up , include follow measure , LEE , PANAS , GBI , social network task , Perceived Social Support , emotion recognition task , YMRS , BDI-II ass change mood episode study follow-up period . Participants also ask complete brief form whether liked intervention find convenient assess burden feasibility .</detailed_description>
