	<brief_summary>In light development high-throughput technology enable biology-based reclassification tumor increase number available specifically target anticancer agent era `` precision medicine '' begin . Several clinical precision medicine trial aim stratify treatment accord molecular profile ( example France : 'MOlecular Screening CAncer Treatment Optimization ' MOSCATO-01 , SHIVA , PROFILER , Safir01 , Safir02 ) ongoing adult show feasibility approach . MOSCATO-01 first trial worldwide include pediatric patient , perform on-purpose intervention molecular profile recurrent tumor . Together 500 adult patient , December 2012 August 2014 , tumor 35 child adolescent profile , confirm approach feasible pediatric patient albeit accelerated time stringency . Importantly , result first child adolescent profile show 2/3 patient 'actionable ' alteration use hot spot mutation sequence CGH array ( Geoerger B et al , ASCO 2014 ) . The project 'MAPPYACTS ' use Whole Exome Sequencing ( WES ) RNA Sequencing tumor tissue increase number targetable genomic alteration . Furthermore improve understand overall molecular profile possible response treatment , methylation array , miRNA expression profile , study immunomodulators perform tumor sample subsequently . CLIP2 ( INCa-labeled early phase clinical trial center ) - SiRIC ( INCa- label comprehensive cancer center ) molecular profile bioinformatics platform contribute expertise molecular profiling project characterization pediatric cancer . Data interpretation molecular genetic alteration detect WES RNA Seq treatment recommendation do within multidisciplinary therapeutic molecular biology tumor board . 'MAPPYACTS ' produce one large cohort molecularly characterize relapsed tumor report date , thanks increase access clinical trial since European pediatric legislation , investigator expect 20-30 % patient stratify target trial base detect profile . It investigators ' intention initiative pave way enrich ongoing clinical target agent trial , increase number stratify clinical trial , early access target agent , play crucial role relevant development new agent pediatric malignancy .</brief_summary>
