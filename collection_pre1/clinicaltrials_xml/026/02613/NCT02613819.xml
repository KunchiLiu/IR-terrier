	<detailed_description>Who ? - Age &gt; 18 year old - All patient must biopsy confirmed diagnosis renal cell carcinoma single lesion within kidney - ECOGperformance 0-2 inclusive . - Life expectancy &gt; 9 month - Either medically inoperable , technically high risk surgery decline surgery . - Multidisciplinary decision active treatment Study Details : Definitive external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) often use treat medically inoperable patient cancer many different organ , include kidney . However , renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) conventionally consider `` radioresistant '' fully fractionate EBRT . In effort overcome perceive `` radioresistance '' RCC , severely hypofractionated EBRT form stereotactic radiotherapy renew interest management renal cell carcinoma radiotherapy . This study evaluate safety effectiveness Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy ( SABR ) treatment cancer kidney . Participants study allocate receive either multi-fraction SABR ( 3 fraction 2 week ) single fraction SABR ( 1 fraction ) . All participant assess regular interval post treatment order estimate activity efficacy technique , evaluate tolerability , estimate survival , estimate distant failure rate , renal function change SABR . The follow-up visit occur 4 week every 3 month 1st year post treatment , every 6 month second year yearly study closure ( 2 year last participant finish study treatment ) .</detailed_description>
