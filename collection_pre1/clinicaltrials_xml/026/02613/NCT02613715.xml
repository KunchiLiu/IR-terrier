	<brief_title>Bioavailability Blackberry Juice Anthocyanins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anthocyanins ( ANT ) , particular class flavonoid find red wine red fruit , associate relevant health benefit . It become clear flavonoid bioactive form vivo necessarily occur nature , metabolites arise absorption . Therefore , important identify ANT metabolites responsible health benefit . Since ANT prevent/treat metabolic feature obesity also crucial study whether ANT bioavailability compromise obesity . An anthropometric evaluation allow classification subject accord body mass index ( BMI ) . A complete medical examination include assessment clinical laboratory parameter also perform characterize health status recruit subject . Before begin study , last fecal sample obtain collect . Urine sample peripheral venous blood ( 10 ml ) collect 10 h-fasting subject . Afterwards , volunteer consume 250 ml blackberry juice without ethanol ( visit 1 2 ) blood sample collect 15 , 30 , 60 120 min juice ingestion . Another urine sample collect 120 min . The first fecal sample obtain least 6 h juice ingestion collect . Blood pressure ( 0 120 min ) glycaemic response ( 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 120 min ) measure visit . Ethanol add blackberry juice mimic concentration present red wine ( 12 % ) . A thorough screening analysis ANT perform plasma urine sample collect volunteer different time point . Fecal sample also collect evaluate relationship presence ANT metabolites gut microbiota composition .</detailed_description>
