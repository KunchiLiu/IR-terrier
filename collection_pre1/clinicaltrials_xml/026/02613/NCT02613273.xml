	<brief_title>CHAMP : A Randomized Controlled Trial High-intensity Aerobic Resistance Exercise Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This PI-initiated , randomized clinical trial 12 week supervise aerobic exercise vs. 12 week supervise resistance exercise vs. usual care among 60 men metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer . Eligible men randomize equal probability one three regimen . All patient receive packet print material diet , exercise , psycho-social support appropriately gear men late stage disease end trial . The aerobic exercise arm ( N=20 ) receive 3 day/week supervise exercise regimen include high-intensity interval train continuous vigorous intensity aerobic exercise training . The resistance exercise arm ( N=20 ) receive 3 day/week resistance exercise regimen incorporate different volume load . Men control arm ( N=20 ) ask continue typical exercise practice 12 week . Subjects ask complete questionnaire , physical function strength test , body measurement , collection blood specimen baseline 12 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically document adenocarcinoma prostate progressive systemic bone node metastatic disease despite castrate level testosterone due orchiectomy luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist . Castrate level testosterone must maintain . Patients must PSA ≥2 ng/ml rise serially least 2 occasion , least one week apart On ADT Gonadotropinreleasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist/antagonist prior bilateral orchiectomy . All patient require ADT throughout study ; ≥4 week since major surgery fully recover . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 Required Initial Laboratory Values : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/uL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal PSA ≥ 2 ng/ml Serum testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL Medical clearance undergo steep ramp test completion steep ramp test Physician consent participate vigorous aerobic resistance exercise training Previously identify small cell neuroendocrine tumor pure small cell carcinoma prostate , base prior biopsy prostate . Brain metastasis ( brain imaging require ) Any prior chemotherapy castrateresistant disease Poorly control hypertension .
