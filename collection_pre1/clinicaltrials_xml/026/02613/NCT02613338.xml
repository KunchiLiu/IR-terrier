	<brief_summary>A good understanding knee joint kinematics important explain premature polyethylene wear failure within total knee arthroplasty ( TKAs ) help design prosthesis closely approximate normal knee . Specifically , posterior stabilizing ( PS ) knees find associate low amount posterior femoral rollback , high occurrence reverse axial rotation increase amount condylar lift-off . The DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction 's Attune PS fix bearing ( FB ) knee system incorporate subtle change design address restoration kinematics closely resemble normal knee . To understand design able effectively restore kinematics implanted knee , vivo analysis necessary . This continuation study analyze 30 subject Attune PS FB 3 month post-operatively use University Tennessee 's mobile fluoroscopy unit perform three daily activity , level walking , ramp deep knee bend .</brief_summary>
