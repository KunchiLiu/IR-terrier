	<brief_title>Hypnotherapy vs. Probiotics Children With IBS Functional Abdominal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder ( FGIDs ) functional abdominal pain ( FAP ) represent considerable part visit pediatric practitioner . These disorder decrease quality life also increase risk symptom persistence comorbid mental issue adulthood . As etiology pathophysiology FGIDs still matter research , several approach manage FGIDs commonly use : dietary intervention , probiotic , drug treatment , psychosocial intervention . While recent meta-analyses show almost favorable effect dietary intervention drug treatment ( 5-HT4 receptor agonist , antispasmodic anti-diarrheal agent , antibiotic ) child FGIDs , probiotic psychosocial intervention remain promising regard effective symptom relief . Several randomize control trial ( RCT ) show beneficial effect gut direct hypnosis ( GDH ) probiotic . To knowledge , study investigate type intervention comparison control group intervention . This study aim fill gap . In prospective randomize study investigator aim obtain preliminary result impact gut-directed hypnotherapy ( GDH ) modify self-practicing probiotic nutritional supplement ( NS ) symptoms child pain-related FGIDs ( IBS FAP ) . This go measured mean number day child experience abdominal pain discomfort . Beside investigator plan obtain data abdominal pain intensity duration effect mention intervention child 's health-related quality life ( KINDL-R ) , pain-related disability ( P-PDI ) , cop ability ( PPCI ) behavioural emotional problem ( CBCL ) . The information obtain child well parental perspective allow extensive model mechanisms change . Beyond psychometric instrument well-established psychophysiological method use . Assessment heart rate variability mental stress condition ( Parametric Go/No-Go test ) measure cortisol awaken response ( CAR ) use study function autonomic nerve system stress-level/tolerance study population . The investigator hypothesize : 1. significant decrease number day pain/discomfort intervention group ( GDH , NS ) compare control group ( active waiting-list control group ) 2. type intervention lead increase quality life decrease pain duration , intensity pain-related disability compare control group . 3. decrease physiological stress parameter ( measure heart rate variability [ HRV ] analysis , cortisol awaken response [ CAR ] ) intervention group compare control group , prominent GDH group . The data pilot study use project promise intervention research parameter investigate detailed large sample . Current study regard pilot conduct order obtain information efficacy GDH probiotic intervention child IBS FAP compare reference group . Based previous study data literature investigator expect see moderate effect power primary outcome measure ( η²~.06 ) . In order detect 50 % improvement symptom 4 week treatment 80 % power , assume α=.05 use 2 x 3 repeated measure design main analysis , 51 participant include study . Taking account possible dropout investigator plan recruit 60 child ( 20 child per group ) . Short description study protocol : Parents interested study first contact investigator receive detailed information study short anamnestic questionnaire . After return invite together child diagnostic appointment ( `` Visit I '' ) . Inclusion study make base result anamnestic interview well base report responsible gastroenterologist regard exclusion possible reason symptom ( include organic disorder , e.g . Celiac disease ) . Participants parent also receive necessary information goal study method use study well possible health risk apply intervention . Informed consent sign prior inclusion study . After inclusion , child parent ask change currently use medication undertake another treatment , well change usual habit end follow-up period . Participants fill diary question symptom day . During first two week ( `` run-in period '' ) participant keep symptom diary . This data use later analysis `` baseline '' data comparison change occur due intervention . The week three four regard `` wash-out period '' : participant instruct stop answering question diary . The investigator hypothesize reduce effect self-monitoring treatment start . At end week four , child randomize one three group : base computer generate table random number participant allocate either group practice gut-directed hypnosis receive probiotic next four week ( SymbioLact B ) reference group ( symptom diary ) . Participants randomize aspect ratio 1:1:1 . Children continue keep symptom diary another two week ( week 9 10 ) return investigator `` Visit II '' end 10th week . Visits I II also use collect psychometric data child parent well psychophysiological measure ( HRV ) . Saliva sample collect home : participant provide appropriate collection tube well detailed instruction collect , store deliver sample investigation site . Baseline saliva sample collect inside first week week 10 ( morning Visit II ) . For ethical reason , second intervention choose freely family follow-up period . Risks study : A systematic review meta-analysis randomized clinical trial effect probiotic child pain-related FGID well RCTs report seldom adverse effect probiotic . If appear - often form gastroenteritis vomit - adverse effect comparable placebo group . Based previous study group expect adverse event gut direct hypnosis . All adverse event group document report .</detailed_description>
