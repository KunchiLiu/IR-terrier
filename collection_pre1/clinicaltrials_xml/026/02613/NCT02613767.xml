	<brief_summary>There increase number individual United States obesity , major health concern link many chronic disease . Impairments protein metabolism obesity may disrupt muscle function modify dietary protein requirement obese individual . Further , overweight obese type 2 diabetic exhibit dramatically reduce skeletal muscle mass compare lean , healthy control . Surprisingly , influence overweight obese decline muscle mass remain understudied , despite clear evidence similar metabolic impairment typically exist population prior development overt diabetes . Protein ingestion provide amino acid build block synthesize repair muscle proteins adult . Previous research show muscle protein synthetic response food ingestion may reduce overweight/obese adult . However , research provide 'free ' amino acid small portion every 15 min postprandial period . In free living condition , however , common consume protein dense food single portion . Currently , information available eating protein rich food affect muscle protein synthesis overweight obese adult . This propose research fill research gap first study compare muscle protein synthetic response ingestion meal-like amount high quality protein lean , overweight obese adult . The objective study determine muscle protein synthetic response consumption 35g pork protein lean , overweight obese adult . In order ass objective researcher propose use prim continuous infusion L- [ ring-13C6 ] phenylalanine measure muscle protein synthesis rate consumption dietary protein . In parallel design researcher study 13 obese ( BMI 30-39.9 kg/m2 ) participant , 13 overweight ( BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2 ) , 13 age-matched lean control ( BMI 18-24.9 kg/m2 ) age 20 45 year . All subject sedentary weight stable previous 6 month . On test day , subject remain sedentary determination muscle protein synthesis fast state consumption protein meal . Blood muscle sample occur test day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants ask report laboratory 7:00 follow overnight fast . Upon arrival , Teflon catheter insert antecubital vein one arm arterialize blood sample baseline blood sample drawn . Arterialized blood sample obtain wrap subject ' forearm heating blanket ( 45 °C ) 10 min prior blood collection time point . A second Teflon catheter insert antecubital vein opposite arm , participant receive prim dose L- [ ring- 13C6 ] phenylalanine ( 2.0 µmol∙kg ) prior initiate continuous infusion L- [ ring-13C6 ] phenylalanine ( 0.05 µmol∙kg∙min ) ( t=-240 ) . The prime continuous tracer infusion pass 0.2 μm filter . Blood collect every 1 hour biopsy vastus lateralis collect t=-180 t=-15 min use 5 mm Bergström needle ( modify manual suction ) 2 % xylocaine local anesthesia measurement postabsorptive muscle protein synthesis rate . The second biopsy ( t=-15 min ) use determine baseline level phosphorylated total protein involve nutrient sense muscle anabolic signaling . Subsequently , participant ingest 6 oz fresh ground center cut pork loin . This cut meat select due low lipid content ( 2.5-3 % ) uniform shape , size composition . Along ingested pork , participant consume 300 mL water . The water enrich 5 % tracer accord phenylalanine content ~4 % pork . This approach require minimize disturbance isotopic steady state provide appropriate condition calculation postprandial muscle protein synthesis rate . The time require consume pork record . The completion pork meal water mark start postprandial phase ( t=0 ) . During period , arterialize blood sample collect evacuate chilled heparinized tube t=30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 300 min . Additional muscle biopsy collect t=120 300 min experimental infusion measurement postprandial muscle protein synthetic muscle anabolic signal protein response . The muscle biopsy sample free visible blood , fat , connective tissue , rapidly frozen liquid nitrogen store -80˚C analysis . Blood sample centrifuge 1,000×g 4˚C 10 min separate plasma transfer 2.0 ml cryovials . The plasma sample store -20˚C analysis .</detailed_description>
