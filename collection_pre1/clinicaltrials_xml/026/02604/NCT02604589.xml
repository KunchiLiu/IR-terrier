	<brief_summary>Rib fracture common injury accident patient associate significant pain recovery . If poorly control , pain splint due rib fracture result difficulty breathe lead incomplete expansion lung , even need put patient ventilator help breathe . Therefore , pain control critical managing patient rib fracture . To date , many study show effectiveness continuous intercostal nerve blockade ( slow release pain medication site injury prevents transmission pain signal ) . This approach never study randomized fashion rib fracture patient , never compare patient-controlled narcotic pain medication , commonly use many hospital . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness placement elastomeric infusion pump ( small , external , wearable balloon use deliver medication time ) attach continuous infusion catheter `` soaker '' catheter ( tube release pain medication tiny hole , right site injury ) deliver local anesthetic medication reduce pain cause two rib fracture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment rib fracture use elastomeric infusion pump ( small , external , wearable balloon use deliver medication time ) contain pain medication continuous infusion catheter `` soaker '' catheter ( tube release pain medication tiny hole , right site injury ) place extrathoracic paraspinous space ( site back near break rib ) create continuous intercostal nerve block relatively novel . Truitt colleague publish two study evaluate effectiveness approach . A pilot study 30 patient publish 2010 show placement catheter safe , viable effective procedure , result decreased pain score rib fracture patient . A second study include 102 patient study prospectively ( time admission hospital ) compare epidural anesthesia ( injection anesthetic spine ) local catheter delivery non-randomized fashion 2011 . This approach begin widely use , never study randomized fashion , never compare patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA , delivery pain medication push button ) , commonly use many hospital . We hypothesize accident patient two rib fracture receive pain control continuous infusion system achieve improve pain control dose-dependent fashion , improve lung function , therefore , require less narcotic pain medication , achieve discharge criterion earlier short hospital length stay comparison patient treat PCA alone .</detailed_description>
