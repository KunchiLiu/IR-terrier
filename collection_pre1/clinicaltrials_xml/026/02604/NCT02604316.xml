	<brief_title>SATIN : Satiety Innovation . Study 2- University Aberdeen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research suggest food structure food composition role play control consumption . Low-energy , high-fibre diet provide physical bulk gastro-intestinal tract sustain fullness way low-volume , energy-dense food . However , study show low long term acceptability probably associate poor palatability . Taste hedonic experience remain main driver consumer choice , immediate sensory aspect food product palatability great salience consumer health promote property . Changing property food merely change oro-sensory property delay gastric empty deal mechanisms critical within-meal satiation early post meal satiety may produce transient suppression hunger unless regularly consume represent benefit deliver nutritional stimulus key part gastro-intestinal tract . The potential manufacture change make food structure variety seem near limitless due numerous advance food technology . Several recent report associate satiety effect fermentable fibre source human dietary study . Apparently , large intestine microbiota recovers 'extra ' calorie diet might contributes obesity . However , different mechanism involve lean obese subject completely resolve . Recent evidence experimental animal design indicate change gut microbiota composition may associate increase food intake obesity suggest satiety intake influenced specie composition gut microbiota . This short-term human nutrition study comprises randomise , cross-over design test either two potentially satiety product , Arabinoxylan ( A ) Beta-glucan ( B ) equivalent amount heterogeneous natural fibre ( Control ) 40 healthy-obese volunteer , age 18-65 year old , BMI 27 42Kg/m2 gender initial maintenance diet free- living condition . Dietary intake , body weight , blood pressure would monitor study . Faecal , urine blood sample collect monitor , glucose , insulin , gut peptide assess metabolite dietary microbial origin . Orocecal Transit Time ( OCTT ) , carbohydrate fermentability methanogen status estimate use breath test transit time determine use SmartPillâ„¢ .</detailed_description>
