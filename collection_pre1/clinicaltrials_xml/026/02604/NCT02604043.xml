	<brief_title>Continuous Supraglottic pH Monitoring Prolonged Intubated Intensive Care Patients High Risk Aspiration Intraoperative Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aspiration serious morbidity lead increase patient mortality duration hospital stay . Many practice exist within hospital set whose goal help prevent clinically significant aspiration include preoperative starvation , pharmaceutically reduce gastric acidity , facilitate gastric drainage , postural change , cricoid pressure , endotracheal cuff pressure modification , maintenance competent low esophageal sphincter . However , date , monitor system exist help clinician identify active aspiration . At present , video fluoroscopy , gold standard detect aspiration . This pilot prospective cohort study examine incidence supraglottic pH reading . A continuous pH/impedence sensor place immediately glottic open four high risk population : burn patient intubate , intubated post-stroke patient , patient undergo robotic prostectomy , patient undergo peritoneal tumor debulking chemotherapy . The presence acidic fluid glottic opening measure use supraglottic impendence/pH probe attach endotracheal tube .</detailed_description>
