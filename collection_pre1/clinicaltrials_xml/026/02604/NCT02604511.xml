	<brief_title>Study Ibrutinib Patients With Symptomatic , Previously Untreated Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia , Impact Tumor Genomic Evolution Using Whole Genome Sequencing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve ibrutinib form treatment patient specific disease . Ibrutinib investigation research study participants recurrent B-cell lymphoma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) , mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) , diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , prolymphocytic leukemia , WM . In study ibrutinib relapsed/refractory WM patient , response rate high treatment well tolerate . The prior study suggest ibrutinib may useful treatment strategy untreated WM patient . This study test safety efficacy ibrutinib option untreated WM patient . The study also conduct genomic sequencing malignant WM cell start treatment , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 month afterwards . Genomic sequence analysis entire DNA structure tumor normal cell . The purpose sequence study genetic change effect ibrutinib work . The result study could also help good understand course WM disease , applicable development effective drug treatment .</detailed_description>
