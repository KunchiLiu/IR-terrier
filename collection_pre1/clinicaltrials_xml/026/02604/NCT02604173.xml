	<detailed_description>Enrollment : A total One hundred healthy male female participant ( group 25 time ) enrol study administrator Owens Valley Lab , White Mountain Research Station . Pregnant woman exclude . The study enrollment period run approximately 12 day 4 weekend August 2016 . Advertisement study sea level local around Stanford University well email chain outdoor group attempt gather cohort sea-level participant . Study : Eligible participant randomize double blind fashion morning ascent acetazolamide 125 mg PO bid empty inhaler , budesonide ( 200 mcg ) inhaler bid visually match placebo pill , visually match placebo empty inhaler . After informed consent sign , participant complete baseline demographic sheet , LLQ , pulse oximetry reading , perform pulmonary function test prior take study medication . Participants take study capsule inhaler leave OVL , order reveal significant acute adverse reaction leave high altitude . In highly unlikely event adverse reaction , participant close proximity study administrator first aid medicine treat allergic reaction ( Benadryl , Ranitidine , Prednisone , Epinephrine ) , communication BAR code break medical evaluation . In morning healthy participant without adverse reaction drive Barcroft Gate 11,700 ' , continue foot Barcroft Research Station ( BAR ) 12,500 ' . The study subject allow hike pace minimal restriction include travel 13,054 ' ( Barcroft Summit ) . The participant spend night BAR evaluate within 6 hour arrival morning ( LLQ , pulse oximetry , pulmonary function testing , side effect data , compliance ) . After data collection morning arrival , study complete participant . Participants significant illness remove trial appropriate safety measure take ( Twenty-four hour access truck evacuation low elevation OVL - definitive treatment AMS ) . Every effort make secure incomplete data abort study early . The high scoring AMS data use primary secondary outcome analysis . Procedures : Two data collection timeline coordinate , one within 6 hour subject arrival BAR second morning night sleep BAR . Five study variable assess include LLQ , pulse oximetry , pulmonary function testing , side effect data , compliance . The LLQ widely use standardized self-report clinical survey use quantitation AMS . A diagnosis AMS LLQ require score 2 great mandatory presence headache least one follow symptom : dizziness lightheadedness , fatigue , GI symptom ( nausea/vomiting ) , difficulty sleeping ( Maggiorini et al. , 1998 ; Roach et al. , 1993 ) . AMS symptom evaluate establish space time ( several hour one day normally ) symptom quantify . In study , symptom evaluate within 6 hour arrival endpoint altitude , next morning capture manifestation disease . The high LLQ score use score altitude , irrespective AMS diagnosis . This methodology take account variable timeline individual expression AMS symptomatology . Oxygen saturation rough correlation AMS symptom , measure use pulse oximeter , validate use high altitude ( Nonin Onyx , Nonin Medical Products , Minneapolis , MN ) . Pulmonary Function Testing : Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , Peak Expiratory Flow Volume ( PEF ) . achieve portable spirometer . Values baseline level altitude compute . Spirometry perform accord guideline American Thoracic Society . Side Effects Data record patient may experience secondary intervention inhale budesonide acetazolamide placebo . Compliance verify whether subject follow intervention guideline data completion Interventions : Commercial pharmaceutical-grade acetazolamide purchase Advantage Pharmaceuticals pack lactulose capsule Advantage Pharmaceuticals process plant Rocklin , CA . The placebo substance visually identical acetazolamide , placebo drug pack visually identical capsule . Budesonide visually identical chamber donate AstraZeneca . Prior study establish medicate empty inhalant indistinguishable study participant ( Zheng et al. , 2014 , Cheng et al. , 2014 ) The packaging capsule inhalant placebo randomize 1:1:1 strategy . The first dose take least 4 hour ascent 100 participant three arm : placebo ( 34 participant ) , Acetazolamide 125mg ( 33 participant ) , budesonide 200 mcg ( 33 participant ) . The intervention code prepared Advantage Pharmaceutical use computer-generated random sequence , place seal opaque envelope unavailable study administrator enroll patient . Allocation randomize , blind study capsule occur site baseline altitude first-come , first-served basis participant identify order minimize bias . Success blind evaluate best guess intervention question , well statistical evaluation baseline characteristic assess imbalance random allocation study capsule . A sealed unblinding envelope randomization code hold researcher BAR well non-study affiliated physician Stanford University Hospital event allergic reaction need medical intervention . A word meal accommodation : Both Owens Valley Lab Barcroft Station full time chef staff year-long prepare meal stay respective station . There wide range option , full kitchen , vegetarian , vegan , normal diet option . Meals serve buffet- style participant able eat like , much like . Although meal vary daily basis , average dinner meal might approximately 2,500 calorie include pasta , meatball , salad , garlic bread , soup , steam vegetable option . If option day suit , chef discus individually participant option . Standard breakfast include cereal , egg , sausage , toast , oatmeal , etc . Standard lunch usually sack-lunch variety often sandwich option fruit snack . Throughout day `` snack '' portion kitchen open fruit , sandwich supply , assortment bar , chip , etc . Participants encourage bring snack snack preference hike . The station ask participant assist clean much possible . No drug alcohol allow . Accommodations : All participant provide accommodation site require bring bedding ( ie . sleep bag ) towel . A single twin bed provide , arrange alone bunk great 8 people per co-ed room . If participant would rather camp outside , also permit . Showers toilet available .</detailed_description>
