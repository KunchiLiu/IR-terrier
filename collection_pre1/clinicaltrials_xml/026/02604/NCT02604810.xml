	<brief_summary>This study design determine dose weekly subcutaneously administer Immune Globulin Subcutaneous ( Human ) , 20 % Caprylate/Chromatography Purified ( Grifols ) ( IGSC 20 % ) produce steady-state AUC total IgG non-inferior regularly administer intravenous dose Immune Globulin Injection ( Human ) , 10 % Caprylate/Chromatography Purified ( Grifols ) ( IGIV-C 10 % ) primary immunodeficiency subject . This study also design determine steady state trough total IgG level IGSC 20 % infusion IGIV-C 10 % infusion comparison ass safety tolerability IGSC 20 % .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , open-label , single-sequence , 6-month , pharmacokinetic , safety tolerability study IGSC 20 % subject primary immunodeficiency . Approximately 50 subject enrol order approximately 30 adult subject 12 15 pediatric subject ( age 2-16 year ) complete treatment subcutaneously administer IGSC 20 % . This study include 3 treatment phase : Run-In Phase , IV Phase ( IV administration IGIV-C 10 % treatment ) , SC Phase ( SC administration IGSC 20 % ) . Subjects , depend current IgG treatment regimen , may require enter Run-In Phase receive IV IGIV-C 10 % treatment ( Sponsor provide ) achieve approximately steady-state condition prior enter IV Phase . They enter IV Phase determine AUC profile IV infusion IGIV-C 10 % . Subjects qualify IV IGIV-C 10 % treatment regimen ( stable IGIV-C 10 % dose 300-800 mg/kg ) enter IV Phase directly receive IGIV-C 10 % . In IV Phase , steady-state IV PK assessment , include AUC , perform . After complete IV Phase , subject enter SC Phase receive weekly SC dose IGSC 20 % least 24 week . The PK profile total IgG follow administration IV ( IGIV-C 10 % ) administration SC ( IGSC 20 % ) administration determine compare reach approximate steady-state condition .</detailed_description>
