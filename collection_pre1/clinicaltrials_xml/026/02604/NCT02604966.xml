	<brief_summary>At end 2012 , Institute Tropical Medicine collaboration National Institute Malariology Parasitology Entomology ( NIMPE ) conduct study Quang Nam province , central Vietnam , assess efficacy national DHA-PPQ regimen treatment uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infection , adult child . Results show 30 % study participant parasitaemic day 3 . Parasite clearance rate estimate 6.2h , comparable figure Pailin , Cambodia , artemisinin resistance previously report . However , result study interpreted bearing mind : ( ) age-based drug dose scheme use criticize insufficient clear parasite ( ii ) DHA-PPQ drug use ( Artecan™ ) , Vietnam , produce Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMPs ) . However , result prompt NMCP WHO declare Quang Nam , Binh Phuoc , Dak Nong , Gia Lai provinces `` Tier I area '' ( credible evidence artemisinin resistance ) May 2013 . By end 2014 fifth province , Khanh Hoa , declare Tier I ( Dr Hong , Personal Communication ) . Except south-eastern province Binh Phuoc , artemisinin resistance never confirm artemisinin base monotherapy Central Vietnam . Therefore , order confirm artemisinin resistance Central Vietnam , study oral artemisinin-based monotherapy , use WHO prequalified AS DHA-PPQ recommend dose scheme 4mg/kg/day AS DHA , need . In arm study participant treat 3 day AS monotherapy , treatment follow additional 3-day course DHA-PPQ effectively clear parasite . The aim present study confirm artemisinin resistance Central Vietnam assess P. falciparum clearance time rate AS monotherapy ( WHO recommend dosage ) . The investigator conduct two-arm open label , randomize study , one arm receiving AS monotherapy 3 day + 3-day DHA-PPQ , second arm receive 3 day DHA-PPQ .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3.1 Study Design This study design randomize open label 42-day follow-up study evaluate clinical parasitological response treatment uncomplicated P.falciparum infection either AS DHA-PPQ . Symptomatic patient P.falciparum mono-infections , fulfil study criterion , enrol study , randomize one treatment arm follow 42 day . All drug administration directly observe patient actively followed-up 42 day accord extend WHO protocol . At end follow-up time , patient carry gametocyte treat single dose Primaquine ( 0.75mg/kg ) follow national guideline . 3.2 . Study site population The study carry Krong Pa district , Gia Lai province P.falciparum P.vivax malaria incidence high country . The study locate Chu R'Cam commune study team work together local health staff surround commune health center malaria patient . The local population mainly compose Gia Rai ethnic minority whose main occupation consist slash burn agriculture ( mainly maize , manioc rice ) forest field , together seasonal work rubber plantation , small-scale production good daily subsistence trade e.g . coffee cashew nut . The climate tropical dry season November April rainy season May October . The area hilly forest ( secondary forest ) main malaria vector Anopheles dirus . 3.4 . Trial Population The target population include P. falciparum infect patient either present spontaneously CHC refer health staff surround CHCs . 3.5 . Trial procedure 3.5.1 Screening . All consult patient meet basic enrolment criterion screen assigned consecutive screening number evaluate great depth medical doctor . Once patient meet enrolment criterion , ( parent guardian case child ) ask consent participate study allocate study number ( ID=sequential number ) . Any person decide participate study examine , treat followed-up health facility staff accord standard care establish Ministry Health . 3.5.2 . Randomisation Treatment Allocation Randomization carry block 10 allocation ratio 1:1 . At enrolment , patient interview examine physically standardize pre-coded questionnaire fill . A venous blood sample collect sterile vacutainer tube contain EDTA acid-citrate-dextrose ( EDTA/ACD ) patient enrolment . A minimum 5ml blood -and maximum 8 ml- collect adult , 1ml/kg 5ml collected child . Two blood drop add 1.5 ml tube contain 500 µL RNAprotect reagent ( Qiagen ) . 3.5.3 Treatment All patient receive full treatment either AS alone ( 4mg/kg/day ) DHA-PPQ ( target dose DHA=4mg/kg/day ) 3 day order evaluate early parasite clearance . Since 3-day course AS insufficient treat P.falciparum , complete additional 3-day DHA-PPQ regimen accord WHO recommendation . Patients observe 60 minute treatment adverse reaction vomit . Those patient vomit medication within first 30 minute receive repeat full dose ; vomit 30-60 minute receive half dose . Rescue medication give follow national guideline : Rescue oral drug : Quinine ( 30mg/kg/day ) clindamycine ( 15mg/kg/day ) 7days ; Rescue IV drug : Quinine ( 30mg/kg/day ) doxycycline ( 3mg/kg/day ) 7days 3.5.4 . Follow From Day 0 parasite clearance : first dose antimalaria drug administer observed one hour , patient monitor every 12 hour blood microscopy least day 3 longer necessary parasite clearance define two consecutive negative slide . At visit , patient interview examine physically , follow-up form complete adverse event document . A finger prick blood sample collect follow outcome : two blood slide LM observation ( thick thin film ) , 200 µl blood EDTA/ACD microtainer tube later DNA extraction , 2 drop blood another microtainer tube contain RNAprotect later RNA extraction . An additional drop blood take Day 3 measure Hb concentration . Day 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 Patients ask attend clinic ( visited home ) follow-up visit , interview examine , follow-up form complete , adverse event document . A finger prick blood sample collect follow outcome : two blood slide LM observation ( thick thin film ) , 200μl blood EDTA/ACD microtainer tube DNA extraction , 2 drop blood RNAprotect contain microtainer tube . At Day 7 , 14 , 28 42 , one drop blood take Hb concentration ( Hemocue ) . Day P. falciparum recurrence Recurrence define P.falciparum parasitaemia detect LM examination patient 's follow-up period initial parasite clearance . If recurrence confirm venous blood sample collect ( minimum 5ml/maximum 8ml ) prior rescue treatment administration : ex-vivo assay do one part blood remain cryopreserved future investigation drug resistance mechanism . 3.5.5 . Loss follow-up &amp; protocol violation Loss follow-up occurs , despite reasonable effort , enrol patient attend schedule visit find . No treatment outcome assign patient . These patient classify lose follow-up censor excluded analysis . Study patient meet follow criterion classify withdrawn : ) withdrawal consent ; ii ) failure complete treatment ; iii ) enrolment violation ; iv ) voluntary protocol violation ; v ) involuntary protocol violation . 3.5.6 Laboratory procedure evaluation Microscopy : three slide ( thin &amp; thick thin film ) obtain screen . One slide stain rapidly ( 10 % Giemsa 15min ) initial screening . Once patient enrol , two slide stain carefully ( 3 % Giemsa 45min ) . Parasite density determine count number asexual parasite per 200 white blood cell ( WBCs ) hand tally counter . If 500 parasite count reach 200 WBCs , count stop completion field . Density , express number asexual parasite per µl blood , calculate divide number asexual parasites number WBCs count correct estimate WBCs density ( typically 8000 per µl ) . When number asexual parasites less 10 per 200 white blood cell follow-up smear , count do least 500 white blood cell . A blood slide consider negative examination 1000 white blood cell reveal asexual parasite . Gametocyte density compute count number gametocyte per 500 WBCs . Haemoglobin ( Hb ) concentration measure whole blood collect micro-cuvette use Hemocue follow manufacturer instruction . P. falciparum molecular detection : DNA extract finger-prick blood sample collect microtainers . Molecular confirmation Plasmodium specie ( P.vivax , P.falciparum , P.ovale P.malariae ) Day 0 perform qPCR target 18S ribosomal gene . The qPCR method use identify quantify P. falciparum infection Day 0 follow sample . P. falciparum genotyping recrudescence/new infection : genotyping recurrent infection do characterize MSP1 , MSP2 GLURP , single-copy gene Plasmodium falciparum genome described elsewhere . RNA extraction RT-qPCR gametocyte : RNA extract RNAprotect sample use affinity column DNAse digestion genomic DNA . To detect quantify P. falciparum gametocyte stage reverse transcription qPCR ( RT-qPCR ) target Pfs25 gene transcript do Day 0 follow-up sample , follow previously describe protocols modification . Ex vivo drug sensitivity assay : venous blood collect EDTA/ACD tube ( Day 0 Day recurrence ) process within 6 hour collection . Blood centrifuge plasma buffy coat remove stored -20ºC . Red blood cell wash twice RPMI resuspend culture medium ( RPMI 1640 LPLF liquid medium ) 50 % hematocrite blood medium mixture ( BMM ) . Standard ex vivo drug sensitivity assay : assessment follow WHO guideline `` Field application vitro assay sensitivity human malaria parasites antimalarial drug '' assessment response P. falciparum artemisinins '' . Ex vivo ring stage survival assay ( RSA ) In addition standard ex vivo assay , performance ring stage survival assay ( RSA ) explore follow publish protocol . Molecular marker artemisinin resistance : extract DNA use genotype point mutation P. falciparum Kelch propeller domain ( K13 ) , recently identify candidate resistance molecular marker artemisinin resistance . Briefly , K13 amplify nested PCR use primer describe WWARN procedure INV11 [ http : //www.wwarn.org/toolkit/procedures ] . After agarose gel electrophoresis confirmation , product sequence analysed identify polymorphism . Alternative upcoming candidate artemisinin resistance may also explore 4 . QUALITY ASSURANCE Site monitor visit schedule regular basis . During visit , information record case report form ( CRFs ) verify source document ( eg laboratory record clinic register ) . After CRFs form collate end trial , review completeness accuracy . The data double enter site electronic database ( Epi Info ) , specially design computer check use identify data entry discrepancy , invalid data range overall consistency . All discrepancy resolve reference original check data collection form . All blood film admission read study site well senior microscopist coordinate centre . In addition , external quality control do ITM 10 % randomly select slide . For molecular assay ( qPCR , RT-qPCR parasite genotyping ) 10 % sample process NIMPE randomly choose re-analysed ITM . External quality control ex vivo drug assay result do ITM slide re-examined 10 % randomly choose isolates . 5 . Statistical Analysis Plan The parasite clearance time define elapsed time ( hour ) patient 's treatment ( first dose ) time first two consecutive negative blood slide . Parasite clearance time rate well lag phase fit use PCE online tool develop WWARN . The analysis 42 day cure rate perform modify intention-to-treat ( mITT ) patient population ( randomised patient ) evaluable patient population ( Per Protocol ) . Patients evaluable analysis 28/42 day cure rate parasite count record Day 26/40 patient discontinues due `` Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect '' reappearance parasite . The mITT analysis also include patient discontinue Day 28/42 due reason `` Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect '' ( e.g . could include `` Adverse experience ( ) '' repeat vomit ) . These patient count mITT analysis treatment failure regardless reason discontinuation . Patients concomitant treatment antibiotic anti malarial effect exclude evaluable patient include mITT . For categorical variable percentage correspond 95 % confidence interval calculate use Wilson 's method . Proportions compare calculate *2 Yates ' correction Fisher 's exact test appropriate . Normally distribute continuous data summarize mean standard deviation , compare Student 's test analysis variance . Data conform normal distribution summarize median ( IQR ) geometric mean compare Mann-Whitney U test Kruskal-Wallis analysis variance . The association 2 continuous variable assess use Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient . The risk treatment failure day28 42 evaluated survival analysis cumulative incidence calculate Kaplan Meier method compare Mantel-Haenszel log rank test . Parasite , fever gametocyte clearance time also evaluate Kaplan Meier method . Hematological change first week treatment well recovery weekly follow-up evaluate measuring change Hb concentration day0 , 3 , 7 , day14 , 28 42 , respectively . 6 .
