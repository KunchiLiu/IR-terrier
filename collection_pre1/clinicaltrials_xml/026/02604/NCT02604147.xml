	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training Wheelchair Basketball Players</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The respiratory system tout limit factor physical performance high intense physical exercise . This limitation relate , among thing , fatigue respiratory muscle . The fatigue muscle physical exercise generate many physiological reflex activation culminate reduce blood flow limb muscle , result decrease muscle performance . Researchers show inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) able generate improve athlete 's physical performance . However , come wheelchair athlete still divergent view effect IMT physical performance . Thus , study aim evaluate effect IMT physical performance cardiorespiratory variable wheelchair basketball player . For purpose , investigator select 40 wheelchair basketball player gender . The participant allocate blindly randomly two group differ propose intervention . In IMT Group , participant submit IMT program inicial load 50 % maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) ; SHAM Group submit simulated IMT load 15 % MIP . All participant pass evaluation procedure intervention , investagators evaluate benefit generate IMT physical performance cardiorespiratory variable wheelchair basketball player .</detailed_description>
