	<brief_summary>A two-arm ( two cycle ' versus four cycle ' capecitabine combine oxaliplatin concurrent radiotherapy ) randomise Phase III clinical trial start Oct. 2015 . Definitive chemoradiotherapy standard regimen Western country patient esophageal cancer ca n't receive surgery reject surgery . But China severer toxic reaction , patient discontinue treatment halfway way . Thus , chemotherapy regimen capecitabine combine oxaliplatin widely use clinical due characristic low toxic reaction . The purpose study confirm efficacy safety different cycle ( two cycle four cycle ) Capecitabine-oxaliplatin Chinese esophageal squamous carcinoma radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy . A total 60 patient accrue China within 2 year . The primary endpoint overall survival secondary endpoint include progression-free survival , response rate , pathologic complete response rate adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Different Cycles Chemotherapy（Capecitabine-oxaliplatin） Esophageal Chemoradiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First : The investigator use excel generate 5 digit random number table . After subject sign inform consent , investigator choose one themm . Subject get odd number receive 2cycles ' chemotheapy concurrent radiotherapy even number receive 4cycles ' . Investigators record congruent relationship subject group code . Second : The investigator require record subject ' base measurement . The base measurements items:1.Tumor confirm date , TNM staging , History esophageal cancer treatment ; 2.Demographic data , past medical history ; 3.physical examination ( detailed system check include general neurological examination ) ; 4.vital sign , Height , Weight ; 5.PS score , Quality life ; 6.serum biochemistry ( ALT , AST , AKP , TBIL , blood glucose , BUN , Ccr , electrolyte , et al. ) ; 7 . Blood RT ( RBC , HGB , WBC , ANC , PLT , et al . ) ; 8.Urine routine ; 9.Endoscopic biopsy ( More 3 piece biopsy specimen ) , chest CT , abdomen ultrasound/CT/MRI , PET-CT , et al . ; 10.Blood/urine pregnancy test ; 11.Collect blood sample ( 5 ml ) ; 12.Preserve CorpseSample . note : Check time limit-2 week get group . Third : Observation item treatment include 3-8 item base measurement ; Radiotherapy 20 time , review esophageal barium meal chest CT . The investigator need observe adverse event treatment eveluate relationship adverse event research therapeutic regimen accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , CTCAE ) ( V4.0 , 2009-05-28 ) accurately fill Case Report Form ( CRF ) . Fourth : Follow-up item include 3-9 item base measurement ; bood tissue sample also preserve subject receives 16th week ' review . The patient withdraw study research treatment must accept end evaluation research . The investigator must record reason date termination patient ' progress note CRF . Cases complete report transfer data administrator investigate clinical research associate . Data administrator input management data .</detailed_description>
