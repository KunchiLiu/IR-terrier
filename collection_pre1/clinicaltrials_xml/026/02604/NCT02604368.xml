	<brief_title>Sickle Cell Omega-3 Treatment Trial ( SCOT Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) inherit blood disease affect million people worldwide 100,000 Americans . Sickle cell disease group blood disorder affect hemoglobin ( Hb ) , molecule delivers oxygen throughout body via red blood cell . The abnormal sickle cell Hb polymerize low oxygen tension cause RBCs become distort rigid sickle , crescent shape . Sickle cell shorter lifespan normal RBCs . As result , patient SCD frequently develop anemia , lead fatigue , weakness , shortness breath , dizziness , headache , coldness hand foot . In child SCD , anemia also cause delayed growth development . Sickle red blood cell also prone adhesive interaction , white blood cell , platelet , blood vessel wall . These adhesive interaction lead occlusion small blood vessel , block flow blood , cause inflammation multiple organ damage . Acute blockage blood vessel result episodic event know sickle cell crisis , accompany 3 serious symptom : pain , organ damage inflammation . Pharmacotherapy SCD limit hydroxyurea , FDA approve drug treatment sickle cell disease . However , considerable percentage patient sickle disease responsive show vary degree response hydroxyurea treatment . For long time , investigator understand underlining pathological process lead occlusion blood vessel dominate simplistic mechanical approach . However , emerge evidence indicate primary event vaso-occlusion trigger polymerization-independent event , sickling occur secondary incident . The current consensus , primary event crucial vaso-occlusion due inflammation increase adhesion RBC , platelet leukocyte blood vessel line tissue ( endothelium ) . This new paradigm pathophysiology disease shift management strategy prevention Hb polymerization amelioration inflammation reduction blood cell adhesion . In order elucidate change behind increased propensity blood cell adhere endothelium extensive study conduct red blood cell membrane . The major membrane abnormality observe red blood cell SCD patient compromise membrane transport defect , dysfunctional lipid bilayer perturbation fatty acid composition membrane phospholipid . The abnormality characterize high omega-6 , low omega-3 imbalance two fatty acid family . The fatty acid imbalance SCD know contributory factor enhance blood cell adhesion , aggregation , blood coagulation inflammation ( Daak et al 2013 ; Daak et al 2015 ) . SC411 drug base omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) may help prevent sickle cell crisis , decrease inflammation continuous breakdown red blood cell . The active ingredient DHA , formulate use advanced Lipid Technologies™ ( ALT™ ) , encapsulate soft gelatin capsule . In study investigator compare rate sickle cell crises individual sickle cell anemia disease receive SC411 capsule vs. placebo capsule . The result research provide evidence potential therapeutic effect SC411 SCD .</detailed_description>
