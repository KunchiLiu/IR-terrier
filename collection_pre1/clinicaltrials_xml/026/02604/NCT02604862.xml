	<brief_summary>While process fibrosis essential normal wound healing , excessive uncontrolled 'fibrotic ' response result impaired tissue structure function . In word , affect 'fibrotic ' tissue unable heal back normal therefore n't work effectively normally would . In case lung , fibrosis occur across large part lung condition like Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) sarcoidosis occur much small patch around border lung tumour . At moment investigator n't fully understand mechanism fibrosis therefore monitor treat condition effectively investigator could . Despite significant global financial burden disease , treatment option limit monitor disease progression remain real challenge . In effort address problem , research team design synthesise image agent ( FIB ONE ) detect fibrosis lung . FIB ONE use low concentration patient lung condition characterise excessive activity fibroproliferative pathway either scheduled routine bronchoscopy elective surgery . FIB ONE administer directly lung bronchoscopy procedure image lung analyse . As part study , research team 's novel endomicroscopy detection system compare equipment routinely use NHS image FIB ONE probe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging FIB ONE Human Lung Using Endomicroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study deliver FIB ONE microdose 18 patient lung condition characterise excessive activity fibroproliferative pathway ( e.g . condition IPF , hypersensitivity pneumonitis , sarcoidosis , suspect confirmed lung cancer ) ass whether image agent detect fibrotic ( matrix metalloproteinases ) activity lung . The primary endpoint visualise delivery microdose FIB ONE ass image parameter patient lung condition use two microendoscopy system . Cohort 1 consist 12 patient schedule routine elective diagnostic surveillance bronchoscopy fibroproliferative lung condition Cohort 2 consist 6 patient undergoing planned cardiothoracic surgery biopsy/resection lung condition characterise excessive activity fibroproliferative pathway . For cohort , eligibility verify clinical trial physician write informed consent obtain . For cohort 1 , bronchoscopy lavage perform harvest broncho-alveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) . For cohort 2 , sample resect lung tissue analyse . Fibre-based endomicroscopy ( FE ) perform 70μg ( ± 40 % ) total FIB ONE instill . CT identify region architecturally normal lung participant act internal control use compare FIB ONE signal normal diseased lung tissue . Participants ask provide routine blood sample FIB ONE administration . A cardiorespiratory exam routine observation perform 4-6 hour follow administration FIB ONE participant assess discharge . All participant either contacted member research team via telephone ward visit 24 hour ( ± 4 hour ) FIB ONE dosing ensure AEs/SAEs experienced . The participant 's involvement study conclude 24 hour assessment successfully complete AEs/SAEs resolve .</detailed_description>
