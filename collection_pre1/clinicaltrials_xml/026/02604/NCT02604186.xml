	<detailed_description>Introduction Hereditary spastic paraplegia ( SPG ) constitute heterogeneous group diseases common predominant feature : spasticity lower limb difficulty walk . The neurologic examination reveals spasticity , exaggerated pathological reflex , Babinski sign , minor hypoesthesia . Spasticity evident patient walk passive movement . Weakness may may present , typically less disabling spasticity , especially initial year disease . The increase tonus lead reduce amplitude movement abnormal posture , altogether lead slow gait , fall articular deformity . Clinically , SPG divide pure complicate form . The first one characterize almost exclusive dysfunction pyramidal tract . Minor sensory sphincter disturbance also present . The complicated subtypes encompass wide variety associate feature ataxia , cognitive decline vision loss . Genetically , SPGs divide autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive X-linked form . Pure form mostly inherit autosomal dominant manner , whereas autosomal recessive form mostly manifest complicate form . Although useful clinically , genotype-phenotype correlation always true . The used SPG classification base locus harbor mutate gene . Each subtype designate initial SPG , follow number corresponds specific gene . The gene number establish follow chronological order identification locus . The discovery new gene unravel molecular pathway SPGs lead well understanding disease past year . Despite , treatment option . There placebo-controlled clinical trial perform assess therapeutic intervention SPG . Oral anti-spastic agent baclofen tizanidine frequently employ . When response inadequate , significant side effect , botulinum toxin injection may attempt . The substance block liberation acetylcholine pre-synaptic cleft . With less activation nicotinic receptor post-synaptic junction muscle contraction inhibit . Botulinum Toxin ( Btx ) first-line treatment movement disorder cervical dystonia , blepharospasm , spastic arm follow stroke . Studies Btx patient SPG limit small open-label case series , solid evidence patient actually benefit therapy . The rationale basis use base well establish knowledge Btx reduce muscle tonus . The functional impact gait , hand , well know , well impact treatment could produce symptom fatigue pain . Justification Spasticity disable manifestation patient SPG . Although recent advance genetic pathogenic characterization disease , scarcity therapeutic option . The use oral anti-spastics limited frequent side effect somnolence drowsiness . Therefore , investigator design randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover trial evaluate efficacy safety Btx injection patient SPG . The primary outcome measure gait velocity assess 10 meter walk test 8 week injection . Each participant submit one injection session Btx one placebo ( consist sterile sodium chloride ) , one separate period 6 month . Objectives General Objective To evaluate effect Btx compare placebo injection cohort patient SPG . The primary outcome increase gait velocity , measure reflect functional gain . Secondary outcome include measure spasticity , pain fatigue . Specific Objectives - To investigate whether Btx injection improve maximum gait velocity patient SPG compare injection placebo . - To investigate effect treatment versus placebo follow functional measure : Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale ( SPRS ) , Visual Analogic Pain Scale , Brief Pain inventory , Modified fatigue impact scale , Ashworth Spasticity muscle strength ( Medical Research Council Scale ) adductor triceps surae muscle . Methods Patients Selection Patients select regular consultation two University Hospitals Brazil : University Campinas ( UNICAMP ) Federal University Paran√° ( UFPR ) . Sample size Estimate The sample size calculus base recent exploratory study ( Niet , 2015 ) 15 patient autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia submit Btx injection triceps surae . This provoked increase gait velocity 9 % 4 week 12 % 18 week . Estimating 12 % effect alfa value 0.08 p value 0.05 , investigator obtain N 54 individual correct possible loss ( approximately 10 % ) . The Stata version 13.1 use estimate . Procedures All patient recruit randomized receive injection Prosigne ( Botulinum Toxin A ) Placebo solution ( sterile Sodium Chloride 0.9 % ) . Each patient treatment group receive 400 unit botulinum toxin . 100 unit inject adductor leg 100 unit apply triceps surae bilaterally . The botulinum toxin well placebo solution prepare blind investigator . Prosigne dilute sterile sodium chloride ( 10U/0.2mL ) . Within 24 28 week first treatment group switch . Those patient receive botulinum toxin receive placebo solution vice-versa ( crossover point ) . During study , patient orient maintain ongoing use medication . They receive explanatory sheet regard stretch exercise , least one month receive treatment , trained physiotherapist execute exercise twice week . Data analysis interpretation Patients evaluate experienced blind neurologist regard efficacy parameter study . This evaluation take place immediately treatment section 8 week . The primary outcome measure maximum gait velocity . Each patient ask walk 10 meter distance barefooted 3 time , fast . The average velocity 3 trial use final measure . Assistive device permit . Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale ( SPRS ) , Ashworth modify spasticity scale , medical research council scale muscular strength ( adductor , thigh triceps surae muscle group ) , visual analogic scale pain , brief pain inventory modify fatigue impact scale , together 10 meter comfortable walk velocity , evaluate day primary outcome measure serve secondary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
