	<brief_title>Reducing Risks Improving Glucose Control During Extended Exercise Youth With T1DM : The AP Ski Camp</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The object study evaluate Closed-Loop Control ( CLC ) environment muscle glycogen systematically deplete , glucose uptake systematically increase , meal size naturally large normal : week camp high altitude , concomitant variable oxygen consumption environment involve ; winter , expose challenge different component system cold temperature , twice daily practice physical activity design deplete glycogen reserve ski . This proposal aim demonstrate superiority CLC , also know Artificial Pancreas ( AP ) , compare state-of-the art system available market : Sensor-augmented pump ( SAP ) . This system show diminish hypoglycemic event set alarm continue glucose monitor ( CGM ) take action , perform self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) treat confirm low .</detailed_description>
