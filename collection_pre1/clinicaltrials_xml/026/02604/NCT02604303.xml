	<brief_summary>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) disease abnormal bulge main abdominal artery , call abdominal aorta . The purpose observational study identify whether blood biomarker protein RhoA predict small AAA patient may need surgery future . Participating patient receive ultrasound blood draw . The patient divide expand stable aorta group determine patient 's aortic expansion rate . The blood RhoA level aortic expansion rate group would compare look relationship .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) asymptomatic problem rupture occur , cause excruciate pain sudden death . It diagnose typically ultrasound aortic diameter ≥ 3.0 cm aortic diameter ≥ 5.5 cm generally require surgical repair prevent rupture . A normal aorta 2.0 cm diameter . For patient small AAA ( 3.0-5.4 cm ) serial image study recommend along risk factor modification . However , follow ultrasound protocol difficult follow , result many patient expand AAA detect late . To streamline good identify patient small AAAs risk expansion , investigator look RhoA possible biomarker . The investigator recruit within 2-year period total 200 subject diagnose small AAA 3.0-5.4 cm diameter VA Northern California Health Care System . All subject enrol already baseline aortic diameter establish time initial AAA screening diagnostic imaging . The investigator expect follow ultrasound measurement study least 1 5 year baseline ultrasound study . The follow evaluation ass expansion rate aorta . Stable aorta subject expansion rate le 0.2 cm/year expand aorta subject expansion rate ≥ 0.2 cm/year base preliminary data . After ultrasound , 30 ml blood drawn heparinized tube undergo blood analysis RhoA protein monocyte . All patient notify possible need return back either clinical reason : AAA great 5.5 cm research protocol reason : inadequate monocyte collection change clinical data requirement . Cardiovascular risk factor also collect . All collect data stable expand AAA group compare analysis . If biological clinical risk factor identify reliable biomarkers AAA expansion , AAA screen program could modify increase screen yield improve surveillance small AAAs . Additionally , novel diagnostic technique could develop good identify small AAA patient risk surgery .</detailed_description>
