	<brief_title>Degenerative Mitral Regurgitation Intermediate Risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe mitral regurgitation associate significant morbidity mortality . Mitral valve surgical repair proven effective durable option treatment symptomatic degenerative mitral regurgitation ( MR ) . Echocardiography remain cornerstone evaluation patient degenerative ( Type II ) mitral regurgitation allow assessment mitral anatomy , quantification regurgitant severity , assessment biventricular function , non-invasive measurement pulmonary artery systolic pressure identify presence valvular disease . The AHA/ACC Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines recommend use exercise echocardiography set mitral regurgitation determine degree mitral regurgitation pulmonary artery systolic pressure pre post exercise addition objective determination symptom exercise capacity . Echocardiography ( rest exercise modality ) helpful post-mitral valve repair period assessment mitral valve gradient recurrent mitral regurgitation . Symptomatic MR patient poor health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) improve / return comparable age-adjusted norm reference population mitral valve repair replacement . To date , limited assessment degree mitral regurgitation , mitral stenosis , exercise capacity follow surgical percutaneous mitral valve intervention measure exercise echocardiography . We propose modality addition novel image technology provide robust avenue assessment patient longitudinally . Additionally , assessment HRQOL , include physical mental health domain , provide important information guide patient care mitral valve surgery .</detailed_description>
