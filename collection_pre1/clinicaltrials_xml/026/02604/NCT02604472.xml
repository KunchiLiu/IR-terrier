Follow-up data update October 1st , 2015.The propensity score-matching ( PSM ) method adopt balance observe covariates group . Propensity score reflect conditional probability intend uniform patient receive CCRT IC+CCRT base baseline characteristic . Matching perform base nearest-neighbor matching , compare CCRT IC+CCRT patient match within respective risk group .</detailed_description>
