	<detailed_description>Coronary obstruction occlusive thrombus complicate rupture eroded atherosclerotic plaque frequent pathologic substrate acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , , . Timely restoration perfusion thereby myocardial salvage single important objective management patient ST segment-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) prefer treatment STEMI patient effective open infarct-related artery ( IRA ) restore Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) III flow 95 % patient , , . However presence large thrombus burden increase incidence adverse outcome include persistent transient no-reflow in-hospital major adverse cardiac event ( MACEs ) , possibly due distal atherothrombotic embolization , ensue disruption microvascular network failure myocardial reperfusion . The microvascular obstruction occur 10 % STEMI patient patent epicardial vessel primary PCI , , . It associate increased infarct size , reduce recovery ventricular function , increased mortality , , , , , , . Removal thrombi IRA primary PCI may prevent distal embolization improve myocardial perfusion thus long term clinical outcome . However study conduct date provide mixed result , , , , , .The two large randomize trial date compare manual thrombus aspiration ( MTA ) follow PCI PCI Thrombus Aspiration PCI Acute Myocardial Infarction ( TASTE ) study , Thrombus Aspiration Percutaneous coronary intervention Acute myocardial infarction ( TAPAS ) study , . They illustrate exist uncertainty . TAPAS study show improvement myocardial blush grade ( primary endpoint ) reduction cardiac mortality one year follow patient MTA group compare conventional-PCI group . However , important note TAPAS power detect difference clinical outcome . TASTE study show mortality benefit MTA one year follow . These result conclude routine use thrombus aspiration support current evidence however , selective use may improve tissue perfusion patient .Accordingly MTA currently class IIb recommendation European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) guideline myocardial revascularization STEMI patient , class IIa recommendation 2013 ACC/AHA STEMI guideline . The latter release result TASTE publish . MTA ineffective â‰ˆ30 % patient . Furthermore , residual thrombus MTA present virtually patient study optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) .27 , . The currently exist alternative technique removal intracoronary thrombus Rheolytic Thrombectomy ( RT ) Angiojet device . RT catheter-based system utilizes multiple high-velocity , high-pressure saline jet introduce orifice distal tip catheter create localize low-pressure zone ( Venturi-Bernoulli effect ) , result vacuum effect entrainment dissociation bulky thrombus . The jet break thrombi small particle propel proximally exhaust lumen , lead aspiration removal thrombotic debris without embolization . The two large randomize trial date study benefit RT patient present acute STEMI ( JETSTENT ) Study ( AIMI ) study . In JETSTENT study8 , ST-segment resolution frequently achieve RT arm . There few MACEs ( death , MI , target vessel revascularization , stroke ) RT arm 12 month ( p=0.036 ) . Infarct size one month differ arm . However , result JETSTENT need interpret caution ; strict statistical sense , negative trial . Studies co-primary endpoint require p value 0.05 endpoint 0.025 single endpoint . This achieved JETSTENT . However , multivariable analysis show use rheolytic thrombectomy independently associate improved clinical outcome one year - acknowledging latter one primary endpoint . On hand , AIMI 24 , final infarct size high adjunct RT group compare PCI group . Final TIMI III flow low adjunct RT group . Thirty-day MACEs high adjunct RT group , difference primarily driven low mortality rate patient treat PCI . There significant difference TIMI blush grade ST-segment resolution group . However , several limitation AIMI ; ) study require angiographic evidence thrombus , fact , exclude patient large thrombus burden , b ) retrograde technique - involve cross lesion activation device - use majority patient RT group , c ) time delay admission use RT ( door-to-device ) long , ) compare RT group , patient PCI-only group baseline TIMI III flow ( 44 % vs. 63 % , p= 0.05 ) . Collectively , factor might overshadow potential benefit RT AIMI . In another study , Parodi et al 31 , compare MTA RT patient acute STEMI use residual thrombus burden ( assessed OCT ) primary endpoint . The study meet primary end point ; number OCT quadrant contain residual thrombus .However , angiographic thrombus grade decrease significantly RT , marker reperfusion ( secondary endpoint ) good RT arm . There trend toward high rate early ST-segment elevation resolution RT arm compare MTA arm . These finding suggest RT may effective MTA less degree hypothesize investigator . Furthermore , calculation thrombus volume OCT extremely challenge give inability accurately define border disrupt atherosclerotic plaque superimpose thrombus , blur optical shadowing red thrombus . To address uncertainty , study aim evaluate role RT patient likely benefit ( thrombus grade 4 5 ) use sensitive , quantitative , reproducible parameter ; CMR-derived myocardial salvage . CMR Cardiac MRI provide wide range information myocardial edema ( myocardium risk ) , microvascular obstruction ( MVO ) , location `` transmurality '' necrosis , well quantification infarct size . Moreover , CMR provide accurate reproducible measurement ventricular volume function . For reason , cardiac MRI currently perceive ideal tool evaluation global post-infarction remodeling . Myocardial edema acute phase myocardial infarction visualize bright signal T2-weighted image , define 'myocardium risk .The major advantage technique distinguish chronic acute infarction , quantify proportion myocardial salvage assess retrospectively compare T2-weighted edematous ( risk ) size late gadolimium enhancement ( LGE ) image ( scar ) . LGE image T1-weighted inversion recovery sequence acquire 10 min intravenous administration gadolinium inversion time choose null myocardial signal use 'inversion time scout ' 'look locker ' sequence . Delayed post-contrast sequence currently use also evaluate persistent microvascular dysfunction/damage : context white LGE region ( infarcted myocardium ) dark hypoenhanced area may coexist , traditionally refer microvascular obstruction . Microvascular obstruction initially define hypo enhancement 1-2 min gadolinium injection ; final infarct size depend mainly extent so-called 'risk area ' , define myocardial area relate occlude coronary artery complete absence blood flow , either antegrade collateral . These novel CMR-derived parameter emerge potential index adverse remodeling , attractive myocardial salvage . Myocardial salvage prognostically validate therapeutic target primary PCI , , , , myocardial salvage index strong predictor major cardiac event mortality 6-month . Myocardial salvage define difference initial jeopardized area risk ( determine T2-weighted MRI ) baseline final infarct size ( determine contrast-enhanced MRI ) . The myocardial salvage index define final infarct size indexed initial area risk , , . Objectives study : 1 . To determine whether Rheolytic Thrombectomy ( RT ) conventional PCI culprit vessel compare conventional PCI ( without MTA ) result improve myocardial salvage . 2 . To identify clinical angiographic determinant difference observe treatment group .</detailed_description>
