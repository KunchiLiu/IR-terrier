	<brief_summary>Paralympians compete wheelchair sport may experience high glycolytic demand ( therefore acidotic environment ) upper-body muscle , particularly high-intensity discipline . Previous study group show upper-body exercise sensitive ergogenic effect β-alanine supplementation nutritional supplement capable increase buffering capacity . In line , show upper-body muscle group benefit artificially induced alkalosis lower-body muscle group . Although β-alanine appear interesting potential ergogenic supplement paralympians , study date assess potential wheelchair athletes.In study , evaluate effect β-alanine supplementation upper-body performance wheelchair athlete .</brief_summary>
