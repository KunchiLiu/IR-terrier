	<brief_title>Detection Flap Ischemia Using Interstitial Glucose Monitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Breast reconstruction involve microvascular free tissue transfer major , labour-intensive operation provide numerous benefit patient ' psychosocial function well-being . Flap failure , though rare , devastate complication lead serious morbidity . It occur first 24-72 hour operation . However , ischemia detect earlier , chance operative salvage well . Unfortunately , current monitoring process remain mostly subjective . A simple device objectively assess flap perfusion - either stand-alone tool adjunct current monitoring method - would tremendous improvement detection early postoperative flap ischemia , turn , increase flap salvage survival . Purpose : The overall objective clinical pilot study examine accuracy reliability measure interstitial glucose level use Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM ) technology objective method detect postoperative flap tissue ischemia patient undergoing free flap-based reconstructive surgery . Methods : In pilot cohort study , investigator aim prospectively include 30 free flap total 10-20 patient undergo DIEP-based breast reconstruction one surgeon Juravinski Hospital . Patients recruit pre-operative consultation . The transcutaneous sensor CGM device insert subcutaneous layer flap upon completion surgery , additional sensor place patient 's thigh control . These device blind start record flap 's interstitial glucose level . The patient admit flap assess clinically per protocol . On-call resident give data collection sheet document exact time alert flap , clinical finding , subsequent decision make . Once endpoint reach flap , CGM sensor remove data extract . Data Analysis : The timing occurrence low interstitial glucose level rapid glucose level decline analyze time clinical concern raise flap . The systemic glucose level use control flap glucose level . The investigator aim analyze temporal correlation interstitial glucose measurement clinical finding flap 's vascular status ( eg . vessel occlusion , ischemia ) . Statistical analysis do assistance biostatistician .</detailed_description>
