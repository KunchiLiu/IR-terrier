	<brief_title>Granulomatous Mastitis Current Approach Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Granulomatous mastitis ( GM ) rare inflammatory disease breast generally affect young parous woman . It emphasize lactation use oral contraceptive consider among predispose factor disease . GM firstly identify 1972 , consider important disease great mimicker breast carcinoma . The form treatments involve corticosteroid , antibiotic general surgical resection include mastectomy . Furthermore , preferred form treatment define yet . Also , enough data show result use antibiotic . Since GM rare disease , common consensus diagnosis treatment GM . The uncertainty distinct diagnosis , determine form term treatment , order treatment necessary , well medical specialty need involve treatment process still remain . Therefore , uncertainty cause difficulty manage treatment process physician . Furthermore , since enough study GM limit case report present literature , success treatment process associate experience treatment center . Therefore , clear need multicentric study compare different approach treatment process enough number case . DATA COLLECTION In study , patient 's data retrospectively obtain record data patient ' file electronic record . The data include determined parameter study group GM data record excel file include specific column follow entry : patient ' age , diagnosis , secondary disease , diagnosis method , treatment , recurrence , risk factor may cause disease ( smoking , use oral contraceptive , breast infection etc. ) . A shared excel file follow website http : //sanko.edu.tr/GranulamatozMastit create record data simultaneously . Each researcher add data file use username password . After data collection , data present mean+StDv . Statistical analysis include Mann-Whitney U test , student 's test chi-square test statistical significance set P &lt; 0.05 . The treatment group study divide medical , surgical medical+surgical comparison among group conduct reach aim determine expect outcome section . The sample size power analysis conduct result indicate least 100 sample group require achieve statistical significance P &lt; 0.05 90 % power . The estimated total case expect 400 case . EXPECTED OUTCOMES 1 . Potential etiology investigate . 2 . The result shed light optimal management method patient GM . 3 . The treatment duration order reveal . 4 . Treatment management algorithm create . 5 . The hypothesis success ternary treatment approach test . 6 . Creation prognostic index GM try . 7 . Since multicentric study plan , experience result different center investigate . 8 . Since study multicentric enough number case , true statistical result obtain . 9 . Among medical specialty involve communication determination diagnosis treatment reveal .</detailed_description>
