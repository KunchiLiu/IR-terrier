	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile common cause healthcare-associated infectious diarrhea among adult industrialized country . In addition diarrhea , C. difficile infection ( CDI ) may also result serious complication shock , toxic megacolon , colectomy , death . The Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) estimate C. difficile result 250,000 hospital infection , 14,000 death , $ 1 billion excess cost annually . Recurrent CDI challenge clinical dilemma face clinician treat disease . An estimated 30 % patient respond initial treatment either vancomycin metronidazole develop recurrent CDI , usually within 1-4 week complete treatment . The primary objective study determine whether 1 ) standard fidaxomicin treatment 2 ) standard vancomycin treatment follow taper pulse vancomycin treatment superior standard vancomycin treatment alone sustain clinical response day 59 treatment , participant either first second recurrence CDI . Veterans present first second CDI recurrence screen , consent randomly assign double-blind manner one three treatment group : 1 ) 10 day course oral vancomycin ( VAN-TX ) , 2 ) 10 day course fidaxomicin ( FID-TX ) 3 ) 31 day course vancomycin include taper pulse follow daily treatment ( VAN-TP/P ) . Symptom resolution define improvement resolution diarrhea ( &lt; 3 unformed bowel movement 24 hour ) 48 consecutive hour compare participant 's baseline . Recurrence define diarrhea ( &gt; 3 loose semi-formed stool 24 hour 48 consecutive hour ) . A sample size 546 randomize study participant require obtain least 82 % power detect 16 % absolute difference ( expect proportion 31 % VAN-TX group ) sustain clinical response ( D- COM ) proportion 1 ) FID-TX group VAN-TX group 2 ) VAN-TP/P group VAN-TX group 0.05 significance level . The study expect complete enrollment 4 year 90 day follow-up . Twenty four site , include 6 pilot site , require enroll approximately 0.6 participant per month ( 7 every year ) , 21 participant per site ( 28 participant per pilot site ) 4 year ( 546 participant total ) . This assume 30 % Veterans CDI recurrence 20 % enroll study .</detailed_description>
