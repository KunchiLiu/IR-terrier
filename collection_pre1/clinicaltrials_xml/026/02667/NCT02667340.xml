	<brief_title>Superstarch Physical/Cognitive Performance Following Simulated Soccer Game</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind cross study . There two treatment involve : Superstarch glucose ( placebo ) . Participants investigator blind individual involved project prepare distribute treatment ( drink ) accord cod system keep confidential study complete . Participants complete treatment treatment order systematically rotate avoid order effect . Healthy men woman soccer player age 18-35 yr recruit . Participants come lab five different occasion complete two familiarization session , baseline test session , two main trial . During first visit , participant ask complete physical activity readiness questionnaire ( approve previously ; Par Q participant information form personal familial health history rule pathology health issue may preclude participate present study . Subsequently , investigator collect data VO2max , body composition sprint speed . In second visit , participant familiarize high intensity intermittent exercise protocol use study day also allow practice cognitive skill test use ( 8 time order remove learn effect may influence result ) . During third visit , baseline score skill test collect . Participants perform 4 attempt ( first two re-acclimation ) last two record . The remain two visit study day separate least 1 week . The order treatment randomize avoid order effect . The night study day , participant arrive laboratory 19:00 h feed standardized meal contain 2g/kg carbohydrate ( pasta tomato sauce ) allow food drink except water thereafter . On study day , participant arrive lab 07:30 h follow overnight 12h fast refrained exercise , caffeine alcohol within prior 24 hour . Baseline capillary blood lactate blood glucose obtain fingerprick trained phlebotomist . In order ensure prevention infection contamination sampling , standard sterile blood handle technique use include use new medical examination glove , alcohol swab , disposable sterile lancet . All blood-contaminated material dispose hazardous material label disposal ( sharp ) container , promptly analysis . Subsequently , baseline data cognitive test collect . After collect baseline data , correspond treatment give 30 minute , participant perform standardize 10-minute warm-up , follow exercise session . The exercise session consist 60- minute simulate soccer game divide 4 x 15-minute block exercise ( run ) vary intensity replicate activity pattern soccer sprinting , jogging , cruise , walk etc . The proportion time spend speed allocate base time-motion analysis professional soccer player observe Reilly Thomas ( 1976 ) indicate Clarke et al ( 2008 ) . During 15-minute block , cognitive function test use serial seven subtraction test Flanker test . Also , expire gas sample collect last 4 min standardize 15-minute block estimate carbohydrate fat oxidation . A fingerprick blood lactate blood glucose sample collect end 15-minute block . Ratings perceive exertion also take end block . Water available ad-libitum first test day quantify . The amount water provide remain trial . After completion 60-minute simulated soccer game , test physical performance use repeat sprint ability test comprise twelve , 30m sprint 35sec walk recovery sprint . Subsequently , technical skill assess use battery test comprise Slalom Dribble test Loughborough Soccer Passing Test ( LSPT ) . The Slalom Dribble test skill test require participant dribble soccer ball around set obstacle course take least amount time possible whereas LSPT test require participant accurately pass soccer ball set number time towards colour target negotiate coned area , quickly possible .</detailed_description>
