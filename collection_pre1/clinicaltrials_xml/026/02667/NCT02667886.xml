	<brief_title>Trial X4P-001 Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>X4P-001 orally bioavailable CXCR4 antagonist demonstrate activity various tumor model . CXCR4 ( C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 ) receptor CXCL12 ( C-X-C chemokine ligand type 12 ) . CXCL12 potent chemotactic activity lymphocytes MDSCs ( myeloid-derived suppressor cell ) , important home hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow . CXCR4 also express active multiple type human cancer , include ccRCC , ovarian cancer , melanoma , increased expression CXCR4 tumor cell associate significantly decrease overall patient survival . Multiple observation implicate CXCL12/CXCR4 axis contribute lack ( loss ) tumor responsiveness angiogenesis inhibitor ( also refer `` angiogenic escape '' ) . In animal cancer model , interference CXCR4 function demonstrate disrupt tumor microenvironment unmask tumor immune attack multiple mechanism , include : - Eliminating tumor re-vascularization - Decreasing infiltration MDSCs - Increasing ratio CD8+ T cell Treg cell The hypothesis effective CXCR4 antagonism X4P-001 would potential benefit patient advance ccRCC cancer multiple mechanism : - Decreased recruitment MDSCs , result increase anti-tumor immune attack - Sustained decrease neoangiogenesis tumor vascular supply - Interference autocrine effect increase expression ccRCC CXCR4 CXCL12 , ligand , thereby , potentially reduce cancer cell metastasis This initial clinical trial patient advance ccRCC evaluate X4P-001 single agent ( monotherapy ) also combination axitinib , small molecule TKI ( tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) approve second-line treatment patient ccRCC . This combination potential improve outcome reduce angiogenic escape typically occur TKI therapy .</detailed_description>
