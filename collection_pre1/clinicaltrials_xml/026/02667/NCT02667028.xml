	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) major concern public health China . Relatively limited information available evidence-based therapy incorporate appropriately routine clinical practice . In addition , little information available practical apply knowledge large unselected population use guide practice quality improvement . To investigate treatment pattern outcome PCI real-world clinical setting , 3007 consecutive PCI case select January 1 , 2010 October 31 , 2014 , large-scale hospital Northeast China.At first , investigator identify PCI patient PACS ( Picture Archiving Communication Systems ) interventional imaging data January 1 , 2010 October 31 , 2014 assign case unique study ID . Then , investigator abstract comprehensive clinical data procedural data . Comprehensive clinical data come electronic medical record , include patient demographic characteristic , past cardiac noncardiac history , patient clinical characteristic hospital admission , laboratory measurement , procedure-related complication use cardiac medication index hospitalization discharge . CAG image review 2 cardiologist PACS . Other Procedural data , include stent type , total stent length , come operation record PCI case finish operator . The first clinical follow-up assess October 2015 direct hospital visit phone interview patient 's general practitioner/cardiologist , patient , family case . A secondary clinical follow-up assess individually three-year-follow-up patient available . A third clinical follow-up assess individually five-year-follow-up patient available . All event obtain patient ' medical record . If data unavailable , status ascertain telephone call patient 's refer hospital physician . All event adjudicate classified 2 cardiologist . By characterize difference patient ' feature , compare use medication procedure , examine outcome , 'll define gap clinical practice guideline evaluate treatment pattern outcome . New knowledge generate PCI management provide evidence clinical guideline , improve patient prognosis future finally .</detailed_description>
