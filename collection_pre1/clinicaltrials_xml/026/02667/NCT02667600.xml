	<brief_title>Blood Loss Measurement During Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study . Potential participant approach member research team prior surgery . Healthy ASA 1 , 2 , 3 patient undergoing uncomplicated Cesarean delivery recruit . The Triton device use surgery estimate blood loss . Specifically , device take picture blood saturate lap fluid collection canister calculate hemoglobin loss overall blood loss . Serum hemoglobin sample collect baseline presentation pre-operative area , within 15 min arrival PACU 24 hr post cesarean delivery . Blood sample take place venipuncture technique vein arm . Maternal vital sign perioperative period ( heart rate , maternal mean arterial blood pressure , anesthetic technique , fluid administration , surgical data record . All patient neuraxial anesthetic spinal combine spinal/epidural . Fluid administration discretion anesthesiologist follow standard guideline include 1L Lactated Ringers co-load time spinal 1-2L crystaloid intraoperatively . At end cesarean section , follow measurement make : 1. tEBL : Triton device use measure blood loss wet dry soak laps suction canister . These measurement use calculate tEBL . 2. vEBL : The attend obstetrician anesthesiologist independently ask provide estimate total blood loss ( vEBL ) . We use value separate regression analyse 3. qEBL : Blood loss measure cumulative measurement follow : volume blood suction chamber end surgery ( subtract estimate amniotic fluid suction chamber ; weight blood soaked lap ; estimate spillage blood ( ml ) around surgical field ( collected lap suction chamber ) . Using mixed effect model , determine whether estimate blood loss measurement use Triton ( tEBL ) use predict postpartum hemoglobin ( Hb ) level , account predelivery Hb level , intraoperative intravenous fluid patient/operative factor .</detailed_description>
