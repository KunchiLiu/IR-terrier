	<detailed_description>As part series post-marketing requirement ( PMR ) study extended-release ( ER ) long-acting ( LA ) opioid analgesic , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) require New Drug Application ( NDA ) holder ER/LA opioids conduct study estimate incidence misuse , abuse , addiction , overdose , death among patient chronic pain use long-term opioid therapy , validate measure use estimate incidence adverse event . The purpose study validate measurement opioid overdose event use diagnostic code data extract note write electronic medical record ( EMR ) , accompany diagnostic algorithm , use study incidence predictor opioid overdose death ( PMR Study 1B ) among patient prescribe opioid analgesic . Diagnostic code , accompany diagnostic algorithm , compare manually abstract medical chart review . Code-based algorithms useful identify opioid overdose claims-based system include cod data also find applicability system EMRs . Code-based algorithm improve text search EMR clinical notation use Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) identify overdose event identify diagnostic code differentiate intentional unintentional overdoses . Yield result EMR-based algorithm compare manually abstract medical chart review . This EMR-based algorithm useful identify opioid overdoses system EMRs , differentiate cause different type overdoses . For example , overdose event due misuse ( e.g. , therapeutic use indicate clinician ) , medication error patient , medical error make prescribers , abuse patient , abuse non-patients feign patient order receive medication ; suicide . Overdose event therefore differ intentionality , whether person attempt suicide . Unintentional overdoses occur result various cause , include misuse ( therapeutic use consistent clinician order ) , abuse , adverse reaction medication , anesthesia , medication errorsâ€”both patient provider-based . In addition , distinction unintentional intentional overdoses sometimes unclear . This validation study attempt differentiate overdose intentionality use code-based algorithms NLP-enhanced algorithm . Currently , administrative database use ICD-9 code nonfatal diagnosis ICD-10 code fatal event . In October 2015 , ICD-10 code schedule replace ICD-9 code nonfatal diagnosis administrative database . This study validate exist ICD-9 code study meet FDA-required timeline final report November 2015 . This study evaluate misuse since capture instrument prospective study patient chronic pain ( PMR Study 1A ) use combination adapt validated instrument , new instrument evaluate PMR Study 2 . This study include formal validation opioid-related death , since process cod death vary state state , include verification opioid-related death relative medical record event available state national death data ( 12-month 2-year lag state death record ) .</detailed_description>
