	<brief_title>Distal Renal Denervation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent spectacular failure renal denervation ( RDN ) therapy SymplicityHTN-3 trial fact might easily predict beginning . Conventional RDN do 4-6 point treatment equally distribute within main trunk renal artery ( RA ) may effective renal plexus tightly surround artery throughout whole course equal longitudinal circumferential density nerve fiber . While idea unnaturally idealistic also number surgical study demonstrate proximally majority renal nerve go distance RA obliquely course join artery mainly distal part ( fan-shaped renal plexus wide base direct toward aorta apex converge renal gate ) . We develop distal mode RDN target segmental branch RA conduct single-center double-blind randomize controlled parallel group study compare efficacy safety conventional RDN patient drug-resistant hypertension .</detailed_description>
