	<brief_title>Correlation Between Acute Analgesia Long-Term Function Following Ankle Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Ankle sprain occur frequently Canadian Armed Forces ( CAF ) population account significant proportion lose work time . Equally significant use analgesic ( NSAID non-NSAID ) ( NSAID = non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) CAF population . Existing literature suggest rate extent soft tissue healing may adversely affect use analgesic , particularly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent ( NSAIDs ) , use immediately follow joint injury . There two postulate mechanism observation : first inflammatory marker require regeneration process ; second diminish pain level result analgesic use encourages overuse injured tissue . Unfortunately , science far conclusive , since much derive base isolated exercise , conduct experimental setting , old population , extrapolate biomarkers validate clinical relevance . While current standard practice regard use pain reliever follow ankle injury , practice continue widespread CAF . Goal The propose study aim clarify whether three commonly use non-opioid pain reliever provide additional benefit delay improvement ankle function follow mild ankle sprain , compare standardized physiotherapy treatment alone . The three agent investigate 1 ) non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug naproxen , 2 ) selective anti-inflammatory celecoxib , 3 ) centrally-acting analgesic acetaminophen . Methods Patients present health clinic Garrison Petawawa acute ankle injury screen study eligibility . All individual elect participate study refer standardized physiotherapy treatment , administer accord study protocol . Participants also randomize one four analgesic treatment group ( i.e. , naproxen , celecoxib , acetaminophen , non-pharmacological measure ) , stratification grade ankle injury . Physiotherapists blind analgesic treatment allocation evaluate participant ' ankle function 72 hour , 2 week , 3 month 1 year post-injury , use previously validate test . Pharmacists assess response drug therapy , side effect , use rescue medication day 7 follow enrollment . Occurrence repeat ankle injuries health resource consumption ( i.e. , specialist visit diagnostic imaging ) also assess year follow index injury . Risks This study intend low risk participant design closely mirror exist practice injury . All medication use study indicated soft tissue injury respective dosages/frequencies/durations align manufacturer recommendation . The physiotherapy intervention develop Dr. Eric Robitaille . It use previous study currently use CAF . The investigator expect risk injury higher associated exist practice ankle injury . Benefits Participants expect benefit direct application standardize physiotherapy treatment protocol overall management condition well pain relief analgesic option . The result study expect generate new information readily apply patient care , specifically treat frequently-occurring soft tissue injury CAF population .</detailed_description>
