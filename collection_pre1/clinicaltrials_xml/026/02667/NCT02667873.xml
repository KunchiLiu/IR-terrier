	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Trial Novel XPO1 Inhibitor Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study SL-801-0115 first-in-human , dose-escalation study patient advance ( i.e. , metastatic locally advanced unresectable ) solid tumor resistant relapse follow available standard systemic therapy standard systemic therapy additional radiation therapy loco-regional therapy consider feasible . Eligible patient enrol receive treatment SL-801 21-day cycle . SL-801 administer orally dose regimen depend cohort patient enrol . The study plan enroll 40-50 adult patient multiple study center US .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The patient must histologic cytologic evidence malignant solid tumor must disease resistant relapse follow available standard systemic therapy , standard systemic therapy reasonable therapy likely result clinical benefit . The patient must advance disease , define cancer either metastatic , OR locally advance unresectable ( additional radiation therapy locoregional therapy consider feasible ) . The patient must disease measurable standard image technique , per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors , version 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ) , evaluable per RECIST 1.1 . ( For patient prior radiation therapy , measurable lesion must outside prior radiation field [ ] , unless disease progression document disease site subsequent radiation . ) The patient ≥18 year old . The patient ECOG PS 02 . The patient adequate baseline organ function , demonstrate following : Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min . Serum albumin ≥2.5 g/dL . Bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional ULN . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤2.5 × institutional ULN ( patient hepatic metastasis must AST/ALT ≤5 time ULN ) . International normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤1.5 prothrombin time ( PT ) ≤1.5 × ULN ; either partial thromboplastin time activate partial thromboplastin time ( PTT aPTT ) ≤1.5 × ULN . The patient adequate baseline hematologic function , demonstrate following : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5×10⁹/L Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL , red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion within prior 14 day . Platelet count ≥100×10⁹/L , platelet transfusion within prior 14 day . If patient woman child bear potential ( WOCBP ) , negative serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior treatment . The patient ( male female ) agree use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study , continue use acceptable contraceptive method 1 month last dose SL801 . The patient sign informed consent prior initiation studyspecific procedure treatment . The patient able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement , include followup survival assessment . The patient persistent clinically significant ≥Grade 2 toxicity previous anticancer therapy ( exclude Grade 2 chemotherapyrelated neuropathy permit , exclude Grade 23 laboratory abnormality associate symptom , consider clinically significant Investigator , manage available medical therapy ) . The patient receive treatment chemotherapy , externalbeam radiation , systemic anticancer therapy within 14 day prior C1D1 ( 28 day prior nitrosourea mitomycinC ) . ( Patients advanced prostate cancer receive luteinizing hormone release hormone [ LHRH ] agonist permit onto study continue use agent study treatment ) . The patient receive treatment investigational systemic anticancer agent within 14 day prior C1D1 . The patient previously receive treatment SL801 another investigational agent inhibits XPO1/CRM1 pathway . The patient additional active malignancy may confound assessment study endpoint . Patients past cancer history ( active malignancy within 2 year prior study entry ) substantial potential recurrence must discuss Sponsor study entry . Patients follow concomitant neoplastic diagnosis eligible : nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ ( include transitional cell carcinoma , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ) , organconfined prostate cancer evidence progressive disease . The patient clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( e.g. , uncontrolled New York Heart Association Class 3 4 congestive heart failure [ Appendix 1 ] , uncontrolled angina , history myocardial infarction , unstable angina stroke within 6 month prior study entry , uncontrolled hypertension clinically significant arrhythmia control medication ) . The patient uncontrolled , clinically significant pulmonary disease ( e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary hypertension ) , Investigator 's opinion , would put patient significant risk pulmonary complication study . The patient know active suspect brain leptomeningeal metastasis . ( Central nervous system [ CNS ] imaging require prior study entry unless clinical suspicion CNS involvement ) . Patients stable , treated brain metastasis eligible provide evidence CNS disease growth image least 3 month follow radiation therapy locoregional ablative therapy CNS . The patient receive immunosuppressive therapy prophylaxis follow prior organ transplant ( solid organ allogeneic stem cell ) . Lowdose corticosteroid therapy permit . The patient uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , uncontrolled infection , disseminate intravascular coagulation , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . The patient pregnant breast feeding . The patient know positive status human immunodeficiency virus active chronic Hepatitis B Hepatitis C. The patient oxygendependent . The patient medical condition opinion Investigator place patient unacceptably high risk toxicity .</criteria>
