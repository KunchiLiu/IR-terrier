	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) debilitate illness affect million individual North America result clinical symptom include loss pleasure feeling worthlessness , addition significant cognitive impairment ( e.g. , memory , attention ) affect daily functioning . Major depression bear heavy burden individual family member afflict , well enormous health care economic cost . Approximately half major depressive patient seek treatment illness 20 % individual report treatment satisfactory . Many MDD patient respond pharmacological therapy follow first course treatment , result need alternative measure alleviate clinical cognitive symptom treatment-resistant depression target therapy well suit individual patient . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) well-accepted , non-invasive technique utilizes current induce electrical field excite specific brain region . The current recommended practice rTMS involve administration biphasic stimulus waveform ; however , novel method use monophasic pulse may prove effective treatment depression . The present study aim determine effect monophasic rTMS compare biphasic rTMS cognitive processing MDD patient electrophysiological recording brain take 6 week stimulation . Additionally , study aim investigate various biological marker link clinical rTMS response ; brain marker help personalize treatment individual suffer MDD .</brief_summary>
