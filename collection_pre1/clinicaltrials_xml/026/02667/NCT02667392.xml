	<brief_summary>Approximately 15,000 Veterans hospitalize stroke year new case cost estimate $ 111 million acute inpatient , $ 75 million post-acute inpatient , $ 88 million follow-up care 6 month post-stroke . Rehabilitation walk ability contribute cost . To `` walk '' number one state goal Veterans stroke . Teaching patient post-stroke use weak leg regain walk function compensate over-using strong leg necessary restore safe , efficient walk ability . This project determine provide biofeedback ( audible tone ) pressure-sensitive shoe insole sensor , encourage use weak leg walk training , addition therapist ' feedback , help Veterans regain use weak leg , improve endurance improve balance walk challenging environment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biofeedback Increase Propulsion During Walking After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Purpose : Approximately 15,000 Veterans hospitalize stroke year . Impairments motor control subsequent functional limitation ambulation common manifestation regain ability walk number one state goal Veteran stroke survivor . Forward propulsion body 's center mass cardinal feature gait depend generation appropriate anterior-posterior ground reaction force . Decreased propulsive force generation paretic limb stroke survivor identify simulation cross-sectional study major contributor walk dysfunction . Extrinsic verbal feedback therapist standard approach use gait retrain improve propulsion generation . However , key component gait directly observable therapist patient often unable sense propulsion generation due impaired intrinsic feedback , specifically deficits somatosensation proprioception , hinder recovery paretic propulsion compromise walk function . The objective study provide preliminary evidence biofeedback adjuvant therapist ' verbal feedback improve propulsion enhance walk function Veterans post-stroke . Subjects : Thirty individual &gt; 6-months post-stroke participate . Additional study criterion include : 1 ) Ambulation household distance without physical assistance advance support paretic leg ; 2 ) Unilateral leg paresis confirm score &lt; 32 Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment ; 3 ) Step length asymmetry ( paretic &gt; non-paretic step length ) ; 4 ) Ambulation without assistive orthotic device . Methods : Participants randomize either experimental group train propulsion biofeedback commercially available pressure-sensitive insole sensor ( Biofeedback group ; n=15 ) control group train standard therapist-provided verbal feedback alone ( Standard group ; n=15 ) . The 12 session ( 3X/week 4 week ) gait train intervention deliver physical therapist-led team . For participant Biofeedback group , prior first intervention session , baseline amount pressure exert paretic forefoot late stance determine . The insole area underlie forefoot calibrate produce tone pressure exceed 5 % baseline pressure . This threshold progressively increase regular interval throughout intervention period ensure participant train challenge-point improve propulsion paretic limb . An insole similar thickness worn shoe non-paretic leg symmetry comfort produce tone intervention . Those Standard group wear insoles intervention receive verbal feedback alone regard propulsion paretic limb gait training . Therapist-provided verbal feedback use instruct participant achieve and/or maintain appropriate movement pattern contribute propulsion generation . For group , therapist choose standardized bank gait activity , suitable participant 's ability level . The goal total walking time session 50 minute : 5 , 10-minute bout 2-minute rest bout . Outcome Measures : Paretic limb propulsion primary outcome measure . Secondary measure include Six Minute Walk Test , Functional Gait Assessment , Fall Self-Efficacy , temporal-distance gait measure gait kinematics , measure pre- post-intervention . Data Analysis Plan : Descriptive statistic provide outcome measure . To identify effect intervention , differences pre- post-training assessment within group ( i.e . change score ) calculate . To test hypothesis , investigator apply independent sample t-tests change score Biofeedback Standard group . Hypothesis test conduct two-sided p &lt; 0.05 level .</detailed_description>
