	<brief_title>FGF-21 Exercise Relation Insulin Secretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) metabolic disorder characterize rise global importance . In Germany alone , seven million people treat currently . T2DM characterize permanently elevate blood glucose level , base insulin resistance follow associate beta cell failure . In previous work investigator could already show increase FGF-21 level accompany increase risk T2DM . Physical activity essential treatment prevention T2DM . Interestingly , show acute physical exercise lead decreased insulin level increase FGF-21 value . In study effect acute physical activity FGF-21 value investigate 3 group : ) Healthy volunteer b ) person T2DM c ) person T1DM .</detailed_description>
