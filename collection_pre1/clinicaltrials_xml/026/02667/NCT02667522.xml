	<detailed_description>Depression anxiety among frequently diagnose psychological disorder , persistent pattern impairment evident childhood adulthood . Impaired function core brain system respond reward error may increase risk depression anxiety . Importantly , neural risk marker depression anxiety appear shape , least part , environmental input . Problematic parenting key environmental factor involve intergenerational transmission depression anxiety . Low positive parenting associate blunt brain response reward harsh parenting associate heighten brain response error . This study use evidence-based parent program test causal link dimension positive harsh parent child 's brain response reward error . Participants include 80 6- 7-year-old child mother randomly assign participate parenting program ( Parent Child Interaction Therapy : PCIT ) waitlist control group , brain response reward error assess pre- post-intervention .</detailed_description>
