	<brief_summary>The study aim isolate single type patient ( pediatric patient acute gastrointestinal symptom ) evaluate use hypotonic ( 0.45 NS ) vs. isotonic ( 0.9 NS ) fluids patient regard change serum sodium iatrogenic hyponatremia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reexamining Hypotonic Intravenous Fluid Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize patient-blinded 0.45 NS-controlled clinical trial evaluate child age 6 month 16 year present Emergency Department ( ED ) Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children 's Hospital Chicago ( Lurie Children 's ) vomit and/or diarrhea require intravenous fluid therapy . Children treat fluid bolus per ED physician 's discretion standard care . After initial intravenous therapy , child admit medical observation unit general medicine floor additional fluid therapy . Per standard care , evaluate clinically treat physician determine additional 0.9 NS bolus require administer time . Per standard care , treat physician obtain information need complete admission history physical documentation base information able determine patient eligible study . The treat physician complete Initial Screening Form document whether patient eligible . If patient eligible , treat physician obtain consent inform investigator patient may obtain consent ( depend whether treat hospitalist train obtain consent ) . For patient consent participate , information admission History Physical exam extract Study Form A . Recruitment occur Lurie Children 's . The consent form provide write information family ; recruitment material . A sign reminder study post physician area . Those eligible consent participate study randomize receive either 5 % dextrose contain 0.45 NS 5 % dextrose 0.9 NS maintenance fluid ( see table ) . If treating physician would like include potassium IVF , potassium concentration standard potassium concentration group ( 20 mEq/liter ) . The use potassium concentration part standard care unless patient contraindication inclusion ; decision make treat physician alter inclusion study use potassium impact result . Block randomization utilize use sequential envelope contain preselected fluid type . This seal envelope open attend hospitalist put fluid order . Fluids cover opaque bag patient parent blind study fluid type . Attending hospitalist physician nursing staff blind study fluid data study objective measurement primary outcome objective laboratory measurement . The standard fluid administration rate determine patient weight use formula apply group . Baseline electrolytes blood pressure check upon acceptance study ( prior maintenance fluid administration ) 8 hour . Patients study basic electrolyte panel drawn IV catheter begin study prior start IVF . We follow standardize protocol obtain labs IV catheter . If sample obtained way , obtain via blood draw vein family agrees . These laboratory study order physician complete trained nursing and/or laboratory staff . This study require 0.5ml blood provide baseline blood level sodium , chloride , bicarbonate , potassium , glucose . Complete medical family historical data socio-demographic information obtain patient part routine admission hospital information extract patient chart comparison two group . A majority patient admit IVF either unable take fluid mouth take insufficient amount fluid , especially first 8 hour hospitalization . We anticipate patient NPO ( nothing mouth ) clear fluid diet first 8 hour hospital stay , reduce oral salt intake . Information regard oral fluid intake first 8 hour also extract patient chart ( intake output chart ) . Patients otherwise treat per discretion physician aspect care , include decision stop maintenance IVF therapy . After 8 hour , study IVF remove second basic electrolyte panel obtain . This provide information change blood sodium level well electrolyte . After study fluid remove blood sample obtain , treat physician may choose continue IVF either type fluid discontinue fluid . If patient require IVF full 8 hour , second blood sample obtain patient study IVF &gt; 5 hour . In circumstance , second blood draw obtain whenever treat physician decides stop study IVF . If IVF stop early 5 hour , primary outcome change sodium &gt; 3 le relevant . Thus , patient remove study second blood sample obtain . This study conduct entirely hospitalization period . Based preliminary study conduct evaluate 103 patient admitted nausea , diarrhea , dehydration , average length stay intravenous fluid 63 hour great 99 % patient need 8 hour intravenous fluid . Thus , study would conduct within first 8 hour therapy extend either length stay IVF administration . No additional clinic visitation , hospitalization , outpatient resource utilize . This study involve laboratory study involve radiographic study invasive procedure .</detailed_description>
