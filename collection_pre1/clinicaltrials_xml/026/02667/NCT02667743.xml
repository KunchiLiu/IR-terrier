	<brief_summary>An open-label randomized control clinical trial : This study compare anticancer efficacy safety First-Line Treatment patient Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Paclitaxel Micelles Injection In combination Cisplatin versus Paclitaxel Injection Containing Cremophor EL ( polyoxyethylenated castor oil ) In combination Cisplatin way open-label , randomize control clinical trial . Treatment Protocol : The subject randomize Paclitaxel Micelles Injection Group Paclitaxel Injection Group proportion 2:1 . The centralized randomization method adopt trial . Since study comparison first-line treatment , test superiority adopt . The objective response rate primary indicator efficacy study . Trial Group : Paclitaxel Micelles Injection Cisplatin intravenously administrate . Three week constitute one course treatment . No pretreatment , include anti-allergic prevention antiemetic prophylaxis , require patient infusion Paclitaxel Micelles Injection patient . Control Group : Conventional Paclitaxel Injection Cisplatin intravenously administrate . Three week constitute one course treatment . Standard preventive treatment must give patient accordance specific requirement specification Paclitaxel Injection . Regardless Trial Group Control Group , six treatment period shall upper limit . To estimate sample size base objective remission indicator ( CR + PR ) study . Hypothesis : objective remission rate Paclitaxel Micelles Injection combine Cisplatin Trial Group different first-line treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer , also different Cremophor EL-containing Paclitaxel Injection combine Cisplatin Control Group . Trial parameter setting : assume α = 0.05 1-β = 80 % , Trial Group : Control Group design per proportion 2 : 1 . According sample size formula , total 426 patient require , include 284 patient assigned Trial Group 142 Control Group . In consideration case expulsion process clinical , enlarge 10 % , actually 468 case include group , include 312 Trial Group 156 Control Group .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Firstline patient locally advance metastatic NSCLC ( Clinical Stage ⅢB/Ⅳ , TNM ( primary tumor , regional node , metastasis ) Staging Edition 7 ) confirm histological cytological diagnosis postoperative recurrence ; Firstline patient include : 1 . Patients newly diagnose ⅢB/Ⅳ undergone radiotherapy chemotherapy molecular target treatment ; 2 . Patients postoperative reoccurrence metastasis receive adjuvant radiotherapy chemotherapy molecular target treatment ; 3 . Patients postoperative reoccurrence metastasis receive adjuvant radiotherapy chemotherapy molecular target treatment , one year since end therapy treatment . 4 . Patients receive prior radiotherapy enrol . However , radiation area must &lt; 25 % bone marrow area , prior radiotherapy complete least 4 week enrollment , acute radiation toxicity must restore . Local lesion undergo radiotherapy allow include measurable lesion save lesion significant progress record last radiotherapy . 2 . Patients available measurable lesion line requirement `` measurable lesion '' response evaluation criterion `` RECIST Version 1.1 '' . Lesions least one accurately measurable diameter ( serve maximum diameter ) : maximum diameter target lesion CT scan ≥20 mm maximum diameter spiral CT MRI scan ≥10 mm ; 3 . ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) score ≤ 1 point expect survival least 3 month ; 4 . 18 70 year old , male female ; 5 . Blood picture function major organ heart , lung , liver , kidneys basically normal . 6 . Blood routine test must meet following criterion : 1 . ANC≥1.5×109/L； 2 . PLT≥100×109/L； 3 . Hb≥90g/L。 7 . Blood biochemical test must meet following criterion : 1 . Plasma total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; 2 . ALT ( Alanine aminotransferase ) , AST ( Aspartate transaminase ) AKP≤2.5 × ULN ( patient hepatic metastasis , ALT , AST AKP≤5 × ULN ; patient bone metastasis , AKP≤10 × ULN ) ; 3 . Cr ≤1.5 × ULN ; 8 . Patients cardiac insufficiency symptom baseline ; serious abnormal sign ECG 9 . Efficacy cancerrelated imaging examination complete within 2 week enrollment clinical condition assessment , three routine test blood , urea , stool , blood biochemical examination , ECG , CEA ( carcinoembryonic antigen ) examination complete within 1 week enrollment ; 10 . Patients understand purpose clinical trial , participate , sign informed consent ; 11 . Patients good compliance , accept doctor 's followup evaluation , voluntarily follow treatment protocol study ; 12 . Male female patient childbearing potential voluntarily take contraceptive measure trial . In case follow circumstance , patient allow participate study : 1 . Patients know mutant EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) , ALK ( anaplastic lymphoma kinase ) genetic examination ; 2 . Patients primary brain central nervous metastasis ( include leptomeningeal metastasis ) , exclude patient asymptomatic single brain metastasis strict control ; patient central nervous tumor accompany cerebral hypertension neuropsychiatric symptom ; 3 . Patients noneliminated acute chronic infection patient also suffer serious disease simultaneously ; 4 . Patients complete entire trial process investigator may deem fit ; 5 . Patients peripheral neuropathy grade I ; 6 . Patients allergic history Paclitaxel ; 7 . The existence third space effusion control drainage mean ( middle large pleural effusion , middle large pericardial effusion ascites ) ; patient asymptomatic small pleural effusion require clinical intervention may enrol subject strict control ; 8 . Patients mental illness mental disorder , poor compliance , account treatment response ; 9 . Patients poor tolerability due serious organic disease major organ failure , decompensated heart lung failure ; 10 . Patients bleed tendency disease ; 11 . Organ transplant recipient ; 12 .
