	<brief_title>Exploration Potential Role Brain Magnetic Stimulation Preventing Relapse Alcohol Abuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 : ( 2 week ) , participant undergo set baseline assessment , include questionnaire , rating scale , rest state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rsfMRI ) . Phase 2 , patient receive one two treatment : High-frequency ( 10Hz , 100 train 1.9 sec 15 sec inter train interval ) dTMS target ACC sham stimulation 30 min . Each treatment precede short guide imagery ( 1-2 min ) design activate relevant brain circuitry ( provocation symptom may increase response rate Deep TMS evident treatment PTSD , cigarette smoking OCD ) . dTMS session conduct five time per week 3 week , total 15 session . A second rsfMRI scan obtain end phase . Phase 3 include 12 week patient follow-up , include clinical visit week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 12 post treatment . During phase , subjective objective measure alcohol use ( self-report analysis urine sample level ethyl glucuronide ( EtG ) ethyl sulfate ( EtS ) [ 2 ] , respectively ) collect . Following completion main part individual , `` open label '' treatment use parameter experiment offer ( regardless treatment group ) .</detailed_description>
