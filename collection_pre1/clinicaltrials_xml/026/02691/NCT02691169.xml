	<brief_summary>There several new therapy available treat men advance prostate cancer ; however , decision making tool need determine best treatment patient noticeably absent . The prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) increasingly recognize important target prostate cancer image determine effective therapy . Accordingly , wide variety agent use image PSMA . One agents 18F-DCFPyL . In study investigator image men advance prostate cancer use 18F-DCFPyL positron emission compute tomography ( PET/CT ) scanner . The investigator compare result 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT detection metastasis monitor effect therapy conventional imaging ( CT , bone scan ) clinical follow-up . In way , investigator evaluate benefit use 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT decide best treatment strategy man advance prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This exploratory single centre , non-randomized , open-label , study male subject metastatic , castrate-resistant PCa ( CRPC ) treat second-line anti-androgen therapy ( enzalutamide abiraterone ) . The purpose study ass 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT : 1 . Shows sit metastatic , castrate-resistant PCa ( CRPC ) compare standard imaging ( bone scan CT ) baseline follow-up , 2 . Shows response therapy associate clinical outcome . This study image male subject CRPC undergo second-line anti-androgen therapy ( enzalutamide abiraterone ) use 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT detection metastases therapeutic monitoring , correlation standard-of-care imaging ( CT bone scan ) clinical follow-up 1-year time period . Subjects CRPC plan treatment evidence metastases standard-of-care imaging ( CT and/or bone scan ) undergo baseline mid-therapy 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT . The study design consist three study clinic visit ( screen , baseline 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT , 8-14 week follow-up 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT ) two follow-up safety phone call . In addition , subject follow clinically per local standard care prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) blood level standard care image one year follow baseline 18F-DCFPyL administration .</detailed_description>
