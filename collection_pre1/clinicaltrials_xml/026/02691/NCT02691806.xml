	<brief_summary>Sometimes , strenuous aerobic activity , activity cease discomfort follow lack oxygen would intolerable . Reaching fatigue condition cause organ damage , muscular damage / different tissue body . In study , investigator aim develop new index , base hemodynamics measurement peripheral micro - circulation system , benefit early detection fatigue accelerate physical activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>14 healthy volunteer , 7 male 7 female , age 18-30 participate study.The study include 2 stage : In first stage , aerobic capacity subject measure measure maximum oxygen consumption ( VO2max test ) . This phase conduct determine physical measurement could indicate different stage muscle fatigue ( anaerobic threshold , maximum oxygen consumption , heart rate breathing index ) . In second phase , subject perform physical effort protocol carry first stage . Non- invasive measurement leg muscle activity aerobic exercise rest ( activity ) , carry use wireless EMG . Additionally , hemodynamic measurement oxygen level skin skin perfusion monitor strenuous activity perform use two optic sensor .</detailed_description>
