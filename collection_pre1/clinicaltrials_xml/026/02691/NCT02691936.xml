	<detailed_description>This multi-centered , randomized prospective single blind clinical trial compare CO2 fractionate vaginal laser therapy vaginal estrogen cream therapy treatment vulvovaginal atrophy/GSM . Subject Recruitment Screening Study subject recruit patient present clinical site Women 's Health Institute Cleveland Clinic , Christ Hospital , Stanford University Hospital , MedStar Washington Hospital Center , Women 's Infants ' Hospital Rhode Island Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center treatment GSM . Cleveland Clinic serve central Data Coordinating Center Study Identification Recruitment Potential subject identify member section Urogynecology Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery Benign Gynecology respective institution . Eligible patient agree participate provide write informed consent administer collaborator list IRB . Randomization The participant randomize either fractional CO2 vaginal laser therapy vaginal estrogen cream accord computer-generated randomization schedule random block size use SAS statistical software package ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . All patient unblinded assignment . Diagnostic Therapeutic Interventions In addition standardize evaluation include history physical examination , patient ask complete Female Sexual Function Inventory ( FSFI ) questionnaire , Day-to-day Impact Vaginal Aging ( DIVA ) questionnaire , Urogenital Distress Inventory ( UDI-6 ) , baseline , 3 month , 6 month baseline visual analog scale ( VAS ) GSM symptom . The Patient Global Index ( PGI ) also administer 6 month . Completion questionnaire take 15-20 minute . A vaginal maturation index obtain baseline visit regular Pap Smear side fix cytofixative air dry . This repeat last follow visit 6 month . Vaginal Laser Protocol Postmenopausal woman undergo treatment intravaginally fractional microablative CO 2 laser system ( SmartXide 2 V 2 LR , MonaLisa Touch , DEKA , Florence , Italy ) , use follow setting : dot power 30 watt , dwell time 1000 μ , dot spacing 1000 μ smart stack parameter 1 3 . Stack 1 used baseline stack 3 6 week 3 month . The laser beam apply use 90° vaginal probe gently insert top vaginal canal subsequently withdraw centimeter interval rotate 6 position alternate clockwise counterclockwise pattern order provide complete treatment vaginal wall . At investigator discretion flat probe ( vulvar probe ) may utilize efficiently treat introital area vestibule . At level vaginal introitus , dot power decrease 26 watt . A treatment cycle include three laser application ( every 40-50 day , approximately 6 week ) . The procedure perform outpatient clinic require specific preparation ( e.g . analgesia/anesthesia ) . At clinician 's discretion , EMLA cream may apply introitus thirty minute wipe clean dry prior vulvar laser therapy . Patients recommend avoid coital sexual activity least 3 day laser application mild inflammatory reaction may last 48 hour laser therapy . Topical lidocaine 5 % ointment may use vulvar pain post-procedure . Post Treatment Instructions - Each subject shall evaluate immediately post-treatment complication side effect , excessive bleeding , symptomatic vaginal discharge , pain , etc . - Each study subject ask assess discomfort treatment use 5-point Likert scale . - The patient instruct specific activity limitation follow procedure , sedentary activity recommend least day . - The subject engage vigorous exercise contact sport least 72 hour , approve physician . - The subject refrain douche least 72 hour procedure . - Subjects engage intercourse least 72 hour post procedure . - The subject may shower may bathe day follow procedure . They use regular shower gel soap . Vaginal Estrogen Protocol The woman vaginal estrogen group prescribe ask administer conjugate estrogen cream 0.5 g cream ( equivalent 0.625 mg conjugate estrogen ) intravaginally daily two week ( fourteen day ) twice weekly 24 ± 2 additional week . Vaginal examination Vaginal Health Index ( VHI ) score include vaginal pH obtain use litmus paper baseline follow-up examination record . This obtained baseline , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month follow-up blind examiner prior assessment vaginal wall elasticity silastic dilator . A limited vaginal exam perform assess condition vaginal area . This exam include vaginal calibration , perform standard vaginal dilator ( Syracuse Medical ) . The investigator determine large dilator five size available ( XS , S , M , L , XL ) , subject comfortably place vagina . The subject assess much pain experience dilator place vagina , use 5-point Likert scale . - GSM symptom ( vaginal dryness , vaginal burning , vaginal itching , dysuria ) assess use VAS . - Patient evaluation overall treatment ( PGI ) use 5-point Likert scale conduct 6 week , 3 month 6 month follow-up visit . - After treatment , PI co-investigator ask evaluate ease treatment use 5-point Likert scale . - After treatment , subject ask degree discomfort experience result treatment use 5-point Likert scale . - Events evaluate record . Questionnaires evaluation Questionnaires administer research nurse coordinator blind patient 's therapy . Sexual function , GSM , urinary function evaluate 10- cm VAS , Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) , Day-to-day Impact Vaginal Aging ( DIVA ) , Urogenital Distress Inventory ( UDI-6 ) , baseline prior 1st laser treatment commence vaginal estrogen ( depend treatment group ) , 12 week baseline ( +/- 1week ) prior 3rd laser treatment ( applicable ) , 3 month follow-up 3rd laser treatment ( applicable ) . Note patient follow 6 month baseline visit final assessment . The DIVA questionnaire administer baseline , 3 month , 6 month follow-up visit period , addition FSFI , UDI-6 , VHI , PGI final assessment . Data Collection &amp; Management : Baseline data include follow : - Patient age , race , vaginal parity , menopausal state , BMI , history previous use vaginal estrogen - FSFI , DIVA , UDI-6 questionnaires - VAS GSM symptom VHI objective GSM finding Data point record procedure include : - Likert Scales physician assessment patient comfort procedure . - Adverse event include inability complete procedure due discomfort constrict vagina Post-procedure data include follow : - The rate satisfaction patient treatment mean Patient Global Impression Improvement ( PGI ) , use 5-point Likert scale . - The degree difficulty encounter physician performing treatment , mean 5-point Likert scale . - Additionally , untoward side effect treatment new bothersome vaginal irritation significant vaginal bleeding record . Protection subject 's personal health information priority study .
