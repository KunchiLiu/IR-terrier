	<detailed_description>The investigator propose randomized clinical trial 240 depressed individual assign one three arm , successive arm add component may serve increase maintain physical activity : 1. brief advice ( BA ) exercise ( control condition ) ; 2 . BA + supervise &amp; home-based exercise ( SHE ) +health education ( HE ) contact control ; 3 . BA+SHE+ cognitive-behavioral session focus increase maintain exercise ( CBEX ) . There two phase participant : intervention phase ( 3 month ) , consist intensive contact , follow-up phase ( 6 month ) . BA consist one , 45-minute session public health recommendation , strategy get start . SHE 12-week intervention consist 1x/week supervised exercise plus exercise prescription home-based exercise goal gradually achieve public health recommendation 150 minutes/week moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) , CBEX HE sessions individual , 30-minute , weekly session intervention phase . CBEX address barrier physical activity particularly pronounce depression -i.e. , anhedonia , decrease motivation , decrease energy , well poor problem-solving skill . During follow-up phase , group receive SHE intervention phase receive brief , monthly phone check-in exercise specialist . Primary Aims : 1 . To compare efficacy 3 arm increase physical activity 12-week intervention phase . We hypothesize BA + SHE + CBEX superior BA + SHE + HE , BA + SHE + HE superior BA alone term objectively measure MVPA level . 2 . To compare longer-term impact three arm objectively-measured minute MVPA 6- 9-month follow-up ( i.e. , follow-up phase ) . Hypotheses intervention phase ( aim # 1 ) . Secondary Aims : 3 . To assess impact propose intervention combination depression , physical health outcome include cardiorespiratory fitness body composition , self-reported MVPA phase . Hypotheses mirror describe primary aim . 4 . To determine whether amount MVPA mediate association group assignment change depressive symptom . We hypothesize amount MVPA serve mediator . 5 . To examine behavior change theory-based mediator association group assignment MVPA . Hypothesized mediator include : perceived benefit exercise , perceive barrier exercise , exercise self-efficacy , intrinsic motivation exercise , identify motivation exercise . 6 . To examine whether social environmental barrier exercise predict exercise maintenance .</detailed_description>
