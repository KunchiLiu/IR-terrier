	<detailed_description>Physical decline frailty result age- disease-related impairment organs tissue . Frailty research focus musculoskeletal , neurological circulatory system ; yet intervention target system limit success prevent treat functional decline . Given age US population , additional avenue intervention development urgently need . Fragility disability people â‰¥65 strongly correlate decline kidney function evident even early stage chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Moreover , CKD highly prevalent elderly associate sarcopenia , osteopenia , increase incidence fractures/falls hospitalization . Low serum bicarbonate impair acid-base homeostasis , also common CKD , increasingly appreciated contributor functional decline advance age . With age , adaptive response kidney low serum bicarbonate high metabolic acid load become maladaptive , facilitate CKD progression . Conversely , adult patient CKD , maintenance serum bicarbonate 24 meq/L oral bicarbonate supplementation increase consumption base-forming food slow CKD progression . The study investigator propose current study protocol base evidence summarize preliminary study , suggest : In Health Aging Body Composition cohort ( age 70-79 ) low dietary acid load associate stable kidney function 7-year follow-up , independent age , race , gender , BMI , diabetes , hypertension smoking status ; metabolomics analysis participant African American Diabetes Heart Study suggest feasible segregate urine metabolomics profile early stage CKD ( stag 2 3 ) , low consumption base-forming fruit vegetables high rate acid excretion may associate CKD progression . The investigator therefore hypothesize decrease metabolic acid production titrate dietary acid load may ameliorate generally expect , age-related decline kidney function , decrease loss lean body mass , preserve physical function , ameliorate disability . This treatment study investigator explore effect bicarbonate age-related issue .</detailed_description>
