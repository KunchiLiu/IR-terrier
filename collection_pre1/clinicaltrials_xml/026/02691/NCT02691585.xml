	<brief_summary>Blood pressure ( BP ) reduce significantly listen Indian music among prehypertensives hypertensive subject give musical piece compose raga 'bhimpalas ' ( raga normalizes BP ) hear daily 3 month . On retrospection methodology , effect single raga ( Bhimpalas ) alone test . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) record recruitment follow 3 month fail show change . The acute effect music HRV listen raga bhimpalas , effect ragas list Gandharva veda test . Respiratory rate control ( affect HRV ) EEG wave study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Indian Ragas Health - Electrophysiological Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INDIAN MUSIC : 'Raga ' ( musical scale ) set musical note present orderly manner order generate melody . Matanga ( 9-10th century AD ) work 'Brihaddeshi ' early define raga `` raga kind sound composition consist melodic movement effect colour heart men '' . However , study use Indian classical music intervention study health benefit . Gandharvaveda , part Sama veda , mention various ragas myriad health benefits.Dr . Burnell mention manuscript name raga chikistsa collection Saraswati Mahal Library Tanjore deal various ragas use cure various ailment . For example raga Malkauns say help cure hypotension . Insomnic patient say benefit usage raga Behag . 'Heart Rate Variability ' become conventionally accepted term describe beat-to-beat alteration HR , RR interval ECG . The cause HRV consider respiratory sinus arrhythmia well low-frequency oscillation ( 0.1 Hz ) associate Traube-Hering-Mayer wave BP . It find decrease HRV strong predictor mortality acute myocardial infarction . HRV assess either time frequency domain method . EFFECT OF MUSIC ON BLOOD PRESSURE : Many study show modification cardiorespiratory parameter repeat rhythymic recitation prayer , poetry yoga mantra . So surprising music ( rhythmic repetition note tone ) also similar effect . A number study report listen sedative music ( slow tempo , legato phrasing , minimal dynamic contrast ) lead decrease HR BP . BP show proportional crescendo present music , music uniform emphasis reduce BP . Passive listen music daily basis help reduce BP 12 elderly subject . The experimental group listen select song 25 minute every day , four week . BP measure twice week . There significant decrease mean BP : 11.8 mmHg SBP 4.7 mmHg DBP . Elderly subject show statistically significant reduction SBP DBP 12-minute audio relaxation program . STUDIES ON EFFECT OF MUSIC ON HRV : Whether music cause increase decrease HR , remain mystery . Several study report various condition music decrease sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) increase parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) activity measure HR HRV , indicate physiological relaxation . No difference HR HRV observe investigator . However , increase HR also report . SALIVARY STRESS MARKERS : The salivary gland receive sympathetic parasympathetic innervation . The major enzyme release sympathetic stimulation alpha ( α ) amylase . Thus presume , change salivary alpha amylase indicate activity SM system stress . Further , salivary cortisol alpha amylase use number researcher recently quantify stress biomarkers stress . Nevertheless , also put forth salivary amylase activity index plasma norepinephrine level variety stressful condition . STUDIES ON EFFECT OF MUSIC ON EEG : In one study EEG record give alpha music ten subject , observed increase maximum amplitude Alpha wave either 6 minute 12 minute alpha music . However , maximum amplitude beta wave show decline 40 % initial value . These result , namely , increase Alpha activity decrease Beta activity indicate subject experience ` relaxed alertness ' . Setting : Medical college Tertiary care hospital Case group ( totally 3 group ) = 35 subject group ; total sample 105 Control group = 35 subject Basis sample size : Based study conduct Okada et al , find RMSSD ( root mean square standard deviation NN interval ECG ) 17.4±7.2 m 24.1±15.5 m music therapy effect size 0.59 power 90 % confidence interval 95 % , minimum sample size require present study estimate 32 . Methods material : The effect least 3 different Indian classical music ragas autonomic function brain wave subject study . Healthy subject recruit M S Ramaiah Instituitions . Selection bias avoid randomization use computer generate random number . All number generate kept opaque seal envelope . The envelope open research assistant baseline assessment participant assign seven group randomly , intervention control category . Each group randomly assign listen particular raga use block randomization . The control group , seventh group , receive raga , HRV , BP , EEG saliva record collect . Literature give Gandharva veda raga chikitsa use choose ragas vary health benefit especially cardiovascular system . The ragas say normalize BP ahir bhairav , bhimpalas , hindol , puriya , kausikanada todi . Ahir Bhairav , Kausi Kanada &amp; Bhimpalas use present study . Detailed methodology : The investigator include question inquire subject ' preference type music , previous experience music instrumental vocal training note . A general health check do subject . The BMI , waist hip ratio BP sit position measure twice five minute rest ( Sphygmomanometry ) note . A stress questionnaire ( State Trait Anxiety Inventory ) administer prior intervention ass baseline level stress change stress level music intervention . Subjects make lie supine relax ten minute . EEG electrodes apply accord 10-20 system . A baseline EEG ( Galileo NT ) ECG lead II 10 minute ( Power lab 15 T Labchart AD instrument ) record . Baseline digital measurement BP do . Saliva baseline stress marker ( cortisol amylase ) collect . All subject instruct breathe rate 6 breath per minute , throughout procedure monitor software . After , raga Indian classical music play 10 minute duration via earplug connect laptop , time record ECG EEG continue . The time start music mark use event marker software . Post ten minute , music stop BP record saliva collect . ECG EEG record continue another ten minute study residual effect music heart BP record saliva collect ( end 30 minute procedure ) . Stress questionnaire administer end procedure . For control group baseline BP , ECG EEG record ten minute rest condition . Saliva collect store . EEG analyze use Galileo NT software . HRV analyze use software provide . The saliva sample centrifuge 3000 rpm 15 minute supernatant saliva store -20° C analysis cortisol amylase ( ELISA ) .</detailed_description>
