	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , double blind active-controlled Phase 2b study . 222 subject randomize 1:1:1 three group receive two sequential non-adjuvanted 0.5 mg 1.0mg intramuscular injection M-001 ( treatment ) , two placebo ( saline ) injection , receive Alum adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine sub optimal dose 3mcg . Hemagglutinin inhibition ( HAI ) evaluate baseline 3 week H5N1 whole virion inactivate pandemic influenza vaccination measure M-001 's ability enhance humoral response . Cell mediate immune ( CMI ) responses also evaluate baseline immunization M-001 measure M-001 's standalone immunogenicity . The subject monitor safety throughout study day 180 .</detailed_description>
