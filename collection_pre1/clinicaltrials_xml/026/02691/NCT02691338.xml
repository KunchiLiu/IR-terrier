	<brief_summary>The incidence perioperative stroke non-cardiac , non-vascular , non-neurological high risk surgical population 2 % . It high ( ~5 % ) cardiac surgery carotid endarterectomy patient , stroke associate mortality 60 % . These patient could immediately treat condition detect time . Currently , standard brain monitoring procedure anaesthetise patient . The purpose propose study optimize validate online monitor neurological deterioration anaesthesia base easily operatable EEG system comprise 4 electrode , reference electrode newely develop algorithm analyze EEG signal . The monitor aim generate immediate warning onset neurological deterioration . For purpose technology development minimal sample size , necessary select patient population demonstrate significant neurological dynamic anaesthesia . We therefore focus anesthesized patient undergo neurovascular thrombectomy CVA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research aim validate novel ground-breaking easy-to-use EEG-based algorithm sense cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) event anaesthesia . Today standard tool CVA detection anaesthetize patient . Thus possibility wake anaesthesia severe brain damage devastate . Patients undergoing cardiac surgery ( valve replacement , CABG , thoracic aorta replacement , PTCA , TAVI ( trans-aortic valve implantation ) ) , carotid endarterectomy surgery sit position , exceptionally high risk . We develop unique algorithm detect brain ischemia anaesthetize patient , base data acquire 4 EEG electrode . Our final goal develop system trigger alarm ischemia occur anaesthetized patient peri-operative period . In order validate optimize system , require small sample size test validate technology . The population study include patient acute CVA undergo mechanical thrombectomy anaesthesia . Although patient already CVA , clinical dynamic high population , enable demonstration ability recognize immediate change neurological status ( improvement deterioration ) . We believe innovative EEG base system could major significance million patient annually .</detailed_description>
