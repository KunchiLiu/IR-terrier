	<brief_title>Epigenetic Regulation Immunity Alpha-1 Anti-trypsin Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The variable natural clinical course alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency ( AATD ) disease strong influence environmental exposure smoke , implicate major role epigenetic mechanism modify AATD disease penetrance . The goal study proposal investigate epigenetic regulation alveolar macrophage ( AM ) inflammation function AATD PiZZ patient . The investigator proposal focus epigenetic histone modification gene expression specifically AM . AAT augmentation therapy , alters disease symptom , may also modulate AM epigenetics . To identify epigenetic regulation AM inflammation AATD context AAT therapy , investigator perform computationally integrate ChIP-seq RNA-seq data . This help elucidate immunomodulatory mechanism regulate AATD provide epigenetic map diagnosis target treatment . The investigator test efficacy FDA-approved histone modify drug , SAHA specific next-generation histone modifier , GSK-J4 , modulate AM AATD-associated activity ex vivo . The goal study enroll total 13 AATD case 6 healthy control . All AATD patient ask give blood sample undergo bronchoscopy . AATD patient also ask undergo follow bronchoscopy blood draw 6 month treatment alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy study change marker augmentation therapy .</detailed_description>
