	<brief_title>Genes Associated With Development Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Patients With Congenital Shunt Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) patient congenital heart disease ( CHD ) usually develop secondary chronic volume overload pulmonary circulation follow leave right shunt . This overload lead elevate pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) later increase pulmonary vascular resistance . This cause pressure overload right heart , thereby right ventricular right atrial dysfunction , may implicate considerable morbidity even mortality . Since PAH nowadays mostly detect symptom occur PAP elevate , disease already evolve advanced ( partially irreversible ) stage treatment often initiate late . Next environmental risk factor , investigator believe important role genetic predisposition develop PAH CHD . In past , certain gene identify play role development atrial septal defect ( ASD ) . There also lot gene identify play role PAH . Until , many research group study genetic link CHD PAH development . But become clear often discrepancy severity PAH CHD , useful screen PAH gene mutation . The investigator hypothesize mutation know PAH gene , still unidentified , gene partly responsible phenotypic variability patient congenital shunt lesion , develop PAH others . If genetic predisposition PAH CHD could identify , genetic screening could useful additional tool early detection patient risk pulmonary vascular disease PAH development , new opportunity prevention early treatment .</detailed_description>
