	<brief_summary>GSK2269557 potent highly selective inhale Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase delta inhibitor develop anti-inflammatory anti-infective agent treatment inflammatory airway disease . The study conduct single centre 3 Parts . The aim Part A B study ass safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics ( PK ) single repeat dose new formulation GSK2269557 administer via ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) healthy subject . This first study GSK2269557 administer via ELLIPTA DPI . Part C study investigate proportion systemic exposure post inhalation due swallow fraction inhale dose . Part C also conduct use ELLIPTA device magnesium stearate formulation . Part A conduct first . Part B Part C may run sequentially parallel . Part A randomized , double blind , placebo control , single dose , dose escalate incomplete block 2-period crossover study healthy subject . Subjects randomize receive either one dose strength GSK2269557 placebo utilize placebo replacement , receive active dose strength . Part B randomize , double blind , placebo control , repeat dose study healthy Subjects . Subjects randomize receive either repeat dos GSK2269557 placebo 10 day . Part C , randomize , open-label , crossover design assess systemic exposure single dos GSK2269557 administer via ELLIPTA DPI healthy subject , without ingestion activate charcoal . ELLIPTA register trademark GlaxoSmithKline group company .</brief_summary>
