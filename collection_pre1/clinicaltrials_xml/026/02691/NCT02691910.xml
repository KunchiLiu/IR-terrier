	<detailed_description>1 . OBJECTIVE- To assess efficacy co-administered chloroquine+primaquine ( CQ+PQ ) vs.CQ alone ( PQ postpone day 28 CQ therapy ) schizontocidal therapy ( 28-day follow-up ) radical cure among uncomplicated P. vivax malaria ( 6-month follow-up ) . Specifically : - To measure clinical parasitological efficacy CQ+PQ vs. CQ alone , 28 day follow-up . - To measure time first recurrent vivax malaria episode , day 29 180 follow-up . 2 . METHODS - This randomize , open-label . The duration follow evaluate CQ efficacy schizonticidal drug 28 day . The duration complete follow detect recurrent P. vivax infection passive surveillance six month . All patient CQ alone arm receive 7 day PQ ( 3.5mg/kg total dose ) start day 28 follow-up . 2.1 STUDY SITE AND POPULATION - The study carry city Cruzeiro Sul , Acre State , westernmost part Amazon Basin Brazil . The study population patient age 5 year diagnose uncomplicated P. vivax malaria , give permission study inclusion . 2.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA - mono-infection P. vivax , age &gt; 5 year , ability swallow oral medication , axillary temperature ≥37.5ºC ( history fever last 48 hour ) agree comply study provide write informed consent . 2.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ENROLLMENT - severe malaria require hospitalization , severe malnutrition ( weight-for-age ≤ 3 standard deviation mean ) , co-infection Plasmodium specie , severe anemia ( Hg &lt; 8g/100 ml ) , hypersensitivity CQ PQ , febrile condition cause disease malaria , serious chronic medical condition , pregnant breastfeed woman , prior history hemolysis severe anemia regular medication may interfere antimalarial pharmacokinetics . 2.4 ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES 2.4.1 . CLINICAL EVALUATION - All patient evaluate sign febrile illness malaria , sign severe disease/danger order exclude patient participate study . Female childbearing age ask pregnant lactating . On screen subsequent visit , patient ask fever last 48 hour his/her current temperature measure . Any disease/surgical condition , drug allergy , use medication herbal supplement record . The patient 's pulse rate , respiratory rate , height , weight result baseline physical examination record . This do screening subsequent visit . 2.5 . LABORATORY EVALUATIONS ON-SITE - Urine β-HCG pregnancy test conduct woman age 13-49 b - Two thick blood smear prepare day 0 follow-up visit ( day 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 180 ) . One thick smear examine site verify parasite specie formal parasite count . The second slide archive late examination . Two qualified microscopist read slide independently . Discordant result re-examined third microscopist , parasite density calculate average two close count . Microscopic diagnosis malaria ( parasite-specific DNA gametocyte-specific RNA transcript ) confirm real-time quantitative PCR day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 28 day parasite recurrence . c - Venous blood sample collect day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 28 day parasite recurrence . It use on-site G6PD test full blood count hemoglobin measurement addition prepare thick smear . Plasma sample store -80°C ( liquid nitrogen ) ship central laboratory São Paulo immunological measurement ( antibody , cytokine ) . The remain whole-blood aliquot cryopreserved DNA RNA extraction CQ measurement ( late day 0 28 day parasite recurrence ) . The whole-blood sample collect day 0 day parasite recurrence cryopreserved ex-vivo drug resistance assay . - Finger-prick blood sample collect day 14 , 21 , 180 use hemoglobin measurement prepare thick smear . Remaining finger-prick blood sample spot onto FTA membrane long-term DNA storage 4°C . e - G6PD test conducted on-site day 0 . If patient G6PD deficient , she/he exclude . 2.6 SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW UP Each patient clinically reassess day 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 180 . Venous blood ( day 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 28 ) capillary ( finger prick ) blood sample ( day 14 , 21 , 180 ) examine malaria parasite visit day patient spontaneously return fever worsening symptom . Hemoglobin status - measure day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 180 , day parasite recurrence . Drug level testing- venous blood collect day 0 , 7 , 28 day recurrent parasitemia measure concentration CQ . Molecular test - P. vivax isolate recurrent infection day 28 would genotypically compare day 0 use panel 14 highly polymorphic microsatellite marker order determine whether recurrence due major parasite population present original infection , minor parasite subpopulation could detect day 0 completely different parasite population . 2.7 TREATMENT All participant receive CQ ( total dose , 25 mg base/kg ) PQ ( total dose , 3.5mg/kg ) supervise study nurse . CQ : day 0 ( 10mg/kg ) , 1 2 ( 7.5mg/kg ) . PQ : day ( 0.5 mg/kg ) seven day , start either day 0 CQ treatment ( concurrent CQ-PQ treatment arm ) day 28 ( CQ alone arm ) . 2.8 FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES 2.8.1 . Active Surveillance - Study participant visit day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 180 . At visit , questionnaire complete ask history fever currently precede month venous capillary sample collect blood slide examination check parasitemia . 2.8.2 . Passive Surveillance - Patients advise return health center day symptom , sign danger ( unable drink breastfeed , vomit everything , present convulsion , lethargic unconscious , unable sit stand , present difficult breathing ) , still sick cause worry . During period PQ administration , anyone reporting dark urine abdominal cramp ( sign toxicity ) seek medical attention . 2.8.3 . Rescue treatment - A recurrent vivax parasitaemia within 28 day potentially recrudescent infection . These patient would re-treated standard CQ-PQ co-administration regimen remain study . After 28 day , recurrent vivax parasitaemia likely relapse new infection . These patient would treat standard CQ-PQ co-administration regimen . Patients develop severe malaria would admit hospital treat accord guideline Ministry Health Brazil . 2.8.4 . Discontinuation/Withdrawal Participants Study Treatment Each participant right withdraw study time . The investigator would withdraw participant participant blood transfusion fall Hb le 7g/dL macroscopic haemoglobinuria fall Hb &gt; 25 % ( within first 14 day 8 week , ) significant protocol deviation , disease progression , lose follow , use drug antimalarial activity , important adverse event emergency event . 3 . END-POINTS 3.1 Schizontocidal Efficacy Chloroquine It derive risk recurrence day 28 CQ arm . - Schizontocidal Therapeutic Failure ( TF ) : clinical deterioration require hospitalization presence asexual parasitemia OR asexual parasitemia temperature &gt; 37.5°C day 3 28 OR parasitemia day 7 28 , irrespective clinical condition . - Adequate Schizontocidal Response ( ACR ) : absence parasitemia day 7 , 14 , 21 28 without previously meet criterion TF . 3.2 Safety end point The main concern PQ lie risk severe hemolytic reaction , fall haemoglobin . However , decrease hemoglobin also occur follow P. vivax malaria . It therefore vital monitor evidence hemolysis clinical significant fall Hb . Hemoglobin concentration assess day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 180 , low level expect day 3 14 . 3.2.1.Adverse Event ( AE ) : Any unfavourable unintended sign , symptom disease temporally associate use study medication , without necessarily causal relationship . 3.2.2.Adverse Reaction ( AR ) . An untoward unintended sign , symptom disease judge suspect causal relationship study medication . 3.2.3.Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) . Any untoward medical occurrence dose result death risk death , require hospitalization , result persistent significant disability/incapacity . 4 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The primary outcome safety data analyze modified intention-to-treat population . A conservative analysis repeat per protocol population exclude patient subsequent major protocol violation . The primary outcome proportion therapeutic failure observe day 28 follow-up study arm . The investigator compare cumulative incidence P. vivax recurrence study arm . SPSS version 17.0 use data management analysis . Data analyze Kaplan-Meier ( KM ) method per-protocol analysis . The time first parasite recurrence within 28 day follow-up ( primary outcome ) day 29 180 ( secondary outcome ) calculate use KM estimate ( survival analysis ) . Statistical comparison make arm use log rank test . The proportion clinical parasitological failure , adequate clinical parasitological response day 28 calculate , respective 95 % confidence interval . 5 . ETHICAL ISSUES - The study fully explain participant ask consent/assent participate . Consenting participant might terminate participation time . All case record form access authorized staff member . Participants informed result exams clinical assessment follow-up visit . 6 . DEFINITION OF TREATMENT OUTCOMES - Early treatment failure ( ETF ) - danger sign severe malaria day 1 , 2 3 presence parasitaemia - parasitaemia day 2 high day 0 , irrespective axillary temperature - parasitaemia day 3 axillary temperature ≥ 37.5 ºC - parasitaemia day 3 ≥25 % count day 0 - Late treatment failure - Late clinical failure ( LCF ) - danger sign severe malaria presence parasitaemia day day 4 day 28 patient previously meet criterion early treatment failure - parasitaemia day day 4 day 28 axillary temperature ≥37.5ºC ( history fever ) patient previously meet criterion early treatment failure - Late parasitological failure ( LPF ) - Parasitaemia day day 7 day 28 axillary temperature &lt; 37.5ºC patient previously meet criterion early treatment failure late clinical failure . - Adequate clinical parasitological response - Absence parasitaemia day 28 , irrespective temperature , patient previously meet criterion ETF , LCF LPF .</detailed_description>
