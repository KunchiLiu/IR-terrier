	<detailed_description>Consenting subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion enrol receive either fluorescein+ALA fluorescein alone . HGG patient randomize 2 1 basis receive either fluorescein ALA fluorescein alone , LGG patient randomize 1 1 basis . This study diagnostic trial fluorescein fluorescence intraoperative imaging biomarker open cranial surgery tumor resection first-time ( preoperatively ) presume high low grade glioma . Subjects participate `` one-time '' event/visit ( i.e , surgery ) part protocol . Images data patient 's pre- post-operative MR scan use analysis study , acquisition part patient 's standard-of-care , would occur independently whether participant enrol ; thus , consider research study visit . No post-surgical follow-up visit part protocol data collection analysis . Patients monitor possible adverse event routine follow-up care operate surgeon involve study procedure , post-operatively subsequently medical record . Hence , information already collect part standard-of-care available adverse event surveillance . Patients receive ALA present abnormally elevate LFTs beyond peri-operative observation period monitor regular basis resolution blood test consider part study . Administration study drug : Patients enrol fluorescein+ALA arm administer orally 5-ALA ( DUSA Pharmaceuticals , Tarrytown , NY ) 20 mg/kg body weight , dissolve 100 ml water , approximately 3 hour prior induction anesthesia . For patient receive fluorescein , operate surgeon request bolus injection ( dose 5 mg/kg ) approximately 30 minute prior start tumor resection . For especially long case ( e.g. , &gt; 4 h ) fluorescein fluorescence dissipate substantially course procedure , second bolus injection may occur later case .</detailed_description>
