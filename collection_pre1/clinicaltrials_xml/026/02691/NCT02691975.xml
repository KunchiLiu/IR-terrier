	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study SHR3680 Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Androgenic signal play pivotal role development prostate cancer . Androgen deprivation therapy mainstay treatment cancer metastatic setting , disease eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) mainly due overexpression androgen receptor ( AR ) continue AR activation . SHR3680 novel strong AR antagonist . By competitively bind AR , SHR3680 inhibit androgen-mediated translocation AR nucleus , bind AR Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) , finally transcription AR target gene , thus possibly result specific strong anti-tumor effect prostate cancer . Unlike first-generation AR antagonist ( e.g . bicalutamide ) , undergoes antagonist-to-agonist switch stimulate AR set AR overexpression CRPC , SHR3680 full antagonist AR thus suppose effective treatment CRPC .</detailed_description>
