	<brief_summary>Rationale : Because long-term use ICS associate increase likelihood side-effects increase risk pneumonia loss bone density , important limit prescription ICS patient clear indication treatment . In addition , avoid unnecessary treatment ICS could reduce burden chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) put healthcare budget . The recently update COPD guideline Dutch college General Practitioners ( NHG ) emphasize importance optimize medical treatment COPD patient limit room use inhaled corticosteroid . Objective : The objective study investigate whether discontinuation inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) patient without clear indication ICS accord current guideline result reduction ICS use without adverse health effect patient involve . Study design : The study pragmatic , cluster , parallel group , non-inferiority trial Dutch general practice follow-up 26 week per patient . Study population : 620 COPD patient confirm chronic airflow obstruction , age â‰¥ 40 yr use ICS least prior 6 month without clear indication . Intervention ( applicable ) : Guided ICS withdrawal optimise COPD management . All study participant ( study arm ) receive recommendation optimal bronchodilator therapy personalize action plan recognize symptom deterioration early stage . Main study parameters/endpoints : Number exacerbation-free week . Secondary study parameter : successful cessation ICS , time first exacerbation , number moderate severe exacerbation , health-related quality life , health status , pneumonia . Moreover , information process care cost collect . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Many COPD patient use ICS without clear indication . Long-term use ICS associate increase likelihood side-effects increase risk pneumonia loss bone density avoid benefit . However , small subgroup COPD patient reduce number exacerbation ICS use impossible identify priori patient applies . Therefore , important ICS discontinuation guide detect potential deterioration early .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>COPD diagnosis medical record ( ICPC code R95 R91 ) ; Most recent spirometry result less three year old show ratio Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) less 0.7 , short : FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.7 ( If recent spirometry result available , patient schedule diagnostic spirometric test ) ; ICS treatment least past 6 month ; Accessible electronic medical record prescription data history least one year ; The subject 's COPD primarily manage general practioner ( GP ) ( i.e. , chest physician ) ; subject 's COPD treat chest physician well , chest physician agree invitation subject . Willing provide write informed consent ; Mentally competent . A spirometry test demonstrate airflow reversibility ( i.e. , postbd FEV1 improvement least 12 % 200 ml compare baseline and/or postbd FEV1 improvement 9 % baseline FEV1 % predict value ) precede initiation ICS treatment ; Diagnosis asthma medical record ( ICPC code R96 ) ; Allergic respiratory disease confirm positive skin prick test specific immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) serum document medical record , combination document history respiratory allergic symptom ; Two exacerbation previous 12 month treat oral corticosteroid , antibiotic , ; and/or require visit emergency care facility hospital admission ; Use oral corticosteroid regular basis ( i.e. , six week previous half year ) reason ; Currently participate another intervention study interfere current study ; Has one serious disease likely lead study dropout ( e.g. , disease limit life expectancy ) influence study result ; Pregnancy woman try conceive child ; Unable read understand Dutch language .</criteria>
