	<brief_summary>This phase II , single arm , open-label , interventional trial pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) subject metastatic locally advanced/unresectable metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour ( MPNST ) . The patient treat pembrolizumab 10 cycle . Primary objective evaluate percentage patient curatively unresectable MPNST achieve clinical response ; complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) 18 week assess Investigator , use RECIST , v1.1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Pembrolizumab Patients With Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor ( MPNST ) , Not Eligible Curative Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients MPNST , eligible surgery curative intent , consider treatment pembrolizumab . Patients receive pembrolizumab treatment 10 cycle . The patient must discontinue study treatment earlier ( 10 cycle pembrolizumab ) experience symptomatic deterioration attribute disease progression , intolerable toxicity relate pembrolizumab , medical condition may jeopardize patient 's safety , use non-protocol anti-cancer therapy pregnancy . Patients receive 10 cycle pembrolizumab discontinue study treatment another reason progression , follow-up period assess safety treatment-related toxicity ( 90 day ) , progression survival . Patients achieve clinical meaningful response 10 cycle pembrolizumab , define complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) assess Investigator use RECIST , v1.1 , experience clinically significant toxicity study treatment , may consider reintroduction pembrolizumab , progression detect cycle 10 . Due low incidence MPNST , inclusion rate expect low , thus Simon 's two-stage design suggest ( see Statistical Analysis Plans - Section 8.0 ) . Evaluation efficacy safety stage one perform first 7 patient treat 18 week : In case responder ; trial end . If one responder , trial continue stage two total number 18 patient include .</detailed_description>
