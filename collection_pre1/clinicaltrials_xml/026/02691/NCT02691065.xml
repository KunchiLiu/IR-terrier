	<brief_summary>Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection damage body defence mainly affect two important white blood cell call cluster differentiation ( CD4 ) T cell monocytes . This immune dysfunction lead persistent inflammation , partially resolve long-term anti-HIV therapy . Importantly , inflammation increase risk cardiovascular , diabetes , kidney disease . The cause inflammation largely unknown include HIV , presence infection , lifestyle characteristic like increase cholesterol level , obesity , smoke alcohol abuse . In addition , inflammation driven certain type anti-HIV therapy call protease inhibitor ( PI ) . PI associate increase cholesterol may contribute inflammation . A new class medication available Canada call integrase inhibitor ( II ) may lesser effect cholesterol level . Therefore , important study effect II cholesterol level inflammation . The purpose study assess inflammatory change , blood person treat PI switch II may remain PI-containing regimen . By compare person continue current PI-based regimen switch II-based regimen , know change PI raltegravir ( Isentress ) , type II , decrease lipid inflammatory marker . The adult person live HIV , PI-based therapy year , CD4 T cell count plasma viral load level detection , invite participate study . 40 study participant select randomization ( like toss coin ) either continue PI-based regimen ( 20 participant ) switch raltegravir-based regimen ( 20 participant ) period 12 month . Blood sample study participant drawn , end study evaluate change marker inflammation , cholesterol level CD4 T cell monocyte function . No experimental anti-HIV medication use ; change therapy include raltegravir one currently recommend medication treat HIV Canada . This study able answer important question whether inflammation decrease switch therapy PI-based therapy raltegravir-based therapy . Ultimately , information provide study contribute health person live HIV .</brief_summary>
