	<brief_summary>Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) common deadly primary malignant neoplasm central nervous system adult . Despite aggressive multimodality treatment approach include surgery , radiation therapy chemotherapy , overall survival remain poor . Novocure show properly tune , low intensity , intermediate frequency electric field ( TTFields ) stunt growth tumor cell . The Optune system ( NovoTTFTM Therapy ) portable battery operate device , produce TTFields within human body mean surface transducer array . The TTFields apply patient mean surface transducer array electrically insulate , resistively couple electric current deliver patient . Optune currently FDA-approved single modality treatment recurrent GBM surgical radiotherapy option exhaust well combination adjuvant temozolomide newly diagnose GBM . This research study perform determine whether TTFields combine pulsed bevacizumab treatment increase overall survival patient bevacizumab-refractory GBM compare historical control treat continuous bevacizumab alone combination chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TTFields Pulsed Bevacizumab Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects evidence bevacizumab-refractory GBM eligible participate research study . Subjects undergo 12 month plan continuous treatment TTFields follow pulsed bevacizumab treatment evidence progression per RANO , option extend treatment total 24 month patient progress and/or adequate performance status 12 month mark . Pulsed bevacizumab dose define least one cycle least one cycle . A cycle define 8 week length . If one cycle , evidence repeat response ; bevacizumab continue one cycle . If two cycle , repeat response ; bevacizumab continue without standard chemotherapy death . If least one cycle , evidence repeat response , bevacizumab discontinue least one cycle progression note per RANO , whichever later , time pulse bevacizumab restart outline . The investigator believe approach produce peak trough mitotic activity glioma cell render glioma cell sensitive antimitotic activity Optune peak growth rate , thus lower disease burden increase survival . In addition , follow perform : Bevacizumab give 10mg/kg IV every 2 week . Physical examination quality life ( QoL ) assessment perform bi-monthly . Brain MRI perform every 2 month .</detailed_description>
