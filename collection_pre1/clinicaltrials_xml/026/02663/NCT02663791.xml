	<brief_summary>Arterial stiffness important marker cardiovascular health . Recent evidence cross-sectional research suggest associated alcohol consumption . Research employ longitudinal perspective may better equip evaluate nature relationship particular determine whether alcohol consumption link progression arterial stiffness time . The current study consequently implement longitudinal cohort design evaluate association long-term alcohol consumption pattern change arterial stiffness . Data drawn Whitehall II cohort study British civil servant , participant complete repeat pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) assessments arterial stiffness across four-to-five year interval . Repeat measurement volume alcohol intake also record participant , extend back across two decade . Intake categorise way distinguish different alcohol consumer type , include non-drinkers former drinker . Linear mixed effect model use adjustment potential confounds , age , diabetes , mean arterial pressure heart rate . Results model work illustrate extent form association alcohol intake PWV . This work provide useful insight role alcohol intake play longitudinal progression important cardiac marker , implication understand alcohol 's relationship cardiovascular health general population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alcohol Consumption Arterial Stiffness : A Longitudinal Study Pulse Wave Velocity Whitehall II Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arterial stiffness occur vessel wall lack elasticity . It know independently associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality , act surrogate end point study cardiovascular disease . Pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) index stiffness describe 'gold standard ' measurement . A number clinical factor find show meaningful association PWV , include heart rate mean arterial pressure . These finding highlight need study new potential determinant PWV account potentially confounding influence know factor . Additional demographic lifestyle characteristic also show act moderator PWV . In particular , research demonstrate PWV increase age , stiffness consequently deem indicator vascular ageing . Alcohol intake another lifestyle characteristic consider potential factor loss arterial elasticity . Evidence date suggest J-shaped association may exist intake PWV , work mostly rely cross-sectional data look short-term intake pattern . By adopt longitudinal perspective , insight may garner important epidemiological issue . Consequently , new study herein propose address research need investigate different pattern alcohol consumption relate arterial stiffness progression stiffness time . The primary objective study ( 1 ) examine whether long-term pattern alcohol consumption independently associate baseline assessment carotid-femoral PWV ( 2 ) whether alcohol intake likewise associate longitudinal change important cardiovascular marker . Longitudinal alcohol exposure determine report consumption phase 1 ( 1985-1988 ) 9 ( 2007-2009 ) Whitehall II Cohort Study categorise accord late UK recommendation alcohol intake limit . These guideline define moderate consumption weekly ethanol intake volume 112g male female . As alcohol consumption record UK unit Whitehall II database , conversion perform use standard ratio 1 unit 8 gram ethanol prior categorisation . The subsequent categorisation draw distinction non-drinkers former drinker , well moderate heavy consumer . Those unstable pattern consumption also identify emerge evidence consumer may different cardiovascular risk profile compare consumer longitudinally consistent intake pattern . Demographic clinical characteristic investigate provide context subsequent inferential analysis . As research also suggest participant sex moderate relationship alcohol PWV , test current analysis ( preliminary modelling include sex part interaction term level alcohol consumption ) . If moderation effect replicate , core result report stratify accord sex . Linear mixed effect model use examine effect long-term alcohol consumption PWV effect subsequent longitudinal change cardiovascular marker . This modelling approach particularly suit analyse complex data structure investigation , include correlation across individual participant ' pair measurement . A detailed analytic protocol available upon request . Supplementary linear mixed effect model also perform look association short-term alcohol consumption pattern PWV . This employ modelling strategy use primary analysis , categorisation consumption utilise report intake recent assessment phase . This supplementary analysis offer additional context finding primary analysis provide detail relationship different form alcohol consumption arterial stiffness . Through comprehensive detailed analysis , hop new insight important issue cardiovascular health obtain .</detailed_description>
