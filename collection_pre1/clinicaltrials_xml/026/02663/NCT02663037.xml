	<brief_title>Simple Segmentation Tool Understand Elderly Health Status Needs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In context young population , Singapore establish superb system care , focus largely acute hospital specialty service . This addressed need dominantly young population , usually acute self-limited , associate asymptomatic risk , occasionally relate single disable life-limiting condition . As population age , need health relate social service change individual shift complex stage , multiple condition , loss resilience , late decline ; address need associate stage less amenable acute care , disease-centric approach . The need old population way similar young population ( though generally great likelihood degree ) ; however , elderly require different strategy support later stag life . For example : - For chronic asymptomatic risk factor , elderly may less benefited screening , definitive testing , treatment ; - Elders may less likely risk factor identify successfully manage ; - Elders may unidentified symptomatic , treatable condition ( e.g. , cataract ) ; - Social issue , family support social network may dominant effect introduction , use success medical intervention ; - Elders experience loss resilience may occur without anyone aware , self-reinforcement lead frank frailty ( e.g. , phenotype physiological state loss reserve multiple system ) ; - Though end life issue unique elder , support old people late stage life-limiting condition present distinctive feature , require different set service ; - The high increasing use acute service elderly ; volume proportion number ) may point opportunity care elder complex stage health effectively , humanely , sustainably . The primary aim study validate Simple Segmentation Tool ( SST ) method patient population segmentation term inter-rater reliability , well convergent validity predictive validity . Design SST 1 . To address expand need elderly , important take person-centric approach , tailor service individual . From health system perspective , present challenge least two reason . First , health system service focus site care thus one may miss opportunity alleviate progression complex stage , high morbidity cost . Second , implement excessively tailor program extremely expensive health system perspective , especially hospital-based . To address challenge , investigator propose population segmentation approach . This entail assign category health associate social feature characterize `` package '' intervention aim alleviate progression symptomatic/higher risk category , improve quality life . This approach advocate internationally ( Hewner &amp; Seo , 2014 ; Van Der Laan , Van Offenbeek , Broekhuis , &amp; J. , 2014 ; Zhou , Wong , &amp; Li , 2014 ) , follow foundational work Lynne et al ( Lynn , Straube , Bell , Jencks , &amp; Kambic , 2007 ) . Population segmentation recognize wide diversity among people individualized approach care , understand prototypical need powerful tool purpose plan evaluation health social service . 2 . The Simple Segmentation Tool design facilitate segmentation age Singapore population facilitate provision cost-effective person-centric care . Specifically , tool facilitates capture meso-level medical need complicate factor patient classify say patient one 7 medical category one 3 care complexity level . A healthcare need context SST define potential benefit healthcare whereupon benefit understood reduction probability patient transition bad clinical state experience adverse clinical outcome . Meanwhile , type need SST capture normative need need patient assess clinician . The 7 medical global impression patient SST adapt original 8 base `` Bridges Health '' model Joanne Lynn et al ( Lynn et al. , 2007 ) order well suit evaluation elderly population . Patients classify one 7 health category namely 1 ) Healthy , 2 ) Acutely ill curable , 3 ) Chronic condition , asymptomatic , 4 ) Chronic condition , stable , 5 ) Long course decline , 6 ) Limited reserve serious exacerbation 7 ) Short period decline die ; best characterize salient clinical need medium long term ( month year ) . With exception category `` Acutely ill curable '' patient assign one category point time . The complicate factor section SST design measure degree need 8 different healthcare relevant characteristic . These characteristic select base significance towards patient management transitional point care . They follow : 1 ) functional assessment , 2 ) social support case need , 3 ) hospital admission last 6 month , 4 ) disruptive behavioral issue , 5 ) polypharmacy , 6 ) organization care , 7 ) activation care , 8 ) skilled nursing type task need . Decline ADL function ( Buurman , Parlevliet , Van Deelen , De Haan , &amp; De Rooij , 2010 ) recent unplanned hospital readmission ( L. W. &amp; C. K. W. , 1999 ) know precede unplanned hospital readmission . On hand , social support enhance individual 's ability cope stressor , promote health-seeking behavior , also provide basic healthcare service ( Glanz , Rimer , &amp; Viswanath , 2008 ) . Disruptive behavioral issue important characterize cause significant caregiver stress ( Ahn &amp; Horgas , 2013 ) . Complex medication management plan due polypharmacy ( Cameli et al. , 2012 ) multiple healthcare provider confusion ( Services , 2010 ) important recognize prevent iatrogenic harm patient . Finally , degree patient activation ( Mosen et al. , 2007 ) well successful management geriatric syndrome ( Van Craen et al. , 2010 ) present also important determinant elderly health . Depending high level social healthcare need identify patient , follow complexity category assign . For example , high level social healthcare need identify 1 Polypharmacy , patient thus deem moderately complex . Complexity understood `` interference standard care '' ( Peek , Baird , &amp; Coleman , 2009 ) . Increased complexity patient increase probability failure medical intervention hence need recognize mitigate order improve clinical outcome . The SST design use outpatient set . Clinicians train use expect first ass patient part routine clinical assessment use SST categorize patient . By keep number input required clinician brief succinct , hop utilization SST integrate well usual clinic operational flow . 3 . Validation Improvement SST As SST novel tool , need psychometrically validate use segment patient population various site provision healthcare.There various benefit associate successful validation tool propose manner : Inter-rater reliability : Validation would allow u assess interchangeability potential user tool heterogenous patient population ( Gwet , 2010 ) . If investigator able establish interchangeability clinician different background experience senior doctor , nurse even medical student , investigator may able easily operationalize tool since medical personnel able reliably administer . Convergent validity : Validation would allow u verify two measure construct theoretically relate , fact relate ( Trochim , 2006 ) . Demonstration convergent validity SST pair widely accept validated pre-existing tool allow u gain reasonable confidence ability tool capture similar construct . Predictive validity : Validation SST use predict future health status healthcare utilization pattern unplanned readmission discharge would increase SST 's utility shaping intervention target high readmission risk individual bid low risk unplanned hospital readmission . Based result validation study , SST modify make optimally robust subsequent patient segmentation study various site care . For example , specific section SST low inter-rater reliability convergent validity modify improve tool 's psychometric property . SST Benefit 1 - Identification leverage point intervention . Through cross-sectional longitudinal study patient profile term medical social healthcare need use SST , area characterize high healthcare need detect various site care thus allow implementation health service intervention order well meet healthcare need . Furthermore , longitudinal study would allow determination risk factor associate increased transition rate low high severity global impression patient category thus also facilitate target follow intervention study . Health service reorganization well meet area high healthcare need would lead improved clinical outcome reduction probability clinical complication . In context ageing population would help keep elderly healthy functional long period time thus reduce healthcare cost associate exacerbation chronic disease . SST Benefit 2 - Greater accountability . Better identification area healthcare need allow well comparison need clinical infrastructure service provide allow great accountability delivery healthcare . Services meet identify need scale reduce healthcare cost . Resources financial manpower alike divert towards area great need . SST Benefit 3 - Packages care . Understanding common combination population medical need complicate factor would allow package care develop designed common prototypical patient easily modify suit individual patient . Such approach would allow effective resource plan capitation bundling purpose , well integrate delivery healthcare intervention patient .</detailed_description>
