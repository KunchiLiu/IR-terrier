	<brief_summary>Background . Limberg flap , one recently popularize off-midline closure technique , widely perform treatment sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus ; however , recurrence still see . Objective . The aim study ass relationship recurrence off-midline closure error make Limberg flap reconstruction . Design . A multicenter , matched-case-control study conduct three participate center Turkey . Settings . Each hospital 's database search separately patient without recurrence underwent LF surgery primary SPS January 2008 July 2015 identify . Patients . Sixty patient recurrent disease ( recurrent group , RG ) 120 matched case recurrence-free patient least 5 year follow surgery ( non-recurrent group , NRG ) include study . Interventions Main outcome measure . According off-midline closure concept , LF reconstruction classify incorrect closure ( Type 1 , 2 3 ) correct closure ( type 4 , 5 6 ) . Then two group analyze .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Off-midline Closure Errors Risk Factor Recurrence Following Limberg Flap Patients With Pilonidal Sinus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sacrococcygeal Pilonidal sinus ( SPS ) common disorder estimate incidence 1.1 % community 9 % soldier . Pilonidal disease function hair x force x vulnerability skin , theory purpose Karydakis article 1992 , hair follicle obstruction enlargement , assertion Bascom widely accept explanation etio-pathogenesis disease . It disease , still clear consensus regard gold-standard treatment modality , even though lot research publication . However , recently off-midline closure technique popularize , suture line position midline ensure minimal chance recurrence . One techniques rhomboid , Limberg , flap ( LF ) widely perform flap surgery treatment SPS Turkey . However , recurrence see follow wide excision LF reconstruction ; therefore , successful implementation LF technique sacrococcygeal area require well-known characteristic flap problematic anatomy gluteal cleft . There many report favor Limberg flap others . Although author also use perform LF patient SPS acceptable result 2008 , shift routine surgical preference another off-midline closure technique cosmetic reason date . But increasingly case administer institution due complication recurrence LF perform elsewhere . Therefore author decide investigate technical reason risk factor problem avoid complication recurrence relate incorrect flap design . The author first hypothesize association erroneous off-midline closure recurrence patient underwent LF reconstruction primary SPS . Then design case-control study test hypothesis .</detailed_description>
