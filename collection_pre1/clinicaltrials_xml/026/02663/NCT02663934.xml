	<detailed_description>Management old person live HIV ( PLWH ) ( ≥ 50 year old ) become increasingly complex majority great 50 year old . Attempts improve quality life old PLWH use adjunctive therapeutic combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) largely unsuccessful . While impact physical activity brain health ( assessed neuropsychological performance neuroimaging ) well study old healthy HIV uninfected ( HIV- ) individual neurodegenerative condition , study concentrate old PLWH . Both clinically pathophysiologically , HIV associate neurocognitive disorder ( HAND ) differs neurodegenerative disorder see age ( e.g . Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . A positive association relationship exercise cognition observe PLWH , physical activity primarily examine use self-report questionnaire subjective quantitative . To date , study focus direct effect exercise neuropsychological performance neuroimaging PLWH . The objective proposal conduct prospective control intervention trial determine increase physical activity monitor aerobic resistance exercise ( EXS ) program improve brain health old PLWH . We quantify physical function ( physical activity use cardiorespiratory capacity actigraphy ) brain function [ neuropsychological performance test neuroimaging ( cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) brain volume ) ] old physically inactive PLWH baseline 26 week randomization either EXS social-interaction stretching ( SIS ) program . In addition , obtain stool sample , serum marker neurogenesis , glucose regulation , systemic inflammation . A direct impact expect outcomes adoption physically active lifestyle old PLWH improve EXS guideline program old PLWH .</detailed_description>
