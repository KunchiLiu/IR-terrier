	<brief_title>The Impact Low-fat Full-fat Dairy Consumption Glucose Homeostasis ( DAIRY Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled feeding trial design investigate whether consumption diet rich low-fat dairy vs. full-fat dairy vs. limited dairy diet differentially affect glucose homeostasis . The researcher also begin investigation mechanism dairy may affect glucose tolerance determinant . The investigator study 60 men woman metabolic syndrome consume diet differ type content dairy food , parallel-design randomize controlled trial consist 4-week wash-in diet period 12-week dietary intervention period . Subjects randomize use block randomization stratify gender insulin resistance ( low insulin resistance vs. high insulin resistance manifest diabetes ) one three diet group , follow 12 week : limited dairy diet , low-fat dairy diet , full-fat dairy diet . During dietary intervention , participant provide specific amount type dairy product Human Nutrition Lab ( HNL ) Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ( FHCRC ) . In limited dairy diet arm , participant ask consume dairy , three serving nonfat milk per week , provide . In two dairy diet arm , participant ask consume 3.3 serving per day either nonfat/low-fat full-fat milk , yogurt , cheese . Participants ask consume dairy product receive , consume dairy product 12 week , continue consume habitual diet ad libitum ( i.e. , eat hungry , stop eating comfortably satiate ) . Prior randomization , subject complete wash-in diet period 4 week ask consume limit dairy diet ( i.e. , consume 3 serving nonfat milk per week , consume dairy product ) . In third week wash-in diet period , subject also complete first two 5-day control feeding period ( i.e. , consume study dairy product alongside provide standard American diet ) measure ad libitum energy intake . During last week wash-in diet period , participant admit clinic baseline visit ( clinic visit # 1 ) . After clinic visit # 1 , subject randomize one three study arm , outline . They follow randomly assign study diet next 12 week . In second week main intervention period , subject complete second 5-day control feeding period measure ad libitum energy intake , time specific intervention diet randomize . In last week 12-week diet phase , subject admit follow-up clinic visit ( clinic visit # 2 ) . At clinic visit , researcher collect fast blood ; measure body weight height , waist hip circumference , blood pressure ; conduct 3-hour FS-OGTT ass glucose tolerance , insulin sensitivity , pancreatic beta-cell function ; conduct whole-body DEXA scan ass body fat mass , lean mass , body fat distribution ; abdominal MRI scan ass liver triglyceride content ratio intra-abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue . Subjects also complete five Food Frequency Questionnaires ( FFQ 's ) five unannounced 24-hour dietary recall study assess dietary intake . The primary analysis per protocol analysis include least 60 participant ( least 20 intervention arm ) comply study procedure per protocol . The investigator anticipate enrol 72 participant achieve goal . In secondary analysis , researcher analyze impact dietary intervention enrol participant , include drop , exclude , non-compliant study protocol , intent-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis report interpreted together per protocol analysis .</detailed_description>
