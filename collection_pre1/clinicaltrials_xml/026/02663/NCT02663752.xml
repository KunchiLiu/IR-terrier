	<brief_summary>Several previous study ( clinical non-clinical ) hypothesize treatment deferasirox cause hematological improvement transfuse patient low intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome . The purpose study assess presence genetic biomarkers predictive hematologic response use gene expression profile bone marrow aspirate obtain MDS patient without hematological response .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written inform consent obtain prior study procedure , Males females ≥ 18 year age , MDS accord WHO criteria last ≥ 14 week time screening , IPSS score &lt; 1.5 ( low intermediate1 risk patient ) time screen use IPSS score 1997 Treatment deferasirox : Only responder group : Treatment deferasirox prevention treatment IOL least 14 week screen . Only nonresponder group : Treatment deferasirox least 9 month prevention treatment IOL screen exclude patient late hematological response . Only respondergroup : Patient hematological response define accord IWG criterion 2006 must last least 8 week , confirm scientific advisory committee . In case hematological response identify retrospectively , confirmation base last available blood result show hematological response accord IWG criterion 2006 . In case , archive bone marrow sample moment response available order eligible . This archive bone marrow take moment hematological response present least 8 week still ongoing moment sampling , accord IWG criterion 2006 order eligible . When bone marrow sample take hematological response already disappear , sample eligible analysis . Only nonresponder group : confirmation scientific advisory committee patient eligible base matchedpairing confirmation hematological response . Minimal requirement match pair include age , sex , IPSS score , hemoglobin level , transfusion need baseline , treatment duration deferasirox time since MDS diagnosis . Pairing extend accord level leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , serum ferritin level baseline , comorbidities transfusion history . More detail pair describe protocol . In case nonresponder identify retrospectively archival bone marrow available documented time nonresponse , use analysis . In case , interval 4 week blood sample documentation nonresponse bone marrow sample allow . Bone marrow aspirate/RNA take time MDS diagnosis ( baseline ) retrievable patient 's hospital . This check treat hematologist/oncologist refer patient potential inclusion study . This aspirate/RNA preserve right circumstance order ensure quality RNA . The sample frozen viably , mean control rate freeze addition protector dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO preserve 80°C . Preservation cell lysed lysis buffer upon arrival lab , store 20°C RNAextraction also useful study . Known concomitant presence anemia due iron , B12 folate deficiency , autoimmune hereditary hemolysis , gastrointestinal bleeding medication induce anemia time screening , Known infection viral hepatitis B ( HBV ) viral hepatitis C ( HCV ) define presence blood HBV antigens absence HB antibody , presence HCV antibody time screening , Known history positivity human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) measure enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) western blot time screening , Patient participate another clinical trial receive investigational drug time screen within 1 month prior study inclusion History malignancy within last five year , exception basal skin carcinoma cervical carcinoma situ completely resect colonic polyp carcinoma situ Concomitant treatment drug know suspect elicit hematological response . ( azacitidine , hematopoietic growth factor , granulocyte colony stimulate factor , valproate , lenalidomide , thalidomide , ATG , cyclosporine , arsenic trioxide ) .When patient still receive red blood cell transfusion , patient still eligible study inclusion long meet IWG criterion 2006 Female patient pregnant breast feed</criteria>
