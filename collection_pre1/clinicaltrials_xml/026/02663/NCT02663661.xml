	<brief_summary>The type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) TrialNet Pathway To Prevention ( PTP ) Study assess recruit at-risk subject clinical trial aim prevent development full blown T1D . Thousands first second degree relative person T1D screen autoimmune abnormality positive subject follow metabolic autoantibody test . The investigator ' ancillary study u design test whether characterization insulin- glucose-glucagon ( IGG ) interaction participant PTP study provide new information early stage disease . When complete , study improve understand pathogenesis early stage T1D provide new quantitative tool prediction evaluation insulin-glucagon-glucose interaction relevant individual risk develop T1D , thereby enable future preventive intervention trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal propose ancillary study establish whether characterization insulin-glucagon-glucose ( IGG ) interaction first second degree relatives patient type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) provide new information pathogenesis , prediction , progression early stage disease . The project enroll individual `` Living Biobank '' TrialNet Pathway Prevention ( PTP ) study phenotyped respect variety risk factor , include immunological abnormality . To best available knowledge , IGG relationships general glucagon phenotype particular study population . It know , however , T1D release glucagon alter , manifest abnormal postprandial suppression defective response hypoglycemia . Several report indicate glucagon becomes dysregulated prior development T1D , comprehensive study aim understand detail insulin-glucagon co-dynamics people risk T1D never perform . Thus , goal expand investigator ' exist methodology transfer expertise clinical test analysis IGG system characterize IGG interaction individual risk develop T1D .</detailed_description>
