	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial target 248 community-dwelling old adult impaired mobility ( i.e . walk slowly ; gait speed &lt; 1.20 m/s ) . The trial compare 12 week `` standard-plus '' program strength , endurance , flexibility plus task specific time coordination train standard 12 week strength , endurance flexibility program . The primary outcome gait speed 12 week . Secondary tertiary outcome represent component intervention measure activity participation . Delayed sustain effect intervention examine 24 36 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Task Specific Timing Coordination Exercise Improve Mobility Older Adults : Program Improve Mobility Aging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Walking difficulty common costly old adult . While traditional exercise show promote physical mental health may prevent walk difficulty , exercise focus strength endurance , overlook critical component walk ability ; time coordination movement . Aging disease alter time coordination reflect slowed neuromotor performance , increase gait variability reduce smoothness movement . Task specific time coordination exercise include practice smooth coordinate aspect gait multiple walking condition potential improve walk ability great standard program . Our preliminary data suggest intervention time coordination gait impact mobility great standard strength endurance program . The next key step objective proposal combine two intervention determine potential gain mobility , activity participation obtain standard plus timing coordination program , large gain obtained standard program alone . Therefore , primary aim propose project evaluate impact add time coordination train standard strength endurance training mobility . Secondary aim include examine 1 ) additional outcome represent component intervention measure activity participation , 2 ) delay sustain effect intervention , 3 ) effect intervention within various subgroups interest . This randomized clinical trial 248 community-dwelling old adult walk slowly ( i.e . &lt; 1.20 m/s ) compare standard 12 week strength , endurance flexibility program 12 week `` standard-plus '' program strength , endurance , flexibility plus task specific time coordination training . The primary outcome gait speed 12 week . We also examine secondary tertiary outcome represent component intervention measure activity participation delay sustain effect 24 36 week . The finding efficacy trial provide evidence add value task specific time coordination train promote walk ability old adult form basis future effectiveness trial . Future work include translation nonprofessional exercise leader long-term goal incorporate neurological train standard exercise program health promotion old adult .</detailed_description>
