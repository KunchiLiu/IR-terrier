The strategy increase competence primary care professional improve health care mainly prompt current context limited resource restrict access specialty care . This study aim evaluate effectiveness cost-effectiveness integral intervention carry primary care professional follow component : 1. detection patient poor diabetic control ; 2. introduction specific consultation diabetes follow virtual telephone specialist support ; 3. introduction measure overcome patient professional barrier treatment . The main objective study determine glycaemic control measure mean concentration HbA1c poorly control patient improve patient evaluate treated primary care integral strategy propose study .
