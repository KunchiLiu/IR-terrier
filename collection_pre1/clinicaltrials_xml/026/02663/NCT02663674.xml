	<detailed_description>This Phase IV randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study 1000 individual , age 18 year old , community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) meet eligibility criterion endemic region . This study design provide data effectiveness early antifungal treatment ( Fluconazole , 400 mg/day ) coccidioidomycosis pneumonia ( also refer Valley Fever ( VF ) Pneumonia acute onset valley fever ) vs. placebo subject coccidioidomycosis pneumonia . Patients prescribed antibacterial health care provider acute CAP randomize receive either placebo 400 mg/day fluconazole 42 day . Blood work serologic determination coccidioidomycosis infection drawn time randomization ( Day 1 ) , Days 15 , 22 , 29 . On Day 43 , subject inform coccidioidomycosis status treatment assignment . Those receive placebo coccidioidomycosis negative dismiss study Day 43 visit ; coccidioidomycosis positive refer health care provider result serology test treatment assignment treatment indicated return follow-up visit Days 90 180 . Those receive fluconazole coccidioidomycosis negative remain study additional 6 day safety follow-up ; coccidioidomycosis positive refer healthcare provider result serology test treatment assignment treatment indicated return Days 90 180 contacted via phone Day 49 . The study duration approximately 72 month , subject participant duration 42 day approximately 6 month . The primary clinical outcome time achieve clinical response base sign symptom pneumonia via FLEET CAP score Day 22 . Secondary outcome measure include time clinical response among subject coccidioidomycosis pneumonia Day 43 ; mean , median quartile individual component composite symptom score evaluable point duration study period ; mean , median quartile response individual item composite Extra-Pulmonary Symptom Scores absence disseminate disease ; time miss work school SF-12v2 incidence rate all-cause mortality hospitalization among subject coccidioidomycosis pneumonia .</detailed_description>
