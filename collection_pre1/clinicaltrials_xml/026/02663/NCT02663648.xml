	<brief_summary>This study involve observe level cell cycle regulatory gene patient myeloproliferative disorder ( MPD ) . These disorder include polycythemia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) , myelofibrosis ( MF ) chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . The abnormal blood and/or bone marrow cell , material derive abnormal cell , like DNA , RNA , protein plasma use laboratory study . Cell cycle regulatory protein cyclins , cyclin-dependent kinase ( Cdks ) Cdk inhibitor ( CKIs ) play indispensable role process transcription , metabolism stem cell self-renewal . MPD group diseases characterize abnormally increased proliferation erythroid , megakaryocytic , granulocytic cell . The pathogenesis still unclear . Detecting level cell cycle regulatory protein useful look possible role MPD good understand cause MPD .</brief_summary>
