	<brief_summary>Alzheimer´s disease ( AD ) one important cause dementia pose considerable challenge health care . Today , criterion diagnosis follow patient AD mainly rely either subjective test invasive method . This limit general applicability latter test population screen underline need identification easily accessible tool identification high-risk subject . Because unique optical property , eye offer possibility non-invasive assessment structural functional alteration neuronal tissue . As neuro-retina part brain , come surprise neuro-degenerative change brain accompanied structural possibly also functional change neuro-retina ocular vasculature . The current study seek test hypothesis beside know anatomical change , also functional change detect retina patient AD . For purpose , flicker light induce hyperemia measure retina functional test ass couple neural activity blood flow . Further , structural parameter retinal nerve fiber layer thickness function parameter ocular blood flow retinal oxygenation assess compare age sex match control .</brief_summary>
