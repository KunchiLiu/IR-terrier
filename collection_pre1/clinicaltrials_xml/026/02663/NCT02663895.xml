Safety : During study , primary assessment safety change vital sign , clinical laboratory parameter , EKG , development adverse event . 9 . Safety monitor report Definitions : Adverse Event ( AE ) : An AE untoward medical experience occur subject clinical trial whether related study drug . An AE may include intercurrent illness , injury , concomitant impairment subject 's health , well abnormal laboratory finding deem clinical significance . AEs may also include worsen exist symptom condition post-treatment event occur result protocol-mandated procedure . Severe Adverse Event ( SAE ) : A SAE AE occur dose result follow outcome : - Death - A life-threatening AE - Inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization - A persistent significant disability / incapacity - A congenital anomaly / birth defect In addition , important medical event may result death , life-threatening , require hospitalization may consider serious , base upon appropriate medical judgment , may jeopardize subject require medical / surgical intervention prevent one outcomes list . Examples medical event include allergic bronchospasm require intensive treatment emergency room home , blood dyscrasia convulsion result hospitalization , development drug dependency drug abuse . Life threaten mean subject , view Investigator , immediate risk death event occur . It mean event , occur severe form , might cause death . Reporting Responsibilities : In event adverse event , first concern safety patient . Investigators require collect document adverse event ( AEs ) non-related serious adverse event ( SAEs ) . All SAEs , regardless expectedness causality , must report Sponsor fax ( + 1 919-313-1297 appropriate number ) within 24 hour awareness . A complete SAE report form along relevant hospital record autopsy report fax Drug Safety Department United Therapeutics Corporation . A follow-up SAE report form must forward Drug Safety Department United Therapeutics Corporation within 48 hour receipt new / updated information . The Investigator must also promptly notify Investigational Review Board ( IRB ) Ethics Committee ( EC ) SAE , include follow-up information , accordance applicable national regulation guideline set forth IRB EC . All document relate AEs ( serious , non serious , related , ) readily available review , need arise . An AE SAE occur study must document subject 's source document appropriate CRF page . Information relate AE onset cessation date time , intensity , seriousness , relationship study drug , outcome also document CRF . Where possible , AEs record use standard medical terminology . If several sign symptom clearly relate medically define diagnosis syndrome , diagnosis syndrome record CRF page , individual sign symptom . All AEs follow either resolution ( return normal baseline value ) , judge Investigator longer clinically significant , least 4 week AE extend beyond final visit . All SAEs occur study follow resolution , death , subject lose follow-up even ongoing 4 week completion final visit . Supplemental measurement / evaluation may necessary investigate fully nature / causality AE SAE . This may include additional laboratory test , diagnostic procedure , consultation healthcare professional . CRF page update . 10 . Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis : Descriptive statistic frequency distribution variables interest report proportion ( % ) categorical variable mean ± standard deviation median ( range ) continuous variable . Baseline 12 month difference 95 % confidence interval calculate score outcome ( x-ray score , MRSS , physician 's global assessment VAS , quality life measurement ) . For primary efficacy endpoint , mean change standard deviation calcinosis burden assess radiograph baseline 12-month visit , investigator use Student 's t-test . The mean rate change calcinosis radiograph calculate follow formula : ( Year 1 XR score - Baseline XR score ) /time . XR score define : sum score 22 weighted area affect hand : % area coverage ( 0-100 ) X density ( 1-3 ) X weight area . Sample size calculation : The investigator need 9 pair radiograph ( 9 patient ) 1-year provide &gt; 80 % power detect mean change x-ray score 12.0 ( equivalent minimally significant change score 25 % ) SD 8.2 moderate correlation r=0.5 use two-sided test alpha 0.05 level . The investigator estimate 15 % dropout rate base prior clinical trial . Hence , total number subject need obtain 9/0.85 subject complete study 11 subject . Also , due small sample size , investigator plan use Wilcoxon sign rank test analyze effect . Thus , investigator anticipate lose 10 % power due use non-parametric test . As result , sample size adjust 11/0.9 = 12 . Statistical significance define p ≤ 0.05 .</detailed_description>
