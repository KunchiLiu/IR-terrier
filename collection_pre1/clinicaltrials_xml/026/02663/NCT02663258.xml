	<detailed_description>This single arm , single agent , open label , exploratory translational research study patient unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma treat Pembrolizumab . Suitable patient undergo serial surgical core biopsy ( nonradiological ) subcutaneous lymph node metastasis ( judged Oncological Surgical Consultant ) . As primary endpoint , investigator assess safety feasibility undergo biopsy within patient cohort . A total forty patient recruited period two year . Patients provide consent satisfied eligibility criterion undergo baseline CT scan peripheral blood sampling . At baseline , biopsy suitable metastatic lesion undertaken sample send histopathological assessment analysis molecular immune parameter . Participants treat Pembrolizumab , 200mg , intravenously , every 3 week . At 6 week follow commencement Pembrolizumab therapy , biopsy excision metastatic disease perform , unless consider longer possible basis near complete response treatment . Blood sampling perform prior cycle repeat CT scan occur every 9 week . Response evaluation perform accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . Pembrolizumab continue long study participant derive benefit biopsy progress lesion perform possible . The investigator aim evaluate safety feasibility obtain serial tumour biopsy excisions metastatic disease treatment Pembrolizumab exploration ) mechanistic activity Pembrolizumab , ii ) identification intratumoural peripheral factor limit response , iii ) identification candidate predictive biomarker panel base ( ) ( ii ) iii ) use circulate free DNA ( cfDNA ) surrogate marker response guide duration therapy .</detailed_description>
