	<brief_summary>The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease : antibody T cell . Antibodies proteins protect body disease cause bacteria toxic substance . Antibodies work bind bacteria substance , stop grow cause bad effect . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include tumor cell cell infect . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer . They show promise , neither alone sufficient cure patient . This study design combine T cell antibody create effective treatment . The treatment research call autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cell target CD30 antigen ( ATLCAR.CD30 ) administration . In previous study , show new gene put T cell increase ability recognize kill cancer cell . A gene unit DNA . Genes make chemical structure carry patient 's genetic information may determine human characteristic ( i.e. , eye color , height sex ) . The new gene put T cell study make piece antibody call anti-CD30 . This antibody float around blood detect stick cancer cell call lymphoma cell substance outside cell call CD30 . Anti-CD30 antibody use treat people lymphoma , strong enough cure patient . For study , anti-CD30 antibody change instead float free blood part join T cell . Only part antibody stick lymphoma cell attach T cell instead entire antibody . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . These CD30 chimeric ( combination ) receptor-activated T cell seem kill tumor , last long body chance fight cancer unknown . The purpose research study determine safe dose ATLCAR.CD30 cell give subject undergo autologous transplant . This first step determine whether give ATLCAR.CD30 cell others lymphoma future help . The researcher also want find side effect patient receive ATLCAR.CD30 cell post-transplant . This study also look effect ATLCAR.CD30 cell , include effect cancer long survive body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective - To determine safety tolerability estimate MTD ATLCAR.CD30 post ASCT patient CD30+ lymphoma high risk relapse Secondary Objectives - To measure survival ATLCAR.CD30 vivo - To estimate PFS infusion ATLCAR.CD30 post ASCT patient CD30+ lymphoma high risk relapse - To determine overall survival infusion ATLCAR.CD30 post ASCT patient CD30+ lymphoma high risk relapse ENDPOINTS Primary Endpoint - Toxicity classify grade accord National Cancer Institute 's Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE , version 4.0 ) . The MTD base rate dose-limiting toxicity Secondary ( Clinical ) Endpoint - PFS define day ASCT relapse ( patient document complete response ASCT ) progression ( patient document stable disease partial response ASCT ) , death result cause per Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma - Overall survival measure date administration CAR.CD30 transduce ATL date death OUTLINE Patients schedule undergo autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) treatment lymphoma approach consent screen potential enrollment LCCC1524 . Peripheral blood cell collect consent patient meet eligibility cell procurement creation ATLCAR.CD30 cell prior ASCT . The ASCT , include mobilization collection PBSCs , administration myeloablative therapy , reinfusion PBSCs supportive care follow transplant per routine standard care , expect impacted enrollment LCCC1524 . Post ASCT , patient meet eligibility criterion treatment receive one infusion ATLCAR.CD30 cell evidence hematologic recovery . Research personnel keep track patient undergo procurement undergo treatment ATLCAR.CD30 cell , reason withhold treatment . Cell Procurement Peripheral blood , 300 mL total ( 3 collection ) obtain subject cell procurement . In patient low ( CD3 count assay flow cytometry le 200/μl ) T-cell count peripheral blood , leukopheresis may perform isolate sufficient T cell . The parameter pheresis 2 blood volume . For pediatric patient ( patient 18 year age ) , total amount blood drawn 3 mL ( le 1 teaspoon per 2.2 lb . child weighs . ATLCAR.CD30 Cells Administration Post ASCT , patient start experience hematologic recovery ( define ANC ≥500 cells/mm3 3 consecutive day , AND platelet count ≥25 cells/mm3 without transfusion precede 5 day , AND Hg ≥8g/dL without transfusion support precede 5 day ) , . This generally occur 14 20 day follow infusion autologous stem cell follow high-dose chemotherapy . Duration Therapy Therapy LCCC1524 involve one infusion ATLCAR.CD30 cell . Treatment one infusion administer unless : - Patient decide withdraw study treatment , OR - General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator . Duration Follow-Up Patients follow 15 year death , whichever occur first . Patients remove study unacceptable adverse event follow resolution stabilization adverse event .</detailed_description>
