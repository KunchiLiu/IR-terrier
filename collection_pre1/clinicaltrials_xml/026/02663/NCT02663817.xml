	<brief_title>DMH-Based Plan Evaluation Inverse Optimization Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer patient continue represent challenge disease population , face rather poor prognosis current treatment planning delivery practice . Venues potential dose escalation and/or increase healthy tissue sparing , innovative therapeutic approach patient , clearly need . Current state art radiotherapy treatment plan relies dose-volume-histogram ( DVH ) paradigm , dose fractional ( often ) absolute volume anatomical structure employ optimization plan evaluation process . It argue however , effect deliver dose seem closely relate healthy tissue toxicity ( thereby clinical outcome ) dose-mass-histograms ( DMHs ) consider treatment plan evaluation . The investigator propose incorporation mass density information explicitly cost function inverse optimization process , thereby shift DVH DMH treatment planning paradigm . This novel DMH-based intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) optimization aim minimization radiation dose certain mass , rather volume , healthy tissue . The investigator ' work hypothesis DMH- optimization reduce dose healthy tissue substantially . In certain case , extensive , difficult treat disease , low dose healthy tissue use isotoxic dose escalation , may result increase estimate loco-regional tumor control probability . To test study hypothesis , investigator pursue follow specific aim : - ( 1 ) Develop theoretical computational framework DMH-based IMRT optimization . This framework incorporate 3D 4D IMRT well 3D volumetric modulate arc ( VMAT ) plan different anatomical site . - ( 2 ) Investigate different parametric form DMH-optimization function . The ultimate goal would simultaneous minimization healthy tissue dose and/or escalation therapeutic dos , without violate establish dosimetric tolerance healthy anatomical structure . - ( 3 ) Practical implementation application novel optimization paradigm , virtual clinical trial cohort lung , head-and-neck , prostate cancer case perform . Statistical significance DMH-optimization dosimetric improvement standard care DVH-optimization quantify . Prospective 3D 4D CT data collection use study interaction tumor time-trending change DMH-based optimization result . 4D CT data also use investigate quantify correlation DMH-based end point loss pulmonary function radiotherapy treatment . The deliverability ( exist radiotherapy treatment equipment ) investigator ' 3D VMAT 3D/4D IMRT plan experimentally verify , thereby pave road initiation clinical trial .</detailed_description>
