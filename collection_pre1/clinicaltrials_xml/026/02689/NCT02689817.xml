	<detailed_description>Hospital-acquired pressure ulcer ( HAPUs ) well-established serious complication hospitalization serious consequence patient morbidity mortality well cost care . Following CMS 's change hospital reimbursement penalization hospital high rate hospital-acquired complication , numerous quality improvement initiative implement . An overall reduction report incidence HAPUs approximately 7 4.5 % observe , largely attributed intervention . Though drop incidence , overall number hospitalize patient develop HAPUs remain large recently HAPU frequency hospital continue decrease , despite educational pressure ulcer prevention program clinical practice guideline . Due complication cost associate development pressure ulcer , research suggest prevention effective standard care . There many current solution preventative intervention HAPUs include leadership initiative , data tracking , risk scale many adjuvant pressure-offloading device bed mattress pad . Many device limit data support effectiveness costly implement purely prophylactic manner current risk stratification method fail capture 60 % patient go develop ulcer . The vast majority current preventative measure pressure ulcer either seek reduce time patient spend one position reduce magnitude pressure occur high-risk area pressure ulcer . As , manual repositioning ( turn ) frequently use intervention felt low-cost part standard care . Repositioning work reduce eliminate interface pressure patient contact surface , standard recommendation 2 hour frequency derive animal study healthy volunteer . An expert consensus Black et al . ( 2011 ) recommend need clinical decision-making base individual 's needs clinical situation establish turn schedule , objective tool clinician use make decision . At core problem patient-centered targeted prevention HAPUs lack knowledge surround magnitude duration pressure necessary cause pressure ulcer , lack immediate feedback whether intervention anything substantially offload risk area . Previous study inconsistent finding association duration surgery HAPU occurrence , result range negative association positive association . This study seek good understand interface pressure patient support surface relate development pressure ulcer . This data provide critical insight physiologic target healthcare provider use develop well pressure ulcer prevention program ultimately lead reduction incidence pressure ulcer . The primary outcome interface pressure trend sacrum throughout duration time patient operate table correlated pressure ulcer development . The effect Braden scale score patient characteristic relationship total length time operate table pressure ulcer development , healthcare provider intervention response pressure read second part study healthcare provider blind pressure data . This study measure interface pressure patient support surface operate room prolong ( &gt; 2 hour ) operative case . Eligible patient receive adhesive pad bandage ( similar Mepilex Gentle Border ) collect interface pressure data . When patient position operating room , bandage apply sacrum . At completion case bandage remove status skin record photo sacrum take documentation . Skin status reassess 24 hour , 1 week , 1 month , 4 month regularly schedule follow-ups surgeon . Pressure ulcer development correlate interface pressure characteristic operative case , use demographic data check homogeneity experimental control group . If interim analysis clear relationship pressure threshold pressure ulcer development , second portion study blind healthcare provider live data . They would able see pressure measurement reposition patient effectively offload . While retrospectively investigate , currently substantial prospective , randomize study . This study significantly add strengthen body evidence regard pressure ulcer development , specifically relationship magnitude interface pressure patient support surface duration time lead development pressure ulcer .</detailed_description>
