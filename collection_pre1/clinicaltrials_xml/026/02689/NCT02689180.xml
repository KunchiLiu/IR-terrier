	<brief_title>Effect Furosemide Withdraw Stable Chronic Heart Failure Outpatients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diuretics play central role HF treatment , particularly episodes acute decompensation . Furosemide prototype loop diuretic , act inhibition Na+K+2Cl- pump thick ascend limb Henle loop . According international registry , almost patient receive loop diuretic hospital stay acute decompensated HF majority discharge take `` maintenance dose '' . Despite undeniable beneficial hemodynamic effect improvement peripheral central congestion , net clinical effect chronic use diuretic HF prognosis controversial . Observational study suggest use high dos diuretic might relate unfavorable clinical consequence . Undesirable side effect loop diuretic trivial involve activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system , elevation norepinephrine level , increase heart rate , detrimental effect renal function several electrolyte disturbance . Few prospective clinical study , however , directly evaluate clinical risk benefit diuretic . Most study under-powered , perform 2 decade ago , modern HF therapy current drug device completely implement . Current clinical guideline unanimous recommend use diuretic HF patient clinical sign symptom congestion , reinforce lack solid clinical scientific evidence use , potential risk might involve . The European Society Cardiology propose administration low dose necessary achieve euvolemia , avoid unnecessary delay use drug modify natural history disease . Based uncertainty diuretic use HF , ReBIC-1 trial design evaluate potential clinical risk benefit withdraw furosemide use stable , apparently euvolemic , chronic HF outpatient multicentric double-blinded randomized clinical trial . ReBIC Brazilian research network create develop clinical study heart failure compose predominantly university tertiary care hospital . ReBIC ReBIC-1 trial sponsor Brazilian National Council Scientific Technological Development ( CNPq , Brazil ) , public governmental institution . Data collection , management , analysis perform network 's data coordinate center Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre . All author review approved manuscript assume full responsibility accuracy completeness data fidelity report study protocol . ReBIC-1 randomized , double-blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled , two-arm trial compare short-term efficacy safety discontinuation furosemide apparently euvolemic outpatient chronic stable HF reduce leave ventricular ejection fraction ( HF-REF ) .</detailed_description>
