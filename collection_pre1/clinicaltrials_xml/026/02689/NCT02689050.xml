	<brief_summary>EUS-FNA recommend diagnostic examination choice patient present suspect low mediastinal lymph node image . EUS-FNA minimal invasive low cost , although good record detecting disease ( eg confirm nodal metastasis granuloma ) limitation exclude disease ( miss metastases/ granuloma ) result false negative rate 15-20 % . Substantial limitation likely attribute area within node sample EUS-FNA tissue acquisition . Improved needle base EBUS/ EUS guide nodal diagnostics might result improved quality fine needle aspiration , reduce surgical diagnostic procedure , reduce cost result short timebefore-treatment interval .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Needle base confocal laser endomicroscopy ( nCLE ) modern image technique , compatible conventional diagnostic aspiration needle , use excitation laser light create 'real-time ' microscopic image tissue . Therefore technique provide additional information regard nodal status could therefore improve diagnostic yield EUS-FNA . Specifically , describe nCLE image characteristic lymph node involve lung cancer sarcoidosis well healthy lymph node . Improved characterization mediastinal node might lead improved diagnosis .</detailed_description>
