	<brief_summary>The purpose study well define intensive care unit population high risk develop Hospital-Acquired Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia ( HABP/VABP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CTTI Risk Factors HABP/VABP Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , observational study adult patient ( ≥18 year old ) admit ICUs . Generally , patient admit ICU indication consider risk develop HABP/VABP . A subset at-risk patient treat select respiratory modality least 12 hour consider high risk development HABP/VABP , baseline data collect , screen daily antibiotic treatment suspect pneumonia . Patients meet high-risk criterion , `` other-ICU patient '' , screen twice weekly antibiotic treatment suspect pneumonia . Once high-risk subject other-ICU patient treat antibiotic either low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) undifferentiated sepsis , additional clinical information record subject 's medical record . All subject treat antibiotic either indication subsequently screen development pneumonia , define FDA draft guidance document drug development HABP/VABP . Subjects meet FDA draft guidance definition pneumonia vitals physiologic data collect follow 4 day pneumonia diagnosed capture result microbiologic test change initial antibiotic therapy .</detailed_description>
