	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study discover modifiable risk factor development neuropathy , specifically look metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Metabolic Syndrome Incidence Neuropathy Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose follow obese individual determine impact aspects metabolic syndrome incidence neuropathy compare lean individual . While many well establish relationship obesity disease , association obesity metabolic syndrome peripheral neuropathy less clear . The investigator follow population 300 adult individual age 18 year old obesity 300 adult individual without obesity aspect metabolic syndrome ( hyperlipidemia , hypertriglyceridemia , hypertension , hyperglycemia , obesity ) . Obese subject recruit Investigational Weight Management Clinic . A proportion subject recruit Blue Care Network Michigan ( BCN ) part Healthy Blue Living campaign support clinical care 400 individual clinic . The individual recruit directly clinic identify via flyer , word mouth , umclinicalstudies.org . The phenotyping information obese subject already complete part initial project . Lean subject undergo screen eligibility , include take height , weight , blood pressure , lipid profile , glucose tolerance test . Neuropathy measure complete baseline 2 year ( obese subject ) include : definite clinical neuropathy establish use Toronto consensus guideline base upon neurologic exam , nerve conduction study , Michigan Neuropathy-Specific Instrument , Utah Early Neuropathy Scale , balance hip strength measure , cognitive testing ( computerized cognitive screen determine obesity affect central nervous system ) ( also do time 12 +/- 4 week 52 +/- 4 week post-baseline visit ) , neurothesiometer test , skin biopsy determine nerve fiber density , Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test ( QSART ) measure autonomic nerve control sweating , heart rate variability/cardiac autonomic neuropathy test assess autonomic neuropathy , quantitative sensory test assess small fiber neuropathy , Sudoscan ass sweat gland function , follow questionnaire : Neuropathy Quality Life , McGill Pain , Autonomic symptom profile . The investigator intend demonstrate obesity aspects metabolic syndrome direct impact incidence peripheral neuropathy .</detailed_description>
