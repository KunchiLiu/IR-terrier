	<brief_title>Bendamustine Rituximab Combination Therapy Cold Agglutinin Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Chronic cold agglutinin disease ( CAD ) mediate monoclonal cold-reactive autoantibody bind erythrocyte surface antigen , cause hemagglutination complement-mediated hemolysis . Anemia severe one-third patient ( hemoglobin level 8.0 g/dL low ) . Cold-induced circulatory symptom present 90 % patient may disable . CAD associate overt lymphoma disease traditionally classify primary idiopathic . A monoclonal lymphoproliferative bone marrow disorder , however , demonstrate flow cytometry 90 % histology approximately 75 % patient , characterize clonal proliferation CD20+ , kappa+ B-cells . Approximately two-thirds patient experience exacerbation febrile illness . During steady-state CAD , majority patient low level complement proteins C3 C4 continuous consumption . These low level , particular low C4 availability , seem rate-limiting hemolysis prevent full-blown activation complement cascade C5 cleavage intravascular hemolysis . During acute phase reaction , C3 C4 level increase due enhanced production , result exacerbation hemolysis . Counseling cold avoidance recommend treatment choice patient primary CAD . A systematic review show , however , 70 % case , physician and/or patient perceive measure sufficient ) . Many standard therapy use autoimmune disease indolent lymphomas inefficient , e.g . corticosteroid , alkylating agent , interferon-α , probably , purine analogue single agent therapy . Treatment chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab show prospective study induce remission half patient . Almost responses partial , median response duration less one year . In subsequent , prospective non-randomized trial fludarabine rituximab combination therapy 29 patient , 22 patient ( 76 % ) respond , 6 ( 21 % ) achieve CR 16 ( 55 % ) achieve PR . Among 10 patient non-responsive rituximab monotherapy , CR observe combination therapy one patient PR six . Median increase Hb level 3.1 g/dL responder 4.0 g/dL among achieved CR . Median time response 4.0 month . Lower quartile response duration reach 33 month , estimate median response duration 66 month . Targeting pathogenic B-cell clone efficiently seem important achievement remission . Though rituximab-based therapy first major achievement therapy CAD , problem remain solved . First , considerable number patient respond rituximab monotherapy . Second , although use fludarabine rituximab combination result high response rate prolong response duration , toxicity significant still non-responders . Third , therapeutic approach probably individualize ; e.g. , fludarabine therapy may bring problem young patient late-occurring adverse event old one short-term hematologic toxicity . The antineoplastic drug , bendamustine hydrochloride , combine 2-chlorethylamine group nitrogen mustard derive alkylating agent benzimidazole ring structure purine analogue . Bendamustine show highly active variety lymphoproliferative disorder . The combination bendamustine rituximab produce high overall complete response rate prolong remission moderate manageable toxicity Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia , closely related primary CAD . In attempt improve therapeutic efficacy achieve rituximab-based regimen toxicity profile fludarabine-rituximab combination , investigator want study safety efficacy bendamustine rituximab combination therapy patient primary CAD . Clinical study The study prospective , non-randomized multicenter trial design investigate efficacy safety bendamustine rituximab combination therapy patient CAD require treatment . Because low prevalence CAD , unrealistic undertake statistically robust randomize study . The investigator aim include 50 patient study period three year . 2.1 Study objective The objective ass safety efficacy combination therapy bendamustine rituximab patient CAD . Primary endpoint : Rate complete partial response , respectively . Secondary endpoint : Time response ; time best response ; hematological toxicity grade 4 ; frequency dose reduction ; response duration . 2.2 . Ethics The trial carry accordance Helsinki Declaration current statutory requirement legislation participate country . The study approve relevant Medical Research Ethics Committees , Norwegian Medicines Agency relevant regulatory authority participate country . Data record anonymously , numeric code assign order able track data . All investigator well ethic committee relevant health authority , however , access source data . The principal investigator country establish monitoring study independent monitor require . 2.3 Study design Prospective , non-randomized international multicenter study . 2.4 Study population In principle , individual age least 18 year include , although enrollment patient young 40 year unlikely due age-specific prevalence disease . 3 The drug 3.1 Rituximab Rituximab humanize , chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody . Treatment rituximab consider establish , experimental therapy CAD , involve physician nurse familiar administration , therapeutic adverse effect safety issue . In particular , able identify manage infusion-related side effect . 3.2 Bendamustine Bendamustine experimental drug trial , market Mundipharma/Norpharma . The drug approve participate country treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia multiple myeloma . It cytotoxic agent combine 2-chlorethylamine group nitrogen mustard derive alkylating agent benzimidazole ring structure purine nucleoside analogue . Precautions warning include possibility myelosuppression , infection , skin reaction , caution patient cardiac disorder , nausea , vomit , tumor lysis syndrome ( unlikely primary CAD ) , anaphylaxis extravasation . 4 Inclusion patient . Examination inclusion 4.1 History . Clinical radiological examination Year first occurrence clinical symptom register along data hemolytic anemia , circulatory symptom , cold- fever-induced exacerbation , previous therapy , lymph node enlargement spleen enlargement ( clinical assessment ) . Chest radiograph abdominal ultrasonography do already perform last four month . 4.2 Blood test Hemolysis detect quantify base Hb , MCV , reticulocyte count ( x 109/L ) , LDH , bilirubin haptoglobin . These measurement do twice last two month treatment . Hematological , biochemical immunological assessment do inclusion + 2 week : - WBC , leukocyte differential count , platelet count - Iron , transferrin ( TIBC ) , ferritin , cobalamine folate - CRP - Quantification IgM , IgG IgA Serum electrophoresis detection identification monoclonal immunoglobulin ( include immunofixation appropriate ) - Cold agglutinin titer - Specific direct antiglobulin test ( DAT , direct Coombs ' test ) , i.e . use polyspecific antiserum , anti-C3d anti-IgG ) - Complement assessment ( C3 C4 ) - CMV VZV antibodies - Serological test hepatitis B C - Freezing 5 ml EDTA-blood possible later DNA-based study 5 Therapy Treatment schedule Day 1 : Rituximab ; 375 mg/m2 Day 1-2 : Bendamustine ; dosage : see Section 5.2 Day 29 : Rituximab ; 375 mg/m2 Day 29-30 : Bendamustine ; dosage : see Section 5.2 5.4 Day 57 : Rituximab ; 375 mg/m2 Day 57-58 : Bendamustine ; dosage : see Section 5.2 5.4 Day 85 : Rituximab ; 375 mg/m2 Day 85-86 : Bendamustine ; dosage : see Section 5.2 5.4 5.2 Initial bendamustine dose Patients previous cytotoxic therapy history myelosuppression receive bendamustin initial dose 90 mg/m2 day 1 2 ( dose level A ) . In patient previously treat fludarabine-containing regimen , initial bendamustine dose 70 mg/m2 day 1 2 ( dose level B ) . In patient previously receive myelosuppressive agent purine analogue , choice initial dose level A B base individualized assessment . Bendamustine solution infusion prepare accord manufacturer 's recommendation . The solution administer intravenous infusion 60 minute . Antiemetic prophylaxis give accord local routine base individualized assessment . Rituximab administer accord manufacturer 's recommendation routines participate hospital . Rapid ( 90 minute ) infusion allow cycle 2-4 provide infusion-related adverse event precede rituximab infusion . For drug stability reason , in-line blood warmer use infusion bendamustine rituximab . The infusion solution room temperature ; patient , particular extremity choose infusion , keep warm procedure . Dose adjustment In case significant toxicity , dose bendamustine reduce specify protocol . Any adverse event record appropriate CRF . For report SAEs SUSARs , see Protocol 6 Follow-up 6.1 Follow-up first 6 month therapy A ) The following measurement must do monthly first six month last cycle combination therapy : I ) All measurement list Paragraph 6.1.B . II ) In case reduction previously elevate IgM level normal range , serum electrophoresis immunofixation perform next visit . III ) Number blood transfusion previous monthly visit .
