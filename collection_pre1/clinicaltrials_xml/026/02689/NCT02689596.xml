	<brief_title>Oxytocin Resting State fMRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although several fMRI study investigate neural correlate OT administration , focus underlying modulatory effect OT baseline brain function . While functional MRI examine neural activity certain task , might especially interesting ass main effect OT basic activity human brain rest . This rest state activity become typically evident default mode network ( DMN ) , compromise midline structure medial frontal cortex , cingulate precuneus , well specific rest state network . In fact , recent study succeed demonstrate modulatory influence OT . Recent study able show increase functional connectivity rest amygdala medial prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) small sample 15 subject . However , distinct subregions amygdala seem involve different OT effect . To goal present study decipher modulatory effect OT subregions amygdala large sample use improved anatomical mapping seed region relate alteration individual trait healthy volunteer . We expect add evidence increase amygdala - PFC connectivity OT well detail anatomical mapping network .</detailed_description>
