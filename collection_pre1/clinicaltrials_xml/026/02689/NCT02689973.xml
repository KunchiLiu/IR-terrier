	<brief_summary>This longitudinal experimental study test effect three brief intervention : ( 1 ) prompt formation plan ( implementation intention ) , ( 2 ) prompt self-efficacy belief , ( 3 ) prompt plan + self-efficacy adolescent age 14-18 year relative active 'education ' control group . It hypothesize participant assigned intervention would exhibit small increase body fat 14-month follow-up compare control . The study also investigate whether combine plan + self-efficacy intervention would large effect main outcome ( body fat ) single-component intervention . Second , hypothesize effect intervention condition body fat 14-month follow-up would mediate respective psychological behavioral construct : self-efficacy planning T2 ( Mediator 1 ) , moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) T3 ( Mediator 2 ) . It expect effect intervention include plan component ( i.e. , plan intervention self-efficacy + planning intervention ) would mediate respective cognition , i.e . planning , whereas effect intervention include self-efficacy component ( i.e. , self-efficacy intervention self-efficacy + planning intervention ) would mediate self-efficacy . Finally , explore whether effect intervention ( direct indirect effect , via respective psychological variable MVPA ) body fat would moderate presence build PA facility , locate proximity school .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The experimental procedure integrate health promotion education program . Pre-manipulation education : Across study group , participant receive common healthy lifestyle education program , focus nutrition physical activity , part school curriculum . The combination nutrition PA intervention line best practice guideline intervention promote healthy body weight . The education program deliver teacher group format use . The group discuss food composition , safe food handling , food labeling , nutrient need age gender group , dietary guideline , clinical nutrition issue . The program include behavior change technique accompany change policy . The intervention condition deliver via combination print form paper-and-pencil exercise face-to-face session . All experimental condition include initial session ( complete form individually group + face-to-face component ) set handouts three follow week . The face-to-face component deliver within three day complete initial form . The initial session follow booster session ( group + face-to-face component ) , deliver 2-month follow-up . Across group , complete form ( individual component ) take approximately 30 minute conduct classroom . The face-to-face component take 45-60 minute conduct office school nurse school psychologist . Group intervention component . At baseline participant complete intervention material individually , use self-copy paper ; copy collect fidelity analysis original leave participant . The paper-and-pencil material follow similar format four group term word count , visual format , number length section require participant fill blank . Face-to-face intervention component . During face-to-face component ( baseline booster session ) participant receive feedback body weight , information regard physical activity level energy expenditure base participant 's age , gender , body weight , follow moderate-to-vigorous physical activity recommendation ( body mass body fat measure booster session record ) . Next , participant experimenter jointly review form complete group component . Adolescents report included plan prompt provide even detailed response question include form . Experimenters ask participant read content form loudly ; look section incomplete encouraged adolescent complete section ; prompt participant provide detailed response .</detailed_description>
