	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin Relapsed/Refractory Germ Cell Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To determine anti-tumor efficacy brentuximab vedotin relapsed/ refractory NSGCT . Secondary Objectives 1 . To determine progression free survival patient relapsed/ refractory NSGCT treat brentuximab vedotin . 2 . To determine overall survival patient relapsed/ refractory NSGCT treat brentuximab vedotin . 3 . To determine safety tolerability brentuximab vedotin patient population . Eligible patient divide two cohort , CD30 positive CD30 negative/unknown . Both group treat similarly parallel analyze separately . CD30 status may unknown unlikely case tumor-marker-only relapse fresh tumor biopsy feasible , archival tumor tissue obtainable despite effort . These patient include CD30 negative cohort analysis purpose , since statistically NSGCT likely CD30 negative . The number patient unknown CD30 status exceed 5 patient . Eligible patient treat brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg IV every 3 week ( maximum dose 180 mg ) indefinitely disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , study closure.Eligible patient grade 2 peripheral neuropathy enrollment treat brentuximab vedotin 1.2 mg/kg IV every 3 week ( maximum dose 180 mg ) indefinitely disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , study closure . Response treatment assess clinically history , physical exam tumor marker measurement ( BHCG AFP ) day 1 cycle CT scan cycle 2 , 4 , every 4 cycle thereafter receive treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subject must meet follow applicable inclusion criterion participate study : 1 . Age ≥ 18 year time inform consent . 2 . Patients histologically serologically confirm relapsed/refractory nonseminoma germ cell tumor , ( i.e. , embryonal carcinoma , choriocarcinoma , yolk sac tumor ) include female GCT primary mediastinal NSGCT . 3 . Patients must progress prior high dose chemotherapy ( HDCT ) treatment , deem candidate high dose chemotherapy refuse highdose chemotherapy , consider incurable standard therapy include chemotherapy surgery . There maximum allowable number previous therapy . `` Failure '' prior therapy define : 1 . A &gt; 25 % increase product perpendicular diameter measurable tumor mass prior therapy amenable surgical resection . 2 . The presence new tumor amenable surgical resection . 3 . An increase AFP betahCG ( two separate determination least one week apart require rise tumor marker evidence failure ) . NOTE : Patients clinically grow `` teratoma '' ( normal decline tumor marker radiographic clinical progression ) consider surgery . 4 . Patients must evidence recurrent metastatic carcinoma one following : ) The appearance metastatic disease standard image technique ii ) The appearance rise serum tumor marker , AFP betahCG NOTE : If rise tumor marker evidence progressive disease , least 2 consecutive rise value least one week apart need . Patients evidence disease rise tumor marker AFP betahCG provide alternate cause increase serum level marker present , cross reaction luteinizing Hormone ( LH ) ( test need testosterone suppression LH ) , hepatitis , use marijuana second primary tumor , etc . 5 . Patients primary medistinal non seminomatous germ cell tumor eligible receive first line platinum base chemotherapy recurrence amenable surgical resection base treat physician expert opinion . 6 . Patients late relapse ( &gt; 2 year ) non seminomatous germ cell tumor eligible receive first line platinum base chemotherapy recurrence amenable surgical resection base treat physician expert opinion . 7 . Patients brain metastasis allow onto study long patient complete treatment brain metastasis , long require corticosteroid , asymptomatic . Subjects neurological symptom undergo head CT scan brain MRI exclude brain metastasis , discretion treat physician . 8 . Patients ECOG performance status 02 . 9 . Adequate organ marrow function define : 1 . Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL 2 . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm3 3 . Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 4 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN except patient document Gilbert 's syndrome ( ≤ 3 × ULN ) 5 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN ; patient hepatic metastasis , ALT AST ≤ 5 × ULN 6 . Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min determine CockcroftGault equation . 10 . Patients willing able comply protocol study procedure include willingness undergo tumor biopsy tumor cell therapy ass CD30 status ( unless archival tumor tissue orchiectomy previous sample obtainable despite effort fresh tumor biopsy feasible ) . 11 . Females childbearing potential must pregnant breastfeeding . Male female patient reproductive potential must agree use two form highly effective contraception screen visit 28 day last dose study drug . Acceptable form effective contraception include : Oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) . Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . Male sterilization ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) . True abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle subject . [ Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . ] Pregnancy test females childbearing potential require ; must serum screen post treatment safety assessment visit . A positive urine pregnancy test must confirm serum pregnancy test pelvic US since NSGCT may secrete betahCG cause false positive pregnancy . A pelvic US need repeat cycle unless treat physician think necessary . 12 . Potential subject must ability understand ( judge treat physician ) willingness provide write informed consent HIPAA authorization release personal health information . NOTE : HIPAA authorization may include informed consent obtain separately . Written informed consent must obtain potential subject prior conduct studyspecific procedure . Exclusion Criteria Subjects meeting criterion may participate study : 1 . Patients pure seminoma . 2 . Patients pure teratoma . 3 . Chemotherapy within 2 week initiate study treatment . There maximum allowable number previous therapy . 4 . Major surgery within 3 week start study treatment . There minimum time requirement minor procedure biopsy vascular access placement . 5 . Radiation within 2 week start study treatment . 6 . ≥ Grade 3 neuropathy time enrollment . 7 . Pregnancy breastfeed . 8 . Previous treatment antiCD30 direct therapy .</criteria>
