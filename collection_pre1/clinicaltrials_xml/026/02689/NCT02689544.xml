	<brief_title>Effects Static Stretching Dynamic Flexibility Performance : Blind Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It randomize , blind clinical trial first researcher ( P1 ) responsible assessment reassessment ; second searcher ( P2 ) randomization inquiry subject intervention protocol third investigator ( P3 ) statistical analyzes.The research conduct Laboratory therapeutic practice Department Physical Therapy , Federal University Rio Grande Norte ( UFRN ) start approval ethic committee.The sample recruit convenience write disclosure , electronics personal contact academies high education institution city Natal / RN . The volunteer randomly distribute electronic site http : //www.randomization.com ( Code : 21318 ) . Two piece information insert , namely : sample size number group . With data , site generate specific encode group distribute subject randomly three group : static stretching ( gAE ) ; dynamic stretching ( gAD ) control ( gC ) . Sample size calculation For sample size calculation use G * Power 3.1.0 software procedure follow recommendation study prévios45 . Based pilot study four volunteer , adopt power 0.95 , consider significance level 5 % , correlation coefficient 0.5 , 0.25 effect size , It calculate `` n '' sample 15 individual group ( `` n '' sample = 45 ) . This analysis perform reduce chance Type II error determine minimum number individual require investigation . Thus , sample size sufficient provide 95.5 % statistical power . Procedures evaluation measure At first subject record survey evaluation form contain information identification , weight , height , injury history physical activity . After process randomization allocation hold P2 , volunteer undergo first evaluation ( AV1 ) instruction P1 . This evaluation perform least 48 hour 1st stretch session prevent possible residual effect isokinetic functional testing . Other evaluation AV2 , AV3 AV4 , make immediately 1st ( acute response ) 10th session ( acute post elongation ) 48 hour last ( residual chronic response ) , respectively , EAG GAD . Already subject gc subject four evaluation process , last assessment ( AV4 ) coincide time related stretch protocol experimental group . Despite receive guideline group importance stretch activity routine study period volunteer tell perform stretch day-to-day . All non-dominant leg ( MND ) test flexibility , neuromuscular performance ( muscle latency time isokinetic performance ) functional performance ( functional test ) four assessment . The MND use consider less skilled trainable , compare MD46 . For identification ask member prefer kick bola15 . However , intervention experimental group ( GAE , GAD ) , member elongate , evaluate pain sensation end session end intervention protocol , sensory perception ( pleasure / displeasure ) perform elongation . The day period prevail assessment reassessment afternoon shift .</detailed_description>
