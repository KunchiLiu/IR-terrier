	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives The primary objective study evaluate efficacy chemotherapy-free combination ibrutinib obinutuzumab ( GA 101 ) patient previously untreated follicular lymphoma ( FL ) high tumor burden . Primary endpoint observe rate progression free survival one year start therapy . Hypothesis The hypothesis study ibrutinib combination obinutuzumab achieve response rate ( CR PR ) , rate MRD negativity PFS comparable currently use standard rituximab-chemotherapy combination R-CHOP R-bendamustine subject previously untreated FL high tumor burden .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN This prospective , multicenter phase 2 study 98 subject previously untreated FL high tumor burden advance stage need therapy . The study include central monitoring MRD PCR , central pathologic review complimentary research project include monitor immune response . The study therapy comprise initial 6 cycle ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab follow additional 24 month ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab maintenance . In patient MRD negative 30 month , i.e . end ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab maintenance , without clinical progression treatment give MRD monitor continue . MRD monitor regularly perform peripheral blood sample collect start therapy month 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 30 respectively . Subsequently , MRD analyse perform every 6 month clinical progression disease maximum 4 year ( end study ) . If MRD assessment peripheral blood sample turn positive negative within first 30 month , confirmatory blood bone marrow sample take 6 month thereafter . In patient remain MRD positive 30 month without clinical progression , single agent ibrutinib therapy continue another 12 month . An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) form constitute . The independent DMC review safety treatment make recommendation conduct study . The data generate phase II study serve basis subsequent randomize phase III study compare chemotherapy-free combination ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab standard immune-chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
