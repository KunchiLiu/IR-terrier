	<brief_summary>Patients chronic adrenal insufficiency need adapt glucocorticoid replacement dose condition physical psychological stress prevent life threaten adrenal crisis . In case severe impairment unsecure gastrointestinal absorption ( e.g . gastroenteritis , severe infectious disease ) , rapid highly dosed administration glucocorticoid crucial . The study conduct offer female patient possibility perform efficient prednisone self-administration emergency situation way administration , easy perform accept patient . Therefore , pharmacokinetics safety vaginal prednisone administration study compare rectal administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaginal Prednisone Administration Prevention Adrenal Crisis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As patient adrenal insufficiency still die adrenal crisis , improvement prevention also emergency management need . It clear perfect equipment education patient key crisis prevention management . Vaginal administration prednisone-suppositories easy perform independent gastro-intestinal system . Thus , study aim efficacy , feasibility safety vaginal administration prednisone-suppositories . Recruitment : Patients primary adrenal insufficiency recruit . The adrenal insufficiency registry Würzburg comprise 150 patient primary adrenal insufficiency . Several patient already indicate interest participate study . According European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) note guidance investigation bioavailability bioequivalence number 12 participant regard minimum require number . Trial flow : Pharmacokinetic study perform two different study visit . Patients receive 100mg prednisone suppository ( Rectodelt® 100 mg ) vaginal rectal two different study visit ( interval longer one week ) . Blood sample determination prednisone adrenocorticotropic Hormone ( ACTH ) level collect time period 6 hour . Patients receive diary document eventual local systemic adverse event follow 7 day . Stopping rule : Participation patient fully voluntarily . Patients able stop participation study point time . In addition , patient might claim elimination data material point time . Furthermore , study participation stop individual patient , new safety issue occur ( e. g. new diagnosis Diabetes mellitus , pregnancy acute infectious disease ) study . Relevant risk patient highly unlikely . However , 2 patient experience serious adverse event associate vaginal administration prednisone high likelihood , study stop . Written informed consent : A consent document include patient information upon nature , scope possible consequence trial must approve Institutional Review Board . Patients amenable inclusion trial give sufficient time study write information , well possibility ask question sign consent document . Analysis : Documentation analysis perform Department Medicine I , Endocrine Diabetes Unit , University Würzburg , Germany . Data document pseudonymisation data base . Data analysis mainly descriptive ( bioequivalence vaginal prednisone administration compare rectal application , estimation patient regard convenience tolerability different mode drug administration , safety aspect ) . Safety : In course trial , change physical finding well clinical sign symptom may reflect adverse effect document . Furthermore , adverse event document appropriate report form . When adverse event occur grade accord National cancer Institute - common toxicity criterion ( NCI-CTC ) ( version 4.0 ) . Patients receive diary document local systemic adverse event follow 7 day intervention . In addition , patient contact phone 3 ( ±1 ) 7 ( ±1 ) day vaginal administration prednisone . If patient report adverse event possibly relate vaginal administration route , called-in physical examination detail documentation . To enhance individual patient 's safety study , safety assessment perform prior subsequent intervention . In addition , safety assessment perform 4 8 subsequent vaginal administration prednisone evaluation event 7 day follow period administration .</detailed_description>
