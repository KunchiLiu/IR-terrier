	<brief_summary>This study propose treat patient combination erlotinib temozolomide . Patients relapse , recurrent , refractory , high risk malignancy whose tumor possess non-synonymous mutation EGFR , ERBB2 , JAK2V617F ( JAK2 ) eligible study . Very phase 2 clinical trial perform pediatrics use targeted agent combination conventional chemotherapy agent . Furthermore , since combination combination study ( erlotinib temozolomide ) show additive/synergistic effect preclinical study , therapy select patient possess mutation target TKI study , may unveil activity previously observe . Thus , investigator hope determine whether addition additive/synergistic chemotherapy increase efficacy target agent and/or increase tumor susceptibility target agent result increased anti-tumor activity .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>One 21 year age Relapsed , recurrent , refractory malignancy . All solid tumor diagnosis eligible . Pathologic confirmation diagnosis either original diagnosis recurrence . Known nonsynonymous mutation follow gene : EGFR , ERBB2 , JAK2V617F ( JAK2 ) . Genomic sample preferably relapse , may stage treatment relapse sample reasonably obtainable . Genetic analysis determination eligibility occur part routine care perform specifically purpose study . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 10 mm CT MRI scan , ≥ 20 mm chest xray , ≥ 10 mm caliper clinical exam . Prior therapy follow : Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Patients must receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 2 week enrollment onto study ( 6 week prior nitrosourea ) . Hematopoietic growth factor : At least 14 day must elapse receive pegfilgrastim least 7 day must elapse since completion therapy nonpegylated growth factor . Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : At least 7 day must elapse since completion therapy biologic agent . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period prior enrollment must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . Monoclonal antibody : At least 3 halflives must elapse since prior therapy include monoclonal antibody . ( See post halflives commonly use monoclonal antibody DVL homepage ; http : //members.childrensoncologygroup.org/Disc/devtherapeutics/default.asp . ) Radiotherapy : At least 2 week must elapse since local palliative XRT ( small port ) ; least 6 week must elapse since treatment therapeutic dos MIBG ; least 3 month must elapse prior craniospinal XRT receive , 50 % pelvis irradiate , TBI receive ; least 6 week must elapse substantial bone marrow irradiation give . Stem cell transplant rescue without TBI : No evidence active graft vs. host disease least 2 month must elapse since transplant . Patients must performance status correspond Karnofsky Lansky great equal 50 % . Use Karnofsky patient &gt; 16 year age Lansky patient ≤ 16 year age . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Normal bone marrow organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine ≤ IULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal INR ≤ IULN PT ≤ IULN Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . A history malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Currently receive investigational agent . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition erlotinib , temozolomide , dacarbazine . Currently follow concomitant medication substances potential affect activity pharmacokinetics study drug ( ) . The use follow medication discontinue prior initiation protocol therapy avoid protocol therapy reasonable alternative exist . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , renal failure , cardiac arrhythmia , interstitial lung disease , hepatic failure / hepatorenal syndrome , GI perforation , cerebrovascular event , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , corneal perforation/ulceration , document Hepatitis B virus infection . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day study entry . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction erlotinib temozolomide . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
