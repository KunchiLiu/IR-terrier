	<brief_summary>Primary objective # 1 : Determine relative effectiveness MI-IOP MI-PC full study sample regard treatment engagement week 1-12 alcohol use week 1-24 . Hypothesis 1 : An intervention explore several possible treatment option patient provide choose option ( e.g. , MI-PC ) produce high rate treatment engagement intervention focus engagement IOP ( e.g. , MI-IOP ) . Hypothesis 2 : An intervention explore several possible treatment option patient provide choose option ( e.g. , MI-PC ) produce good alcohol use outcomes intervention focus engagement IOP ( MI-IOP ) . Secondary analysis 1 : Among Non-engaged patient , determine rate selection three option MI-PC , retention rate within option , alcohol use outcomes option . Secondary analysis 2 : Among Engaged patient , determine rate selection three option MI-PC , retention rate within option , alcohol use outcomes option . Primary objective # 2 : Determine whether relative effectiveness MI-IOP MI-PC varies function engagement group , regard treatment engagement week 1-12 alcohol use outcomes week 1-24 . Hypothesis 1 : The predicted main effect retention favor MI-PC MI-IOP significantly large among patient Non-engaged group among Engaged group . Hypothesis 2 : The predicted main effect cocaine use outcomes favor MI-PC MI-IOP significantly large among patient Non-engaged group among Engaged group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3 . Secondary objective # 1 : Examine outcome three secondary measure : percent day abstinent substance , negaÂ¬tive consequence alcohol use , HIV high risk behavior . Hypothesis 1 : Outcomes secondary measure well MI-PC MI-IOP . 4 . Secondary objective # 2 : Test hypotheses concern potential mediator predict main effect favor MI-PC MI-IOP . Hypothesis 1 : The predicted advantage MI-PC MI-IOP mediate great increase motivation , self-efficacy , commitment abstinence , self-help involvement MI-PC . 5 . Secondary objective # 3 : Test hypotheses concern effect additional MI intervention initial non-engagement persists 12 week . Hypothesis 1 : A second telephone MI intervention produce high rate subsequent engagement less alcohol use MI .</detailed_description>
