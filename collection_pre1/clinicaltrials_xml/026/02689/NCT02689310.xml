	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize use leptospermum scoparium honey type dress and/or debridement agent stage III IV pressure ulcer increase efficacy safety compare current treatment protocol include use hydrogel/Vaseline , collagenase , silver alginate dressing standard care . Utilizing non-inferiority trial , expect use leptospermum scoparium treatment Stage III Stage IV pressure ulcer inferior comparison treatment standard care wound dressing . Moreover , research design enable research team determine honey base dressing equivalent superior comparison treatment . Therefore , investigator specific study objective follow : 1 . Primary Objectives : Determine use honey alternative treatment reduce site inflammation/irritation pain associated pressure ulcer compare standard treatment option . Specifically , investigator monitor patient PUSH score , Braden Risk Scale score , granulation and/or epithelial tissue progression , length time heal , patient pain assessment via Wong Baker Face Numeric Scale , wound odor , incidence adverse event ( measure allergy , sting sensation , bacterial infection warrant antibiotic intervention , etc. ) . 2 . Secondary Objective : Patients honey treatment group lower cost per heal ulcer patient standard collagenase treatment group .</brief_summary>
