	<brief_title>Prostate Embolization Acute Urinary Retention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label prospective , multicenter ( centralized procedure ) , single arm , sequentially enrol study . Twenty subject enrol study . Patient refer attend urologists failure currently recommend approach Trial WithOut Catheter ( TWOC ) alpha-adrenergic receptor ( AR ) blocker . It expect AUR case refer local urological clinic consider inclusion trial . A trial log book complete refer local urologist order obtain preliminary data applicability trial AUR comer institution . This log book limit simple questionnaire ensure high rate completion attend resident/fellow ( Patients age , size prostate , previous Benign Prostate Hypertrophy symptom , renal function ) . It use order assess external validity first phase trial help design potential next step trial . When patient present AUR correspond urological clinic , PI Clinical research coordinator inform short text message , fax e-mail order prepare follow process . Patient inform urologist ongoing research project . In summary , consist inform patient first step TWOC case failure TWOC several option offer include PAE trial setting . Inclusion patient consider case failure TWOC . If patient willing participate , patient see clinic Principal Investigator co-investigator order inform protocol obtain sign informed consent . PAE schedule upon first contact make sure PAE perform short delay follow failure TWOC . The goal perform PAE week follow recatheterization . For practical reason delay might extend recorded Case Report Form .</detailed_description>
