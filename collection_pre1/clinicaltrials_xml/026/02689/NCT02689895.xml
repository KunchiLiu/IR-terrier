	<brief_summary>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) transform fatal condition chronic , manageable condition . However , estimate 20-40 % patient 2nd line treatment ( 2 nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NRTIs ] boost protease inhibitor [ PI ] ) fail treatment . Figures think high child adolescent . The reason patient fail 2nd line treatment exactly know . Failure previously attribute poor adherence . However , literature show patient boost PIs achieve maintain viral suppression despite suboptimal adherence ( adherence 80- 95 % ) . Viral factor , like drug resistance , also implicate treatment failure . However , boost PIs high genetic barrier clinically significant mutation . Therefore , virus would harbour multiple PI mutation virus reduce susceptibility boost PI regimen . Pharmacological factor suboptimal dosing , impaired absorption drug interaction may also responsible treatment failure . If sub-optimal adherence reason child fail 2nd line treatment , restore optimal adherence result viral suppression , failure might mean cause contribute failure . If resistance cause treatment failure , study provide evidence advocate resistance test use 3rd line antiretroviral drug . If child adequate adherence demonstrate inadequate drug level plasma , study provide evidence advocate study examine reason inadequate drug exposure amongst HIV-infected child . These study paramount optimize dose algorithms population . This propose study help elucidate reason treatment failure HIV-infected child second line treatment aim ultimately optimize antiretroviral treatment strategy important group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , control , interventional study , conduct 2 phase . Phase 1 The first phase study include : 1 . Screening study eligibility ( viral load administer eligibility screen form 2 . Randomisation study arm ( 1:1 ) - random computer generate number , seal opaque envelope , clinic nurse keep envelope produce sequentially ask 3 . Enrolment- informed consent assent , 2 questionnaire administer , hair sample collect 4 . Three month follow-up 5 . Post- intervention/control questionnaire administer , viral load hair sample collect 6 . Patients viral load &lt; 1 000 copies/ml arm exit study . Those viral load &gt; = 1 000 copies/ml arm proceed phase 2 Phase 2 Patients viral load &gt; = 1 000 copies/ml arm genotyping drug resistance Hair pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study Some participant may re-suppress adherence counselling . Hair anti-retroviral ( ARV ) level show whether patient take ARVs past 3 month . Suboptimal ARV level hair may mean adherence suboptimal dose patient take suboptimal . Presence adequate drug level patient still virologically fail treatment may imply resistance . Hair collection do accord Women 's Interagency HIV Study hair collection protocol describe . All hair sample store cool , dry place department Clinical Pharmacology University Zimbabwe . Analysis do validate method University Carlifornia San Francisco ( UCSF ) . Hair collection procedure : 1 . Clean blade pair scissors alcohol pad allow blade completely dry prior use 2 . Lift top layer hair occipital region scalp . Isolate small thatch hair ( ~20 fibre hair ) underneath top layer hair occipital region ( use hair clip keep top layer hair away ) 3 . Cut small hair sample patient 's head close scalp possible 4 . Unfold piece aluminium foil place cut thatch hair inside piece foil 5 . Place small label patient 's study identity ( ID ) distal end hair thatch ( side furthest away scalp ) 6 . Refold foil completely enclose thatch hair 7 . Place study ID label fold piece foil 8 . Place fold piece foil inside plastic ( e.g . Ziplock® ) bag ( Ziplock bag desiccant bag seal bag . Given black child adolescent naturally short hair curl kinky , hair collect regardless length . However , shave bold , participant enrol , study initiation defer particular participant 1 month allow hair grow length analyse . Directly administer anti-retroviral therapy Modified DAART administer randomly select participant 3 month ( 90 consecutive calendar day include weekend public holiday ) . These 90 day divide 3 month ( month 1 , 2 3 ) , month 30 day . Participants visit home research assistant directly watch swallow ARVs complete home visit chart , participant completes pill chart . Home visit schedule day Monday Friday , time participant take ATV/r . Research assistant require fill form see participant swallow ARVs time see swallow . Home visit schedule : 1 . Daily first 10 days- Monday Friday 2 . Then twice week 2 week 3 . Then week 2 week 4 . Then fortnightly remainder 3 month On Saturdays , Sundays public holiday , participant contact cell phone ( SMS text ) day remind take medication . Contacting participant cell phone do research assistant record chart . With exception ATV/r , antiretroviral therapy drug self administer , participant ask take VLW present mDAART , retrospectively weekend public holiday . A separate form fill drug . Appropriate time take ARVs study within 2 hour time participant suppose take his/her medication . Therefore , dose record take correctly report take either within 2 hour within 2 hour time suppose take day 's particular dose . If 2 hour &lt; 12 hour lapse time participant suppose take dose , particular dose record delay . If participant take his/her medication 12 hour , particular dose report miss . If participant find home , direct phone call make participant caregiver . On home visit chart , research assistant record participant absent . However , research assistant inquire participant take medication record appropriately . At end 90 day allocate participant , adherence assess measure hair atazanavir concentration self report adherence questionnaire . Research assistants The research assistant recruit community base organisation call Child Protection Society ( CPS ) . These research assistant know voluntary lay worker ( VLWs ) , train research ethic . They also involve research several time . The VLWs train protocol PI . A VLW assignment form fill allocate VLW participant . The VLW reside community participant . Posts advertise openly within CPS relevant community-based organisation . Eligibility criterion include : 1 . Prior research experience 2 . Valid training research 3 . Resident within Harare hospital catchment area 4 . Demonstration ability read write 5 . Ability travel foot public transport household 6 . Ability care nurture adolescents 7 . Ability keep information confidential . Eligible research assistant train visit home begin , refresher course do 2 month begin home visit , 3 month . CD4 count viral load test CD4 count , viral load PK profile do baseline repeat 3 month DAART standard care . Patients virologically unsuppressed DAART expect re-suppress . Failure achieve virological suppression DAART may mean factor contribute treatment failure , instance resistance suboptimal dosing . CD4 count viral load sample process private laboratory cost patient . However , patient CD4 count viral load measure previous 2 month repeat CD4 and/or viral load do . Results test do within past 2 month use study . Samples CD4 count viral load collect purple top tube . At least 10mls collected participant , gently invert 8-10 time prevent clotting . Whole blood purple top tube store transported temperature 15 30 degree celcius . Results available participant health care giver real time . Viral load measure yearly indicate free patient register Harare hospital opportunistic clinic ( OI ) clinic . This become standard practise country institution viral load machine available . CD4 count measure twice per year patient ART year cost . Resistance test genotyping Participants remain unsuppressed despite DAART adherence counsel proceed resistance test do . A lot study show protease inhibitor high genetic barrier clinically significant mutation . However , rule presence clinically significant PI mutation . Two 4ml whole blood sample collect purple top tube , gently invert 8-10 time prevent clotting . Keeping track sample A log chart available . Each time sample take ( hair blood ) , sample log onto log chart . The date time sample leaf OI clinic record . The date time laboratory receives sample also record log chart . Measurement adherence participant Self-reported adherence measure use AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( ACTG ) adherence follow-up questionnaire ( QLO702 ) visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . These tool validate , find high sensitivity specificity clinical trial . Defining virological immunological treatment failure Treatment failure define accord modify World Health Organization ( WHO ) 2012 criterion : Virological failure - &lt; 1.0 log10 decrease HIV RNA copy number baseline 8-12 week therapy , - HIV RNA ≥1000 copies/mL 6 month therapy Immunological failure Fall CD4 count baseline ( ) OR 50 % fall on-treatment peak value OR Persistent CD4 level 100 cells/mm3 ( Without concomitant infection cause transient CD4 cell decrease ) . Please note- All blood sample label participant 0I number , study number day sample collect . The use identity number mean keep participant ' identity hidden study laboratory personnel prevent sample mix . All sample attach laboratory request form . Study visit schedule Visit 0 Visit 1 90 day DAART ( intervention arm ) 90 day standard care ( SC ) ( control arm ) Visit 2 Visit 3 Eligibility screen Consent assent Enrollment Randomization Adherence questionnaire Participant characteristic questionnaire Hair sample collect Adherence questionnaire Hair sample collect Genotyping eligible participant Study set Harare central hospital arguably large referral hospital Zimbabwe . Because congestion could occur , patient well first line treatment decentralise municipal clinic close patient reside . This move mean decongest hospital , also shorten distance travel patient seek health care , cut transport cost remove technical barrier access health care . However , patient remain unwell fluconazole maintenance treatment second line treatment continue monitor Harare hospital OI clinic . If decentralised patient develop treatment failure fall ill see municipal clinic , refer back Harare hospital OI clinic specialist care . Harare hospital OI clinic situate within paediatric hospital Harare hospital . It open patient Mondays Thursdays , exclude public holiday . The clinic caters child HIV positive 18 year age . Once turn 19 , transfer adult opportunistic infection clinic hospital . On visit clinic , patient commence onto ARVs cotrimoxazole prophylaxis receive maximum 2 month supply . This mean patient enrol clinic return clinic least 2 month drug refill . However , patient take ill concern , free visit clinic see doctor , nurse counsellor outside review date . On present clinic , patient screen nurse whether see doctor give prescription collect medication . Patients require counsel referred counsellor clinic . All patient eventually queue pharmacy OI clinic hand hold hospital record drug supply . Data collection storage Information patient collect 3 source : participant and/or guardian , patient ' hand hold record patient ' hospital record . This move mean ensure information gather accurate possible . Information collect use interviewer base questionnaire keep accessible file . The amount time spend interview minimize much possible . This enable many participant interview avoid delay unnecessarily . Each participant file ( hard copy ) his/her information , include printed questionnaire information , keep fireproof , lockable cupboard department clinical pharmacology , college health science University Zimbabwe . Upon completion study , data keep least 3 year . Only principal investigator co-investigators access soft hard copy data . Data enter research electronic data capture ( REDCap ) software , easy analysis data . Loss follow-up ( LTFU ) A participant consider lose follow-up : 1 . A participant miss 2 consecutive schedule hospital visit 2 . The participant find address provide participant locator form 30 consecutive day 3 . The participant reach phone number provide participant locator form 30 consecutive day 4 . If address provide one know participant relocate participant contact new location When participant decide discontinue participate , guardian decides discontinue child 's participation study , case record withdrawal . In case , withdrawal form fill file participant 's folder . Participants lose follow-up replace . A lost follow-up form fill place participant 's file .</detailed_description>
