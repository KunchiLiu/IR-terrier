	<brief_summary>A prospective , open-label , multicentre phase-II trial evaluate efficacy safety sequential regimen bendamustine follow ofatumumab ibrutinib follow ibrutinib ofatumumab maintenance CLL patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Regimen Bendamustin-Debulking Followed Ofatumumab Ibrutinib CLL Patients ( CLL2-BIO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In CLL2-BIO trial allcomer CLL population indication treatment include . Patient receive 2 cycle debulking treatment bendamustin unless contraindication exist debulking indicate . Afterwards 6 cycle induction therapy ofatumumab ibrutinib apply , duration 28 day . Primary endpoint overall Response rate assess final restaging . Patients benefit BIO treatment enter maintenance phase trial . Maintenance treatment continue unacceptable toxicity occur three month negativity minimal residual disease ( MRD ) achieve peripheral blood patient ( clinical ) complete response ( CR ) ( clinical ) incomplete complete response ( CRi ) confirm 2 consecutive testing MRD within 3 month , progression CLL , start subsequent therapy 8 cycle maintenance ( cycle duration 84 calendar day = 3 month ) , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
