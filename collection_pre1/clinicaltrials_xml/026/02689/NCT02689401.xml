	<brief_title>MRI Iron Oxide Imaging Lymph Node Staging Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Pilot clinical trial , first time investigator examine study intervention . This study test safety investigational intervention ( MRI image Ferumoxytol ) assess feasibility identify malignant lymph node ( lymph node tumor ) compare experimental MRI finding final pathology report surgery . This iron-based agent currently approval U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use iron replacement therapy , however , use MRI image FDA-approved thus experimental trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants may histologically confirm esophageal cancer lesion suspicious esophageal cancer deem surgically resectable . Patients eligible trial may previously complete neoadjuvant chemoradiation per standard protocol prior MRI imaging , without limitation dose , duration type prior treatment focus current study . Eligible patient must 18 year old order consent trial . Individuals age 18 exclude safety study include dose adverse event data population currently available . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients known allergy hypersensitivity reaction parenteral iron , parenteral dextran , parenteral irondextran , parenteral ironpolysaccharides Individuals pregnant lactating . As part routine preoperative testing , woman child bear age receive pregnancy test . The research staff follow result order determine eligibility . Women hysterectomy menses &gt; 24 month require undergo pregnancy test . Pregnant woman exclude study unknown risk associate Ferumoxytol ( US FDA Risk Category C : control study woman , study available either animal woman ) . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother , breastfeed woman exclude study Iron saturation upper limit normal Individuals know clinical condition may lead iron overload include hemochromatosis , cirrhosis , sickle cell disease Individuals contraindication MRI , presence metallic prosthesis implant metal device ( e.g . infusion pump , defibrillator )</criteria>
