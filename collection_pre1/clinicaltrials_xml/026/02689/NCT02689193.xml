	<brief_summary>The IDIS study aim develop new rapid diagnostic test invasive salmonellosis use sample ( blood , urine ) collect patient fever healthy control Institute Tropical Medicine ( ITM ) collaborating center . The sample collect informed consent and/or assent give participant store -80 ⁰C freezer processing ( centrifugation and/or aliquoting ) . Basic information regard patient sample cod store protected Microsoft Access database . The sample ship Belgium proteomic analysis . Identification Salmonella specific protein sample hopefully support development rapid diagnostic test . Once test develop , sample also use validation evaluation test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim project identification Salmonella specific protein detect sample derive host ( = human ) acute infection . This support development rapid test improve diagnosis invasive Salmonellosis . The study take place travel clinic Institute Tropical Medicine Antwerp , Belgium , Sihanouk Hospital Center HOPE Phnom Penh , Cambodia . It plan start 2016 Centre Hospitalier de Kingasani Kinshasa , Democratic Republic Congo collaboration Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale Kinshasa , Democratic Republic Congo . The expected number participant total 2500 . Patients ( child and/or adult ) presenting ( history ) fever ask permission ( informed consent and/or assent ) draw additional blood sample ( along routine care sample , need additional venipuncture ) , long term storage sample ( whole blood plasma ) freezer together left-over serum urine sample . They also ask permission collection cod data include basic demographic , clinical laboratory data . Blood plasma urine centrifugate . All sample aliquoted cryotubes ( coded labelling ) storage -80 ⁰C freezer . Depending final diagnosis , patient divide 4 group : 1 . Patients blood culture grow Salmonella specie 2 . Patients blood culture grow pathogen 3 . Patients blood culture grow another pathogen 4 . Healthy control The frozen sample collect Cambodia Democratic Republic Congo ship Belgium . All selection sample collect undergo proteomic analysis researcher Institute Tropical Medicine collaboration Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie cod data related sample share partner . Once test develop , sample also use validation evaluation test .</detailed_description>
