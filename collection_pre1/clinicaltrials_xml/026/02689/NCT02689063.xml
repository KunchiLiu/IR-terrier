	<brief_title>Maxigesic IV Phase 3 Bunionectomy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AFT Pharmaceuticals Ltd. develop fixed-dose combination acetaminophen 1000mg ibuprofen 300mg/100mL solution infusion ( Maxigesic IV ) temporary relief postoperative pain , administration intravenous route clinically justified urgent need treat pain hyperthermia and/or rout administration possible . A phase 3 efficacy study ( AFT-MXIV-07 ) propose determine analgesic effect fix dose combination product Maxigesic IV versus individual component ( acetaminophen IV ibuprofen IV ) placebo participant acute post-operative pain bunionectomy . The primary efficacy objective determine efficacy Maxigesic IV , acetaminophen IV , Ibuprofen IV versus placebo IV measure sum pain intensity difference ( SPID ) ( calculate time-weighted average ) 0-48 hour ( SPID-48 ) time 0 . Other secondary efficacy endpoint : VAS Pain intensity difference ( PID ) schedule assessment time point Time 0 VAS Pain intensity score schedule assessment time point VAS SPID 0 6 hour ( SPID-6 ) , 0 12 hour ( SPID-12 ) , 0 24 hour ( SPID-24 ) Time 0 Summed pain relief ( TOTPAR ) ( calculate time-weighted average ) 0 6 hour ( TOTPAR-6 ) , 0 12 hour ( TOTPAR-12 ) , 0 24 hour ( TOTPAR-24 ) Time 0 , 0 48 hour ( TOTPAR-48 ) Time 0 Time onset analgesia ( measured time perceptible pain relief confirm meaningful pain relief ) use two-stopwatch method Pain relief score 5-point categorical scale schedule time point Time 0 Peak pain relief Time peak pain relief Time first perceptible pain relief Time meaningful pain relief Proportion subject use rescue medication Time first use rescue medication ( duration analgesia ) Total use rescue analgesia 0 24 hour 0 48 hour Patient 's global evaluation study drug</detailed_description>
