	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate modulatory effect repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) functional connectivity insula . Functional connectivity ( FC ) measure interaction brain region , recent neuroimaging study use FC investigate addiction affect FC among pertinent brain region . rTMS , excite cortical neuron , show promise method manipulate brain connectivity could use therapeutically treat addiction . However , investigator first need information brain FC relate behavior , order guide rTMS target selection .</brief_summary>
