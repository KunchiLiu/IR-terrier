	<brief_summary>Background : Dystonia movement disorder person muscle contract . This cause different part body twist turn . The cause movement unknown . Researchers think may chemical call acetylcholine . They want learn acetylcholine brain work properly people dystonia . Objective : To good understand certain part brain take acetylcholine people dystonia . Eligibility : Adults least 18 year old DYT1 dystonia cervical dystonia . Healthy adult volunteer . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , pregnancy test . Study visit 1 : Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . The MRI scanner metal cylinder strong magnetic field take picture brain . Participants lie table slide cylinder . Study visit 2 : Participants positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . The PET scanner shape like doughnut . Participants lie bed slide scanner . A small amount radioactive chemical detect PET scanner give IV line measure brain take acetylcholine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dystonia heterogeneous group movement disorder characterize abnormal muscle contraction result abnormal posture movement . The spectrum dystonia include focal , segmental , multifocal , generalized presentation broad range age onset . An example focal dystonia cervical dystonia . The pathophysiology dystonia unclear , prior neuroimaging neuropathological study identify role basal ganglion . In neuroimaging study , microstructural change basal ganglion find voxel base morphometry ( VBM ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , abnormal basal ganglion metabolism see image fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) various type dystonia . Basal ganglia pathology observe , include case series report neuronal loss striatum . There evidence implicate basal ganglion dystonia study animal model . In animal model , experimental lesion basal ganglion induce dystonia . An abnormality cholinergic neurotransmission also suggest clinical response antimuscarinic medication . The striatum site acetylcholine synthesis , express muscarinic receptor . While antimuscarinic medication useful symptomatic treatment dystonia , role muscarinic acetylcholine neurotransmission dystonia unclear . Objective The objective application determine role play major basal ganglion neurotransmitter , acetylcholine , pathophysiology primary dystonia . The central hypothesis cholinergic neurotransmission deficient striatum dystonia . Study Population We plan examine one group patient form primary dystonia ( cervical dystonia ) compare healthy volunteer without history neurological psychiatric disorder . Design This case-control study . Using neuroimaging technique , position emission tomography ( PET ) , central hypothesis test pursue one specific aim : map M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor bind cervical dystonia measure PET use [ 18F ] FP-TZTP . Outcome Measures This study determine cholinergic neurotransmitter receptor bind patient cervical dystonia compare healthy control . This propose research study expect advance understanding pathophysiology dystonia order identify possible target potential pharmacological treatment dystonia monitor disease progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy research volunteer adult patient cervical dystonia eligible study . 1 . Adult patient cervical dystonia clinically document cervical dystonia establish history physical/neurological examination . Cervical dystonia patient must receive botulinum toxin injection neck muscle least 3 month time study participation 2 . Healthy volunteer healthy subject without neurological psychiatric disorder establish history physical/neurological examination . 3 . All participant least 18 year age . There maximum age limit . 4 . Participants must able abstain tobacco nicotine replacement least 3 day prior PET scan participate MRI PET scanning.. 5 . Participants must able abstain caffeine least 24 hour prior PET scan participate MRI PET scan . 6 . Participants must able fast 3 hour PET scan participanting MRI PET scan . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects incapable give informed consent . 2 . Employees NINDS 3 . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Aside history obtain screening , pregnancy status woman childbearing potential also establish urine pregnancy test 24 hour MRI PET scan session . 4 . Subjects past present medical history ( ) neurological disorder , stroke , movement disorder ( cervical dystonia patient group ) , brain tumor , traumatic brain injury loss consciousness last second , ataxia , myopathy , myasthenia gravis , demyelinate disease , alcoholism , drug dependence ; ( b ) psychiatric disorder , schizophrenia , major depressive and/or bipolar disorder , obsessivecompulsive disorder ; ( c ) ventricular arrhythmia , renal hepatic insufficiency , vascular headache , carcinoid syndrome . 5 . Abnormalities neurological examination typically associated cervical dystonia , abnormalities neurological examination healthy volunteer . 6 . Subjects currently take oral medication know affect muscarinic acetylcholine receptor bind central nervous system . Of note , overthe countermedications know affect muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding . Subjects use medication know affect muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding , first generation antihistamine common cold allergy symptom sleep aid insomnia , occasionally need basis may enrol study . Furthermore , need medication pause least 3 day PET scan . This threeday period equivalent 4 5 half life medication . In addition , subject use topical antimuscarinic medication , eye drop glaucoma inhaler , may enrol study topical antimuscarinic medication negligible systemic bioavailability . Subjects contraindication MRI , ferromagnetic object body ( e.g. , implanted stimulators include deep brain stimulation , aneurysm clip , prosthesis , artificial heart valve , etc . ) remove purpose study participation . 7 . Subjects claustrophobia . 8 . Subjects unable lie comfortably back one hour MRI scanning ( two hour PET scan participate MRI PET scan ) . 9 . Subjects radiation exposure past year , together research PET scan , would exceed NIH Radiation Safety Committee annual limit ( 5 rem ) participate MRI PET scan . 10 . Cervical dystonia patient cervical dystonia associate trauma</criteria>
