Control Population : The investigator utilize historical control use newly refer patient EMPOWER clinic score negative YFAS-c. Methods Data Analysis : All outcome variable compare intervention use paired t-tests . Further analysis compare result W8Loss2Go program contemporary anthropomorphic change patient undergo standard care EMPOWER program , use two sample t-tests . Significance : This study evaluate feasibility implement mHealth intervention large clinic set explore role food addiction specific weight loss therapy effective sustainable weight management strategy child adolescent .</detailed_description>
