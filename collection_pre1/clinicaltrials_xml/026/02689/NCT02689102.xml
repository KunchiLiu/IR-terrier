	<brief_summary>Often , assess classify diagnosis patient interstitial lung disease provide diagnostic challenge . Currently HRCT , endoscopic surgical video assist thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) assessment include lung biopsy diagnostic tool patient suspect ILD . However , tissue acquisition associate morbidity patient already compromise pulmonary function . In clinical practice result fact minor part patient indication tissue acquisition actually undergoing biopsy . The aim study determine ILD-characteristics imagign collect minimal invasive novel optical technique , examine whether addition novel optical technique diagnostic process ILD could potentially limit need tissue- ( surgical ) diagnosis and/or reduce sample error rate biopsy provide additional information biopsy location .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy Optical Coherence Tomography Diagnosing ILD .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel probe base optical technique Confocal laser endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) Optical coherence tomography ( pOCT ) non-invasive optical technique , compatible conventional diagnostic bronchoscope provide non-invasive , real-time information airway wall alveolar compartment . Therefore , immediate validation optical measurement biopsy possible . Optical technique might either obviate need tissue biopsy improve diagnostic yield conventional biopsy method make surgical lung biopsy associate high morbidity cost redundant . Hypothesis : Novel optical technique ( pCLE pOCT ) provide real time information characteristic mucosa and/or alveolar compartment ILD .</detailed_description>
