	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination enzalutamide paclitaxel help control triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) shrink tumor breast and/or lymph node surgically remove . The safety treatment combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IIB Neoadjuvant Enzalutamide ( ZT ) Plus Taxol Androgen Receptor ( AR ) -Positive Triple-Negative Breast Cancer ( AR+ TNBC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take enzalutamide mouth every day 12 study cycle . Each cycle 7 day ( 1 week ) . On Day 1 cycle , receive paclitaxel vein 2 hour . If side effect , study doctor may decide low study drug dose level stop take drug short time . If dosing stop , may able restart study drug later dose low dose . The study doctor discus . Study Visits : Before treatment begin , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect biomarker testing ( include genetic biomarkers ) . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate reaction study drug . On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycle 7 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw CTC biomarker test . Any time 12 study cycle , may image scan ( one perform Screening ) check status disease , doctor think need . At end 12 cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test , CTC test , biomarker test . - You image scan breast lymph node check status disease . After 12 cycle study drug study , may surgery remove tumor ( ) . You give surgery consent form describe procedure risk . If surgery , may still lymph node biopsy removal , base standard care . Your doctor discus . Leftover tissue/blood study test bank MD Anderson . Before sample use research , researcher must get approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) MD Anderson . The IRB committee doctor , researcher , community member . The IRB responsible protect study participant make sure research safe ethical . Your sample give code number . No identify information directly link sample . Only researcher charge bank access code number able link sample . This allow medical data relate sample update need . Length Treatment : You may receive 12 cycle chemotherapy . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up : Within 30 day ( +/- 3 day ) surgery/biopsy , follow-up visit . During visit , ask , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer respond chemotherapy . Enzalutamide FDA-approved breast cancer . It currently use research purpose breast cancer patient . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 37 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
