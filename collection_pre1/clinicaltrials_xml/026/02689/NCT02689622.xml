	<brief_summary>No prospective study conduct elderly patient cancer assess relative value disease-related patient-related prognosis factor . Patient-related prognostic factor highlight elderly patient cancer result necessity geriatric assessment . The impact overall survival factor recognize elderly people cancer remain unknown High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( HR-MDS ) . Therefore information could crucial good select geriatric assessment domain relevant prediction recommend simplify tool stratification geriatric assessment domains thanks predictive value . The main hypothesis patient-related factor well capacity predict survival treatment tolerance disease-related factor HR-MDS age 75 predictive value different among assessment tool allow selection reduce number tool clinical use . To best knowledge estimation predictive value geriatric assessment tool remain unknown explains standardization practice exists . In test tool cohort patient allow compare different tool define minimal optimal geriatric assessment HR-MDS . To determine best strategy geriatric assessment allow second time measure impact use geriatric standardized evaluation compare patients'care prognosis accord use doctor new score . Research outcomes various medical , economic ethic . Medical decision-making improve simplified geriatric assessment ; economic well knowledge geriatric assessment improve treatment toxicity prevention decrease treatment cost . Ethic associate project well knowledge geriatric assessment tool predict survival tolerance treatment could improve choice best supportive care prognosis marker favorable active therapy . This project could induce important modification practice area improve personalized treatment simplification geriatric assessment allow large diffusion hospital clinic .</brief_summary>
