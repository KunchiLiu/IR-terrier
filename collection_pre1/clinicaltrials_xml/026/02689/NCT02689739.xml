	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study compare venous Doppler flow low extremity pregnant woman . Pregnant woman BMI &gt; /= 30 compare BMI &lt; 30 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Ultrasound Predicting Low Lying Placenta Throughout Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Outcome Measurement Ascertainment : Data collect data EPIC UTMB electronic medical record . This information include : 1 . Maternal demographic data , medical , family , personal , social surgical history 2 . Maternal pre-pregnancy weight height 3 . Maternal weight time delivery 4 . Maternal weight post-operative day 1 5 . Gestational age delivery , infant gender , birth weight , placental weight , delivery method , complication 6 week postpartum . Venous hemodynamics obtain use venous duplex ultrasound . 1 . Peak , mean , minimum flow velocity diameter obtain . Calculations venous velocity amplitude , cross-sectional area , shear stress make data collect . Study Procedures : This prospective study use duplex ultrasound technique characterize venous flow obese non-obese pregnant patient . Women consent participate separate study group obese woman ( BMI &gt; /= 30 ) control group non-obese woman ( BMI &lt; 30 ) . These woman admit Labor Delivery management pregnancy . The Doppler US perform trained staff low extremity . The flow data describe measure compare two group . Additional measurement collect hospitalization . Criteria Inclusion Subjects : -Age &gt; /= 18 year age , plan delivery John Sealy Hospital ( JSH ) Criteria Exclusion Subjects : - &lt; 18 year age - Personal history VTE , regardless etiology - Development VTE pregnancy -History thrombophilia , bleed disorder mark varicosity , history recurrent stillbirth , intrauterine growth restriction - Any indication emergency delivery - Known major fetal abnormality genetic syndrome Sources Research Material : The source data use include maternal medical record EPIC well data obtain venous ultrasound . Recruitment Methods Consenting Process : The subject pregnant woman plan delivery JSH . Subjects consent study personnel . Patients receive monetary gain . They understand voluntary affect care . Potential Risks : The Doppler velocimetry modality use pregnancy ass presence DVT , thus , safety assess widely study . This pose minimum risk mother fetus . Subject Safety Data Monitoring : This study place subject risk safety . This modality well study safe pregnancy . Data monitoring perform study personnel . Data may assess prior study complete assess see statistical analysis reveals difference study stop early . Procedures Maintain Confidentiality : Data view study personnel . The data de-identified study number assign patient . The patient 's identity secure UTMB encrypt laptop device hard copy store lock file cabinet lock office investigator . Potential Benefits : There benefit subject participate study . By gather information duplex velocimetry obese non-obese population determine change velocimetry risk population .</detailed_description>
