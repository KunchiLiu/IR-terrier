	<brief_summary>A broken hip occur frequently elderly patient often painful . Side effect inadequately treat pain well traditional drug ( administer intravenous catheter ) use treat pain , among others , confusional state , call delirium . When pain medication administer locally , around hip joint , pain might treat effectively side effect could prevent . This call nerve block . The current study evaluate use continuous nerve block throughout complete hospital admission catheter around hip joint versus use traditionally use pain medication administer though intravenous catheter elderly patient broken hip . Half patient receive nerve block emergency department half receive pain medication intravenous access .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Hip fracture occur frequently usually painful . Pain indicator increase risk complication . A significant complication delirium , occur 25 % elderly patient hip fracture . For large proportion , trigger development delirium reach back preoperative phase , polypharmacy ( include opioid use ) inadequately treat pain major risk factor . Delirium associate negative health consequence , increase hospital stay , fall , high mortality , decrease physical cognitive function , re-hospitalization , increase risk dementia increase societal cost . Therefore , pain optimally treat soon possible , however elderly patient pose challenge good pain treatment , physiological age-related change , different drug effect , distribution , metabolism elimination . Opioids frequently lead respiratory depression , hypotension , nausea/vomiting sedation vulnerable patient group . As consequence , drug often dose pain treat insufficiently . Besides , drug opioids NSAIDs associate increase delirium risk . A nerve block could alleviate clinical issue . An example nerve block frequently utilized Emergency Department ( ED ) Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block ( FICB ) , local anesthetic inject underneath pelvic iliac fascia order block femoral , obturator lateral cutaneous nerve provide anesthesia hip , thigh knee . Case-series historically control cohort study show single-shot FICB rapid , safe easy procedure provide excellent analgesia , decrease opioid need little risk complication . Delirium outcome report one RCT ; decrease delirium incidence use repetitive , blind , single-shot FICBs ( acute setting ) pethidine ( increase intrinsic risk develop delirium ) comparison . In order prevent need repetitive insertion , leave catheter would create route order provide continuous analgesia local anesthetic . Two case series describe continuous FICB hip fracture report good pain control decrease length hospital stay without infectious complication . No comparison study do continuous FICB . The objective current study investigate whether use continuous FICB , start early ( ED ) continue throughout complete clinical course hip fracture , decrease occurrence delirium elderly patient hip fracture . METHODS This study design prospective , open , multi-center , randomized interventional trial . Patients allocate continuous FICB care usual ( accord national guideline ) 1:1 ratio follow three month hospital discharge . SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSIS The primary outcome ( occurrence delirium ) expect distribute normally . Although evidence prevent delirium scarce , absolute reduction 13 % incidence report previously intervention . The estimated delirium incidence accord literature 25 % . The hypothesis use continuous FICB administer early clinical course ED , incidence decrease 25 12 % . Superiority FICB versus usual care test use Chi Square Test . In order detect clinically relevant between-group-difference 13 % decrease incidence , significance level 0.05 80 % power use . For analysis , group 154 patient . When account 10 % loss follow-up three month , total study population 340 need . The primary analysis base intention treat principle . Per protocol analysis perform check robustness result . Baseline characteristic present use descriptive statistic . Ordinal data analyze use Chi Square Test Fisher exact test . Continuous data assess Student 's t-test normally distribute Mann Whitney U test otherwise . Missing data correct multiple imputation . An economic evaluation perform focus possible gain benefit pain management continuous FICB compare care usual relate health care cost . The economic evaluation perform societal perspective time horizon three month capture value resource utilize . The economic evaluation set Cost-Effectiveness Analysis ( CEA ) . Besides CEA , Budget Impact Analysis ( BIA ) perform accord ISPOR Task Force principle .</detailed_description>
