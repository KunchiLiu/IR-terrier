	<brief_title>Therapy Early Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ( CML ) With Dasatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take dasatinib tablet mouth one ( 1 ) time day . You take dose dasatinib meal . The dose dasatinib receive may change study doctor think best interest . Study Visits : Every 1-2 week first 4 week , every 2-6 week first 3 month , every 3 month Year 1 , every 3-6 month Year 2 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You may blood draw less often , study doctor think need . If convenient study doctor agree , may able blood draw physical exam perform local lab doctor closer home . The result test send study doctor MD Anderson review . The study doctor discus option . At Months 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , physical exam blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check status disease . After first year , physical exam every 6-12 month . You may also call ask side effect . Each phone call take 5 minute . Length Study : You may continue take dasatinib 15 year . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study last dose study drug . This investigational study . Dasatinib FDA approve commercially available treatment CML . It consider investigational give low dose dasatinib treat CML . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 100 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis Phpositive BCRABL positive CML early chronic phase CML ( i.e. , time diagnosis 12 month ) . Except hydroxyurea , patient must receive minimal prior therapy , define &lt; 1 month ( 30 day ) prior FDA approve TKI . 2 . Clonal evolution define presence additional chromosomal abnormality Ph chromosome historically include criterion accelerate phase . However , patient clonal evolution criterion accelerate phase significantly well prognosis , present diagnosis may impact prognosis . Thus , patient clonal evolution criterion accelerate phase eligible study . 3 . ECOG performance 02 . 4 . Adequate end organ function , define follow : total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x ULN , SGPT &lt; 2.5x ULN , creatinine &lt; 1.5x ULN . 5 . 4.4 Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study , keep policy hospital . 1 . NYHA cardiac class 34 heart disease 2 . Cardiac Symptoms : Patients meet follow criterion eligible unless cleared Cardiology : 1 . Uncontrolled angina within 3 month . 2.Diagnosed suspect congenital long QT syndrome . 3 . Any history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , Torsades de pointes ) . 4 . Prolonged QTc interval preentry electrocardiogram ( &gt; 460 msec ) . 5.History significant bleed disorder unrelated cancer , include : Diagnosed congenital bleeding disorder ( e.g. , von Willebrand 's disease ) Diagnosed acquire bleed disorder within one year ( e.g. , acquire antifactor VIII antibody ) 3 . Patients active , uncontrolled psychiatric disorder include : psychosis , major depression , bipolar disorder . 4 . Women pregnancy potential must practice effective method birth control course study , manner risk failure minimize . Prior study enrollment , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Women must continue birth control duration trial least 3 month last dose study drug . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude . All WOCBP must negative pregnancy test prior first receive investigational product . If pregnancy test positive , patient must receive investigational product must enrol study . 5 . Patients late chronic phase ( i.e. , time diagnosis treatment &gt; 12 month ) , accelerate blast phase exclude . The definition CML phase follow : a.Early chronic phase : time diagnosis therapy 12 month . Late chronic phase : time diagnosis therapy &gt; 12 month . b. Blastic phase : presence 30 % blast peripheral blood bone marrow . c.Accelerated phase CML : presence follow feature : • Peripheral marrow blast 15 % • Peripheral marrow basophils 20 % • Thrombocytopenia &lt; 100 x 109/L unrelated therapy • Documented extramedullary blastic disease outside liver spleen</criteria>
