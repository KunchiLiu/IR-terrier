High ESA dose : An epoetin dose &gt; =360 international unit ( IU ) /kilogram ( kg ) /week IV &gt; =250 IU/kg/week subcutaneous ( SC ) darbepoetin dose &gt; =1.8 microgram ( mcg ) /kg/week IV SC methoxy PEGepoetin beta dose &gt; = 2.2 mcg/kg/week within prior 8 week Day 1 ( randomization ) . Administration methoxy PEGepoetin beta within prior 4 week Day 1 ( randomization ) . Myocardial infarction acute coronary syndrome : Within 8 week prior Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Stroke transient ischemic attack : Within 8 week prior Screening though Day 1 ( randomization ) . Heart failure : Class IV heart failure , define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system diagnose prior Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Correction QT Interval use Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) : QTcB &gt; 500 millisecond ( msec ) QTcB &gt; 530 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . There correction QT Interval ( QTc ) exclusion subject predominantly pace rhythm . Inflammatory disease : Active chronic inflammatory disease could impact erythropoiesis ( e.g. , scleroderma , systemic lupus erythematosis , rheumatoid arthritis , celiac disease ) diagnose prior Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Hematological disease : Any hematological disease include affect platelet , white red blood cell ( e.g. , sickle cell anemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , hematological malignancy , myeloma , hemolytic anemia thalassemia ) , coagulation disorder ( e.g. , antiphospholipid syndrome , Protein C S deficiency ) , cause anemia chronic disease renal disease diagnose prior Screening though Day 1 ( randomization ) .

Severe allergic reaction : History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction hypersensitivity excipients investigational product Drugs supplement : Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement prohibit ( per protocol ) Screening Followup Visit . Prior investigational product exposure : The Subject participate clinical trial receive experimental investigational product within prior 30 day Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Other condition : Any condition , clinical laboratory abnormality , examination find investigator considers would put subject unacceptable risk , may affect study compliance prevent understand aim investigational procedure possible consequence study . Females ONLY : A female subject eligible participate pregnant [ confirm positive serum human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test female reproductive potential ( FRP ) ] , breastfeeding , reproductive potential agree follow one option list GSK Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy FRP .
