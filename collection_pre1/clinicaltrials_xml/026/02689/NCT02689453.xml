	<brief_summary>Background : Adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) rare blood cancer . Researchers want see combination two drug - recombinant human interleukin 15 ( rhIL-15 ) alemtuzumab - well treatment ATL . Objectives : To test give rhIL-15 combine alemtuzumab improves outcome therapy ATL . Also , determine safe dose combination identify side effect effect immune system . Eligibility : Adults 18 year old chronic acute ATL help treatment . Design : Participants screen test mostly part usual cancer care . They sign separate consent form . Weeks 1 2 : Participants total 10 visit . They : - Get rhIL-15 skin needle . - Have physical exam vital sign measure . - Give blood sample . - Answer question health medicine . Week 3 : Participants stay clinic . They : - Get alemtuzumab infusion vein small catheter day 1 , 2 , 3 , 5.. - Take medicine decrease side effect . - Have compute tomography ( CT ) scan evaluate treatment . - Have physical exam vital sign measure . - Give blood sample . Answer question health medicine . Weeks 4 , 5 , 6 repeat week 3 , without CT scan . Some patient outpatient visit week . After treatment , participant follow-up visit every month 2 year . At visit , participant give blood sample CT scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - A previously report Lymphoid Malignancies Branch ( LYMB ) trial administer alemtuzumab ( CAMPATH-1 ) patient chronic , acute lymphomatous subtype HTLV-1 associate ATL show appreciable initial activity clear long-term impact . - Overall response rate 52 % ( n=15 ) 29 patient . - Median duration response 3.4 month . - Median overall survival 5.9 month . - Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) polymorphonuclear neutrophil ( PMNs ) , monocytes natural killer ( NK ) cell act effector cell alemtuzumab primary vivo mechanism action deplete malignant leukemic lymphomatous cell . - The immunologic effect Interleukin-15 ( IL-15 ) , stimulatory cytokine promote differentiation activation NK cell , monocytes long-term CD8+ memory Tcells , assess several phase I trials cancer patient . - Administration recombinant human ( rh ) IL-15 intravenous bolus ( IVB ) , continuous intravenous infusion ( CIV ) subcutaneous injection ( SC ) adult cancer patient produce 5 50 fold expansion number circulate NK cell well tolerated dos patient . - Preclinical murine lymphoid malignancy model show efficacy administration IL-15 monoclonal antibody . - In syngeneic model , immunocompetent mouse bear EL4 cell line transfected human CD20 show increase ADCC improve survival mouse treat IL-15 rituximab compare mice treat either agent alone control . - In xenograft human MET-1 model , mice treat alemtuzumab IL-15 also improve survival . Objective : -Determine safety , toxicity profile maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) s.c. rhIL-15 administered combination standard three time per week IV alemtuzumab treatment . Eligibility : - Age great equal 18 year old - ECOG Performance Status less equal 1 - Diagnosis chronic acute adult T-cell leukemia - ATL ( CD3lowCD4+ CD25high ) cell express CD52 - Measurable evaluable disease ( patient &gt; 10 % circulate lymphocyte classic ATL CD3low CD4+ CD25+ phenotype consider measureable ) - Normal organ bone marrow function Design : - This single institution nonrandomized Phase I dose escalation study evaluate increase dos SC rhIL-15 combination alemtuzumab use standard 3 + 3 dose escalation . - Treatment Schedule - rhIL-15 week 1 2 ( s.c. Monday Friday ) dosing cohort . - Alemtuzumab initiation dose week 3 ( day 1 : 3mg , day 2 : 10mg , day 3 : 30mg day 5 : 30mg IV 2 hour ) . The escalate dos indicate arrow Schema . - Standard alemtuzumab week 4 , 5 , 6 : 30 mg three time week ( Monday , Wednesday Friday . ) - rhIL-15 dose level - Cohort 1-1 mcg/kg/dose - Cohort 2-2 mcg/kg/dose - Cohort 3-3 mcg/kg/dose - Up 24 patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
