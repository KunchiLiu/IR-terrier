	<brief_title>Post-radiation Hypothyroidism After IMRT Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient include previously untreated non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) receive one course radical IMRT without adjunct chemotherapy NPC curative treatment . Patients history thyroid disorder , pituitary disorder , prior thyroid surgery drug history thyroxine ( T4 ) triiodothyronine ( T3 ) exclude . Patients history radiation therapy area also exclude . Pretreatment investigation workup include serum hematology , biochemistry , antibodies Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) viral capsid antigen ( VCA ) early antigen ( EA ) , fabrication customize head neck thermoplastic cast subsequent contrast-enhanced compute tomography ( CT ) scan head neck region mid-thoracic region IMRT treatment position 3mm thickness , well T1-sequence , T2-sequence gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head neck region 3-tesla scanner image co-registered plan head neck CT image detailed target organ-at-risk ( OAR ) delineation IMRT planning . A separate contrast-enhanced CT scan thorax abdomen also perform rule distant metastasis . The gross tumour volume primary tumour ( GTV-P ) radiologically involved cervical node ( GTV-N ) outline plan CT image aid co-registered MRI image . Subsequently clinical target volume ( CTV-70 ) plan target volume contain CTV-70 3mm margin ( PTV-70 ) generate take account microscopic disease spread , physiological body motion set-up error respectively . Another CTV-66 encompassing high risk area include posterior half maxillary sinus , nasal cavity , parapharyngeal space , styloid process , basi-occiput , basi-sphenoid , clivus , foramina rotunda ovale , pterygopalatine fossa , pterygomaxillary fissure , infra-orbital fissure , cavernous sinus level Ib level V nodal station also contour . A corresponding PTV-66 3mm margin encompass CTV-66 create boolean operation treatment planning system also use IMRT optimization planning . All OARs include brainstem , spinal cord , globe , optic nerve , optic chiasm , lenses , temporomandibular joint , temporal lobe , auditory nerve , cochlea , mandible , oral cavity , larynx , parotid gland , vestibule , pituitary thyroid contour manually . During IMRT optimization , maximum dose brainstem , optic nerve chiasm must &lt; =54 Gy ( allow 0.1cc brainstem &lt; 60 Gy ) spinal cord &lt; =45 Gy ( allow 0.1cc spinal cord &lt; 48 Gy ) . Efforts also make limit mean dose parotid glands 26 Gy whenever possible dose lenses temporal lobe low reasonably achieve without compromise dose coverage PTVs . No dose constraint give thyroid pituitary optimization IMRT plan . A 7 9 field IMRT plan deliver step-and-shoot technique 6-megavoltage linear accelerator generate Eclipse Treatment Planning System . A total dose 70 Gy 66 Gy prescribe PTV-70 PTV-66 respectively , 33 35 fraction 6.5 7 week simultaneous accelerate radiation therapy technique ( SMART ) . The whole neck irradiate IMRT match anterior field lower neck note . This standard prescription practice institution past 10 year . Positional verification on-board image perform IMRT commencement . It repeat daily immediately first 3 fraction IMRT weekly afterwards whole course IMRT , track anteroposterior lateral body displacement . All patient routine 6-site nasopharyngeal biopsy 8 week IMRT confirm local clinical remission . Repeated nasopharyngeal biopsy perform 10 week 12 week IMRT residual tumour cell still observe previous post-IMRT nasopharyngeal biopsy . Additional radiation therapy form intracavitary brachytherapy , stereotactic radiation therapy IMRT would give patient develop local persistence 12 week IMRT . For patient confirm local clinical remission , receive regular clinical follow image surveillance every 3 4 month 1st year IMRT , every 4 6 month 2nd 3rd year yearly afterwards monitor treatment-related chronic complication relapse . Blood test thyroid function test include free T4 thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) arrange least yearly monitor post-IMRT hypothyroidism . Biochemical hypothyroidism define either elevation TSH upper normal limit reduce free T4 low normal limit , without presence clinical symptom hypothyroidism . Clinical hypothyroidism define presence biochemical abnormality thyroid function define biochemical hypothyroidism together presence clinical symptom hypothyroidism . Those found clinical hypothyroidism receive thyroxine supplement start 50 microgram daily repeat serum thyroid function test 2 3 month later follow dose titration necessary , every 6 12 month thereafter therapeutic dosage reach . Univariable multivariable binary logistic regression perform dosimetric predictor biochemical clinical hypothyroidism . All statistical analysis perform Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) statistical significance define p-value &lt; 0.05 ( two-sided ) .</detailed_description>
