	<detailed_description>First degree relative woman PCOS 3-4 fold increase prevalence syndrome compare general population , suggest inherit genetic predisposition . Many investigation possible candidate gene PCOS susceptibility hypothesise incomplete penetrance dominant gene , although consensus achieve exact genetic polymorphism may culpable . Primate study offer credence theory genomic imprinting influence environmental hyperandrogenism hypothesis intra-uterine exposure excess androgen cause PCOS gain momentum ( Abbott et al , 2010 ) . At birth , mother neonate influence identical hormone profile , therefore expect sebum excretion rate ( correlate androgen excess ) high neonate bear mother PCOS compare without . This would account observed familial transition PCOS ( Legro et al , 1998 ; Vink et al , 2006 ) , support hypothesis in-utero hyperandrogenism prime differentiate tissue later expression PCOS phenotype adolescence .</detailed_description>
