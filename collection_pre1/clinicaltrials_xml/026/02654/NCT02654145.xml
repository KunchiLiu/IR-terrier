	<brief_summary>Mepolizumab anti-interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) monoclonal antibody neutralize IL-5 reduces eosinophil count sputum blood . Omalizumab anti-immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) effective treatment moderate severe allergic asthma . The aim study investigate whether subject optimally control current omalizumab treatment , eligible therapy mepolizumab effectively safely switched treatment mepolizumab improve asthma control . The study provide data efficacy , safety , immunogenicity , tolerability mepolizumab switch directly omalizumab without wash-out . The learning study may help guide physician substitute one biologic another treatment patient severe eosinophilic asthma . The study multi-centre , open-label single arm trial . Patients severe eosinophilic asthma receive omalizumab , optimally control eligible participate . Subjects remain current maintenance therapy include omalizumab throughout run-in period minimum one week 4 week . At Visit 2 ( week 0 ) subject discontinue omalizumab treatment switch mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneous ( SC ) every 4 week 28 week . The treatment period 32 week , include Exit Visit/Early Withdrawal Visit , 4 week follow subject 's last dose mepolizumab .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>At least 12 year age time sign informed consent . For country local regulation permit enrolment adult , subject recruitment restrict &gt; = 18 year age . Asthma : A physician diagnosis asthma &gt; =2 year meet National Heart Lung Institute guideline . Forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) : Persistent airflow obstruction indicate : For subject &gt; =18 year age Visit 1 , prebronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict recorded Visit 1 , For subject 1217 year age Visit 1 , prebronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 90 % predict recorded Visit 1 FEV1/ Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.8 record Visit 1 Eosinophilic asthma : Airway inflammation characterize eosinophilic nature indicate one following : A peripheral blood eosinophil count &gt; =300 cells/microliter ( uL ) relate asthma demonstrate past 12 month prior Visit 1 peripheral blood eosinophil count &gt; =150 cells/uL Visit 1 related asthma . Inhaled Corticosteroid : A welldocumented requirement regular treatment highdose inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) 12 month prior Visit 1 without maintenance oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) . For 18 year age older : ICS dose must &gt; =880 microgram ( ug ) /day fluticasone propionate ( FP ) ( exactuator ) equivalent daily . For ICS/ LongActing Beta2Agonists ( LABA ) combination preparation , high approve maintenance dose local country meet ICS criterion . For subject 1217 year age Visit 1 : ICS dose must &gt; =440 ug/day fluticasone propionate ( FP ) ( exactuator ) equivalent daily , For ICS/LABA combination preparation , high approve maintenance dose local country meet ICS criterion . Controller Medication : Current treatment additional controller medication , besides ICS , least 3 month document failure past 12 month additional controller medication least 3 successive month . [ e.g. , LABA , leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) , theophylline . ] Asthma symptom optimally control : An ACQ5 score &gt; =1.5 record Visit 1 . Omalizumab Treatment : Receiving omalizumab , base weight IgE level , least 4 month prior Visit 1 . Exacerbation history : Previously confirm history two exacerbation require treatment systemic corticosteroid ( intramuscular , intravenous , oral ) 12 month prior Visit 1 despite use highdose ICS . For subject receive omalizumab &gt; =8 month , least one exacerbation must occur omalizumab treatment . For subject receive maintenance oral corticosteroid , corticosteroid treatment exacerbation must twofold dose increase great . Male eligible Female : Females : ) Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : Documented tubal ligation , Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , Hysterectomy , Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy , Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) estradiol level consistent menopause ( refer laboratory reference range confirmatory level ) ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . b ) Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) 30 day prior first dose study medication least five terminal halflives continue pharmacologic effect end , whichever long , last dose study medication completion Exit visit/Early Withdrawal visit.The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Capable give sign informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . Concurrent Respiratory Disease : Presence know preexisting , clinically important lung condition asthma . This include current infection , bronchiectasis , pulmonary fibrosis , bronchopulmonary aspergillosis , diagnose emphysema chronic bronchitis ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma ) history lung cancer . Malignancy : A current malignancy previous history cancer remission le 12 month prior screen ( subject localize carcinoma skin resect cure exclude ) . Liver disease : Subjects must enrol study : At screen ( Visit 1 ) Alanine Transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 2x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) ; bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) Current active liver biliary disease ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) . Stable chronic liver disease generally define absence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminaemia , oesophageal gastric varix , persistent jaundice , cirrhosis . Hepatitis status : Diagnosis chronic hepatitis B , evidence positive Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) Visit 1 . Chronic stable hepatitis C ( e.g. , positive hepatitis C antibody test result screening ( Visit 1 ) within 3 month prior first dose study treatment ) acceptable subject otherwise meet entry criterion . Cardiovascular : Subjects severe clinically significant cardiovascular disease uncontrolled standard treatment . Including limited : ) know ejection fraction &lt; 30 % b ) severe heart failure meet New York Heart Association Class IV classification c ) hospitalise 12 month prior Visit 1 severe heart failure meet New York Heart Association Class III ) angina diagnose less 3 month prior Visit 1 Visit 1 Subjects QT interval correct ( QTc ) &gt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) QTc &gt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block screen Visit 1.The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) , Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) , and/or another method , machineread manually overread . The specific formula use determine eligibility discontinuation individual subject determine prior initiation study . In word , several different formula use calculate QTc individual subject low QTc value use include discontinue subject trial.For purpose data analysis , QTcB , QTcF , another QT correction formula , composite available value QTc use . Other Concurrent Medical Conditions : Subjects know , preexist , clinically significant endocrine , autoimmune , metabolic , neurological , renal , gastrointestinal , hepatic , haematological system abnormality uncontrolled standard treatment .

Adherence : Subjects know evidence lack adherence controller medication and/or ability follow physician 's recommendation . Hypersensitivity : Subjects allergy/intolerance monoclonal antibody biologic . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Investigator opinion : Omalizumab treatment provide significant clinical benefit despite experience 2 exacerbation past 12 month , potential benefit switch mepolizumab would outweigh potential harm omalizumab withdrawal subject . Previous participation : Previously participate study mepolizumab receive investigational product ( include placebo ) . Investigational Medications : Subjects receive treatment investigational drug within past 30 day five terminal phase halflives drug whichever longer , prior Screening ( V1 ) ( also include investigational formulation market product ) .
