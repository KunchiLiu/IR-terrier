	<brief_title>Viral Inhibition Children Treatment RSV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Globally , Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) recognize lead cause respiratory tract infection infant young child major cause hospitalization due severe respiratory infection . Despite four decade effort , still effective method control RSV infection . Treatment RSV limit supportive measure . There urgent need safe effective drug treat prevent RSV disease . AK0529 investigational antiviral agent target RSV fusion protein surface viral envelope exert antiviral activity RSV inhibit viral entry host cell prevent fusion protein induce cell-cell fusion . AK0529 generally well tolerate healthy volunteer . This study design randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter , phase 2 study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , antiviral effect single multiple dose AK0529 infant hospitalize RSV infection . It consist two part , Part 1 Part 2 . Each part consist three phase , pre-treatment phase , treatment phase post-treatment follow-up phase .</detailed_description>

Diagnosis RSV infection virological mean , may include rapid diagnostic pointofcare test , within 96 hour precede screen Part 1 72 hour Part 2 . Patient must weigh &gt; 3 kg screen within 10th 90th percentile ( inclusive ) patient 's age , base local child growth standard , i.e . Australian Paediatric Endocrine Group Growth Charts . The parent / legal guardian patient must provide write informed consent patient participate . For patient age &lt; 12 month , occipitofrontal head circumference within normal range age gender . The patient take , currently take require restrict medication . Patient know HIVpositive ( mother , potential patient child age &lt; 6 month ) . Participation investigational drug device study within 30 day prior date screening . Requires vasopressor inotropic support time enrolment . Concurrent gastrointestinal condition could , opinion investigator , prejudice absorption Investigational Medicinal Product ( e.g . protract vomiting , malabsorption syndrome , history necrotising enterocolitis consequent short gut syndrome ) . Bronchopulmonary dysplasia chronic lung disease require assist ventilation time enrolment . Diminished ventilatory reserve risk hypercapnia ( e.g . pulmonary hypoplasia , sequestration syndrome , cystadenomatoid malformation , history surgery diaphragmatic hernia ) . Left right shunt merit corrective therapy . Renal failure include renal anomaly likely associate renal insufficiency ( e.g . clinical condition renal dysplasia , polycystic renal disease , renal agenesis ) . Clinical evidence hepatic decompensation ( e.g . hepatic disorder associate coagulopathy associate encephalopathy ) . Cerebral palsy microcephaly , chronic persistent feed difficulty seizure . Symptomatic inborn error metabolism ( e.g . mitochondrial disorder , disorder carbohydrate metabolism , glycogen storage disorder ) . Congenital acquire immunodeficiency ( e.g . congenital agammaglobulinaemia , common variable immunodeficiency , immunosuppressive therapy glucocorticoid montelukast therapy form part care direct treat physician ) . For Part 2 study , child history receive palivizumab monoclonal agent direct RSV precede 120 day . This exclusion criterion apply Part 1 . Evidence active uncontrolled respiratory , cardiac , hepatic , central nervous system renal disease unrelated RSV infection baseline medical condition opinion investigator render patient unsuitable enrolment . A history epilepsy seizures include febrile seizure . Allergy test medication constituent . Weight le 10th percentile great 90th percentile age gender adjust prematurity . The patient 's parent legally acceptable representative employee investigator study center , direct involvement propose study study direction investigator study center , family member employee investigator .
