	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) define presence hepatic steatosis ( fat accumulation liver cell ) , either image biopsy absence cause secondary hepatic fat accumulation significant alcohol consumption , medication , hereditary disorder . In majority patient , NAFLD associate risk factor cardiovascular disease obesity , diabetes mellitus , high cholesterol , may lead irreversible liver damage . Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) severe form NAFLD present 30 % obese adult . NASH define hepatic steatosis inflammation hepatocyte injury without fibrosis ( harden liver ) . The prevalence , morbidity mortality NAFLD increasing , particularly Asia-Pacific region estimate 300 million obese people 2030 . Weight loss first-line treatment NAFLD obese individual , utility lifestyle modification diet exercise limited difficulty sustain compliance eventual weight regain . Bariatric ( weight loss ) surgery produce great amount weight loss limit cost , patient acceptance , complication . The efficacy drug NASH , vitamin E medication lower cholesterol glucose , remain unclear . Liraglutide , glucagon-like peptide ( GLP-1 ) analogue , injectable medication show induce weight loss lower glucose obese adult . There little information effect GLP-1 analogue NASH , particularly comparison modality weight loss surgery . This study aim compare efficacy safety lifestyle modification , liraglutide surgery , weight loss conjunction reduce severity NASH , insulin resistance , high cholesterol cardiovascular risk factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Effects Liraglutide Bariatric Surgery Weight Loss , Liver Function , Body Composition , Insulin Resistance , Endothelial Function Biomarkers Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH ) Obese Asian Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The morbidity mortality non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , common liver disease worldwide , rapidly increase result global explosion obesity , particularly Asia-Pacific region estimate 300 million obese people 20302 . Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , subset NAFLD , present 30 % obese adult , lead irreversible liver cirrhosis , associate type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease increase morbidity mortality . Weight loss establish efficacy NASH-associated cardiometabolic abnormality disease activity severity . Diet exercise produce modest effect NASH limit weight regain , even intensive lifestyle modification . Bariatric surgery produce great amount weight loss , less acceptable many patient lifestyle modification medical therapy , limited cost complication , particularly post-surgical malabsorption potential psychological complication . The efficacy previously-studied medication NASH , statins , insulin sensitizer ursodeoxycholic acid , remain unclear . This study therefore aim compare efficacy safety medication induces weight loss reduces insulin resistance , lifestyle modification ( diet exercise ) , bariatric surgery , improvement NASH severity , insulin resistance marker cardiovascular risk . Liraglutide injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) analogue indicate treatment type 2 diabetes adult . It show induce weight loss reduction insulin resistance type 2 diabetic obese patient . Treatment clinically relevant dos liraglutide least 20 week lead weight loss obese patient without type 2 diabetes . However , little information effect GLP-1 analogue NASH , particularly comparison modality weight loss surgery . Our study also compare accuracy magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , current noninvasive reference standard method measure hepatic fat content , liver biopsy stag NASH . Biopsy current gold standard , carry high procedural risk , less convenient acceptable patient non-invasive method evaluate severity activity NASH . Hence liver biopsy week 0 , 26 week 52 optional base patient consent . We also measure biomarkers alter hepatic lipid partition adipokine action , increase oxidative stress free fatty acid lipotoxicity , implicate pathogenesis NAFLD , may useful non-invasive method evaluate severity NASH efficacy treatment .</detailed_description>
