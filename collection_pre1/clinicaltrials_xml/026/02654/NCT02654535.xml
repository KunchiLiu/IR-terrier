	<detailed_description>Background : Peanuts tree nut ( almond , Brazil nut , cashew , hazelnut , macadamia nut , pecan , pine nut , pistachio walnuts ) important source unsaturated fatty acid , vegetable protein , fibre , well mineral , vitamin , phytonutrients . The FDA permit health claim tree nut cardiovascular disease risk reduction cardiovascular benefit nut acknowledge [ FDA , 2015 ; Bao et al. , 2013 ; Sabate et al. , 2010 ] ; however , intake tree nut low Canada . Based 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey ( CCHS ) , &lt; 5 % Canadians consume nut give day mean intake 18 g/day consume nut [ PHAC , 2004 ] . This intake level far 42 g/day amount recommend FDA cardiovascular risk reduction . One barrier increase consumption nut perception may contribute weight gain `` healthy food '' owe high energy density . With rise overweight obesity downstream cardiometabolic complication , heart diabetes association caution consumption nut time recommend heart health [ Sievenpiper et al. , 2013 ; Evert et al. , 2014 ; Anderson et al. , 2013 ] . In series earlier systematic review meta-analyses , show nut improve glycemic control metabolic syndrome criterion , finding run contrary expect weight gain [ Viguiliouk et al. , 2014 ; Blanco Mejia et al. , 2014 ] . Although earlier systematic review meta-analysis control trial show lack effect nut intake body weight [ Flores-Mateo et al. , 2013 ] , remain unclear whether nut increase , neutral , even decrease effect broader set marker adiposity . Need propose research : The lack high quality synthesis knowledge translation reconcile benefit nuts potential weight gain represent urgent call strong evidence . High quality systematic review meta-analyses control trial prospective cohort study represent high level evidence support dietary guideline public health policy development . Objective : The investigator conduct series systematic review meta-analyses ( 1 ) distinguish effect peanut tree nut body weight marker adiposity control trial ( 2 ) ass peanut tree nut consumption incident overweight/obesity change weight marker adiposity prospective cohort study . Design : Each systematic review meta-analysis conduct accord Cochrane Handbook Systematic Reviews Interventions report accord Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) [ Higgins et al. , 2011 ; Moher et al. , 2009 ] . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials ( Clinical Trials ; CENTRAL ) search use appropriate search term supplement hand search reference include study . Study selection : The investigator include either control dietary trial prospective cohort study . Randomized controlled trial investigate effect include and/or exchange nut nutrient change body weight marker adiposity outcomes human include . Studies &lt; 3-weeks diet duration , lack control , assess intake waste conditions/malnourished population , pregnancy lactation exclude . Prospective cohort study include &gt; = 1-year duration ass relation tree nut and/or peanut incident overweight/obesity change body weight marker adiposity . Data extraction : Two investigator independently extract relevant data ass risk bias use Cochrane Risk Bias Tool . All disagreement resolve consensus . Standard computation imputation use derive miss variance data . Outcomes : Three set outcomes assess : ( 1 ) incidence overweight/obesity , ( 2 ) measure global adiposity ( body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , body fat ) , ( 3 ) measure abdominal adiposity ( waist circumference , waist-to-hip ratio , visceral adipose tissue ) . Data synthesis : Mean difference pool trial risk ratio cohort use generic inverse variance method . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Fixed-effects model use &lt; 5 included study . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity assess Cochran Q statistic quantify I2 statistic . To explore source heterogeneity , investigator conduct sensitivity analysis , study systematically remove . If &gt; =10 study , investigator also explore source heterogeneity priori subgroup analysis age ( child [ = &lt; 18 year age ] , adult ) , health status ( metabolic syndrome/diabetes , overweight , normal weight ) , comparator ( carbohydrate , mixed macronutrient , animal protein , ) , nut type , nut dose , baseline measurement , randomization , study design ( parallel , crossover ) , energy balance ( positive , neutral , negative ) , duration follow-up , risk bias . Meta-regression analysis assess significance categorical continuous subgroup analysis . When &gt; =10 study available , publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot formal test use Egger Begg test . If publication bias suspect , investigator attempt adjust funnel plot asymmetry impute miss study data use Duval Tweedie trim fill method . Evidence Assessment : The strength evidence outcome assess use Grading Recommendations Assessment , Development Evaluation ( GRADE ) [ Guyatt et al. , 2011a , 2011b , 2011c , 2011d , 2011e , 2011f , 2011g , 2011h , 2011i ; Balshem et al. , 2011 ; Brunetti et al. , 2013 ; Guyatt et al. , 2013a , 2013b , 2013c ] . Knowledge translation plan : The result disseminate interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Target audience include public health scientific community interest nutrition , diabetes , obesity , cardiovascular disease . Feedback incorporate use improve public health message key area future research define . Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers network among opinion leader increase awareness participate directly committee member development future guideline . Significance : The propose project aid knowledge translation relate role peanut tree nut relation body weight , particular adiposity development overweight obesity , strengthen evidence-base guideline improve health outcome educate healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research design .</detailed_description>
