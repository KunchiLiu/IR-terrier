	<brief_title>Study Induction Hypothyroxinemia Adjunct Conventional Therapies GBM Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since T4 ( thyroxine ) potent growth factor numerous cancer type , interventional approach achieve thyroxine deprivation ( hypothyroxinemia ) .This achieve use dual approach : T3 methimazole provide long term inhibition thyroid hormone synthesis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis GBM , histologically cytologically confirm . Newlydiagnosed subject prior begin firstline conventional therapy . Male female subject 18 year age old . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Ability consent comply completion patient diary . Subjects must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥20 mm ( ≥2 cm ) conventional technique ≥10 mm ( ≥1 cm ) spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . Allowable type amount prior therapy medication ECOG performance status ≤2 ( KPS ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) . Life expectancy great 6 month Subjects must adequate bone marrow , liver renal function assess follow laboratory requirement conduct within 7 day start study treatment : Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 2.5 xULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN subject liver involvement cancer ) . Alkaline phosphatase limit &lt; 2.5 x ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN subject liver involvement cancer ) Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN . Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 accord MDRD ( Modified diet renal disease ) abbreviate formula . INR/PTT &lt; 1.5 x ULN . Platelet count &gt; 100000 /mm3 , Hemoglobin ( Hb ) &gt; 9 g/dl , Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500/mm3 No significant abnormality serum hematology , serum chemistry serum inflammatory / immunogenic marker accord Principal Investigator 's judgment . No significant abnormality urinalysis accord Principal Investigator 's judgment , take consideration potential effect tumor . No significant abnormality ECG per investigator judgment .

Patients unable swallow oral medication . Patients recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day start study medication . Patients receive investigational agent participate another interventional clinical trial within 30 day prior baseline visit ( patient participate observational trial allow enrolled study ) . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition antithyroid agent ( methimazole PTU ) Cytomel® , agent use study . Current prior ( within last 60 day prior screen visit ) use medication substance potential affect activity pharmacokinetics study agent ( please refer package insert study drug ) . Specific noneallowable type amount prior therapy medication Clinically significant concurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , active connective tissue disorder , lupus scleroderma , human immunodeficiency virus psychiatric illness/social situation opinion investigator , could interfere safety , compliance aspect study would limit compliance study requirement . History organ allograft . Nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . Renal failure require hemoor peritoneal dialysis . Pregnant breastfeeding patient .

Evidence alcohol abuse history alcohol abuse illegal and/or legally prescribe drug . Inability attend schedule clinic visit and/or comply study protocol . Any factor , opinion investigator , would prevent patient comply requirement protocol . Any prior abnormality relate thyroid /or intake thyroid relate drug ( e.g Eltroxin ) 3 month prior study start .</criteria>
