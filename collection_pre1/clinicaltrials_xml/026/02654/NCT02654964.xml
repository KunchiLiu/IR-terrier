	<brief_summary>A study determine safety CSC/ HTS-based combination drug therapy subject GBM recur progress follow prior radiation therapy TMZ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cancer Stem Cell High-Throughput Drug Screening Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol describe prospective single-center Phase 0/1 open-label study evaluate safety efficacy high-throughput drug sensitivity assay predict target therapy patient GBM recur progress follow prior radiation therapy TMZ . The underlying hypothesis treatment patient 3 lead candidate identify individualized CSC/ HTS assay safely ( 1 ) delay disease progression , ( 2 ) increase survival . There abundance literature strongly support importance regimen target CSCs prevent tumor recurrence , additional strategy improve overall prognosis cancer patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Determined prescreening : A histological diagnosis GBM [ WHO grade IV ] . Subjects ≥18 year age Signed informed consent tumor collection prior initiation studyspecific procedure . The patient patient 's legal authorize representative must able provide write informed consent ( ICF ) understand potential risk benefit study enrollment treatment Patients must life expectancy &gt; 12 week Determined around surgery , prior perform HTS : Patients must surgically accessible tumor intent gross near total resection tumor mass ( GBM , WHO grade IV ) Collection sufficient tumor material processing CSCs Determined around tumor recurrence , completion HTS : • Disease progression follow radiation TMZ therapy ( define RANO criterion ( 45 ) ; Appendix 3 ) . Unlimited relapse allow , provide functional status eligibility criterion enrollment meet Determined baseline : Signed informed consent CSC/HTS base therapy prior initiation studyspecific procedure treatment . The patient patient 's legal authorize representative must able provide write informed consent ( ICF ) understand potential risk benefit study enrollment treatment Patients must KPS rating ≥70 ( see Appendix 4 : Karnofsky Performance Scale ) Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy &lt; Grade 2 toxicity per NCI CTCAE version 4 ( Appendix 6 ) prior Day 1 Cycle 1 . The minimum duration require prior therapy initiation study drug treatment follow : At least 12 week completion radiation therapy except unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence ( histological confirmation ) case least 4 week completion radiation suffice 4 week prior cytotoxic chemotherapy 4 week prior experimental drug 6 week nitrosoureas 3 week procarbazine 1 week noncytotoxic agent . Subjects must adequate renal , hepatic bone marrow function base screen laboratory assessment . Baseline hematologic study chemistry coagulation profile must meet following criterion : Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; 8 g/dL Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,000/mm3 Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 Creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL Alkaline Phosphatase ( ALP ) , Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 3x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Patients childbearing potential must agree use adequate method contraception duration study , 90 day follow discontinuation study drug Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test Patients must negative HIV , Hepatitis B C Patients cooperative able complete assessment procedure . Any condition , include presence clinically significant laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk participate study confound ability interpret data study Active infection , ( include know Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) Hepatitis C ) within 3 day prior study enrollment Diseases condition obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism Serious intercurrent medical illness ( e.g. , symptomatic congestive heart failure ) Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject provide informed consent unless legal authorize representative consent behalf Inadequately control hypertension ( define systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg ) Prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure History myocardial infarction unstable angina within 6 month History stroke transient ischemic attack within 6 month Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm , require surgical repair recent peripheral arterial thrombosis ) within 6 month History hemoptysis ( ≥ 1/2 teaspoon bright red blood per episode ) within 1 month . Evidence bleed diathesis significant coagulopathy ( absence therapeutic anticoagulation ) . Grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy per NCI CTCAE version 4 History abdominal fistula gastrointestinal ( GI ) perforation within 6 month . Serious , nonhealing wound , active ulcer , untreated bone fracture Allergies reagent use study Women child bear age willing use reliable form contraception Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) lactation Patient positive HIV , Hepatitis B C Concurrent use enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) Patients must discontinue EIAED least two week prior start study drug Concurrent use herbal medication Patient simultaneously participate another clinical trial Phase 1 ( treatment phase ) study . Patients may enroll/consent Phase 0 portion study tissue collection HTS treat standard care clinical trial newly diagnose GBM prior recurrence . Inability unwilling comply protocol study procedure .</criteria>
