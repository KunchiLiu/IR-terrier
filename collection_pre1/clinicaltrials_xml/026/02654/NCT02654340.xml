	<detailed_description>Tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) genetic disorder cause non-malignant tumor form many different organ , primarily brain , eye , heart , kidney , skin lung . The aspect TSC strongly impact quality life generally associate brain : seizure , developmental delay , intellectual disability autism . However , many people TSC live independent , healthy life enjoy challenge profession doctor , lawyer , educator researcher . The incidence severity various aspect TSC vary widely individual even identical twin . Because TSC manifest many different way , diagnosis generally make physician identify two major feature TSC one individual . One major feature cardiac rhabdomyoma , abnormal growth heart muscle generally find young child sometimes find ultrasound examination pregnancy . Other major feature include specific abnormal skin growth skin pigmentation , specific non-malignant tumor growth subependymal nodule subependymal giant cell astrocytomas ( SEGAs ) brain , lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) lung , angiomyolipomas kidney ( ) , tuber brain hamartoma eye . Also , minor feature TSC might diagnostic found major feature person . TSC also diagnose genetic testing described . Major advancement treatment require clinical study test effectiveness experimental drug , surgery , intervention people TSC . Because TSC community vital need new treatment , individual TSC frequently volunteer participate cutting-edge clinical study . Some ongoing clinical study TSC include test effect drug treatment neurocognitive function , test new combination drug treatment LAM , find biomarkers identify infant high risk develop autism infantile spasm , test topical drug treatment facial angiofibromas . Thanks volunteer study , every new day bring u one step closer find improved treatment TSC . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
