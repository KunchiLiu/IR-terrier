	<brief_summary>While proven therapy slow CKD progression , therapy time harmful costly . The ability accurately predict risk CKD progression ESRD would extremely valuable . The short term versus lifetime risk CKD progression take account make risk base clinical decision . In representative CKD practice , investigator compare short term lifetime risk assessment stage 3 CKD patient determine whether decision base short term risk assessment would underestimate lifetime risk CKD progression . The investigator also apply short term risk assessment stage 4 CKD patient determine frequency ESRD risk may overestimate CKD stage 4 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Chronic Kidney Disease Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In US , 20 million adult Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) therefore increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) progression end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) compare without CKD . While many substantiated therapy slow progression CKD improve overall outcome , clinical decision make difficult due variability progression CKD increase risk cardiovascular mortality . As therapy time harmful costly , ability accurately predict risk CKD progression would extremely valuable . Kidney Disease : Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) recently incorporate risk scale reflection composite 5 CKD outcome : all-cause mortality , CVD mortality , ESRD , acute kidney injury ( AKI ) progression CKD . It infancy guideline reflect risk stratification yet determine . Several risk prediction tool validate specific CKD population none widely accept implemented clinical setting . These tool incorporate multiple risk factor compare KDIGO risk category use eGFR urine albumin creatinine ratio ( ACR ) determine risk mention composite . The KDIGO scale take age account may major effect risk stratification . One risk assessment tool take patient ' age account risk equation develop paper Tangri N et al . ( JAMA 2011 ; 305 ( 15 ) :1553-1559 ) . This equation use age , sex , serum calcium level , serum phosphate level , serum albumin level serum bicarbonate level addition GFR UCR calculate risk progression ESRD require dialysis transplantation . This risk calculator reflect short term risk supply 2yr 5yr progression risk CKD stage 3 4 patient . A Lifetime risk estimator ( adjust compete risk death ) use age , sex eGFR define age sex specific 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 lifetime risk CKD progression provide study Turin TC et al ( J Am Soc Nephrol 2012 ; 23 ( 9 ) :1569-1578 ) . The purpose study examine effect use 2yr , 5yr lifetime risk assessment tool population individual stage 3 4 CKD .</detailed_description>
