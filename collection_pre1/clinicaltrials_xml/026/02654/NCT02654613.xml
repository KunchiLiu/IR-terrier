	<brief_summary>This study address high rank health research priority South Africa , , develop test optimal model HIV-TB service delivery enhance retention , adherence coverage HIV-TB co-infected patient . HIV TB high sub-Saharan Africa , region limit health budget , infrastructure , human resource , suboptimal TB infection control practice . There compel clinical evidence suggest integrate HIV TB service save life present effective efficient use resource direct optimize health outcome . Quality improvement ( QI ) method increasingly use systematically test incorporate local idea strategy reliable implementation scale . This trial design test practical , implementable affordable strategy aim improve HIV-TB service integration reduce TB HIV associate death . This cluster randomize controlled trial , evaluate test effectiveness implement QI model integrate HIV-TB service delivery primary health care clinic , reduce morbidity mortality TB-HIV co-infected patient . This study conduct 2 district , Ugu uThungulu , KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa . The model integrate care delivery TB HIV use QI method offer system approach care delivery directly enhance treatment outcome enable comprehensive effective care design around patient journey entry clinic , screen treatment initiation , treatment completion , retention care direct goal cure TB , effective sustainable HIV viral suppression reduce HIV associate TB mortality main health impact . The scalability model , proven effective , critical element make increase population coverage quality diagnosis treatment HIV-TB co-infection . QI method promote front line staff engagement identification rapid test local implementation solution gap performance process care along step patient journey . Gaps care identify continuous feedback core set indicator collect monthly routine collection data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim study test effectiveness peer mentor-led , quality-improvement model service delivery integrate HIV-TB treatment mortality HIV-TB co-infected patient treated rural primary health care clinic KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa Specific Objectives ( ) To determine impact QI-mediated HIV-TB service integration patient mortality . All patient access service intervention control clinic , via either TB entry point via HIV entry point track clinic follow-up visit , community care giver , vital status ascertain 12 month clinic randomization . ( ii ) To determine effectiveness peer-led Quality Improvement ( QI ) integrate HIV-TB service . The effect , HIV-TB integrate process care , deployment QI approach ( system view , data drive decision making , culture continuous improvement , train peer mentor ) ensure uniform implementation essential package evidence base HIV-TB intervention support HIV-TB integration . The impact clinical outcome use QI method implement integrate HIV TB management assess use follow indicator : Time ART initiation among HIV infect TB suspect case ; HIV test rate TB patient ; Number HIV-TB co-infected patient receive co-treatment TB HIV facility ; Number patient infect HIV TB retain care 12 month ; Indicators treatment adherence - number HIV patient virologically suppress 12 month TB treatment outcome ; Hospitalisation rate among patient receive co-treatment TB HIV . ( iii ) To identify clinic-level factor impact integrate HIV-TB service . Understanding context ( environmental , social political factor ) work essential identifying factor promote inhibit implementation intervention . We use COACH tool ( Context Assessment Community Health ) [ 8 ] collect data assess organizational context influence factor organizational culture , leadership , resource HCWs remuneration etc . intervention ( iv ) To determine cost-effectiveness implement HIV-TB service use Quality Improvement methodology ( Intervention Clinics ) versus base-case implement HIV-TB service independently , within-trial approach use health service ( e.g . training , remuneration ) patient cost ( e.g . travel , opportunity cost ) input . We also calculate total intervention cost assess affordability explore cost-effectiveness various scenario ( e.g . different TB-HIV co-infection rate ) use decision analytical modeling . ( v ) To identify set intervention , change idea , tool approach use scale adoption , implementation sustainability integrate HIV-TB service across South Africa resource constrain setting . ( vi ) To strengthen capacity CAPRISA independently perform implementation research PRDs , include community-randomized trial health economic analysis , expert mentor supervision PhD programme .</detailed_description>
