	<brief_title>Study With T-cel Receptor Gene Therapy Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In multicenter phase I/IIa trial 25 patient treat non-myeloablative chemotherapy follow adoptive transfer autologous TCR transduce T cell , study feasibility , safety efficacy treatment . Patients receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide ( 60 30 mg/kg/day x 2 day i.v . ) fludarabine ( 25 mg/m2/day i.v . x 5 day ) . Following regimen , patient receive one single intravenous adoptive transfer transduce T cell start first dose level . - Dose level 1 : 5x10^7 transduce T cell , cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day - Dose level 1a : 1,0x10^8 transduce T cell , cyclophosphamide 30 mg/kg/day - Dose level 2 : 2,5x10^8 transduce T cell , cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day - Dose level 3 : maximum 1x10^9 transduce T cell ( depend production yield ) . At time point 4 , 8 , 12 week every 3 month thereafter patient evaluate response treatment . After 3 patient treat dose level , 8 week last patient infuse transduced T cell , DSMB inform observed toxicity efficacy within cohort decide , base information , whether trial continue next dose level continue current dose level . The study continue first stage ( 2-stage Simon ) , total 16 patient enrol treat : less 2 response observe , trial stop conclusion TCR lack efficacy . Otherwise , trial continue second stage . In addition , safety data first 16 patient evaluated DSMB . Any unexpected serious ( grade 3/4 high ) toxicity trial , report immediately DSMB CCMO . Second stage : overall 25 patient enrol ( include first stage ) : total number response two stage combine less 5 , trial stop soon evident conclusion TCR lack efficacy .</detailed_description>
