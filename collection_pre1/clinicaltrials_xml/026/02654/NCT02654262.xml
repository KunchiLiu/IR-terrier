	<detailed_description>The pediatric obesity epidemic continue unabated . Its cardio-metabolic complication undisputed , include inflammation , insulin resistance ( IR ) , glucose intolerance great prevalence type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) youth . We contend equally serious consequence obesity co-morbidities detrimental effect bone development adolescence , critical time mineral accrual architectural modeling underlies bone strength fracture risk . This proposition receive little attention sparse result mixed , report augment impaired mineralization . In contrast , animal data demonstrates reduce mineral accrual compromise architecture insulin resistance chronic inflammation . The conflicting result youth likely due mixed sample analyse commingle obese youth metabolic complication call metabolically healthy obese youth use technology ( i.e. , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , DXA ) measure bone outcomes confound change investigator seek detect . We posit positive mechanical effect excess adiposity bone counter chronic low-grade inflammation IR obese youth metabolic complication suffer impaired bone development whereas obesity otherwise metabolically healthy youth augments development . A thorough understanding effect adiposity co-morbidities bone development crucial development efficacious intervention aim maximal mineral accrual bone modeling . Thus , propose primary aim design clarify effect obesity , insulin resistance inflammation bone around time peak height velocity . Adipose tissue ( AT ) distribution undoubtedly matter , especially abdominal visceral AT skeletal muscle fat content , strongly related insulin resistance . Failure characterize fat distribution another important limitation past study . Consequently assess effect visceral AT skeletal muscle fat along whole body fatness propose secondary aim design develop safe , cost effective method others use estimate AT distribution , critical component risk rarely study youth relative bone development . Primary Aims : 1 . Assess association total regional adiposity ( visceral AT leg muscle fat content ) , insulin resistance , inflammation bone mass , density , structure strength normal weight , overweight , obese pre-menarcheal girl 2 . Assess effect total regional adiposity , insulin resistance , inflammation bone development ( i.e. , 2 year change bone parameter ) normal weight obese pre-menarcheal girl .</detailed_description>
