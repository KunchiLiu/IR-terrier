	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel , trastuzumab work give surgery treat patient stage I-II human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER2/neu ) positive breast cancer ( confine breast breast lymph node arm ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel trastuzumab surgery may help prevent cancer come back .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide , Paclitaxel , Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Stage I-II HER2/Neu Positive Breast Cancer After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity ability complete plan treatment dose-dense regimen cyclophosphamide paclitaxel trastuzumab subject newly diagnose stage I-II HER2/neu positive breast cancer . II . To estimate recurrence free survival dose-dense regimen cyclophosphamide paclitaxel trastuzumab subject newly diagnose stage I-II HER2/neu positive breast cancer . OUTLINE : SYSTEMIC THERAPY : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour , paclitaxel IV 3 hour , trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE TRASTUZUMAB THERAPY : Beginning course 6 , patient receive trastuzumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 52 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may undergo radiation therapy discretion radiation oncologist medical oncologist patient estrogen/progesterone receptor positive tumor receive hormonal therapy determine medical oncologist per standard National Comprehensive Care Network ( NCCN ) guideline . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
