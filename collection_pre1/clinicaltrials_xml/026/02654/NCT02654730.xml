	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Primaquine Combination With Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine G6PD Deficient Males The Gambia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In current study investigator aim assess safety PQ , particular risk acute haemolysis , give together dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHAP ) G6PD deficient individual . Forty male participant haemoglobin level ( ≥11g/dL ) , reduce G6PD enzyme function , age ≥10years sequentially enrol two dose cohort consist 20 individual dose 0.25 0.4 mg/kg PQ combination full three-day course DHAP . Participants first assign low open cohort ; enrolment next cohort initiate tolerability short-term safety demonstrate precede low dose . Furthermore , investigator include 3 control group first cohort : ) 10 male participant age ≥10years normal haemoglobin level ( ≥11g/dL ) reduce G6PD enzyme function receive DHAP , ii ) 10 male participant normal haemoglobin level ( ≥11g/dL ) normal G6PD enzyme function receive 0.25 mg/kg PQ combination full three-day course DHAP , iii ) 10 male participant normal haemoglobin level ( ≥11g/dL ) normal G6PD enzyme function receive 0.4 mg/kg PQ DHAP . Enrolment group assignment Individuals agree participate screen meet inclusion criterion , invite enrolment . During , participant and/or carers inform objective practical consequence participation current study ask sign inform consent form . The possibility withdrawal study , time without declaration reason point . After enrolment , participant assign lowest-dose open cohort , enrolment second cohort initiate tolerability short-term safety demonstrate precede low dose ( enrolment second cohort account G6PD deficient participant ) . Within cohort , first 2 participant intervention group treat monitor 6 day immediate side-effects haematological abnormality rest participant particular intervention group enrol treat . Once safety first 2 participant confirm , next 4 subject enrol treatment next 4 subject initiate day 2 last treated participant precede 4 subject . The last two group intervention group comprise 5 individual , make total 20 . After inclusion intervention group first cohort ( n=20 ) complete ( follow-up day 14 last participant group ) , 10-day safety observation period instal enrolment intervention group second cohort initiate . Interventions evaluation Clinical follow-up participant sample do twice daily first 4 day ( day 0 , 1 , 2 3 ) daily day 4 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 14 28 . At time-point participant examine clinically ( except day 28 ) structure questionnaire use determine occurrence side effect . Furthermore , laboratory safety parameter measure , include haematology , biochemistry , urine dipstick haemoglobinuria/urobilinogen . Five individual intervention group ( total 10 ) also ask provide seven venous blood sample ( less 1 ml ) day 0 , 1 2 study pharmacokinetics PQ G6PD deficient individual</detailed_description>
