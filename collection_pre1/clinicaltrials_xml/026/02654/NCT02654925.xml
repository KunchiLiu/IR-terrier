	<brief_summary>In order design new program help prevent weight gain , promote successful sustainable weight loss , help treat disease related obesity , investigator need good understand accumulate fat certain region body bad health . It known fat cell , recently discover fat cell may arise stem cell come bone marrow ( bone marrow progenitor ) , previously unrecognized origin . This discovery paradigm shifting , dogma long hold white fat cell arise fat tissue resident mesenchymal stem cell . This also important fat cell arise bone marrow lineage may link bad health outcome . The aim study determine cell previously believe contribute fat generation human indeed capable become fat cell . To answer question investigator take sample cell blood fat tissue young old men woman , isolate cell come bone marrow grow culture determine turn fat cell . The result investigation may reveal potential mechanistic target future therapy reduce negative health outcome associate obesity relate chronic disease .</brief_summary>
