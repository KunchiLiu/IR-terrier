	<detailed_description>Acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation major cause morbidity mortality . A significant proportion affect patient Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) . Mechanical ventilation often required provide adequate gas exchange although life-saving setting , also know contribute morbidity mortality condition . Ventilators deliver high pressure volume cause regional distension injure lung result inflammation non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema . The release inflammatory mediator damage lung cause systemic inflammation lead multi-organ failure death . The intervention show reduce high mortality patient target ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI ) . A landmark trial ARDSNet trial group find ventilate patient acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure secondary ARDS lung protective strategy aim reduce tidal volume 6ml/kg predict body weight ( PBW ) maximum end-inspiratory plateau pressure ( Pplat ) ≤ 30cmH2O decreased mortality 40 % ( conventional arm treat tidal volume le 12ml/kg PBW ) 31 % . Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal ( ECCO2R ) association mechanical ventilation offer potentially attractive solution permit tidal volume reduction le 6ml/kg PBW achieve low plateau pressure ( &lt; 25cmH2O ) . Using extracorporeal circuit , carbon dioxide 'dialysed ' blood lung ventilate protective manner . In recent year , efficient veno-venous device become available . These replace arterio-venous device advantage require arterial puncture . These achieve carbon dioxide removal relatively low extracorporeal blood flow ( 0.4−1 l/min ) require small dual lumen venous catheter . In addition ECCO2R device use biocompatible material make device resistant clot formation cause less platelet clotting factor consumption . Therefore minimal systemic anticoagulation require reduces likelihood bleed complication . These device comparable renal dialysis equipment , routinely use safely standard care ICUs United Kingdom . Together highlight need large randomise control trial establish whether VV-ECCO2R acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure allow use protective ventilatory strategy associate improved patient outcome . Importantly , benefit , trial would provide evidence stop widespread adoption expensive ineffective potentially harmful treatment setting .</detailed_description>
