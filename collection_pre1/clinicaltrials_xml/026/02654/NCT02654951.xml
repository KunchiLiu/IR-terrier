	<brief_title>Reaching Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : For stroke survivor , use compensatory movement lead reduction range motion , pain , pattern `` learn non-use '' . A common compensatory movement present upper limb reach trunk displacement . Although motion identify important one reduce , strategy address problem consider . The exist strategy require physical restraint person back chair , make undesirable use unsupervised therapy . As result , current need alternate method promote use correct movement pattern clinic home . In sense , technology act enabler create new way reduce trunk compensation . Still , gap literature trunk compensation investigate secondary theme robotic computer-aided rehabilitation . Consequently , project investigator look reduction trunk compensation use robotic device commercially available technology , enable focus quality movement unsupervised therapy . The potential result project could later apply generalize mode compensation stroke neurological disabled population . Objective : Our objective demonstrate feedback cue could use reduce trunk compensatory movement unsupervised therapy . Research Question : Will use force cue attain similar result compare visual feedback reduce trunk compensation ? Equipment : - 1 Kinect ( Microsoft , Inc. ) markerless motion capture system . - 2 Kinova Jaco assistive robotic arm . These device use assist disabled people daily task . The arm design safe interaction ( low force ) user . - 1 Desktop computer monitor deliver visual feedback . Method : The investigator design force feedback cue use two Kinova Jaco robotic device deliver . The investigator investigate force cue could achieve similar good result compare visual feedback ( use computer monitor deliver feedback ) reduce compensatory movement . Even though robotic device capable exert force cue , device difficult implement home setting due complexity price . Consequently , project investigator study use commercially available technology deliver feedback user ' compensatory movement . The investigator compare use force visual feedback study effect reduce compensatory level . The investigator choose use visual feedback deliver system readily available home ( e.g . television set personal computer ) without need purchase complex robotic device . If result project support use commercially available technology , provide evidence potential use technology substitute complement robotic device user continue therapy program home . The force feedback cue provide resistance move robot ' handle . These cue apply user move outside certain error band , base `` normal '' reach pattern . In addition , magnitude cue proportional magnitude trunk compensation . In project two condition compare : visual feedback force feedback . The visual condition use monitor display two cursor ( empty circle ) represent participant 's hand , circle fill red ink user start compensate . As magnitude compensation increase , amount red ink gradually increase indicate level user compensate . Summary Procedures : ( Total Time : 2-2.5 hour ) : 1 . Participants recruit . 2 . Introduce study equipment . Participants ask inform investigator feel uncomfortable fatigue point experiment , give many break need . 3 . Ask participant fill consent form , unable provide consent due health condition , caregivers/guardians provide consent subject provide assent . 4 . Participant fill background questionnaire register physical therapist conduct clinical assessment base recognize impairment scale ( Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment Reaching Performance Scale ) use score baseline comparison perform statistical analysis end phase . The Reaching performance Scale require use video record assessment scoring . If participant want know clinical assessment result , end session , therapist provide photocopy result , give participant explanation result answer question participant may scale . In case Reaching Performance Scale score do study , participant could receive score later date via telephone call . 5 . All study session conduct University British Columbia ( UBC ) Point Grey Campus . During test , participant ask interact computer use follow input technology : 2 Jaco Kinova robotic arm Microsoft Kinect . Using technology , participant perform bimanual symmetric movement arms/hands control simple cursor/target videogame . The Kinect measure participant 's movement data point every joint , video record . The robotic device use record hand ' movement increase resistance move base level trunk compensation participant . The monitor use provide visual feedback participant 's trunk compensation display target game . 6 . Ask participant sit chair adjust footrest foot fully support , knees 90 degree angle , back chair . 7 . Ask participant hold handle two robotic device . 8 . In case participant able hold handle due hand weakness , adjustable fabric elastic strap fit around palm hold hand top handle . 9 . The maximum force user produce push robot measure read robot 's sensor . 10 . Ask participant perform series unimanual reach calibrate system base participant 's arm 's length . 11 . Ask participant perform 5 practice bimanual reach become familiar system motion mapping . 12 . Ask participant perform 15 baseline ( feedback ) bimanual reach measure trunk compensation . The investigator use value average trunk compensation set error band visual force feedback . 13 . Ask participant perform 5 practice bimanual reach become familiar either visual force feedback ( depend randomization subject ) . 14 . Ask participant perform 60 trial bimanual reach 1 target knee height arm fully extend . Participants receive feedback compensation computer 's monitor increase resistance move robot . 15 . The participant able rest target request . In addition 1 minute rest every 15 target . 16 . The participant perform 15 reach without feedback ( Post measurement ) 17 . The participant 5 minute break start second feedback condition . 18 . Repeat step 14 , 15 16 , type feedback ( visual force ) . 19 . A note taker record occurrence obstacle encounter participant study . 20 . The motion track data assessment video save computer file , back UBC-based file server optical medium . 21 . At end session participant answer usability questionnaire . 22 . The data note taker , motion log , assessment video questionnaire use conduct quantitative qualitative analysis gain insight augment feedback reduce compensatory trunk movement , ease use functionality system . All data identify use participant ' number . 23 . The video recording erased/destroyed 5 year publication result . Study Design : The investigator follow within-subjects crossover design independent variable feedback type level : force feedback visual feedback . The primary dependent variable measure trunk compensation . The investigator follow counterbalance strategy reduce carryover effect perform two condition certain order . Data collection include motion log file , score game , discussion participant exit survey .</detailed_description>
