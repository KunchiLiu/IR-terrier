	<brief_title>Study OSE2101 Versus Standard Treatment 2nd 3rd Line HLA-A2 Positive Patients With Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study demonstrate OSE2101 ( Arm A ) superior standard chemotherapy , pemetrexed docetaxel ( Arm B ) , prolong overall survival ( OS ) HLA-A2 positive patient locally advance ( IIIB ) metastatic NSCLC 2nd line therapy failure prior platinum-based chemotherapy 3rd line failure platinum- checkpoint-inhibitor regimen . In Arm B , patient squamous NSCLC allocate docetaxel patient non-squamous NSCLC allocate pemetrexed pemetrexed-naive docetaxel already receive pemetrexed . Treatment cycle repeat unequivocal Recist 1.1-defined disease progression determine investigator , unacceptable toxicity , consent withdrawal .</detailed_description>
