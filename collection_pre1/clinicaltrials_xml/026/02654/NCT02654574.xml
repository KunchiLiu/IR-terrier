	<brief_summary>In France , 1 million people 65 old diagnose dementia syndrome characterize cognitive decline impairment functional capacity . The assessment level functional autonomy therefore essential step monitoring patient Memory Clinic estimate Lawton IADL questionnaire , assess patient ' ability perform daily task . In Memory Clinic , first estimate level patient autonomy achieve face-to-face interview primary caregiver nurse , use IADL questionnaire . This assessment renew every year . The IADL questionnaire part information memory consultations shall transmit Alzheimer 's National Bank ( BNA ) . However , current practice show systematic collection problematic organization Memory Clinic . It thus expect collect questionnaire phone order measure change level autonomy disease , improve completeness collection . A study conduct main objective measure reliability assessment IADL questionnaires conduct telephone interview caregiver patient , comparison reference mode : face-to-face interview caregiver . Materials methods The experimental design study randomize crossover trial ( crossover ) , include 394 patient divide two branch . In first part , collection IADL questionnaire perform accord reference method consultation ( face-to-face interview nurse ) , measurement repeat 1 month interval phone . In second part sequence execution mode reverse . The reliability measurement level autonomy study compare repeat measurement base handover mode . The correspondence repeat measure also consider term patient characteristic . The feasibility administration questionnaire phone mode evaluate . Expected result The mode administration phone allow obtain reliable measurement level patient autonomy administration carry standardized way . The study also identify patient situation method administration phone may appropriate .</brief_summary>
