	<brief_summary>To follow longitudinally healthy immune-compromised response pneumococcal vaccination , 60+ individual towards development personalize medicine implementation ( minimum enrollment 2 age category : young adult [ 18-25 ] , old adult [ 55+ ] , within category : 10+ healthy , 10+ asthma , 10+ immune-compromised [ e.g . leukemia autoimmune disorder ] ) . The approach profile thousand molecular component utilize high-throughput technology integrate data obtain personalized immune response vaccination . The study provide insight immune response mechanism specific asthmatic , immune compromise healthy individual , well response vaccination . Additionally differences dynamic response across two age group investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary investigation involve integrative multi-omics monitor individual follow pneumonia vaccination twelve time point . Genomic sequence use evaluate volunteer 's genomic risk base variant know disease association . Full transcriptome ( via RNA-Sequencing ) , proteome metabolome profiling ( via mass spectrometry ) perform per time-point . This allow dynamic monitoring thousand molecular component responses vaccination , capture initial innate response reaction addition adaptive response return baseline . This study involve simple blood draw , saliva collection , standard FDA-approved pneumococcal vaccine administration Spirometry .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants age 18 25 year old , 55 old , diagnose asthma , immunecompromising condition ( e.g . Leukemia treat , Pulmonary disorder ) healthy . Subjects may participate study follow applies : The potential subject already vaccinate PPSV23 . Subjects special risk attendant venipuncture . Existence medical condition study investigator believe interfere study participation evaluation result . This include subject immunosuppressive medication and/or glucocorticoid . Mental incapacity and/or cognitive impairment would preclude adequate understanding , cooperation , study protocol . For female participant : subject exclude pregnant . There known risk pregnant woman PPSV23 vaccine ( also indicate Vaccine Information Statement ( VIS ) attachment provide participant ) , additional risk associate become pregnant study . However , pregnancy affect immune system response , may affect molecular readout study introduce confound factor analysis investigator . If participant already enrol becomes pregnant study , investigator temporarily withdraw study day participants become pregnant . If participant would like stay study , investigator may continue participation delivery . If participant severe allergy ( lifethreatening ) participant ever lifethreatening allergic reaction dose pneumococcal vaccine , know severe allergy part vaccine , participant advise participate . If participant feeling well schedule day vaccination , study coordinator suggest wait participant feel well . If participant agrees , vaccination reschedule later date .</criteria>
