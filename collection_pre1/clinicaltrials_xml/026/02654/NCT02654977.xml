	<brief_title>CLINICAL PROTOCOL Investigate Long-term Safety Efficacy Metreleptin Various Forms Partial Lipodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leptin approve therapeutic form Myalept patient generalize form lipodystrophy . However , still investigation patient partial form disease base FDA decision February 24 , 2014 . The study investigator carry protocol patient partial lipodystrophy , specifically familial partial lipodystrophy . There number patient treat protocol cover currently approve label , experience significant clinical benefit . This study would allow continued treatment patient partial form lipodystrophy volunteer complete treatment investigator ' ongoing protocol ( MB002-014 ) derive significant clinical benefit judge amelioration HbA1c , triglyceride level , and/or reduction baseline diabetes lipid therapy affect quality life .</detailed_description>
