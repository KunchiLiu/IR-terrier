	<brief_title>Sodium Butyrate For Improving Cognitive Function In Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose grant evaluate efficacy sodium butyrate novel treatment cognitive deficit schizophrenia ( SZ ) . Sodium butyrate short chain fatty acid bind zinc site histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) . The inhibition HDAC result histone hyperacetylation . The proposal consist small preliminary open label study assess tolerability side effect sodium butyrate schizophrenic patient receive antipsychotic treatment ( 5 patient SZ treat sodium butyrate 8 week ) , follow large double-blind study effect sodium butyrate cognitive function symptom , SZ patient acute exacerbation primary symptom show continued cognitive deficit . Secondary aim evaluate effect improve symptom function SZ , relationship drug 's clinical effect epigenetic inflammation relate biochemical change . In double-blind phase plan study 3 site : 2 US , 1 China , US site Nathan Kline Institute ( NKI ) active initial phase study . We provide brief overview importance question , previous interventional treatment approach , potential HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate particular improve cognitive function . The persistent cognitive deficit appreciate across course SZ , prodromal chronic SZ , may important underlie dysfunction prevent functional , occupational , social recovery SZ compare symptom domain . There effective treatment cognitive deficit persist antipsychotic medication reduce resolve positive symptom SZ . Although exploratory study nicotinic agonist drug show promise improvement cognitive deficit associate SZ , later large better-controlled study nicotinic agonist drug show markedly positive effect type pharmacologic intervention , although one recent study promising . There increase interest epigenetic mechanism involve DNA methylation histone acetylation involve pathology underlie SZ related disorder ) . There also interest activation inflammatory process part underlie pathophysiology SZ , research show effect inflammatory marker may partially mediate though epigenetic mechanism histone acetylation DNA methylation . There grow evidence HDAC inhibitor drug ( HDACi ) property cognitive enhancer potential treatment psychiatric disorder cognitive deficit prominent , SZ Alzheimer 's disease . Graff Tsai suggest may particularly important process promote memory consolidation conversion short-term longer- term memory increase memory retention consolidation . Memory consolidation demonstrate temporal gradient retrograde amnesia ( severity amnesia severe event occur shortly amnesic event ) , well improvement delay recall previously learn information retention interval . A specific deficit memory consolidation demonstrate SZ . Delayed recall performance may use index consolidation . For example , Goff et al find evidence beneficial effect d-cycloserine delayed immediate thematic recall use Logical Memory Test ( LMT ) Revised Wechsler Memory Scale ( WMS-R ) . Sodium butyrate chemical compound find food sell health food supplemental ( nutraceutical ) strong HDAC inhibitor ( predominantly class I HDAC ) anti-inflammatory neuroprotective property ) . Previous study suggest may potential treatment cognitive deficit several psychiatric disorder , potential ameliorative effect depression , human inflammatory disease . Research animal model show sodium butyrate phenylbutyrate potential improve cognition , include rescue fear spatial memory enhancement contextual memory , spatial memory object recognition improve memory mouse model Alzheimer 's disease . Sodium butyrate also decrease depressive-like behavior model maternal deprivation chronic stress . One human study butyrate congener improve cognitive outcome , include improvement test work memory , treatment urea cycle hyperammonia disorder . Sodium butyrate also use clinical trial inflammatory bowel disease ( Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) positive effect clinical state also improvement indicator inflammation . In Crohn 's disease study also significantly decreased immunological component interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 β ) . It use sell widely health food supplement nutraceutical human good safety profile . It also reduce insulin resistance lipid metabolic abnormality document animal model fat induced insulin resistance experimental human study prevent lipid induced insulin resistance . This effect may relevant beneficial effect metabolic abnormality frequently report obese SZ . Sodium butyrate lipophilic compound pass blood-brain barrier . This report previous study review state sodium butyrate cross blood brain barrier ) . For example , mouse model oral sodium butyrate increase histone acetylation brain periphery . This fulfill criterion Stanley grant organization request report proposed pharmacological study . The background provide rationale trial sodium butyrate cognitive enhancer SZ . The specific aim double-blind test follow hypothesis . Primary Aim : 1 . Treatment sodium butyrate improve cognition SZ measure composite domain score Measurement Treatment Research Improve Cognition Schizophrenia battery ( MATRICS [ MCCB ] ) . The primary outcome measure MCCB composite score . Secondary Aims : 2 . Treatment sodium butyrate improve memory consolidation measure delayed recall performance . 3 . Improvement cognitive function induce sodium butyrate SZ correlate improvement measure performance real world functional task assess University California San Diego ( USCD ) Performance- Based Skills Assessment Battery ( UPSA ) . We also explore whether improvement cognition relate change HDAC activity peripheral blood cell change inflammatory maker blood ( CRP , IL-1 β ) , assess whether improvement psychopathology measure PANSS scale . The study conduct two phase , open-label study safety tolerability sodium butyrate patient schizophrenia follow randomized placebo control experimental study effect adjunctive 6.57 gms sodium butyrate per day 12 week</detailed_description>
