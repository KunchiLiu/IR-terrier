	<brief_summary>Low back pain ( LBP ) cause 2.4 % visit US emergency department ( ED ) result 2.7 million visit annually . In general , outcomes patient poor . One week ED discharge , 70 % patient report persistent back-pain related functional impairment 69 % report analgesic use within previous 24 hour . Three month ED visit , 48 % patient report functional impairment , 42 % report moderate severe pain , 46 % report persistent analgesic use . It clear acute LBP treat . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) guideline-supported , first line therapy acute LBP . NSAIDs efficacious placebo regard pain relief , global improvement , requirement analgesic medication sufficient therapy many Â½ ED patient , continue suffer despite therapy NSAIDs . Treatment LBP multiple concurrent medication common ED -- emergency physician often prescribe benzodiazepine , skeletal muscle relaxant , opioids combination NSAIDs . However , work recently complete Montefiore reveal combine skeletal muscle relaxant opioids NSAIDs improve outcomes . It remain uncertain add benzodiazepine NSAIDs improve LBP outcomes . Although benzodiazepine use 300,000 US ED visit LBP annually , scant evidence exists determine appropriateness approach . Efficacy benzodiazepine may relate direct centrally-mediated action skeletal muscle may instead work mitigate anxiety condition numb patient pain . Given poor pain functional outcome persist beyond ED visit musculoskeletal LBP , propose clinical trial evaluate whether combine benzodiazepine NSAID effective NSAID monotherapy treatment acute , non-traumatic , non-radicular low back pain . Specifically , evaluate follow hypothesis : A daily regimen naproxen + diazepam provide great relief LBP naproxen + placebo one week ED visit , measure Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire .</brief_summary>
