	<brief_summary>This multi-centre open label study involve minimum 120 patient 2 cohort : 60 patient 'early UC ' defined disease duration &lt; 4 year treatment aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroid 60 patient 'late UC ' define active disease despite treatment immunosuppressive ( IS ) and/or anti-TNF . Patients wih intolerance IS AND anti-TNF also allow latter group . Participants treat 12 month open label vedolizumab undergo monitoring endoscopic , histological clinical disease parameter . No randomization blind perform study management make sure recruitment either study group comparable number profile patient ( extent disease on/off corticosteroid ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Phase 4 Study Evaluate Efficacy Early Versus Late Use Vedolizumab Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory disease colon . Symptoms include bloody diarrhea , weight loss , fever . There know cause cure UC . The aim current UC treatment induce maintain remission , reduce need corticosteroid avoid colectomy . Treatment option include 5-Aminosalicylates ( 5-ASA ) , systemic and/or topical corticosteroid , purine analogue ( 6-mercaptopurine azathioprine ) , anti-TNF antibody surgery . In 2013 , result GEMINI I , phase 3 , randomize control trial demonstrate efficacy vedolizumab ( VDZ ) induce maintain remission adult patient active UC . VDZ ( MLN0002 MLN02 ) , inhibit interaction α4β7 integrin memory T B cell mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 express vascular endothelium gut show effective inducing maintain clinical remission UC . With ( anti-TNF ) biologics , outcome usually better treatment start earlier disease course patient expose prior antibody treatment . Therefore , appear appropriate desirable test potency vedolizumab earlier phase UC . Indeed , also vedolizumab patient previously expose biologics appear low success rate vedolizumab , position earlier disease course would likely lead good outcome . This investigator-initiated open label study VDZ therapy 2 distinct population UC patient active disease : 1. patient diagnose &lt; 4 year ago expose aminosalicylates corticosteroid 2. patient exposed immunomodulators and/or anti-TNF agent addition steroid aminosalicylates . VDZ show efficacious induce maintain remission UC . However , data endoscopic histological effect VDZ 'early UC ' lacking . Therefore , investigator propose perform interventional study early late UC patient include endoscopic histological assessment</detailed_description>
