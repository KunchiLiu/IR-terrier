	<brief_summary>Investigators design novel combining technique rescuer start chest compression one hand call help Emergency Medical System ( EMS ) via cell phone another hand witness arrest victim . This method may helpful reduce hand-off time increase faction time chest compression arrival EMS member . To verify hypothesis , conduct random , control simulation study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combining Performance Call EMS Simultaneous Chest Compressions Lone Rescuer CPR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use random , control design simulation set use manikin . Study participant recruit healthy adult ( age &gt; 18 year ) layperson attend BLS training course provide BLS train class . The simulation scenario consist witness hospital cardiac arrest activation EMS system prepare cellular phone . Interventional method contain immediate start chest compression one hand call help EMS via cell phone another hand . We compare quality CPR novel interventional method ( start CPR Call EMS ) conventional method ( First Call EMS start CPR ) .</detailed_description>
