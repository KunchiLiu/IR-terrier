	<brief_title>Treatment Young Adults With Comorbid AUD/MDD : A Pilot Medication Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MDD AUD highly prevalent among young adult , comorbidity two disorder occurs often would expect chance alone . The presence comorbidity associate increase risk motor vehicle accident , relapse alcohol use , suicide , recurrence depressive illness , increased morbidity , costly hospitalization . Thus , comorbidity AUD/MDD highly significant public health problem among young adult , considerable unmet treatment need . Previous medication trial SSRI antidepressant involve co-occurring condition , include recent trial SSRI medication , produce disappointing result , especially decrease level alcohol consumption .

However , pilot study include placebo control group , efficacy mirtazapine decrease level alcohol use among person comorbid AUD/MDD remain unclear . To date , double-blind , placebo-controlled study even conduct ass whether mirtazapine decrease level drink depressive symptom young adult comorbid AD/MDD .
