	<brief_title>Reliability Study Using Electrodermal Activity Measure Sensory Processing Children With Without Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This methodological research design prospective exploratory test-retest design assess use electrodermal activity ( EDA ) index sensory processing . EDA measure use skin conductance response ( SCR ) . The purpose study investigate use EDA reliable measure time within context response sensation . Scores test one test two subject correlate determine reliability EDA measure . Reliability context establish utility EDA index sensory processing . Testing occur two time within six week period .</detailed_description>
