	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) increasingly recognize significant public health issue , effective rehabilitation method yet identify . The Institute Medicine Agency Healthcare Quality Research sponsor systematic review evidence comparative effectiveness rehabilitation intervention TBI . Both review conclude substantially research need identify intervention best suit different individual . The practice-based evidence ( PBE ) approach employ create data use propose study research method recommend provide great clarity , along use patient-centered outcome obtain long period time use previous study . The follow specific aim address propose study : 1 . Determine comparative effectiveness different therapeutic approach use inpatient TBI rehabilitation statistically adjust patient need ability benefit various approach . Investigators hypothesize : 1.1 . Patients receive great proportion therapy time Advanced Training ( versus Standard Care ) achieve good outcome similar patient receive less proportion treatment time Advanced Training . 1.2 . Patients great initial level disability experience large effect Advanced Training therapeutic approach comparison effect experience patient less disability admission . 1.3 . Patients receive great proportion therapy contextualized treatment ( versus decontextualized ) achieve good outcome similar patient receive less proportion time contextualized treatment . 2 . Determine comparative effectiveness difference delivery inpatient rehabilitation therapy , statistically adjust patient need ability benefit . Investigators hypothesize : 2.1 The level effort patient able apply treatment moderate effectiveness time treatment . 2.2 Family involvement treatment associate well outcome . Data drawn database establish TBI Practice-Based Evidence Study ( TBI-PBE Study ) . Data 2130 person receive inpatient TBI rehabilitation 10 site ( 9 US , 1 Canada ) obtain study . Detailed longitudinal data collect prospectively rehabilitation therapy ( point care data complete every clinical encounter ) , course recovery , person injury characteristic outcomes rehabilitation . Advanced analytic method ( e.g . propensity score , generalize linear mixed model ) use compare effect different rehabilitation intervention outcomes discharge 9 month follow rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
