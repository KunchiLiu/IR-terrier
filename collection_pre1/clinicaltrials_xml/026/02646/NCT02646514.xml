	<brief_summary>Malignant obstructive jaundice common complication advance stage cholangiocarcinoma , gallbladder cancer , pancreatic cancer . In biliary stricture malignancy , biliary drainage placement self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) palliation therapy choice patient . When compare plastic stent , SEMS present significantly decrease risk recurrent biliary obstruction . SEMS also cost-effective plastic stent patient life expectancy longer 4 month . However , despite numerous benefit , SEMS become occluded 50 % patient first 6-8 month . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) use treat malignancy liver since early 1990s . Other study investigate role disease colon esophagus . More recently , technique recognize potential palliative treatment malignant biliary stricture . RFA use high-frequency alternate current generate heat achieve coagulative necrosis contact tissue . Within bile duct , RFA appear safe may result decreased benign epithelial hyperplasia tumor ingrowth . However , RFA along placement SEMS well study . On hand , newly develop RFA catheter ( ELRA® ) show feasibility safety south korea , recently . The purpose study investigate Efficacy safety endobiliary RFA use novel RF catheter ( ELRA® ) maintain patency endobiliary metal drainage patient malignant biliary stricture .</brief_summary>
