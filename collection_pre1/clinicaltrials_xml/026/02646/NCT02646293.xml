	<brief_summary>The incidence diagnosis renal cell carcinoma increase past two decade detection small renal tumour occur incidentally increase use CT-scanning ( 1,2 ) . Postoperative renal insufficiency significant independent predictor overall cardiovascular specific survival ( 3 ) . `` Nephron-sparing '' surgical technique prefer small tumor mass laparoscopic intervention replace open surgery center master technique . This area priority within Regions Zaeland Southern Denmark . The primary endpoint : The early plasma ( 5 day ) [ NT-proBNP ] response predict long-term total renal function function remain kidney . The second endpoint : Plasma [ NT-proBNP ] increase acutely partial nephrectomy change reflect renal mass reduction . Chronic blood pressure change inversely related plasma [ BNP ] .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Irreversible kidney damage describe beyond thirty minute warm ischemia time ( WIT ) , even completely normal system ( 4 ) . Gill et al . ( 5 ) report 18 % kidney function loss thirty-two minute WIT . Preliminary data center show reduction WIT eleven minute ( 6 ) associate reduction renal function loss 11 % . There however , increase need understand pathophysiology associate partial nephrectomy procedure beyond ischemia time need biomarkers predictive value order create evidence-based , mechanistic frame protective intervention . The current proposal seek address issue highly specialized area . Specific background study After unilateral total nephrectomy , contralateral kidney within hour undergoes functional adaptation increase renal blood flow ( RBF ) glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) thereby maintain whole body fluid electrolyte homeostasis . In collaborative project ( Schweda et al . submit ) , show cardiac hormone `` Brain Natriuretic Peptide '' , BNP ( measure prohormone NT-pro-BNP ) , Atrial Natriuretic Peptide ( ANP ) , could play important role adaptation . Plasma [ NT-proBNP ] rapidly increase 6-fold human kidney donor . The figure show single kidney GFR ( leave ) plasma NT-proBNP ( right ) total unilateral nephrectomy ( UNx ) 4 day family kidney donor . In animal experiment , BNP infusion mouse increase GFR RBF target deletion receptor BNP ( GC-A ) abolish effect . BNP relax microdissected intrarenal human artery isolate center . For termination action , BNP depend large degree renal excretion thus data could suggest `` automatic '' , built-in protective mechanism renal function display acute decline . In fact , clinical utility biomarker cardiology ventricular function/load discuss relation dependence renal function excretion . Thus renal dysfunction cause elevate BNP absence leave ventricular dysfunction ( 7 ) It clear 1 ) NT-proBNP change parallel BNP , 2 ) equally dependent renal function clearance ( 8 ) . Degradation peptides occur enzymatically , note , beneficial effect Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4 ) inhibitor kidney function ischemic injury kidney ( 9 ) . Since BNP signal series catalytic receptor guanylyl cyclase activity cyclic guanidine monophosphate ( cGMP ) formation , highly interesting administration phosphodiesterase-5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor sildenafil improve immediate renal function kidney autotransplant pig model warm ischemia-reperfusion pig model ( 10,11 ) . Moreover , mouse deficient receptor ANP BNP ( GC-A ) display hypertension . It therefore likely BNP increase acutely immediate post-nephrectomy phase promote glomerular filtration remain nephron contributes maintain low blood pressure ( 12 ) . There paucity direct examination mechanistic relationship renal function plasma BNP . This possible set acute surgical removal define renal mass . We aim characterize acute longitudinal change BNP ( NT-proBNP ) patient e.g partial nephrectomy `` nephron-sparing '' intervention compare total nephrectomy patient respect correlation GFR prediction long-term renal function . Aim Study The overall aim preserve protect remain kidney function improve long-term renal outcome renal surgical intervention renal mass reduction . Objective The project aim investigate functional response predictive significance Brain Natriuretic Peptide ( NT-proBNP ) renal function blood pressure level renal surgical intervention particular , focus change partial nephrectomy compare total nephrectomy . Specific Hypotheses 1 . The early plasma ( 5 day ) [ NT-proBNP ] response predict long-term total renal function function remain kidney ( primary effect ) 2 . Plasma [ NT-proBNP ] increase acutely partial nephrectomy change reflect renal mass reduction 3 . Chronic blood pressure change inversely related plasma [ BNP ] Design : The study design observational , longitudinal study plasma [ NT-proBNP ] , renal function blood pressure follow patient undergo partial total nephrectomy ( `` nephron spar surgery '' ) relate plasma BNP .</detailed_description>
