	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study well nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin work treat patient cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment ( advanced cancer ) abnormality protein call mechanistic target rapamycin ( mTOR ) . Patients mutation identify genetic testing . Patients receive nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin , may stop growth cancer cell block mTOR enzyme , need cell growth multiplication . Using treatment target patient 's specific mutation may effective treatment standard care treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate efficacy group patient define disease type , genomic aberration treatment regimen . II . To assess confirm response rate nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin ( nab-rapamycin ) mTOR aberrant advance cancer . ( Sub-protocol Arm A ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate clinical outcome ( e.g. , progression-free overall survival ) group patient define disease type , genomic aberration treatment regimen . II . To describe adverse event profile regimen . III . To assess clinical benefit rate nab-rapamycin mTOR aberrant advance cancer . ( Sub-protocol Arm A ) . IV . To estimate progression-free survival ( specifically 6 month ) overall survival patient . ( Sub-protocol Arm A ) V. To estimate adverse event profile nab-rapamycin . ( Sub-protocol Arm A ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe patient health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) symptoms use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Life Questionnaire-Core ( QLQ-C ) 30 group patient define disease type and/or treatment regimen correlative HRQOL/symptoms genomic marker . II . To assess rate individual mTOR pathway aberration ass association individual mTOR pathway aberration clinical outcome across disease indication within disease indication . ( Sub-protocol Arm A ) OUTLINE : Patients receive nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 24 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
