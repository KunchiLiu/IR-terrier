	<brief_summary>This multi-centre open label study involve minimum 260 patient 2 cohort : 130 patient 'early CD ' defined disease duration &lt; 24 month treatment corticosteroid 130 patient 'late CD ' define active disease despite treatment immunosuppressive anti-TNF . Patients intolerance IS anti-TNF also allow latter group . Participants treat 12 month open label vedolizumab ( study medication follow commercial medication reimbursement available ) undergo monitor endoscopic , histological clinical disease parameter . No randomization blind perform study management ensure recruitment either study group comparable number profile patient ( on/off steroid ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy , Early Versus Late Use Vedolizumab Crohn 's Disease : LOVE-CD Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) chronic inflammatory disease small bowel colon . Symptoms commonly include bloody diarrhea , abdominal pain , weight loss , fever . There know cause cure CD . The aim current CD treatment induce maintain remission , reduce need corticosteroid avoid resection fistula . Treatment option include systemic and/or topical corticosteroid , purine analogue ( 6-mercaptopurine azathioprine ) , anti-TNF antibody surgery . In 2013 , result GEMINI II , phase 3 , randomize control trial demonstrate efficacy vedolizumab ( VDZ ) induce maintain remission adult patient active CD . VDZ ( MLN0002 , MLN02 ) , inhibit interaction α4β7 integrin memory T B cell mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 express vascular endothelium gut show effective inducing maintain clinical remission ulcerative colitis . The ideal positioning vedolizumab therapeutic armamentarium CD remain unknown . With ( anti-TNF ) biologics , outcome usually better treatment start earlier disease course patient expose prior antibody treatment . Therefore , appear appropriate desirable test potency vedolizumab earlier phase CD . Indeed , also vedolizumab patient previously expose biologics appear low success rate vedolizumab , position earlier disease course would likely lead good outcome . This investigator-initiated open label study VDZ therapy 2 distinct population CD patient active disease : 1. patient diagnose &lt; 2 year ago expose aminosalicylates corticosteroid 2. patient exposed immunomodulators and/or anti-TNF agent addition steroid aminosalicylates .</detailed_description>
