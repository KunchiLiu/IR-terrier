	<detailed_description>The co-primary objective : A . To assess effect different dos Paxerol reduction number nocturia episode . B . To assess clinical benefit different dos Paxerol reduce nocturia via assessment nocturia quality life ( NQOL ) . The secondary objective assess effect different dos Paxerol : A . Duration First Undisturbed Sleep ( DFUS ) B . Total hour nightly sleep C. Safety tolerability An exploratory assessment evaluate baseline urinary PGE2 production responsiveness subject Paxerol .
