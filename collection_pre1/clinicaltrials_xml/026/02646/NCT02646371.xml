	<brief_title>Phase 2b Challenge Study With Bioconjugate Vaccine Flexyn2a</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Flexyn2a bioconjugate candidate vaccine able induce humoral immune response specific 2a-antigen Shigella flexneri 2a bacteria . Healthy adult volunteer naïve Shigella flexneri 2a infection screen receive two administration 10 mircograms Flexyn2a placebo 4 week apart . Four week second vaccination , subject challenge 1500 cfu virulent Shigella flexneri 2a strain 2457T . In order ass ability Flexyn2a protect infection strain , attack rate shigellosis group vaccinate Flexyn2a compare group subject receive placebo injection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female age 1850 year ( inclusive ) Good health , without clinically significant medical history physical examination finding . Negative serum pregnancy test screening , negative urine vaccination challenge female subject childbearing potential . Females childbearing potential must agree avoid pregnancy use effective contraception . Abstinence acceptable effective contraception . Female subject unable bear child must document ( e.g . tubal ligation hysterectomy ) . Willingness participate study aspect protocol explain write informed consent obtain . Completion train session demonstrate comprehension protocol procedure , knowledge Shigella‐associated illness , pass score 70 % well write examination . Availability study duration , include plan follow‐up visit . Willingness refrain participate study investigational product completion last study visit . Women currently nurse . Presence significant medical psychiatric condition opinion investigator precludes participation study . Clinically significant abnormality screen hematology serum chemistry determine PI PI consultation research monitor sponsor . Presence serum HIV antibody , HBs‐Ag , HCV antibody ( confirm positive HepC confirmatory test , i.e . RIBA , PCR ) Evidence IgA deficiency ( serum IgA &lt; 7 mg/dl limit detection assay ) . Evidence current excessive alcohol consumption drug dependence . Evidence impair immune function . BMI &lt; 19 ≥35 Recent vaccination receipt investigational product ( within 30 day vaccination last study visit ) . Personal history inflammatory arthritis . Positive blood test HLA‐B27 . Personal history irritable bowel syndrome define Rome III criterion . Treatment immunoglobulins blood product within 3 month first candidate vaccine injection . Regularly abnormal stool pattern ( few 3 per week 3 per day ) loose liquid stool Regular use laxative , antacid , agent low stomach acidity . Use medication know affect immune function ( e.g. , systemic steroid ) within 30 day precede first vaccination plan use entire study period . Known allergy follow antibiotic : ciprofloxacin , trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole penicillin . Symptoms consistent Traveler 's Diarrhea concurrent travel country Shigella infection endemic ( develop world ) within two year prior dose , OR plan travel endemic country length study . Vaccination ingestion Shigella within 3 year prior vaccination . Use antibiotic 7 day vaccination challenge Use proton pump inhibitor , H2 blocker antacid within 48 hour prior challenge . Serum IgG titer Shigella flexneri 2a LPS ≥ 2500 Current occupation involve handle Shigella bacteria History allergy vaccine soy Any criterion , investigator 's opinion , would compromise ability subject participate study , safety study , result study</criteria>
