	<brief_summary>Peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) become well-established complementary alternative haemodialysis ( HD ) first-line renal replacement modality . At department Botucatu Medical School , 60 % chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) stage 5 patient start urgently chronic dialysis due late referral unexpected deterioration residual renal function . These patient , although suitable PD , previously start HD use central venous catheter . Since July 2014 patient offer urgent start chronic PD right PD-catheter insertion percutaneous surgery , use Seldinger technique . The main objective compare technique patient survival unplanned PD vs. unplanned HD first 180 day . Methodology : Quasi experimental study describe acute PD initiate use high volume PD metabolic fluid control right ( &lt; 48 h ) PD catheter placement standard prescription 12 h overnight automatic PD hospital discharge intermittent PD dialysis unit family training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Background : Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) matter global public health . Data United States America ( USA ) show steady increase number patient renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . The census Brazilian Society Nephrology ( SBN ) show 65,121 patient dialysis program 2005 , 2011 91,314 2013 , 100,000 patient dialysis Brazil . Among method dialysis , nephrologists two option : peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) hemodialysis ( HD ) , commonly use method world . Although , historically , PD widely use nephrology , clear reason underutilized last year , especially incident patient RRT . In Brazil , data 2013 show 90.6 % chronic patient underwent HD 9.4 % treated PD . Several study compare difference two type dialysis - PD vs. HD - incident patient RRT . There evidence superiority one method regard general mortality within first two year therapy . Recently , author point impact vascular access use mortality incident patient HD . These study find central venous catheter ( CVC ) use associate reduced survival , especially first 90 day RRT . Furthermore , great risk bacteremia , sepsis hospitalization patient use CVC compare patient use arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) graft PD . In scenario , PD appear option unplanned initiation chronic dialysis . Starting dialysis unplanned manner frequent situation dialysis centre even patient without regular nephrology follow-up . Unplanned dialysis initiation define end-stage renal disease patient begin HD functional vascular access , use CVC start PD le 7 day peritoneal catheter implantation . It show unplanned dialysis use temporary HD catheter independently associate mortality incident dialysis patient . For clear reason , PD underused unplanned dialysis patient . In Brazil , approximately 60 % incident patient RRT definitive access need treat CVC . However , study describe PD method immediate treatment option patient without function vascular access two small study compare unplanned start HD vs. PD . Lobbedez et al follow 2-year period , 60 patient start unplanned dialysis - 34 patient treat PD 26 HD . Among patient start PD , significant difference mechanical infectious complication compare patient `` rest time '' post-catheter insertion . There significant difference two unplanned dialysis method ( HD x DP ) patient survival ( 78.8 % HD group vs. 82.9 % PD ( p = 0.26 ) . After adjust comorbidities index , survival two group remain similar . Koch et al . evaluate 57 incident patient unplanned HD 66 unplanned PD . HD patient bacteremia PD patient first 6 month dialysis ( 21.1 % vs 3 % , p &lt; 0.01 ) , associate use CVC initial access . However , significant difference mortality rate two method . So clearly need show PD suitable method unplanned dialysis patient acute automate PD may help nephrologists deal patient without permanent vascular access dialysis initiation . The investigator believe PD offer advantage use CVC , reduce morbidity mortality CKD patient . In addition , October/2014 , vacancy incident patient chronic HD Dialysis Unit University Hospital Botucatu Medical School , worry fact high complexity service receive average 8 incident patient RRT , monthly . 2 . Objectives : The main objective study compare technique patient survival unplanned PD vs. unplanned HD first 180 day therapy . This study also carry : - To compare rate hospitalization infectious related PD v HD . - To determine impact PD HD program ( grow reduction ) 3 . Methodology 3.1 . Patients : This study quasi experimental study evaluate incident unplanned PD HD patient Dialysis Unit Botucatu Medical School . In attempt increase use PD unplanned dialysis patient , programme devote group patient set since 1 November 2014 . Inclusion criterion CKD patient stage 5 ( creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/min ) require dialysis treatment immediately . Unplanned HD define initiation without definitive vascular access use CVC unplanned PD initiation le 48 hour implantation peritoneal catheter . Absolute contraindication PD method : presence recent abdominal surgery ( le 30 day ) ; multiple previous abdominal surgery ( two ) ; severe respiratory insufficiency ( FiO2 &gt; 70 % ) ; abdominal infection ; severe hyperkalemia change characteristic EKG ; acute pulmonary edema . These patient treat HD . The decision concern dialysis modality make accord medical 's indication patient 's choice . The implant Tenckhoff catheter hold percutaneous Seldinger technique nephrology team . High volume PD ( HVPD ) use first 7 day PD order achieve metabolic fluid control . The procedure acute PD publish recently . When HD modality choice , temporary catheter insert rapidly nephrologist , bedside necessary , one week change tunneled line . Patients follow research team time peritoneal catheter implantation outcome ( stay method minimum period 90 day , death , transplantation , recovery renal function switch HD due technical failure infectious mechanical complication without success treatment ) . 3.2 . Research Protocol : The study protocol consist clinical laboratory data , dialysis monitoring patient PD HD unplanned . 3.2.1 . General data : - Identification : name , gender , age , color - Etiology stage CKD - Presence co-morbidities - Start unplanned dialysis ( date ) - Date peritoneal catheter CVC implantation - Complications implantation catheter - Start date family training ( PD method ) - Date end family training ( PD method ) - Number training day ( PD method ) 3.2.2 . Dialysis : â€¢ Dialysis indication PD : Catheter implantation use Seldinger technique - Prescription : HVPD achieve adequate metabolic fluid control . At point , patient discharge hospital . - Intermitent PD alternate day daily : patient treat PD dialysis unit University Hospital every day every day , accord lab exam clinic exam . Laboratorial exam perform weekly , family train home prepared implementation technique . HD : alternate day Dialysis Unit 3.2.3 . Follow unplanned dialysis patient : - Evaluation mechanical infectious complication relate PD HD - Technique patient survival 3.3 . Statistical Analysis : The sample size calculation base assumption difference 15 % patient undergoing unplanned PD HD outcomes hospitalization , infection mortality . With first-order error 5 % power 80 % sample size 94 patient need treatment group . From study protocol , data enter spreadsheet verified typographical error analysis perform use statistical program SAS Windows ( version 9.2 : SAS Institute , Cary , NC , USA , 2012 ) . Initially descriptive analysis do patient treated period , calculate measure central tendency dispersion continuous variable frequency categorical variable . Patients separate two group accord initiation modality ( unplanned PD group unplanned HD group ) order evaluate impact unplanned PD technique patient survival survival free peritonitis . Intent-to-treat analysis use analyse patient survival . T-test use compare parametric continue variable two group Kruskal-Wallis test nonparametric continue variable . Chi Square use compare categorical variable two group . For analysis repeat measure , asymmetric distribution ( gamma ) GENMOD procedure use . At end study present survival curve use Kaplan Meyer patient method monitoring period . Cox proportional hazard model use adjust survival baseline characteristic . The statistical difference consider significant p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
