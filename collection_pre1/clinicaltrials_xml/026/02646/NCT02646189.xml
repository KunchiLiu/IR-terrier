	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B long term condition cause infection body hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . This infection often result inflammation scar liver eventually lead liver cirrhosis liver failure . These infection also one major cause development hepatocellular carcinoma ( liver cancer ) . Although drug approve treat chronic hepatitis B infection , provide complete cure except rare case ( cure generally mean person lose hepatitis B virus blood liver develop durable immunological control subsequent HBV infection ) . However , drug significantly decrease risk liver damage liver cancer arise presence chronic liver infection slow stop production infectious virus . Thus primary problem associate currently available drug lack clearance virus hepatocytes necessitates long term treatment drug . There clearly need identify new drug benefit patient chronic hepatitis B infection . Nucleic acid-based polymer ( NAPs ) new class broad-spectrum antiviral compound act HBV infection block release surface antigen protein ( HBsAg ) infect hepatocytes . In human patient REP 101 protocol , previous NAP clinical candidate , REP 9AC ( REP 2055 ) , rapidly induce pronounced reduction clearance serum HBsAg 7 8 patient . HBsAg major immunoinhibitory mechanism HBV maintain chronicity reduce eliminate HBsAg blood , REP 9AC appear able elicit restoration durable immunological response patient capable clear HBV infection . The performance REP 9AC provide sustain virologic response ( SVRs ) patient chronic HBV infection appear far superior compound currently approve treatment HBV infection REP 9AC ' ( REP 2139 ) modify version predecessor , REP 9AC ( REP 2055 ) . Both 40mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides comprise alternate adenosine cytidine nucleotide case REP 9AC , show low toxicity highly effective treat hepatitis B infection human patient . The modification REP 9AC ' significantly improve stability reduce pro-inflammatory activity REP 9AC ' compare REP 9AC retain antiviral activity find REP 9AC . Both modification ( 5-methylation cytosine 2 ' O methylation ribose sugar nucleotide ) naturally occur modification human nucleic acid know well tolerated clinical trial . It expect REP 9AC ' able achieve robust antiviral activity patient chronic HBV significantly low dosing requirement few side effect REP 9AC . Current interim data analysis still ongoing REP 101 assess activity REP 9AC patient chronic HBV infection indicate follow : 1 . REP 9AC exposure eight patient generally well tolerated dos 600mg / week 400mg / day ( seven continuous day ) . Administration related side effect include mild moderate pro-inflammatory reaction drug administration ( itch fever ) disappear drug administration complete . Chronic side effect include mild elevation blood anticoagulation ( international normalize ratio ~1.5 ) serum hypocalcemia ( easily mitigate mineral supplement ) . 2 . REP 9AC achieve serum HBsAg reduction clearance patient compliant proscribe dose regimen ( 7 7 ) . 3 . In seven patient , 5 demonstrated restoration least partial immunological control infection ( appearance serum anti-HBs establishment low serum HBV DNA setpoint ) . 4 . Of five patient achieve immunological response , three achieve SVR treatment 20 week REP 9AC treatment complete durable immunological control infection 18 , 12 10.5 month . 5 . Suboptimal stability REP 9AC likely factor impair performance drug . This propose study design demonstrate REP 9AC ' well tolerate give human patient chronically infect HBV evaluate reduction viral titer observe REP 9AC ' administer monotherapy combination immunotherapy . NAPs : Replicor 's technology utilize novel property NAPs inhibit interaction critical viral activity . This technology active vitro know family envelop virus . REPLICor 's proof concept compound , REP 9 ( REP 2006 ) REP 9C ( REP 2031 ) first generation clinical candidate , REP 9AC ( REP 2055 ) also demonstrate potent antiviral activity vivo follow viral infection : HCV , HBV ( DHBV ) , Cytomegalovirus , Herpes Simplex virus-2 , Ebola , influenza respiratory syncytial virus . NAPs ( REP 9 , REP 9C REP 9AC ) administer therapeutically active dos acute chronic regimen multiple route administration ( parenteral , oral , topical aerosol ) mouse , rat , hamster , guinea pig , duck non human primate specie detectable side effect . Moreover , class chemical compound ( phosphorothioate oligonucleotides ) know well tolerated human patient several clinical trial . REPLICor validate compatibility modification REP 9AC ' antiviral activity present NAPs indirectly : 2 ' O methyl sugar modification find affect antiviral activity NAPs duck hepatitis B virus vivo show substantially improve stability NAPs nuclease degradation substantially reduce immunoreactivity human peripheral blood mononuclear cell . The 5'methylation cytosine show affect target interaction cell free interaction assay well know mitigate immunoreactivity nucleic acid . It widely hold notion successful outcome treatment chronic HBV must involve immunostimulation order catalyze restoration appropriate immune response ( adaptive innate ) order achieve durable control HBV infection therapy . The result REP 101 protocol suggest elimination serum HBsAg remove chronic immunosuppression mediate protein . However heterogeneous immunological response HBsAg reduction / clearance patient treated date ( measure serum HBV DNA decline ) : 40 % patient appear exhibit strong immunological response reduction / removal serum HBsAg . This observation strongly suggest HBsAg suppression essential establish durable immunological control , specific immunostimulation may also require many patient order achieve durable immunological control . Thymosin alpha 1 ( Zadaxin™ ) synthetically prepared thymosin alpha 1 polypeptide ( 28 amino acid , molecular weight 3108 ) identical naturally occur thymosin alpha 1 present human . Thymosin alpha 1 share homology interferon alpha family peptide unlike interferon alpha , Zadaxin administration human subject accompany significant side effect . More importantly , Zadaxin administration proinflammatory compound ( like interferon alpha ) alter side effect profile compound . Zadaxin share many immunostimulatory property interferon alpha able stimulate production several cytokine important reestablish immune response capable control HBV infection . Zadaxin also able stimulate production natural killer , CD4 CD8 cell know correlated establishment durable immunological control HBV infection . In treatment chronic HBV clinic , Zadaxin monotherapy able achieve HBeAg HBV DNA seroclearance 30-50 % patient comparable well achievable interferon alpha . More important consistent observation proportion patient achieve HBV DNA seroclearance therapy continually increase ( effect observe interferon alpha ) . Based low side effect profile Zadaxin ( monotherapy combination interferon alpha HBV polymerase inhibitor ) clear ability stimulate functional durable immune response control HBV patient chronic HBV infection , investigator strongly suspect Zadaxin add-on therapy patient currently receive REP 9AC ' safe may synergistic effect ability patient achieve durable immunological control , thus greatly increase proportion patient achieve durable immunological control REP 9AC ' - Zadaxin therapy compare either therapy alone . It may possible immunostimulation provide Zadaxin™ may provide strong broad enough immunostimulatory effect provide additive synergistic antiviral response patient 's immune system REP 9AC ' therapy . Since Pegasys™ much strong immunostimulatory drug significant side effect , dose compound slowly escalate week full dose ( 180 ug weekly ) provide grade 3 adverse event observe .</detailed_description>
