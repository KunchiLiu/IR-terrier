	<brief_summary>With rapid advance molecular oncology , availability preclinical vitro cell model vivo animal model specific genomic aberration critical improve prediction clinical outcome cancer patient . One widely use preclinical model conventional cell line , NCI-60 panel cell line ; cell line widely use preclinical test novel target drug , partially owe low expense reduce labor associate cell culture compare preclinical model , animal xenograft . However , recent study show accumulation genetic aberration cancer cell line occur increase passage number . These model also lack heterogeneity tumor exhibit proper microenvironment , highlight limitation cell-based model . Consistent , Johnson et al . demonstrate vivo activity cell line within NCI-60 panel closely correlate correspond human cancer . Therefore , good preserve genomic integrity tumor heterogeneity observe patient , patient-derived xenograft ( PDX ) model use frequently . PDX generate directly transplant freshly resect patient tumor immunocompromised murine host without intermediate vitro culture step . This PDX model improvement cell line provide appropriate tumor microenvironment heterogeneity tumor cell . However , engraftment success rate growth rate implant tumor highly variable depend tumor type , possibly due insufficient number hematopoietic cell and/or ineffective microenvironmental cue mouse stroma . The extent tumor cell freshly resect tumor able withstand mechanical stress xenotransplantation barrier also unclear . Furthermore , use PDX model application clinical oncology limit owing time require PDX establishment ( &gt; 4 month ) since patient refractory cancer live less 1 year . Recently , PDC line model suggest alternative preclinical model use prediction tool preclinical drug sensitivity . Therefore , study , investigator aim overcome potential barrier pre-existing model examine capacity PDC line model recapitulate histological genomic feature primary patient tumor . In selected case , investigator screen drug sensitivity vitro use PDC line compare result real-life clinical treatment outcome .</brief_summary>
