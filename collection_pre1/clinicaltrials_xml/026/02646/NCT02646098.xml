	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To assess difference overall survival 3 year CD34+ cell selection versus selection hematopoietic progenitor cell harvest peripheral blood stem cell collection high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) advance stage mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) patient . Secondary objective : To assess difference disease-free survival CD34+ cell selection versus selection hematopoietic progenitor cell harvest peripheral blood stem cell collection high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) advance stage mantle cell ( MCL ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) patient . To compare hematologic engraftment time need hematologic recovery ASCT use CD34+ select unselected autologous stem cell graft . To compare infectious complication , particularly CMV infection , observe 100 day ASCT compare CD34+ select unselected autologous stem cell graft . To assess response rate day 100 ASCT advance stage mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) patient ASCT compare patient CD34+ cell selection versus selection . To assess total time need apheresis procedure number apheresis day need ensure collection sufficient number autologous stem cell compare patient CD34+ cell selection versus selection . To assess need additional use G-CSF ( Neupogen ) stem cell release compound Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) ensure collection sufficient number autologous stem cell compare patient CD34+ cell selection versus selection . Outcome ( ) : The aim study show â‰¥ 15 % good 3-year overall survival lymphoma patient receive CD34+ cell selection autologous stem cell collection autologous stem cell transplantation compare CD34+ cell selection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background rationale : Autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) : High-dose chemotherapy ( HDCT ) follow ASCT consider treatment choice relapsed/refractory lymphoma . On basis result PARMA study group trial , high-dose chemotherapy follow ASCT become standard care patient relapse , chemo-sensitive aggressive lymphoma , treatment choice patient relapse diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) , follicular lymphoma ( FL ) Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) . Worldwide , 11'000 patient treated ASCT per year relapse lymphoma . The BEAM chemotherapy regimen frequently use condition regimen ASCT since thirty year . Although HDCT ASCT curative strategy patient aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , relapse progression ASCT major limitation procedure . Together previously describe factor affect outcome ASCT - prognostic score index , clinical response induction salvage chemotherapy , number chemotherapy regimens receive ASCT - graft contamination residual lymphoma cell major factor disease relapse . Graft contamination : Contamination autologous graft residual lymphoma cell demonstrate use several technique include flow cytometry , immunohistochemistry molecular method . Subsequent study suggest contamination lymphoma cell contribute relapse ASCT use mobilized stem cell . A good outcome syngenic transplantation NHL compare ASCT suggest potential clinical benefit purge stem cell graft use SCT . Graft purging : The strategy implement remove lymphoma cell harvest peripheral stem cell include complement-mediated use lymphoma-directed antibody , immunomagnetic bead , immunotoxins , chemotherapeutic agent , well oncolytic virus . Among , CD34+ cell selection alternative theoretically attractive strategy tumor cell removal lymphoma express CD34+ antigen . Various technology use positive selection CD34+ cell , include immunomagnetic bead separation , avidin-biotin immunoaffinity system , fluorescence-activated cell sorting , magnetic-activated cell sort ( MACS ) . The feasibility safety CD34+ purify progenitor cell reinfusion high-dose chemotherapy also demonstrate . Clinical use purge autologous graft : Despite theoretical advantage use purge graft ASCT setting , standard procedure ASCT involve use non-selected graft . Whether use ex vivo purge graft CD34+ cell selection translate improved long-term treatment outcome remain controversial . Noteworthy , single randomize study report far directly compare prospective manner purge unpurged graft ASCT . Thus , randomize prospective direct comparison two procedure long await unmet clinical need presumably immediate impact daily practice ASCT . Own experience purge graft : investigator 's institution long-standing experience CD34+ cell selection apply CliniMACS device ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . The investigator recently summarize data retrospective analysis advance stage lymphoma patient compare 31 patient CD34+ cell selection versus 31 patient without selection ( include 32 MCL 30 DLBCL patient ) . Remarkably , investigator find 5-year OS select versus select ASCT patient 87 % 53 % ( p=0.004 ) , 5-year PFS 62 % 38 % ( p=0.031 ) , respectively . These retrospective data suggest use select autograft ASCT advance stage MCL DLBCL associate significantly longer OS PFS without increase toxicity , infectious complication impaired engraftment . Finally , investigator propose data provide rationale initiate prospective randomize study use CD34+ cell selection graft use ASCT patient advanced-stage aggressive lymphoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible patient advanced stage ( stage III IV ) malignant lymphomas include mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) first second remission patient diffuse large Bcell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) first second remission plan undergo subsequent consolidation standard highdose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation . Patients must age 1875 year , must give voluntary write informed consent . Negative pregnancy test ( urine serum ) within 14 day prior registration woman childbearing potential . Patients childbearing potential must implement adequate measure ( hormonal treatment p.o . i.m. , intra uterine surgical device , latex condom ) avoid pregnancy study treatment additional 12 month . No pregnant lactating patient allow . Patients fit autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . Patients serious medical condition interfere completion treatment accord protocol would impair tolerance therapy prolong hematological recovery . Noteworthy , patient seropositivity HIV Hepatitis B C exclude study otherwise consider fit ASCT . Acute uncontrolled infection Relevant coexist disease exclude treatment accord protocol HCTCI &gt; 10 Previous concurrent malignant disease exception basalioma/spinalioma skin , earlystage cervix carcinoma , earlystage prostate cancer . Lack patient cooperation allow study treatment outline protocol . Pregnant lactate female patient . Major coagulopathy bleed disorder . Major surgery le 30 day start treatment .</criteria>
