	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study Patients With Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy Brazil ( SaMi_Trop Project )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH STRATEGY SIGNIFICANCE The Sao Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center ( SaMi-Trop ) consist network collaborate scientist States Minas Gerais São Paulo establish purpose develop conduct research project neglect infectious disease Brazil , initial focus Chagas Disease biomarker , discovery validation . The SaMi-Trop represent major challenge focus research neglect disease , knowledge apply primary health care . Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy ( CCC ) important clinical presentation Chagas Disease ( ChD ) , eventually affect approximately 20 % 30 % chronic phase disease . CCC comprise wide range manifestation , include heart failure , arrhythmia , heart-blocks , sudden death , thromboembolism stroke [ 1 ] . Clinical presentation typically vary widely accord degree myocardial damage patient present mild form heart disease , frequently characterize presence asymptomatic abnormality ECG complimentary exam [ 2 ] . Nonetheless , heart failure and/or severe arrhythmia manifest , prognosis ominous , high premature mortality rate , typically adult male patients,1 also elderly [ 3 ] . Indeed , compare patient idiopathic cardiomyopathy , patient CCC poorer survival , irrespective clinical echocardiographic parameter [ 4 ] . Thus , clinical course Chagas heart disease variable identifying patient risk progressive CCC dying remain challenge . Several longitudinal study perform patient chronic phase ChD demonstrate many individual characteristic predict unfavorable prognosis . This subject systematically review year ago conclude study describe insufficient detail and/or lack minimal standard report result . Results somewhat inconsistent different study , best combination clinical laboratory variable predictive mortality yet establish [ 5 ] . A potentially helpful score predict death develop permit stratification risk Chagas heart disease [ 6 ] . Six independent prognostic factor identify , assign number point : New York Heart Association class III IV ( 5 point ) , evidence cardiomegaly radiography ( 5 point ) , leave ventricular systolic dysfunction echocardiography ( 3 point ) , non-sustained ventricular tachycardia 24-hour Holter monitoring stress test ( 3 point ) , low QRS voltage electrocardiography ( 2 point ) , male sex ( 2 point ) [ 6 . Patients classify three risk group accord final score : low risk ( 0 6 point ) , intermediate risk ( 7 11 point ) , high risk ( 12 20 point ) . In original study , 5-year mortality rate three group 2 percent , 18 percent , 63 percent , respectively.6 Although score successfully validated independent cohort , [ 6,7 ] important issue may arise . The derivation score complex easy calculate medical consultation . To calculate , patient must submit several exam procedure , include clinical examination , ECG , Chest x-ray , echocardiogram Holter monitoring stress test . Most test available rural area , ChD patient live . A simple score , base widely available low-cost test , could stratify risk death without complex calculation , might useful primary care setting , echocardiograms Holter monitoring widely available . Easily obtain variable , clinical feature , BNP level ECG measurement , good candidate biomarkers develop new simple predictive rule . Moreover , new biomarkers blood , relate mainly inflammation immune response , TNF-alpha , adhesion molecule cytokine , may determine potent prognostic factor may useful future improvement risk stratification CCC . METHOD Design Non-concurrent prospective open cohort study , minimal follow-up two year ( baseline 24 month ) . Outcome Primary : death Secondary : hospitalization due cardiac condition ; new ECG abnormality Study Population Participants select patient evaluate Tele Minas Saude ( TMS ) , state Tele Health System . Since TeleHealth System currently act support Primary Care system , patient care primary care physicians Health Family Strategy , public primary care program high coverage state Minas Gerais . The inclusion criterion client TMS TeleHealth System , &gt; 18 year old , positive history T cruzi infection Chagas disease , abnormal ECG consent participate research program . The exclusion criterion include pregnancy breast feeding , severe condition ominous prognosis indicate life expectancy less two year . Sample size patient accrual Considering minimal number event per variable acceptable proportional hazard regression analysis 10 event per variable,8 maximal number study variable ten , number event would 100 whole study . Since prediction model develop validated whole sample divide two , number event 200 . For 2-year follow-up period annual mortality rate 5 % CCC ( 10 % 2 year ) , calculate sample size 2,000 subject . Since TMS Telehealth system perform 25,000 ECGs month ( 300,000 year ) , ECG abnormalities typical CCC observe 5 % exam ( 1,250 ) , project 10 % patient would recruit agree participate research program , calculate sample size 2,000 patient recruit 16 month ' accrual period . Follow-up Follow-up conduct yearly basis , standardize interview new ECG exam perform two year baseline . Vital status hospitalization also ascertain linkage study database mortality hospitalization databases Ministry Health . Recruitment , initial evaluation measurement Patients recruit among regularly attend public primary care service State Minas Gerais place serve TMS Telehealth System . This system provide teleconsultation Electrocardiogram service ( TeleECG ) , include interpretation ECGs cardiologist University Hospital . A standardized simple form complete transmission ECG data University hospital question `` Do know Chagas disease ? '' add questionnaire . Those answer yes question abnormal ECG select . A second visit select patient schedule perform short questionnaire ( include evaluation functional class ) collect blood sample . Blood sample send central laboratory T. cruzi serology BNP measurement , do standard technique . Other blood sample , include plasma protein antibody study stabilize whole blood lysates T cruzi PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction ) , DNA , store -80o C enable batch test biomarkers . Electrocardiogram service ( TeleECG ) The ECG perform town origin patient send assessed TMS Telehealth System specialist . The Telecardiology activity develop use digital electrocardiograph instal town , Basic Health Units public healthcare system . The examination always carry requested physician . The ECG send use communication software develop TMS Telehealth System analyze on-duty cardiologist . The report send Primary Care facility ECG tracing transfer ECG read center . In ECG Reading Center , software develop Prof. Peter Mac Farlane , Glasgow University , analyze codify ECG ( Minnesota Code ) compare previous ECG , accord validate algorithm [ 9 ] . All abnormal code review experienced cardiologist . Data analysis The standardized mortality ratio ( SMR ) analysis survival analysis conduct . The outcome death death . Also , survival analysis consider secondary outcome - hospitalization due cardiac condition new ECG abnormalities - run . The development validation prognostic model follow current recommendation , include division sample derivation validation sample , use modern method evaluate performance model [ 10,11 ] . Additionally , descriptive spatial analysis use geographic distribution SMR Bayesian spatial model small area data run . Innovation Beyond relevance main goal study , many unique innovative aspect , relate use knowledge infra-structure developed project conduct research group : 1 . The possibility test new biomarkers detect branch study NIH-sponsored REDS-II/III Chagas disease study . 2 . The use infrastructure logistics TMS program , state-wide TeleHealth System coordinate University Hospital Brazilian state Minas Gerais 3 . The use methodology linkage databases administrative mortality databases Health Ministry complement follow-up select patient 4 . A standardized codification system ECGs , use facility ECG Reading Center long-term longitudinal study health 15,000 adult public servant Brazilian Universities ( ELSA-Brazil ) . New biomarkers ChD complex physiopathology many immunological , inflammatory , autonomic micro-vascular process role development progression disease [ 12 ] . The investigator describe increased level macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP-1alpha ) Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) ChD patient , [ 13-15 ] patient severe form elevate level [ 13 ] . Recently , ChD study ( REDS-II ) , study 600 ChD patient 500 control search biomarkers related disease CCC . In preliminary analysis , several biomarkers include high sensitivity troponin , myoglobin , soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( sVCAM-1 ) , soluble intracellular cell adhesion molecule ( sICAM ) myeloperoxidase show abnormal pattern T cruzi seropositive parasitemic donor CCC patient . These biomarkers , include identify transcriptome analysis candidate study whole cohort 2,000 CCC patient TMS program , alternatively , use nested case-control design . Tele Minas Saude ( TMS ) Program , state-wide public TeleHealth System The TMS program partnership Minas Gerais State Health Department State Research Agency ( FAPEMIG ) six public university Minas Gerais : Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) , Universidade Federal Triângulo Mineiro ( UFTM ) , Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros ( UNIMONTES ) , Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora ( UFJF ) , Universidade Federal de São João del-Rei ( UFSJ ) Universidade Federal de Uberlândia ( UFU ) , form Teleassistance Network Minas Gerais . Created telehealth pilot project cardiology ( 2006 ) , later expand specialty village transform permanent telehealth service , subsidized state government 2009 [ 16-18 ] . The objective support infrastructure project state public health , initially deploy support Primary Health Care Family Health Teams [ 16 ] . At stage , main objective assist professional daily work improve access specialized service , reduce qualify referral patient secondary tertiary care . The main activity offer ) duty teleconsultation offline various medical specialty , nursing , dentistry , physiotherapy , psychology , pharmacy nutrition , b ) duty telecardiology analyze electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) provide teleconsultations online critical clinical case c ) technical support online offline , ) permanent education workshop train e ) continuous monitoring system operation municipality . So far , program implement 608 municipality state correspond 732 telehealth site . The primary care unit village equip computer , electrocardiograph , digital printer digital camera . Universities equip workstation videoconferencing equipment . Since 2006 , 20,000 teleconsultations conduct 600,000 ECGs analyze expert . These telehealth activity prevent displacement patient 78 % case [ 16 ] . Linkage databases The Brazilian Health System characterize coexistence universal public health system ( 70-80 % coverage ) supplementary private network . Mortality data Brazilians hospitalization public health system store large database own manage Health Ministry . Investigators develop methodology search database specific subject use probabilistic linkage method . The probabilistic strategy develop high accuracy , sensitivity 90.6 % specificity 100 % [ 19 ] . This method use complimentary way direct follow-up . ECG Reading Center ECG interpretation subject substantial intra- inter-observer variability . To overcome problem , standardize ECG code develop 50 year ago 20 widely use epidemiological study . The visual classification ECG use Minnesota code , nonetheless , time consuming . The investigator create ECG Reading Center Elsa study , 10-year longitudinal cohort study 15,000 public employee Brazilian Universities . For ECG Reading Center , instal software develop Prof. Peter MacFarlane , Glasgow University , analyze , codifies compare ECG previous tracing , accord validate algorithm [ 9 ] . This system use present project . Preliminary Studies Diagnostic prognostic value BNP In 2002 , investigator describe , study publish The Lancet , blood level BNP inversely correlate systolic leave ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction , use index LV function ChD [ 21 ] . In patient abnormal ECG and/or chest X-Ray , BNP elevation positive predictive value 80 % negative predictive value 97 % detection patient depress left ventricular ejection fraction [ 21 ] . This result confirm follow year several study research group [ 22-26 ] . A diagnostic strategy include ECG BNP perform well classical approach ECG chest X-Ray [ 24 ] . Moreover , BNP also marker ventricular arrhythmia [ 26 ] diastolic dysfunction [ 22,27 ] . More recently , describe BNP level strong predictor risk death [ 28 ] cohort 1,398 indwell elderly city Bambuí , state Minas Gerais , Brazil [ 28 ] . The hazard ratio death 1.27 unit log-transformed BNP level ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI : 1.11 , 1.45 ) among infected person , independent potentially confound factor . Infected person baseline BNP level top quartile risk death twice person bottom quartile ( hazard ratio = 2.07 , 95 % CI : 1.29 , 3.32 ) . In population , find BNP alone association atrial fibrillation prognostic value stroke mortality T. cruzi chronically infected old adult [ 29 ] . Electrocardiographic measure prognostic model The ECG single important exam CCC . Numerous epidemiological study show patient normal ECG excellent medium-term survival [ 30,31 ] . The great number severity ECG alteration register tracing , advance myocardial damage possibly , bad prognosis [ 12 ] . We show QRS duration moderately correlate LV ejection fraction [ 32 ] , follow-up patient , increase duration QRS complex appearance new electrocardiographic alteration may help identify patient significant decrease ( 5 % ) leave ventricle ejection fraction [ 33 ] . Based well-known prognostic value LV ejection fraction presence ventricular tachycardia , [ 5 ] propose alternative approach well establish Rassi 's score , [ 34,35 ] consider three risk factor : leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % , ventricular tachycardia either stress test Holter monitoring , QRS &gt; 133 m ECG ( filter QRS &gt; 150 ms signal-averaged ECG ) .34,35 Low risk group zero one risk factor ( 5-year mortality : 1 % ) , intermediate risk , two factor ( 20 % mortality ) , high risk , three factor ( 50 % mortality ) . This simplify prognostic score excellent performance predict death study 74 month follow ( c statistic 0.92 ) may attractive alternative establish six-factor score . More recently , investigator show T-wave amplitude variability ( TWV ) , sophisticated ECG-derived measure repolarization variability , independently relate risk death ChD [ 36 ] . They also study prognostic value several new echocardiographic measure [ 37-39 ] could physiopathological clinical relevance , possible used ambulatory patient rural area . Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrate mortality Chagas disease patient Classified accord presence prolong QRS &gt; 133 m ECG ; Classified accord risk score follow factor worth one point : ventricular tachycardia either stress test Holter monitoring , leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 0.50 , QRS &gt; 133 m ECG . Low risk group zero one risk factor , intermediate risk , two factor , high risk , three factor . Summarizing , although others investigator extensively study prognostic marker Chagas disease CCC , definite simple , low-cost prognostic model available use primary care set . Standard ECG BNP level good candidate select simplify predictive model .</detailed_description>
