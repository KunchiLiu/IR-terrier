	<brief_title>Therapeutic Safety Efficacy REP 9AC ( REP 2055 ) HBV HCV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B C long term condition cause infection body hepatitis B ( HBV ) C ( HCV ) viruses . These infection often result inflammation scarring liver eventually lead liver cirrhosis liver failure . These infection also one major cause development hepatocellular carcinoma ( liver cancer ) . Although drug approve treat chronic hepatitis B infection , provide complete cure except rare case ( cure generally mean person lose hepatitis B virus develop protective surface antibody ) . However , drug significantly decrease risk liver damage infection slow stop virus reproduce . Amongst problem associate currently available drug tendency develop resistance lack clearance virus hepatocytes . There clearly need identify new drug benefit patient chronic hepatitis B infection . REP 9AC 40mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide show low toxicity highly effective treat hepatitis B infection animal . It show effective protect animal infection treat animal already infect . The efficacy REP 9AC ( REP 2055 ) duck hepatitis B test collaboration Dr. Allison Jilbert ( University Adelaide , Australia ) , recognize expert HBV infection . These result suggest REP 2055 completely eliminate disease large proportion ( 50 % ) animal follow 4 week treatment . In word , follow cessation treatment , viral titer return . If result replicate human , result paradigm shift patient hepatitis B treat . Currently available drug control disease . Once stop , viral titer return . This propose study design demonstrate REP9AC well tolerate give human patient chronically infect HBV evaluate reduction viral titer observe REP 9AC administer monotherapy . Current interim data analysis REP 101 trial indicates follow : 1 . REP 9AC generally well tolerated dos 600mg / week patient currently enrol HBV patient 400mg / day ( seven continuous day ) . 2 . REP 9AC resulted HBV patient achieve protective seroconversion ( anti-HBs ) clearance HBV DNA HBsAg blood 23 week initiation treatment . 3 . Increasing frequency dose REP 9AC treatment start therapy may provide rapid seroconversion HBV patient . 4 . Increasing frequency dose REP 9AC treatment start therapy may provide good efficacy HCV patient . Hepatitis C. Recent advance treatment hepatitis C , use interferon ribavirin combination therapy , bring overall response rate 50 % response associate significant cost toxicity . In view lack response many patient standard therapy view associate toxicity , development new therapeutic strategy critically important . Amphipathic polymer show broad spectrum antiviral activity favorable pharmacokinetics liver make ideal candidate therapy viral hepatitis B C. In collaboration Dr. Jake Liang , ( Head , Liver Diseases Branch , National Institute Health , USA ) , REP 9AC show provide complete protection HCV infection naïve animal . REP 9AC perfectly suit treatment chronic HCV infection exposure drug allow liver naturally eliminate infected cell halt continual cycle infection healthy liver cell . REP 9AC may eventually replace pegylated interferon ribavirin standard care owe activity genotype HCV novel mechanism action , promote generation drug resistance . An entry inhibitor could useful use combination therapy could effective monotherapy . This propose study design demonstrate REP 9AC well tolerated give patient chronically infect HCV evaluate reduction viral titer observe REP 9AC administer monotherapy . REPLICor 's technology utilize novel property modify oligonucleotides ( phosphorothioate oligonucleotides ) amphipathic polymer inhibit interaction critical viral activity . This technology active vitro know family envelop virus . REPLICor 's proof concept compound , REP 9 ( REP 2006 ) REP 9C ( REP 2031 ) lead compound , REP 9AC ( REP 2055 ) also demonstrate potent antiviral activity vivo follow viral infection : HCV , HBV ( DHBV ) , Cytomegalovirus , Herpes simplex virus-2 , Ebola , influenza respiratory syncytial virus . REP 9 , REP 9C REP 9AC administer therapeutically active dos acute chronic regimen multiple route administration ( parenteral , oral , topical aerosol ) mouse , rat , hamster , guinea pig , duck non human primate specie detectable side effect . Moreover , class chemical compound ( phosphorothioate oligonucleotides ) know well tolerated human patient several clinical trial .</detailed_description>
