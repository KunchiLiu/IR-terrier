	<brief_summary>Based part pivotal study conduct Mali , SMC approve WHO policy malaria control country seasonal malaria transmission Mali March 2012 . The goal identify effective method deliver SMC , obtain information long term impact SMC malaria immunity . Our specific aim 1 ) determine optimal mode ( fixed-point ( FPD ) vs door-to-door delivery ( DDD ) ; directly observe treatment ( DOT ) vs non-DOT ( NDOT ) ) frequency ( 3 vs 4 dos per season ) SMC delivery ; 2 ) compare quantitative measure immunity child receive SMC . A cluster-randomized design sue . The target population child age 3-59 month old Ouelessebougou district , Mali . In Year 1 , village four sub-districts randomize four group ( FPD+DOT ; FPD+NDOT ; DDD+DOT ; DDD+NDOT ) . The optimal mode delivery select base SMC coverage first year , implement village two additional sub-districts . Villages two newly select sub-districts randomize two group . Children first group receive three round SMC second group receive four round SMC determine optimal frequency SMC base incidence rate clinical malaria measure passive surveillance . In Year 3 , child select sub-districts receive SMC optimal delivery system determine Years 1 -2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention ( SMC ) Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based part pivotal study conduct Mali , SMC approve WHO policy malaria control country seasonal malaria transmission Mali March 2012 . The strategy highly cost-effective approach reduce childhood mortality area . Despite huge benefit SMC malaria infection disease , optimal approach deliver SMC remain determined data long term effect strategy development immunity malaria . While fixed-point delivery ( FPD ) combine non directly observe treatment ( NDOT ) community health worker attractive SMC implementation , need evaluate compare mode delivery . The objective identify effective method deliver SMC , obtain information long term impact SMC malaria immunity . Specifically , ) determine optimal mode ( fixed-point ( FPD ) vs door-to-door delivery ( DDD ) ; directly observe treatment ( DOT ) vs. non-DOT ( NDOT ) ) frequency ( 3 vs. 4 dos per season ) SMC delivery ; ii ) compare quantitative measure immunity child receive SMC three year period . The design cluster-randomized trial three year . The target population child age 3-59 month old living Ouelessebougou district , Mali . In Year 1 , village four sub-districts randomize four group ( FPD+DOT ; FPD+NDOT ; DDD+DOT ; DDD+NDOT ) . The optimal mode delivery select base SMC coverage first year , implement village two additional sub-districts . Villages two newly select sub-districts randomize two group . Children first group receive three round SMC second group receive four round SMC determine optimal frequency SMC base incidence rate clinical malaria measure passive surveillance . Children four sub-districts select Year 1 continue receive three round SMC Year 2 use optimal mode delivery . In Year 3 , child randomly select sub-districts receive SMC optimal delivery system determine Years 1 -2 . Immune responses measure compare child receive SMC cohort child receive SMC , assess impact SMC key antimalarial antibody response three year period use cross-sectional survey begin end transmission season .</detailed_description>
