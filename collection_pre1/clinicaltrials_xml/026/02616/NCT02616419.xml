	<brief_summary>Since late 1980s , several study focus pediatric procedural pain show still underevaluated undertreated , especially Emergency Department ( ED ) . Needle-related procedure important source pain anxiety child . Since impossible completely eliminate pain anxiety experience child painful procedure , use non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological intervention might beneficial . Most method use relief procedural pain anxiety child require time extra staff , represent barrier implantation ED . An easy-to-use rapid non-pharmacological intervention could overcome constraint optimize procedural pain anxiety relief child undergo needle-related procedure . The primary objective study determine device combine cold vibration ( Buzzy® ) non-inferior ( bad ) topical anesthetic cream ( lidocaine liposomal 4 % ) procedural pain management child undergo needle-related procedure ED . Investigators strongly believe use Buzzy® device ED improve significantly pain anxiety felt child undergo needle-related procedure . Since EDs usually chaotic busy , easy-to-use rapid non-pharmacological intervention like Buzzy® , surely adopt nursing personnel useful tool procedural pain . Given knowledge , investigator feel randomize controlled trial potential improve nursing practice optimize painful experience child undergo needle-related procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since 1980s , several research focus paediatric procedural pain learn nature , cause , consequence , assessment treatment . However , decade later , still undervalue undertreated , especially Emergency Department ( ED ) . Thus , child experience high level pain anxiety ED painful procedure , could due multiple factor : lack knowledge regard pain management intervention , lack time , work overload , limited space interruption continuity care . Needle-related procedure ( venipuncture , IV access , s/c , IM ) important source pain distress child . A study show 31 % child benefit procedural pain management insertion IV access le 1 % venipuncture . Inadequate procedural pain anxiety relief child without consequence . These effect may physiological , psychological emotional long-term impact . Since impossible completely eliminate pain anxiety experience child needle-related procedure , relief non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological intervention essential . Most relief method procedural pain anxiety available child require much time staff , represent barrier regard implantation ED . The use rapid easy-to-use non-pharmacological intervention could overcome constraint optimize procedural pain anxiety relief child . In 2009 , new device ( Buzzy® ) , combine cold ( ice wing ) vibration ( bee 's body ) , develop USA relief pediatric procedural pain . This device rely Gate Control Theory well diffuse noxious inhibitory control modulation pain response ( Baxter et al. , 2009 ) . Efficacy Buzzy® device pediatric patient ED evaluate two study date . Both study show significant result regard control post-procedural pain post-procedural anxiety . So far , study conduct Canada none compare effect Buzzy .

The study evaluate efficacy present several limitation , small sample size absence intervention control group . To date , study conduct Canada none compare effect gold standard intervention needle-related procedure , topical anesthetic cream . Objective : The primary aim study determine device combine cold vibration ( Buzzy® ) non-inferior ( bad ) lidocaine liposomal 4 % procedural pain management child undergo needle-related procedure ED . Methods : Design : This study two-arm , randomize , control , non-inferiority trial . Setting : Pediatric ED university health center Montreal . Inclusion criterion : Investigators include child : 1 ) Ages 4-17 year old ; 2 ) Visiting ED ; 3 ) Requiring needle-related procedure ( venipuncture IV catheter insertion ) ; 4 ) Understanding speak either French English ; 5 ) Having least one parent ( legal guardian ) understand , read talk French English . Exclusion criterion : Investigators exclude child : 1 ) A neuro-cognitive impairment precludes inform consent and/or assent , 2 ) An inability self-report pain , 3 ) A critical unstable health . Interventions : Arm 1 ( Buzzy® device ) : Just needle-related procedure , Buzzy® device ( combine ice pack vibration integrate plastic bee ) apply 5 cm needle insertion site maintain place throughout painful procedure . Arm 2 ( lidocaine liposomal 4 % ) : The topical anesthetic cream apply 30 minute needle-related procedure insertion site . Randomization Allocation : A independent biostatistician generate sequence randomization stratify age ( 4-7 ; 8-12 ; 13-17 ) use permute block size stratum . Enrolled participant randomly assign one two arm 1:1 allocation ratio . Sample size : Using non-inferiority margin 0.7 scale 0 10 mean per-procedural pain , total 380 participant ( 190/group ) necessary achieve power 90 % one-sided 5 % significance . Primary outcome : The primary outcome mean per-procedural pain score Color Analogue Scale ( CAS ) . Secondary outcome : ) Mean per-procedural pain score Faces-Pain Scale Revised ( FPS-R ) , b ) Mean level per-procedural distress use Procedure Behavior Check List ( PBCL ) Children 's Fear Scale ( CFS ) , c ) Memory pain 24 hour needle-related procedure FPS-R. d_ Proportion child success needle-related procedure first attempt , e ) Self-reported level satisfaction child , parent nurse questionnaire previously developped team . Analyses : All analysis perform intention-to-treat per-protocol principle . Regarding primary outcome , mean difference pain score experimental group ( Buzzy® device ) control group ( lidocaine liposomal 4 % ) along low confidence limit calculate . If limit lie within ( -∞,0.7 ) , null hypothesis inferiority reject favor alternative hypothesis 5 % significance level . A similar approach use secondary outcome ( , b , c ) . Proportion child success procedure first attempt compare use chi-square test . Descriptive statistic use report data satisfaction . ANCOVA perform covariate increase statistical power . Subgroups analyse perform accord age group ( 4-7 ; 8-12 ; 13-17 ) . Relevance : This propose work first RCT Canada ass efficacy Buzzy® device procedural pain anxiety relief child undergo needle-related procedure . Very study pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention exist , intervention identify optimal pain anxiety management context ED . Investigators strongly believe use Buzzy® device child undergo needle-related procedure would optimize nursing practice improve pain anxiety experience child visit ED .</detailed_description>
