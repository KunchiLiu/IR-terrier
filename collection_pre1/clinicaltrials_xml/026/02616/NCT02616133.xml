	<brief_title>HER2+ Breast Cancer Neo-Adjuvant Coordination Care Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HER2+ Breast Cancer Neo-Adjuvant Coordination Care Program evaluate feasibility , effectiveness , adoption evidence base medicine patient HER2+ breast cancer care coordination application host CECity 's MedConcert™ platform . The goal implement evidence practice use exist patient data , improve care base knowledge enable care coordination medical oncologist surgeon . PHASE 1 : Workflow Design The steer committee Duke create workflow process relate HER2+ Neo-Adjuvant Therapy Treatment . The goal workflow establish coordinate approach care identify key step process . The workflow identify patient timely engagement multidisciplinary team ; pre-treatment assessment perform ; neo-adjuvant therapy treatment prescribe ; appropriate management adherence treatment prescribe occur ; surgery perform identification type surgery ; subsequent therapy prescribed . Data collection perform step workflow . PHASE 2 : Engagement Three site identify participate project . Each affiliated Duke Cancer Network free standing hospital system clinic . A coordinator designate site guide process , enter data communicate patient progress sit multidisciplinary project team . Routine communication maintain site project team ensure timely resolution issue answer question . PHASE 3 : Feedback Performance measure identify data collect aggregated . The data display performance monitor CECity MedConcert™ application provide feedback provider performance relate measure . Providers also provide access educational resource improvement opportunity application . PHASE 4 : Assessment Change Dissemination Findings Currently , many patient HER2+ Breast Cancer opportunity evaluate oncologist neo-adjuvant treatment lack coordinate care surgeon oncologists . This project evaluate adopt evidence-based medicine patient HER2+ use coordinate care application . The goal facilitate great coordination care oncologists surgeon identify intervention improve care . A final report outline result coordinate care approach . The result QI initiative develop manuscript publication .</detailed_description>
