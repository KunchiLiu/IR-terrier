	<detailed_description>Triflusal , 2- ( acetyloxy ) -4- ( trifluoromethyl ) benzoic acid , antiplatelet agent chemical structure similar aspirin , different pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile . The drug administer orally bioavailability range 83 % 100 % . It bind almost entirely ( 99 % ) plasma proteins cross readily organic barrier . Triflusal deacetylated liver , form main metabolite 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethyl benzoic acid ( HTB ) . In contrast inactive aspirin metabolite salicylic acid , HTB exhibit antiplatelet activity long plasma half-life approximately 40h . Triflusal irreversibly inhibit COX-1 reduces TxA2 production , less extent compare aspirin . It inhibit COX-1 AA metabolism selectively platelet , preserve PGI2 synthesis vascular endothelial cell 1 . Except platelet COX-1 triflusal particular HTB inhibit phosphodiesterase , enzyme degrades cyclic nucleotide , cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( c-AMP ) cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( c-GMP ) , inhibit platelet function . Triflusal similar aspirin efficacy secondary prevention vascular event patient acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) stroke , reduce incidence intracranial gastrointestinal haemorrhage compare aspirin . It note triflusal well tolerated patient aspirin-induced asthma . Aspirin ( acetyl salicylic acid ) remain 50 year cornerstone antiplatelet therapy due proven clinical benefit good cost effectiveness profile . Aspirin selectively irreversibly acetylate hydroxyl group single serine residue position 529 within polypeptide chain PGH synthase-1 . Thus aspirin inhibits COX-1 activity affect hydroperoxidase activity PGH synthase-1 . By block COX-1 , production TXA2 reduce , lead reduce platelet aggregation . Aspirin improve clinical outcome cardiovascular syndrome primary secondary prevention , include acute event . In high-risk patient , aspirin substantially reduces risk vascular death ~15 % non-fatal vascular event ~30 % report meta-analysis 100 large-scale randomize trial . Several study last year suggest proportion patient ( 5 65 % ) exhibit hyporesponsiveness ( resistance ) aspirin treatment could associate recurrent ischemic event . Aspirin resistance may result several cause , low compliance , interference non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) protein glycation occur type 2 diabetes mellitus . Increased platelet turnover observe various disease ACS , peripheral arterial disease diabetic angiopathy associate faster re-appearance newly form , non aspirinated platelet , may also account aspirin resistance . Although triflusal chemically relate aspirin similar effectiveness , appear good tolerability profile aspirin . Results large-scale clinical trial meta-analysis suggest use may preferable aspirin , several clinical setting antiplatelet therapy indicate . Furthermore , select population , geriatric patient , increase risk bleed complication , patient suffer asthma , chronic sinusitis nasal polyp , case aspirin resistance , triflusal may choice worth consider . Furthermore , combination antiplatelet-fibrinolytic antiplatelet-anticoagulant therapy need , clinical data support triflusal use base efficacy well safety aspirin . Unlike aspirin , triflusal , also , less likely affect efficacy antihypertensive drug , especially angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor . The aim present trial investigate efficacy safety triflusal comparison aspirin patient stable coronary artery disease ( CAD ) history acute non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke .</detailed_description>
