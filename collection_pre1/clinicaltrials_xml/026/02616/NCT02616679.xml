	<brief_summary>The current study aim validate several novel cognitive task expect sensitive brain impairment specific anatomic region affect preclinical Alzheimer 's disease ( pAD ) . The task validate 60 cognitively clinically normal participant age 60 - 85 , inclusive , reasonably well-established biomarkers Alzheimer 's disease , include 1 ) simultaneous positron emission tomography ( PET ) [ 18F ] Flutemetamol amyloid CT image 2 ) extent data available study , participant ' brain MRI cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) amyloid tau .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Detection Preclinical AD : Validation Using Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biomarkers , amyloid deposition , Hipp volume loss , low AÎ² high pTau CSF , useful identify cognitively normal ( CN ) elderly likely early AD pathology ( `` preclinical AD '' ) . However , invasive and/or expensive . The goal current study develop validate cognitive proxy AD biomarkers use cognitive task dependent brain region impair early AD pathology . If successful , tasks provide non-invasive cost-effective way identify track change CN individual high risk progress mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) dementia stage AD thus facilitate future prevention trial pAD . Subjects attend three study visit . During first study visit , subject eligibility criterion confirm , blood sample drawn , complete half cognitive task . The second visit , occur within one week visit one , involve completion remain cognitive task . Subjects also ask PET-CT scan visit three ( occur within 3 month visit 1 2 ) .</detailed_description>
