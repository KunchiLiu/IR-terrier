Patients may receive osimertinib rociletinib , agent inhibit T790M EGFR mutation , receive least 14 day treatment erlotinib , afatinib , gefitinib CNS peripheral progression At least one measurable BM RECIST 1.1 criterion ( ≥ 10mm long diameter ) . Target lesion must receive stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRS ) . If subject prior whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) , progression measurable BM lesion must occur least 3 month end WBRT . Subjects asymptomatic brain metastasis may enrol without prior radiation therapy brain . Subjects minimally symptomatic brain metastasis may enrol without prior radiation therapy brain require immediate surgical radiation therapy opinion treat investigator opinion radiation therapy neurosurgical consultant Subjects Cohort A may asymptomatic LM detect MRI .
