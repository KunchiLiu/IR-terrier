	<brief_title>MRI Guided HIFU Palliation Painful Skeletal Metastases Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study determine MR-guided high intensity focus ultrasound ( MR-HIFU ) effective technique alleviate pain associate bone metastases paediatric cancer patient . This technique mean adjunct therapy standard-of-care , include radiation therapy chemotherapy . Safety technique assess evaluate non-targeted heating use MRI-based temperature mapping , inspect patient post-treatment skin burn . sign serious adverse event . Efficacy technique assess evaluating/recording patient observe pain , quality life , pain medication usage 3 month follow treatment .</detailed_description>
