	<brief_title>A Study Assess Feasibility Romidepsin Combined With Brentuximab Vedotin Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This traditional `` 3+3 '' phase 1 dose de-escalation design test 3 dose level romidepsin conjunction brentuximab vedotin patient untreated previously treat ( 2 prior systemic regimen , include photopheresis ) CTCL . Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) determine cycle 1 . The first 3 subject begin dose level 1 . If DLT encounter another 3 subject enrol dose level . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) dose level ≤ 1 6 subject experience DLT . If one subject one dose level encounter DLT , dose de-escalated subsequent subject . Should DLTs occur , investigator escalate beyond dose level 1 . Once MTD confirm , investigator enroll additional 9 patient toxicity refinement cohort total 15 evaluable patient MTD . Treatment continue 16 cycle ( one cycle 28 day ) disease progression toxicity , whichever occur first . Drugs continue 16 cycle patient derive clinical benefit treatment discussion sponsor-investigator .</detailed_description>
