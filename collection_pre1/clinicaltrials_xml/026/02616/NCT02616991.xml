	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether systematically perform compute tomography ( CT ) venography ( i.e CT acquisition pelvis lower limb , venous phase opacification ) addition thoracic CT angiography woman suspect postpartum pulmonary embolism ( PE ) result gain venous thromboembolism detection rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computed Tomography CT Venography During Postpartum Venous Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) remain leading cause maternal death postpartum develop country ; Thoracic compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) first-line diagnostic test PE suspicion , 20 35 % rate inconclusiveness pregnancy postpartum , 2 3 time higher general population . CT venography ( CTV ) consist delayed CT acquisition abdomen , pelvis low limb , 3 minute start contrast administration . It use detect deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) , source embolus PEs . The investigator hypothesize postpartum PEs due pelvic vein thrombosis detect pelvic DVT perform systematic CTV could increase overall venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) detection .</detailed_description>
