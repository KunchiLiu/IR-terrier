	<brief_summary>The objective research study conduct pivotal phase 3 trial treatment investigational drug dichloroacetate ( DCA ) young child deficiency pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( PDC ) . PDC deficiency ( PDCD ) common cause congenital lactic acidosis frequently fatal metabolic disease childhood proven treatment exists . The investigator predict DCA represent target potential therapy PDCD ability increase catalytic activity stability enzyme complex . The conclusion numerous laboratory clinical investigation consistent postulate lead designation DCA Orphan Product congenital lactic acidosis Food Drug Administration . A novel Observer report outcome ( ObsRO ) survey complete study participant 's parent/caregiver , efficacy outcome measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical site establish across United States study participation . The investigator conduct randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial 24 child , age 6 month 17 year , confirm diagnosis PDC Deficiency . Study participant complete Screening procedure Visit 1 confirm eligibility study participation . Screening study procedure include medical history review physical exam ; blood urine collection . Study participant complete Baseline study procedure Visit 2 prior randomization treatment . Baseline study procedure include , medical history review physical exam ; blood urine collection ; 3 day food record ; train complete ObsRO daily survey . The ObsRO survey develop study evaluate study participant feel function home setting . The ObsRO survey complete study participant parent/caregiver every day treatment period ( study medication placebo ) study participation ( approximately 9 month ) . During treatment period 1 2 ( 4 month study medication 5 month placebo ) , study participant communicate study team least 2 time per month evaluate child 's level health , compliance daily survey completion take study medication . The study medication ship study participant home month . Study participant complete Visit 3 month 5 complete study assessment clinical site . Visit 3 study procedure include medical history review physical exam ; blood urine collection ; review ObsRO survey completion ; 3 day food record . Study participants complete treatment period sustain serious adverse event attributable DCA , offer continued access investigational medication DCA open-label access program study conclude June 2020 . Study participant must sign separate consent form participation open-label access phase clinical trial must complete study visit every 6 month clinical site study assessment include medical history review physical exam , blood urine collection . The study medication continue mail study participant open-label phase dose receive blinded phase study . Patients stratify accord predict rate DCA metabolism clearance , base genotyping prior randomization . Patients provide whatever diet `` standard care '' deem appropriate expert clinician .</detailed_description>
