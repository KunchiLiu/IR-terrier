	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine relationship foot muscle , foot motion , toe deformity . Results investigation help investigator understand contributes foot deformity role foot muscle development foot deformity . This could potentially guide treatment option focus strengthen foot muscle prevent reduce risk develop foot deformity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long term goal research reduce incidence low extremity amputation people diabetes mellitus peripheral neuropathy . It hypothesize muscle , joint , movement deterioration associate diabetes peripheral neuropathy contribute metatarsophalangeal joint ( MTPJ ) hyperextension deformity . MTPJ deformity result excessive plantar stress insensitive forefoot , lead ulceration amputation . However , specific cause MTPJ deformity clear . The overall goal proposal identify cause MTPJ deformity examine ability target foot specific intervention de-couple diabetes related mechanism MTPJ deformity progression , follow participant 3 year . The investigator hypothesize cause MTPJ deformity interaction accumulation advance glycation end product , muscle deterioration , limited joint mobility compensatory movement strategy . The specific aim determine : 1. relationship advance glycation end product , intrinsic foot muscle volume , limited ankle dorsiflexion joint mobility , MTPJ hyperextension movement pattern , MTPJ alignment ; 2. estimate effect foot specific intervention MTPJ extension alignment 3. determine progression MTPJ deformity predictor progression three year . The follow collected participant diabetes mellitus peripheral neuropathy monitor three year understand cause progression MTPJ deformity : 1 . Skin intrinsic florescence measure advance glycation end product accumulation increase collagen cross-linking associate peripheral neuropathy , limited joint mobility , muscle deterioration . 2 . Magnetic resonance image measure intrinsic foot muscle deterioration precedes extrinsic foot muscle deterioration result distal proximal peripheral neuropathy . The muscle imbalance weak intrinsic foot muscle , muscle able flex MTPJ , presence relatively strong extrinsic toe extensor , result force couple hyperextends MTPJ . 3 . Kinematic compute tomography measurement foot ankle joint position examine mobility movement pattern contribute repeat extreme MTPJ hyperextension daily activity . The investigator believe advanced glycation end product lead limited ankle joint dorsiflexion . As result , increase reliance extensor digitorum longus assist dorsiflexing stiff ankle joint activity like sit stand . This study profound implication reduce risk skin breakdown amputation help understand treat cause acquire neuropathic foot deformity . A successful foot specific intervention improve MTPJ alignment provide non-invasive option halt slow cascade event lead major low extremity amputation , improve function minimize disability .</detailed_description>
