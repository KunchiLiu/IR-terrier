	<brief_summary>Treatment triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) rely heavily different regime chemotherapeutic agent remain one challenging subtypes treat lack specific therapy . Despite sensitive chemotherapy , many woman TNBC relapse quickly , develop locoregional recurrence visceral metastasis . Toxicity chemotherapy resistance still major limitation treatment patient TNBC . Despite current trend target therapy development , cytotoxic agent mainstay treatment patient breast cancer . Further research new combination different compound need order maximise benefit , whilst minimise toxicity . The phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway associate resistance variety anti-tumor agent . This describe pre-clinically cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent vary mechanisms action include taxanes , DNA-damaging agent . In clinic , activate PI3K tumor correlate decreased response therapy bad clinical outcome . The recent biological finding suggest PI3K/mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor may increase efficacy chemotherapeutic agent consider standard care ( SOC ) treatment several solid tumor . The study Unitaed state Oncology Research Huston Sarah Cannon Cancer Center randomize 1830 patient high risk breast cancer standard adjuvant treatment adriamicin cyclophosphamide follow paclitaxel versus experimental adjuvant treatment adriamicin taxotere ( AT ) follow paclitaxel . At 5-years follow , AT follow paclitaxel produce significantly well overall survival ( p=0.054 ) improve disease free survival ( DFS ) ( p=0.19 ) . Among TNBC patient DFS ( 74 % versus 79 % , p=0.1 ) overall survival ( OS ) ( 79 % versus 84 % , p=0.037 ) good experimental arm . However , main reason patient take study treatment toxicity ( 85 patient control arm 128 experimental arm ) consent withdrawal ( 18 patient control arm 30 patient experimental arm ) . For reason , research alternative intensify , thus result discovery development new compound tolerable profile compare paclitaxel . Among total 762 patient enrol Eisai Metastatic Breast Cancer Study Assessing Physician 's Choice Versus E7389 ( EMBRACE ) trial , 19 % TNBC . Of note , eribulin effective hormone receptor-negative patient TNBC patient , 29 % risk reduction . Treatment eribulin well tolerate . Neutropenia , leucopenia , peripheral neuropathy , asthenia/fatigue common adverse event report Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grade 3 4 . Neutropenia common adverse event report CTCAE grade 4 eribulin group ( 24.1 % ) . Based finding date , eribulin attractive agent , role combination new compound everolimus deserves investigation . Their combination might lead profound effect tumor cell biology triple negative metastatic breast cancer . During course trial , dose reduction combination permit patient tolerate start dose</brief_summary>
