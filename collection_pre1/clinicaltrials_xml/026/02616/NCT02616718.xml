	<brief_summary>This prospective multicenter study patient diagnose medium giant incisional hernia ( transverse defect &gt; 7 cm ) . Patients refer surgical outpatient clinic invite participate study . As standard , patient examine incisional hernia undergo CT scan accord hernia protocol , plan surgical repair ( baseline scan ) . After CT scan , patient see out-patient clinic either treat conservatively without surgery , schedule elective surgical repair hernia . If surgery plan , patient participate study undergo additional CT scan hernia protocol , within two week prior surgery ( follow-up scan ) .

	<detailed_description>This prospective multicenter study patient diagnose medium giant incisional hernia ( transverse defect &gt; 7 cm ) . Patients refer surgical outpatient clinic invite participate study . As standard , patient examine incisional hernia undergo CT scan accord hernia protocol , plan surgical repair ( baseline scan ) . After CT scan , patient see out-patient clinic either treat conservatively without surgery , schedule elective surgical repair hernia . If surgery plan , patient participate study undergo additional CT scan hernia protocol , within two week prior surgery ( follow-up scan ) . In case baseline scan hernia protocol exists , patient undergo scan immediately inclusion study . Furthermore , patient ask fill questionnaire physical activity ( IPAQ ) hernia-related quality life ( HerQLes ) time baseline follow-up scan . IPAQ well-validated questionnaire , assess patient ' physical activity within last 7 day . The outcome metabolic minute per week , numerical value place responder one three category : Low , moderate high physical activity . HerQLes validate questionnaire assess hernia-related quality life . This questionnaire translate Danish use standardize protocol . The outcome numerical score 0-100 , 100 high hernia-related quality life . Currently , time plan hernia repair surgery approximately 30 week . Thus , mean time two CT scan around 28-32 week . If conservative non-surgical approach chosen , patient still participate study undergo additional CT scan 28-32 week .</detailed_description>
