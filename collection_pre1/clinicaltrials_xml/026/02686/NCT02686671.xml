	<brief_summary>Shoulder pain common . People receive injection shoulder painful shoulder . However , investigator know patient shoulder pain respond best injection shoulder . Investigators plan use `` Pull Test '' researcher pull arm resist shoulder movement investigate help determine patient good pain relief shoulder injection . The study take place Anchorage , Alaska . There two phase study . For phase , subject complete questionnaire . Phase I `` Reliability Testing '' test consistent two licensed physical therapist give shoulder examination test Pull Test . Phase II `` Pull Test '' comprise shoulder examination finding , include Pull Test , do one shoulder injection perform normal standard care license physician . For Phase I study , 20 patient treated shoulder pain recruit Advanced Physical Therapy . For Phase II study , 100 patient shoulder pain schedule shoulder injection ask investigator wish participate study number 30 subject qualify study . Phase II study include shoulder test 20 minute injection 4- 7-day , well 6-week , phone follow-up . Statistics use analyze data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Pull Test To Determine Responders To Subacromial Injection In Patients With Shoulder Impingement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Subacromial impingement syndrome ( SAIS ) one common cause shoulder pain . The subacromial-subdeltoid ( SAD ) bursa regard common potential shoulder pain generator . Differentiating specific acromio-humeral interval ( AHI ) tissue responsible pain generation challenge specific clinical examination test exists differentiate SAD bursa rotator cuff tendon pain generator . Corticosteroid injection ( CSI ) within AHI mainstay treatment SAD bursitis rotator cuff tendinopathy . No study date examine specific test associate successful responsiveness CSI target SAD bursa AHI subject shoulder pain . Purpose : To investigate ( 1 ) Phase I : reliability shoulder examination test Pull Test ; ( 2 ) Phase II : positive shoulder traction test resistive shoulder abduction , `` Pull Test '' , correlate successful outcome AHI CSI target SAD bursa . Aims : To evaluate : ( 1 ) reliability Pull Test ; ( 2 ) positive Pull Test correlate successful pain satisfaction outcomes immediately following , 4 7 day follow , 6 week follow AHI CSI target SAD bursa subject musculoskeletal shoulder pain ( 3 ) positive Pull Test correlate successful functional outcome 6 week follow AHI CSI target SAD bursa subject musculoskeletal shoulder pain ( 4 ) sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , positive negative predictive value Pull Test identify subject shoulder pain likely successfully respond AHI CSI target SAD bursa Design : Methodological exploratory correlational study . Methods : Phase I ( reliability test ) : A sample convenience 20 subject treat Advanced Physical Therapy Alaska shoulder pain recruit participate . Two license physical therapist test reliability shoulder examination test Pull Test . Phase II ( Pull Test ) : A consecutive sample convenience subject treat physician Advanced Pain Centers Alaska musculoskeletal shoulder pain schedule subacromial CSI part care ask participate study . The study end minimum 30 subject qualify research study . Those subject agree participate evaluate use shoulder clinical examination include resistive shoulder abduction without humeral traction ( Pull Test ) . Functional status measure use Shoulder Pain Disability Index ( SPADI ) . Following CSI , one investigator blind result pre-injection clinical examination administer clinical examination test perform prior AHI CSI record shoulder pain ( NPRS ) subject satisfaction change pain follow CSI . Subjects receive standardize home instruction . A 4- 7-day follow-up phone call determine shoulder pain ( NPRS ) satisfaction 6-week follow-up phone call determine satisfaction subject ' compliance home instruction , shoulder pain ( NPRS ) rest arm elevation , SPADI score subject satisfaction initiate . Statistical Analysis : Reliability test assess use kappa intraclass correlation coefficient . Validity test Pull Test perform determine sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , negative positive predictive value comparison Pull Test outcome pain functional change observe follow administration AHI CSI . Chi-square ( 2x2 contingency table ) odds ratio calculate evaluate outcome Pull Test ( binary : positive versus negative ) correlate successful pain functional outcome change follow AHI CSI ( successful outcome , Yes versus No ) immediately follow , 4- 7-days follow , 6-weeks follow AHI CSI .</detailed_description>
