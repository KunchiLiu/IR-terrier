	<brief_summary>This study multi-center , randomize , unblinded , clinical trial . The objective determine catheter-based atrial fibrillation ( AF ) ablation superior medical treatment patient impaired leave ventricular ( LV ) function diagnose symptomatic AF within past 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catheter Ablation vs. Medical Therapy Congested Hearts With AF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose trial compare two different approve treatment recently diagnose AF : anti-arrhythmic medication AF ablation . The study conduct determine one treatment effective patient AF heart failure . About 220 subject newly diagnose AF hospital United States take part study . Subjects randomize 1:1 fashion either AF catheter ablation anti-arrhythmic medication treatment AF . Both therapy consider Standard Care .</detailed_description>
