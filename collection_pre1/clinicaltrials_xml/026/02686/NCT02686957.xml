The study duration estimate 48 month ( January 2012 March 2016 ) include retrospective part . A sample size 364 woman estimate recurrence fistula plus/minus 2 % margin error ( width confidence interval 4 % ) 95 % confidence interval sufficient estimate rate pregnancy two-sided 95 % confidence interval 10 % precision . The cumulative incidence rate fistula recurrence calculate use Kaplan-Meier method risk factor analysis perform use adjust cox regression . For outcomes pregnancy , Pearson 's Chi Square ( χ2 ) use compare proportion pregnancy outcomes potential predictor logistic regression model use association report risk ratio 95 % confidence interval . Analysis do use STATA version 13 ( STATA Corporation , College Station , TX , USA ) level significance set P &lt; 0.05 .</brief_summary>
