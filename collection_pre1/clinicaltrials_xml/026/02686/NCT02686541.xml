	<brief_summary>The aim study study effect athrectomy follow percutaneous transluminal angioplasty use Paclitaxel coat Drug Eluting Balloon ( DEB ) treat de novo re-stenotic lesion femoral-popliteal artery patient symptomatic peripheral vascular disease Asian population . The intention study effect debulking athrectomy follow application DEBs prevent restenosis , result improved patency rate The study prospectively recruit 8 case treat athrectomy follow DEB . This project pilot investigate effect athrectomy DEB reduce re-stenosis rate . It primer large scale randomize control trial ( RCT ) involve multiple institution demonstrate benefit athrectomy DEB technology treat de novo versus plain balloon angioplasty bail-out stenting , currently commonly use modality treat femoral-popliteal lesion . There study combine effect rotational athrectomy DEBs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient undergo intervention anaesthesia . After common femoral artery sheath access , diagnostic angiogram perform . After pre-arthrectomy Intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) affect arterial segment , patient undergo treatment lesion arthrectomy , follow post-arthrectomy IVUS analysis . Following arthrectomy , affect vessel treat supplementary Ranger Drug Eluting Balloon ( DEB ) . During post-procedure , patient start dual antiplatelets 3 month follow Aspirin life unless contraindicate . Clinical follow-up , duplex ultrasound ( assess re-stenosis ) Ankle Brachial Pressure Index ( ABPI ) perform 1-month , 6-month 12-month post intervention . Assessment symptom , pulse , clinical patency perform visit .</detailed_description>
