	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) central nervous system ( CNS ) autoimmune disorder characterize chronic inflammation , axonal demyelination , neuronal degeneration . The complex pathophysiology MS mediate autoreactive T cell ultimately invade attack CNS traverse blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) , result persistent irreversible axonal damage physical disability . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) metric contribute substantially diagnosis management MS , provide critical information regard disease activity addition serve secondary endpoint measure clinical trial evaluate MS therapy . Traditional MRI technique ( e.g. , contrast enhance [ CE ] T1-weighted imaging , spin-echo [ SE ] T2-weighted image [ T2-WI ] ) proven effective detect presence macroscopic white matter ( WM ) MS lesion limit inability effectively delineate microscopic tissue damage occur normal-appearing white matter ( NAWM ) microscopic macroscopic tissue damage normal-appearing gray matter ( NAGM ) . Furthermore , brain-lesion burden traditional MRI scan correlate modestly clinical disease progression . Thus , need exists use alternative non-conventional MRI technique approach accurately monitor clinical disease activity efficacy disease-modifying therapy . Dimethyl fumarate ( Biogen Idec , Inc , Cambridge , MA , USA ) FDA approve oral treatment relapse MS. One phase II 2 phase III randomize , placebo-controlled double-blinded clinical trial establish dimethyl fumarate significantly reduce relapse rate improve disability along neuroradiologic outcome relative placebo . There grow evidence suggest oxidative stress significant role pathogenesis MS . Therapies reduce oxidative stress , well inflammation , increase interest . Fumaric acid ester know activate anti-oxidative pathway , well modulate inflammatory cascade . Several vivo study show nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) role attenuate proinflammatory stimuli modulation cytokine signal involvement glutathione homeostasis . For example , one animal study , Nrf2-deficient mouse find increased expression proinflammatory mediator , include cyclooxygenase-2 , interleukin ( IL ) -1b , IL-6 tumour necrosis factor-a , compare wild-type mouse . Nrf2 also establish guardian redox homeostasis show critical attenuate oxidative stress . Under oxidative condition , Nrf2 enter accumulates within nucleus cell activate expression battery cytoprotective detoxification gene . A number vitro vivo study consistently demonstrate key role Nrf2 signal pathway protect CNS oxidative stress-related damage . Currently , oral dimethyl fumarate agent appear directly target Nrf2 , induce cleavage kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein `` cap ' n'collar '' homology-associated protein 1 ( Keap1 ) Nrf2 cell cytoplasm . By cleave Keap1-Nrf2 complex , Nrf2 free cross nuclear membrane interact nuclear transcription factor upregulate antioxidant response element . Via mechanism , dimethyl fumarate appear distinct dual mechanism action attenuate oxidative stress well reduce inflammatory response . Dimethyl fumarate show robust effect suppress appearance new CE , T2 hyperintense T1 hypointense lesion along volume . In recent study , dimethyl fumarate also exert potential cytoprotection remyelination , evidence change magnetization transfer ratio . However , dimethyl fumarate effect non-conventional MRI metric , diffusion-tensor imaging ( DTI ) explore .</detailed_description>
