	<brief_summary>The aim study determine whether carnosine supplementation overweight/obese individual improve insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance decrease sub clinical inflammation . The investigator hypothesise carnosine supplementation reduce type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk factor lower chronic low-grade inflammation ( CLI ) , oxidative stress , advance glycation end product ( AGEs ) , advance lipoxidation end product ( ALEs ) . Aim : To determine capacity carnosine supplementation decrease major risk factor type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease identify metabolic pathway involve , specifically : 1 . Reducing diabetes risk ( insulin sensitivity ; secretory function glucose tolerance ) 2 . Improving cardiovascular risk factor ( lipid ; arterial ( aortic ) stiffness ; central blood pressure ( cBP ) ; endothelial function ) . 3 . Decreasing CLI , oxidative stress , AGEs , ALEs , increase detoxification reactive carbonyl specie ( RCSs ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular risk factor include type 2 diabetes underpin major threat globe result heavy health financial burden across healthcare system . Treating type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease expensive often unsatisfactory . Current medication bring unwanted side effect , often merely delay rather prevent type 2 diabetes complication cardiovascular disease . As concern , micro- macrovascular complication type 2 diabetes often start develop actual diagnosis . Diabetes prevention treatment weight loss exercise program difficult costly public health measure , leave tidal wave type 2 diabetes swell even . An alternative urgently need : low-cost safe approach , easy implement population level . Could carnosine alternative ? The evidence suggest carnosine significant metabolic impact present alternative . A naturally occur dipeptide , carnosine already emerge human therapy exercise physiology , heart failure , cataract prevention treatment , neurology , psychiatry . A promising use may derive effect cardiovascular risk factor . Metabolic research , though confine animal study , strongly suggest carnosine supplementation aid prevention treatment obesity , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease - virtue anti-inflammatory , antioxidative , anti-glycating effect . The investigator conduct first pilot data human demonstrate relationship among carnosine , obesity , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia . Put briefly , pilot weighs strongly favour carnosine mean reduce cardiovascular risk human . Too good true ? Apart excellent side-effect profile , carnosine inexpensive seemingly safe ( available over-the-counter food additive ) , make prima facie ideal population use . In set research urgently need - test significant metabolic potential carnosine address major health problem . The investigator propose comprehensive double-blind placebo-controlled human trial investigate effect carnosine supplementation cardiovascular risk factor . If investigator demonstrate role reduce risk factor type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease overweight obese non-diabetic human , public health implication revolutionary , offer world genuine low cost , accessible , intervention curtail advance obesity , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
