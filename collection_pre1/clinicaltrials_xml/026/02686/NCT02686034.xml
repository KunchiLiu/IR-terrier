	<brief_title>RCT Non-Invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation ( nVNS ) With gammaCore® , Acute Treatment Migraine Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Period 1 : 4-week observational run-in period ; stimulation treatment . Subjects use standard care ( SoC ) medication treat migraine attack , accord individual prescription . Period 2 : 4-week randomized/controlled period . After run-in period , subject randomize ( 1:1 ) receive either nVNS device sham device treat 5 migraine attack . Period 3 : 4-week open-label ( active treatment ) period . After randomized period , subject continue open-label period subject receive active gammaCore device treat 5 migraine attack .</detailed_description>
