	<brief_title>Treatment Malignant Ovarian Cancer : Laparoscopy vs Laparotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principle treat early-stage ovarian cancer first stage cancer , determine optimal surgical non-surgical treatment . Ovarian cancer mainly metastasize extensive diffusion surface organs abdominal cavity . Although common ovarian cancer stag method laparotomy , procedure often miss upper abdominal metastasis , especially diaphragm muscle , thus lead inaccurate staging prognostic assessment , insufficient treatment . A laparoscopic approach allow close observation relevant tissue , tissue magnify laparoscopy , facilitate discovery small lesion surface diaphragmatic muscle , liver stomach fundus . Laparoscopes allow lavage wider area abdominal cavity , include hepatic flexure , splenic flexure diaphragmatic muscle ; also improve accuracy peritoneal lavage examination avoid blood contamination . Laparoscopic surgery also accurate stag procedure , potentially reduced complication , bleeding , hospitalization day expense , recovery time compare laparotomy—thus shorten interval surgery initiation postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy . However , although study compare laparoscopy laparotomy ovarian cancer , individual small-sample case report case-control study . A prospective randomized control clinical trial need . This prospective , open , parallel , randomize , control clinical trial , design compare advantage disadvantage laparoscopy laparotomy diagnose treat early malignant ovarian cancer term surgical safety , postoperative survival rate , reoperation rate , postoperative quality life medical cost , provide evidence clinical application laparoscopic surgical stag diagnose treat early malignant ovarian cancer , fill gap evidence laparoscopy versus laparotomy . Endoscopic surgical stag early malignant ovarian cancer accord trend minimal invasion radical treatment tumor . Surgical procedure Laparoscopy : ( 1 ) Pneumoperitoneum establish laparoscopy . Ascites pelvic peritoneal lavage fluid use cytologic examination . ( 2 ) Unilateral bilateral attachment resect , place specimen bag , remove , pathologically examine fast-frozen sample . Alternatively , ovarian artery vein ligate , attachment lesion side resect place specimen bag , tie place right iliac fossa . ( 3 ) The uterus resect removed vagina specimen bag right iliac fossa . ( 4 ) Pelvic para-aortic lymph node resect separately remove vagina . ( 5 ) The great omentum transverse colon resect , together parietal peritoneum paracolic sulcus basin side , receive multiple punch biopsy . ( 6 ) Removal vermiform appendix ; closure vaginal stump vaginal suture laparoscopic suspension ; ( 7 ) wound hemostasis , irrigation , drainage . Laparotomy : Hysterectomy + oophorotomy + high ligation ovarian artery vein + dissection pelvic abdominal aortic lymph node + resection great omentum + resection vermiform appendix . Procedures laparoscopy group . Withdrawal process Criteria withdrawal trial Patients may withdraw trial ( 1 ) researcher consider withdrawal medically necessary , ( 2 ) patient ask withdraw , ( 3 ) patient fix mean contact plan move city follow-up . Withdrawal consent follow-up If patient family agree test follow-up , conduct evaluation . The corresponding data collect , although data previously collect retain , use analysis inform consent . Data archiving , collection monitor Paper-based case report form archive , data convert electronic version professional use double-data entry strategy . To ensure safety patient integrity clinical data , correct inform consent procedure assessment primary end point compliance monitor professional inspector . Inspectors right query key document . Besides site visit , inspector test center keep touch email phone . Security patient ' data Each patient encode separately trial . Case report form save accordance local data protection law . These data strictly confidential . During clinical interview , clinical research associate examine patient-related data ensure correctness completeness , preservation accord legal requirement . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform use Statistical Product Service Solutions ( SPSS ) 18.0 software , normally distribute variable express mean ± standard deviation ; abnormally distribute variable median interquartile range ; categorical variable express number percentage . Continuous variable compare among group use Student 's t-test . Abnormally distribute data compare among group use non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test . Categorical variable compare among group use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test . Repeated measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) perform different time point assessment group . P &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Contact communication Our communication strategy mainly involve patient enrolled trial , consult doctor , family member friend decide whether participate trial .</detailed_description>
