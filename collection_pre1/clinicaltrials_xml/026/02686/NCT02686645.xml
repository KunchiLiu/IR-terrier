	<brief_title>Fecal Microbiota Therapy Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study effect FMT treatment patient recurrent Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) . The investigator plan enrol approximately 5-10 patient per year next 5 year maximum 50 patient . Patients recurrent CDI refer designate Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Infectious Diseases ( ID ) service screen inclusion exclusion primary investigator ( PI ) , sub investigator and/or designate study personnel . Those patient meet criterion offer FMT recipient . An informed consent obtain recipient donor prior proceed study protocol . Demographic information well detail medical history result standard laboratory test collect recipient donor . The donor preferably &lt; 60 year old maximize fecal microbiota . As involve biological sample theoretical risk transmission infectious agent . To minimize risk , donor select preferentially spouse sexual partner . If possible , another relative acquaintance would serve donor identify recipient . In either case , donor screen potentially transmissible infection . This include health screen questionnaire adapt Canadian Blood Services , clinical examination laboratory investigation rule know transmissible infectious disease . The donor complete satisfaction survey . The submitted stool process lab per `` Stool Prep Protocol '' . The route administration retention enema via rectal tube . As treatment emergency investigator option , necessary , store stool future treatment . If sample use discard 90 day another sample obtain still require . Prior treatment recipient also submit sample stool . Along portion donor sample store -80 degree C future molecular test determine diversity microbiota . This may perform later date dependent obtain necessary funding . Recipients follow 6 month post FMT monitor success treatment , adverse reaction , recipient satisfaction quality life assessment . note : laboratory test Clostridium difficile ( CD ) change new test replace cytotoxicity test .</detailed_description>
