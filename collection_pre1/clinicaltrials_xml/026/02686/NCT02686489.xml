	<brief_title>Humidity Therapy Spontaneously Breathing Tracheostomy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , empirical evidence significant superior efficacy particulate water via large volume nebulizer ( LVN ) , provide humidity therapy spontaneously breathe tracheostomy patient molecular water via heat humidifier . Large volume nebulizer commonly use therapy clinical practice tracheostomy patient . However , term optimal modality provide humidification upper-airway bypass , much controversy . Much available literature look comparison heat humidity ( HH ) heat moisture exchanger ( HMEs ) intubate patient crossover study case study . In addition , see overall great outcome HH . Nonetheless , recent study directly compare use HH LVNs humidity therapy spontaneously breathe tracheostomy patient . Although couple past study directly compare two humidity type spontaneously breathe patient bypass upper airway , research conduct follow-up past study . Furthermore , study restrict outcomes arterial oxygenation also limitation due short duration study small sample size . A tracheostomy artificial airway characterize surgically make incision pass anterior neck trachea . A tube place inside hole create incision provide patent airway individual impaired respiratory function breathe . Approximately 100,000 tracheostomy procedure perform annually United States . The burden cost tracheostomy patient United States related duration hospital stay patient major factor contribute resurgence interest management tracheostomy patient . According data Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) , 2009 , average length hospital stay tracheostomy patient 29 day . In 2013 , analysis data patient acute respiratory failure 90 % non-profit academic medical center United States reveal high resource utilization high morbidity rate tracheostomy patient . The analysis also reveal tracheostomy patient acute respiratory failure average , longer intensive care unit stay ( 24.3 day ) non-tracheostomy patient acute respiratory failure ( 6.6 day ) . Mean hospital stay also high tracheostomy patient ( 36.6 day ) non-tracheostomy patient ( 11.3 day ) . Moreover , average , total hospital cost tracheostomy patient $ 285,509 $ 86,118 non-tracheostomy patient . Management tracheostomy complex undertake include many component span several healthcare discipline , include tube stoma care , humidity therapy , communication swallow strategy , emergency management , wean decannulation . In recent year , clinician worldwide demonstrate renew interest management tracheostomy patient due recognition preventable adverse outcome many patient . The United Kingdom 's 2014 report National Confidential Enquiry Patient Outcome Death ( NCEPOD ) care receive tracheostomy patient conclude tracheostomy management suboptimal . Since tracheostomy management complex , multi-disciplinary endeavor , recent research advocate use multidisciplinary tracheostomy team . One notable collective Global Tracheostomy Collaborative ; collaboration consist multidisciplinary team physician , nurse , respiratory therapist , speech therapist , patient work together find best practice improve clinical outcome center tracheostomy care . As part mission , state , `` multidisciplinary care , standardization care , broad staff education , patient family involvement , critical key driver serve continue bring improvement tracheostomy care . '' In effort improve care tracheostomy patient , expert panel convene American Academy Otolaryngology - Head Neck Surgery develop Clinical Consensus Statement management patient . The author consensus statement note current approach tracheostomy care inconsistent among clinician different institution . Consequently , primary goal consensus statement reduce variance clinical practice manage tracheostomy patient , minimize complication . Aspects tracheostomy management address clinical consensus statement include initial tube change , management emergency complication , decannulation protocol , management tube cuff communication device , specific patient caregiver need . With regard humidification , expert panel reach follow consensus : ( ) humidification use immediate postoperative period necessary thereafter , ( ii ) humidification use patient require mechanical ventilation , ( iii ) humidification use patient history thick secretion . Inadequate humidification tracheostomized patient result assortment adverse complication , ultimately negatively impact epithelial integrity airway . This case situations patient breathe cold , dry air deliver gas supply system hospital . According American Association Respiratory Care ( AARC ) clinical practice guideline humidification , adequate humidification requirement upper airway bypass entail humidity output 33-44 mg H2O/L , 100 % relative humidity 34-41°C . Several type device may use clinical set provide humidity therapy . Thus , awareness type humidity therapy provide important understanding principle operation , application , well potential hazard . The use large volume jet nebulizer ( LVNs ) common respiratory care practice modality humidification therapy . These device pneumatically power , deliver cool/bland aerosol use variable oxygen diluter water pass jet nozzle . The aerosol provide LVNs usually unheated , cool bland . Thus , one would expect see complication arise wide use LVNs clinical setting . However , superior efficacy device still remain questionable evident , exist huge inadequacy study humidification spontaneously breathe tracheostomy patient overall tracheostomy care . Heated humidifiers entail use active humidity , use energy water external body ( e.g . wick humidifier passover humidifier ) conditioning inspired gas . Passive heat humidifiers hand , rely body temperature humidity gradient body external environment . One widely use type passive humidifiers heat moisture exchanger ( HME ) , contain condenser element design enhance capture exhaled moisture ( form water vapor ) patient 's breath , transfer release moisture back inspired air next breath . Kuo et al . compare bland aerosol heat humidity spontaneously breathe patient nasal endotracheal tube normal lung find detrimental effect patient 's oxygenation status use heat jet nebulizer short-term use . It interesting note effect improve exchange therapy heat humidity . However , contradictory result observe Rozsasi et , al . tracheal humidity remain high level use particulate aerosol spray ( 300µL H2O/L air 26°C , 90 % relative humidity ) comparison molecular water vapor ( 32µL H2O/L air 32°C , 100 % relative humidity ) . Studies addition compare use heat moisture exchanger ( HMEs ) , type passive humidification , comparison HH mechanically ventilate patient show mixed result regard superior efficacy one . However , recent systematic review find difference adverse clinical event artificial airway occlusion , mortality , pneumonia , respiratory complication HH HME . The goal propose study help bridge knowledge gap regard management patient tracheostomy tubes improve patient care contribute development clinical practice guideline relevant humidity therapy spontaneously breathe tracheostomy patient . Methodology Study Design Population The propose study conduct Rush University Medical Center ( RUMC ) Chicago , Illinois . Using medical center 's electronic medical database ( Epic ) , current list tracheostomy patient acquire accessible population . From patient list , sample fit inclusion exclusion criterion use study sample . Patients intensive care unit ( ICU ) well various acute care floor include study . Participants approach individually request consent participation propose study , cooperation emphasize strictly voluntary . Consecutive sample employed sampling technique include every available tracheostomy patient meet inclusion criterion , order attain result close target population spontaneously breathe tracheostomy patient possible . This robust nonprobability sample strategy since complete accessible population study , chance observe representative subset population increase . Using design prospective randomize control trial ( RCT ) , patient randomly assign either two group : ( A ) humidity therapy aerosol use large volume nebulizer , ( B ) humidity therapy molecular water vapor use heat humidity . A sample size great 100 participant target , propose study intend address small sample size limitation previous study . Furthermore , study period approximately 60 day desire observe long-term outcome may result .</detailed_description>
