	<brief_summary>At time biomarker-substantiated diagnosis give AD patient remain unclear extent disease devastate cognitive ability within next year . This unsatisfying patient attend physician also major problem context clinical trial aim establish new therapeutic agent . In clinical trial critically important foresee precisely possible course disease . The overall aim subproject identify panel CSF biomarkers improve specificity diagnosis ( `` disease marker '' ) , measure disease activity predict AD progression ( `` stage progression marker '' ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Within last year , protein analyse Aβ-species cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) amyloid-imaging use F18-based PET-tracers become part diagnostic repertoire specialize memory clinic allow neurobiological , biomarker-based validation Alzheimer´s disease ( AD ) diagnosis . This lead substantial increase specificity diagnostic procedure . However , problem remain diverse factor , influence disease progression largely unknown , tools diagnosis improve substantially . We identify patient participation long-term clinical follow study . Biomaterial ( CSF , blood ) obtain baseline subject detailed protein analysis . In subset patient , lumbar puncture repeat compare baseline follow CSF . Within study , panel protein , comprise Aβ- Tau-species well inflammation , glial synaptic marker , potentially involved disease progression measure biomaterial baseline follow assessment . Clinical data correlate panel disease progression marker .</detailed_description>
