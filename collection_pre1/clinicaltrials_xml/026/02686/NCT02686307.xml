	<brief_summary>During tachyarrhythmias , central venous pressure increase arterial blood pressure ( BP ) decrease . The result mixed message central nervous system . On one hand , unload arterial baroreceptor result reflex tachycardia increase sympathetic nerve activity ( SNA ) . On hand , increase filling pressure thus activation cardiopulmonary baroreceptor result reflex bradycardia sympathoinhibition . The investigator previously show supraventricular ventricular tachycardia , arterial baroreflex gain ( BRG ) predominate minimal contribution cardiopulmonary BRG . In addition , investigator find arterial BRG directly correlate BP recovery follow tachycardia termination . The role arterial cardiopulmonary BRGs ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) however , remain unknown . Furthermore , role arterial BRG determine 1 ) BP recovery follow VF induction 2 ) frequency ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) /VF event patient undergo implantation implantable cardioverter/defibrillator ( ICD ) remain unknown . Analysis change sinus node cycle length VF induction patient undergo implantation dual chamber triple chamber ICD , provide unique opportunity look autonomic change accompany VF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : This prospective , non-randomized study . The purpose present study 1 ) ass whether change sinus node cycle length VF induction follow ICD implant correlate arterial BRG , 2 ) determine whether change , thus arterial BRG , predict BP recovery post-defibrillation . POSSIBLE BENEFITS : There specific potential benefit subject participate study . Results study greatly improve investigator 's knowledge VF BP control . POSSIBLE RISKS &amp; DISCOMFORTS : The potential risk discomfort associate assessment arterial baroreflex gain . Nitroprusside ( NTP ) infusion may result significant drop blood pressure , heart attack , rhythm disturbance stroke . The risk associate phenylephrine ( PE ) infusion include blood pressure elevation , heart attack , rhythm disturbance stroke . The likelihood small since medication give small , gradual dos close monitor study personnel physician . If significant blood pressure change occur , medication stop immediately . Stopping medication quickly reverse blood pressure change since drug short half-life . Study procedure : Arterial baroreflex gain measurement perform either patient 's bedside electrophysiology laboratory describe . BP monitor use non-invasive arterial tonometer ( Colin , San Antonio , TX ) perform bedside , preexist arterial line perform laboratory . Logistical consideration , timing , would reason perform assessment bedside . The majority study perform laboratory . This procedure take approximately 20 minute . NTP inject peripheral vein bolus infusion start 50mcg increase 50mcg increment . NTP administration stop 20-30mmHg drop systolic diastolic blood pressure elicit . This follow PE administration bolus infusion start 50mcg increase 50mcg increment . PE administration stop increase systolic diastolic BP 10-20 mmHg baseline elicit . If , time drug infusion , systolic blood pressure decrease 90mmHg increase 160mmHg , subject complains discomfort could associate blood pressure change , infusion stop immediately . Specific condition result arterial BRG assess use NTP PE : 1 ) allergy NTP , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &lt; 100 exclude use NTP ; 2 ) hypersensitivity phenylephrine product , narrow angle glaucoma SBP &gt; 140mmHg exclude use PE . Drugs infuse exist venous access . Arterial BRG determine change heart rate ( HR ) /change diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) drug infusion . Following assessment baroreflex gain , ( patient move laboratory assessment perform bedside ) patient undergo schedule procedure . After implantation ICD , VF induction perform assessment defibrillation threshold . During VF episode , change sinus node CL measure store atrial electrogram ( EGM ) implant device record . Specifically , investigator measure average CL last 5 second defibrillation ( VF-SNCL ) compare average sinus node CL 5 second prior VF induction ( Baseline-SNCL ) . In addition , continuous BP monitoring exist arterial line follow defibrillation store onto data record system . BP recovery define difference mean BP 5 second defibrillation compare first 30 second successful defibrillation . Post-shock pacing always set 40bpm VVI mode . The change sinus node CL BP recovery measurement derive first successful VF induction follow successful VF termination . The induction non-sustained VF VT consider ground withdrawal . On hand , failure induce VF consider ground withdrawal . 12 Month Follow-Up : Data gather schedule unscheduled ICD related hospital visit 12 month . All ICD related event monitor record . Appropriate ICD event define event require anti-tachycardia pacing ( ATP ) defibrillation , diagnose 2 independent electrophysiologists ventricular origin .</detailed_description>
