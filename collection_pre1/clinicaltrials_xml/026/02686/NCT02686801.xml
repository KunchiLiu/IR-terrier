	<brief_title>Body Composition Discharge Neurological Development 2 Years Very Preterm Infants ( OPTIPREMA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postnatal growth crucial premature infant could correlate long-term cognitive development . Recent data literature show possible - appropriate nutritional care - reduce initial weight loss ensure growth deficit accumulate less important previously observe . The quantitative objective achieve growth least equivalent fetus ( 12-18 g/kg.day accord postconceptional age ) . Children often grow slowly first 10 day life , accumulate growth deficit compensate secondarily . Therefore , optimum postnatal growth 20 g/kg.day , rather 15 g/kg.day . It also important ass quality growth , particularly fat free mass . The objective nutritional care dual : sufficient weight gain ( close fetal growth rate ) also relevant body composition . However , little data body composition premature baby discharge . It possible measure quickly ( one minute ) , simply noninvasively use pediatric air-displacement plethysmography . Previous study use complex search technique implement ( dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ) show excessive body fat discharge premature baby . Reference value collect use pediatric air-displacement plethysmography publish 2011 . Nutritional practice strategy significantly evolve past year support objective : improvement early parenteral nutrient intake , new fortifiers human milk , new preterm formula early begin enteral nutrition . Individualized fortification human milk help provide preterm infant sufficient amount nutrient . The modern nutritionnal care preterm infant result earlier high protein energy intake previously perform . It improve anthropometric parameter little know body composition discharge . Furthermore , exposition high nutrient intake could lead metabolic hormonal imprinting increase risk diabetes cardio-vascular disease adulthood . OPTIPREMA aim focus link nutrient intake hospitalization , body composition discharge relationship fat free mass variation discharge neurodevelopment 2 year .</detailed_description>
