	<detailed_description>Compromised cognitive functioning core feature schizophrenia , yet remain major unmet need treatment schizophrenia . Current available therapeutic approach enhance cognition schizophrenia - either pharmacological non-pharmacological ( review ) yield , best , modest result questionable retention cognitive benefit generalization effect functional benefit . The investigator propose novel approach enhance cognition schizophrenia : combining food supplement cognitive training , rather use intervention alone . Aim test primary hypothesis combination L-carnosine cognitive training significantly increase performance patient schizophrenia memory learn train task compare pair cognitive training placebo . The investigator also test secondary hypothesis group receive L-carnosine increased performance due great learn rate . Carnosine antioxidant antiglycating action find food human body . The investigator 's choice guide several consideration , primarily evidence L-carnosine neuroprotective effect antioxidant feature . Briefly , investigator propose alteration metabolism several neurotransmitter system ( particularly glutamate ) contribute , modify , oxidative stress , therefore antioxidant administration could positively affect neurotransmitter role synaptic plasticity , learn memory . Carnosine show improvement cognitive outcome autism ( Chez et al , 2002 ) schizophrenia ( Chengappa et al ; unpublished ) . Chez use oral dos 800mg/d 8 week ; latter study use oral dos 2000mg 4 week show positive effect . Hence dose delivery route use . The investigator opt 4 week course follow broadly two study . Carnosine widely available health food supplement shop UK US retail market highly pure form ; naturally occur food human body ; well-tolerated benign side-effect profile , show previous trial , therefore associated potential risk .</detailed_description>
