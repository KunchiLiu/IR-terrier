	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis bright light help improve behavior sleep patient Alzheimer 's disease agitation type behavior disorder . This hypothesis build notion morning exposure bright light reduce synchronization circadian rhythm observe patient disease , preliminary study data low number support hypothesis . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : To study effect treatment bright light improve patient behavior disorder Alzheimer 's disease , include effect agitation / aggression ( score obtain item agitation / aggression NPI scale-nurse ) . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) To study effect treatment bright light improve patient behavior disorder Alzheimer 's disease , include effect sleep disorder ( score obtain item nocturnal sleep-behavior NPI -nurse , scale score Cohen-Mansfield ) ; ( 2 ) To study effect treatment bright light treatment cognitive function patient Alzheimer 's disease ( MMSE score scale ) . ( 3 ) To examine interest wrist actigraphy ass motor behavior sleep Alzheimer 's disease . RESEARCH DESIGN The primary endpoint change time score obtained item agitation / aggression NPI-nurse level . The secondary endpoint : - Change time score item-night sleep behavior NPI-nurse - Change time Cohen-Mansfield scale - Evolution time total sleep time determine wrist actigraphy - Changes time number episode nocturnal restlessness determine wrist actigraphy - Analysis data wrist actigraphy group without interference - Change time scale score MMSE METHODS Non-pharmacological intervention , randomize , open , multicenter , parallel group ( intervention group control group ) . The total duration research 24 month . The study conduct among hospital geriatric participant . Each center equip room make light therapy : installing ceiling , provision furniture complete procedure . The participation subject include search include visit inclusion 5 visit space one week ass behavior , sleep vis-à-vis tolerance exposure bright light . Variables record : Some variable concern inclusion criterion description patient measure baseline demographic , Alzheimer criterion NINCDS ADRDA , severity dementia , scale Observation-based nocturnal Sleep Inventory ( ONSI ) Negative screen sleep apnea , MMSE . The assessment behavioral disorder Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI-nurse ) Cohen-Mansfield scale perform initiation treatment ( end S0 ) end S2 end S4 ) . Sleep duration amplitude motor activity assess wrist actigraphy . Tthe wrist actigraphy experience significant development assessment sleep . Periods wakefulness / sleep , study use actimeter Vivago device ( STI International ) form wristwatch worn wrist non-dominant person contains accelerometer . The activity meter measure record full range motion achieve 60 consecutive second transmits measure value every minute radio frequency base connect computer record real-time value . A computer application detect good reliability sleep period base analysis movement amplitude validated laboratory study healthy people age . This device also use study circadian rhythm patient dementia non-dementia nursing home , seem quite usable demented patient . This system collect total sleep time , period revival / night activity . For con , use device record quantify motor agitation new approach never develop know . This exploratory approach require several experimental treatment data identify relevant parameter context analysis range motion . Schematically , study focus amplitude schedule movement , also frequency movement exceed certain threshold amplitude . Finally , variation test inter-individual difference study particular . Treatment compliance bright light assess presence occupational therapy session actual duration patient 's presence exposure bright light record session . This study require laboratory test imaging study . Randomization centralize organize Pitie-Salpetriere URC-Charles Foix . Randomization stratify center . For center , patient assign randomization number randoweb® therefore treatment , consider eligible study . The randomization balance block within center . Detailed description use device Intervention group In intervention group , organize occupational therapy session program group 6 bright light administer . These session take place 5 time week 4 consecutive week . They organize late morning ( 10h30 - 12h ) duration 1:30 , lead teacher specially recruit project . Each session last 1h30 conducted room prepare purpose . It include three ceiling light therapy Elecolight® QUEBEC ( include 10,000 lux lamp ) place center rectangular table 6 seat , 50/60 cm ( central device ) 80 cm ( side central device ) table plane . So patient sit around table make occupational therapy activity receive bright light . The arrangement ensure lamp distance 60-80 cm face patient . The light output power area patient sit measure light meter check adequacy provision . This arrangement allow patient receive illumination `` green '' requirement achieve group activity . The occupational therapy activity choose perform table : drawing , domino , card , etc ... Given particularities patient study ( patient Alzheimer 's disease behavioral problem ) , mode administration seem preferable conventional method ( patient sit still front light box ) , would likely encumber high failure rate patient . Control group Patients control group benefit occupational therapy session program group intervention group , except light condition normal condition , say intensity 50 lux . They conduct specially recruit project educator comparable local , early afternoon week intervention group . Indeed , control group 's program begin time intervention group . The nature occupational therapy session offer patient group similar make session intervention group . This point seem important allows certain degree adjustment environment intervention control , minimize management difference , patient benefit group session usual care . Expected duration participation people , description time duration period research The duration patient 's participation research 5 week : S0 , S1 , S2 , S3 S4 . The tour designate follow : V0 : evaluation end first week without treatment ( S0 ) ; V1 : end first week treatment ( Week 1 ) ; V2 , V3 , V4 , end correspond week treatment ( Week 2 Week 4 ) . Each patient 6 visit . Their timing content : The first phase screen include seek eligibility criterion patient information relatives present information note . The first visit Vi inclusion visit : obtaining consent ; The doctor sign consent . The 5 visit : - V0 : Initial evaluation behavior assessment , - Then 4 visit ( V1 V4 ) weekly treatment ( performed end treatment week ) : V1 , V2 , V3 , V4 : search adverse event ; V2 , V4 : behavioral assessment psychologist ; V4 : collection end study information . The behavioral assessment psychologist make initially ( V0 ) V2 V4 visit ( VF stop end study ) , employ specific rating scale include NPI -nurse scale Cohen-Mansfield , practice context assumption usual care . The patient 's cognitive function control check inclusion criterion , also re-evaluated use MMSE scale visit . The doctor perform recruit first time screen patient , assessment behavior disorder sleep , within framework define criterion inclusion non-inclusion study .
