	<detailed_description>Gait-related dual-task impairment common problem experienced people stroke walk slowly take short step dual-task walking . Decrements dual-task capacity may predispose stroke survivor risk fall affect negatively functional independence quality life . Currently need explore whether people stroke practice dual-tasking stand walk lead enhance dual-task performance reduce fall rate . However , lack prospective , controlled study quantify balance , gait , cognition , fall-risk dual-task training . The objective study investigate effect dual-task training impairment , disability , participation level stroke survivor investigate possible factor affect cognitive-motor interference ( CMI ) dual-task condition . Specifically , compare immediate retention effect dual-task balance train single-task balance training CMI , balance confidence , fall rate , functional performance , quality life individual stroke ( Aim 1 ) . The second aim study explore lateralization , stroke chronicity , task type , task difficulty may influence pattern CMI ( Aim 2 ) . The third aim study investigate whether dual-task balance assessment sensitive single-balance assessment distinguish stroke faller stroke non-fallers ( Aim 3 ) . A prospective randomize control trial conduct 2 medical center study . Forty-eight people stroke randomly allocate either single- dual-task balance training group . Both group receive 12 hour train 4 week progressively increase task difficulty ( 60 minute per session , three time week , four week ) . The single-task training group undertake balance training gait training . The dual-task training group train set balance activity single-task training simultaneously perform variety add cognitive motor task instruction variable priority . During session , participant dual-task training practice shift attention task spend half train attention focus balance task , half focus secondary cognitive motor task . A blinded assessor conduct three assessment baseline , post intervention , 1-month follow-up . At baseline , participant examine balance , gait , cognitive performance single-task ( standing/walking prefer speed fast speed , cognitive task ) dual-task condition ( standing/walking prefer speed fast speed concurrent cognitive task ) . Three cognitive task ( simple auditory reaction time task , count backward 3 task , Stroop task ) use examine pattern CMI task represent different domain cognitive function ( information processing speed , work memory , executive function ) . The primary outcome measure cognition composite score accuracy reaction time . The primary outcome measure balance sway index mCTSIB test BioSway balance system single- dual-task standing . The primary outcome measure gait gait speed 10 walk test single- dual-task walking . Secondary outcome measure include : Berg Balance Scale , Timed Up Go test single- dual-task condition , Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale , Fugl-Meyer Assessment , Functional Independence Measure , Nottingham Extended Activities Daily Living Scale , Stroke Impact Scale . Additionally , fall prospectively monitor monthly record follow 6 month train . Repeated measure ANOVA use compare measurement baseline , training , follow-up group .</detailed_description>
