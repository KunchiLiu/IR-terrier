	<detailed_description>Feeding optimization nutritional assessment patient severe heart failure challenge . The reason rather complex many question answer yet . Unfortunately , clear definitive guideline available big Nutritional Societies - The European Society Clinical Nutrition Metabolism ( ESPEN ) , American Society Parenteral Enteral Nutrition ( ASPEN ) , British Association Parenteral Enteral Nutrition ( BAPEN ) , Society Critical Care Medicine ( SCCM ) , Canadian Clinical Care Guidelines . However , heat debate Nutritional Conferences need `` Heart Failure feeding-guidelines '' urge . Though local international comprehensive proposal highly demand unfortunately suggestion still miss . As mentioned lot reason nutritional insufficiency persists . Probably one reason `` split '' medical profession hence create proper guideline entail many problem reveal unsought difficulty lack knowledge . The nutrition ( esp . TPN ) primarily carry anaesthetist less extent manner gastroenterologist . Feeding performed surgeon , internist , paediatrician etc . minimal . Cardiologists play important role field nutrition . Cardiac patient lose weight easily cardiac cachexia usually perceive cardiologist . The best conceivable compensation heart failure prerequisite `` nutritional appropriateness '' severe case compensation do cardiologist . Without compensation consequently insufficient cardiac output , `` refeeding '' seem impossible . Cardia cachexia absolute contraindication Heart Transplantation ( HTX ) Ventricular Assist Device/Total Artificial Heart ( VAD/TAH ) implantation . These patient usually young 65 year-of-age , expect quality life ( QoL ) transplant heart good accord international data rate survival acceptable . Moreover , well know phenomenon prevention cardiac cachexia much easy treatment . Sadly , use know nutritional score system - Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool ( MUST ) , Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire ( SNAQ ) , Nutritional Risk screening ( NRS2002 ) , Malnutrition Screening Tool ( MST ) , Subjective Global Assessment ( SGA ) , Mini Nutritional Assessment ( MNA ) - work well situation , limit value might use patient group . We must emphasize fact increase number patient suffer end-stage heart disease ( ESHD ) expect specialization within cardiology make problem pronounce . Without proper compensation appropriate nutrition often impossible well cardiac compensation unsuccessful without proper feeding . The exist recommendation tradition gastroenterology surgery different hence seem sensible formentioned fact may contribute lack proper guideline . We believe elimination cardiac cachexia feasible special care suitable unit . In 2014 ICU patient , previously eligible HTX cachexia , treat accord `` protocol '' reach minimum desired weight transplant . The postoperative care recuperation similar suffer cachexia . These result also similar find literature . According experience cardiac cachexia seem manageable . In case proper nutrition , international cost-benefit analysis show positive result regard patient ` recovery : le infection severe sepsis , decrease number in-hospital stay , good wound heal less ventilatory ICU day . Summing would like draw attention unsolved problem exists Hungary world . The solution problem urgent seem possible . We think overcome severe condition change system , need new guideline , need education need research . The definition cardiac cachexia weight loss 6 % least 6 month . The incidence CHF patient NYHA class III/IV approximately 10 % per year . Chronic heart failure patient cardiac cachexia mortality two three time higher noncachectic patient . The prevalence cardiac cachexia may underestimated simple measurement body weight body mass index many patient show relative reduction muscle mass despite normal overall weight . Body composition measurement essential chronic heart failure patient estimate sarcopenia . These method determine different component whole body weight . To estimate sarcopenia essential measure fat-free mass ( FFM ) . According literature dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) gold standard procedure determine body composition FFM . The use DXA limit chronic heart failure patient due low availability relatively high cost . Bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) non-invasive , relatively low cost , bedside body composition measurement method . With radiation exposure repeat multiple time . Hypothesis : The BIA method already validate healthy patient different disease group . We suppose use reliable data obtain chronic heart failure patient population . Objectives aim : Bioelectrical impedance analysis approve extreme body mass index body fluid range . These condition however may present chronic heart failure patient . Thus essential validate BIA gold standard DXA method primary aim . Patients admit Gottsegen Gy√∂rgy Hungarian Institute Cardiology acute decompensation chronic heart failure enrol prospective study . Enrolled participant undergo body composition measurement dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( Hologic , Delphi QDR ) bioelectrical impedance analysis ( Bodystat , Quadscan 4000 ) method . The main measure parameter - body weight , total body water , fat mass , fat-free mass ( lean weight ) , extracellular mass , body cell mass , resistance , reactance , phase angle , basal metabolic rate - registered database . Statistical analysis data acquire different method perform validate BIA . Primary aim : 1 . Verify bioelectrical impedance analysis safely perform chronic heart failure patient . 2 . Compare body composition value measure BIA DXA . Validate use BIA chronic heart failure patient population . Secondary aim : To examine relationship sarcopenia alter body composition value parameter chronic heart failure ( NYHA functional class , biomarkers , echocardiographic value , hand grip test ) . Expected result : Body composition value measure bioelectric impedance analysis correlate DXA value . These result validate use BIA chronic heart failure patient .</detailed_description>
