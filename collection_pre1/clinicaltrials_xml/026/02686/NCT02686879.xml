Hyperopia know risk factor amblyopia , ( lazy eye ) , may occur result squint ( turn ) , due different level hyperopia eye ( anisohyperopia ) . Hyperopia anisohyperopia often persist adulthood result impairment binocular vision . Current management involve prescribe spectacle contact lens correct hyperopia eye , usually lifelong intervention . In recent year great deal interest delay progression myopia ( short-sightedness ) slow growth eye use particular type contact lens term centre-distance multifocal design . There encouraging result area date . The propose study would explore use centre-near multifocal design contact lenses encourage growth eye , thereby reduce hyperopia . There three element programme research : 1 . The natural progression axial growth refractive error measure hyperopic anisohyperopic subject age 5 19 .

	<brief_title>Effect Peripheral Defocus Axial Growth Hyperopes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , hyperopia receives much less research attention myopia even though impact moderate high level hyperopia especially one eye ( anisohyperopia ) lead amblyopia correct fully young age . Hyperopia occur consequence insufficient ocular growth failure emmetropise ( reach expect normal level ) childhood majority hyperopic refractive error result eye short refractive power . In anisohyperopia unclear one eye may remain hyperopic fellow eye grow towards emmetropic state . Studies animal suggest manipulate peripheral defocus optical mean simultaneously provide correct axial focus either discourage encourage axial growth effectively treat myopia hyperopia respectively . Recent research establish progression myopia axial growth significantly reduce child adolescent use bifocal multifocal contact lens . The optometrist central role clinical management refractive error child application future modality may modify development ametropia . The following proposal , therefore , present programme work relevant optometrist novel hyperopia research . By combine assessment ocular biometry , monitor normal growth rate , intervention study use bifocal contact lenses child first provide new data whether human eye stimulate grow response specific type defocus . Consequently research offer new perspective management hyperopia anisohyperopia . The finding offer potential new approach towards amblyopia treatment child insight strategy optimal correction encourage axial growth hyperopia . There three element propose programme research : - Refractive error axial growth follow three year period hyperopic anisohyperopic subject age 5 19 year old gain understanding natural progression parameter specify cohort - Simultaneous vision bifocal/mulitfocal soft contact lens use encourage axial growth hyperopic child adolescents axial hyperopia effort reduce hyperopia . The bifocal centre near design contact lenses prescribed provide clear central vision distance near thus expose retina peripheral hyperopic defocus distance zone - This concept also apply anisometropes represent unique example ocular development , two eye individual , identical genetic background seemingly subject identical environmental influence , grow asymmetrically produce significantly different refractive error . This correction manipulation strategy potential apply hyperopic eye encourage eye growth reduction hyperopia associate benefit improve binocular vision stereopsis . For natural progression study healthy hyperopic child adolescent age 5 19 year age recruit via researcher 's optometry practice Aston University optometry clinic . The growth visual characteristic eye follow time without intervention research team . Following consent , initial visit , participant undergo number visual assessment include measurement axial length eye , focus ability range distance , eye muscle balance , vision range different contrast , pupil size quality stereovision objective assessment crystalline lens parameter . Measures participant 's spectacle prescription objective subjective mean also undertake follow instillation eye drop relax muscle eye dilate pupil . The eye drop take around 40 minute work pupils return normal size approximately 24 hour . The majority assessments similar undertaken routine eye examination . The height subject also take baseline six monthly interval throughout study . Parents child also ask complete background questionnaire visit . The first visit expect last around 90 minute . Participants review every six month period three year measure take baseline repeat . Instillation eye drop dilate pupil relax eye muscle use alternate visit . For intervention study , initial visit participant undergo number visual assessment include measurement shape length eye , focus ability range distance , eye muscle balance , vision range different contrast , pupil size quality stereovision . Measures participant 's spectacle prescription objective subjective mean also undertake follow instillation eye drop relax muscle eye dilate pupil . Subjects intervention group reassess period six month establish measure natural eye growth prior fit contact lens . Parents child also ask complete background questionnaire visit . The first visit expect last around 90 minute . The second visit intervention group assess individual 's suitability contact lens wear use microscope . The participant parent instruct insert , remove care contact lenses . The fitting contact lenses level vision assess . For anisohyperopes , hyperopic eye fit commercially available soft multifocal contact lens less hyperopic eye fit soft single vision contact lens . Subjects similar level hyperopia eye fit commercially available soft multifocal contact lenses eye . The participant issue supply contact lenses along commercially produce instruction guide care contact lens . The second visit expect last around 90 minute . The child may need attend unscheduled visit problem arise early stage contact lens wear . Otherwise review one two week dispense visit also one month later routine contact lens aftercare appointment . Participants intervention group review 6 , 12 , 18 24 month dispense visit . During visit majority measurement undertaken initial assessment repeat along routine contact lens aftercare . Eye drop relax eye muscle dilate pupil instill 12 24 month visit . For anisohyperopic subject , level hyperopia hyperopic eye reduces level match less hyperopic eye intervention stop . For non-anisohyperopic subject , intervention stop refractive error reach mean spherical error +0.50D . At end intervention period 24 month participant assess period 6 month assess growth eye post-intervention .</detailed_description>
