	<detailed_description>Low Vitamin D3 ( VD3 ) level report associate risk allergic disease like asthma . In addition , VD3 demonstrate vitro , ex vivo ( skin-explants ) animal model program immune system towards anti-inflammatory immune response , dominate regulatory T-cells ( Treg ) produce Interleukin ( IL ) -10 . In response allergen , healthy individual default protective immune response innocuous allergen , whereas allergic subject develop inflammatory Th2-type response . VD3 co-administered allergen may promise adjuvant improve onset efficacy allergen immunotherapy ( AIT ) , help allergic immune system divert towards allergen-specific response dominate regulatory T cell ( Treg ) IL-10 . A clinical trial perform compare immune effect , tolerability safety multiple dos VD3 analogue ( Zemplar® 5 μg/ml - Abbvie , register intravenous route ) administer subcutaneous ( s.c. ) route subject allergic rhinitis healthy control . Primary secondary outcome compare baseline several time point study investigate whether 1 ) healthy control baseline anti-inflammatory systemic cellular immune response polyclonal stimulus allergen compare birch pollen allergic subject , 2 ) whether s.c.VD3 analogue skew responses allergic subject towards profile resemble one observe healthy control . The overall aim provide additional ( vivo ) support use VD3 adjuvant allergen-specific immunotherapy , top exist pre-clinical evidence demonstrate antigen-presenting cell educate adaptive immune system towards anti-inflammatory response allergen see presence VD3 .</detailed_description>
