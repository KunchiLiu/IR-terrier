	<detailed_description>Study design This prospective , observational , multicenter , population-based incidence cohort study enroll case IBD ( CD , UC , indeterminate colitis ) diagnose adult 1 year Spain . In addition , incident case give his/her informed consent , follow 12 month determine change phenotype disease location , need immunosuppressive biologic treatment , need hospital admission surgery first year diagnosis . Study population Incident case diagnose IBD 12 month Spanish territory , population 46,439,864 inhabitant ( 1 January 2015 ) accord data National Statistics Institute ( INE ) . According recent data , 3 % incident case diagnose pediatric population , study focus adult patient ( 15 year age ) . Case detection In Spain , health care perform mostly public health service . According recent data , approximately 15 % Spanish population private health insurance ( Informe Sanidad Privada : Aportando Valor . Análisis de situación 2014 ( Report Private Health Care : Providing Value . 2014 Situation Analysis ) ; available : http : //www.fundacionidis.com/wp-content/informes/informe_analisis situac_2014_0.pdf ) . In addition , person private health insurance , 15 % make exclusive use . For reason take account specific characteristic IBD , risk underestimate incidence IBD consider case see public health center would little relevance . Therefore , study conduct center provide public health care within National Health System . Furthermore , previously mention , accord recent data 3 % incident case diagnose pediatric population , study focus adult patient ( 16 year age ) 4 . To conduct research project , IBD specialist member GETECCU select Autonomous Community , act coordinator region . Gastroenterologists charge IBD Units Spain contact , unavailable , gastroenterologist hospital include National Catalog Hospitals 31 December 2014 http : //www.msssi.gob.es/ciudadanos/prestaciones/centrosServiciosSNS/hospitales/ home.htm ( last access 13 August 2015 ) . The appropriate strategy identification case plan case case basis Autonomous Community , accord specific characteristic Community , province health area , aim detect incident case . The database endoscopy unit pathology department review site participate study year enrollment , order detect possible incident case IBD might identify initially . Each participate investigator confirm diagnosis time enter patient study 3 month later assure diagnosis phenotypic characteristic disease , thereby great diagnostic accuracy . External monitoring incident case include registry also perform review case select random research team Hospital Universitario de la Princesa . Health area detection enrollment incident case finally assure exclude study . Definitions - Disease location phenotype : IBD location phenotype define accord Montreal classification . - Time diagnosis : It define time first medical consultation make patient onset symptom diagnosis IBD . - Population center : The type population center patient 's birth diagnosis IBD record . Whether population center origin patient consider rural urban base classification National Statistics Institute ( INE ) municipality . - Socioeconomic level : Socioeconomic level assess different variable , patient 's educational level ( primary education lower , secondary education , high education equivalent ) , occupational status ( self-employed , employee , unemployed , retired ) , professional status ( nonsalaried salaried ) type work hour ( full time part time ) . - Number cohabitants : The number cohabitants patient 's home childhood ( 16 year ) diagnosis IBD record . - Smoking : Smoking status categorize `` nonsmoker '' , `` smoker '' , `` ex-smoker '' , consider time diagnosis IBD . Patients consider `` smoker '' smoke 7 cigarette per week least 6 month smoke least 1 cigarette 6 month prior diagnosis . Patients consider `` ex-smokers '' l quit smoke least 6 month diagnosis . Patients consider `` nonsmoker '' never smoke small amount occasionally . - Treatments : Treatments receive patient 12 month since diagnosis disease include , provide receive IBD . Only first prescription therapeutic group record . - Changes phenotype : Changes phenotype consider appearance new lesion present diagnosis subsequent initial test perform determine disease extent severity . In case , phenotype , complication lead classification patient different phenotype date occurrence complication record . - Hospital admission Hospital admission occur first year diagnosis disease include . The date admission , date discharge , related IBD cause admission . - Surgical procedure : The surgical procedure perform patient since diagnosis IBD ( include perform knowing patient IBD lead diagnosis ) , indication surgery date surgery record . An emergency surgical procedure consider surgery perform within 24 admission patient emergency department . An elective surgical procedure consider procedure perform subsequent first day admission usual surgical team . Data collection follow-up : Demographic data ( age , sex , smoke ) , family history IBD , socioeconomic characteristic , IBD type , pattern , location presence extraintestinal manifestation diagnosis collect patient . The occurrence complication ( fistula , stenosis , abscess ) , change disease location , treatment IBD , surgeries IBD , hospital admission first year since diagnosis also record . After patient include , two visit record 12 month , coincide routine visit patient follow-up his/her disease . Thus , course study , 3 visit record , describe : - Visit 0 ( baseline ) : inclusion patient study collection socioeconomic data diagnosis IBD . - Visit 1 ( month 3 ) : confirmation IBD diagnosis update data related treatment , change phenotype , hospital admission , surgery . - Visit 2 ( month 12 ) : confirmation IBD diagnosis update data related treatment , change phenotype , hospital admission , surgery . End study . In case patient include time diagnosis later refer center , correspond visit perform retrospectively , complete data retrospectively visit ( previous one ) . In addition , inclusion period extend 6 month patient diagnose year study belong participate area previously identify responsible investigator may enrol . In case site participate ENEIDA , avoid duplication record data responsible physician , possibility modify database propose ENEIDA committee , include , way visible investigator research project , necessary variable include ENEIDA . In event modification accept ENEIDA committee , study data record electronic database create specifically purpose . In case , sit currently participate ENEIDA record data electronic database REDCap create purpose . Subsequently , two database , ENEIDA create specifically study , export combined analysis . Statistical analysis The reference population study make reference population area public center participate study physician work , base estimate National Statistics Institute ( INE ) . The incidence rate ( number incident case per 100,000 inhabitant ) 1 year calculate . Age-standardized incidence rate adjust European population calculated6 . For qualitative variable , percentage calculate ( 95 % confidence interval ) quantitative variable , arithmetic mean standard deviation determine . In univariate analysis , categorical variable compare use Chi-squared ( X2 ) test quantitative variable compare use appropriate test ( Student 's t-test , Wilcoxon , etc . depend whether value follow normal distribution ) . To examine detail time course use treatment , hospital admission , surgery occurrence complication , Kaplan-Meier method use , differences curve compare log-rank test . A Cox regression model use study variable associate probability occurrence complication , progression severe phenotype , use immunosuppressive biologic drug , hospital admission , performance surgery .</detailed_description>
