	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy widely consider main choice patient suspect colorectal disease , screen high risk colorectal cancer . However， colonoscope examination , especially usedated one screen , may bring much pain patient , even induce severe complication peforation.Considering increase need colonoscopy examination screen purpose , problem deserve futher study reduce pain ensure safety procedure.Some study suggest use Magnetic endoscopic imaging ( MEI ) colonoscopy potential ease patient discomfort reduce complications.Theoretically , MEI could accurately depict position scope three dimension help avoid forcefully feed colonoscope loop vulnerable bowel , thus alleviate patient pain promote procedure safety.However , problem whether MEI system could help reduce patient pain procedure effectively，especially inexperienced colonoscopists，still remain controversial reseachers , study design test hypothesis MEI may help decrease risk complication , colon perforation.In study aim evaluate efficacy magnetic scope navigation patient pain ussedated colonoscopy；In addition，we try construct simple colon force measurement device , use device observe variation force exert colon loop , expect find potential mechanism pain-alleviation explore possible effect complication reduction colonoscopy influence MEI system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Magnetic Endoscopic Imaging Patient Pain During Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial plan two part : In first part , consecutive patient would recruit randomized colonoscopy examination perform inexperienced colonoscopists ( perform less 200 procedure ) either without asssistance magnetic scope navigation system . The second part would conduct pilot study , would first construct simple colon force measurement device ; colonoscopist would randomize perform colonoscopy colon model either without MEI view force measurement device use collect data colon force variation meanwhile . All force variation data would record image storage device.No patient would involve second part.In pilot study , plan perform 40 colonoscopy procedure assistment MEI 40 colonoscopy procedure without assistment MEI .</detailed_description>
