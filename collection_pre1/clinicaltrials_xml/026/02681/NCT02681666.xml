	<detailed_description>This study support finding Irritable Bowel Syndrome patient alteration hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal stress axis cortisol level elevate . Stress-induced release corticotropin-releasing factor alters gastric digestion gastrointestinal motility . Furthermore , stress contribute factor immune activation low-grade inflammation observe Irritable Bowel Syndrome overall physical psychological distress correlate percentage activate natural killer T cell . In addition , brain-gut axis propose mechanism Irritable Bowel Syndrome due dysregulated enteric nervous system central nervous system event . The central nervous system may perceive visceral stimulus gut mucosa inflammation injury cause afferent nerve sensitization . Regardless specific pathophysiologic basis Irritable Bowel Syndrome , current aim treatment improve quality life , treatment include dietary alteration psychological therapy cognitive behavioral therapy aid symptomatic relief . The common dietary intervention patient Irritable Bowel Syndrome fermentable oligosaccharide , disaccharide , monosaccharide polyol restrict diet . However , adherence diet difficult patient Irritable Bowel Syndrome fail continue eliminate food lead bloat pain . Various psychological therapy implement past successful cognitive behavioral therapy . The beneficial result incorporate mindfulness-based intervention improve myriad health-related problem , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , anxiety disorder , psychological distress , quality life , depression fibromyalgia , diabetes , eat disorder grow considerably recent past .

The investigator develop 12 week Mindfulness-Based Irritable Bowel Syndrome Eating Awareness Training inspire relevant piece Mindfulness Based Eating Awareness Training program . Mindfulness base intervention integrate moment moment awareness bodily sensation , observation , thought , feeling suspend judgment self . Successful Irritable Bowel Syndrome treatment modality elusive , strong food stress-reactive association make medical condition ideal mindfulness treatment intervention . The usual diet Irritable Bowel Syndrome elimination diet fermentable carbohydrate ( vary sugar length ) polyols ( sugar alcohols stone fruit ) call Fermentable Oligosaccharides , Disaccharides , Monosaccharides Polyols elimination diet . Patients Irritable Bowel Syndrome follow Fermentable Oligosaccharides , Disaccharides , Monosaccharides Polyols diet receive suboptimal nutrient intake long time period attempt discern food group digestible others intolerable , mixed finding improvement quality life , stress-related measure . After eligibility establish , write informed consent obtain randomization conduct place participant either mindfulness-based Irritable Bowel Syndrome- eat awareness train group Fermentable Oligosaccharides , Disaccharides , Monosaccharides Polyols group pre-baseline test perform group . Two-four week later participant receive baseline test first session arm study . Four week later , participant study arm receive follow assessment testing . Directly follow eight week intervention Fermentable Oligosaccharides , Disaccharides , Monosaccharides Polyols arm , participant receive post-intervention test 1 . At 2 4 week follow intervention Fermentable Oligosaccharides , Disaccharides , Monosaccharides Polyols FODMAPs ) arm , post-intervention test 2 post-intervention test 3 take place , respectively total 12 week .</detailed_description>
