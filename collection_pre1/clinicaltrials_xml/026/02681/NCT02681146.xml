	<brief_summary>A stepped-wedge cluster design use , duration trial 50 week . The 'stepped-wedge ' cluster randomise trial form cross-over design unidirectional cross-over ( control experimental ) randomisation cluster undertakes transition . In stepped-wedge design , stagger roll-out intervention , time hence sequence unit ( cluster ) start intervention period determine random allocation . The randomisation occur start trial . All cluster start trial control phase intervention deliver site , sequentially cross control group intervention group , sit receive intervention . Outcomes measure study participant cluster every time period , hence measurement outcome take place step wedge ; cluster provide data point control intervention condition allow site act control .</brief_summary>
