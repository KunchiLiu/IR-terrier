	<detailed_description>The purpose study mine Premier Healthcare Database : 1. define incidence post-operative cognitive complication , acute kidney injury stroke specific cardiac surgical procedure ( define : coronary artery bypass graft [ CABG ] , Aortic Valve Replacement , Mitral valve repair , Mitral valve replacement , thoracic aortic operation , combine CABG Valve replacement repair ; 2 . Determine incremental increase length hospitalization cost hospitalization among cardiac surgical patient suffer postoperative cognitive complication , acute kidney injury stroke ; 3 . Determine effectiveness intraoperative neuromonitoring cerebral saturation and/or process electroencephalogram ( EEG ) monitor incidence post-operative cognitive complication , acute kidney injury stroke consequence specific cardiac surgery procedure . The Premier Healthcare Database privately own database represent approximately 1/5th United States hospitalization annually . It include International Classification Diseases-9th Revision ( ICD-9 ) International Classification Diseases-Clinical Modification ( ICD-9-CM ) diagnosis procedure code record hospital , well limited set Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT ) -4 code . Within database , discharge-level data include information patient provider characteristic , diagnose procedure , hospital resource utilization , charges/cost data entry , include pharmacy charge .</detailed_description>
