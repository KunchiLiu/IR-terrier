	<brief_title>ALERT : A Phase II Study Alternating Eribulin Hormonal Therapy Pre-treated ER+ve Breast Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>12 patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer receive least one hormonal therapy least one chemotherapy metastatic setting enrol receive treatment . Once patient consent complete study screening , eribulin AI treatment alternate 9 month , disease progression unacceptable toxicity , whichever sooner . Patients attend safety follow-up visit 4 week complete treatment . Eribulin ( Halaven® ) non-taxane microtubule dynamic inhibitor . Eribulin inhibit growth phase microtubule without affect shorten phase sequesters tubulin non-productive aggregate . Eribulin exert effect via tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism lead G2/M cell-cycle block , disruption mitotic spindle , , ultimately , apoptotic cell death prolong mitotic blockage . Eribulin licence treatment patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer previously receive least one chemotherapeutic regimen treatment advance disease . Prior therapy include anthracycline taxane either adjuvant metastatic setting unless patient suitable treatment . The aim study alternate eribulin aromatase inhibitor , examine whether may breakthrough relapse AI therapy hand extend duration eribulin may use . Importantly , blood base biomarkers , tumour derive fraction cfDNA ( ctDNA ) , circulate tumour cell measure . A major aim study test whether biomarkers fluctuate chemotherapy AI treatment set advanced breast cancer .</detailed_description>
