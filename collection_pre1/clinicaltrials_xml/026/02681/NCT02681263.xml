	<brief_summary>The present study aim demonstrate efficacy temocillin treatment UTI require parenteral therapy due confirm ESBL produce AmpC hyperproducing Enterobacteriaceae , resistant quinolones Bactrim® France . In addition , study describe support use high dose ( 6g/day ) temocillin could interest treatment urinary tract infection due multi-resistant bacteria high MIC ( 32 mg/L ) . The investigator also evaluate tolerance drug monitoring adverse event incidence eventual Clostridium difficile associate infection .</brief_summary>
