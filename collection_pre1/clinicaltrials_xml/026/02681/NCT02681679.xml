	<detailed_description>Since new generation femtosecond laser become available cataract surgery 2009 , use image-guided system provide several benefit , include reduction phacoemulsification energy prefragmentation crystalline lens , potential advantage precise corneal incision capsulotomy formation . However , new surgical technique , femtosecond laser cataract surgery also potential complication . Intraoperative miosis one common intraoperative complication femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery , report prevalence range 9.5 32.0 % . Significant pupillary constriction necessitates removal anterior capsule flap , fragment nucleus remain cortex , potentially associate high rate surgery-related complication . Intraoperative miosis may due intraocular effect occur femtosecond laser pretreatment . The intraocular tissue may expose laser emission , lens protein release anterior chamber . Together , event trigger release unwanted cytokine . In previous study , intraocular prostaglandin concentration find increase immediately femtosecond laser pretreatment . Prostaglandins , especially prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , know play role inflammation-induced miosis . Preoperative topical treatment NSAIDs inhibit release prostaglandin response surgically-induced miosis suppress cyclooxygenase , enzyme transforms arachidonic acid prostaglandin precursor . The effectiveness ophthalmic NSAIDs preventing miosis well documented conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery . However , whether effect also applicable femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery unknown . Yeoh suggest addition NSAID eye drop dilation regimen femtosecond laser cataract surgery , randomize study conduct support theory . Given increase popularity femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery , investigator seek study whether topical NSAIDs might beneficial pupil maintenance PGE2 inhibition procedure .</detailed_description>
