	<brief_summary>Sepsis common , expensive , frequently fatal highly complex inflammatory syndrome wherein multiple cellular humoral pathway involve . Since 's multifactorial syndrome merely block one various inflammatory pathway may suffice provide effective treatment may partly explain adjunctive therapy develop severe sepsis yield disappointing result rigorous clinical trial . Statins vary pleiotropic effect inflammatory mediator addition current adjuvant therapy septic shock may help reduction mortality . The present trial aim study survival benefit change bio-marker level septic shock . Adult patient ( &gt; =18 year ) septic shock admit ICU include study . Patients randomize per computer generate random number Drug ( Atorvastatin , 40 mg ) match placebo group . Drug placebo give select patient via nasogastric tube 7 day . Bio marker ( Il-6 , TNF-alpha ) estimate trial week ( Days 1 , 4 , 7 ) . All clinical study personnel patient remain blinded study group assignment throughout trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : - Study impact statins level biomarkers ( IL-6 TNF-Î± ) sepsis . - Study survival benefit statin septic shock . Introduction : Sepsis lead cause mortality non-coronary ICUs . Mortality associate sepsis still considerably high . Rising economic burden manage sepsis major concern . Statin anti-hyperlipidemic drug pleiotropic effect . It property like anti-inflammatory/oxidative , immunomodulatory effect , enhance endothelial function , reduction blood thrombogenicity , increase nitric oxide ( NO ) bioavailability . Available evidence suggest statin may play positive role reduction mortality sepsis . However , multidimensional heterogeneous character available study allow draw firm conclusion usefulness sepsis septic shock . This randomized , double blind , placebo control trial attempt study impact statins mortality biomarker level septic shock . Details material method : Patients &gt; = age 18 yr meeting American European consensus conference definition septic shock enrol study . After write informed consent primary decision maker patient randomize either drug placebo group . Each group either receive Atorvastatin 40mg match placebo 7 day . IL-6 TNF alpha level estimate D1 , D4 D7 trial week . Relevant clinical laboratory ( clinical biochemistry , hematological , coagulation parameter , LFT renal function test ) record simultaneously . Severity score , event free day ( vasopressor , ventilation , dialysis , transfusion , parenteral nutrition ) , mortality 28 day inclusion study record . Ethical Issues : Written inform consent take either patient ( possible ) primary decision maker relate patient . Study population : A total 80 patient septic shock admit ICU enrol study . Patients either admitted septic shock develop septic shock stay ICU eligible inclusion study . The statin placebo group 40 patient .</detailed_description>
