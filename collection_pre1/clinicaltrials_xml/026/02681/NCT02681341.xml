	<detailed_description>ENDPOINTS 1 . OR experience : suturability , handle , hemostasis , compliance recipient vessel , blood loss , OR time . 2 . In-hospital survival 3 . MAE ( Stroke , MI , death ) 4 . 1 Month duplex US scan 5 . 6 month duplex US scan Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 1 . Less 50 % stenosis 6 month ( PSV &lt; 150 cm/s ) Safety Endpoint Incidence CardioCel relate Major Adverse Cardiac Events ( MACE ) 6 month , define study : - Structural CardioCel failure - aneurysm/dilation - Vasculitis - Leak pseudoaneurysm - Dehiscence - Thromboembolism - Thrombosis - Haemolysis - Reoperation explant Review endpoint 6 month confirm result meet expectation Principal Investigator . BACKGROUND Rationale Study : CardioCel 's unique strength , pliability , resistance degradation calcification make promising alternative synthetic fabric xenographic material incompletely decellularized detoxify ( aldehyde removal ) . Device Description : Tissue-engineered CardioCel pericardium manufacture bovine spongiform encephalopathy-free pericardium ( 37 ) . Manufacturing consist several tissue-engineering process , include step remove lipid , cell cell remnant , nucleic acid ( DNA , RNA ) Gal epitope . In addition , cross-linking achieve ultra-low engineered glutaraldehyde concentration minimise glutaraldehyde cytotoxicity level ( Admedus Ltd. proprietary ) . Cytotoxicity reduce ADAPTÂ® anti-calcification process non-glutaraldehyde sterilisation storage solution . CardioCel US FDA clear repair cardiac vascular defect , include intra-cardiac defect ; septal defect , valve annulus repair , great vessel reconstruction , peripheral vascular reconstruction , suture line buttress pericardial closure . STUDY DESIGN This prospective , non-randomized , single arm study . SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS/DATA COLLECTION ENROLLMENT : 10 subject enrol per site DURATION OF ENROLLMENT : Patients follow 6 month CEA procedure . SCREENING A pre-screening procedure may perform determine whether patient meet inclusion/exclusion eligibility selection criterion . A pre-screened patient ask sign inform consent form study-specific test procedure perform . Subject screen number assign visit subject evaluate eligibility criterion . BASELINE Informed consent obtain subject potential trial candidate prior commencement study related procedure . The following baseline data collect subject prior procedure : - Patient demographic - Standard care Physical Examination - Vital Signs ( Blood pressure heart rate ) - Medical history ( cardiovascular risk factor ) - Standard care Clinical Lab test - Final confirmation Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria IMPLANT PROCEDURE Patients undergo CEA patch arterioplasty . Patients manage accord standard pre-operative , operative , postoperative care . The following OR Experience data collect subject : - Suturability - Handling - Hemostasis - Compliance recipient vessel - Blood loss - OR time - In-hospital survival - MAE ( Stroke , MI , death ) FOLLOW-UP VISITS Patients return follow-up visit include carotid duplex ultrasound 1 6 month . Follow-up visit may also include physical examination adverse event review . The following follow-up data collect subject : - Standard care physical examination - 1 Month duplex US scan- Duplex US scan velocity , calibre , occlusion/lesion status - 6 month duplex US scan- Duplex US scan velocity , calibre , occlusion/lesion status - MAE ( Stroke , MI , death ) AE review visit STATISTICAL ANALYSIS &amp; DATA MANAGEMENT : Principal Investigator plan follow patient 6 month create report ( white paper ) OR experience 6 month follow-up . The study direct observation 6 month follow-up patient undergo CEA patch arterioplasty . No control group include study , comparative analysis plan . DATA MONITORING Internal monitoring conduct periodically . CRF 's , source document , informed consent form , study deviation include ; finding report PI . Deviations document report accord IRB policy . Regulatory document audit Baylor Research Institute Department Research Compliance upon request .</detailed_description>
