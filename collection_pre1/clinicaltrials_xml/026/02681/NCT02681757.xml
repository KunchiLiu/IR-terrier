	<brief_summary>The aim study compare Mepitel Ag Triple antibiotic ointment impregnate Adaptic gauze use soft cast technique ass overall time healing , yeast infection rate parent perception pain level time dress change scale 1-10 . The hypothesis Mepitel Ag combination soft cast technique improve wound heal pediatric partial deep partial thickness hand foot burn decrease length healing time , decrease risk yeast infection , decrease pain associate dressing change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Mepitel Ag v Antibiotic Ointment Used With Soft Cast Technique Treatment Pediatric Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There currently gold standard dress come treat hand foot burn , specifically pediatric population . Our institution currently utilize soft cast technique ( SCT ) hand foot burn . The SCT use triple antibiotic ointment ( TAO ) impregnate Adaptic gauze , kling kerlex , cast padding , gypsoma plaster , soft cast material , coban . This dress apply one two time first 2 week post injury . The underlie dress change nystatin impregnated Adaptic gauze , kling kerlex , cast padding , gypsoma plaster , soft cast material , coban remainder treatment time surgery indicate debridement graft wound . The soft cast technique provide optimal position wounded hand foot , allow moist wound environment , offer protection injured extremity wound heals . The literature reveal early surgical intervention perform first 7 10 day post injury show help achieve maximal function decrease risk hypertrophic scar formation . A review current literature demonstrate silver sulfadiazine ( SSD ) frequently use dress burn wind treatment many clinic nationwide . The use SSD associate twice daily painful dressing change wind exposure `` may lead disruption newly form epithelium , wound colonization , subsequent wound infection deepen burn '' . One major benefit SCT reduction require dressing change , soft cast stay place 7-10 day maintain optimal hand foot positioning . This eliminate need painful dressing change . Occasionally clinic , observed yeast infection soft cast patient require serial casting . Other complication include occasional dry adaptic gauze , lead painful dress removal interruption newly epithelialized wound bed . Mepitel Ag , new soft silicone dress produce Molnlycke Health Care , combine Safetac technology silver compound provide broad spectrum antimicrobial coverage , last 8 day , minimize damage new epithelium create moist wound environment . The safetac technology `` protect wound skin . It prevent out dress stick wound , therefore minimize trauma pain '' . The highly pliable nature antimicrobial property dress make ideal alternative TAO SSD treatment pediatric partial deep partial thickness hand foot burn .</detailed_description>
