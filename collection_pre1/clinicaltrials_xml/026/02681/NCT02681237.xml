	<brief_summary>This proof concept study ( study initially assess benefit new drug indication ) combination two investigational drug cediranib olaparib patient ovarian cancer whose cancer worsen despite previously receive poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor ( olaparib ) . The purpose study find whether take cediranib olaparib time able stop tumor grow shrink . Cediranib work block ( inhibit ) several specific protein cancer cell call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor . These protein important formation blood vessel tumor . It believe many tumor survive blood vessel tumor bring oxygen nutrient cancer cell enable grow . If formation blood vessel block , tumor cell may die . Olaparib , work block protein call poly [ adenosine diphosphate-ribose ] polymerase ( PARP ) . PARP important protein try fix damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA , molecules contain important instruction development cell ) . Many cancer think develop damage DNA . By block PARP fix damage DNA , tumor cell may die . Adding cediranib olaparib , therefore block several different mechanism cancer growth , may stop tumor growth .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt; = 18 year . Performance status &lt; = 2 . Histologically confirm ovarian cancer , high grade serous high grade endometrioid histology subtype . Radiographically documented disease progression within 28 day registration evaluable . Radiological progression PARP inhibitor therapy ( example : olaparib ) : cohort platinum sensitive recurrence response least 6 month PARP inhibitor treatment cohort platinum resistance disease progression within 6 month last dose platinum base chemotherapy Patients discontinue PARP therapy eligible break therapy intervene therapy . Patients must adequate bone marrow , renal hepatic function per local laboratory reference range . Ongoing prior toxicity relate previous treatment must recover &lt; = grade 2 time registration . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; = 50 % echocardiogram multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan within 28 day registration . Acceptable urine dipstick/urine analysis proteinuria . Patients willing undergo tumour biopsy pretreatment biopsy time progression olaparib available . Life expectancy great 3 month . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patient 's willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Patients child bear potential partner sexually active must agree use 2 highly effective form contraception throughout participation study treatment 3 month last dose study treatment ( ) . Patients current bowel obstruction . Patients know brain metastasis . Unacceptable mean correct QT ( QTc ) screen electrocardiogram within 7 day registration history familial long QT syndrome . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited hypertension , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . A New York Heart Association classification III IV . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition olaparib cediranib . Patients unable swallow orally administer medication patient gastrointestinal disorder likely interfere absorption study medication . Patients myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia . Immunocompromised patient , e.g. , patient know serologically positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , patient know active hepatitis ( i.e. , hepatitis B C ) due risk transmit infection blood body fluid . Patients require maximal dos calcium channel blocker stabilize blood pressure . Patients significant hemorrhage haemoptysis . Patients recent ( within 2 week registration , wound completely heal ) major thoracic abdominal surgery prior study start , surgical incision fully heal . History stroke transient ischemic attack within six month . Patients receive stop follow prohibited medication prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make subject inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
