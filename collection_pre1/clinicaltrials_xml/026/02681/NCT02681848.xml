	<brief_title>What Are Effects Varenicline Compared With Nicotine Replacement Therapy Long Term Smoking Cessation Clinically Important Outcomes ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background Smoking major avoidable cause preventable morbidity premature mortality UK internationally [ 5,6 ] . Smoking also principal cause health inequality responsible difference healthy life-expectancy richest poor society [ 10 ] without mental health problem [ 11 ] . It estimate smoking-related illness cost NHS approximately Â£5bn per year [ 7 ] . Varenicline show clinically effective smoking cessation medicine short-term abstinence randomize control trial ( RCTs ) [ 12 ] . However , little evidence long-term effectiveness impact clinical outcome relevant NHS . Although RCTs consider gold standard evaluation intend effect medicine , less appropriate determining unintended unexpected beneficial adverse effect several reason . Data RCTs varenicline typically less year follow-up , relatively low power detect effect clinically-relevant outcome , informative longer-term consequence varenicline treatment [ 12 ] . Furthermore , RCTs usually exclude smoker chronic respiratory heart disease psychiatric illness , finding may generalisable patient [ 12 ] . Observational study use large primary care databases electronic health record may use address unanswered question , investigator propose . The investigator recently investigate short-term relationship smoke cessation treatment suicide , self-harm , depression all-cause mortality use CPRD data [ 13 ] . The investigator find evidence increase risk suicidal behaviour patient prescribed varenicline . The investigator concerned conventional observational estimate effect varenicline bias residual confounding indication . If patient prescribe varenicline differed patient prescribe smoke cessation treatment prior first prescription , investigator could certain whether difference outcome due medication patient receive , pre-existing difference patient [ 23,32 ] . In investigator previous study investigator try overcome confounding indication use three statistical approach : conventional multivariable-adjusted regression , propensity score match analysis , instrumental variable analysis [ 4 ] . The investigator use physician ' prescribing preference instrumental variable , describe Section 1 , physician ' prescription varenicline nicotine replacement product . In conventional observational analysis , adjustment wide range observable patient characteristic , patient prescribe varenicline 51 % low risk all-cause mortality prescribe nicotine replacement product nine month first prescription , ( hazard ratio=0.49 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) : 0.40 0.61 ) . However , investigator find little evidence reduction all-cause mortality use instrumental variable analysis ( risk difference per 1,000 prescriptions=0.7 , 95 % CI : -3.3 4.7 ) . This suggest conventional multivariable-adjusted regression may suffer bias due unmeasured confounding , effect size implausible . Smoking strongly pattern socio-economic status UK [ 33 ] ; 2011 Government Health Survey , prevalence smoke 31 % amongst individual routine occupation compare 10 % amongst individual higher managerial professional occupation ( ASH ) [ 34 ] . A recent systematic review report NHS stop-smoking service may help reduce inequality smoke prevalence preferentially target smoker low socio-economic status ( SES ) [ 35 ] . These finding support data primary care record ( The Health Improvement Network ) , show 2008 2010 , smoker deprive group likely receive smoke cessation intervention [ 36 ] . A recent telephone survey England find evidence difference rate self-reported smoking cessation medication use type medication use category SES . However , survey demonstrate clear difference success quit attempt SES , rate lowest low SES group [ 37 ] . More research urgently require area use large clinical database understand difference smoke cessation medication effectiveness SES . Evidence explain research need : The US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) mandate varenicline carry black box warning ( agency 's strong safety warn ) label highlight increase risk suicidal ideation depression patient prescribe varenicline base spontaneous report FDA Adverse Events Reporting ( FDA AERS ) database [ 38 ] . These warning mean indicate causal effect pharmaceutical . However , increase number experimental observational study suggest little difference risk adverse neuropsychiatric effect varenicline compare nicotine replacement product . On October 16th 2014 , FDA hold joint meeting Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee Drug Safety Risk Management Advisory Committee : ( ) Discuss safety data observational study meta-analysis RCTs since emergence original signal serious neuropsychiatric adverse event varenicline lead black box warning 2009 ; ( ii ) Determine whether change make description risk varenicline 's product labelling . This project significant extension previous research undertake group part Medicines Healthcare product Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) grant ( SDS 33437 ) `` Medicines may promote suicide : pharmacoepidemiological analysis risk risk assessment '' . The focus earlier grant investigate whether varenicline cause suicide self-harm . The investigator produce write report finding MHRA present finding orally Pharmacovigilance Expert Advisory Group ( PEAG ) Commission Human Medicines [ 39 ] . This committee deliberate potential new signal risk associated pharmacotherapies . Two major question identify future research priority PEAG : regulator interpret result instrumental variable study conflict conventional multivariable-adjusted observational analysis ? Is possible give definitive guidance instrumental variable analysis likely low bias ? Currently , epidemiological literature sufficiently develop conclusively . The investigator address gap literature methodological component proposal . This significantly understanding instrumental variable analysis use address problem confound indication . Additionally , proposal provide evidence regard effectiveness varenicline respect long term smoking cessation clinically relevant outcome . This aid regulators determine whether benefit varenicline treatment outweigh possible risk . The investigator report result research regulator . 2 . Aims 1 . To investigate long-term smoking abstinence patient prescribe either varenicline nicotine replacement product CPRD . 2 . What causal effect smoke cessation : 1. frequency GP attendance , 2. frequency all-cause cause-specific hospitalisation , 3. all-cause cause-specific mortality , 4. incident diagnosis respiratory illness , 5. incident diagnosis myocardial infarction 6. incident diagnosis depression anxiety . 3 . To investigate difference effectiveness smoke cessation medication long-term smoking abstinence area level deprivation . 4 . Design theoretical/conceptual framework The investigator use CPRD conduct cohort study patient prescribe varenicline nicotine replacement product . The study type `` Hypothesis testing '' . Exposure define first prescription either varenicline nicotine replacement therapy . The investigator investigate difference follow outcomes describe . For statistical analysis investigator use Cox-regression model adjust range baseline confounders , propensity score match Cox-regression , instrumental variable analysis use physician ' prescribing preference instrument prescription issue . Power calculations The follow power calculation base effect size confidence interval observe investigator previous analysis , data 110,000 individual prescribe either varenicline nicotine replacement therapy [ 13 ] . Based rate 18,000 new prescription per year observe CPRD 2006 2011 [ 13 ] , 4 year follow-up number patient prescribe either varenicline nicotine replacement therapy increase 72,000 . Therefore total expected sample size analysis around 180,000 . In investigator previous analysis use CPRD data age- sex-adjusted hazard ratio self-harm/suicide varenicline vs. nicotine replacement therapy nine month 0.73 ( 95 % CI : 0.54 0.99 ) ; adjust possible confounders become : 0.90 ( 95 % CI : 0.66 1.22 ) [ 13 ] . A 70 % increase sample size would lead reduction standard error factor 1.3 , reduce breadth above-adjusted confidence interval 0.56 0.43 . Rare outcome , self-harm suicide , use previous analysis ; investigator great power explore common outcome measure within project . For example , previous analysis nine month age- sex-adjusted hazard ratio all-cause mortality nine month first prescription varenicline vs. nicotine replacement therapy 0.43 ( 95 % CI : 0.35 0.53 ) ; control possible confounders become : 0.49 ( 95 % CI : 0.40 0.61 ) . A 70 % increase sample size would lead reduction standard error factor 1.3 , reduce breadth above-adjusted confidence interval 0.21 0.16 . For effect varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy all-cause mortality , instrumental variable analysis find risk difference 0.7 ( 95 % CI : -3.3 4.7 ) per 1,000 patient treated nine month . A 70 % increase sample size would narrow confidence interval 8.0 6.2 . Data collection analysis The investigator use late available release CPRD . This General Practices enrol CPRD send regular tranche data release researcher throughout year . This guarantee large possible sample patient analysis . Data analysis Defining exposure , outcome covariates Exposures First time user smoke cessation therapy ( varenicline nicotine replacement therapy ) define people receive least one prescription product 1st September 2006 use related product 12 month index date ( first date prescription issue ) . Langley et al . ( 2010 ) find smoke cessation prescription data THIN database , closely related CPRD , highly comparable national dispensing data [ 41 ] . The analysis limit first treatment episode . This mimic intention treat analysis RCT [ 42 ] . The prescription define therapy file CPRD , contain list prescription issue patient practice . Each therapy record record date prescription issue , quantity drug prescribe dosage . To mimic intention-to-treat analysis RCT primary analysis patient initially prescribed nicotine replacement therapy , later switch varenicline allocate nicotine replacement therapy vice-versa . Outcomes Smoking abstinence In CPRD smoking status indicate whether patient current , former never smoker . As GPs pay record smoking status smoke behaviour robustly record CPRD [ 43 ] . Marston et al . ( 2014 ) find 84 % patient smoke status record within year registering practice , smoke prevalence rate age similar CPRD Health Survey England [ 43 ] . Booth et al . ( 2013 ) find difference prevalence smoke estimate CPRD Health Survey England less 1 % , mean difference 0.1 % ( 95 % CI : -1.5 % 1.7 % ) [ 44 ] . Using unpublished data CPRD sample part research report Thomas et al . ( 2013 ) investigator find 74 % patient prescribe smoke cessation medication subsequent record indicate smoking status . Of 66 % indicated current smoker 33 % ex-smokers . The investigator initially define patient relapse record indicate patient current smoker first prescription smoke cessation therapy . The investigator able determine smoking status patient return GP . Therefore , investigator perform sensitivity analysis examine whether assumption make smoking status individual observe affect result . For example , investigator conduct sensitivity analysis see result alter assume patient miss data relapse , assume patient miss outcomes achieve abstinence . Service use The investigator define service use number visit GP hospital 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 48 month first prescription . The investigator define GP appointment use clinical data file CPRD . This include diagnose symptom GPs record patient . As outcome , vast majority diagnose symptom include date data add database . The investigator use date define visit primary care . The investigator define hospital visit outcome use link Hospital Episodes Statistics data . This available approximately half sample . Again data contain date event occur , investigator use define attendance secondary care within 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 48 month first prescription . All-cause cause-specific mortality The investigator define all-cause cause-specific mortality use link Office National Statistics mortality dataset . These include date death cause death use ICD-9 code . The investigator investigate three specific cause mortality , 1 ) diseases respiratory system ( ICD-9=460-519 ) , 2 ) cardiovascular disease ( ICD-9=390-459 ) 3 ) mental disorder ( ICD-9=290-319 ) . Adverse event The investigator define adverse event outcome use diagnosis record Clinical Referral file CPRD . These file record diagnose GPs input computer system . Each record table give diagnosis code base Read code categorisation . The investigator use validate Read code list , three adverse event outcome , respiratory illness , myocardial infarction depression anxiety [ 45-47 ] . For eligible patient investigator extract record Clinical Referral Tables indicate patient either receive specific diagnosis refer specific diagnosis . As therapy record prescription describe , Clinical Referral Record indicate date information inputted system . The investigator use date define date diagnosis make . Covariates The investigator include gender , age year time first prescription , previous psychiatric illness/consultation , previous use psychotropic medication hypnotic , antipsychotic antidepressant , previous self-harm , measure alcohol consumption appropriate mean/median number GP visit per year , body mass index , socioeconomic position ( deprivation score area residence ) major chronic illness ( include diabetes , cancer , arthritis ) use Charlson index [ 48,49 ] . Relevant Read code identify either validated code list search event Read code dictionary identify miss Read code . Collider bias could occur investigator condition event happen result prescription patient issue . To prevent bias affect result , investigator define covariate use data inputted prior first prescription [ 50 ] . 5 . Statistical Analysis For investigate effect varenicline use outcome ( long-term smoking cessation , frequency GP hospital attendance , all-cause cause-specific mortality , primary care diagnosis respiratory illness , myocardial infarction , depression anxiety ) , investigator report conventional multivariable-adjusted regression , propensity score regression instrumental variable analysis . A . Conventional Cox-regression In first analysis , conventional observational analysis , investigator estimate hazard ratio outcome use Cox-proportional hazard model actual prescription issue patient [ 26 ] . Each patient 's date entry cohort date first prescribe smoke cessation therapy . The date exit outcome date first event , censor due end follow-up death leave practice . The investigator report association adjust basic confounders ( age gender ) , result adjust measured covariates describe . B. Propensity score regression In second analysis investigator construct sample patient balance covariates risk factor use propensity score [ 27,28,51,52 ] . The investigator construct propensity score use logistic regression actual treatment receive covariates describe . Therefore , participant 's propensity score conditional probability ( odds ) receive varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy . The investigator match patient receive varenicline another patient receive nicotine replacement therapy close propensity score ratio 1:1 use near neighbour algorithm replacement , match restricted common support region . Patients outside common support region prescribe varenicline propensity score high patient prescribe nicotine replacement therapy vice versa . The investigator estimate hazard ratio outcome use propensity score match sample use Cox-regressions use entry exit information conventional Cox-regression analysis describe . C. Instrumental variable analysis In third analysis , investigator estimate effect smoke cessation therapy outcomes use physician ' prescribing preference instrument prescription GPs issue patient . The investigator directly measure physician ' preference , therefore investigator use prescription issue previous patient proxy preference . For example , instrument base one previous prescription , physicians previously prescribe varenicline would categorise varenicline prescriber . See Section 2 detail . As investigator ' previous study investigator use seven prior prescription improve strength instrument [ 1,13,14 ] . Using multiple prior prescription maximise power ; previous study , investigator include multiple prior prescription improve efficiency estimator . The investigator report risk difference outcomes use additive structural mean model estimate via generalised method moment [ 53-55 ] . The investigator categorise adverse event outcome occur within 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 48 month first prescription . The investigator method conduct survival analysis use instrumental variable well develop . The investigator use Stata 13.1 SE generate result . The instrumental variable analysis conduct use ivreg2 command psmatch2 use construct propensity score [ 51,56,57 ] . All standard error estimate use cluster robust standard error account cluster patient within practice . D. Socio-economic variation effectiveness smoke cessation treatment Area level deprivation assign patient use home address postcode GP practice use practice postcode . Deprivation level base Indices Multiple Deprivation ( IMD ) available Office National Statistics . IMD statistic update every two year . The investigator use recent IMD statistic precede date entry study patient . Although area level deprivation statistic proxy individual level deprivation , demonstrate expect association smoke prevalence [ 58 ] . By use individual GP level IMD code , investigator investigate whether effect smoke cessation therapy differ IMD level GP practice individual level . For patient , investigator investigate treatment compliance reporting total number prescription issue initial prescription . The investigator estimate effect smoke cessation therapy within sub-groups define IMD level individual practice level use three method describe , multivariable-adjusted Cox regression , propensity score regression instrumental variable analysis [ 26,31,52 ] . The cohort patient define describe . The investigator report association adjust basic confounders ( age gender ) , result adjust measured covariates describe . Analyses account cluster patient GP practice . E. Sensitivity analyse The investigator perform sensitivity analysis examine whether assumption make smoking status individual observe affect result . For example , investigator conduct sensitivity analysis see result alter assume patient miss data relapse , assume patient miss outcome data achieve abstinence .</detailed_description>
