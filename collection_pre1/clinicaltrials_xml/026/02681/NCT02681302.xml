	<brief_summary>The goal study determine safety clinical effect combine checkpoint inhibition administer autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation six clinical cohort high risk recurrent disease . In addition assess incidence severity adverse event rate complete response progression free survival , investigator intend monitor immune reconstitution , phenotype TCR repertoire throughout treatment time disease progression . Investigators also analyze gut microbiome prior conditioning , throughout treatment , post-transplant time relapse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combined Check Point Inhibition After Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Patients High Risk Post-transplant Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase Ib-IIA study post-transplant combine check point inhibitor patient high risk relapse ( &gt; 50 % ) autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant . Patients accrue study disease group follow separately group incidence severity toxicity , ability receive intend schedule combine check point inhibitor complete response progression free survival ( PFS ) rate . Complete response progression free survival rate compare publish standard disease group . Expected PFS 18 month post-transplant group without check point inhibitor less 50 % . Each group PFS 18 month 4 patient ( 57 % ) consider eligibility successor phase IIB expansion trial .</detailed_description>
