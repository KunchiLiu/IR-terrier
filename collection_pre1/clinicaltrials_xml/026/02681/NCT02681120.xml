	<brief_summary>This pilot , non-randomized , single institution , observational study investigate effect dramatic weight loss secondary bariatric surgery biomarkers breast cancer tissue blood well image woman elevate risk breast cancer . Twelve month bariatric surgery , 50 % excess weight generally expect . Eligible woman elevate risk breast cancer already plan undergo bariatric surgery consent undergo imaging ( MRI mammogram ) , breast tissue biopsy , fast blood draw prior bariatric surgery , approximately 14 day bariatric surgery , approximately 1 year bariatric surgery . In parallel also assess 40 normal breast tissue specimens well blood sample Komen Tissue Bank ( elevate risk normal BMI ) establish normal BMI , elevate risk control group study . The KTB sample match general risk breast cancer ( &gt; 20 % ) , age , race menopausal status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1 . The effect bariatric surgery Background Parenchymal Enhancement ( BPE ) breast MRI comparative analysis image woman pre- 1 year post-bariatric surgery . 2 . The effect bariatric surgery breast density see standard four view mammogram process commercial volumetric breast density measurement software ( volpara®density™ ) comparative analysis image woman pre- 1 year post-bariatric surgery . Secondary Objectives 3 . The impact bariatric surgery obesity associate immune marker breast tissue : - Comparing cellular immune component normal breast tissue lobule look immune infiltrates [ B cell ( CD20 ) , cytotoxic T cell ( CD8 ) , helper T cell ( CD4 ) , dendritic cell ( CD11c ) , leukocytes ( CD45 ) , monocytes/macrophages ( CD68 ) ] normal breast lean woman obese woman pre- 14 day 1 year post-bariatric surgery . - Assessing presence crown like structure ( CLS ) normal breast lean woman obese woman pre- 14 day 1 year post-bariatric surgery . 4 . The effect bariatric surgery aromatase expression breast tissue woman pre- 14 day 1 year post-bariatric surgery compare level breast tissue lean woman Komen Tissue Bank ( KTB ) . 5 . The effect bariatric surgery blood correlatives pre- 14 day 1 year post-bariatric surgery include : 1 ) PGE2 , TNF alpha , IL1 beta , IL-8 IL-10 inflammatory pathway ; 2 ) adiponectin , leptin , insulin , IGF1 , IGFBP3 insulin pathway ; 3 ) estradiol , SHBG , E2 , T DHEAS hormonal pathway .</detailed_description>
