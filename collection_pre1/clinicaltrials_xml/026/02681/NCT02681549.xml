	<brief_summary>The purpose phase 2 trial study activity pembrolizumab combination bevacizumab patient untreated brain metastasis melanoma NSCLC determine activity safety drug combination . Furthermore , patient undergo resection biopsy brain metastasis , evaluate biomarkers predictive treatment benefit , also conduct correlative biomarker study extra-cerebral specimen patient systemic biopsy feasible archival tumor tissue available . A total 53 eligible patient enrol trial ( 20 melanoma 33 NSCLC ) . Individual cohort study stop insufficient activity observe first stage cohort . The study accrue approximately 24 month , open approximately 12 additional month patient study follow .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Biopsy proven metastatic melanoma nonsquamous NSCLC least one untreated cerebral metastasis least 5 mm AND twice MRI slice thickness , less Page 22 71 20 mm , asymptomatic require local therapy time enrollment ( `` clinically evaluable lesion ( ) '' ) . 2 . Age ≥18 3 . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 4 . Any number previous treatment exception previous inhibitor PD1 , PDL1 , PDL2 . Other prior systemic therapy must administer least 2 week administration pembrolizumab ; exception ipilimumab must administer least 4 week prior start pembrolizumab . Patients require prior systemic therapy . 5 . Life expectancy least 3 month 6 . A history previously treat brain metastasis allow , provide least 14 day lapse radiation initiation pembrolizumab . Any lesion present time WBRT include stereotactic radiotherapy field ( within 2mm treated lesion ) NOT consider evaluable unless new document progressed since treatment . 7 . PDL1 expression tumor tissue site require patient NSCLC . Tumor tissue archival , however archival tissue available biopsy mube obtain PDL1 test . PDL1 expression analyze Merck assay . PDL1 expression require patient melanoma , melanoma patient require submit extracerebral specimen analysis , unless feasible obtain one . 8 . Patients must normal organ marrow function 9 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 10 . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 5.7.2 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . 11 . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Symptomatic brain metastasis . Any neurologic symptom present must resolve withlocal therapy time administration study drug . 2 . Patients brain metastasis complete surgical resection clinically appropriate . 3 . Patients lung cancer squamous histology . 4 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy lung brain within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Previous radiation site may complete time prior initiation pembrolizumab . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Note : Toxicity recover ≤ Grade 1 allow meet inclusion requirement laboratory parameter . 5 . Has prior treatment antiPD1 PDL1 PDL2 agent . 6 . The use corticosteroid control cerebral edema treat neurologic symptom allow , patient previously require corticosteroid symptom control must steroids least 2 week . Lowdose steroid use ( ≤10 mg prednisone equivalent ) corticosteroid replacement therapy allow 7 . Has recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 8 . Presence leptomeningeal disease 9 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 10 . Pregnancy breast feed . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother pembrolizumab , breastfeed must discontinue mother treated pembrolizumab . 11 . Patients may receive investigational agent may participate study investigational agent use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . 12 . Either concurrent condition ( include medical illness , active infection require treatment intravenous antibiotic presence laboratory abnormality ) history prior condition place patient unacceptable risk he/she treat study drug medical condition confounds ability interpret data study . 13 . Concurrent , active malignancy addition study ( cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma ) 14 . Patients active hemoptysis . 15 . Any contraindication MRI ( i.e . patient pacemaker metal implanted medical device ) . An MRI safety questionnaire require prior MR image . 16 . Has active noninfectious pneumonitis 17 . Has know Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C ( HCV ) infection . 18 . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day prior first dose trial treatment . 19 . Inadequately control hypertension ( define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg ) . Antihypertensive therapy achieve parameter allowable . 20 . History myocardial infarction unstable angina within 3 month prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 21 . History stroke transient ischemic attack within 3 month prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 22 . Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm require surgical repair recent peripheral arterial thrombosis ) within 6 month prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 23 . Evidence bleed diathesis clinically significant coagulopathy ( absence therapeutic anticoagulation ) . Any history significant bleeding thrombosis discuss study PIs . 24 . Current recent ( within 10 calendar day prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 ) use dipyramidole , ticlopidine , clopidogrel , cilostazol 25 . Warfarin permit . Prophylactic therapeutic use low molecularweight heparin ( e.g. , enoxaparin ) direct thrombin inhibitor permit . 26 . History abdominal tracheoesophageal fistula gastrointestinal perforation within 6 month prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 27 . Serious , nonhealing dehisce wound 28 . Proteinuria &gt; 2.0 g protein 24hour urine collection . All patient 2 protein dipstick urinalysis baseline must undergo 24hour urine collection protein .</criteria>
