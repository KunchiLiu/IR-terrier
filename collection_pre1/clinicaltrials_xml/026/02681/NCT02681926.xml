	<brief_title>Impact New Ablation Tracking Tool Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Ablation With Contact Force Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Catheter ablation effective treatment paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) pulmonary vein isolation prevalent approach catheter ablation kind arrhythmia . Long-term success procedure diminish arrhythmia recurrence occur predominantly reconnections previously isolate pulmonary vein . The durability pulmonary vein isolation cornerstone ablation influence transmurality continuity lesion . Limited animal human study suggest correlation electrode-tissue contact radiofrequency lesion generation . Particularly , contact force ( CFs ) parameter ( minimum contact force minimum force time integral value ) strong predictor gap formation small study . High contact force ablation also associate incidence steam pop subsequent risk cardiac tamponade . A recent multicenter trial demonstrate irrigated CF-sensing catheter safe effective treatment drug refractory symptomatic PAF , unanticipated device-related adverse event . The increased percent time within investigator-targeted CF range correlate increased freedom arrhythmia recurrence . Stable CF radiofrequency application increase likelihood 12-month success . Real-time measurement contact force ( CF ) catheter ablation PAF recently confirm potentially impact procedural outcome , another small study , whatever CF visualization could assist operator avoid low high CF , CF-guided ablation affect AF recurrence . A recent tool , call VISITAG , develop ( approve EMEA ) Biosense Webster Navistar Smart Touch catheter order allow collection ablation point pre-determined characteristic , stability catheter ablation , mean contact force , drop impedance . The aim tool improve success rate procedure , reduce site reconnections well understand lesion formation point point , parallel reduce complication , avoid give unnecessary ablation shot sit already treat good set lesion . Purpose : The aim study evaluate effectiveness safety strategy use new ablation track tool ( VISITAG ; Biosense Webster ) PAF ablation contact force technology . Design : Prospective , non-randomized , multicenter , registry Medical Device : Biosense Webster : - Biosense Webster Smart Touch - Biosense Webster CARTO3 ( V3 ) system VISITAG module . - Biosense Webster CARTO3 system Subject population : Consecutive patient undergo PAF ablation abovementioned device several center Italy Enrollment : see dedicated section End-point : see dedicated section Follow-up : Follow-up perform use clinical visit ECG , 12 hour ECG monitoring , loop recorder analysis telephonic contact , follow centre strategy . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Analysis Population : All patient successfully register included analysis . Sample Size Calculations Assumptions : Being observational registry aim quantify effect estimate without direct comparison literature benchmark , investigator rely confidence interval profile sample size justification , without proceed formal power analysis . As main analysis pool analysis patient atrial fibrillation ablation , overall comprehensive analysis plan primary analytical approach . Accordingly , investigator compute target sample 209 patient enable computation reasonably precise 95 % confidence interval . Specifically , assume 12-month freedom 72.5 % AF/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia recurrence 1 year ( keep result SMART-AF trial ) , confidence interval compute adjusted Wald method would 60 % 85 % 209-patient sample ( point estimate 151/209 [ 72.5 % ] ) . Statistical Analysis : Continuous endpoint summarize present total number patient , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum , maximum . Tabulation categorical parameter include count percentage . The outcome summarize discrete continuous variable use method describe . Survival analysis ( freedom arrhythmia ) perform Kaplan-Meier method . Statistical inference base computation 95 % confidence interval use adjust Wald method . Additional analysis involve key subgroup define accord baseline , lesion , procedural feature , statistical significance set 5 % 2-tailed level . Specifically , Student , Fisher exact , log-rank test use bivariate analysis , whereas multivariable linear regression , logistic regression , Cox proportional hazard analysis use adjust confounders .</detailed_description>
