	<brief_summary>Treatment selection breast cancer still largely empiric guide large randomized clinical trial population patient . This approach inadequate selection individualize chemotherapy regimen . Estimates benefit individual extrapolation effect see large trial , necessarily apply individual patient . The revolution genomics promise transform oncology care . By good define cancer subtypes , good understand breast cancer biology help guide treatment . The up-front phase decide adopt play pivotal role useful test target therapeutic drug olaparib wich also require development new biomarkers may useful future study . With approach could possible demonstrate drug target biomarker effect clinical setting model relationship pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics . Additional benefit approach include follow : - It could facilitate rational drug selection , identify therapeutic failure early , compress timeline anticancer drug development . - It could provide initial rationale guide principle drug development base study human ( rather xenograft , tissue one specie transplant another specie ) . - As focus extensively characterize drug work whether hit intend target ( include molecular imaging study ) limit number patient could yield result would optimally inform expedite subsequent development molecularly-targeted agent</brief_summary>
