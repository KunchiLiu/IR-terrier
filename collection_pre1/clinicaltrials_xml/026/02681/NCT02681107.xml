	<brief_title>APBI : 27Gy 5 Fractions Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Previously , accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) use 3D conformal external beam technique deliver 38.5Gy 10 , twice daily , fraction cause bad fibrosis cosmetic deterioration standard whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) follow breast conserve surgery ( BCS ) woman early breast cancer . Over decade since original APBI technique design , long-term outcome various breast RT fractionation regimens become available suggest normal tissue fibrosis cosmesis vary radiobiological constant : α/β=2 rather α/β=3.4 previously estimate . Radiobiologic model use α/β=2 , indicate dose 27Gy 5 daily treatment result comparable late effect 42.5Gy 16 , 50Gy 25 fraction . This clinical trial validate safety short , convenient less costly APBI use 27Gy 5 daily fraction . Objective : To determine cosmetic normal tissue outcome APBI use 3D-conformal RT 27Gy 5 fraction 1 week . Methods : A single-arm , phase II , non-inferiority , prospective study conduct . 274 woman newly diagnose , invasive in-situ ductal carcinoma treat BCS sentinel lymph node biopsy ( axillary dissection ) candidate WBI alone , treat . Subjects age 50 year old , tumor less 3cm diameter , negative margin nodes excellent good baseline cosmetic outcome follow BCS . Patients extensive ductal carcinoma in-situ , BRCA mutation , Grade 3 cancer lymphatic vascular invasion , lobular carcinoma exclude . These selection criterion similar Canadian RAPID trial . In first phase study , 150 patient recruit interim analysis conduct rule unacceptable toxicity 2 year . Study endpoint : The primary endpoint proportion woman retain Excellent Good cosmetic score 2 year use EORTC Cosmetic Rating System clinical photograph take prior , 1 2 year RT . Secondary endpoint include rate grade breast fibrosis , induration , telangiectasia , breast pain , ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence , overall breast cancer-specific survival subsequent mastectomy rate . Sample size , statistical analysis : In RAPID trial , 88 % patient Excellent Good cosmesis prior RT Excellent Good score 3 year . Only patient Excellent/Good cosmesis baseline include current study . The proportion woman Excellent/Good cosmesis 1 2 year calculate . Using 80 % power , non-inferiority margin 0.08 one-sided binomial test non-inferiority significance level 0.05 , require sample size 249 woman evaluable 2-yr cosmesis . 274 patient recruit allow 10 % drop-out rate . To ensure safety , first interim analysis Grade 2 high breast fibrosis primary endpoint , conduct 50 patient complete 1-year assessment repeat 50 patient complete 2-year follow . If rate Grade 2 high fibrosis exceed 5 % either time point , trial accrual suspend . Feasibility : Over 600 woman eligible protocol receive RT Alberta year . If 30 % accept study participation , accrual complete &lt; 2 year .</detailed_description>
