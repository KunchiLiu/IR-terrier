	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability single ascend intravenous dos single subcutaneous ( sc ) dose ASP6294 healthy young male female subject . This study also evaluate pharmacokinetics ( pk ) single ascend intravenous dos single ascend sc dos ASP6294 ; determine effect ASP6294 administer intravenously sc serum level circulate total Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF ) ; explore potential gender difference safety , tolerability pk single intravenous dose single sc dos administration ASP6294 well determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) single intravenous dos single sc dos ASP6294 . Part 2 also evaluate relative bioavailability ASP6294 administer sc .</brief_summary>
