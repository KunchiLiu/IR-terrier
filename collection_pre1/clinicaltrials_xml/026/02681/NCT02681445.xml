	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study evaluate sensitivity specificity nanotube-based point-of-care breath-based tuberculosis screen test compare current standard care include sputum microscopy , sputum culture , chest X-ray , GeneXpert ( MTB/RIF ) . The primary objective determine initial estimate sensitivity specificity nano-tube base point-of-care test diagnosis screen active pulmonary tuberculosis . Secondary objective include collection user data test develop screen platform base end-user feedback .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TB infectious disease cause various strain mycobacteria . It typically infect lung spread air infected patient sneeze , cough , spit . When occurs , TB bacillus propel air droplet remain suspended long period time . An individual simply need inhale small amount bacilli become infected . Conventional method TB detection diagnosis traditionally perform laboratory hospital . For example , common method diagnosis TB acid fast stain sputum sample follow sputum smear microscopy test . However disadvantage sputum smear test poor sensitivity , estimate 70 % . [ 1 ] Additionally , sensitivity sputum smear spectroscopy field setting show much low ( 35 % ) , especially population high rate TB HIV coinfection . [ 2 ] Culturing mycobacterium sputum sample sensitive technique . Sputum sample collect culture either solid medium liquid medium look presence mycobacterium . However methodology take time conduct ( 3-4 week solid culture , 10-14 day liquid culture ) , make difficult employ low resource setting typically far test facility . Recently , technology develop include fluorescence microscopy smear test ( 10 % sensitive light microscopy ) , LED fluorescent microscopy inexpensive imaging equipment use field without need darkroom , rapid culture technique reduce incubation time . [ 3 ] Despite improvement make TB diagnosis , simple inexpensive POC test currently available . The technique mention either focus variation microscopy culture technique . In either case , method require lab facility highly trained personnel typically available many rural low resource area . Recent research show various strain mycobacteria produce distinct gaseous volatile biomarkers use methodology detect identify mycobacterium . [ 4,5,6 ] Specifically , Syhre Chambers find Mycobacterium tuberculosis Mycobacterium bovis culture give four specific volatile organic biomarkers ( VOBs ) : methyl phenylacetate , methyl p-anisate , methyl nicotinate , o-phenylanisole . These compound detectable visual appearance colony , could implications detection latent TB infection . [ 7 ] Syhre et al . able detect statistically significant difference methyl nicotinate breath smear positive TB patient compare healthy ( smear negative ) subject . Analyses study do use gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis tool . While effective identify quantify complex gas sample , expensive , bulky , appropriate point care ( POC ) diagnostics . These challenge associate diagnosis TB significant TB second lead cause death due single infectious organism responsible 1.3 million death annually ( 3,500 every day ) , accord WHO . Overall , estimate 2 billion people currently infect worldwide 8.6 million new active infection occur year . [ 8 ] Each individual transmit disease 10 15 people per year face mortality rate 50 % untreated . [ 9 ] The economic burden TB stagger World Bank estimate high burden country lose 7 % GDP due productivity loss TB patient caretaker . [ 10 ] It critical World Bank commit $ 100 million test treat TB India 2014 alone . Of 8.6 million new active TB case occur annually , WHO estimate roughly 3 million patient 'missed ' receive diagnosis care need . One primary reason gap delay access TB-related care long lead time diagnostic test . As result , develop new large scale screening test ( also know triage 'rule ' test ) particularly need due fact 80 % people test TB active disease , stretch limited valuable resource devote diagnostic testing . As result , FIND , world leader guide coordinate research development diseases TB , rank development new screening test one top 3 priority fight TB . [ 11 ] This pilot study conduct determine newly develop sense methodology screen TB POC base volatile biomarkers feasible use low cost solid-state sensor use functionalized 3D TiO2 nanotube array bind volatile biomarkers . If clinical sensitivity sufficient , technology could provide mean identify many 'missed ' TB patient allow test resource effort focus high risk disease . Previously , test breath profile small number patient local TB clinic confirm presence biomarkers breath ( IRB_0065207 ) . Larger patient study require gain estimate sensitivity specificity determine potential use sensor screen test . This study conduct Mumbai , India University 's Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) system use securely collect store data study .
