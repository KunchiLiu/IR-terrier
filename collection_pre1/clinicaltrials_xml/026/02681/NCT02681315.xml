	<brief_summary>This randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate influence two flow rate ( 6 liter/min versus 3 liter/min ) Heated-Humidified High-Flow-Nasal-Cannula ( HHHFNC ) rate extubation failure mechanically ventilated preterm infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Flow Rates HHHFNC Prevent Extubation Failure Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HHHFNC propose alternative nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) neonatal intensive care unit ( NICUs ) prevent extubation failure . In recent international survey periextubation practice extremely preterm infant , nCPAP common type respiratory support use ( 84 % ) follow nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation ( 55 % ) HHHFNC ( 33 % ) . Moreover , HHHFNC appear efficacy safety similar nCPAP apply immediately post-extubation prevent extubation failure preterm infant . result significantly less nasal trauma first 7 day post-extubation nCPAP . However , best flow rate HHHFNC prevent extubation failure remain know . This RCT aim compare efficacy safety postextubation respiratory support via HHHFNC two different flow rate ( 6 L/min . versus 3 L/min ) regard successful extubation period endotracheal positive pressure ventilation . We hypothesize postextubation respiratory support via HHHFNC flow rate 6 L/min . result great proportion preterm infant successfully extubated period endotracheal positive pressure ventilation compare HHHFNC flow rate 3 L/min .</detailed_description>
