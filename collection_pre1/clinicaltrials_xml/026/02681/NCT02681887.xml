	<brief_summary>In 12 week double-blind , placebo-controlled randomized trial , 120 subject obesity ( BMI≥30 kg/m2 ) pre-diabetes ( HbA1c , 5.7-6.4 % ) randomly assign 1:1 receive either placebo 2 mg controlled-release melatonin , take orally every evening 1 hour bed . The investigator assess melatonin 's effect insulin sensitivity perform hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp β-islet cell function measure use hyperglycemic clamp , primary endpoint . The investigator also evaluate melatonin supplementation 's effect mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure , nocturnal blood pressure , potential intermediate include endothelial function use brachial ultrasound , catecholamine production use 24-hour epinephrine norepinephrine excretion , renin-angiotensin system activation use measurement plasma renin activity , angiotensin II , urine aldosterone excretion . The final endpoint evaluate melatonin supplementation 's effect cellular cytokine CC family chemokine expression well high sensitivity C-reactive protein , IL-6 , TNF-α . There 24 week cohort phase extension trial . This open-label prospective study 50 subject recruit trial take 2 mg controlled-release melatonin nightly 24 week completion 12-week trial . At end cohort-phase ( 36 week entry trial ) , investigator assess extend use melatonin supplementation 24-hour BP , glycemic control ( HbA1 , fast glucose ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participant recruit locally Boston area , study visit procedure conduct Partners Harvard Catalyst . Briefly , trial-phase consist four visit , two outpatient , two inpatient . The cohort-phase consist two additional outpatient visit . The screening outpatient visit involve history taking , physical examination ( appropriate ) , phlebotomy measure circulate factor urine pregnancy test female subject . The 6-week outpatient check-up visit study coordinator . In addition evaluate adverse effect , coordinator perform pill-count . Phlebotomy perform measure circulate factor . The two inpatient visit require two overnight stay ; procedure perform two inpatient stay identical , include : timed urine collection , measurement brachial artery flow mediate dilation , phlebotomy ( include IV protocol use low dose heparin ) , hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp , hyperglycemic clamp , central blood pressure , placement ambulatory blood pressure monitor participant wear home 24 hour return pre-paid FedEx mailer . We take blood sample visit , collect 54 tablespoon ( 798.5 mL ) blood 36-week course study . Outpatient visit : A screen visit schedule participant express interest study deem potentially eligible study coordinator telephone interview . At screen visit , study physician obtain informed consent . Thereafter , study physician conduct history physical examination , phlebotomy perform . Female subject provide urine pregnancy test . The purpose screen visit evaluate potential volunteer base upon inclusion exclusion criterion list , explain purpose procedure study volunteer . If someone eligible willing , baseline inpatient visit schedule . A 6-week check schedule subject completes initial inpatient visit . In addition evaluate adverse effect , coordinator perform pill-count . Phlebotomy perform measure circulate factor . For cohort phase , 24- 36-week check visit schedule subject complete final inpatient visit . At visit , addition evaluate adverse effect , coordinator perform pill-count . Phlebotomy perform measure circulate factor . Inpatient visit : Prior inpatient visit , participant mail 9 bouillon packet ( contain 50 mmol sodium ) instruct consume 3 packet day three day prior admission Clinical Trials Center ; purpose achieve high sodium balance , necessary measurement renin-angiotensin system . The high sodium diet continue inpatient setting . Female subject urine pregnancy test do admission . The following measurement perform two inpatient visit , change measurement ( compare baseline value 8-week value ) endpoint study : 1 . A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp perform measure peripheral insulin sensitivity . Intravenous catheter place within arm ( one infusion , one blood collection ) . Then , compound call insulin ( supplied Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) ) infuse load dose follow continuous infusion achieve steady state condition . Blood sample collect every 5 minute , glucose level measure . Blood glucose level control infusion 20 % dextrose solution . The mean dextrose infusion rate ( M ) period 120 180 minute use measure insulin sensitivity . At 180 minute , study conclude , infusion stop . 2 . A hyperglycemic clamp perform measure pancreatic β-cell function . Intravenous catheter place within arm ( one infusion , one blood collection ) . After baseline period 30 minute , blood glucose level increase load dose dextrose follow continuous infusion achieve steady state condition . Blood sample collect every 5 minute , glucose level measure . Insulin level measure 0 , 2.5 , 5.0 , 7.5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 , 120 , 140 , 160 , 180 minute infusion . The 1st-phase insulin release sum plasma insulin concentration 2.5 , 5.0 , 7.5 10 minute . The 2nd-phase average plasma insulin concentration final hour . 3 . Endothelial-dependent vasodilation use brachial artery diameter measure ultrasound . A blood pressure cuff inflate arm supra-systolic pressure 5 minute . This result vasodilation downstream blood vessel . Following release cuff , usually 6 10-fold increase flow brachial artery , i.e. , reactive hyperemia . Flow physiologic stimulus release nitric oxide cause dilation brachial artery , hence , increase diameter brachial artery ; measure use ultrasound . The maximal increase brachial artery diameter occur one minute reactive hyperemia dilation mediate nitric oxide . Endothelium-independent vasodilation ( positive control ) assess measure brachial artery diameter basal condition 3 minute follow administration sublingual nitroglycerin ( 0.4 mg ) . Maximal brachial artery dilation occur 3 4 minute administration sublingual nitroglycerin . 4 . Central aortic blood pressure measurement : The SphygmoCor XCEL System portable machine use measure central aortic blood pressure inpatient visit ( machine FDA approve measurement central blood pressure ) . A thin pillow place subject 's arm align arm heart . A blood pressure cuff place patient 's arm , brachial artery obtain measurement . The entire procedure take approximately 10 minute perform . Coded data automatically store via SphygmoCor XCEL System download onto secure research computer storage analysis . 5 . Phlebotomy perform measure circulate melatonin , plasma renin activity , angiotensin II . These assay marker systemic renin angiotensin system . Phlebotomy also measure adiponectin , leptin , ghrelin , HbA1c . These assay marker glucose homeostasis insulin sensitivity . In addition , intravenous access place permit blood draw every 2 hour 7 pm 9 follow morning ( ie , morning day 1 ) . These nocturnal blood draw use measure nocturnal serum melatonin level . In order blood draw complete without enter subject 's room possibly wake subject , specialized circadian IV protocol use whereby antecubital IV line secure kerlix wrap connect 12 foot IV tube traverse metal window wall construct especially purposes present patient room BWH CCI . Patency IV tube night ensure infuse low dose unfractionated heparin ( approximately 200 unit per hour ) . The heparin stop IV convert standard IV approximately 9 Day 1 . This standard protocol BWH CCI measure overnight melatonin concentration . 6 . A 24-urine collected measure excretion epinephrine , norepinephrine , aldosterone . 7 . Ambulatory blood pressure ( 24 hour ) measure use standard technique employ commonly clinical practice . An ambulatory blood pressure monitor place participant 's arm participant discharge inpatient visit ; participant also instruct appropriate use , include shut monitor 24-hour period . The participant discharge inpatient visit cuff place give pre-paid FedEx mailer monitor return study coordinator data download re-use .</detailed_description>
