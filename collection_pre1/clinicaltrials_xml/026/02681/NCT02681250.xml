	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Dental Implants Titanium-zirconium Alloy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Implants use purpose replace lose teeth since 1960s . Since , treatment edentulism dental implant implement large scale . The main reason research show treatment implant predictable term implant survival . The accumulated knowledge , see 15 20 year follow-ups , base prerequisite always follow today . One implant use aforementioned study manufacture titanium good rigidity use main implant material today . In addition , study examine implant turn surface . This standard revise mid 1990s series study show increase accelerated osseous ingrowth implant moderate raw surface achieve blasting . The related biological event describe process describe detail literature . Today , material explore alternative well document implant material titanium focus find material high stiffness combine equivalent biological characteristic . A stiff material theoretically give possibility implant installation without bone augmentation case reduce bone volume . An alternative implant material reach clinic titanium-zirconium alloy . It show increased rigidity comparison titanium comparable biological characteristic documentation consist mainly animal study short term clinical follow-up form case-series . Since demonstrated choice implant material may influence osseointegration , necessary evaluate implant make titanium-zirconium clinical control study long-term follow-up emphasis put clinical outcome . Aims The aim study compare clinical outcome implant make titanium-zirconium proven implant make titanium . The scientific question project differences clinical outcome implant make titanium correspond implant titanium-zirconium alloy . Materials Methods Patients refer implant treatment Department Prosthodontics , Specialisttandvården Borås ask participate study provide write consent review deliver information sheet . Implants instal two well experienced surgeon Oral Maxillofacial Surgery att Borås Regional Hospital accord protocol use dental implant surgery recommend manufacturer . Two group , match age gender , define block randomisation smoking . The test group receive titanium-zirconium implant control group titanium implant . For power 80 % p &lt; 0.05 , ( SD = 1.66 accord previous study , estimate make 1 mm difference margin bone level group ) , size group define 44 patient per group . The investigator anticipate loss approximately 10 % therefore , investigator increase patient group 48 individual . The data collection complete number patient reach . The evaluation involve additional clinical radiological examination compare usual procedure . Normally , mean examination therapy planning , surgical examination , implant installation , impression , placement prosthetic restoration , baseline X-ray , control/follow-up tightening prosthetic screw/hygiene monitoring . No additional time cost arise connection participation study , cost group equivalent . National guideline follow regard possible need antibiotic prophylaxis . Registration do regard history periodontal disease , smoking , medication , implant position jaw . The data collection take place four different time : connection placement prosthetic construction ( baseline ) 1.3 5 year . Standard x-ray examination carry check marginal bone level take place individualize x-ray holder produce impression material ( Putty ) . Registration pocket depth , bleed probing , amount keratinize mucosa measurement x-ray do person . Prosthetic complication possible total implant loss register . The marginal bone level implant present average mesial distal bone level ( primary outcome ) . The mean value pocket depth record implant 4-point measurement . The hypothesis test independent sample t-test . The impact restoration distance bone level , effect implant type , margin bone level , bleed probe pocket depth control use regression analysis . SPSS use statistical analysis . The hypothesis difference clinical outcome two type implant . Potential benefit Project The investigator conclude material equivalent difference implant type available . Since , titanium-zirconium alloy high stiffness titan , investigator able provide patient thinner implant thus costly painful treatment optimize width bone installation area avoid . From social perspective , turn titan-zirconium equal well clinical performance titanium , unnecessary healthcare cost surgery modulation surgical site form augmentation sinus elevation associate implant treatment avoid . If optimize surgery avoid , mean even short therapy time increased availability release health time use quickly treat patient possible stand line treatment . Limits find study 's applicability general dentistry operation carry specialist clinic case patient clientele processor 's level expertise fully comparable general dentist . Research ethical consideration Treatment dental implant titanium know treatment help restore good chew function many patient year world think safe treatment high success rate . The study protocol call difference x-ray examination surgical protocol compare procedure follow regular treatment basis . In previous study , list suspect allergy titanium-zirconium alloy . Patient information storage personal data accordance recommendation Board ethical review .</detailed_description>
