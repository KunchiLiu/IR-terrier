	<brief_title>Open-Label Study To Evaluate Efficacy , Safety , Tolerability &amp; PK MN-001 HDL &amp; Triglyceride NASH &amp; NAFLD Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist Screening Phase ( 4 month ) follow Treatment Phase ( 12 week ) , Follow-up visit ( within 1 week last dose ) . A total 40 male female subject ≥18 year age plan enrol . During Screening Phase , subject assess study eligibility . After sign informed consent form , follow assessment perform : medical history include review prior current medication , physical examination include height body weight , waist circumference , vital sign electrocardiogram . Clinical lab , routine chemistry , hematology , coagulation profile , urinalysis serum pregnancy test collect well cytokeratin-18 ( CK-18 ) , biomarker NASH diagnosis . An alcohol consumption questionnaire administer MRI scan liver perform . Serum fibrosis marker , Fib-4 index ( age , AST , ALT , PLT ) NAFLD fibrosis score ( age , BMI , AST/ALT ratio , IFG/DM , PLT , Albumin ) calculate .</detailed_description>
