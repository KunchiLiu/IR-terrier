	<brief_title>Safety Potential Efficacy Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Non‚ÄêCystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase 1 investigation perform test safety two dose bone-marrow derive hMSCs ( 20,000,000 100,000,000 ) administer via peripheral intravenous infusion . Group 1 : 3 subject receive single administration allogeneic hMSCs : 20 x106 ( 20 million ) cell deliver via peripheral intravenous infusion Group 2 : 3 subject receive single administration allogeneic hMSCs : 1 x108 ( 100 million ) cell deliver via peripheral intravenous infusion Interim safety analysis perform four week 1st subject enrol cohort . Continued safety tolerability review adverse event ( AEs ) assess visit . Efficacy parameter ( pulmonary function test , lung diffusion capacity , lung volume , 6-Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) , dyspnea/Quality Life ( QOL ) questionnaires ) assess every 12 week study completion . Clinical laboratory test assess safety perform every visit . High Resolution Computed Tomography ( HRCT ) scan perform baseline visit ( do within three month prior enrollment ) week 24 .</detailed_description>
