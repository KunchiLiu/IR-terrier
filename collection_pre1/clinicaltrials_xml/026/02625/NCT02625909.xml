	<brief_summary>The aim study determine treatment recently acquire hepatitis C infection ( without HIV coinfection ) shorten treat interferon-free therapy sofosbuvir/velpatasvir ( SOF/VEL ) . SOF/VEL new treatment hepatitis C call direct act antiviral target hepatitis C virus replication cycle show phase II study chronic HCV highly effective ( SVR12 &gt; 95 % ) give 12 week . Data show treatment shorten treat recently acquire HCV interferon contain treatment . It know whether treatment SOF/VEL shorten . This study aim find treatment 6 week open-label SOF/VEL equivalent treatment 12 week SOF/VEL participant recently acquire hepatitis C infection . The project randomise study participant investigator would find treatment duration participant week 6 treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Study Interferon-free Treatment Recently Acquired Hepatitis C PWID People With HIV Coinfection .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Globally , 3-4 million new HCV infection estimate occur annually . People inject drug ( PWID ) represent one group high risk transmit acquire infection majority new ( 60 % ) existing ( 80 % ) infection develop country occur population HCV antibody prevalence estimate 67 % ( 60-80 % ) . HIV-positive men-who-have-sex-with-men ( MSM ) another high risk group HCV acquisition . Direct act antiviral ( DAA ) change treatment landscape individual chronic HCV infection interferon-free therapy offering high effectiveness tolerability , even `` difficult-to-treat '' population . Given burden HCV-related disease among PWID HIV-positive MSM , strategies enhance HCV assessment , treatment prevention group urgently need . Much known time treatment initiation , regimen choice duration therapy acute HCV infection come small observational study randomize control ( randomly assign one different treatment group ) trial select population limit data treatment PWID HIV co-infection . With recent rapid advance HCV treatment , management strategy acute HCV evolve rapidly next year . The REACT study compare efficacy safety open-label SOF/VEL administer 6 12 week individual recent HCV infection . Participants randomise receive 6 week 12 week treatment . Both investigator participant blind treatment duration week 6 treatment . The role activity DAA regimens acute HCV infection require evaluation , potential give highly effective , short course interferon-sparing regimen , maximise acceptability patient , encourage uptake treatment , limit transmission prevent progression chronic liver disease .</detailed_description>
