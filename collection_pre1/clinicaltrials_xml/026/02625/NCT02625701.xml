	<brief_summary>There ideal `` cookbook recipe '' fluid prescription would fit every surgical patient . In study , investigator work hypothesis adoption integrative algorithm perioperative fluid haemodynamic management would improve clinical outcome reduce hospital resource utilization noncardiac surgical procedure ( major-to-intermediate level stress . Two intraoperative fluid strategy compare : `` Restrictive '' vs. `` goal-directed therapy ( GDT ) '' . In GDT group , haemodynamic information obtain flow monitor device couple standard heart rate blood pressure monitoring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The rationale minimize body weight gain avoid unnecessary fluid compensation `` third compartment '' well justified achievement supra-normal oxygen delivery value likely necessary surgical patient . Therefore , would tempt adopt fluid restriction protocol give potential well wound heal , faster return bowel function shorter hospital stay major surgical procedure . Although dynamic flow index volume responsiveness validate critically-ill patient , concern raise regard risk overzealous fluid administration non-critically-ill patient undergo elective surgery . To date , RCTs compare fluid regimen ( `` liberal '' versus `` restrictive '' `` liberal '' versus `` GDT '' ) yield controversial result consensus regard appropriate fluid administration perioperative period . Interestingly , restrictive protocol associate frequent adverse event ( e.g. , nausea , vomit ) follow minor surgical procedure concern raise regard possibility tissue hypoperfusion lead end-organ dysfunction .</detailed_description>
