	<brief_summary>Lateral compression type pelvic ring injury remain common type pelvic fracture encounter . There substantial amount controversy surround treatment injury evidence operative non-operative treatment successful .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pelvis RCT : Impact Surgery Pain Lateral Compression Type Pelvic Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The crux problem determine patient would benefit early surgical stabilization heal uneventfully without surgery . Many author site patient pain inability mobilize indication surgery , although conflict evidence support claim . The presence chronic pain trauma population grow area interest , push towards control pain effectively acute setting . It remain proven surgical intervention effective decrease acute long term pain . There evidence literature support operative non-operative treatment patient LC1 LC2 pelvic fracture . There conflict evidence surgical stabilization decrease acute pain narcotic requirement , although patient often counseled effect . The investigator propose prospectively randomize patient lateral compression type pelvic fracture non-operative versus operative treatment track group less pain , less need narcotic pain medication , mobilize physical therapy faster .</detailed_description>
