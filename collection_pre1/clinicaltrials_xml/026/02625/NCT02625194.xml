	<detailed_description>Fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided intubation gold standard intubation patient anticipate difficult airway . This technique take several minute without oxygen supply , result hypoxia prolonged . If continuous supply oxygen procedure improve oxygenation , reduce risk hypoxemia increase safety margin procedure .</detailed_description>
