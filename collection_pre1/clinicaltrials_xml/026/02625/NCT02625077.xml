	<detailed_description>This prospective , interventional , double-blinded , monocenter randomize control trial compare laparoscopic gastroesophageal valvuloplasty laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication patient proven GERD maximum hiatal hernia 3cm . In design , patient researcher blind treatment allocation . Block randomization use ensure equal number treatment arm . Block randomization work randomize participant within block equal number assign treatment . To reduce selection bias predictability treatment allocation , random block size use . Also investigator keep blind size block . A computer use generate 15 block participate center random block size 4 , 8 12 . Allocation proceed randomly select one ordering assign next block participant study group accord specify sequence . Patients include two-year period follow minimum one year . When patient refer participate surgeon antireflux surgery , receive study information give sufficient time consideration . The surgeon ensure require pre-operative diagnostic test perform indication surgery valid . During follow-up visit , surgeon ascertains patient complies inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion . Study participation discuss informed consent obtain , patient include trial . After inclusion , patient immediately randomize treatment allocation yet share surgeon . The patient receive validate questionnaire record pattern symptom , quality life , medication medical care usage . Data pre-operative test record . On day surgery , surgeon able see treatment allocation perform appropriate surgical procedure , record course specific surgical procedure . Patients receive diary record meal symptom . Follow-up outpatient clinic take place surgeon 's discretion . At fixed moment : 3 , 6 12 month surgery , patient receive validated questionnaire . Also three month , follow-up manometry 24-hour pH and/or impedance monitoring perform . A power analysis perform calculate sample size . Our primary aim compare effect surgical procedure . Based upon current medical literature , objective/subjective success rate laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication around 88 % . Pilot data retrospective cohort patient underwent valvuloplasty report subjective success rate 96 % . Our hypothesis gastroesophageal valvuloplasty inferior Toupet fundoplication compare effect acid control . To prove non-inferiority valvuloplasty regard acid reflux control , use non-inferiority limit 5 % , 73 patient require group . In power calculation , significance 5 % power 90 % use . To accommodate loss follow-up 10 percent , total sample size 160 chosen .</detailed_description>
