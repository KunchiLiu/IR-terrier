	<brief_title>Real-time Decision Support Postoperative Nausea Vomiting ( PONV ) Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nausea vomit surgery ( PONV ) common side effect surgical procedure , general anesthesia opioid use occur one third patient . In addition unpleasant patient , associate longer recovery room stay increase cost . Much research do prophylactic intervention may apply surgical procedure prevent PONV . Current national guideline recommend risk score use decide number prophylactic intervention administer patient . Based specific characteristic individual patient procedure undergo , risk score predicts risk PONV individual . According national guideline , patient higher risk PONV receive prophylactic intervention . However , busy operate room anesthesia provider performs multiple patient care task , closely follow recommendation minimize risk PONV often difficult . Computers may help anesthesia provider adhere best practice PONV prevention provide so-called decision support . A decision support system PONV automatically calculate risk PONV individual patient present predict risk anesthesia provider computer screen use anesthesia team record keep . In recent study , decision support system demonstrate improve adherence PONV guideline , especially recommendation number intervention add predict risk . However , study still quite room improvement adherence PONV guideline . In general , implementation science begin understand decision support system best use improve medical decision making minimize practice variation among provider . Further study design decision support system impact decision make healthcare provider therefore warrant . In proposed study , investigator implement several decision support element PONV aim help anesthesia provider adhere departmental PONV guideline anesthetic case . It multicenter , interrupted time series study . The participate center Vanderbilt University Medical Center ( VUMC ) University Washington Medical Center ( UWMC ) . The time series consist three phase . The first phase preintervention phase - i.e . decision support implement . The second phase intervention phase impact different CDSS feature study . The third phase postintervention phase study happen guideline adherence CDSS switch . Each hospital implement three four different decision support element within intervention phase . The decision support element provide information patient 's predict risk PONV number prophylactic intervention departmental guideline recommend base risk . The VUMC start preoperative email notification , follow two element within anesthesia information management system ( AIMS ) display around start end procedure . For UWMC , three element provide automate , near real-time notification anesthesia provider include recommendation manage PONV prevention accord current guideline . During last stage notification remind anesthesia provider near end case , additional prophylactic intervention may give , depend predict risk already do prevent PONV . All form decision support provide recommendation . The anesthesia provider free act message ignore notification . The investigator compare adherence PONV guideline actual occurrence PONV ( nausea emetic event : vomit retch ) post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) study phase different intervention . The goal comparison evaluate decision support element add value optimize guideline adherence PONV prophylaxis .</detailed_description>
