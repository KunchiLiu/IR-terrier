	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Novel HALS Technique Versus Laparoscopic Technique Right Hemicolectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic colectomy first describe Jacobs early 1990s . Since , minimally invasive approach , laparoscopic surgery gain popularity colorectal resection . Compared open colectomy , laparoscopic colectomy advantage blood loss , recovery bowel function , need narcotic analgesic , hospital stay . The long-term outcome laparoscopic surgery colon cancer also prove . Complete mesocolic excision ( CME ) colon cancer reemphasized , merit provide well cancer clearance high 5 year survival rate . Recently , report patient without lymph node metastasis benefit wider mesenteric excision include many negative lymph node possible . The use D3 lymphadenectomy colon cancer state art decade Asian country . A comparison Japanese D3 resection European CME central vascular ligation ( CVL ) show series oncologically superior traditional right hemicolectomy . Most recently , consensus reach European Japanese expert radical approach combine CME D3 lymphadenectomy oncologically preferable . Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy CME D3 lymphadenectomy report feasible safe several author . However , due notorious high rate vascular variation right colon , laparoscopic right-sided CME CVL D3 resection obese patient remain challenging , even experience hand . Two major technical difficulty include identify superior mesenteric vein ( SMV ) thick layer fatty tissue dissection around middle colic vessel . Here investigator report novel technique tackle two problem combine transection bowel small incision medial lateral approach hand-assisted laparoscopic ( HAL ) surgery . The detail follow : Surgical Techniques Operation step outside abdominal cavity Under general anesthesia , patient place supine position leg split-ted . A middle incision 7 centimeter long make around umbilicus , use place Lapdisc . This procedure start transection great omentum , transverse colon distal ileum self-expandible Lapdisc . Transect transverse colon For cancer ascend colon cecum , transverse colon divide site leave right branch middle colic artery . For hepatic flexural transverse colon cancer , transverse colon divide left side middle colic artery . After transverse colon divide , two end transverse colon return abdomen . Transect distal ileum Distal ileum transect 15 25 cm ileocecal valve . After , distal end superior mesenteric vessel easily identify sever . By hold stump , dissection around superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) SMV could easily achieve advanced level duodenum . And case , ileocolic artery vein could cut origin small incision . Then , bowel return . Establish pneumoperitoneum Three trocars engage procedure : port A leave low quadrant main work port ; port B upper leave quadrant camera port ; port C slightly xiphoid use mainly retract mesocolon stomach . Next , Lapdisc place pneumoperitoneum pressure 10-12 mmHg establish . D3 lymph node dissection CME CVL The D3 lymphadenectomy mobilization colon perform intracorporeally . The course lymphadenectomy divide four step . First : Cut peritoneum SMA identify pancreatic neck The surgeon hold middle colic vessel pull mesentery ventrally finish divide mesocolon ensure direct view pancreatic neck . Open peritoneum SMA advance cephalad till pancreas expose . Second : Serving arterial branch right colon To identify arterial branch cross SMV supply right side colon , care must take take thin slice fat tissue two blade Harmonic inactive blade face SMV , take big bite tissue one time avoid involve vessel . Before deal middle colic artery , good expose dorsal edge pancreatic neck also mark anterior level SMV . Then , right colic middle colic artery identify . With help finger , much easy push forcep behind vessel apply ham-locks origin middle colic artery right colic artery . Then two artery divide . Third : Serving venous branch colon After exposure whole length SMV , middle colic vein likely show without much dissection . The middle colic vein clip divide . Then dissect along right side SMV . The ileocolic vein already divide . The right colic vein , drain SMV directly , clip divide . Then dissect along pancreatic neck . Fourth : Dissection front pancreatic head . Dissection continue cephalad , gastroepiploic vein observe dealing , pancreatic head expose . Dissection front anterior pancreatoduodenal fascia blunt dissection employ separation mesocolon Toldt 's fascia . Mobilization right colon With finger provide constantly change counter-retraction , mobilization mesocolon could carry fast precise manner . Mobilizing cecum behind mesocolon call surgeon turn hand palm facing ventrally , camera holder turn camera rod view mesocolon behind . Because vessel feed right side colon well marginal artery sever , tumor bloodless mobilization colon . Last , dissect gastrocolic ligament . For patient ascend colon cancer , gastroepiploic vessel preserve . With good retraction provide hand , mobilization mesocolon easy task medial approach dissection . Anastomosis After right colon excise , side-to-side ileocolic anastomosis create , mesenteric defect close extra-corporeally small incision . According previous study , novel HAL right hemicolectomy CME CVL technically feasible safe . This novel technique carry merit block blood supply colon mobilization tumor line `` touch isolation '' technique .</detailed_description>
