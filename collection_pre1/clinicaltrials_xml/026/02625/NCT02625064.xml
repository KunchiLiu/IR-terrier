	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) poor prognosis high mortality . To improve early diagnosis ARDS , urgent need novel biomarkers ARDS . The goal project find series novel biomarkers differential proteomic technique improve early diagnosis develop efficient therapy enhance ARDS patient survival rate . Clinical data blood sample record treatment treatment . Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation III ( APACHE III ) score calculated enrolment . Studying blood specimen different period ARDS patient proteomic analysis . It provide information complex composition protein differentially express , could use discover high sensitivity specificity ARDS biomarker .</detailed_description>
