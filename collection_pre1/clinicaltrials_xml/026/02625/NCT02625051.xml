	<brief_title>Quality Life Kidney Stone Patients Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , prevalence renal stone 8.8 % slight predomination male female . They symptomatic mark symptom flank pain , hematuria urinary tract infection , completely asymptomatic incidentally discover . Three modality accept treatment option renal stone , include shockwave lithotripsy ( SWL ) , percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PNL ) ureteroscopy ( URS ) . While standard guideline propose appropriate treatment selection regard stone size , recommendation guideline exist surgical management 1-2 cm renal stone . Both PNL URS equally accept treatment option stone size . The selection either procedure currently leave treat surgeon influence anatomical stone factor well patient preference . For URS , frequent requirement postoperative ureteral stent may result significant morbidity detriment quality life owe irritate bladder symptom cause stent . PNL rarely require postoperative ureteral stent may bring long operative time hospitalization . PNL therefore may treatment option preserve quality life compare URS patient present 1-2 cm size kidney ureteral stone . One reasonable way evaluate efficacy treatment option assess patient 's quality life resultant select modality . Quality life renal stone former important under-studied facet nephrolithiasis management incorporated clinical decision making . The short form-36 health survey questionnaire ( SF-36 ) patient-reported survey health status . It validate commonly use determine efficacy give health treatment many setting , include urologic intervention . The Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire ( USSQ ) validate widely accept instrument evaluate impact ureteral stent quality life . The investigator plan use two questionnaire standard outcome measurement compare impact quality life patient randomize undergo two different modality ( PNL versus URS ) stone treatment .</detailed_description>
