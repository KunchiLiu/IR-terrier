	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial compare two systemic treatment HER2-positive breast cancer . The treatment give either prior breast surgery ( neoadjuvant treatment ) breast surgery ( adjuvant treatment ) . In investigational group ( Group A ) study participant receive combination two drug direct HER2 ( two anti-HER2 antibody ) plus chemotherapy agent ( docetaxel ) brief duration , patient allocate comparator group ( Group B ) treat chemotherapy plus one anti-HER2 treatment ( trastuzumab ) one year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Trastuzumab , Pertuzumab Plus Docetaxel Treatment Early HER2-positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , patient diagnose HER2-positive early breast cancer randomly allocate 1:1 ratio receive either three 3-weekly cycle trastuzumab , pertuzumab docetaxel ( TPD ) total duration 9 week , follow three cycle chemotherapy ( Group A ) three 3-weekly cycle trastuzumab docetaxel ( TD ) follow three cycle chemotherapy single-agent anti-HER2 antibody treatment complete one year anti-HER2 treatment ( Group B ) . These systemic treatment may administer either prior breast surgery ( neoadjuvant treatment ) breast surgery ( adjuvant treatment ) . The study participant require histologically verified breast cancer moderate high risk breast cancer recurrence despite macroscopically complete surgery breast tumor . The moderate/high risk breast cancer recurrence define presence cancer axillary lymph node , axillary lymph node contain cancer , presence tumor large one centimeter breast . The study patient follow study treatment completion physical examination , blood test , cardiac test , whenever indicate , image . Approximately 700 patient randomly allocate two group . The study hypothesis regimen contain TPD may effective Group B treatment despite brief duration .</detailed_description>
