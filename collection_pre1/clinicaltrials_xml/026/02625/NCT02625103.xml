The role Therapeutic Drug Monitoring ( TDM ) clozapine dose adjustment debate . Blood sample s-clozapine monitoring recommend drawn 12 hour post dose . Uncertainty regard time blood sample individual pharmakokinetics clozapine +/- 2 hour 12-hour timepoint , lead uncertainty regard comparability serum concentration information hold within . The scope trial describe change s-clozapine s-N-desmethyl-clozapine within range 10-14 hour last administration clozapine . In addition want investigate follow covariates might affect change s-clozapine s-N-desmethyl-clozapine : Sex , age , BMI , co-medications , sign infection , caffeine intake smoking .</detailed_description>
