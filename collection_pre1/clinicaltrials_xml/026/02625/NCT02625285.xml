	<detailed_description>Radical cure P. vivax malaria achieve use large dos primaquine show cause degree hemolysis even subject test normal conventional qualitative G6PD test . Different regimen drug might appropriate subject intermediate G6PD activity currently measure well equipped laboratory . Validation new qualitative quantitative point-of-care test essential safe deployment standard new radical cure regimens Plasmodium vivax . This study evaluate performance quantitative POC G6PD test ( Biosensors ) gold standard quantitative laboratory base test genotyping . Patients search electronic record database identify 150 patient follow characteristic : approximately 50 G6PD-deficient men woman ( however small percent deficients homozygous woman ) approximately 50 G6PD-heterozygous woman intermediate activity , approximately 50 G6PD-normal individual patient meet screen criterion contact home clinic staff member . The home visitor explain study detail invite participate study . If patient express interest participating , direct visit follow month clinic usually receive care . After sign informed consent form , two blood sample withdraw ; one sample take finger-stick ( 200 µl ) one sample ( 0.5 ml ) take arm venipuncture . The blood capillary sample use assess G6PD activity use POC test , CBC laboratory base quantitative test . The venous blood use reference standard quantitative G6PD assay , Hb type analysis , CBC buffy-coat store DNA extraction G6PD genotyping ; leftover blood discard .</detailed_description>
