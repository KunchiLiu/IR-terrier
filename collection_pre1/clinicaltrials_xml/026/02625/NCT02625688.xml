	<brief_summary>Delayed cord clamping ( DCC ) subject extensive research last couple year . Based publish data , numerous neonatal benefit suggest increased hemoglobin ferritin level birth long term . Available systematic review DCC versus early cord clamping ( ECC ) reveal may also contribute neonatal outcome include polycythemia hyperbilirubinemia . A review publish nearly 10 year ago regard late umbilical cord clamp reveal 4 study second objective assess whether time cord clamp associate increased risk polycythemia hyperbilirubinemia first week life . Two study report neonate DCC bilirubin level &gt; 15 mg/dl . No information provide hour life bilirubin level measure exactly . In randomized control study investigator would like determine delay cord clamp cord milk labor increase risk hyperbilirubinaemia ( require phototherapy ) term infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator feel publish result regard 'jaundice '' `` jaundice need phototherapy ' ( associate DCC ) may mislead . First , information offer `` clinical jaundice `` assessed examination . The absence jaundice indication absence hyperbilirubinemia . Estimation degree hyperbilirubinemia base solely clinical examination lead error . The absence severity jaundice predictive subsequent severe hyperbilirubinemia . A recent study reveal nurse ' predischarge assessment jaundice extent moderately correlate bilirubin concentration similar black nonblack infant . A review publish nearly 10 year ago regard late umbilical cord clamp reveal 4 study secondary objective assess whether time cord clamp associate increased risk polycythemia hyperbilirubinemia first week life . Two study report neonate DCC bilirubin level &gt; 15 mg/dl . No information provide hour life bilirubin level measure exactly . Secondly , guideline treat jaundice change time none study mention threshold use administer phototherapy . No information give , staff responsible phototherapy administration blind type cord clamp intervention . Potential confounders isoimmune hemolytic disease , symptoms sepsis ( significant lethargy , temperature instability ) , asphyxia , G6PD , acidosis , albumin &lt; 3 g/L include analysis . Also another important factor feeding policy time bilirubin measurement n't mention neither study . The presence mention confounders available study lead investigator conduct blind randomized trial . Postnatal hyperbilirubinemia universal manifest newborn jaundice 60-80 % newborn . If leave untreated hyperbilirubinemia may progress excessive level associate evident bilirubin neurotoxicity . Jaundice common clinical diagnosis neonatal medicine . Elevated bilirubin concentration may occur due increase bilirubin production ( breakdown heme moiety hemoglobin ) and/or delayed bilirubin elimination ( hepatic intestinal ) well unique neonatal phenomenon enterohepatic reabsorption bilirubin . Studies show late cord clamp benefit expand beyond neonatal period . A meta -analyses estimate significant 47 % reduction risk anemia 33 % reduction risk deficient iron store age 2 3 month delay cord clamp group . These pool result base two small study , despite significant number patient lose follow ( 40 % ) , result agree large randomize trial . It important understand whether evidence base benefit DCC ( increase hemoglobin , improve iron status , decrease risk infant anemia ) may also contribute less favorable neonatal outcome . This trial aim ass delay cord clamp truly increase risk hyperbilirubinaemia require phototherapy even exchange transfusion . Dose selection : The total feto-placental blood volume 120 ml/kg fetal weight . At birth , distribution blood fetus placenta roughly ratio 2:1 . Increasing placental transfusion least three minute lead large infant blood volume ( ratio 5:1 ) .The rate placental transfusion markedly influence position deliver infant . From least 10 cm least 10 cm level placenta , infant receive maximum possible amount least three minute birth . The randomized quasi-randomized control trial study delayed cord clamp vaginally bear , healthy , term infant differ clamping time infant position clamp still consensus time require sufficient amount blood transfuse placenta baby . The mentioned trial show placental-neonate blood flow significantly increase DCC show high packed cell volume hemoglobin concentration first 24 hour birth compare immediate clamping . To test hypothesis , investigator decide delay cord clamp intervention group 3 minute place baby 10 cm placental , seem efficient base available literature . At birth ( spontaneous vaginal delivery caesarian section ) member recruitment team present . He inform midwife obstetrician allocate intervention measure time delivery shoulder cord clamp . If cord milking allocate intervention , recruiter supervise midwife , obstetrician preforming procedure , count loud number time cord milk . During vaginal delivery midwifes ask maintain infant least 10 cm uterus cord clamp . In case caesarian section baby place mother 's lap swaddle sterile towel prevent heat loss . In early cord clamp group , recruiter inform midwife obstetrician 30 second pass . In delayed clamping group , recruiter inform midwife obstetrician 3 minute . If cord milking apply baby place level placenta , mother 's thigh ( vaginal delivery ) side mother swaddle sterile towel ( caesarian delivery ) . Based available literature , start trial investigator pilot procedure [ 13 ] . They check two third umbilical cord present milk vaginal caesarian delivery . If cord milk able transfer approximately 10 ml blood neonate . Following , assumption cord vein rapidly refill , investigator assume milk cord four time give u 40 ml blood [ 13 ] . A member delivery team ( vaginal delivery ) operating team ( caesarian delivery ) hold cord level introitus cesarean wound , milk cord four time towards neonate counting loud . The cord clamp forth milking . Choice comparator In spite available study advocate delay cord clamping , still infrequently use labor ward throughout world [ 28 ] . According new guideline early cord clamping-ECC define cord clamp less 60 second delivery . The available meta-analyses compare early versus late cord clamp include study significantly vary define ECC . The majority trial define ECC clamp within first 10 second , describe ECC immediate clamping . Only one trial extend ECC long 60 second . The new 2010 ILCOR ( International Liaison Committee Resuscitation ) guideline advocate DDC , state cord clamp delay least 1 min complete delivery baby . Investigators choose definition , ILCOR committee provide international consensus evidence base guideline emergency care , widely accept among neonatologist throughout world . ECC part active management labour . Active management usually involve clinician intervene process three interrelate process : administration prophylactic uterotonic drug ; cord clamp cut â‰¤60 second delivery ; control traction umbilical cord . These intervention aim reduction risk postpartum haemorrhage . However , ECC eliminate possibility additional blood flow placenta newborn , deprive baby numerous profit receive extra amount iron . This potential additional amount iron prevents iron deficiency first year life infant bear delay cord clamp . Research Hypothesis Neither delay cord clamping cord milk labor increase significantly risk hyperbilirubinaemia comparison early cord clamping . Description trial design The trail design randomize control , observer blind trial 3 parallel group primary endpoint hyperbilirubinemia require phototherapy . Randomization perform block randomization 1:1:1 allocation . The experiment design demonstrate non-inferiority delay cord clamp cord milk group comparison early cord clamp group regard incidence bilirubinemia treat phototherapy neonate . Description study settings The study carry Princess Anne 's Hospital Warsaw , Poland . This level III teach hospital approximately 3500 ( 1000 &lt; 37 week gestation ) delivery per year 63 neonatal bed . It also referral center gestational pre-gestational diabetes well pregnancy induce hypertension . Having access high risk mother augment population small gestation infant ( SGA ) , infant diabetic mother ( IDM ) study . SGA IDM increase risk hyperbilirubinemia , thus presence patient improve generalizability study population . The local protocol cord clamp yet adjust new ILCOR guideline , labour ward staff willing implement new procedure . This improve trail recruitment adherence .</detailed_description>
