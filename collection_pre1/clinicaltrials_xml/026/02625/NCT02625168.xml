	<detailed_description>Study background The investigator prospectively evaluate use afatinib 3rd 4th line treatment progression one line first-generation EGFR-TKI therapy least one line systemic chemotherapy CUP . All patient document EGFR activate mutation start afatinib . Determination EGFR mutation analysis patient describe previously . Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor biopsy start 1st TKI therapy retrieve . Briefly , tumor enrichment perform micro-dissection light microscopy . Genomic DNA extract use QIAmp DNA FFPE Tissue kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) , follow polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification EGFR exons 18 21 use intron-based primer sequence forward reverse direction . Study population Patients EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC prior document objective response first-generation TKI ( gefitinib erlotinib ) 6 month prior treatment least 1 line systemic chemotherapy eligible join CUP offer Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma GmbH , Ingelheim , Germany . Patients receive anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody previous course treatment , either alone combination systemic chemotherapy allow join CUP . They baseline compute tomography scan brain , thorax abdomen least 1 evaluable lesion adequate serum hematological , hepatic renal function define LUX-Lung1 study . Treatment The treating physician decide start dose afatinib either 50 mg , 40 mg 30 mg daily continuously . After commencement afatinib , regular clinical follow every 2 week 4 week every 4 week permanent discontinuation afatinib death . They also regular image CT scan every 8-10 week tumor response evaluation Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 [ 16 ] . Treatment interruption need develop grade &gt; = 3 adverse event return grade 1 less . Then afatinib could resume one low dose level . Those receive afatinib 30 mg daily initial start dose would discontinue afatinib permanently develop grade &gt; =3 event . Assessment efficacy treatment-related toxicity All treatment-related toxicity collect grade accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . Objective response ( OR ) include complete response partial response disease control ( DC ) include complete response , partial response stable disease accord RECIST 1.1 . Survival outcome include progression-free survival ( PFS , define time start afatinib first date objectively determine progressive disease death cause ) overall survival ( OS , time start afatinib date death cause ) . Time progression ( TTP ) start date afatinib commencement date objectively determine progressive disease . All parameter receive afatinib study compare historical cohort patient receive erlotinib prior failure gefitinib least one line systemic chemotherapy . All patient historical cohort receive erlotinib 150 mg daily , treatment response evaluation , survival toxicity assessment receive afatinib . Statistical analysis Mann-Whitney U use comparison non-parametric variable chi-square test perform discrete variable . Kaplan-Meier method log-rank test employ comparison survival outcomes Cox proportional hazard model use prognostic factor PFS afatinib erlotinib univariate multivariate analysis , afatinib versus erlotinib , age , sex , performance status , smoke status , histology , TTP 1st TKI therapy , time interval 1st TKI afatinib erlotinib , TTP line prior chemotherapy , time interval last chemotherapy afatinib erlotinib covariates . All statistical analysis perform Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 20 .</detailed_description>
