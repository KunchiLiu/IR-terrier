	<brief_title>Free Fall Acrobatics Reduce Neck Loads During Parachute Opening Shock : Evaluation Intervention .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated neck pain prevalence among skydiver associate exposure repeat parachute opening . The parachute opening shock ( POS ) sudden brutal deceleration human . In skydive ( sport parachute aircraft ) , slow free fall skydiver velocity &gt; 200 km/h &lt; 30 km/h within second . POS deceleration magnitudes 9-12 time Earth 's gravitational acceleration ( dimensionless ratio denote G ) measured.⁠ These hard opening painful , number hard opening generate injury visible health care systems.⁠ During subjectively normal opening , deceleration measure human neck exceed 4 G initial onset rate ( jerk ) exceed 20 G/s . Considering active skydiver may ten jump per day may accumulate well thousand jump parachute career , problematic value . Fighter pilot suffer neck pain less accelerative exposure . In Swedish skydive population , neck pain prevalence 45 % , compare general population estimate 37 % . Recently publish data show skydiver neck muscle excessive strain POS , ⁠ data group suggest POS compose biomechanically discrete phase . A first phase contain initial jerk ventral dorsal direction , i.e . `` pull backwards '' , denote negative Gx , skydiver rapidly rotate prone belly-to-earth body position upright position . During phase , moment arm center mass head parachute connection point shoulder long likely yield high torque neck . The second phase , denote positive Gz , contain bulk POS-deceleration direct caudally cranially . Entering second phase neck flex forward jerk would put neck muscle clear disadvantage . In sport , would seem desirable prevent injury way sport practice . A number technique reduce POS neck load suggest among athlete , two biomechanically appeal : Reducing parachute deployment airspeed position human body head high prior main parachute extraction . Whether technique actually reduce neck load POS systematically evaluate . From empirically determine relation maximum POS deceleration free fall velocity , ⁠ calculate decrease velocity 220 km/h 190 km/h may reduce maximum deceleration thereby ( constant mass ) force 25 % . Such velocity reduction possible use human body . Our static anthropometrical assessment suggest , unless flexion forward head occurs , pitch body head high angle 45 degree flat-belly-to-relative-wind plane may reduce head-neck lever arm 30 % . Thus , successful combination velocity reduction head-neck lever arm reduction hold promise approximately halved torque neck POS . Such substantial mechanical change hypothesize biological effect . The intervention protocol base observational data static anthropometrical calculation inspire anecdotal information . It systematically validate subject matter expert , result validation publish . The intervention conceive combination velocity reduction head-neck lever arm reduction , main outcome variable magnitude deceleration jerk , express G G/s , respectively , research subject experience skydiver complete two consecutive skydives day random order ( one control jump one intervention jump ) . Based estimate real-world 30 % effect size desire 0.9 power level , sample size calculation suggest 16 subject sufficient parametric analysis . To allow dropout , sample size increase 20 subject . Thus , twenty highly experienced skydiver recruit study , perform two consecutive terminal velocity skydives day . Their demographic background data obtain use validated web-based questionnaire skydiver . The test subject recruit electronic forum , include e-mail list , highly experienced skydiver . They use sport parachute system pack maintain . The rationale maintain typical comfortable condition subject , whereas unfamiliar system may introduce undesired psychomotor confounders , also maintain high degree external validity ( compare use one type standardize parachute ) . A detailed description plan measure instrumentation publish separately . The equipment setup entirety approve aerial use National Safety Officer Swedish Parachute Association . Multiple triaxial accelerometer use measure deceleration jerk , videography record complex movement , include parachute open head motion . Altitude fall speed data collect barometric Global Positioning System ( GPS ) altimetry , use state-of-the-art skydiving device . Two consecutive skydives 4000 altitude complete subject day ; one control jump one intervention jump . For safety reason , main parachute terminal velocity deployment altitude elevate normal high-speed landing forbidden . In one two skydives , test subject perform intervention consist sequence free fall manoeuvre perform use human body : A free fall velocity reduction prior main parachute deployment follow head high body attitude prior main parachute extraction . Details manoeuvre give test subject write instruction . This study use cross-over , within-subject , repeated measure design random order perform intervention jump `` ordinary '' jump first jump two . Computerized randomization performed block , i.e . equal number subject start intervention jump vs. control jump block every four subject . A detailed description plan methodology treatment analysis data publish separately . Repeated within group measure ANOVA plan use measure effect , regression use test relationship . The result study expect contribute basis future prevention neck pain among skydiver , know relation repeat parachute opening exposure . In work address health problem , study may create logical fork important future implication . From static biomechanics theoretical calculation , plan intervention hold promise halve torque neck parachute opening . Though real-world result may show impressive effect , important examine assumption ; demonstrate merit , large-scale population study implementation would seem warrant , possibly offer elegant solution widespread health problem population . If , hand , plan intervention demonstrate little effect biomechanical outcome variable , doubt cast upon conventional wisdom skydiver good advice upon base , shift future attention pointedly towards manufacturer parachute system . This study conduct Swedish airspace cooperation supervision National Safety Officer Swedish Parachute Association . All safety resource sport parachute available within Swedish Parachute Association employ . This study conduct compliance Declaration Helsinki . All subject receive oral write information study , include safety aspect ( e.g. , agree perform high-speed landing study ) , sign write consent participate . All subject inform end study participation time .</detailed_description>
