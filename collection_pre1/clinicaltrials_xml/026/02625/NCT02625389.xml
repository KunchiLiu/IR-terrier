	<brief_summary>This study multicenter ( 10 site India ) phase IV Post-Marketing Study . The study design investigate safety Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid association surgical glue use accord site medical practice vascular embolization . Subjects enrol main condition procedure vascular embolization use Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid association surgical glue part therapeutic/palliative strategy disease . The vascular embolization use Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid association surgical glue administer study procedure . According patient need health status second vascular embolization use Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid association surgical glue may consider investigator within next 30 day first one . In case , procedure consider second study procedure . The per-procedure safety evaluation enable appropriate record safety event time frame procedure vascular embolization use Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid association surgical glue . Safety evaluation complete safety record within 30 +/-3 day embolization procedure . Efficacy evaluation rely level lesion ( ) obliteration embolization compare pre-procedural target level obliteration . Exploratory descriptive statistical method use evaluate safety efficacy , use total population subset subject similar clinical condition .</brief_summary>
