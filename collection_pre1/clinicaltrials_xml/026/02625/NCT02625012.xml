	<detailed_description>Vitiligo common acquire depigmented disorder skin characterize destruction melanocyte , result well-circumscribed achromic macule . Its etiology fully recognize functional melanocyte may disappear autoimmune response , oxidative stress induces melanocytes apoptosis , loss cell-cell adhesion melanocytes keratinocytes . Ultraviolet phototherapy narrow band ( UVB-NB ) currently one treatment choice average response rate 60-70 % lesion . UVB-NB phototherapy may induce immune regulation melanogenic induction . It also able induce Treg cell proliferation suppress autoimmune response destroy melanocyte . By hand , UVB-NB induces signal proliferation , differentiation , maturation migration melanocyte , play important role vitiligo re-pigmentation . Phosphorylation focal adhesion kinase ( p-FAK125 ) cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase play important component signal transduction cell migration , modulate cytoskeletal protein necessary movement . UVB-NB radiation induces migration melanocytes culture increase level p-FAK125 propose melanocyte migration marker . C-kit tyrosine kinase receptor express melanoblast differentiate melanocyte . Ligand bind induces PI3K , MAPK Src kinase pathways , traduce differentiation melanoblast proliferate melanocyte ; expression imply presence mature pigment melanocyte . C-kit increase mature melanocyte UVB exposure , show melanoma case loss c-kit expression involve cancer progression , therefore c-kit signaling also associate migratory process . Although , different report establish expression marker vitiligo , define marker repigmentation pattern induces UVB radiation . UVB radiation induces repigmentation distinctive pattern follicular , marginal , diffuse . Follicular pattern predominant , come hair follicle melanocyte . In marginal pattern melanocytes healthy skin attract lesion . In diffuse pattern UVB radiation stimulates inactive melanocyte . In contrast , achromic pattern induces melanocyte activation . The relation biological behavior melanocyte repigmentation pattern , may provide insight improve method treat vitiligo . The aim study observe dynamic migration proliferation specific marker repigmentation pattern vitiligo patient UVB radiation phototherapy .</detailed_description>
