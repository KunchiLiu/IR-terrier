	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness sustain peripheral nerve stimulation couple functional motor training , improve hand motor function poorly recover stroke patient . The central hypothesis stroke patient severe motor deficit receive hand nerve stimulation intensive task-oriented therapy improve motor function compare patient receive sham nerve stimulation task-oriented therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Plasticity Stroke Patients With Severe Motor Deficit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke one devastate prevalent disease , effort limit amount tissue damage acute phase disappointing , highlight need effective therapeutic intervention neurologic damage occur . Data animal human model suggest sensory input play important role motor output , possibly influence cortical plasticity . However , spite advance date , little known extent sensory input form peripheral nerve stimulation successfully combined physical training especially poorly recover stroke patient . This study evaluate effectiveness sustain peripheral nerve stimulation couple functional motor training , improve hand motor function stroke patient severe motor deficit . The central hypothesis stroke patient severe motor deficit receive hand nerve stimulation intensive task-oriented therapy improve motor function compare patient receive sham nerve stimulation task-oriented therapy , degree behaviorally-measured effect correlate neurophysiological effect measure transcranial magnetic stimulation .</detailed_description>
