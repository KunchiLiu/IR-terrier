	<detailed_description>Parallel oppose portal external beam radiation standard nonsurgical treatment T1-2N0 glottic cancer . This technique involve treatment entire larynx tumor small limited . Although technological advance allow radiation oncologist selectively target avoid adjacent sub-portions organ , tool apply T1-2N0 glottic cancer due perceive low toxicity standard therapy . However , radiotherapy early glottic cancer without functional side effect know whether post-treatment function whole larynx radiation superior target surgical approach . This phase II study treat unilateral glottic cancer ( Stage T1a T2aN0 ) intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) . In view anticipate small volume disease presentation need limit potential `` marginal miss '' , treatment include entire involved vocal fold , anterior commissure , anterior 1/3 contralateral vocal fold thus spar contralateral arytenoid cartilage musculature ( `` contralateral arytenoid spar IMRT '' ) . In addition , propose perform sophisticated objective patient report measure regard speech outcomes two year completion therapy specify interval , good gain understanding effect therapy . Our finding potential dramatically advance field early larynx cancer therapy demonstrate efficacy limiting volume uninvolved larynx receives radiation comprehensively assess functional outcome say therapy .</detailed_description>
