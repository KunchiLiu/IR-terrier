Thus , large number study investigate clinical effect tDCS perform statistically significant effect moderate clinical relevance . Clinical study mainly focus prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) main stimulation target base finding numerous study indicate lateral PFC key dysfunctional node within brain network involve pathophysiology depression . Studies clinical healthy participant indicate tDCS capable positively augment prefrontal function relevant successful cognitive behavioral therapy . More specifically , show tDCS capable improve reappraisal strategy well use cognitive control technique . To date , previous study mainly address global antidepressant effect tDCS effect circumscribe phenotype mediate top-down PFC process impair biased emotional learning process . All trial apply stimulation patient rest position . Nonetheless , recent neuropsychological study indicate tDCS effect appear `` activity dependent '' , mean stimulation effect great brain region stimulate simultaneously engage cognitive task . Therefore , present study apply tDCS patient unipolar major depressive disorder cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , well-established highly effective psychotherapeutic treatment depression .</detailed_description>
