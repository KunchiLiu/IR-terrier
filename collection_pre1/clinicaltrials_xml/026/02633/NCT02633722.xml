	<brief_summary>Obesity serious medical condition , adverse consequence include increase risk cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , reduce fertility cancer . The economic cost obesity place $ 58 billion dollar Australia 2008 . Studies mice non-human primate show moderate caloric restriction ( CR ) increase lifespan reduces incidence cardiovascular disease , cancer , type 2 diabetes . Reduced risk chronic disease also observe human follow CR . However , daily CR difficult maintain long term , since body defends weight loss induce `` metabolic adaptation '' alter hormonal appetite response . An emerge number study examine effect limit food intake prescribed time period per day , every day . Intermittent , time restrict feed describes diet approach food available ad libitum , however limited period time ( i.e . 3-12 hour ) . This study examine effect fast 15h/day eat 9-h per day glycemic control metabolic health . This study build exist knowledge base humans whether meal timing , rather caloric restriction per se , important provide stimulus require improve metabolic health reduce risk chronic disease . Moreover , examine whether restrict feed later day less benefit health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Fasting Metabolic Health , Does Meal Timing Matter ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The timing meal intake distribute across wake cycle may play role body weight regulation metabolic health human . However , limited number study interrogate human . Epidemiological evidence show individual report consume daily energy intake even meal overweight , report consumed energy intake lunch . Similarly , eat lunch late day ( 15:00 hr ) predictive poor weight loss 20-week dietary intervention study individual randomize consume calorie breakfast great weight loss versus randomize eat calorie dinner 12 week . Taken together data suggest consuming calorie morning may beneficial weight management . Randomised control cross-over intervention , lean individual instruct either consume calorie require weight maintenance 4 hour period 1700-2100h , 3 meals/d 8 week . Significant reduction body weight body fat mass , 1.4 2.1 kg respectively , note follow TRF protocol . Consumption even meal supervise within laboratory , ensure subject consume entire meal . In light evidence rat switch nibble diet 1 meal/d increase gluconeogenesis free fatty acid flux fat depot , author postulate great weight loss may associate change metabolism . Despite small amount weight loss , fast blood glucose level increase , TRF result poor glucose tolerance response oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . Thus , consume single , large `` dinner '' meal detrimental metabolic health , although difference insulinemia note . It unclear whether response may differ food allowance prescribe breakfast lunch time . Just one study perform randomise control TRF protocol human . In study , healthy , lean male subject allow eat ad libitum 13h per day ( 6am-7pm ) 2 week . Participants report eat significantly less TRF versus control condition , lose -0.4kg compare gain +0.6kg control condition . Whilst minor change body weight , pattern atypical modern eating pattern , restriction eat time , assessment obese individual condition warrant . The metabolic health impact report study . Several study animal show , feed `` wrong '' phase ( i.e . eat animal would normally rest ) mouse become obese , despite similar energy intake expenditure , suggest time food intake important drive obese phenotype . Moreover , high-fat energy intake restrict active phase , animals become obese , develop metabolic sequela observe food provide inactive phase . In human , shift worker higher risk metabolic disorder , include obesity type 2 diabetes , possibly result clock desynchronization . Alternatively , may result mis-timing meal . For example , epidemiological evidence suggest shift toward consume calorie night likely result overweight compare breakfast eater , eat great proportion calorie dinner meal associate high overall intake increase risk obesity , metabolic syndrome non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . When 10 healthy adult subject 28 hour `` day '' consume 4 isocaloric meal , result circadian misalignment associate increase blood glucose , even presence increase insulin . Moreover , 3 subject , postprandial glucose response observe would suggest pre-diabetic state . Under circumstance , appear consume calorie `` night '' human may deleterious effect health , suggest meal timing may play key role mitigate metabolic impairment occur circadian rhythm disrupt . To confuse matter , among breakfast skipper , high eat frequency ( i.e . â‰¥ 4 eat occasion per day ) show associate high risk type 2 diabetes , compare breakfast eater consume 1-3 meal per day . In light evidence , apparent beneficial effect TRF metabolic health , importance morning meal synchronisation circadian rhythm unclear . Screening ( S ) - Participants attend South Australian Health Medical Research Institute ( SAHMRI ) research protocol explain detail . Informed consent participate study , include verbal indication understand general study protocol requirement obtain . Participants assess screen questionnaire diet , medical , exercise history determine eligibility accord criterion . Routine clinical check perform ( weight , height , waist circumference , blood pressure ) . If subject meet eligibility criterion , invite take part study . Participants dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan fit continuous glucose monitor one week . During time , participant also wear accelerometer complete diet diary complete baseline assessment meal intake pattern . Participants randomly assign undergo one two study arm ( TRF-b TRF-d ) one week . Conditions separate 2-week washout period , participant encourage maintain usual dietary pattern physical activity level . Metabolic Testing ( D0 , D7 ) study condition : Participants arrive 0700 follow overnight fast . Weight blood pressure measure follow seat 10 min rest . A 20 G cannula insert antecubital vein . A fasting blood sample drawn lipid , cytokine glucoregulatory hormone . Resting metabolic rate whole body nutrient oxidation measure via indirect calorimetry . A second fasting blood sample take immediately prior standard test meal 0800am 1200pm , depend study condition gastric emptying , postprandial glucoregulatory gut hormone response re-feeding test 3 hour . At first metabolic visit study condition , participant fit continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) , follow assign TRF protocol assessment CGM continue 7 day , return D7 metabolic visit . Diet record take accelerometer wear upper arm period study .</detailed_description>
