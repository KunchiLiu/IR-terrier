	<brief_summary>Obesity metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) rapidly grow problem . Individuals MetS risk future chronic disease , high prevalence neuropathy , include cardiac autonomic neuropathy , high incidence fall . Currently effective therapy prevent reverse neuropathy see MetS reduce fall risk population . This research project determine tailor balance exercise program functional benefit result reduce fall risk grow population patient MetS neuropathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>55 participant evidence MetS autonomic neuropathy assess fall risk Four Square Step Test ( FSST ) , measure dynamic standing balance . Additional endpoint include dynamic gait index . Measures height , weight , waist circumference take oral glucose tolerance test well lipids blood pressure also measure . Autonomic function measure use cardiac autonomic testing , quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test tilt table test . Participants randomize either standard care group receive fall risk education target balance exercise intervention group . Both group meet week . The intervention group receive 12 week balance program personalize incremental increase amount difficulty maneuver .</detailed_description>
