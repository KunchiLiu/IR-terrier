	<brief_summary>So-called type 1 2 uterine fibroid well treatable Magnetic Resonance guide High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( MR-HIFU ) . The type , type 3 fibroid , however , know high perfusion poor treatment outcome MR-HIFU . This study propose new strategy treat type 3 fibroid MR-HIFU . Very precise , small , high-power sonications ( heat point ) use occlude ( part ) feeding vessel fibroid . This deminishes negative effect high perfusion hypothesize transform type 3 fibroid type 2 possibly even type 1 fibroid . Consequently , bulk volume fibroid treat use standard approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Vessel Ablation Type 3 Uterine Fibroids With Magnetic Resonance Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Uterine fibroid leiomyomas common benign tumor arise smooth muscle cell uterus prevalence range 20 % 40 % reproductive age woman . Invasive treatment , hysterectomy myomectomy , represent golden standard respect therapy . Alternatively , uterine artery embolization offer less invasive option . However , date non-invasive technique high intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) ablation . HIFU ablation us focus ultrasound wave non-invasively heat thermally ablate tissue . Combined magnetic resonance guidance ( MR-HIFU ) allow entirely non-invasive intervention anatomical 3D image plan treatment volume , real-time temperature monitoring therapeutic guidance . A limitation MR-HIFU currently type uterine fibroid treatable . With respect MR-HIFU treatment , uterine fibroid classify three class base signal intensity T2-weighted MR image . While MR-HIFU show result reliable positive therapeutic outcome type 1 type 2 fibroid , therapeutic success type 3 fibroid far limited . The current clinical consensus high perfusion type 3 fibroid , cause heat deposit HIFU rapidly evacuate treatment site , result insufficient temperature induce necrosis fibroid . Therefore , new treatment strategy propose effectively treat type 3 fibroid MR-HIFU . Objective : To investigate whether possible manipulate perfusion type 3 fibroid MR-HIFU . Study design : Single-center , single arm , non-randomized trial . Ten patient treat . Study population : Adult woman type 3 uterine fibroid fulfill in- exclusion criterion . Intervention : During MR-HIFU treatment , local vascular feeding network selectively target first high power sonications intention reduce interrupt perfusion entire fibroid volume . Subsequently , remain fibroid volume ablate , similar treatment approach type 1/2 fibroid . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The fibroid type eligibility MR-HIFU treatment determine clinically obtain MRI scan . The result scan information study provide patient phone call . If patient interested , study information send mail . The patient receives second phone call ask wish participate . If , appointment hospital arrange give detail study , answer question , show clinical MR scan . If patient still want participate , inform consent ( IC ) sign . The HIFU treatment schedule consultation patient . Patients sedate HIFU intervention , also case standard HIFU treatment type 1/2 fibroid . Compared standard HIFU treatment , initial selective ablation vascular feeding network high power sonications add . The subsequent therapy remainder fibroid follow standard therapeutic HIFU treatment type 1/2 fibroid . One week treatment patient receive phone call ask adverse event . Three month treatment follow-up MR scan , include DCE scan , perform . In addition , patient ask adverse event might occur phone call . Potential adverse effect include skin burn due heat cutaneous sub-cutaneous abdominal fat risk abdominal pain due occlusion vascular network . To mitigate risk skin burn , cool cushion integrate HIFU table top protect skin part abdominal fat overheat . If woman type 3 fibroid want participate study , eligible MR-HIFU treatment refer gynecologist invasive treatment option like uterine artery embolization hysterectomy .</detailed_description>
