	<detailed_description>Background Child Maltreatment Tanzania Child maltreatment childhood adversity often occur many low- middle-income country rate higher high-income country - rate often exceed 50 % . In Tanzania , national survey examine violence child ( VAC ) find almost 73.5 % female 71.7 % male age 13 24 experienced physical violence prior age 18 . Furthermore , 23.6 % female 27.5 % male experience emotional violence adult childhood , 27.9 % female 13.4 % male experience form sexual violence age 18 year . In addition , survey identify overlap among physical , emotional , sexual violence child . Approximately 80 % respondent experience sexual violence also experience physical violence child , nearly child experience physical violence also experience emotional violence . The VAC study also find parent adult relative commonly report perpetrator physical emotional violence child , corporal punishment consider social norm . Recent advance neuroscience , genomics , developmental psychology , epidemiology , economics shed light long-term far-reaching consequence childhood adversity , many , like child maltreatment , directly relate poor parenting . These consequence include serious physical mental health problem later life , well difficulty school , job , relationship . Child maltreatment substantial intergenerational effect parent experience maltreatment childhood vulnerable risk maltreat child . Child maltreatment also risk factor later intimate partner violence , increase risk HIV-infection , transactional sex amongst AIDS-affected youth . Furthermore , child maltreatment serious public health human right issue , come economic cost due expense relate treatment victim ' health problem , criminal justice welfare cost , low economic productivity . The risk factor child maltreatment best understood use ecological framework . A recent review 23 quantitative study Africa Meinck et al identify number child , family , social risk factor child maltreatment . Child factor associate increased likelihood physical abuse include young child , boy , child disability chronic illness , child behaviour problem , school non-attendance poor performance . Family-level factor include caregiver chronic illness , HIV/AIDS , caregiver mental health problem , caregiver disability , domestic violence , substance abuse , poor family functioning , inconsistent parenting . Finally , household poverty low socioeconomic status find major factor increase risk child abuse , well indirectly increase family stress reduce parental involvement . Parenting Programmes Prevent Child Maltreatment Parenting programme show particular promise prevent child maltreatment childhood adversity avert many life-long negative consequence child society . A recent meta-analysis report parenting program successfully reduce substantiate self-reported child maltreatment report reduce potential child maltreatment , high middle-income country . Often group-based , programme typically aim strengthen caregiver-child relationship play praise , help parent manage child 's behaviour effective , age-appropriate , positive discipline strategy . However , almost evidence effectiveness come high-income country often cost many thousand dollar per family serve . They thus prohibitively expensive government NGOs low- middle-income country . Furthermore , license-holders reluctant implement setting due perceive lack requisite infrastructure train personnel . In sum , currently parent programme evidence-based affordable low- middle-income country ( LMIC ) , need great . Economic Strengthening Programmes Household poverty also identify risk factor parental psychological distress depression well physical emotional child abuse . Consequently , addition improve parent behaviour , order reduce risk child maltreatment , may necessary address issue poverty economic strengthening programme . These programme include micro-financing , conditional unconditional cash transfer , agricultural intervention provide skill train , credit loan , access market . However , still little empirical evidence benefit integrate approach economic strengthening parent intervention . It may sufficient provide parent management train alone key mechanism change improve parent-child relationship reduce risk child maltreatment . For instance , recent meta-analysis Leijten et al find parent program equally effective socioeconomically disadvantaged family comparison non-disadvantaged family . On hand , evidence suggest family require additional support address social risk factor include poverty material hardship . Furthermore , economic strengthening program may fact harm child combine adequate child protection . Other research East Africa indicate linkage economic strengthening program child wellbeing , well importance integrate intervention psychosocial support . Nevertheless , research need understand role economic strengthening program parent management training reduce risk child maltreatment , well utility use combine approach . Study Aims Design This study aim contribute literature prevention reduction child maltreatment northern Tanzania . It evaluate ICS 's community-based intervention model combine Agribusiness Skilful Parenting train use pilot cluster randomize controlled trial design ( cRCT ) order test intervention feasibility , acceptability , preliminary efficacy . It enable u conduct process rigorous outcome evaluation use mixed-methods approach qualitative focus group in-depth interview combine quantitative implementation data self-report questionnaire . This pilot cRCT randomly allocate 8 village ( 16 farmer group , 2 farmer group per village , 240 family , 20 family per farmer group ) follow four allocation group ( 2 village per allocation group ) : 1 . Agribusiness 2 . Skilful Parenting 3 . Agribusiness plus Skilful Parenting 4 . One-year wait-list control For village allocate Agribusiness , Skilful Parenting , and/or wait-list control group , participate farmer group family opportunity participate intervention component final follow-up data assessment ( 1-year baseline ) provide analysis result indicate harmful effect . This study examine preliminary intervention effect compare intervention arm wait-list control group well among active arm ( Proschan , 1999 ) . Although focus effect economic strengthening combine parent program reduce risk child maltreatment improve child wellbeing , investigator also examine potential benefit Skilful Parenting Agribusiness program deliver separately comparison control . This study qualitatively quantitatively examine intervention effect parent-child interaction child behaviour across developmental spectrum . This include ( 1 ) parent ' report interaction select child age 3 17 , ( 2 ) child report parent-child interaction , child mental health , child behaviour family child age 10 16 , ( 3 ) early childhood development assessment family child age 0 3 . The investigator also examine feasibility ( acceptability , implementation , participation ) Agribusiness Skilful Parenting intervention .

The investigator use descriptive psychometric scale measure family socioeconomic status , parent-child interaction ( include child maltreatment harsh parenting ) , parent mental health , child depression behaviour , early child development stimulation , child biometric data . Quantitative data collection include parent report assessment family child age 3 17 , child report assessment family child age 10 16 , early childhood development assessment family child age 0 3 . As result , participate family maximum 3 assessment per data collection stage . Qualitative data collect multiple source use focus group in-depth interview strengthen reliability result : participate parent co-parents , child , facilitator . Focus group ( n=4 ) participate family intervention arm occur local community center immediate post-test . In-depth interview take place participant ' home target selection participate parent , co-parents , child ( age 10-16 ) immediate post-test . In addition , focus group conduct program facilitator ( n=8 ) immediate post-test . Additional data collect participant drop programme low attendance rate examine barrier participation . Quantitative process data collect use trained staff responsible monitoring programme facilitator . Weekly facilitator fidelity checklist administer session Skillful Parenting . Research staff also collect data participant enrolment , participation , engagement use attendance register client satisfaction survey administered end program completion . This allow u quantitatively examine predictor programme enrolment , participation , dropout well potential risk factor withdrawal intervention .</detailed_description>
