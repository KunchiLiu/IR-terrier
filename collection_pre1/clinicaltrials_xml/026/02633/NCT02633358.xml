	<brief_summary>Acute myocardial infarction complicate cardiogenic shock trigger IL-6 , strong inflammatory response , result multiple organ failure , even death . While therapeutic hypothermia , expect possibility anti-inflammatory effect via IL-6 bi-phasic effect IL-10 , improve multiple organ failure , increase survival rate well cerebral performance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-inflammatory Effect Therapeutic Hypothermia Acute Myocardial Infarction Complicated With Cardiogenic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite emergency coronary revascularization couple medical stabilization , intra-aortic balloon pump significantly improve survival patient cardiogenic shock complicate acute myocardial infarction , mortality still remain excessively high , actually 30-50 % . Future research focus new therapeutic strategy , aim decrease mortality rate patient improve possible hospitalization prognosis . Heart pump failure result cardiogenic shock . Increased LA fill pressure result acute pulmonary edema , hypoxemic respiratory failure , even congestive kidney congestive liver . Decreased stroke volume result hypoperfusion obviously direct induce acute renal failure , disturbance consciousness lactate accumulation , even , shock liver . Multiple organ failure major mortality patient suffer cardiogenic shock acute myocardial infarction . Cardiogenic shock remain leading cause death patient hospitalize myocardial infarction . Systemic inflammation , especially endovascular Interleukin-6 , trigger Tumor necrosis factor-alfa Interleukin-1 beta result inappropriate vasodilatation observe many patient cardiogenic shock may contribute excess mortality rate . In recent study , interleukin-6 represent reliable independent early prognostic marker 30-day mortality . Therapeutic hypothermia ( 34℃ ) increase stroke volume , reduce muscle oxygen consumption enhance anti-inflammatory action . The mechanism anti-inflammatory effect therapeutic hypothermia cardiogenic shock still unclear , need study clinical trial . Furthermore , study provide new strategy increase survival rate cardiogenic shock .</detailed_description>
