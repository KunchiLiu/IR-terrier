	<detailed_description>High Resolution Anorectal Manometry ( HR-ARM ) data present pressure topography recent addition test available diagnosis defecatory disorder include fecal incontinence constipation.HR-ARM represent advance conventional manometry closely spaced sensor across anal sphincter remove need pull-through procedure facilitate data acquisition interpretation . In particular measurement confound change position catheter relative anal sphincter occur voluntary contraction , especially , simulated defecation . Notwithstanding technological improvement , important concern remain validity manometry measurement simulate defecation . These concern base observation conventional HR-ARM large proportion healthy individual appear abnormal anorectal function ( `` dyssynergia '' ) simulate defecation.This limitation lead recommendation find dyssynergia manometry confirm defecography . This unsatisfactory diagnostic test high rate `` false positive '' also increase time cost need complete diagnostic investigation patient defecatory disorder . The high rate abnormal finding healthy individual may current manometry procedure anorectal test ( e.g . rectal balloon expulsion ) usually perform , upright , seat position ( USP ) usually adopt defecation , un-physiological leave lateral position ( LLP ) . Several factor may contribute . First , defecation LLP aid gravity sit position . Second , anorectal anatomy may alter less conducive passage stool LLP . Third , simulate defecation LLP reflect normal behavior , despite optimal interaction explanation investigator , change patient behavior may result apparent `` dyssynergia '' Finally , social stress , relate proximity investigator observe defecation , make individual feel unable strain stool attempt defecation . A simple probe holder device , adhere skin position natal cleft support ManoScan HR ARM catheter use assess anorectal pressure sit position ( produce Given Imaging , Yoqeam , Israel ) . This simple device stabilizes catheter position patient USP commode allow investigator withdraw behind curtain examination cubicle .</detailed_description>
