	<brief_summary>Complex oro-facial pain poorly diagnose poorly treat cause significant suffering disability . This study explore ability fMRI identify patient complex oro-facial pain respond transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy . Specific Aims : 1 . To establish baseline pattern MRI patient chronic oro-facial pain without definitive etiologic diagnosis . 2 . To estimate rate treatment success transcranial stimulation primary motor cortex ( M1 ) patient . 3 . To identify post-treatment MRI pattern associate treatment success .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : Patients diagnose complex oral facial pain UMPhysicians Complex Facial Pain Clinic meet inclusion exclusion criterion offer participation study . They undergo baseline evaluation depression HAM-D MADRAS scale quality life WHOQOL-BREF scale . Pain assess use 10 point visual analogue scale . Resting pcasl MRI do within 24 hour first treatment . Treatment consist five daily session motor cortex stimulation contralateral pain . Visual analogue pain score obtain treatment . Rating scale , rest pcasl MRI repeat within 24 hour 2 week last treatment . Analysis : FMRI activation pattern examine investigator correlate treatment outcome goal identify fMRI characteristic select patient suitable study .</detailed_description>
