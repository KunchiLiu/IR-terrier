	<brief_title>EHR-based Decision Support Pediatric Acute Abdominal Pain Emergency Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominal pain one common reason child adolescent seek care emergency department ( ED ) . Computed tomography ( CT ) promote method improve diagnostic accuracy evaluate patient acute abdominal pain . In past 20 year , CT use increase dramatically , especially child receive care general ED setting . Although adult cohort , increase CT use associate decreased rate negative appendectomy , similar improvement health outcome among child acute abdominal pain occur . Negative consequence CT include increased cost substantial exposure ionize radiation . Although appendicitis common surgical emergency child , diagnosis remain challenge thus , emergency department ( ED ) provider increasingly rely compute tomography distinguish appendicitis condition . This project ( ) use electronic health record ( EHR ) technology deliver patient-specific clinical decision support ED provider point care , ( b ) assess impact intervention use diagnostic image clinical outcome , ( c ) assess impact intervention cost care deliver . The propose intervention , refer appy-CDS , specifically design widespread use EDs could reduce reliance advanced diagnostic image pediatric adolescent patient acute abdominal pain maintain improve clinical outcome . This cluster randomize trial build 10 year work derivation validation ED-based clinical decision rule , previous successful outpatient emergency department clinical decision support intervention , complex economic statistical analysis risk assessment ED resource use . In project , investigator aim extend benefit previous effort develop implement interactive , evidence-based clinical decision support tool optimize care child adolescent present general non-pediatric ED acute abdominal pain . The result project extend understand maximize clinical return massive public private sector investment make sophisticated EHR system . If successful , flexible decision support tool could adapt implement broadly range acute care setting standardize personalize care deliver pediatric patient .</detailed_description>
