	<detailed_description>The role induce phase 3 contraction control hunger food intake 1 . Background In meal motor activity upper gastrointestinal tract characterize cyclical pattern contraction consist 3 phase : maximal contractile activity originate stomach migrate small intestine ( phase 3 ) , follow phase motor quiescence ( phase 1 ) phase progressively increase motor activity ( phase 2 ) . In 1975 Itoh et . al . link phase 3 contraction migrate motor complex ( MMC ) hunger sensation , increase hunger sensation exogenously administer motilin . The investigator previously demonstrate phase 3 associate 'hunger pang ' . The trigger phase 3 initiation unclear , gut hormone ghrelin motilin presume play role . If either substance administer intravenously , induce premature phase 3 human . In previous study , 'hunger pang ' could objectively detect peak subjective hunger rating visual analog scale ( VAS ) use custom make algorithm . A close association phase 3 contraction gastric origin hunger peak observe spontaneous food intake also find associate hunger peak . By induce phase 3 contraction administration IV erythromycin , time food intake could manipulate . In new study investigator evaluate food intake associate infusion erythromycin cause phase 3 contraction another yet unknown effect erythromycin . To obtain investigator use atropine , muscarinic receptor antagonist , inhibit formation contraction induce low dose erythromycin . Since food intake long pure physiological act still hunger sensation , obtain social emotional status modern time palatable food abundant , relationship subject towards food use multiple questionnaire also evaluate . 2 . Aim To investigate whether contraction antrum necessary induce food intake erythromycin erythromycin secondary effect stimulate food intake . 3 . Methodology 3.1 . Subject selection Healthy volunteer recruit . See eligibility criterion detail 3.2 . Questionnaires Dutch eat behaviour questionnaire ( DEBQ ) : The DEBQ administer measure dietary restraint disinhibition . The DEBQ investigate three field behavioral eating : restrain eating , emotional eating external eating . Council nutrition appetite questionnaire ( CNAQ ) : This questionnaire appetite-monitoring instrument develop Council Nutritional Strategies Long-Term Care . Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale ( HAD ) : This questionnaire use exclude subject mood &amp; anxiety disorder . Power food scale ( PFS ) : The PFS evaluate psychological impact live environment palatable food abundant . 3.3 . Protocol Study design Gastric motility register 7h overnight fast ( see ) . During period volunteer allow ingest standardized liquid meal twice time point choice . The volunteer expose liquid meal start experiment palatability meal score ; do standardized way ( cup , temperature , duration , smell taste ) . The liquid meal low-caloric soup similar composition one use Hjelland et . al . The volunteer aware investigator want study association gastric motility , hunger food intake ; receive information investigator want examine effect fast motility stomach hunger . During experiment watch standardize movie neutral emotional content standardize time point . They rate hunger every 5 minute offer opportunity drink meal time point choice . At start experiment two intravenous catheter place separate arm subject . During entire study saline administer intravenously low rate blind subject towards time drug administration . The infusion bag position behind curtain , way time drug administration blind subject . The administration drug , 40 mg motilin receptor agonist erythromycin lactobionate ( Erythrocine ; Abbott , Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve , Belgium ) , give randomized fashion time point 90 , 180 , 270 360 min start study . An infusion macrolide antibiotic give two time point , one erythromycin infusion precede 15 µg/kg IV bolus atropine ( Stellatropine ; Pharmacobel , Brussels , Belgium ) plus 30 min infusion 15 µg/kg/hr atropine . The administration atropine give 10 minute infusion erythromycin opposite arm erythromycin infusion . The arterial pulse frequency monitor continuously administration atropine . If start point infusion coincide spontaneous phase 3 , infusion postpone 15 min phase 3 pass . Manometry Recording antroduodenal intraluminal pressure perform use Manoscan® high resolution manometry catheter ( out diameter 4.2 mm , 36 channel space 1 cm apart ) . The catheter introduce via nose position catheter , see figure 1 , briefly check fluoroscopy ( typically 5 second , never 25 second ) . This part comply relevant guideline radioprotection participant protect leaden shield cover low abdomen , Personnel carry leaden jacket , expose primary beam wear dosimeter time . The catheter place way , measure point antrum distal pylorus accurately record migrate motor complex . The output manometry channel record monitored on-line via ManoScan 360™ ( Sierra Scientific Instruments , Los Angeles , CA ) . After overnight fast , manometry assembly introduce describe secured subject 's nose adhesive tape . The subject position comfortable sit position knee bent ( 80° ) trunk upright specifically design bed . Behavioural rating At 5-minute interval , volunteer indicate score hunger expect amount eat 10cm VAS . Emotions score 15-minute interval electronic grid mood scale .</detailed_description>
