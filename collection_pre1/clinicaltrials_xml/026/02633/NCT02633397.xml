	<detailed_description>The study consist screen epoch , 12 week double blind treatment epoch , follow-up epoch 30 day post treatment . Following completion screen baseline assessment , patient meet inclusion none exclusion criterion randomize 1:1 basis receive either placebo riociguat start dose 1.0 mg TID ( three time day ) 12 week . The dose titrate every 2 week base patient 's monitoring systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) well-being assessed visit . Safety monitor include physical examination , hemodynamics , vital sign , clinical laboratory assessment conduct 2 week interval double blind study treatment . Safety tolerability , especially pain , assess use several specific patient report outcome instrument . Functional outcomes measure change six minute walk distance Borg Dyspnea Scores assess baseline Week 12 .</detailed_description>
