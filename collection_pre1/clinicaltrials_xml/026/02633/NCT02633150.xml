	<brief_summary>Obesity , chronic disease , real public health problem high prevalence also high risk complication , include insulin resistance ( IR ) type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . The mechanism involve development IR well know . Oxidative stress inflammation induce food overload could initiators IR mechanism skeletal muscle , responsible use nearly 80 % glucose response insulin therefore play major role regulation glucose metabolism . Thus , increase ROS ( Reactive Oxygen Species ) , marker oxidative stress chronic low-grade inflammation demonstrate subject obesity , latter decrease weight loss . Therapeutically , loose weight still difficult day , complexity chronic disease . Thus , well establish restrictive diet expose weight rebound , dramatic medically human term patient . Support physical activity also difficult reduced mobility patient , refer lack motivation among . Finally , investigator treatment `` against-obesity '' demonstrate benefit / risk enough use routinely . It therefore essential seek mean struggle IR , see help weight loss . In parallel , well establish consumption certain antioxidant , include polyphenols ( PP ) grape extract whole food , modulate favorably several pathway responsible development IR cell model animal . The result antioxidant supplementation human controversial . However , supplementation study human use PP , Resveratrol supra nutritional dos ( ie compatible balance diet fruit vegetable ) . In previous study , investigator test interest supplementation red grape PP nutritional dos healthy subject metabolic risk ( overweight subject relate first degree T2DM patient ) IR hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp measure . During study , PP prevent central mechanism muscle IR oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction induce load fructose . For project , investigator propose test effect red grape PP supplementation nutritional dose 8 week IR weight loss 30 obese insulin resistant . This double-blind randomized placebo-controlled . This supplementation associate standard support obesity perform routinely Nutrition Diabetes unit . Specific inclusion criterion : Female male nondiabetic 50-65 year , BMI &gt; 30 kg / m2 HOMA &gt; 3 . The main objective test whether supplementation PP improve systemic insulin sensitivity ( GIR : rate glucose infusion ) measure hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp ( gold standard measure insulin sensitivity ) insulin-resistant obese subject . Secondary objective : - Test whether supplementation PP improve insulin sensitivity tissue ( fat muscle ) compare response supplementation two tissue . - Determining cellular molecular mechanism involve improve IR : regulation inflammation , oxidative stress . - Determine whether supplementation PP optimize weight reduction compare standard single support . NSN : The number subject require evaluate previous work ( 2013 Hokayem et al . ) Whose main objective ass impact PD versus placebo first degree relative patient diabetes type 2 . Under bilateral alternative hypothesis nonparametric test ( Mann-Whitney ) , 1 : 1 ratio , power 80 % alpha risk 0.05 , number subject estimate 15 per group . Methodology : Anthropometric measurement , assessment body composition ( DEXA ) system application characterization ( metabolism , inflammation , oxidative stress , adipokines insulin sensitivity : clamp hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic , lipopolysaccharides : LPS ) / tissue characterization ( biopsy skeletal muscle tissue adipose ) : insulin sensitivity , inflammation , oxidative stress , gene regulation ( sirt1 ) , mitochondrial activity / cell characterization ( adipocyte precursor muscle ) insulin sensitivity , inflammation , oxidative stress , sirt1 . Investigators hope demonstrate non-pharmacological treatment base nutritional dos PP supplementation improve insulin sensitivity insulin-resistant obese patient , refer optimize weight loss compare standardized management obesity determine mechanism involve .</brief_summary>
