	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effective safe clinical dose new gadolinium-based contrast agent ( GBCA ) P03277 injection Central Nervous System ( CNS ) lesion detection visualization conventional steady-state CNS imaging . Therefore , Contrast Noise Ratio ( CNR ) , well-known quantitative parameter directly relate contrast medium/GBCA efficacy , choose primary endpoint order precise determination P03277 clinical dose . This multi-center , international , prospective , double-blind , randomize , control , parallel dose group , cross-over comparator study male female subject present either know highly suspected focal area disruption Blood Brain Barrier ( BBB ) ( e.g . primary secondary tumor , focal inflammatory demyelination disorder ) , schedule undergo routine contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) CNS . This study conduct approximately 40 center worldwide . Two subset subject include study : - The first subset include first subject study center . Subjects administer 0.05 0.1 mmol/kg body weight ( BW ) P03277 MultiHance® , 0.1 mmol/kg BW . - The second subset comprise subject select site . Subjects administer 0.025 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 mmol/kg BW P03277 0.1 mmol/kg BW MultiHance® . During course study , two MRIs obtain subject : one unenhanced P03277-enhanced MRI ; one unenhanced MultiHance®-enhanced MRI . MRI evaluation perform on-site investigator three independent off-site blinded reader .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject presenting , time inclusion , know highly suspected focal area disrupt BBB ( e.g. , primary secondary tumor , focal inflammatory demyelinate disorder ) include least one expect enhance lesion minimum 5 mm ( long axis ) . This lesion must detect previous image procedure ( computerized Tomography ( CT ) MRI ) . Subject present acute chronic Grade III ( least ) renal insufficiency , define estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m² base two eGFR assessment , one within 7 day first study MRI day MRI ( eGFR result &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m² , subject eligible ) .</criteria>
