	<brief_title>Multicenter Study Evaluate Efficacy Treat Extend Regimen Aflibercept ( EYLEA ) Second Line Treatment Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , multicenter , single arm study . The study group compose type 1 2 diabetes mellitus patient centre involve DME . Patients partial incomplete response first-line treatment least 4 monthly intravitreal injection longer 12 month treatment . Patients get treatment study eye ( fellow eye receive standat care treatment ) / The study eye receive intravitreal injection aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml enrolment ( day 0 ) . The next follow visit 4 week later . At visit , sub- intra-retinal ( ) fluid present patient receive intravitreal injection aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml treatment interval remain 4 week . In case resolution improvement ( define decrease central macular sub-field thickness 10 % previous visit gain one ETDRS line ) , intravitreal injection aflibercept discontinue 6 monthly injection patient follow every 4 week . If worsen 10 % macular thickness and/or loss one EDTRS line acuity follow treatment discontinuation injection resume . In case sub- intra-retinal fluid OCT , treat extend regimen ( TER ) apply . Patients receive injection aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml , follow interval extend by2 week . Maximal treatment interval 4 month . At point sub- intra-retinal ( ) fluid appear TER regimen initiate , interval visit treatment reduce back previous interval obtain fluid free macula.The follow period 52 week .</detailed_description>
