	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose idasanutlin ixazomib citrate give together dexamethasone treat patient multiple myeloma return period improvement . Drugs use chemotherapy , idasanutlin dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Ixazomib citrate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving idasanutlin , ixazomib citrate , dexamethasone together may work well treat patient multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Idasanutlin , Ixazomib Citrate , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerated dos ( MTD ) idasanutlin ixazomib ( ixazomib citrate ) use combination dexamethasone patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma TP53 ( 17p ) deletion . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate confirm response rate ixazomib idasanutlin use combination dexamethasone patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma TP53 ( 17p ) deletion . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe toxicity confirm response rate associate combination idasanutlin , ixazomib dexamethasone . ( Phase I ) II . To describe toxicity associate combination idasanutlin , ixazomib dexamethasone . ( Phase II ) III . To describe complete response ( CR ) good partial response ( VGPR ) rate . ( Phase II ) IV . To assess progression-free overall survival . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess murine double minute 2 ( MDM2 ) inhibition bone marrow plasma cell . II . Identify potential biomarkers associate response . III . To explore pharmacodynamic effect idasanutlin . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study idasanutlin ixazomib citrate follow phase II study . Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 idasanutlin PO daily ( QD ) day 1-5 every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 every 28 day 12 course discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month , every 6 month .</detailed_description>
