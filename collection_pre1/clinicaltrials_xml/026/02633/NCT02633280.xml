	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) heterogeneous respiratory disorder affect 200 million patient worldwide . It characterize enhanced chronic airway lung inflammatory responses noxious agent ( e.g . smoke , pollutant ) progressive airflow limitation . Both , prevalence incidence disease continuously increase , thus investigator predict 2020 third important cause death world . Several immune system cell ( e.g . macrophage , eosinophil ) biochemical mediator ( e.g . tumor necrosis factor-alpha , transform growth factor beta , Interleukins metalloproteases ) involve development symptom severity . It suggest COPD patient spillover peripheral lung inflammation systemic circulation result increase level various inflammatory marker : IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-α . Those biomolecules responsible various complication associate COPD cardiovascular disease , hypertension skeletal muscle weakness name . It worth note increase systemic inflammatory marker also responsible diabetes , obesity metabolic syndrome development COPD patient . Diagnosis , , base clinical evaluation spirometry test COPD treatment include use LABA , LAMA corticosteroid . Therefore , early diagnosis order ass specific treatment mandatory . Sarioglu et al. , report systemic inflammatory marker level ( plasma ) TNFα , IL-6 C-reactive protein , persist stable period 110 COPD patient C-reactive protein level correlate COPD Assessment Test . However , C-reactive protein specific marker , date appropriate marker ( ) could represent microRNA ( miR ) key class gene expression regulator , emerge crucial player various biological process cellular proliferation differentiation , development apoptosis . In concern , Stolzenburg et al. , document , experimental model COPD , miR-1343 reduces expression isoform TGF-b receptor 1 2 , directly target 3 ' UTRs mRNA region , suggest role improvement lung fibrosis . To date , data perform yet topic . In present project investigator would like screen nCounter GX Human Inflammation Kit comprehensive number 249 human gene know differentially express inflammation . The gene list represent broad range inflammation-related pathway . In parallel miRs screening perform ( 800 single reaction tube ) use NanoString Technology Platform . This technology robust sensitive today use validation New Generation Sequence ( NGS ) data . Our aim evaluate COPD patient role miRs predictive biomarker , disease order signature miRs typically COPD . The signature could use monitoring therapeutic application drug use COPD well asses Prediction COPD Diagnostic test . The absence plasmatic marker able identify stage disease response treatment lead COPD exacerbation progression , represent , real life , common problem COPD treatment also related increase sanitary health cost . Last year , European health bill COPD treatment increase USD 10 million market think increase USD 37.7 million 2030 .</detailed_description>
