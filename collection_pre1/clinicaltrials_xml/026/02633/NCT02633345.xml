	<detailed_description>Background : The human saliva offer easy accessible non-invasive opportunity study bacterial interaction well biomarkers health disease . The Human Microbiome Project provide insight biofilms inside outside body co-evolved mankind play important role health . This also true oral cavity microbiota play passive role actively contribute maintenance oral health . However , certain ecological shift microbiome allow pathogen manifest cause oral disease . According ecological plaque hypothesis , caries periodontitis result environmentally induce overgrowth aciduric proteolytic specie , respectively . Bacteriotherapy term use harmless effector strain implant host 's microflora maintain restore natural microbiome interference and/or inhibition microorganism , especially pathogens . This might open alternative way fight infectious disease less harmful side effect may also help treatment disorder seem nothing bacteria , asthma , obesity diabetes . Probiotic bacteria , define `` Live microorganism , administer adequate amount , confer health benefit host '' ( WHO ) , commonly suggest candidate bacteriotherapy . The potential mechanism action still fully understood seem clear local ( direct ) well systemic ( indirect ) effect . According Reid potential avenue : ) co-aggregation pathogen growth inhibition , ii ) bacteriocin hydrogen peroxide production , iii ) competitive exclusion antagonistic activity adhesion sit nutrition , iv ) systemic immunomodulation . In vitro study show effect co-aggregation growth inhibition clinical study show effect clinical parameter gingival inflammation still little known immunomodulatory effect host-microbe interaction . Periodontal disease among widespread infectious disease man lead tooth loss . If leave untreated gingivitis lead periodontitis . The different surface oral cavity continuously bath saliva several pathogenic specie saliva associate periodontal disease . Studies microbial effect probiotic bacteria oral health far base conventional cultivation method focus one strain . The new high-throughput technique provide possibility comprehensive precise picture bacterial profile , date study use sequence determine bacterial composition saliva intake probiotic bacteria . Most analyze composition short term intake probiotic bacteria . Hence , one study analyze composition long intervention period correlate clinical outcome . Aim : The aim study investigate effect tablet contain probiotic candidate strain , gingival inflammation level select pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) . A secondary aim describe effect tablet salivary microbiome . The null hypothesis clinical measurement , level cytokines microbial composition saliva differ baseline study control group . Study design : The study plan double-blind ; placebo control randomize trial two parallel arm . The intervention period plan 4 week . The study plan submit ethical approval . Material : The participant recruit among patient clinic School Dentistry www.forsogsperson.dk . 80 participant plan enrol informed consent randomly allocate either probiotic group placebo group . Sample size determine power analysis ( α= 0.05 β=0.2 ) base value BOP obtain previously . Seventy-four participant need 80 enrolled order compensate expect drop-outs . Recruitment : If participant read notice study express interest study invite information appointment assistant professor dentist Mette Kirstine Keller . Prior appointment , participant inform right bring companion information meeting . They also receive write information study . The appointment take place meeting room without people present investigator , participant possibly companion . The oral information base write information give plain language without value-laden term . The investigator responsible ensure participant understood give information project begin . All comment participant take relevant consideration information interview study . At time participant withdraw project . The informed consent participation trial give basis oral write information , consent may give least 24 hour reflection time . The project include subject , physical mental handicap , give informed consent . Methods : Intervention : After informed consent , baseline examination sampling , participant randomly assign one study group give supply either probiotic tablet placebo tablet . The probiotic tablet contain Lactobacillus rhamnosus PB01 Lactobacillus curvatus P2-2 dose 1 * 109 CFU/tablet . The strain choose base vitro assay investigate growth inhibition pathogens immunomodulation . The placebo tablets identical size composition without addition probiotic strain . Both tablet provide Bifodan A/S . The participant instruct take one tablet morning one evening thirty minute tooth brushing . The tablet pack identical pot color coding . The code keep investigator analysis finish . The participant take two tablet day four week . Follow registration conduct two week , four week six week . Clinical procedure : At visit , saliva GCF ( Gingival Crevicular Fluid ) collect plaque index ( PI ) ) bleed probe ( BOP ) register . For collection GCF , two contralateral buccal site upper incisor , canine premolar select participant . Visual supragingival plaque select teeth remove site dry cotton pellet . GCF collect use periopaper strip ( ProFlow , Amityville , NY , USA ) gently insert gingival sulcus 20 s. The position strip mark chart secure identical sample site follow ups . In case blood contamination , strip discharge sample repeat 5 min . The volume GCF record use Peritron 8000 ( Proflow ) express μL . One strip hold approximately 0.1-0.4 μL GCF . The strip transfer plastic tube store -80ºC analysis . For saliva sample , paraffin-stimulated whole saliva collect 3-minute period least two hour food intake . The approximate amount saliva normal rate 3-6 ml 3 minute . The collected saliva immediately frozen 1.5 ml aliquot store -80ºC analysis . The remainder sample destroy completion study . Laboratory procedure : Analysis cytokine GCF : The absorbed GCF eluated 120 μL PBS ( phosphate buffer saline ) contain 0.05 % Tween 20 . The level INFγ , TNF-α , IL-8 , IL-10 IL-12 determine use luminex multiplex immunoassay panel ( LINCOplex , LINCO Research , Inc , USA ) accordance manufacturer 's manual . The concentration cytokine express pg/ml . Analysis salivary microbiome : Total bacterial DNA extract 2 ml thaw saliva sample identification comparison composition stability total microbial community two trial group amplicon sequence phylogenetic marker gene 16S rRNA . The hypervariable region V3-V4 bacterial archaeal 16S rRNA gene PCR amplify use specific primer 341F 806R analyze establish high-throughput sequence pipeline develop University Copenhagen Microbiology partner base state-of-the-art sequencing technology ( Illumina Mi-Seq ) custom make bioinformatic tool specifically design analysis large microbiome datasets . Statistical method : All data process SPSS software ( v 22.0 ; Chicago , Ill , USA ) . The follow-up value compare baseline within group Wilcoxon pair two-sided test difference group analyze Wilcoxon unpaired test . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistical significant . Data management : All collect data treat compliance Act Processing Personal Data `` The Health Law '' . At inclusion participant assign unique number separate protocol without personal identification number . Scientific importance : The study may provide evidence probiotic tablet influence clinical marker gingival inflammation and/or pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine , lead new strategy manage gingivitis maintain oral health . The use probiotic bacteria treatment dental disease could one option use antibiotic . Furthermore provide new insight effect introduce new strain salivary microbiome suppose significant event bacteriotherapy . Risks Adverse Effects : The participant fully cover patient insurance The School Dentistry cover damage trial participant study .There expect side effect treatment probiotic . Probiotics generally consider safe ( GRAS : Generally Recognized As Safe ) The European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) . The participant ask report unexpected adverse effect . Ethical consideration : The participant benefit directly treatment , knowledge gain study might contribute prevention microbial derive illness mouth , e.g . caries periodontitis , future . The sample collection cause discomfort participant tablet know side effect . Therefore , personal benefit participant correspond minimal risk discomfort participant . The participant complete trial compensate gift voucher 500 DKK Magasin . It emphasize positive , negative inconclusive result publish . Time Schedule : Preparation study carry winter 2014/2015 . After ethical approval , patient recruit study winter/spring 2015 .</detailed_description>
