	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness pre-operative artesunate give orally day 14 day prior surgery patient Stage II/III colorectal cancer . Artesunate establish antimalarial drug excellent safety profile , well tolerate affordable . A number laboratory study one small pilot clinical study patient colorectal cancer show artesunate reduce activity cancer cell . Two hundred patient diagnose operable colorectal cancer randomly allocate receive oral artesunate 200mg daily match placebo 14 day prior surgery . Patients follow closely 5 year see give artesunate preoperatively reduce risk cancer return treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Effectiveness Study Pre-operative Artesunate Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artemisinins family sesquiterpene trioxane anti-malarial agent derive Sweet Wormwood ( Artemisia annua L ) , plant use traditional Chinese medicine century . Artesunate derivative artemisinin convert active metabolite dihydroartemisinin ( DHA ) . Artesunate widely use antimalarial good safety profile oral route administration . Artemisinins demonstrate broad anti-cancer effect include pro-apoptotic , anti-proliferative , anti-angiogenesis anti-metastatic effect . Despite multi-modality treatment approach colorectal cancer , 5 year overall survival currently exceed 60 % . Neoadjuvant pre-operative therapy may effective eradicate micrometastases compare adjuvant therapy deliver following delay immunological stress surgery . However current neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen often associate significant side effect may result delay surgery whilst patient recover . A well tolerate , affordable , novel anticancer agent could give patient whilst wait surgery , without cause surgical delay due treatment related toxicity , would significant clinical impact patient care . In NeoART trial , 200 patient Stage II/III colorectal cancer plan curative surgery , randomly allocate receive either pre-operative oral artesunate 200mg daily match placebo two week prior surgery . Patients follow closely 5 year follow treatment see artesunate associate improved recurrence free survival . The safety tolerability neoadjuvant artesunate colorectal cancer also assess .</detailed_description>
