	<detailed_description>This study Clinical Trial . The methodology compare incidence fall two group . The intervention group attend three session workshop , learn recognize risk factor fall , encourage adopt healthy diet ( vitamin D consumption ) , modify home hazard , increase physical activity ( strength balance program home group walk route ) . After monthly telephone follow-up invited attend recall session , realize change strength balance test result . The control group attend single workshop session summarize major point prevention fall ( risk factor fall , healthy diet vitamin D consumption , home hazard , physical activity ) . After monthly telephone follow-up invite attend three session workshop prevention . GOALS GENERAL Evaluate effectiveness intervention program form health education workshop reduce incidence fall independent population age 65 old living community . SPECIFIC : 1 . Estimate compare effectiveness intervention program workshop health education simple intervention respect : • Final result : Principal : number percentage fall regular physical exercise 150 minute week aerobic exercise two time week strength training . Improvement body mass index . Contribution supplement vitamin D. Improved test score Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB test Guralnik ) • Intermediate outcome : Reduction number risk identify home . assistance physical exercise group . Maintenance support group physical exercise . Reduction fear fall ( Fall Efficacy Scale abbreviate ) Improved quality life ( EuroQol 5 ) attendee know get fall . 2 . Select volunteer audience wish train develop new edition workshop teacher , reach Community dimension primary prevention , supervision research group . 3 . Other : - Knowledge : Identify general risk factor fall . Identify personal risk factor fall . Identify drug associate increase risk fall . - Attitudes : Guide avoid risk factor circumstantial household fall . Recognize lifestyle favor fall . Reinforce practice daily physical activity . Encourage change towards balance diet . Reviewing reason fear fall . Support creation self-help group encourage physical exercise daily . - Skills : Apply advice receive housing clothing . Demonstrate know develop balance healthy menu daily . Demonstrate know ground fall . METHODOLOGY Experimental study type randomize clinical trial , control , parallel simultaneous monitor group . The scope study community , social network belong major center Community Madrid Random assignment senior center intervention group intervention control perform . Masking participant receive intervention do , mask analysis statistical data ignore group belong result . The selection criterion subject wide allow extrapolation result , increase external validity study . The intervention three-session workshop explore detection correction risk factor fall , change work habit relate fall apply intervention show effective literature . Working knowledge , attitude skill . It follow period one year follow monthly phone call know existence falls period session assess memory change . The intervention compare group counsel report risk factor associate fall necessary intervention habit associate . Working knowledge without delve change attitude . Follow frequency call perform intervention publicize existence group fall period . In term population , selection make accord criterion inclusion exclusion , recruitment voluntary type . The workshop promote community level senior center select site locate workshop point interested person . The inclusion period cover two week prior date set workshop day include . demographic ( age , sex , cultural socioeconomic status ) , data relate fall ( fall previously , current treatment vitamin D , concomitant disease , associate , toxic drug ) , accessibility data collect ( residence next workshop venue , existence stairs home , time availability attend session , physical limitation attend regardless ) . Person 65 year old , habitual residence ( nine month per year ) coverage area senior center participant , independent ambulation field without help another person , able attend : inclusion criterion define session , acceptance telephone follow-up , commitment attend final session , give informed consent participate trial . Institutionalized person , moderate severe cognitive impairment etiology , blindness , total deafness , trouble reading , absolute contraindication exercise surgery previous 6 month : exclusion criterion define . The study variable follow , addition previously refer demographic , related fall Accessibility : Previous fall yes / , Alcohol yes / , grams alcohol / week Group neuroleptic drug , benzodiazepine , . Number drug . Number barrier identify checklist . Corrected number barrier . Reduce alcohol consumption , perform homework , complete daily finding , conduct prior workshop activity ( type activity , minute , time week ) , nutritional Journal : point . Weight , height , BMI , waist circumference . Fall Efficacy Scale abbreviate - point , apply advice receive three session ( Diet- yes / , Exercising-yes / risk Home Improvement yes / ) , group form go three week workshop . Make exercise properly ground yes / , number attempt . Vit D treatment prior . Previous physical activity . Stairs home . Technical assistance walk . Limitations physical activity . Active disease . 5D EuroQol quality life : point . Health today point . Existence hazard home zone . The assignment participant control group intervention group may random type intervention propose , senior center randomize receive workshop sequence intervention monitoring sequence . It make , outside professional research team , random sample list 32 Centres Elderly Community Madrid . As intervention meet priori criterion benefit primary prevention , control group receive three intervention session workshop end follow-up period 12 month . The participant ignore existence two kind workshop , mask achieve , however , possible sign inform consent prior allocation intervention another . As researcher teach workshop impossible masking since give workshop sequence another . It make double-blind follow-up period perform telephone survey group researcher educational workshop . Statistical analysis evaluation responses statistical development outside study conduct , reach triple blind . As follow-up period , know primary prevention evaluate time long . We establish period one year follow-up minimum refer literature detect impact reduce fall intervention regard physical activity intake vitamin D. However aim researcher extend monitor phone second phase complete second year . Protocol ensure pattern telephone call data collect identical group , score reason stop monitoring whenever possible . The strategy data analysis take account exclusion participant ( physical limitation ) cause abandonment follow-up workshop . An analysis do intention treat participant maintain data group assign regardless end workshop . The calculated sample size 316 participant , 158 participant arm . Comparison two proportion , unilateral test ( intervention superior standard treatment ) , 95 % confidence level , 80 % statistical power , P1 ( ratio - . Incidence fall gr control usual care ) 25 % , P2 ( expect incidence fall intervention group ) 12 % ( 13 % reduction ) . Sample size ( n ) = 109 , expect loss ratio 20 % . Design effect ( 30 subject per center . ICC 0.05 ) . Design effect = 1+ ( 30.01 ) * 0.05 = 1.15 . Design effect 109 * 1.15 = 126 . Adding 20 % loss = 158 participant per arm . This study design pragmatic trial , evaluate effectiveness workshop primary prevention fall , broad selection criterion heterogeneous population , reality apply , favor generalization result . As limitation provide study , one participation healthy individual , prevention field require great number participant , long follow-up possible high rate default . Furthermore risk specific bias participation . You may select people come senior center premise cartel expose invitation , priori great asset willing activity social relationship . It plan around limitation later edition workshop , offer sensitize social partner issue expands . Another limitation supply vitamin D , proven effective present high deficit vitamin . However since external study health system available prior analytical determination , may decide supplement 600 800 unit day opt increase level contribution diet . However , letter family physician Participant expect percentage participant evaluate vitamin deficiency receive supplement vitamin D. These data record take account analysis phase .</detailed_description>
