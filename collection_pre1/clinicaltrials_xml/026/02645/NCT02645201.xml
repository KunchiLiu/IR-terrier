	<detailed_description>This 10 week , randomize , double blind , placebo control , multicenter study evaluate efficacy GASTRUS® frequency adverse event eradication rate H. pylorus infection child . Subjects : Children age 5 ( &gt; 15 kg ) -18 year , diagnose H. pylori infection upper endoscopy least two validated test , meet inclusion exclusion criterion list . Subjects RUT ( Rapid Urease Test ) positive day endoscopy offer participate study , include 3 visit . They give information study 1-week diary fill visit 1 . The properly fill diary consider screen tool include patient study also consider part study . At visit 1 write informed consent must obtain caregiver also participants 10 year age . At visit , physical examination perform well symptom assessment diary evaluation . Only patient positive culture H. pylori antibiotic susceptibility test double resistance , fill diary enrol . Patients receive prescription triple therapy : omeprazole , amoxicillin metronidazole / clarithromycin 14 day depend antibiotic susceptibility . The dose regimen determine accord weight child . The child randomize receive chewable tablet contain 4x108 CFU GASTRUS® placebo similar appearance taste . Active placebo tablet supply . Subjects take 1 tablet twice day 21 day . Diary 2 - dispense ( instruction ) fill 21 day visit 2 . Visit 2 take place 21+/- 3 day visit 1 . At visit physical exam perform diary 2 collect . Diary 3 remind fill one week visit 3 plan 8 week visit 2 +/- 5 day . At visit 3 , diary 3 collect . 13C-urea breath test monoclonal stool antigen test perform assess H. pylorus status eradication treatment . In order ensure child fill diary , parent phone one week visit 2 3 . Our study population child Europe Israel diagnose H. pylori infection least two recommend diagnostic method . The investigator complete document consider enrolment . The sample size calculate assume adverse effect develop 30 % treated child , aim detect difference 20 % base 0.80 power detect statistically significant difference ; therefore recruitment continue 118 subject randomize 2 group ( test placebo ) least 59 child .
