	<detailed_description>Previous study show feasibility detect mutation status circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient . However , clinical standard method establish , previous study lack prospective clinical data aim advanced NSCLC . We plan perform prospective study include consecutive case NSCLC patient underwent surgical treatment . Primary tumor plasma sample collect patient gene mutation analysis perform immediately surgery . We utilize target DNA sequence next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) platform detect driver somatic mutation match tumor DNA ( tDNA ) plasma ctDNA sample match white blood cell ( WBC ) DNA control . A panel gene identify .</detailed_description>
