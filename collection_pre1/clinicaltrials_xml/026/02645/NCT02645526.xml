	<brief_title>Is Woolen Cap Effective Maintaining Normothermia Preterm Infants During Kangaroo Mother Care ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Neonatal hypothermia important challenge associate morbidity mortality . Preventing neonatal hypothermia important high resource country , fundamental importance low resource setting supportive care limit . Kangaroo mother care ( KMC ) low-cost intervention , whenever possible , strongly recommended temperature maintenance . During KMC , World Health Organization ( WHO ) guideline recommend use cap/hat , effect temperature control KMC remain establish . In hospital participate project non-governmental organization CUAMM , KMC represent standard care , head baby often remain uncovered due local habit unavailability cap . Objective : The aim present study ass effectiveness safety woolen cap maintain normothermia low birth weight infant ( LBWI ) KMC . Methods : This multicenter ( three hospital ) , multi country ( three country ) , prospective , unblinded , randomized clinical trial KMC treatment without woolen cap LBWI . After obtain parental consent , infant birth weight &lt; 2500 g candidate KMC assign KMC woolen cap KMC without cap group 1:1 ratio accord computer-generated randomized sequence . The primary outcome measure temperature normal range ( 36.5-37.5Â°C ) course KMC first week life . In participant , axillary temperature measure digital thermometer 4 time per day . In addition , maternal room temperature record . Secondary outcome measure : episode apnea ; sepsis ; mortality hospital discharge ; in-hospital growth ; age discharge .</detailed_description>
