	<brief_title>Pre-hospital Administration Tranexamic Acid Moderate Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) remain significant public health concern poor outcome one unmet need medical care . Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) show reduce blood loss elective surgery improve outcome traumatic injury due bleed without obvious adverse event . In CRASH-2 Intracranial Bleeding Study , nest randomized trial design , study show treatment TXA within 8 hour injury associate reduction haemorrhage growth [ adjust difference , -3.8 ml , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , -11.5 ml 3.9 ml ] , few focal ischaemic lesion [ adjust odds ratio ( OR ) 0.54 , 95 % CI 0.20 1.46 ] few death ( adjust OR 0.49 , 95 % CI 0.22 1.06 ) patient TBI ( Glasgow coma score â‰¤ 14 ) . The study also provide direction future research TXA TBI , especially patient moderate severe TBI intracranial intracranial bleed ( define presence parenchymal , subdural epidural haemorrhage ) common . Furtherly , result CRASH-2 trial stress importance early adminstration TXA trauma patient , evidence show treatment TXA within 1 hour post injury could significantly reduce risk death , benefit exist TXA administer 3 hour injury . If use TXA could incorporate pre-hospital management TBI , outcome traumatically injured patient would improve early stage . Thus , study set employ randomize controlled study design , sample 400 patient , evaluate efficacy safety early use TXA pre-hospital management moderate severe TBI .</detailed_description>
