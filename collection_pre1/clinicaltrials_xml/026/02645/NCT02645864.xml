	<brief_summary>Esophageal cancer one common malignant tumor . The annual incidence esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 260,000 mortality 210,000 China . Different western country , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) still dominant pathological type China account 95 % case clinic . The prognosis ESCC poor . About 50 % patient advanced disease diagnosis 5-year survival rate 5-7 % . Though esophagectomy standard treatment , disease relapse many patient . For patient unresectable recurrent disease , chemotherapy important treatment alone radiotherapy . Taxane , platinum , fluoropyrimidine report effective ESCC popularly use first-line treatment ESCC . However , still standard 2nd-line treatment patient fail first-line treatment . Both irinotecan taxane study 2nd-line treatment esophageal cancer patient . But ESCC patient involved study . Except chemotherapy , target treatment another promising treatment esophageal cancer . In recent year , antiangiogenic treatment prove effective tolerable many cancer lung , colorectal , gastric cancer . Apatinib also know YN968D1 , orally antiangiogenic agent . Preclinical clinical data show effective treatment variety solid tumor include esophageal cancer . And approve launch China 2014 3rd-line treatment patient advance gastric cancer . Therefore , investigator initialize dose escalation phase I study explore safety irinotecan apatinib combination treatment ESCC patient relapse disease esophagectomy failure 1st-line chemotherapy . Investigators analyze maximum tolerate dose ( MDT ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) study .</brief_summary>
