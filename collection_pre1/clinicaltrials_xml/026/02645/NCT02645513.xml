	<brief_title>Text Message Reminders Health Workers Malaria , Pneumonia , Diarrhea Case Management Malawi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Mobile health , m-health include use portable device , mobile phone , patient monitoring device , personal digital assistant , wireless device support medical public health practice . Mobile phone widespread Asia Africa , dissemination health-related message via mobile phone inexpensive way reach geographically dispersed recipient . Evidence develop country , scarce , particularly improve health service delivery . Only one rigorously design study , randomize control trial Kenya , assess use mobile phone text message improve health worker case management practice , show send daily text message reminder health worker six month lead 24-percentage-point improvement correct management uncomplicated malaria . Malaria endemic throughout Malawi pose significant burden health system . Malawi change malaria case management guideline 2011 require diagnostic confirmation microscopy malaria rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) prior treatment . A health facility survey 2011 prior rollout RDTs find 67 % patient malaria correctly treat , primarily due miss diagnosis malaria . Although recent assessment lack , likely Malawi face similar problem document sub-Saharan African country : non-systematic diagnostic test febrile patient malaria , poor adherence negative test result , failure administer first dose antimalarial therapy consultation , gap patient counseling . Furthermore , additional assessment point deficiency quality care common illnesses Malawi , pneumonia diarrhea , similar widespread quality problem find develop country . Study design objectives This study trial text message reminder health worker Malawi improve case management malaria common illness . The study employ cluster-randomized , controlled trial design pre- post-intervention measure , health facility cluster unit randomization . In several district Malawi , health facility randomize one three arm : 1 . Text message health facility-based health worker correct management malaria ( patient age ) 2 . Text message health facility-based health worker correct management malaria ( patient age ) common illness , per Integrated Management Childhood Illness guideline ( patient &lt; 5 year ) 3 . Control health facility health worker receive study intervention ( routine supervision support supervisor district health management team , occur text message arm well ) Justification This study add small grow body literature potential cell phone text message improve malaria case management different setting . In addition provide evidence rigorously design study effectiveness text message reminder health worker improve malaria case management , propose study expand promising initial evidence base follow way : - Assesses effectiveness text message reminder set malaria diagnostic test - Expands intervention include patient age , child &lt; 5 year - Includes message common non-malarial illness , include pneumonia diarrhea Methodology All health worker provide clinical care work pharmacy dispense drug facility randomize arm 1 2 receive text message . Before intervention , data collection via cross-sectional health facility survey occur three study arm include patient exit interview focus history , physical examination , blood smear ; health worker interview ; brief facility assessment . Results survey used measure baseline level case-management quality malaria disease pinpoint performance deficiency target text message intervention . Once preliminary baseline result available , workshop hold key stakeholder , include National Malaria Control Programme staff , researcher , technology specialist , health education specialist , health worker , discuss result design appropriate intervention strategy , include message content timing . Text message reminder case management malaria ( arm 1 ) malaria common illness ( arm 2 ) send health worker twice day intervention group six month . At end six-month text message intervention , approximately one year baseline survey , follow-up data collect another cross-sectional health facility survey . At time , in-depth interview also conduct select health worker intervention facility well understand reaction text message help determine mechanisms action text message reminder . A second follow-up health facility survey conduct six month end intervention ass extent change performance maintain time . Cost data intervention also collect cost-effectiveness analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>( Health worker receive text message reminder . These health worker ( others work sample outpatient department ) eligible interview day team 's visit . In addition , patient visit study health facility eligible exit interview , primary way outcome assess . ) For health worker receive text message : Providing outpatient care dispense drug health facility randomize one two intervention arm . For health worker interview baseline , endline , followup survey : work outpatient department sample team visit . For patient interviewed baseline , endline , followup survey : visiting facility see clinician first time current illness</criteria>
