	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn safety effectiveness use AmnioFix® ( dehydrate human amnion/chorion membrane , also call dHACM ) help improve return erectile function bladder control patient robotic assist laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RARP ) . dHACM section tissue make part placenta donate mother C-section . It look like small piece tissue paper wrap around nerve bundle surgical area . The tissue may help body 's normal healing process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized AmnioFix Study During Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant eligible agrees take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . Participant equal chance either group . This do one know one study group well , , bad group : - If participant Group 1 , RARP dHACM . - If participant Group 2 , RARP alone . Participant tell group assign reach end study . Participant sign separate consent form surgery explain risk . During Surgery : If participant Group 1 , dHACM wrap around nerve bundle end surgery . For group , surgery , participant 's surgeon may decide RARP possible . In case , participant take study dHACM use . Information also collect participant 's surgery , detail surgery , hospital stay , side effect may . Study Visits : Participant visit study doctor standard follow-up visit surgery 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month . At visit , participant complete questionnaire complete screening . At 24 month , participant 's medical chart review call phone learn disease come back . If participant call , call last 5-10 minute . Length Study Participation : Patient 's participation study 24-month medical chart review call . This investigational study . The dHACM commercially available use various type surgery . Its use prostate surgery help improve return erectile function bladder control patient RARP investigational . Up 100 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
