	<brief_summary>This study prospective multicenter randomize control trial Asian country compare effect safety right median nerve stimulation versus traditional treatment comatose patient early stage follow traumatic brain injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asia Coma Electrical Stimulation ( ACES Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause mortality morbidity one great unmet need public health . The severe injury lead poor outcome prolong coma victim . It estimate ten fifteen percent severe TBI patient discharge prolonged coma vegetative state . However , treatment measure data proven robustly alter pace recovery improve neurological outcome comatose patient follow TBI . Although right median nerve electrical stimulation ( RMNS ) use clinically two decade , strong evidence efficacy generate limitation past trial include small sample size inappropriate study design . In present study , multicenter research network inclusion neurotrauma center China , India , Nepal Kazakhstan establish aim validate efficacy safety promise intervention strategy traumatic coma early stage . Since RMNS simple , inexpensive , noninvasive technique good safety profile , study probably add evidence treatment traumatic coma Asian country .</detailed_description>
