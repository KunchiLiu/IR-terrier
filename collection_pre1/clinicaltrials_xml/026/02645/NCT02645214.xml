	<brief_title>Antiseptic Scrub Contamination Transmission Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator perform 3-arm prospective , blind , randomize , control trial cross-over design determine HCP wear antiseptic-impregnated clothing ( i.e. , surgical scrub ) acquire transmit few pathogen HCP wear standard clothing . A total 40 intensive care unit ( ICU ) nurse ( Medical Surgical ICUs Duke Medical Pavilion ) enrol sign consent form participate study . Their main task wear control ( non- antiseptic ) scrub ( Arm 1 ) two different type antiseptic-impregnated scrub ( Arms 2 3 ) . Subjects randomized one 6 strategy . Each nurse typically care two patient day enrol three consecutive day ( shift , work 3 day row ) . Once nurse consent participate project , study coordinator provide 3 set scrubs label number , thus blind nurse scrubs wear day . The nurse wear scrub 3 pre-arranged shift . Data summarize use standard statistical method . The investigator utilize linear mixed model compare relative difference amount contamination arm end shift adjust crossover study design . Mixed effect logistic regression model use compare proportion . All calculation adjust amount environmental contamination observe shift contamination HCP clothing begin shift . Statistical significance two primary comparison ( antiseptic scrub versus control ) correct multiple comparison . This minimal risk study investigator safety concern patient nurse relate obtain swabs room culture , wear scrub culture . Data store encrypted Duke Medicine server ( participant log &amp; study IDs ) and/or REDCap database ( data collect study ) .</detailed_description>
