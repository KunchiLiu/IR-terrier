	<brief_summary>This patient orient translational research project aim improve clinical outcome patient BRAF NRAS wild-type unresectable Stage III Stage IV metastatic melanoma progress , unable receive standard therapy ( general , immunotherapy ) . Consecutive patient see three major clinic fit broad eligibility criterion invite participate . The approach design test impact different target drug different mutation single type cancer . In project , patient tumour tissue genetically profile determine mutation ( ) present , assign receive match drug expect target mutation ( ) tumour . Where multiple target identify one patient , multiple potential therapy would appropriate single tumour mutation , treat clinician may determine appropriate therapeutic approach consultation study team , use late version library match therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current standard care test cover mutation BRAF NRAS gene . The comprehensive gene test platform use project design interrogate entire coding sequence 315 cancer-related gene plus intron 28 gene often rearrange altered cancer . These gene know somatically alter solid cancer base recent scientific clinical literature . The test panel use melanoma tissue patient pre-screened BRAF NRAS wild-type melanoma . The extent test update reflect new discovery melanoma tumourigenesis availability new therapy project proceeds . Testing perform formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sample metastatic tissue . Archival tissue primary regional recurrent melanoma may consider recent sample available possible . All new patient unresectable Stage III IV melanoma see participate site invited participate . Following write consent , patient undergo standard test BRAF NRAS mutation . Patients find mutation either gene receive standard treatment dabrafenib / trametinib molecular testing . Patients wild type version BRAF NRAS gene tumour tissue send extend gene test platform . These patient first receive standard care therapy wild type BRAF / NRAS melanoma , possible . Once standard therapy exhaust ( disease progression intolerable adverse event ) , patient receive target therapy match genetic result , applicable . The selection target therapy base clinical evidence activity solid tumour harbour similar mutation / least Phase I test melanoma . The table match therapy modify extend new finding clinical research become available . Patients may include specific clinical trial target therapy available , e.g . MEK inhibitor combine MDM2 inhibitor ( AMG232 ) BRAF TP53 wild-type melanoma MEK inhibitor combine CDK4/6 inhibitor BRAF wild-type melanoma . The extensive molecular profile platform fully validate conducted external provider accredit authority responsibility award Laboratory Accreditation private public facility .</detailed_description>
