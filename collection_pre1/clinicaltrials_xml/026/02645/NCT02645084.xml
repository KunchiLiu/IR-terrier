	<brief_summary>In trial investigator evaluate effectiveness implementation digital familial risk questionnaire detection CRC patient hereditary familial CRC . This do use stepped wedge design 5 participating hospital duration 1.5 year . A comparison make intervention phase ( offer online risk assessment questionnaire ) control phase ( hospital-based standard practice detection CRC patient hereditary familial CRC , inform referral criterion use intervention group ) . All patient diagnosis CRC first appointment CRC outpatient clinic include . The primary outcome percentage include patient receive recommendation regular surveillance colonoscopy himself/herself and/or relative , provide clinical geneticist . Data clinical geneticist use answer question .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : This multicenter prospective comparative cohort study , use stepped-wedge design . All cluster ( hospital ) start control strategy switch , one one , intervention strategy . Every 9 week hospital start implement questionnaire short training period 1 week . As referral clinical geneticist take several month , allow least 6 month collection result genetic test . Control strategy : Each hospital start control strategy . Just start study , hospital send list clinical genetics referral criterion use study . Each hospital decide use criterion . Intervention strategy : Before start study , hospital inform use online questionnaire implement . They also receive manual use online CRF questionnaire . The online CRF use send invitation questionnaire , report baseline characteristic ( age , sex , nationality , educational level , native language ) , reason non-participation , number change need make verify complete questionnaire calculate referral advice . In train week , researcher AMC present study involve person facilitate implementation online CRF questionnaire . All nurse doctor participate study provide login code online CRF . Patients include train week include analysis . All consecutive patient CRC first appointment outpatient clinic invite complete online questionnaire receive record number . In case patient decline complete questionnaire , report nurse gastroenterologist online CRF . If patient consent , email send patient link questionnaire question complete next visit outpatient clinic . The online CRF automatically result check indication referral clinical geneticist . The nurse gastroenterologist report advice patient file decide refer patient . Checking referral clinical geneticist : Every two month , patient include study track search report clinical genetics consultation medical file check local genetic center do . Statistical analysis primary outcome measure : The difference control group intervention group proportion patient receive surveillance advice clinical geneticist calculate . A nonlinear mixed model use test hypothesis difference . We model probability receive surveillance advice linear function , logit transformation , explanatory variable hospital , time interval , questionnaire effect : Logit ( pijk ) =μ+αi+βj+Χijθ , Where Logit ( pijk ) natural logarithm odds referral clinical geneticist individual ( k ) cluster time j. μ overall mean , αi random effect hospital , βj fix effect corresponding time interval j , Χij indicator variable implementation questionnaire hospital time j θ questionnaire effect . Time effect analyze discrete way ( season , month ) case primary effect find . If time effect present , time function exclude model . For primary outcome measure , use intention-to-treat principle , include eligible patient analysis . Statistical analysis secondary outcome measure : secondary outcome measure , difference control intervention group calculate use relative risk correspond 95 % confidence interval . Secondary outcome measure calculate intervention group , report use descriptive statistic . Sample size calculation : For sample size calculation , two-group chi-squared test equal proportion use start point compare proportion referral control group versus intervention group . Significance level set 5 % ( two side ) power 80 % . Of CRC case , approximately 20 % related familial hereditary factor . In literature report proportion CRC patient increase familial risk CRC appropriately refer clinical geneticist range 8 % 67 % , study report proportion 10 % 30 % . We estimate 20 % patient risk refer , result referral rate 4 % CRC patient . We anticipate implementation questionnaire increase proportion 15 % .To detect difference would need sample size 111 patient per treatment group . For stepped wedge design total sample size ( 111x2 ) need multiply design effect , calculate use follow formula , k number step , b number baseline measurement , n number patient per cluster , number measurement step ρ intracluster correlation ( ICC ) , compare within-group variance between-group variance : DEsw= ( ( 1+ρ ( ktn+bn-1 ) ) / ( 1+ρ ( 0.5ktn+bn-1 ) ) ) . ( ( 3 ( 1-ρ ) ) / ( 2t ( k-1/k ) ) ) The ICC estimate 0.10 previously report ICC topic available . As five participate hospital , total number five step ( k ) possible . As study duration one year , step take 2 month . After randomization , hospital start train period one week add two month . We expect two eight eligible patient per week per hospital , result 16 64 patient per hospital per step . With information , DEsw calculate . Assuming 16 patient per step , DEsw 0.45 . Assuming 64 patient per step , DEsw 0.47 . This correspond required total sample size 100 104 patient , respectively . When divided total number patient per cluster , 6.2 1.6 cluster need minimum maximum number include patient respectively . We therefore believe number five cluster would sufficient . Institutional review board : This study approve institutional review board ( IRB ) Academic Medical Center ( AMC ) Amsterdam , Netherlands . This IRB decide study meet requirement Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act ( WMO ) . All local ethic committee confirm local practicability study . Consent : According requirement AMC Research Code , digital approval ask patient make use personal data study intervention group . This mean questionnaires start question willingness participate study . They answer question indicate 'yes ' 'no ' . If 'no ' answer , result remove database . Use digital questionnaire consider safe answer collect anonymously could link patient secure key document . This study carry accordance Helsinki Declaration . No approval data use ask patient control group , would increase awareness would therefore bias result . Moreover , data patient collect anonymously . Monitoring quality assurance : The AMC researcher monitor center every month . Each site randomize visited training week .</detailed_description>
