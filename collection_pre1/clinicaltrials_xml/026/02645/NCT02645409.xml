	<detailed_description>Administration study drug , OTL38 , begin prior skin incision preoperative area safety monitoring occur . The tumor resection occur approximately 2 hour bring back operating room wait time infusion take back operating room . Intraoperative fluorescent image utilized parallel standard operate procedure capture image surgery . Images also take excised specimen back table . The excised specimen send pathology department fluorescent image immunohistochemistry FR . Subjects 2-5 day hospital stay ( normal nephrectomy recovery period ) safety measurement take . Final safety measurement take 10-day 1-month follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
