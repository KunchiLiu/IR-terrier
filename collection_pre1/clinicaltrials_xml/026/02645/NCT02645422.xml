	<brief_summary>The aim present study identify new obesity-related genetic defect determine association clinical manifestation family childhood-onset severe obesity . The investigator hypothesize explore child severe early-onset obesity find new obesity-related genetic defect explore obesity-associated clinical manifestation investigator elucidate outcome severe childhood obesity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Determinants Clinical Consequences Early-onset Severe Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity complex disorder many contribute genetic environmental factor . The genetic cause mechanism severe childhood obesity still incompletely understood . It acknowledge obesity individual could consequence rare genetic variant strong effect - rare variant might population specific . The aim study determine - inheritance pattern early-onset obesity - new obesity-related genetic variant disease-causing gene mutation - association obesity-related genetic defect clinical manifestation - association obesity-related genetic defect psychiatric symptom patient early-onset obesity first-degree relative Significant advancement genetic methodology provide new tool explore genetic defect underlie obesity . Family-based approach provide several advantage compare cohort study investigate genetic determinant complex diseases.The unique genetic composition Finnish population enable identification novel genetic entity . Discovery genetic defect associate severe childhood-onset obesity increase investigator understanding pathogenesis obesity allow early detection , genetic testing , increase risk optimal target preventive measure .</detailed_description>
