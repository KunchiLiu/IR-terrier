	<brief_title>PASCAL Laser Platform Produces Less Pain Responses Compared To Conventional Laser System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) severe complication diabetes mellitus characterize new vessel formation retina optic disc . Tight glycemic control laser treatment early phase disease may slow progression PDR . Panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) laser-based treatment modality destroy out retina layer thereby improve oxygen supply inner retina . During follow year , sequential improvement take place , include introduction yellow , green , diode laser various advantage wavelength . In 2006 , novel semi-automatic multi-shot photocoagulator call PASCAL ( Pattern scan laser , Opti-Medica Corp. , Santa Clara , California , USA ) introduce reduction pulse duration laser spot typical 100 ms 10-30 millisecond . Compared conventional laser , short pulse show significantly reduce risk damage adjacent retinal tissue . Almost patient experience pain PRP . While patient may tolerate pain , majority . One study report 64.1 % patient complete treatment due pain therefore increase risk vision loss . To improve patient compliance , several anesthetic analgesic technique peribulbar anesthesia , oral anesthesia topical eye drop use . The patient comfort , thus compliance , may improve use short exposure burn , avoid red infrared wavelength deeper penetration , decrease overall treatment time . The aim current study compare severity express pain score patient PDR underwent either PASCAL conventional laser . As method study , eye treat within session one eye treat PASCAL laser , treat conventional laser ( ELLEX Integre , Adailade , Australia ) 30 minute rest interval . To avoid bias orientation become accustom laser procedure , PASCAL laser perform first eye half patient ( 14 patient ) conventional laser perform first eye half patient randomly . While spot size use obtain white-grayish spot retina 200-400 Âµm PASCAL conventional laser , pulse duration 100 ms conventional laser 30ms PASCAL laser . In order accurately reliable compare grade pain procedure , retinal area total number spot standardize . Similar number laser spot create two laser system retinal quadrant eye . Ten minute procedure end severity pain assess use verbal rating scale visual analog scale ( VAS ) . In verbal scale patient rate pain Likert scale verbally , e.g . `` none '' , `` mild pain '' , `` moderate pain '' , `` severe pain '' `` severe pain '' five grade system ( 0-4 ) VAS specify severity pain indicate position along continuous line 0 10 . Using score , relationship severity pain patient characteristic include history prior PRP treatment ( experience ) , gender duration diabetes mellitus assess . Patients assign either experienced non-experienced group depend history prior PRP .</detailed_description>
