	<brief_summary>Two regional anesthesia technique already use common clinical practice -paravertebral block pectoral nerve block ( PECS block ) compare randomize , double-blind , multicenter , control , non-inferiority trial , order compare success rate patient udergoing breast surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is PECS Block Equivalent Paravertebral Block Preventing Postoperative Pain After Breast Surgery ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim study compare paravertebral block PECS block success rate patient undergo elective breast surgery ( mastectomy quadrantectomy ) combine anesthesia technique . Primary outcome block success rate define VAS score 30 less PACU 6 , 12 24 hour surgery . Secondary outcome : rescue opioids requirement ; incidence procedure related complication ; incidence postoperative side-effects ; patient ' quality life level first 24 postoperative hour ; patient ' satisfaction . A prospective , randomize , control , double-blinded , non-inferiority trial design order compare paravertebral block PECS block regard block success first 24 hour postoperatively patient undergo mastectomy quadrantectomy procedure combine anesthesia technique . Inclusion criterion : adult patient , ASA class 1 3 , schedule elective mastectomy quadrantectomy . Exclusion criterion : patient refusal , contraindication regional anaesthesia ( coagulopathies , concurrent anticoagulant therapy , allergy local anaesthetic , infection puncture site ) . After write informed consent , patient randomize two cohort , first treated paravertebral block , second PECS block . Both procedure standardize regard injection technique , local anaesthetic drug volume perform ultrasound real-time guidance . Both group undergo regional anesthesia technique induction general anaesthesia blind regard type block . This standardized well , accord center current clinical practice . Postoperative pain measure validated visual analogue scale ( VAS 0-100 ) recovery room periodically discharge ward 24 hour postoperatively . Rescue opioids requirement record . Eventual procedural complication occur record well postoperative side effect . A questionnaire patient ' satisfaction quality life first 24 postoperative hour fill every patient . Data collect initially insert form subsequently collect , pool anonymously register electronic data base . A sample size calculation preliminary perform regard primary outcome . A 20 % difference block success rate ( define postoperative pain VAS scale 30 less ) consider clinically significant . In practice , paravertebral block current gold standard associate average 50 % mean value VAS scale first 48 postoperative hour . PECS block thus compare standard care . A total 39 patient per arm require ( 95 % confidence interval ) . Accounting 10 % drop-out rate , include 43 patient per arm . Pain level measure median interquartile range . Statistical analysis perform use Student t-test normally distributed variable Mann-Whitney test apply non-normally distributed variable . This study conduct compliance protocol , current version Declaration Helsinki , ICH-GCP ISO EN 14155 ( far applicable ) well national legal regulatory requirement .</detailed_description>
