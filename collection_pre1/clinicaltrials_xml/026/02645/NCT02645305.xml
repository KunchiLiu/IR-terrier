	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) name collection lung diseases include chronic bronchitis , emphysema chronic obstructive airway disease . People COPD difficulty breathe , primarily due narrow airway , call airflow obstruction . Some preclinical evaluation show COPD closely related chronic inflammation ; therefore , study aim use adipose-derived stem cell ( ADSCs ) form non-expanded culture - usually name stromal vascular fraction ( SVF ) combination activate platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) treat disease . Both SVF PRP autologous source obtain adipose tissue peripheral blood , respectively . This mixture intravenously transfuse patient .</brief_summary>
