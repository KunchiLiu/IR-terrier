	<detailed_description>Implementing evidence-based computerized decision support system link electronic health record improve care cancer patient . Short Title/Acronym ONCO-CODES Protocol Code IRST100.23 Rationale : Computerized decision support system ( CDSSs ) computer program provide clinician , staff , patient , individual person-specific , actionable recommendation management option intelligently filter present appropriate time enhance health health care . CDSSs might integrate patient electronic health record ( EHRs ) evidence-based knowledge . The Investigators design pragmatic randomized control trial evaluate effectiveness patient-specific , point-of-care reminder generate Medilogy Decision Support System ( MediDSS ) clinical practice quality care Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori ( IRST ) IRCCS . The Investigators hypothesize MediDSS reminder increase clinician adherence guideline , eventually , improve quality care offer hospitalized patient . The adoption CDSSs likely increase across healthcare system due grow concern quality medical care discrepancy real ideal practice , continuous call meaningful use health information technology , increase use familiarity advance technology among new generation physician . Study Design : The ONCO-CODES ( Computerized DEcision Support ONCOlogy ) trial pragmatic , parallel group , randomize control study 1:1 allocation ratio Study Duration 12 month Study Center ( ) Single-center Objectives : The primary outcome trial process outcome . i.e . rate issue report reminder resolve ( resolution rate ) . Number Subjects : The investigator calculate sample size basis primary outcome . A sample 1,704 reminder necessary detect difference two group ( power = 0.90 ; Î± =0.05 , two-sided ; 1:1 allocation ) . Since estimate intracluster correlation available , Implementing evidence-based computerized decision support system link electronic health record improve care cancer patient . Diagnosis Main Inclusion Criteria : The investigator include patient admitted facility IRST IRCCS . There exclusion criterion Statistical Methodology : All analysis follow intention-to-treat principle : patient analyze group randomize . Descriptive statistic present . All statistical test two-sided . The investigator use Stata software perform statistical analysis ( Stata Corp. , College Station , TX , USA ) .The investigator increase required sample size ( 20 % ) 2,046 reminder account cluster patient .</detailed_description>
