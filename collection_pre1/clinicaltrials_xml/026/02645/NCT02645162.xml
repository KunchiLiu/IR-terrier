The primary outcome child 's school readiness , index early academic social emotional competency assess follow 6-9 month intervention exposure . The compliance , fidelity quality implementation process also assess order understand feature moderate outcome whether community-engagement strategy facilitate demand-side action scale-up . The expected outcome trial include model quality preprimary education address current supply-side gap , facilitate learn demand-side action support scale-up across broad range early childhood intervention .</brief_summary>

Effect integrate responsive stimulation nutrition intervention Lady Health Worker programme Pakistan child development , growth , health outcome : cluster-randomised factorial effectiveness trial . The Lancet , 384 ( 9950 ) , 1282-1293 . 2014 ) use A-cluster software . Strata rural/peri-urban . The inclusion criterion include cluster randomization : functioning LHW function primary school village . Five cluster assign intervention control arm via simple randomization . Sample Size The sample size estimate 30 child per cluster total 300 child , adequate take account estimate 10 % attrition rate . Subject Enrolment Control Arm : Children age define inclusion criterion identify list register child Lady Health Worker ( near record possible ) . The sample stratify age group describe intervention group . Experimental Arm : A list child meet inclusion criterion available LHW . Any additional child verify respective LHW prior enrolment . Enrolment child experimental group define child register attend least 3 day preschool week 1 . Data Collection Instruments All instrument develop English first instance translate Sindhi ( back translation ) pilot prior use study . A systematic adaptation protocol follow . Quality Assurance The following strategy use - A 10 % sample assessment observe field supervisor score simultaneously inter-rater agreement . This shall follow feedback session assessor . - Daily debrief meeting hold challenge solution discuss also use opportunity learn . - A 10 % sample classroom observation video record coding expert . - Anthropometry equipment calibrate daily . Data Management Forms check prior entry . The data entry software include check minimize error . Data entry do data entry office locate field office . All form data enter . A weekly report status data entry share data entry office . Data Analysis Plan : An intention treat model .</detailed_description>
