	<brief_title>Registry Exploring Clinical Epidemiological Characteristics Interstitial Lung Diseases - EXCITING</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) heterogeneous group 200 entity idiopathic result disease and/or treatment . All form ILD consider seldom seldom ( so-called `` orphan '' disease ) , entirety seem represent epidemiological burden , underestimated , e.g . `` normal '' symptom elderly . The knowledge epidemiology ILDs limit , general Germany particular . For Germany current , valid comprehensive population-based data ILDs exist appropriate ILD classification available long time . The epidemiological data , collect introduction current classification ILD accord ATS/ERS consensus HRCT consider diagnostic gold standard , reliable . Furthermore systemic investigation relate development ILD risk group , patient undergo radio- chemotherapy patient connective tissue disease , restrict . Thus , little known cost associate ILDs . Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) , one disease entity , show associated high healthcare utilization cost England USA , many case lung transplantation therapeutic option also new pharmaceutical treatment costly . But lack data healthcare utilization financial consequence ILD IPF Germany . Therefore , registry provide important database health economics health service research question . Against background , multi-centre , non interventional prospective observational disease outcome registry ILD aim collect valid data form health care incidence , prevalence , regional distribution , characteristic , management outcomes different ILDs clinical practice condition . In detail , demographic data gender , age , country birth , place residence ; disease relate data subtype ILD , treatment center , diagnostic procedure ( e.g . HRCT , lung biopsy , pulmonary function test ) ; risk factor ( e.g . smoking status , profession , familial ILD ) ; co-morbidities ; ILD management analyse kind frequency pharmacological non-pharmacological therapy ; outcome ; consumption resource record . Therefore , registry allow obtain comprehensive current epidemiologic report ILDs Germany particularly helpful uncover correlation risk exposure disease development . This study , 100 site , initially focus federal state Baden-Wuerttemberg Hesse , plan minimum 5 year 600 patient enrolled part study screening/baseline visit , Informed Consent Form sign , every 6 month regularly updates/phone contact perform . Following quality procedure applicable registry : - Quality assurance plan address data validation registry procedure , include plan site monitoring audit . - Data check compare data enter registry predefined rule range consistency data field registry . - Source data verification ass accuracy , completeness , representativeness registry data compare data external data source ( e.g. , medical record , paper electronic case report form , interactive voice response system ) . - Standard Operating Procedures address registry operation analysis activity , patient recruitment , data collection , data management , data analysis , report adverse event , change management . - Sample size assessment specify number participant participant year necessary demonstrate effect . - Plan miss data address situation variable report miss , unavailable , `` non-reported , '' uninterpretable , consider miss data inconsistency out-of-range result - Statistical analysis plan describe analytical principle statistical technique employ order address primary secondary objective , specify study protocol plan .</detailed_description>
