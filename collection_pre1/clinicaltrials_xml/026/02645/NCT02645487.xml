	<brief_summary>SRS dose escalation brain metastasis radiation-naïve patient establish true tolerable dos , may exceed current standard dos . This may lead improvement local control , patient survival , and/or quality-of life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery ( SRS ) Brain Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , several large randomize study show patient limited brain metastasis , whole brain radiation safely defer treat SRS close surveillance . In light , patient treat SRS alone without WBRT . However , SRS dose set Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 90-05 continue apply patient without previous cranial irradiation . The potential insufficiency current SRS dose long-term tumor control press concern . The advance chemotherapy lead improvement overall survival many patient metastatic cancer , include malignancy often associate brain metastasis , lung ( 40-50 % ) breast ( 15 % ) . As patient survive long , patient may develop brain metastasis current dose SRS may adequate control brain metastasis duration survival . In fact , evidence control rate decline time SRS , 3 year , local control rate may 60 % . In case brain metastasis relatively radio-resistant melanoma , report 12-months local control rate SRS range 52 % 75 % . More potent SRS dos could lead improved long-term control brain metastasis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Biopsyproven nonhematopoietic malignancy , except small cell lung cancer , germ cell cancer , unknown primary tumor . Radiographic evidence MRI brain metastasis . ( If patient unable tolerate contrast , MRI without contrast acceptable ) All brain metastasis must outside brain stem ( midbrain , pons medulla ) . Patient must 10 less brain metastasis . The maximum diameter lesion must less 4.0 cm . Previous treatment surgery , radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy target agent allow provide : Systemic therapy administer &gt; 7 day SRS Radiation brain . Surgery brain &gt; 7 day prior SRS remain least one additional brain metastasis target SRS Age ≥ 18 year . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Score 2 well . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration protocol therapy . A female childbearing potential woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . Patients chemotherapy , immunotherapy target therapy within 7 day prior anticipated SRS treatment date planning systemic therapy within 7 day follow protocol treatment . Patients craniotomy surgery brain within 7 day date SRS . Patients leptomeningeal metastasis . Patients contraindication MRI implant metal device foreign body severe claustrophobia . Patients life expectancy &lt; 3 month . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness , include limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia . Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients must pregnant time SRS treatment .</criteria>
