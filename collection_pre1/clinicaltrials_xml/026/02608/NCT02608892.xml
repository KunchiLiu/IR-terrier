Objectives : To conduct pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) inform aspects full-scale trial parent-targeted BSweet2Babies knowledge action ( KTA ) intervention . The objective full scale trial evaluate effectiveness BSweet2Babies video show parent newborn prior newborn screening , subsequent use effective pain reduction strategy newborn screen blood test . Study design method : This study pilot 2-armed RCT enroll 100 parent mother baby unit The Ottawa Hospital . Following consent , research assistant randomize parent one two group : intervention group ( view BSweet2Babies video prior baby 's newborn screening blood test ) control group ( intervention ) . Parents group complete brief baseline survey establish previous knowledge use pain management strategy . Participants intervention group subsequently view 5 minute BSweet2Babies video . Lastly , participant intervention group ask complete second online survey view video . To evaluate use BF , SSC sucrose newborn screening , study research assistant collect data baby 's electronic medical record . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome use BF , SSC sucrose newborn screening measure use data electronic medical record . The secondary outcome : ) feasibility recruit parent show video prior infant ' newborn screening ; ii ) effectiveness ( i.e . video influence intent use/advocate one strategy ) ; iii acceptability ( i.e . would recommend video parent suggest improvement video ) . The secondary outcome measure online survey .</detailed_description>
