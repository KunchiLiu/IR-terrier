	<brief_summary>Seaweeds natural source nutrient , dependent variety , rich dietary fibre , protein , essential vitamin mineral . However resource highly underexploited . Countries Japan , China , North South Korea large consumer edible seaweed exposure Western country much low mainly industrially extract seaweed derivative , common additive many food healthcare product . Seaweeds associate number human gut promote health benefit decrease faecal transit time gastrointestinal tract thus prevent constipation result reduce exposure harmful substance ( decrease colon cancer risk ) . These health benefit attribute seaweed high dietary fibre content . Interestingly , food healthcare industry already utilize seaweed-extracted fibre manufacturing process thus steer way forward towards development novel functional food product . These seaweed-extracted fibre high molecular weight polysaccharide know hydrocolloid non-digestible human , hence classify dietary fibre . Traditionally , seaweed derive polysaccharide ( hydrocolloid ) use provide thicken gel functionality food stuff industrial application however emerge evidence show lower molecular weight polysaccharide oligosaccharides derived hydrocolloid also act source soluble fibre may prebiotic activity . Recent development Japan Korea lead commercial availability product contain low molecular weight seaweed derive fibre . There also evidence beneficial effect seaweed derive fibre key health area cardiovascular health , cancer , diabetes obesity . However , relatively little known chemical , physio-chemical fermentation characteristic seaweed fibre human gut . Some hydrocolloid , notably guar gum ( plant source ) , also employ health promote property area glucose tolerance cholesterol lowering . However use hydrocolloid functional food ingredient health benefit consumer rather limit focused us product diabetic . It particularly area gut health small medium-sized enterprise ( SMEs ) involve hydrocolloid production processing , enter functional food ingredient market use innovative processing technology . The total dietary fibre content seaweed high 75 % total dry weight high proportion soluble . The fibre component essentially comprise structural polysaccharide i.e . alginate fucoidan brown seaweed , carrageenan , agar porphyran red seaweed ulvan green seaweed . As fibre primarily soluble , form viscous gel pass gastrointestinal tract . Some fibre ferment low intestine general , soluble insoluble seaweed fibre tend pass gut without digest . In natural form part seaweed plant , fibre typically high molecular weight pass gut rapidly gut microflora utilize great extent . There therefore necessity develop low molecular weight form soluble add high concentration food product without affect sensory property product . The overall aim project realize opportunity produce low molecular weight polysaccharide ( LMWP ) alginate- agar-bearing seaweed application food &amp; health . The two effective agar alginate LMWPs , identify vitro study , select assessment prebiotic activity feed trial human volunteer ( Ulster University ) part European Union ( EU ) study . The end point assessed stimulation beneficial bacteria ( bifidogenic effect ) , increase short chain fatty acid production , beneficial effect stool formation , improvement gut barrier function . Additionally , benefit LMWPs towards blood glucose level ( short term acute ) assess .</brief_summary>
