	<brief_title>Single Versus Multiple Fractionated SSRS Spinal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although conventionally fractionate radiation therapy utilized decade , rate complete pain relief local control complex tumor sub-optimal . The management patient spine metastasis undergone great deal change past 5 year . Improvements neuroimaging , computer-assisted treatment planning , radiation therapy technique lead development extracranial radiosurgery . SSRS rapidly adopt clinic preliminary application SSRS appear promise . However , role SSRS remain infancy lack high-quality evidence treatment schedule lack solid understanding adverse event . The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 0631 phase 2/3 study initiate determine whether intensive radiation dose deliver image guide 16-Gy dose single fraction SRS could improve pain control quality life compare conventional external-beam radiotherapy patient localized spine metastasis . While group use treatment schedule total dose 27-30 Gy three fraction . Serious adverse event vertebral compression fracture ( VCF ) fairly low-risk adverse event conventional radiotherapy , nevertheless , crude risk estimate VCF spinal stereotactic body radiation therapy relative frequent . Previous report raise caution give dose predictive factor , however ; whether two widely use SSRS schedule ( ie . single fraction versus three fraction ) provide equivalent pain control minimal side effect remain answered . There randomized trial assess SSRS treatment response SSRS induce grade 3 high adverse event two widely adopt scheme . Thus , investigator propose randomize study determine feasibility deliver single 16-Gy SRS dose versus 3 fraction 24-Gy SRS dose try evaluate toxicity profile gain robust data well predictive factor regard risk complication SSRS , include VCF . The investigator incorporate recently develop report reliable Spinal Instability Neoplastic Scoring ( SINS ) system well-designed patient report outcome measure ( PROMs ) protocol predict adverse event quality life participant . The researcher also try investigate possible association potential bone biomarkers risk assessment SSRS-related adverse bone event . Since patient randomize treatment arm , effectiveness SSRS treatment scheme adverse profile investigate properly present study .</detailed_description>
