	<brief_title>A Study Pembrolizumab With Standard Treatment Patients With Recurrent Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open-label , phase II trial evaluate efficacy safety anti-PD-1 antibody MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) combination standard care gemcitabine cisplatin chemotherapy woman recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer ( encompass ovarian , peritoneal fallopian tube cancer ) . Subjects receive 2 cycle gemcitabine cisplatin chemotherapy follow 4 cycle gemcitabine cisplatin combine pembrolizumab 21-day treatment cycle . Subjects continue receive single-agent pembrolizumab every 21 day maintenance therapy 1 year progression subject meet withdrawal criterion . Tumor image CT scan occur baseline every 6 week ( second cycle ) chemotherapy treatment every 9 week thereafter . The primary endpoint efficacy define overall response rate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST v.1.1 ) . Secondary endpoint efficacy include progression free survival 6 12 month , time progression , duration response overall survival . Safety tolerability regimen determine assess frequency intensity adverse event define Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE v.4 ) . Quality life measure use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer quality life questionnaire ( QLQ-C30 ) .</detailed_description>
