	<brief_summary>Purpose : Stroke common cause death disability Canada . Injury right hemisphere brain parietal cortex particular , common result disorder know 'neglect ' 40 % 95 % patient . These patient fail attend respond event occur leave space; disorder devastate patient caregiver patient become dependent assistance activity daily life ( ADLs ) . The project implement two visual work memory ( VWM ) training program explore influence VWM training neglect symptom well activity daily life . Hypothesis : It hypothesise SWM training protocol lead improvement neglect symptom well improvement ADLs . The project develop novel rehabilitation strategy treat neglect syndrome . Evidence research healthy participant employ video game improve cognition along research use work memory training protocol show broad range benefit accrue train untrained task , suggest investigator approach great potential improve core deficit neglect syndrome . Thus , WM train represent promise avenue rehabilitate neglect patient demonstrate core deficit spatial attention VWM highly interrelate function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rehabilitating Unilateral Neglect Using Spatial Working Memory Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To examine relationship activity daily live , attention spatial work memory investigator participant perform range clinical experimental task several session test . Below outline task use ( attached example task ) . 1 . Clinical Tests : Neglect screening : ( ) The Behavioural Inattention Test ( BIT ) include pencil-and-paper computer tablet test line bisection , figure copying cancellation ass neglect . ( b ) The VRLAT sensitive mean detect Neglect . Participants ask navigate virtual reality joystick . They instruct name object present side virtual path avoid collide object along way . The task take approximately 5 minute complete . The Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) : brief screen tool mild cognitive impairment 2 . Spatial Attention Tasks : covert orient visual attention task ( COVAT ) , computer task participant fixate central point detect target present peripheral location . Targets precede peripheral cue attract attention one side . Targets appear cue location ( i.e. , valid trial ) uncued location ( i.e. , invalid trial ) . This task take around 10 minute complete . 3 . Visual Working Memory Task ( VWM ) : One three colour square arrange vertically right space present 500 m computerize task . Following delay probe stimulus ( bold rectangle ) appear . Participants use mouse click colour bar match colour target previously occupy highlighted space . This task take 30 minute complete . 4 . Activities daily living : The Frenchay Activities Index ( FAI ) short stroke specific questionnaire assess functional status . To assess effect work memory train neglect two group neglect participant assign separate training protocol outline . Outcomes measure include test outline VWM task use training . 1 . Passive SWM training : first group participant perform VWM task describe , actively engage specific component task ( i.e. , passively respond stimulus appear screen ) . 2 . Active SWM training : second train group perform task similar popular video game Guitar Hero . A sequence virtual piano key use tablet computer simplify game . Just Guitar Hero , sequence colour target , correspond specific piano key gradually approach target line point participant hit correspond key virtual piano . A VWM component introduce task present participant sequence key touch follow brief delay . The investigator manipulate load change number item give sequence ( e.g. , 1 , 2 , 3 5 ) . After delay participant require repeat sequence present tap key tablet . 3 . Training regimes outcome measure : Two different length train employed groups; 2 4 week , implement subject factor . Participants complete train protocol half hour per day use tablet computer . Outcome measure take 2 week , 4 week , 12 week include BIT , VRLAT COVAT , VWM , FAI . Neglect participant contrast two control group : healthy age-matched control ( recruit WRAP ) group right brain damage ( RBD ) participant without neglect .</detailed_description>
