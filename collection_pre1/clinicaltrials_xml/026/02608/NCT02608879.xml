	<brief_title>Oral Care Protocol Management Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy-Induced Oral Mucositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral mucositis ( OM ) one debilitate adverse effect cancer patient treat chemotherapy radiation ( RT ) . Currently , effective therapy prevention mucositis , several clinical study suggest professional oral care could effectively reduce severity Radiation Therapy chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis . Palliative treatment , rather preventive curative measure , remain standard care . Evidence-based guideline provide consistent recommendation prevention , treatment management oral mucositis . The investigator hypothesize monitor regimen professional oral hygiene prevents harmful ecological shift oral cavity , improve oral health reduce duration severity Oral Mucositis cancer patient , consequently improve overall quality life treatment . Moreover , investigator hypothesize weekly oral hygiene regimen perform oral health professional effective treat prevent mucositis current standard-of-care treatment . The principal investigator project develop novel oral care regimen protocol treatment oral mucositis . The `` Oral Mucosa Deterging Periodontal Debridement '' ( OMDP ) protocol consist regimen frequent professional oral prophylaxis include tooth cleaning , tooth polish flossing , debridement periodontium deterge oral mucosa . This intervention implement prior maintain throughout entire cycle radiation chemoradiation . Co-adjuvant treatment intense fluoride treatment , oral hygiene instruction palliative mouth-rinses also part protocol . The hypothesis repeat professional prophylaxis oral cavity would protect healthy oral tissue infection inflammation often associate severe case mucositis , consequently reduce mucositis incidence duration . Participants study would attend approximately 9 study visit course 16-18 week , depend specific cancer treatment plan . Study participant randomize receive either oral health protocol , receive weekly basis , standard care oral hygiene instruction tooth brushing , preform bi-weekly basis .</detailed_description>
