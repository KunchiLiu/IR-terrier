	<brief_summary>In light central role extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) pancreatic cancer , investigator propose phase I study evaluate ERK inhibitor BVD-523 recommend phase 2 dose combination nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine patient newly diagnose metastatic pancreatic cancer . The primary endpoint maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) RP2D safety . The secondary endpoint include safety , response rate , biochemical response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . The exploratory endpoint include assess impact BVD-523 MEK/ERK pathway major pathway pertain pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
