	<brief_summary>In patient asymptomatic aortic stenosis ( AS ) , prognostic value reduce leave ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction well know . Consequently , class I indication surgery patient LV ejection fraction &lt; 50 % . However , grow evidence suggest subclinical LV dysfunction , particularly longitudinal myocardial dysfunction , may powerful early predictor outcome , even LV ejection still preserve . In asymptomatic AS patient LV ejection fraction &gt; 50 % , reduce LV global longitudinal strain , assess use speckle track image transthoracic echocardiography , may accurate marker identify early subclinical LV dysfunction thus , improve risk stratification , management timing surgery . Several mono-centric observational small study recently report result emphasize role LV global longitudinal strain AS patient . Therefore , meta-analysis may conduct may provide meaningful data . The investigator hypothesize LV global longitudinal strain determinant outcome asymptomatic patient AS preserved LV ejection fraction .</brief_summary>
