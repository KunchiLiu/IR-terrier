	<brief_summary>Approximately 4,000 woman undergo mastectomy breast cancer year UK around 1,500 immediate breast reconstruction . Approximately half lady implant-based breast reconstruction , many `` implant-assisted '' breast reconstruction Acellular Dermal Matrix . Strattice™ Acellular Dermal Matrix ( pig skin product ) make Acelity . It use cover disguise lower part breast implant . Acellular Dermal Matrices widely use last eight year long-term outcome woman form reconstruction lacking . Despite , one commonly offer method breast reconstruction UK ladies diagnosis breast cancer risk-reduction setting . The objective study ass long-term outcome Strattice™-based breast reconstruction multiple Breast Surgery Centres across UK . This case-control study compare woman immediate implant-based breast reconstruction Strattice™ ( case ) without ( control ) . This achieve review analysis retrospective data patient undergone immediate breast reconstruction use implant without Strattice™ follow either diagnosis breast cancer risk-reduction . In addition prospective clinical assessment reconstruction outcome . Outcomes assess include complication , surgical re-interventions aesthetic result . These related co-morbid condition risk factor . Data also collect unplanned intervention associate cost , available .</brief_summary>

Secondary Outcomes To investigate short long-term outcome Strattice™ include : - Quality Life - In-patient treatment cost - Ipsilateral Revision rate - Aesthetic outcome - Breast reconstruction softness ( Tonometry ) - Regional pain - Loco-regional recurrence - Effect radiotherapy - Complications - ( seroma drainage , skin necrosis/ wound breakdown ) Study Design - All patient immediate implant-based breast reconstruction identify prospective database . - Patients invited enter research study post . The invitation letter include : offer take part study , Patient Information Leaflet , Stamped address envelope Accept/Decline outcome form . - If fail respond , patient re-contacted one occasion , manner , approximately two month . - Patients invited attend clinical appointment Breast Surgery Centre reconstruction perform . Here see clinical researcher presence clinic nurse consent participate study . - Patients ask undergo clinical assessment , Tonometry ( measurement breast reconstruction softness ) medical photography . The data obtain anonymised inputted database analysis . - Patients receive postal questionnaire follow clinic visit ask `` Patient Reported Outcomes '' reconstruction . ( This perform clinic visit attempt avoid bias ) . They receive follow-up questionnaire 12 month later . - The medical record patient review assess outcome include complication surgery . - If patient consent prospective part study , retrospective audit note implant loss , revision complication perform - All data collect Case Report Forms .
