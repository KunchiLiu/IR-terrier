	<brief_title>The Safety , Tolerability Efficacy Dronabinol , Treatment Nausea Vomiting Familial Dysautonomia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study ass safety , tolerability efficacy dronabinol treatment nausea patient FD . The pilot trial recruit 25 patient FD complain severe nausea affect quality life . The trial divide two consecutive , independent part . Part 1 , address safety tolerability dronabinol patient FD use open-label dose titration phase follow 4-weeks wash-out period . Part 2 address efficacy dronabinol treatment nausea patient FD use randomize , placebo control , double blind , 12-week cross design . The first specific aim proposal ass safety tolerability dronabinol patient FD . The second specific aim proposal determine whether stimulation endocannabinoid receptor dronabinol improve recurrent nausea patient FD . Secondary aim determine whether stimulation endocannabinoid receptor dronabinol increase weight , decrease anxiety .</detailed_description>
