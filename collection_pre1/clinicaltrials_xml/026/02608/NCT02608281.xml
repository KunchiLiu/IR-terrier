	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES The primary objective clinical study ass value low-dose CEDEM comparison CE-MRI . The diagnostic accuracy breast cancer detection low dose CEDEM evaluate . Investigator plan explore diagnostic quality 4 standard view bilateral dual energy subtract image compare CE-MRI blind reader study . A goal evaluate , whether sensitivity specificity low-dose CEDEM comparable breast MRI . Subjects ask diagnostic workup participate clinical study . Approximately 80 subject schedule diagnostic CE-MRI ( i.e. , base screen mammography classify BI-RADS® 0 , 4 5 ) , eligible participate study undergo follow 4 view bilateral low dose contrast enhance mammography procedure . Radiologically , subject include study population even distribution mass , cluster microcalcifications , architectural distortion give nature breast cancer development . The study population include breast composition . Diagnostic CE-MRI Examination If eligible , subject positive incomplete screen mammogram ( BI-RADS 0 , 4 5 ) undergo CE-MRI breast . MRI examination perform 3 Tesla scanner ( Tim trio , Siemens ) dedicate 16 channel breast coil . A combination high temporal high spatial resolution image protocol use . All patient examine prone position contrast agent ( 0.2mmol / body weight , GD-DOTA ) administer i.v . bolus follow 20 ml saline flush . Both exam ( CEDEM CE-MRI ) schedule second week menstrual cycle premenopausal woman . Each suspicious lesion undergo needle surgical biopsy ( completion CEDEM+PRIME procedure ) . Imaging finding compare finding histology . Diagnostic CEDEM+PRIME If eligible , subject complete MRI procedure undergo 4 standard view ( CC , MLO ) bilateral CEDEM examination . Due use grid-less PRIME acquisition technology AGD limit lie range standard mammogram . The high energy image acquire titanium filter . All acquire image - include unprocessed image - collect . Recombined CEDEM image create offline . Contrast agent inject bolus 2 ml/kg body weight non-ionic iodine contrast medium power injector rate 3.5ml/s follow 25ml saline flush . The CEDEM diagnostic procedure perform later 7 day least 24 hour CE-MRI procedure .</detailed_description>
