	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Assess Glycemia Chronic Kidney Disease - Changing Glucose Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proof-of-concept clinical trial test effect linagliptin versus glipizide glucose variability among people type 2 diabetes stage 3-4 CKD . In cross-over design , enrol participant receive 28 day study medication . Study medication provide randomly assign order without blind . The primary study outcome glucose time range , measure blind continuous glucose monitoring last 6 day 28-day treatment period . Secondary outcome include index glycemic variability , hypoglycemia , biomarkers systemic inflammation , oxidative stress , albuminuria . The overall goal research identify safe effective treatment control glycemia among patient diabetes CKD .</detailed_description>
