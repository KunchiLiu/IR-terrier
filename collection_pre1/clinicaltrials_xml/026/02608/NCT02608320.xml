	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , single-center , parallel-group single-application , modify 3-way crossover study . Each participant receive market reference formulation ( DURAGESIC ) JNJ-35685-AAA-G016 JNJ-35685-AAA-G021 fentanyl transdermal system ( TDS ) . The study consist screen phase within 21 2 day first TDS application first period ; partially-blinded treatment phase consist 3 single-application treatment period ; end-of-study withdrawal assessment do upon completion 72-hour adhesion assessment Day 5 Period 3 upon withdrawal . A 7- 16-day washout period separate treatment period , commence transdermal patch removal . The duration participation study individual participant 31 day maximum 68 day ( include screen follow-up visit ) . Participants primarily evaluate cumulative adhesion percentage . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
