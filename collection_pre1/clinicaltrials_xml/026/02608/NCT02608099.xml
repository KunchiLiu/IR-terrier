	<brief_title>Apixaban Evaluation Interrupted Or Uninterrupted Anticoagulation Ablation Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , Randomized Cohort Subjects undergoing ablation NVAF meet eligibility criterion sign inform consent enrol study . Subjects treat apixaban ≥21 day prior ablation procedure ( subject already apixaban ≥21 day , necessary wait 21 day ablation procedure . Apixaban dose 5 mg b.i.d . per product label , 2.5 mg b.i.d . subject 2 following : age ≥80 year , body weight ≤60 kg , serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL . Eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio 2 peri-procedural treatment strategy : - Uninterrupted treatment : administer even apixaban dose day prior procedure ; administer morning apixaban dose day procedure ; administer heparin bolus transseptal puncture maintain target activate clotting time [ ACT ] &gt; 300 second ; administer even apixaban dose procedure peri-procedural complication necessitate withhold anticoagulation long duration . - Interrupted treatment : administer even apixaban dose day prior procedure ; administer morning apixaban dose day procedure ; administer heparin bolus transseptal puncture maintain target ACT &gt; 300 second ; administer even apixaban dose procedure peri-procedural complication necessitate withhold anticoagulation long duration . Randomization take place prior procedure ( day procedure 3 day prior procedure ) stratify site . It anticipate 360 subject may enrol order evaluate total 300 randomized subject ( 150 subject per treatment arm ) : Randomized subject continue treatment apixaban 1 month post procedure . Retrospective , Warfarin Cohort In addition , chart review 300 warfarin-treated patient underwent catheter ablation NVAF September 1 , 2013 enrol center document follow-up medical record ≥ 30 day post-ablation procedure perform . Patient record warfarin-treated individual meet applicable inclusion/exclusion criterion match 1:1 subject prospective , randomized cohort age ( +/- 5 year ) , gender atrial fibrillation ( AF ) type ( paroxysmal vs. persistent ) , identify . Sites document key demographic outcome variable . This review perform blinded manner site personnel blind outcome retrospective subject subject selection process . Only pre-existing data collect analysis cohort .</detailed_description>
