	<brief_summary>This protocol represent open-label pilot study ass whether oral administration SBI subject decompensated cirrhosis ascites lead improvement management disease . The impact SBI therapy base change marker bacterial translocation , gut barrier damage , inflammation well impact rate SIBO .

	<detailed_description>The Gut Barrier Pathological Bacterial Translocation : The `` Achilles Heel '' Hepatology The intestinal wall complex barrier exists human environment . Inside intestinal lumen , commensal flora expose epithelium nearly 100 trillion bacteria.1 This epithelial layer provide surface area 400 square meter , line tight junction prevent translocation paracellular transport luminal antigen include bacteria.2 In addition mechanical barrier , wall intestine line mucosal immune defense , notably gut-associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) , large immunologic organ body.1 Under normal circumstance , functional efficient barrier prevents entry bacteria outside world . Failure intestinal barrier , along increase rate pathological bacterial translocation , show associated increase severity liver disease development decompensated cirrhosis.3 Factors think contribute bacterial translocation subject cirrhosis include small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) , know increase prevalence subject cirrhosis compare without4 , hyperdynamic portal status , alteration GALT tissue alter immune response , impaired intestinal permeability see subject ascites.3 This increase permeability believe result structural abnormality intestinal mucosa , include widen intercellular space , edema , inflammation , vascular congestion.5-7 Failure intestinal barrier routinely think play important role natural course cirrhosis , much refer hepatology 's `` Achilles heel . `` 8 Pathologic bacterial translocation across intestinal epithelium suspect impact clinical course liver cirrhosis trigger encephalopathy , hepatic failure , hepatorenal syndrome , addition long know role underlie mechanism development spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) bacterial infection population.9 Given SBP associate high mortality rate range 10-42 % ,10 subject cirrhosis increase susceptibility infection , antibiotic prophylaxis emerge widely accept strategy subject increase risk bacterial translocation , active gastrointestinal bleeding low protein content ascites . However , therapeutic strategy potential selecting resistant bacterial strain increase risk subject develop Clostridium difficile associate diarrhea . Alternative method prevention SBP bacterial infection subject cirrhosis could prove beneficial reduce mortality prevent development antibiotic resistance . In particular , prevent pathological bacterial translocation intestinal barrier could highly effective . Serum-Derived Bovine Immunoglobulin : Logical Therapy Improve Gut Barrier Function Immunoglobulins take orally know play prominent role health development give know benefit human milk colostrum , form milk produce mammal contains significant amount antibodies.11 Recognition essential nature antibody lead development commercial plasma-derived protein concentrate contain immunoglobulin , use decade animal husbandry promote growth manage intestinal inflammation immune-compromised young animals.12-14 Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin / protein isolate ( SBI ) novel medical food market brand name , EnteraGamÂ® . This product currently indicate ( see EnteraGam package insert detail ) clinical dietary management several form enteropathy , include diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS-D ) intestinal bowel disease ( IBD ) . While term , enteropathy , refers pathology disease intestine , know histological feature include blunt intestinal villus , increase intra-epithelial lymphocyte cause reduce absorptive capacity , increase gut permeability.12 In case enteropathy , combination factor include alter gut microbiota , increase intestinal inflammation , worsen gut barrier dysfunction know increase risk bacterial translocation.12 Each factor potential target SBI . In term alter gut microbiota , extensive literature demonstrate broad bacterial antigen neutralize capacity ingest immunoglobulins.15-17 Likewise , many non-clinical study show SBI reduce intestinal inflammation decrease mucosal cytokine dampen immune activation.18-19 Furthermore , available data suggest oral immunoglobulin therapy benefit tight-junction integrity epithelial barrier , evidence increase transepithelial electrical resistance reduction radiolabeled 14C-inulin permeability across intestine.19 To date , large body evidence show serum- plasma-derived bovine immunoglobulin preparation effectively manage symptom harmful effect enteropathy animal human . Animal study include data regard barrier function nutrient absorption animal include mouse , rat , pigs.12 Studies perform child show promising result term weight gain underlie problem malabsorption.22-23 Among adult , preliminary study show promising result SBI management HIV enteropathy addition diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome.24,25 Collectively , strong evidence support theory ingestion oral immunoglobulin SBI could reduce risk bacterial translocation patient cirrhosis , namely neutralize bacterial antigen intestine , reduce intestinal inflammation , decrease permeability gut barrier .</detailed_description>
