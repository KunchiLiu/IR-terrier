	<brief_summary>Aim : - The overall aim study look change see overweight obese ( overweight ) child , get thinner . - Specifically investigator interested chemical bacteria child pass urine stool look change tell u gut bodily system adapt . Hypothesis : Metabolic profile useful accurate tool observe monitor weight loss child Study plan : - To observe weight loss process child , investigator attend commercial weight loss camp call 'MORElife ' take place every year Leeds . This camp attend child age 8-17years overweight obese , two five week . It aim help lose weight structure diet , exercise , education support program . - The investigator plan , consent parent agreement child ask would kindly give u urine sample begin end time camp . For stay longer 2 week investigator also ask sample middle possible . - In addition child consent , investigator also ask small stool ( poo ) sample time point although obligation participate study affect time camp whatever decide . - Any child attend MORElife reunion ( arranged camp around 10-12 month ) agree ask final urine stool sample look long-term effect . - Each sample give code remain anonymous , frozen transport university laboratory analyze . - With permission consent investigator also collect information child , weight height camp coordinator well sample diet fed example exercise activity give full picture result accurate possible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Structured Weight-loss Programme Metabolic Profiles Obese Overweight Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN Aims : 1 . To identify effect weight-loss programme metabolic profile obese overweight child global profiling urine , intervention . 2 . To assess chemical ( metabolite ) food eaten participant compare find urine metabolomic analysis duplicate meal study . Methodology : - This observational cohort study type methodology . A cohort overweight obese child sign well-known commercial summer weight loss camp ( MORElife ) recruit parental consent . - Each child attend MORELife weight loss camp minimum 2 week maximum 5 week time either residential returning home 5 pm . - The programme consist healthy hypocaloric balance meal well exercise programme include wide range sport , team game day trip . Throughout child educate healthy eat behaviour choice give support achieve sustain change lifestyle . At end camp follow three month camp support staff via weekly telephone call check progress offer encouragement . During time thereafter also interact support team via social medium , email interactive web portal . - Sample collection metabolic profile form spot urine sample stool sample wish happy consent prove either/both . These take arrival ( Day Zero ) prior commencement weight loss programme give Control ( baseline ) sample . Thereafter 'mid-point ' sample take around half way camp final sample day leave . - Associated information child height , baseline weight arrival estimate basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) , body mass index ( BMI ) change parameter duration camp provide study camp coordinator parental permission consent . - From sample take , metabolic profile individual pre- post- intervention complete use combination untargeted targeted spectroscopic assay include : Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy Mass Spectroscopy profile chemical lipid , bile acid , amino acid , bacteria others find stool urine . - 1-2 meal eat child camp analyse also take duplicate meal puree put similar technique urine stool sample compare chemical food excrete body . Participants : At least 30 male female children/adolescents age 8 17 year overweight obese accord classification age . All child study sign MORElife summer camp 2015 Leeds , U.K provide parental consent take part . Power calculation : At present time data present impact intervention child metabolic profile calculation possible , however number investigator choose reflect similar study allow 33.3 % drop rate investigator feel confident show representative result . Health Screening : Participants assess suitability take part camp organiser weight loss camp ( MORElife ) child accept entry camp take eligible study . The investigator carry separate intervention simply collect sample time camp . Consent Participant Information : Consent form give parent child prior begin camp well information parent child read decide whether wish take part . They contact member research team time prior study information course free withdraw time agree . Sample collection : - Each child ask submit urine sample day 0 ( first day camp begin weight loss programme ) . Then regular sample collect duration time camp final one reunion around one year later . - The camp ask provide investigator duplicate lunch dinner meal give child puree prepared analysis comparison child 's metabolic profile . Withdrawal Criteria : Children pressure join study withdraw time explanation without time Summer camp affect .</detailed_description>
