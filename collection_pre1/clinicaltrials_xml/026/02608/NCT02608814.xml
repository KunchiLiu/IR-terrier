	<brief_summary>Pleural infection potentially serious infection fluid normally find around lung current evidence suggest incidence increase adult paediatric population . Identification bacterial pathogen cause pleural infection paramount importance clinical care patient currently , 40 % patient laboratory confirm microbiological diagnosis pleural infection . An unclear diagnosis due various reason small sample volume therefore aim AUDIO study ascertain capacity pleural biopsy improve microbiological yield pleural infection . Currently , well validate method identify patient present pleural infection basis initial ultrasound image . The AUDIO study define role baseline thoracic ultrasound predict radiographic , clinical surgical outcome patient pleural infection . The AUDIO study aim recruit 50 patient 2 centre specific pleural expertise patient follow 12 month period .
