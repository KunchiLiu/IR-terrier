	<brief_summary>Premature birth deprive infant sensory stimulation . Tactile stimulation massage pressure kinesthetic movement significantly increase weight , bone density shorten duration stay premature baby benefit . Studies use vegetable oil show increase effect weight gain cutaneous absorption . The mechanism probably vagal ( stimulation baroreceptor skin mechanoreceptors ) since find child stimulate increase vagal activity , acceleration gastric empty increase secretion insulin IGF1 . Few study evaluate effect massage medium-term neurological development preterm infant effect essential oil effectiveness touch short medium term massage . The aim investigator study evaluate neurological development short medium term premature newborns biological effect massage essential use vegetable oil . Methodology possible collaboration This monocentric , randomize , control , neonatal intensive care unit . It concern 60 child bear 26 30 week amenorrhea . Each child receive massage randomize without oil ISIO 4 . The treatment administer 10 minute twice day 10 consecutive day watch sign intolerance . The quality spontaneous motility 12 20 week age correct use first neurological assessment criterion . The questionnaire ( ASQ ) Bricker Squires ( translate French Martha Bonin et al . ) use 6 , 12 , 24 month correct age complete parent second neurological endpoint . A lipid chromatography perform begin end massage time deliverance NICU compare profile child 's fatty acid . Expected result Show improvement neurological development child receive massage vegetable oil ISIO 4 . Show skin absorption essential fatty acid substitute know major deficiency premature even infant feed breast milk .</brief_summary>
