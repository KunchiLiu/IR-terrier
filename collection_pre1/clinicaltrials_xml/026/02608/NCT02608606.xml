	<brief_summary>After liver transplantation one important cost , patient health insurance system , immunosuppressive drug therapy . Tacrolimus ( FK 506 ) consider cornerstone immunosuppressive therapy solid organ transplantation . Oral administration usual route , however , sublingual ( SL ) administration recently report . This method administration avoids first pas metabolism allow alternative route transplant surgery , particularly patient extend period fasting ( prolonged intubation , ileus , etc ) . Interestingly , study , dose tacrolimus SL require maintain similar plasma concentration compare oral administration , significantly low , even 50 % , result considerable saving short long term . Among study , one conduct liver recipient . This study suggest SL administration tacrolimus could allow obtain similar concentration compare oral administration . The design study ass existence difference dose require included six patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient schedule fast liver transplant unit pharmacokinetic study perform . After installation venous needle , blood sample collect 4 ml tube EDTA anticoagulant follow interval time hour : 0 ( immediately oral administration tacrolimus ) ; 0.5 ; 1.0 ; 1.5 ; 2 ; 4 ; 6 ; 9 12 h. post-dose . Once blood sample take , tube plug , invest gently mix anticoagulant store -20 Â° C analysis . Subsequently , tacrolimus administration change sublingual route dose adjust obtain similar trough level determine per oral administration . The capsule open content shall deposit sublingual mucosa . To ensure drug absorted patient instruct insistently sublingual placement drug , swallow capsule content least 15 minute . The pharmacokinetic study describe oral route perform . Breakfast administer 2 hour ingest drug lunch dinner 6 10 hour respectively . Fluid intake discretionary .</detailed_description>
