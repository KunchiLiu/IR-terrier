	<brief_summary>A pilot study conduct , randomize , triple-blind study allocation concealment . Which consist application KT anterior tibial muscle 24 hour . 14 subject randomize 2 group : intervention ( voltage ) sham ( pressure ) . Patient 's gait footage shot opening balance phase , average balance initial contact ( first without application Kinesio Taping 24 hour application ) measure angle ankle joint , knee hip . Balance assess Biodex Balance System platform , configure analyze postural stability level eight . The mean difference assess ( MD ) group confidence interval ( CI ) 95 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Kinesio Taping® Paretic Tibialis Anterior Muscle During Patient Gait Balance After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sample select list patient wait care Kinesiology Laboratory Functional Assessment Department Physical Therapy , Federal University Pernambuco - UFPE operation perform . In period May July 2014 . The study approve Ethics Committee Research Human be Health Sciences Center UFPE , CAAE 15238913.9.0000.5208 . On admission , patient inform research , meet free informed consent . Randomization take randomization.com site , allocation concealment do opaque seal envelope . Procedures application Kinesio Taping As protocol , intervention group sham group underwent way care skin preparation . Trichotomy , necessary hold ; skin clean alcohol dry paper towel . They use reference point proximal fibular head tibial tuberosity ( point A ) apex first metatarsal ( Point B ) . The experimental group receive voltage activate muscle position receive application KT accordance manual tap kinesio - Kenzo Kase method . And one tape mark use , recommend Kinesio Taping Association . KT application intervention group The patient place stretcher supine position , ankle position plantar flexion inversion ( maximum amplitude achieve passively patient ) , measure hold Point A B tape measure , immediately KT remove paper cut extent . The KT pull maximum limit measure tape second evaluator . This measure find maximum tensile strain represent 100 % rule three apply order find 35 % voltage muscle activation . The tension KT calculate ensure approximate voltage participant intervention group . After find measure 35 % strain centimeter , evaluator cut KT measurement discard . Finally tape position Point A ; pull Point B ; fix . This procedure carry ankle position plantar flexion inversion , maximum amplitude achieve passively patient . KT application sham group The sham group receive tape apply without tension . The patient position supine ; ankle place neutral position ( 90 degree ) ; measure Point A Point B tape measure place skin perform . Once registered measure centimeter evaluator cut KT measure , without presence paper attach ensure tension , KT need minimum voltage apply paper . After measure cut KT , apply patient supine position ankle position 90 degree traction . Images funding procedure The patient marker ( pressure ball ) low limb predetermine anatomical point : head fifth metatarsal , midpoint lateral malleolus , head fibula , lateral femoral condyle great trochanter femur . They record image Digital Camcorder ( CANON PowerShot A2600 ) fix tripod . Environmental calibration perform board calibration 120 cm high , tag 60 cm , calibrate midpoint focus camcorder . During record film right left profile patient . This dressed short contain side screen , allow view palpation anatomical point already mention . After receive marker anatomical point patient encourage walk flat track eight meter long three time , two central meter use . The 1ºgravação carry without application KT patient instruct walk normal pace march . After application KT patient return release 24 hour . They place marker pre-determined anatomical point patient encourage walk track normal rhythm march 2nd record take place condition first day . 1 . Balance evaluation The tool use assess postural balance Biodex Balance System , device use order check / train close kinetic chain static dynamic postural stability patient one foot bipedal . The apparatus consist two component : adjustable platform 12 different level stability , `` 1 '' unstable level `` 12 '' static level display , give feedback location center mass individual . The level use Postural Stability test 8 ( follow manual protocol ) provide low loss balance postural adjustment patient use ankle strategy , great participation gastrocnemius muscle previous imbalance tibialis anterior subsequent imbalance . The display demonstrate point screen center pressure patient displacement attribute balance body quantify CP movement anterior / posterior direction ( generate index anterior / posterior stability : IAP ) medial / side ( generate medial stability index / side : IML ) together IAP IML result general stability index ( GSE ) , high value high index body swing , ie , great instability patient . In addition provide percentage evaluation time within zone ( A , B , C D ) quadrant ( I , II , III IV ) . The assessment balance BBS use level 8 test Postural Stability . The test perform three time duration 20 second , 10 second interval repetition , first evaluation , four replication exclude first reduce potential effect learn . The result consider final average three test variable . All value save computer record spreadsheet evaluator . To carry balance test , age patient 's height record equipment , participant ask rise BBS platform position foot also record . Was ask patient adopt comfortable posture arm along body , move foot place throughout test , put ball center picture look phone 's display throughout duration evaluation . Satisfaction Rating Twenty-four hour application patient return service KT remove . Then patient ask satisfaction use Kinesio question : `` Did notice positive difference regard use KT facilitate walk ? `` . For answer patient two option `` yes '' `` . '' And could express verbally positive difference . Analysis image The image capture sagittal plane video form transfer computer analyze Free Software Tracker - Tool analysis physical modeling video . The software use analyze joint angle knee , hip ankle . They select frame three gait phase : opening balance , average balance initial contact . At stage mark angle ankle , knee hip ; angle measure 3 time produce average angular . The image calibration do software use tag center track black 60 cm length . Statistical analysis Data tabulate Microsoft Office Excel 2007 review researcher blind status group . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS 13.0 Windows version . To characterize sample use descriptive analysis use measure central tendency ( mean ) dispersion ( standard deviation ) quantitative variable frequency categorical variable . Due small sample size , non-parametric test use . For intergroup analysis perform Mann-Whitney test intra-group analysis do Wilcoxon obtain difference group respective confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) . The level significance statistical difference p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
