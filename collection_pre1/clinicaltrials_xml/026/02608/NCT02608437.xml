	<brief_summary>Thi pahse I , dose-escalation trial determine MTD , safety additional benefit achieve add SGI-110 ipilimumab therapy metastatic melanoma patient . Preclinical evidence generate SGI-110 vivo demonstrate besides direct activity tumor growth single agent , SGI-110 able `` sensitize '' neoplastic cell anti-tumor activity CTLA-4 blockade , provide sound scientific rationale develop new immunotherapeutic approach combine SGI-110 therapeutic mAb immune check-points .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Investigating SGI-110 Combination With Ipilimumab Unresectable Metastatic Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epigenetic alteration play pivotal role cancer development progression . Pharmacologic reversion alteration feasible , second generation `` epigenetic drug '' development demonstrate possess significant immunomodulatory property . This knowledge , together availability new highly effective immuno-therapeutic agent include immune check-point ( ) block monoclonal antibody , allow u plan highly innovative proof-of-principle combination study likely open path effective anti-cancer therapy . Targeting immune check-point ( ) immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) novel rapidly evolve strategy treat cancer , rapidly spread different tumor histology . The prototype approach therapeutic modality relies inhibition negative signal deliver CTLA-4 express T lymphocyte . CTLA-4 blockade profoundly change therapeutic landscape metastatic melanoma ( MM ) , significantly improve survival MM patient ; however , objective clinical response limit , minority patient achieve long-term disease control.1 Therefore , several combination approach explore improve efficacy CTLA-4 blockade . Along line , base preclinical evidence investigator gain broad immunomodulatory activity SGI-110 , exploratory phase 1 combination study NIBIT-M4 design provide proof-of-concept evidence immunologic clinical efficacy CTLA-4 blockade combine DNA-HypomethylatingAgent ( DHA ) . Progressing Stage III Stage IV MM patient , amenable serial tumor biopsy enrol study .</detailed_description>
