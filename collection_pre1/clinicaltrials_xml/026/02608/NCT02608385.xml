	<criteria>1 . Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . 2 . Be 18 year age day sign informed consent . 3 . Have histologically confirm advanced solid tumor curative treatment available . In expansion subject must either renal cell carcinoma lung cancer . 4 . Have undergone appropriate standard care treatment option ( opinion treat investigator ) . Patients NSCLC must undergo EGFR ALK test receive appropriate initial therapy . 5 . Have measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 include least two tumor lesion meet criterion SBRT radiation . &lt; 65 cc viable metastasis ( approximately 5cm dimension ) Metastases locate lung , liver , mediastinal/cervical node , Spinal/Paraspinal , Osseous , abdominalpelvic ( lymph node/adrenal gland ) The two lesion must ≥5cm apart measure edge tumor edge tumor . 6 . For first 18 patient : Be willing undergo repeat biopsy tumor lesion treatment radiation . Subjects newlyobtained sample provide ( e.g . inaccessible subject safety concern ) may exempt requirement consultation Principal Investigator . 7 . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . 8 . Demonstrate adequate organ function 9 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 10 . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 5.7.2 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . 11 . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . 1 . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . 2 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy dose &gt; 10 mg Prednisone daily equivalent time first dose trial treatment . 3 . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) 4 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 5 . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 6 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 7 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . 8 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . 9 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 10 . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 11 . Has active infection require systemic therapy . 12 . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . 13 . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . 14 . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . 15 . If know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA qualitative detect ) patient eligible cohort include SBRT liver lesion . 16 . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow , however intranasal influenza vaccine live attenuate vaccine allow . 17 . Has prior radiation therapy ( define &gt; 1Gy ) area planning treat SBRT</criteria>
