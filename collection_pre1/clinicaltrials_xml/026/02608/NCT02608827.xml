	<brief_summary>Hypertension serious health problem Brazil affect almost 30 % adult population . It known pharmacologic nonpharmacologic strategy treat hypertension . Aerobic exercise slow breathe nonpharmacologic method reduce blood pressure isolate form , combination never study . The aim study evaluate association strategy also mechanisms involve blood pressure reduction use slow breathing , stag 1 2 hypertensive .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sympathetic Blood Pressure Responses Aerobic Exercise Guided Respiration Hypertensives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination drug medication hypertension treatment widely recommend , emphasis aerobic exercise ( EXE ) , relaxation exercise , use equipment design decrease respiratory rate call Resperate® . This intervention demonstrate hypotensive effect pressure measurement clinical blood pressure ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) home blood pressure monitoring ( HBPM ) . It unknown ; however , slow breathing ( GRL ) associate intervention , EXE , example , may potentiate blood pressure ( BP ) reduction . The aim study evaluate acute response muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA ) BP , association slow breathing versus control ( listen calm music ) 24 hour blood pressure response association EXE GRL . Twenty hypertensives evaluate 18 60 year old , mens woman , sedentary , non-obese , without target organ damage associate comorbidities , 4 week placebo use ( washout period ) . Participants randomly divide 2 group ( GRL GC ) perform EXE cycle ergometer . Volunteers make ABPM experimental session . In session record 10 minute , prior physical exercise , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) , respiratory rate ( RR ) heart rate ( HR ) , , It hold microneurography register also MSNA 10 minute , perform either GRL listen music 15 minute . Variables measure 10 minute . After finish session , volunteer put ABPM go away .</detailed_description>
