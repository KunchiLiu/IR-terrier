	<brief_summary>Background : Brain activity create waste product . The body glymphatic system remove waste , especially sleep . One brain waste product amyloid-beta ( Ab ) . It play role Alzheimer disease . Researchers want study effect sleep Ab brain . Objective : To see sleep affect amount waste product remove brain . Eligibility : Healthy people least 18 year age . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They answer question drug use , psychiatric history , family history alcoholism drug use . Participants complete MRI screening questionnaire . Participants stay clinic overnight two time . On one night sleep night . On night kept awake night . These overnight visit happen order . Participants wear 2 activity monitor , wrist ankle . Participants positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . A small amount radioactive chemical inject intravenous ( IV ) catheter . Participants lie bed slide scanner . A cap special mask may place participant head . Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . The MRI scanner metal cylinder strong magnetic field . Participants lie table slide cylinder . A device call coil place head . Participants task computer screen scanner . Participants test think , memory , attention . They may interview , complete questionnaire , take pen-and-paper computer test , perform simple action .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Amyloid- Retention During Wakefulness Following Emergence From Sleep Healthy People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To assess difference [ 18F ] florbetaben uptake follow first 120 minute injection ( reflect amyloid-beta Ab load and/or dock Ab ) subject rested wakefulness ( RW ) normal sleep compare wakefulness 24 hr sleep deprivation ( SD ) . Specifically , hypothesize RW normal night sleep less [ 18F ] florbetaben binding measure distribution volume ratio ( DVR ) precuneus relative cerebellum ( reflect normal brain clearing Ab overnight ) compare wakefulness SD , would interfere Ab removal brain interstitial space . Though measure Ab whole brain analysis focus precuneus since brain region show high level Ab accumulation contrast cerebellum accumulation Ab . Therefore , overall Ab load precuneus ( reflect [ 18F ] florbetaben DVR ) low RW compare SD . MRI 1H-MRS use secondarily assess difference connectivity , function neurochemistry precuneus RW SD . Because rate CSF production well Ab clearance CSF differs function age current study also allow u ass high Ab brain level report old young individual reflect great Ab clearance young old individual . Study population : Two group consist healthy young adult ( 18 - 40 year age ) healthy old adult ( &gt; 40 year age ) . Males female include . Design : Observational study . We complete test 15 healthy control group total thirty subject ( n=30 ) ass brain uptake [ 18F ] florbetaben ( scan do 120 minute follow tracer injection ) . The order scan ( RW vs SD randomize ) . MRI scan obtain either PET scan session do follow [ 18F ] florbetaben injection . Outcome measure : Uptake [ 18F ] florbetaben brain measure RW SD . Primary outcome difference uptake clearance [ 18F ] florbetaben precuneus ( reflect A beta load and/or dock A beta ) subject SD compare RW measure distribution volume ratio use cerebellum reference region clearance Ab brain ( difference RW SD ) great young old participant . We hypothesize Ab load precuneus [ 18F ] florbetaben DVR ) high SD RW difference large young old participant . We also predict old individual higher brain accumulation Ab young one . In addition ass difference mean water diffusivity brain , lactate concentration , functional connectivity rest functional activation attention task RW SD condition . We predict low fMRI signal dorsal attention network ( DAN ) attention task , low functional connectivity default mode network ( DMN ) , low functional connectivity mean diffusivity SD RW . We predict high concentration lactate , marker anaerobic metabolism SD RW . As exploratory analysis also assess base scan obtain RW individual higher brain Ab accumulation worse cognitive performance neuropsychological test low brain Ab .</detailed_description>
