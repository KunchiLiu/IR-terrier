	<brief_summary>The main goal study test two new radioactive drug , 4- [ 18F ] fluoro-meta-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ( [ 18F ] 4F-MHPG ) 3- [ 18F ] fluoro-para-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ( [ 18F ] 3F-PHPG ) human subject congestive heart failure . Evaluations image agent include uptake heart , lung liver , metabolic breakdown blood , kinetics heart . Based study , good two drug choose study patient heart disease . After good compound chosen , additional measure image property , metabolism pharmacokinetics do subject heart failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study 18F-Labeled Hydroxyphenethylguanidines Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human heart contain many nerve fiber involve control heart 's pumping function . Several heart diseases show damage nerve heart . Studies show damage heart nerve may cause death patient diseases like heart failure diabetes . Two new radioactive drug develop University Michigan take picture nerve fiber heart use medical imaging method call positron emission tomography ( PET ) . These two drug 4- [ 18F ] fluoro-meta-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ( [ 18F ] 4F-MHPG ) 3- [ 18F ] fluoro-para-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ( [ 18F ] 3F-PHPG ) . Initial PET image study normal human subject ( see NCT 02385877 ) show [ 18F ] 4F-MHPG [ 18F ] 3F-PHPG able provide detail regional map distribution nerve fiber heart . In Stage 1 study , enrol subject heart failure undergo PET study [ 18F ] 4F-MHPG [ 18F ] 3F-PHPG allow direct comparison image property , metabolism pharmacokinetics two radioactive drug subject . A third PET scan [ 13N ] ammonia do ass rest blood flow different area heart . The result study use select good two tracer study patient heart disease . In Stage 2 study , enrol subject heart failure undergo additional PET evaluation image property kinetics cardiac nerve tracer select Stage 1 ( either [ 18F ] 4F-MHPG [ 18F ] 3F-PHPG ) . Again , PET scan [ 13N ] ammonia also perform measure regional resting blood flow . A third PET scan [ 11C ] meta-hydroxyephedrine ( [ 11C ] HED ) , establish cardiac nerve tracer , also do address research question related mechanism involve retention [ 18F ] 4F-MHPG [ 18F ] 3F-PHPG inside nerve heart . For study stage , subject assess scan heart rate , blood pressure oxygen saturation . Patients follow 30 min , 24 hour 30 hour regard adverse event serious adverse event might experience . These report require .</detailed_description>
