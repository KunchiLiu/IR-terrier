	<brief_summary>This study evaluate ADCT-402 patient Relapsed Refractory B-cell Lineage Non Hodgkin Lymphoma ( B-NHL ) . Patients participate dose-escalation phase ( Part 1 ) dose expansion ( Part 2 ) . In Part 2 , patient receive dose level identify Part 1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study ADCT-402 Patients With Relapsed Refractory B-cell Lineage Non Hodgkin Lymphoma ( B-NHL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study ADCT-402-101 first clinical study ADCT-402 patient B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) . ADCT-402 antibody drug conjugate ( ADC ) compose humanize antibody direct human cluster differentiation 19 ( CD19 ) , stochastically conjugate via valine-alanine cleavable , maleimide linker pyrrolobenzodiazepine ( PBD ) dimer cytotoxin . The study conduct 2 part . In Part 1 ( dose escalation ) patient receive infusion ADCT-402 , escalate dos . Part 1 continue maximum tolerate dose determine . In Part 2 ( expansion ) , patient assign recommended dose level ADCT-402 identify Part 1 Dose Escalation Steering Committee . For patient , study include screen period ( 28 day ) , treatment period ( withdrawal ) , follow-up period ass disease progression survival 12 month last dose study drug . The total study duration dependent overall patient tolerability study drug response treatment . It anticipate duration entire study ( Parts 1 2 ) could approximately 3 year first patient treat last patient complete .</detailed_description>
