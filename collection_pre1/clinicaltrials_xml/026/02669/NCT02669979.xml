	<detailed_description>Background : An increase number research publication point association oral general health . There report association oral infection , coronary disease , diabetes respiratory tract infection also high oral opportunistic micro flora increase mortality frail elderly individual . It important develop oral care method effectively prevent growth opportunistic micro flora och oral disease . Especially important preventive method old dependent individual vulnerable patient group limited possibility access relevant oral health care . Professional oral care see effective method prevent dental diseases caries periodontal problem elderly new National guideline dentistry point scientific proof effect professional oral care , besides ordinary daily oral care grownup . This conclusion could translate frail elderly dependent help nursing staff receive perform daily oral hygiene . The effect domiciliary oral care knowledge , explore . This type care rather simple equipment perform good quality , advance dental care may present restriction home environment . However , Swedish dental system subsidize dental care dependent elderly patient , restriction number prophylactic oral care treatment . The level vary different county region . The rationale probably tradition economy scientific evidence lacking . Aim : The aim develop evaluate domiciliary prophylactic professional oral care . The researcher compare effect different regimen domiciliary prophylactic professional oral care oral health dependent elderly , accord content frequency . The overall aim establish relevant recommendation domiciliary prophylactic professional oral care . Project plan : Design : The project design randomise , double blind , clinical study two parallel study arm . Randomisation perform group level ( ward unit ) , blind researcher participant ( allocation concealment ) . Data analysis make individual level present group level . Appliance Ethical permission make approve first part study already perform complete approval continue part study . Pilot study : Before main clinical study start , pilot study perform three month ( half time main study ) test relevance study protocol , sample size also possible difference oral health effect hands-on-work include professional oral care compare information instruction . The pilot study perform 96 individual include randomly receive professional oral care dental hygienist month , information re-instruction oral care together daily care staff month serve control . They receive baseline effect registration select number variable cover purpose pilot study . Participants The main study plan include 366 ( 2 x150 + 18 % compensation estimate drop out ) dependent elderly individual nursing home . Inclusion criterion : least 10 natural fix teeth inclusively osseointegrated implant , non smoker , ability cooperate oral assessment 5-10 minute able answer Oral Health Related Quality Life formula . Exclusion criterion : edentulousness full denture , cognitive limitation obstacle cooperation , malignancy and/or immunosuppressive disease , coagulation defect . Anticoagulants register exclusion criterion . The participant consecutively recruit sorted ward research group inform consent - eventually help advocate , ( ward research group decide chance first participant ward recruit ) . A control group without professional oral care 6 month , include main study , see good ethic collect data without offer oral care . Besides , `` ordinary care '' , either elderly nursing staff , vary . This confound factor project far possible controlled give recommendation routine daily oral care include ward participant . In accordance ethical rule , participant interrupt participation without explanation negative consequence . Sample size power estimation : The sample size base power calculation least amount individual group detect significant difference 7 % concern bleed probe ( BoP ) group ( cluster randomisation block ward level diminish unbalance number individual ward ) , risks Type-I Type-II estimate alpha =0.05 beta =0.20 . For primary effect variable , BoP ( 17 ) , 150 individual group require . Due high mortality study group ( 30 % year ) drop illness , sample increase 18 % . Accordingly , number participant n=366 ( 183 group ) . When drop out , data analysis perform due intention-to-treat method . Intervention : All involved ward , nurse staff relative inform meeting project present explain . At occasion , questionnaire distribute nursing staff explore knowledge opinion oral health care . Standard rule daily oral hygiene study period set . As far possible , oral care circumstance similar include study ward . Products contain chlorhexidine set two week study start . At baseline participant oral assessment together medical report include drug use , deliver register nurse . On subgroup consist 100 individual ( 50 study arm ) , oral micro flora measure sample collect supra gingival plaque sterile toothpick . The total number microorganism grow proportion ) lactobacilli streptococcus mutans b ) opportunistic bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus candida calculate . As participant suppose eligible free oral assessment home necessary dental care , write oral care card update routine actual study period . The exact performance routine establish pilot study evaluate . Intervention research group professional oral care electric tooth brush ( Braun Oral-B ) , `` ordinary '' fluoridate tooth paste ( 1100-1450 ppm NaF ) , repeat oral care instruction participant staff ( contact person ) supra gingival depuration necessary , fluor varnish delivery saliva stimulate replace product participant show stimulated salivation le 1,0 ml/minute . All group continue period 12 month . If electric tooth brush tolerate , ordinary suitable tooth brush , choose dental hygienist , use . Group A receive treatment month , Group B receive additional treatment ( control ) . Each participant ask brush teeth every morning even `` ordinary '' fluoridate tooth paste ( 1100-1450 ppm NaF ) . Questions related chew ability oral health relate quality life ask due Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index ( GOHAI ) , well question aim evaluate domiciliary professional oral care experience participant . Clinical registration due study protocol ( see : effect variable ) , perform calibrated dental staff ( dentist dental hygienist ) baseline , three month six month three study group . The dental staff also get opinion compliance recommend routine product help question participant nursing staff . The exact construction question make project period , validate formula available . A coordinator require monitor include researcher concern commitment study protocol handle unforeseeable event , like patient safety , complaint , complication . Any treatment complication suspect report , registred project leader act upon relevant way . If participant need dental care besides project activity supply , also report handled project leader . Effect variable : Primary effect variable : bleeding probing ( BoP ) gingival sulcus buccal surface concern teeth 13 , 12 , 11 , 21 , 23 , 33 , 32 , 31 , 41 , 43 near comparable teeth . The bleeding score four level ( 0-3 ) due Modified Sulcus Bleeding Index . The measurement perform baseline three third month study group . Comparison make group level . Secondary effect variable : Manifest caries registred tooth analysis unit DT Measurements perform baseline third month study group . Oral hygiene : Mucosal plaque index , MPS , use fix teeth partial removable denture . The measurement perform baseline third month study groups.. Oral micro flora : The oral micro flora measure sample collect teeth mention accord BoP . The measurement perform baseline six month group sub sample 50 group . Tertiary effect variable : Number episodes respiratory tract infection , pneumonia use antibiotic . Data collect registered nurse . Measurements perform baseline six month group . Oral Health Related Quality Life also measure GOHAI , baseline six month . For related nursing staff , two formula use measure knowledge attitudes oral health , baseline six month . Significance : Newly submit data professor Maude Wikström research group , inclusive main applicant Inger Wårdh , point extensive oral hygiene routine may effective remove dental plaque opportunistic pathogen . This could probably cause oral dryness data also point need stimulate flow 1,0 ml/min pathogenic oral flora disappear , probably due self-cleaning effect saliva . An important part professional oral health care would therefore supply saliva stimulate replacing product . Ongoing research also point ought use product purpose receive high pH-level oral cavity .It lack knowledge accord content frequency professional oral care dependent elderly consequently neither ought subsidized government . However , first step important create good routine domiciliary professional oral care , project able . The result publish scientific journal also plan use PhD thesis two master thesis .</detailed_description>
