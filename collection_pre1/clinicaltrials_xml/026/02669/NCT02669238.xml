	<brief_summary>Endometriosis chronic relapse disease characterize presence proliferation endometrial gland stroma outside uterus . This serious disease , widespread , difficult live patient , also difficult treat practitioner take care patient . It affect 1.6 % general population , incidence 10 time high ( 40 % ) patient infertility . It occur mainly complex chronic pelvic pain negative influence fertility . It disease whose complexity explain four level . Firstly , extremely polymorphic character intraperitoneal superficial form , ovarian form deep sub-peritoneal form . Secondly plurality main symptom individually non-specific frequency / intensity correlate severity disease . This non-specificity symptom partially explain long lead misdiagnosis , vary 5 11 year . Thirdly , prevalence seem high largely underestimated . If precise estimate general population complicate , seem high many study patient support surgically gynecological reason . These large prevalence figure observe consultation support hypothesis widespread probably insufficiently evaluate disease . Lately management , insufficiently amend , currently scientifically support recommendation . Chronic pain cause disease associate altered sexuality loss fertility significantly impact quality life patient .</brief_summary>
