	<detailed_description>Two study finding lead conflictive point view .

It might early proclaim routine Fallopian tube removal long data much procedure affect ovarian function . This support another statement study `` Although malignant serous `` ovarian '' carcinoma originate distal Fallopian tube , small proportion serous cancer well endometroid , clear cell , mucinous carcinoma still think arise ovarian surface epithelium.1 '' mean exact impact cancer prophylaxis estimate due lack study . Other histopathologic entity might influence tube removal .</detailed_description>
