	<brief_summary>It well recognize subset patient contract Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) spontaneously clear virus . Such individual anti-HCV antibody positive , yet HCV RNA PCR negative blood . While consider candidate live kidney donation past , recent availability novel anti-HCV drug &gt; 95 % cure rate , represent potential pool donor candidate , especially since risk transmission HCV recipient extremely low .

	<brief_title>Live Kidney Donors With Positive Anti-HCV Antibody , But Negative HCV PCR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals test positive anti-HCV IgG antibody , negative blood HCV RNA PCR generally consider infected HCV clear virus spontaneously . However , due general conservative approach live donor kidney transplant program , individual consider potential live kidney donor , despite consider extremely low risk HCV transmission recipient . This reluctance stem past experience post-transplant HCV complication , hepatic ( e.g . cirrhosis ) extra-hepatic ( e.g . transplant glomerulonephritis ) fact historical mainstay HCV treatment , interferon , poorly tolerate , low cure rate , cause transplant rejection . Now , however , highly effective novel therapeutic may transform way transplant physicians patient think HCV-positive donated kidney . With new agent , current cure rate HCV exceed 95 % . A recent report demonstrate high cure rate even liver transplant setting , suggest immunosuppression impede eradication interaction HCV transplant drug successfully manage . Thus , risk transmission infection anti-HCV antibody positive , HCV PCR-negative known , transmission occur , treatment possible , point transplant professional begin advocate use anti-HCV Ab positive individual donor HCV-negative recipient . A group Barcelona report transplantation live donor kidney donor treat anti-HCV regimen achieve sustained virological response spouse transmission infection . The main area concern seem describe `` occult HCV infection '' - presence HCV RNA peripheral blood mononuclear cell organ tissue ultrasensitive assay absence detectable RNA serum . However , entity controversial , significance uncertain , inadequately describe risk transmission . If HCV transmit successfully treat , another concern potential residual risk viral complication , even though evident previous trial . Finally , major concern financial , HCV treatment currently cost $ 80,000 3-month regimen . However , chronic hemodialysis cost upwards $ 100,000 per year cost consider , kidney transplantation cost $ 20,000 per year first year . Thus , time , even treatment CMV infection , require , kidney transplantation would result overall cost saving health care system . Given unknown , though generally consider low risk transmission HCV antibody-positive , PCR-negative individual , combine wide availability effective treatment HCV infection , felt recipient expose high risk infection transplant . Furthermore , small risk need weigh risk stay dialysis , carry mortality rate 6.5-7.4 time general population 4.6-5.9 time renal transplant population . The case become even compelling consider patient high risk deterioration continue dialysis ( elderly , diabetic , cardiovascular disease ) , disadvantageous blood type , broad sensitization , extremely limited compatible donor option . Given proven survival benefit kidney transplantation patient chronic HCV , ample reason believe provide HCV positive kidney HCV therapy ( indeed require ) HCV negative recipient lead good outcome associated remain dialysis .</detailed_description>
