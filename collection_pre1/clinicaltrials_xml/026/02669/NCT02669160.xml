	<brief_summary>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) include sensorimotor development disorder lead balance , gait movement disruption . These disorder relate lesion central nervous system ( CNS ) occur birth early childhood . The therapeutic management CP essentially base reeducation , may also require specific medical treatment , orthopedic device sometimes bone surgery . Therefore , CP child often place specialized institution significant socioeconomic impact . CP child suffer various sensorimotor impairment , may evolve orthopedic deformation , justify implementation restrictive device . The French High Authority Health ( HAS ) estimate 50 % CP child pain use contention verticalization device . These pain mainly nociceptive cause passive constraint apply contact point . Many clinical trial evaluate physiotherapy benefit CP patient lead controversial result regard duration effect therapeutic approach . However , improvement important neuromuscular facilitation technique added reeducation program . Human neuronal adaptation plasticity mechanisms understood , possibility potential partial recovery . Non-invasive stimulation method neurorehabilitation technique could participate CNS re-calibration . Automated assist movement already use process show increase joint range motion , bone density decrease spasticity . In recent year , `` exoskeleton '' device use subject spinal cord injury allow motor performance improvement . This pilot study aim evaluate CP child 's tolerance motorize orthosis reproduce walk pattern compare conventional passive standing-up device . For clinical trial , investigator compare behavior CP child use motorize orthosis reproduce walk pattern ( Innowalk Pro Small ) behavior child place usual conventional passive device . The investigator hypothesis Innowalk improve joint range motion , enhance selective motor control , decrease medium-term spasticity offer least tolerance conventional passive device .</brief_summary>
