	<brief_summary>Severe malaria bacterial Blood Stream Infections ( bBSI ) impossible differentiate clinically . This pose particular threat low resource area , bBSI often diagnose due unavailability rapid diagnostic mean . Even use appropriately , sensitivity blood culture diagnose bBSI estimate around 50 % . To counter high mortality rate associate bBSI , antibiotic often prescribe without microbiological confirmation . Sysmex Company develop technology enables rapid diagnosis malaria use venous blood sample . In addition algorithm base hematological parameter use monitor disease severity progression , well guide diagnostic test base difference see parameter various type disease . The algorithm develop test adult population different industrialized country one Asian population . However data available neither pediatric patient , sub-Saharan set epidemiology infectious disease different test setting . The objective study : 1 ) Assess sensitivity specificity Sysmex hematology analyzer base new technology diagnose malaria subject older 3 month , present acute severe febrile illness malaria endemic area sub-Saharan Africa 2 ) Test optimize value Sysmex analyzer disease diagnosis monitoring child older 5 year adults , present acute severe febrile illness malaria endemic region sub-Saharan Africa , differentiate severe malaria bBSI , combination infection . 3 ) Explore value Sysmex analyzer disease diagnosis monitoring child 3 month 5 year age , present acute severe febrile illness malaria endemic region sub-Saharan Africa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Analytical plan Sysmex blind : - All clinical data except age gender participant - All laboratory image data obtain XN-analyzers . The clinical study team blind : - Data XN-analyzers , except currently validate data use routine patient care ( e.g . total blood count , white blood differentiation ) Two researcher Sysmex two researcher study team use data available ( i.e . data blind ) categorize patient accord follow category ( independently ) use predefined case definition mention . 1 . Confirmed malaria parasitemia 2 . Confirmed bacterial infection 3 . Confirmed viral infection 4 . Suspected malaria 5 . Suspected bacterial infection 6 . Suspected viral infection 7 . Mixed infection ( specify combination ) 8 . No infection Analysis primary outcome measure 1 . Diagnostic sensitivity specificity blue laser compare microscopy/PCR 2 . ROC curve ass best cut-off blue laser base clinical sample 3 . Linear regression analysis compare quantification parasitemia blue laser microscopy/PCR 4 . Compare performance blue laser performance RDT ( comparison microscopy/PCR ) 5 . Diagnostic sensitivity specificity infection manager detect bBSI participant 5 year old . 6 . Diagnostic sensitivity specificity infection manager detect bBSI combine malaria participant 5 year old . Case definition : Malaria parasitemia define presence one parasites malaria microscopy malaria qPCR 18S result 50 p/ml Bacterial bloodstream infection define growth clinically significant bacterial organism blood culture within 5 day incubation ( 16 ) PCR result positive clinically significant organism Lower respiratory tract infection : clinical suspicion include cough and/or shortness breath , support result chest exam chest X-ray . Abscess : case superficial abscess clinical presentation must confirm pu upon drainage . In case deep abscess clinical presentation must confirm echography . Meningitis : A clinical suspicion decrease conscience neck stiffness , confirmed culture agglutination perform cerebrospinal fluid . Pelvic inflammatory infection : Typical clinical presentation vaginal discharge Protrude skin infection : clinical presentation combine grown pathogen skin culture presence pu . Bacterial gastro-enteritis : Patients diarrhoea grown pathogen stool culture . Urinary tract infection : Patients clinical sign urinary tract infection grow pathogen urine culture . Obvious cause fever include superficial skin infection , superficial abscess , otitis , pharyngitis tonsillitis . Viral infection diagnose base clinical suspicion confirm use PCR serology .</detailed_description>
