	<detailed_description>The incidence breast cancer Chinese woman low Western population . Breast cancer common cancer Chinese woman incidence rise . Moreover premenopausal woman breast cancer breast cancer incidence peak forty postmenopausal rise incidence less commonly see . As genetic predisposition breast cancer increasingly understood , suggest difference breast cancer incidence different ethnic population potentially due interaction lifestyle genetic characteristic . To date , use Agendia 's gene expression assay Chinese woman study . In study , feasibility gene-expression prognostic assay risk assessment specific group assess . Moreover , specific molecular characteristic potential biomarkers study , focus especially large group premenopausal breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
