	<detailed_description>Screening period : Patients screen eligibility clinical study within 4-week period . Randomization leukapheresis period : When patient meet entry criterion , randomize ratio 1:1 one follow two group : Group A ( experimental group ) : Treatment DC addition chemotherapy 4-6 cycle pemetrexed/carboplatin first-line induction chemotherapy follow pemetrexed maintenance therapy . These patient undergo leukapheresis within 1 week randomization start treatment . Group B ( control group ) : Chemotherapy 4-6 cycle pemetrexed/carboplatin first-line induction chemotherapy follow pemetrexed maintenance therapy . Treatment period : Standard care chemotherapy administer patient treatment group cycle . Each chemotherapy cycle 3 week long . Patients group A start chemotherapy 2-5 day leukapheresis , patient group B start chemotherapy within 2 week randomization . Induction chemotherapy period Pemetrexed combination carboplatin administer Day 1 3-week chemotherapy cycle . After 2 cycle chemotherapy , tumor response evaluate accord RECIST v. 1.1 . Patients progressive disease intolerance chemotherapy terminate study treatment follow survival . Patients complete response , partial response , stable disease continue chemotherapy carboplatin pemetrexed total 6 cycle . After least total 4 cycle chemotherapy , patient administer pemetrexed maintenance chemotherapy . Maintenance chemotherapy period During Maintenance chemotherapy period , patient receive pemetrexed 3-week chemotherapy cycle . Chemotherapy pemetrexed administer total 21 cycle disease progression development intolerance . DCVAC Patients group A start DC treatment Day 15 chemotherapy Cycle 3 provided.During Induction chemotherapy period , DC administer Day 15 subsequent 3-week chemotherapy cycle chemotherapy . During Maintenance chemotherapy period , DC administer Day 15 every 3-week chemotherapy cycle . Follow-up period : Patients complete discontinue study treatment Cycle 3 disease progression undergo disease evaluation CT scan every 3 month progression disease.Patients discontinue study treatment Cycle 2 reason complete discontinue study treatment Cycle 3 disease progression follow survival . The survival data collect every 3 month directly contact patient ( relative/caretaker ) phone death reason termination study . The clinical study terminate least 45 PFS ( progression-free survival ) event reach , assume happen approximately 24 month start treatment first patient include study .</detailed_description>
