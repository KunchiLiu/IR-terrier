	<brief_summary>Background : Post-Infectious Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ( PI-ME/CFS ) refer long-lasting disable fatigue malaise , inability recover exercise , physical emotional discomfort may occur person infection . Researchers want learn cause . Objective : To learn PI-ME/CFS . Eligibility : Adults age 18-60 year finish least 7th grade education either : ME/CFS start infection OR Lyme disease , treat , return normal health OR healthy volunteer Design : Participants initially 2-5 day inpatient visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center Bethesda . During visit , participant : Medical history Physical exam Intravenous ( IV ) line . A thin plastic tube insert vein . Blood urine collect Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Participants lie machine take picture brain . They may get dye IV . Grip strength test Saliva , cheek swab , stool collect Tilt table test measure body function sweat breathing , blood pressure , heart rate blood urine sample collection Collection blood cell . Participants choose blood drawn IV machine filter blood cell return liquid blood back participant vein . Lumbar puncture . Fluid remove placement needle back bone . Heart monitor Sleep study participant PI ME/CFS Questions participant life feel Questions neuropsychologist Questions occupational therapist participant PI ME/CFS Questinos nutritionist After initial visit participant return home . Participants evaluate PI-ME/CFS first visit information review adjudication panel expert diagnosis care ME/CFS determine eligible participate second study visit . Eligible participant invite back second study visit . If participant take certain medication first visit , may ask taper prior second visit report problem . They also receive activity monitor , fatigue diary , nutrition log use least one week prior second visit . Participants eligible return 5-10 day inpatient hospital visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . During visit , participant undergo measurement 96 hour perform stationary bike exercise test . The purpose exercise test provoke ME/CFS symptom ( post-exertional malaise ) . Tests perform exercise testing . These include : Sleeping room measure body use energy EEG monitoring Eating control diet Performing vigorous exercise 10-15 minute Questions participant feel Questions participant usually eat Samples saliva , blood , urine stool Wearing activity monitor Having Xray measure body composition Thinking memory test Heart monitor Transcranial magnetic stimulation . A brief electrical current scalp create magnetic pulse affect brain activity . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Participants lie machine take picture brain . They think exercise task MRI . Lumbar puncture . Fluid remove placement needle back bone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary objective explore clinical biological phenotype post-infectious myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome ( PI-ME/CFS ) . The secondary objective explore pathophysiology fatigue post-exertional malaise ( PEM ) . Study population : Up 206 person enrol part protocol . Up 150 person age 18-60 part 3 study group : 50 ME/CFS patient whose fatigue begin infection , 50 non-fatigued participant document history Lyme disease exposure treatment , 50 healthy volunteer . The study target complete study procedure 20 enrol participant group . Up additional 36 person report community diagnosis ME/CFS enrol focus group discuss experience post-exertional malaise . Up additional 10 healthy volunteer 10 ME/CFS patient may enrol refine protocol 's electrophysiological neuroimaging technique . Design : This single-center , exploratory , cross-sectional study PI-ME/CFS . Participants phenotyping visit , encompass 2-5 day long inpatient admission NIH Clinical Center . Case status ME/CFS participant determine phenotyping visit case adjudication process utilize expert physician committee publish guideline . Adjudicated participant meet inclusion criterion invite back participate exercise stress visit , encompass 5-10 day long inpatient admission . Detailed subjective objective measurement biological specimen serially collect 96 hour peak exercise test capable induce post-exertional malaise visit . All procedure complete three study group allow optimal inter-group comparison . Outcome measure : 1 . Characterization immune system inflammatory signal blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) 2 . Characterization pattern microbiome gut , blood CSF 3 . Characterization physical cognitive fatigue use functional magnetic resonance image transcranial magnetic stimulation 4 . Effect maximal exertion neurocognition 5 . Effect maximal exertion brain function connectivity 6 . Effect maximal exertion marker immune dysfunction inflammation 7 . Effect maximal exertion metabolic function 8 . Effect maximal exertion autonomic function 9 . Effect maximal exertion gene expression profile blood CSF</detailed_description>

Additional inclusion criterion participant PIME/CFS phenotyping visit 1 . A selfreported illness narrative development persistent fatigue postexertional malaise consequence acute infection . The persistent fatigue may acute onset become progressively bad 6 month . 2 . Licensed Independent Practitioner documentation ME/CFS onset : Medical documentation absence symptom within one year ME/CFS onset . Documentation medical evaluation symptom acute infection documentation medical evaluation persistent symptom within 2 month follow assumed infection . 3 . Persistent fatigue PEM onset less 5 year prior enrollment . Additional inclusion criterion participant PIME/CFS exercise stress visit 1 . Be unanimously consider case PIME/CFS protocol adjudication committee . 2 . Meet 1994 Fukuda Criteria 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome . 3 . Have moderate severe clinical symptom severity : Severe fatigue determine use Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory ( MFI ) : score great equal 13 general fatigue subscale great equal 10 reduce activity subscale .
