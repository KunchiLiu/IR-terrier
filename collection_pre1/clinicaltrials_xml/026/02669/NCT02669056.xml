	<brief_summary>Although significant advance neonatal care increase survival rate preterm infant born 28 week gestation , concomitant decrease neuro developmental disorder achieve . Cerebral injury , well document previous year , preterm baby particularly deleterious since occur develop brain . They affect white grey matter complex mechanism principal target develop oligodendrocyte neuron subplate . All criterion define encephalopathy prematurity . Nevertheless , consequences prematurity level brainstem well know may explain neuro-developmental disorder normal MRI . The assessment motor repertoire complementary neurological examination may represent diagnostic tool cerebral palsy , mild motor deficit delay acquisition child . The newborn rich motor repertoire . GMs play key role development due feedback send cortical neuron reflect maturational stage Central Nervous System ( CNS ) . Lesions brainstem cause prematurity may induce alteration motor repertoire . Dysautonomic disorder , bradycardia , apneas , feed problem , occur frequently preterm baby reflect brainstem abnormality . These symptom also describe pathology , Rett syndrome sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) . In pathology deficit 5-HT system describe associated dysautonomia . It would interest evaluate 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) level preterm baby . The serotonergic system develop early gestation one first neurotransmitter appear develop brain . The main 5-HT nucleus locate within brainstem . 5-HT play important role homeostasis modulation respiratory network . Moreover , previous study show 5-HT projection spinal cord involve posture coordination . It tempt think 5-HT deficit may repercussions development CNS , change activity dependent process , spontaneous activity record spinal level rodent . In project , 5-HT platelet level preterm infant born 28 week compare newborn . correlation level 5-HT MRI posterior fossa , GMs dysautonomia different parameter heart rate variability , suction-swallowing different breathing technique establish</brief_summary>
