	<brief_summary>Background : At present pneumonia malnutrition become leading cause mortality among &lt; 5-year-old child develop country . World Health Organization standard management severe pneumonia severe malnutrition require hospitalization supportive care . As many develop country include Bangladesh enough pediatric hospital bed accommodate demand admission child severe pneumonia malnutrition , Investigators develop alternative treatment option `` Day Care Approach '' , child hospitalize , sick manage community . After successful Day Care Approach management efficacy trial severe childhood pneumonia severe malnutrition , next step conduct effectiveness trial `` real life '' condition , i.e . within Health Systems Bangladesh . Burden : Pneumonia lead cause mortality develop country , responsible 1,368,000 ( 18 % ) annual 7.6 million death , 95 % occur develop country . Similarly , malnutrition major health problem estimate 1.7 &amp; 3.6 million child die annually Severe Acute Malnutrition &amp; Moderate Acute Malnutrition , respectively . Objectives : To assess &amp; implement Day Care Approach management severe childhood pneumonia without Moderate Acute Malnutrition and/or severe underweight exist Health Systems Bangladesh safe &amp; cost effective alternative Existing Treatment . Methods : A cluster randomize control trial conduct Bangladesh involve 16 cluster ( Wards ) Dhaka &amp; 16 cluster ( Unions ) rural area randomly assign intervention &amp; control arm .

	<brief_title>Effectiveness Trial Day-care vs. Usual Care Severe Pneumonia &amp; Malnutrition Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Objectives : 1 . To assess whether Day care Approach management severe childhood pneumonia without moderate acute malnutrition and/or severe underweight incorporate exist urban rural Health Systems Bangladesh safe effective . 2 . To implement Day care Approach management severe childhood pneumonia without moderate acute malnutrition and/or underweight within Health Systems Bangladesh cost effective alternative Existing Treatment care Health Systems family . 3 . To examine compare cost effectiveness Day care Approach versus Existing Treatment care management severe childhood pneumonia without moderate acute malnutrition and/or severe underweight . 4 . To identify assess potential barrier challenge whole implementation process . Background Project include Preliminary Observations : At present depend clinical presentation , pneumonia classify severe pneumonia , pneumonia , pneumonia , accord recent guideline World Health Organization 2013 . Since pneumonia lead cause death &lt; 5-year-old child , intervention promote prevention treatment pneumonia essential part child survival effort achieve Millennium Development Goal 4 . World Health Organization standard management severe pneumonia require hospitalization supportive treatment include oxygen therapy hypoxaemia , airway suction , fluid nutritional management , antibiotic , careful monitoring . Most , , develop country include Bangladesh enough hospital , pediatric hospital bed accommodate demand admission child severe pneumonia without malnutrition co-morbidity . In addition , mother ill child childcare household responsibility constrain ability attend child hospitalization , often mandatory . Furthermore , transportation , cost , long distance hospital , lack adequate child-care home , cultural perception represent additional huge limitation hospitalization . Hospitalization also may feasible due inability parent stay hospital entire duration illness . The sum total common potential constraint lead failure hospitalization child severe pneumonia severe malnutrition without additional co-morbidity . This inadequate availability use hospital bed leading failure hospitalization child severe pneumonia and/or malnutrition assuredly result excess unwanted death child , , proper care , would otherwise survive . Although Investigators direct evidence ( data available ) bottleneck pneumonia death Bangladesh lack hospital bed mainly . But Investigators know experience many child severe pneumonia require hospitalization hospitalize due lack free pediatric bed , observed observational day care study . Study Design A cluster randomize control clinical trial conduct urban Dhaka rural Bangladesh . The trial area pre-selected basis infrastructure ( adequate space , water supply , electricity , willingness perform study ) . In urban area , 16 cluster equivalent Wards ( either whole partial ) , population 50,000 80,000 rural area , another 16 cluster equivalent Unions 20,000 30,000 inhabitant . Children severe pneumonia , accord recent World Health Organization criterion ( 2013 ) without malnutrition enrol study urban Dhaka : ( ) Tikatuli , Surjer Hashi Clinic , 12 , K.M . Das Lane ( ii ) Circular Road Circular Road Surjer Hashi Clinic , New Circular Road ; rural Bangladesh : ( iii ) Dhamrai Upazilla Dhaka District , ( iv ) Karimganj Upazilla Kishoreganj District one two management scheme : ( ) Existing Treatment control cluster , ( ii ) Day care Approach intervention cluster . Children history cough , fever difficult breathe suggestive severe pneumonia enrol primary health facility Primary Health Care Centres Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres urban area Health Family Welfare Centres Community Clinics rural area . Methods Primary study sit Urban : United States Agency International Development -Department For International Development support Non Government Organization Health Service Delivery Project Pathfinder run Population Services Training Center Concerned Women Family Development . The Ministry Health Family Welfare contribute urban health care outpatient service offer secondary , tertiary specialize hospital locate urban setting . Rural : Health service Bangladesh rural area mostly provide Government 's Ministry Health Family Welfare , Non-Government Organizations ( NGOs ) , private provider . In government sector , two community base worker - family welfare assistant health assistant - community clinic run community health care provider serve population 6000 7000 . Another first level outpatient clinic - e.g . Union Health Family Welfare Centres - serve population 20,000 . Randomization mask The trial field sit pre-selected basis infrastructure ( adequate space , water supply , electricity willingness perform study ) . Case Management Existing Treatment ( control ) cluster Children control Existing Treatment cluster pneumonia ( severe pneumonia ) with/without malnutrition identify Community Health Worker/Community Service Providers urban area Field Research Assistants/Field Assistants rural area , self-referred parents/caregivers Primary Health Care Centres ( Vital clinic ) /Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres ( Ultra clinic ) urban area Community Clinics/Health Family Welfare Centres rural area . Follow-up Existing Treatment control cluster Community Health Workers/Field Research Assistants/Field Assistants perform follow-up visit clinic day 2 , child 's home day 3 , clinic day 6 day 14 ( window period + 1 day ) Existing Treatment cluster four primary study site . In case treatment failure control area child refer hospital Day 2 . Day Care Approach ( Intervention ) cluster Similarly , child intervention Day care Approach cluster pneumonia ( severe pneumonia ) without malnutrition address manner control cluster , i.e . identify Community Health Workers urban area Field Research Assistants/Field Assistants rural area . As child control cluster 1st level care centre ( Primary Health Care Centres/Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres urban area Community Clinics/Health Family Welfare Centres rural area ) , child assess Physicians/Pediatricians work Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres urban area Sub Assistant Community Medical Officers work Health Family Welfare Centres rural area finally evaluate trained study physician treat home oral antibiotic ( syrup Amoxicillin 90 mg/kg three divide dose Co-trimoxazole 40 mg/kg two divided dos per day 5 day ) . Children pneumonia ( i.e. , severe pneumonia ) fail community level oral Amoxicillin/Co-trimoxazole treatment two day well present severe pneumonia ( self-referred identify Community Health Workers/Field Research Assistants/Field Assistants ) right begin assess Physicians/Pediatricians work Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres urban area Sub Assistant Community Medical Officers work Health Family Welfare Centres rural area finally evaluate trained study physician directly refer Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres urban area Health Family Welfare Centres rural area Day care Approach management . For purpose , child admit day-care section Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres urban area 08:30 17:00 hour day-care section Health Family Welfare Centres rural area 08:30 15:00 hour day week include weekend public holiday , fulfil criterion discharge ( clinical end-points , define hypoxemia , fever , fast breathe tachycardia ) . Parents bring child Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres/Health Family Welfare Centres 8:30 hour morning every day return back home 15:00 hour rural area 17:00 hour urban area . Follow-up study 3 month discharge After successful management enrol study child belong Existing Treatment/Day care Approach cluster discharge Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres/Health Family Welfare Centres . The study physicians inform parent date follow-up visit next 3 month write discharge certificate . Economic Evaluation Intervention Alternatives Effectiveness trial severe pneumonia without/with Moderate Acute Malnutrition severe underweight planned implement Day care Approach treatment urban Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres Dhaka city rural Health Family Welfare Centres Bangladesh . Cost intervention Intervention cost consist cost provider household . Cost provider Cost household Sample Size Calculation Outcome ( Primary Secondary ) Variable ( ) Cluster-randomized design dichotomous outcome equivalency design explicit expectation result primary outcome would fall within 95 % Confidence Intervals . Because number cluster fix 8 cluster per site per year include 4 control 4 intervention power 90 % , coefficient variation 0.20 , alpha 0.05 . On basis assumption , 50 child severe pneumonia without malnutrition without severe under-weight per cluster per year enrol 2.5 year , estimate 2000 patient study arm include 15 % drop-outs . 32 cluster need study arm . Therefore , period 2.5 year , total 4000 child easily recruit within time frame 4 primary study site . The estimated incidence pneumonia take 0.23 episode/ child/ year . Outcome Variables - The primary outcome variable follow ( ) Clinical treatment failure day 6 enrollment ( ii ) Success rate Health System Day acre Approach plus referral hospital verse Existing Treatment plus referral hospital ) - The secondary outcome variable : ( iii ) Treatment failure relapse day 7 day 14 child well day 6 ( iv ) Economic evaluation ( cost-effective analysis ) ( v ) Referrals hospital ( vi ) Deaths ( vii ) Compliance treatment ( viii ) Anthropometrical index body weight , length/height , Mid Upper Arm Circumference , Weight-for-Age ( % ) , Weight-for-Height ( % ) , Height-for-Age ( % ) ( ix ) Morbidity , mortality , relapse hospitalization 3-months follow-up discharge study ( x ) Family/patient satisfaction</detailed_description>
