	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE CIN Cervical dysplasia cause HPV common woman reproductive age . Cervical dysplasia know precancerous stage cervical cancer , cervical cancer fourth common cancer worldwide woman . Treatment moderate severe dysplasia often still surgical aim eliminate affected part transformation zone . There different type surgical treatment ( Large Loop excision transformation zone ( LLETZ ) , knife cone biopsy , laser conisation ) , around 90 % success rate . Historically moderate severe dysplasia treat cold knife biopsy . Nevertheless , deep cone hemorrhage , infection postprocedure stenosis report . LLETZ seem good alternative . It perform local anesthesia , cheap , less painful seem less short long term morbidity . In outcome LETTZ similar risk residual disease compare cold knife cone . LLETZ therefore golden standard treat cervical dysplasia nowadays . Still , uncertainty effect LLETZ short long term term recurrence , fertility future pregnancy outcome . Women diagnose CIN usually reproductive age , effect future fertility pregnancy concern . Women short time interval LLETZ pregnancy seem increase risk spontaneous abortion [ 6 ] . Also contradict evidence presume high risk preterm delivery low birth weight . One study report 10 fold high risk preterm delivery one conisation procedure woman cervical dysplasia . Furthermore , recent study show high subfertility rate patient underwent cervical surgery . Systematic review meta-analysis report LLETZ CIN also show increased rate preterm delivery ( &lt; 32wks RR 1.98 , 95 % CI 1.31-2.98 ; &lt; 28wks RR 2.33 , 95 % CI 1.84-2.94 ) , premature rupture membrane ( RR 1.88 , 95 % CI 1.54-2.29 ) low birth weight ( &lt; 2,500g RR 2.48 , 95 % CI 1.75-3.51 ) Apart reproductive argument ongoing debate longterm outcome treatment surgical excision . Several study show recurrence rate CIN 2-3 treatment 15-22 % within 2 year . Margin involvement seem risk factor develop residual recurrent cervical dysplasia Moreover , even adequate treatment follow normal smear result , patient treat cervical intraepithelial dysplasia seem excessive risk cervical cancer compare patient normal primary smear test result . This risk even almost 25 time high patient abnormal smear test result patient normal smear test result treatment . Recent study find woman residual recurrent disease test positive HPV treatment . Possibly could tool risk stratification follow treatment . Also , could raise question need treat HPV instead treat consequence HPV ( remove transformation zone ) . Especially patient recurrent residual disease . Evidence involvement Human Papilloma Virus CIN Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) cause pre-cancerous abnormality cervix . HPV 100 subtypes present 95 % pre-invasive invasive squamous carcinoma cervix . Some researcher state HPV negative cervical cancer exist . Certain serotypes associate high risk progression malignancy often find cervical cancer . This HPV type 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 45 , 52 , 58 . There evidence early detection high stage CIN lesion ( CIN 3 ) accomplish screen HPV DNA test cytology alone . Rationale Approximately 90 % HPV clear surgical treatment . Nonetheless , surgical treatment often deal consequence instead cause disease . There still significant amount woman develop residual recurrent disease . Recent publication show high risk invasive cancer treatment cervical neoplasia grade 3 comparison general population . Rebolj report incidence 35,1 per 100000 year 6,4 per 100000 year , respectively , lead adjust hazard ratio 4,2 period complete follow-up compare period normal primary smear test result . Strander et al , show overall standardised incidence ratio woman previous CIN grade 3 2,30 develop invasive cervical carcinoma compare general population . Over time , request non-invasive treatment treat HPV . Young girl vaccinate HPV 16 18 nowadays . The current analysis show efficacy almost 93 % CIN 2+associated HPV-16/18 evidence oncogenic HPV infection baseline . However 30 % efficacy see CIN2+ irrespective HPV type woman 70 % group evidence oncogenic HPV infection baseline . For CIN3+ number 33 % whole group 87 % HPV negative group . Vaccine efficacy CIN2+ associate 12 nonvaccine oncogenic type 54 % . Another problem vaccination uptake along young woman . Since reality still many woman could would get vaccinate , primary prevention HPV related disease still long way go . STUDY DESIGN This randomize , single blind , non-inferiority study female patient histologically recurrent/residual CIN reproductive age previous ablative treatment evaluate clinical immunological effect imiquimod . The estimate duration total study 24 month , total 433 patient include . Patients randomize one two study group : 1 . Treatment Imiquimod . Patients group treat Imiquimod 5 % total 16 week . 2 . LLETZ treatment ( standard treatment ) STUDY POPULATION Population Inclusion patient take place Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam , Meander hospital Amersfoort , Albert Schweitzer Hospital Dordrecht , Sint Franciscus hospital Rotterdam , Catharina hospital Eindhoven Maastricht University Medical Centre hospital Netherlands future . Patients draw colposcopy consultation . After qualify study participation base pre-study procedure , patient randomize receive either Imiquimod 5 % cream LLETZ ( standard treatment ) . Sample size calculation The regression rate second LLETZ procedure estimate 63 % retrospective cohort ( data publish ) . The regression rate CIN lesion treatment imiquimod base upon study report regression rate 16 week imiquimod therapy CIN . This study show regression rate 73 % patient primary CIN lesion . Since effect could lower patient residual persistent CIN , estimate regression rate 60 % . To calculate require sample size two-proportions non-inferiority trial assume probability regression 63 % standard ( LLETZ procedure ) 60 % treatment imiquimod . Using non-inferiority margin 10 % difference proportion significance level ( alpha ) 5 % , sample size 174 per group require obtain power least 80 % . Allowing 20 % loss follow-up total required sample size 433 . [ Chapter 4 : Sample size calculation clinical research ( 2nd edn ) . Shein-Chung Chow , Jun Shao Hansheng Wang , Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC , Boca Raton , FL , 2008 ] Because uncertainty assumption interim analysis futility perform DMC soon primary outcome available 35 patient . This interim analysis base predictive power . That predict probability able prove non-inferiority give result interim analysis . When predictive power point 20 % trial stop due futility . Of course DMC always stop trial due safety concern . The trial never stop prematurely efficacy alpha-adjustment make . Description justification route administration dosage Imiquimod 5 % cream administer vaginal applicator , contain 12,5 mg Imiquimod ( one sachet ) . The cream administrate three time per week go bed patient . In case uncomfortable reaction application reduce twice one per week side effect persist . When local side effect persist medication discontinue one week . The following treatment protocol apply : - Treatment period 16 week , 3 dos 1 sachet ( 12,5 mg Imiquimod ) apply three time per week .

Every visit , questionnaire fill evaluate symptom adverse event . Side effect adverse event document accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events guideline checkup . Patients also instruct report adverse event immediately visit hospital necessary . Diary card completion dose procedure review treatment visit . Clinically significant abnormality associate adverse event follow . Because unknown possible effect imiquimod treatment , necessary exclude pregnancy enrolment study . Moreover , contraception advise treatment period unknown effect Imiquimod pregnancy . Many CIN-patients also diagnose VIN VAIN lesion , colposcopy also vagina vulva inspected necessary , take biopsy . At 26 week ( ten week treatment period ) biopsy take area cervical lesion judge abnormal HPV DNA assay conduct . Also cytology take . If classification CIN increase stabilise , LLETZ perform . Patients PAP 3B cytology colposcopic suspicion CIN1 le also treat LLETZ rule invasive disease another location biopsy take . Patients regression CIN classification lesion ( cytology PAP3A le ) treat conservative followed schedule patient LLETZ . At 6 18 month finish treatment cytology take follow-up . When cytology abnormal colposcopy perform . When recurrence CIN 2 3 invasive disease suspect another biopsy take . Further treatment accord expertise treating physician . To evaluate quality life follow questionnaire use . 1 . Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey ( RAND 36 ) , access generic health-related quality life . 2 . European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) quality-of-life questionnaire : QLQ-C30 , assess cancer-specific health-related quality life . 3 . European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) quality-of-life questionnaire : QLQ-CX24 , assess cervical specific quality life , include sexual functioning . Patient withdrawal discontinuation Following treatment initiation , patient 's trial participation end one follow occurs : - Patient complete study procedure include 16 week treatment , follow-up visit 26 week , 12 24 month . - Patient discontinues study participation prior completion study procedure .
