	<brief_summary>Background : Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) complication people experience hematopoietic stem cell transplant . It usually affect people chronic graft versus host disease ( cGVHD ) . This occur donor stem cell attack cell person receive . BOS reduce airflow oxygen level body . It may cause neutrophil elastase body . Researchers believe new drug AZD9668 may help . Objectives : To test safety AZD9668 see dose best inhibits neutrophil elastase people BOS stem cell transplant . To study well best dose improves lung function people . Eligibility : Adults 18 old hematopoietic stem cell transplant cGVHD BOS . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They lung function heart function test . They compute tomography scan chest . Study part 1 : Participants take start dose study drug mouth twice day 14 day . This 1 cycle . They get different dos , 4 cycle . Study part 2 : Participants take study drug twice day mouth dose set part 1 , 12 month . Participants keep medicine diary . Participants several study visit . These may include : Repeats screen test . Bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage . Sputum sample take . 6-minute walking test . cGVHD assessment answer question . Participants contact study 24 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD ) lead cause non-relapse morbidity mortality person allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . - Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) complication cGVHD associate high morbidity mortality , treatment option limit . - Neutrophil elastase ( NE ) protease release neutrophil set inflammation , implicate pathogenesis BOS . - AZD9668 potent selective inhibitor NE demonstrate evidence target inhibition good safety profile patient inflammatory lung disease , evaluate BOS . Objectives : Phase 1b : To determine optimal biologic dose ( OBD ) base maximal NE inhibition measure blood , determine safety AZD9668 patient BOS SCT Phase 2 : To determine clinical efficacy AZD9668 OBD patient BOS SCT , base proportion patient stable improve forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) pulmonary function test Eligibility : Inclusion criterion : - Age great equal 18 year - BOS SCT moderate severe cGVHD define NIH consensus criterion - Within 2 year time diagnosis ( Phase 2 ) - Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % - If systemic cGVHD therapy , must receive stable tapering dos precede 4 week - Patients require received prior treatment azithromycin least 3 month prior enrollment , unless evidence progression unsatisfactory response azithromycin prior 3 month treatment , deem treat refer physician . - Patients azithromycin , antibiotic use treatment BOS , need discontinue least 2 week prior enrollment Exclusion criterion : - FEV1 &lt; 30 % ( base absolute percent predict use USA-ITS-NIH equation ) pulmonary function test - Prior use neutrophil elastase inhibitor - Progressive malignancy - Uncontrolled infection major organ dysfunction define protocol Design : Phase 1b : - This Phase 1b trial determine OBD safety AZD9668 patient BOS SCT . - This trial use intra-patient dose escalation schedule . The start dose 60mg twice daily 2 week , dose increase 60mg escalation every 2 week maximum dose 240mg twice daily reach total treatment period 8 week . After completion dose escalation phase , patient option continue dose maximal NE inhibition safety demonstrate 6 additional month . - The co-primary endpoint OBD define dose level maximal NE inhibition occur , 1/3 patient experience DLT . NE activity measure blood baseline dose escalation , compare dose level determine OBD . - The co-primary endpoint safety determine monitoring adverse event dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) define protocol . Further dose escalation cease patient experience DLT . In addition , subsequent patient treat beyond dose 1/3 patient experienced DLT . - A total 10 patient enrol Phase 1b trial . Phase 2 : - This Phase 2 trial determine efficacy AZD9668 OBD patient BOS SCT , measure stabilization improvement FEV1 ( base absolute percent predict ) 6 month treatment . - Patients receive AZD9668 OBD determine Phase 1b trial , pulmonary function test measurement FEV1 perform determine primary endpoint . - Response assessment occur every 3 month primary efficacy endpoint evaluate 6 month . Patients stable respond disease option continue therapy another 6 month . - As early stopping rule futility , 0-2 first 8 patient enrol responded , patient accrue . While to10 patient may require Phase 1b portion trial 20 patient may need evaluation phase II , order allow small number inevaluable patient , accrual ceiling set 34 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation moderate severe chronic GVHD define NIH consensus criterion . Patients must BOS define NIH consensus criterion ( 2014 update criterion ) . To meet criterion BOS , follow must present , addition least one distinctive manifestation cGVHD : FEV1/vital capacity &lt; 0.7 fifth percentile predict FEV1 &lt; 75 % predict great equal 10 % decline le 2 year . FEV1 correct &gt; 75 % albuterol , absolute decline correct value still remain great equal 10 % 2 year Absence infection respiratory tract One 2 support feature BOS : 1 . Evidence air trap expiratory CT small airway thicken bronchiectasis highresolution CT , 2 . Evidence air trap PFTs : residual volume &gt; 120 % predict residual volume/total lung capacity elevate outside 90 % confidence interval . If patient carry diagnosis cGVHD virtue organ involvement elsewhere , first 3 criterion necessary . For Phase 1b study , patient may diagnosis BOS period time . For Phase 2 study , patient must within 2 year time diagnosis . Patients may time interval SCT long criterion chronic GVHD BOS meet . If patient take systemic therapy cGVHD time enrollment , must receive stable tapering dos within previous 4 week . Patients require completed course steroid prior enrollment . Age great equal to18 year . Karnofsky great equal 60 % Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte great equal 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,000/mcL platelet great equal 50,000/mcL total bilirubin less equal 3 X institutional upper limit normal , unless know history Gilbert disease AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) ( CockroftGault formula ) Patients require receive prior treatment azithromycin least 3 month prior enrollment , unless evidence progression unsatisfactory response azithromycin prior 3 month treatment , deem treat refer physician . Patients azithromycin need discontinue least 2 week prior enrollment Agree adhere method contraception fertility control measure : The effect AZD9668 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study therapy . Contraception use 1 week discontinue study medication . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , man partner become pregnant suspect pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : FEV1 &lt; 30 % ( base absolute percent predict use USAITSNIH equation ) pulmonary function test Patients clinically relevant abnormal ECG finding , include abnormal QTc &gt; 500 m screen ECG ( Note : If patient QTc interval &gt; 500 m screen ECG , screen ECG may repeat twice [ least 24 hour apart ] total 3 ECGs ) . Patients receive investigational agent Recurrent progressive malignancy require anticancer treatment Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , acute kidney injury , psychiatric illness/social situation within previous 4 week would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study teratogenic effect AZD9668 unknown . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother AZD9668 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated agent . Prior use neutrophil elastase inhibitor</criteria>
