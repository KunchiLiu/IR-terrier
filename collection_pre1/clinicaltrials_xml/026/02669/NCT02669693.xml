	<brief_summary>This research aim determine whether presence oleuropein olives ( Olea europaea L. ) lower effect post-prandial blood glucose level . Volunteers require consume commercially available olive together white bread , glycaemic response measure . The blood glucose response bread determine initially control/reference . Food sample control consume random order . The recent rise case Diabetes mellitus child adult raise concern need proffer immediate solution amongst scientist field medicine food science nutrition . One approach reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia high glucose spike impede digestion absorption starch . This potentially achieve inhibition activity starch digest enzyme namely alpha amylase alpha glycosidase . There currently antidiabetic drug acarbose miglitol quite efficient inhibitory function without associated side effect complication liver toxicity , etc , arise long term usage drug . It therefore become imperative natural substitute food source explore good alternative . At moment several plant food investigation suitable alternative , olive appear quite promising regard . There quite study report inhibitory activity olives oleuropein alpha amylase vitro information vivo test scarce . It expect research outcome gateway reduction control incidence diabetes mellitus .</brief_summary>

Blood glucose measure consumption test meal/control use commercially available glucometer available bought member public people already use . It measure glucose concentration immediately meet accuracy requirement ISO 15197 standard . A drop blood enough obtain participant mean mild finger prick use sterile puncture device design purpose time point . The finger prick protocol WHO/FAO 1998 glycaemic index approve protocol . Nine ( 9 ) finger prick need ( 0 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 180minutes ) need per study session .</detailed_description>
