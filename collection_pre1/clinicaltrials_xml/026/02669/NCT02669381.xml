	<brief_summary>Phenylalanine essential amino acid people need obtain diet . Amino acid building block protein , required form tissue body . It well know pregnant woman require protein diet , exact amount amino acid undetermined . To find much phenylalanine pregnant woman require , investigator plan study pregnant woman early late gestation modern minimally invasive technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenylalanine Requirements Healthy Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator 's purpose determine phenylalanine requirement healthy pregnant woman part Master 's Thesis project . The determined requirement take account give dietary recommendation , ensure healthy pregnancy . The hypothesis current recommendation phenylalanine intake give pregnant woman underestimate . The investigator also hypothesize phenylalanine requirement early stage pregnancy low requirement towards later stage pregnancy . Current dietary intake recommendation phenylalanine base factorial ( mathematical ) calculation account requirement difference early late pregnancy . Static recommendation throughout stage pregnancy appropriate multitude adaptation human body go gestation . Whether phenylalanine requirement differ different stage gestation unknown . In addition , phenylalanine precursor tyrosine , conditionally indispensable amino acid . Together refer aromatic amino acid . The DRI give recommendation total aromatic amino acid ( TAA , phenylalanine + tyrosine ) 36 mg/kg/d pregnancy . Since study first interested phenylalanine requirement pregnancy , investigator determine phenylalanine requirement presence excess tyrosine ( 61 mg/kg/d ) pregnancy , similar early study . The investigator recruit healthy pregnant woman age 20 40 13th-19th week gestation 33rd 39th week gestation . Once get contact lab , initial visit ( pre-study ) take place . Here , participant measure eligibility take consent form . They participate pre-study stage pregnancy , wish participate stage . If meet criterion agree participate , return two study day per stage 8 hour . Therefore , recruit late pregnancy able participate two study day total . During study day feed protein shake contain stable isotope , oxidation isotope measure determine breakpoint ( requirement ) phenylalanine . Breath sample , urine sample , small blood sample take study day .</detailed_description>
