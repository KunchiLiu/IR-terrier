	<detailed_description>Any adult patient age18 , schedule routine CTA chest chest , abdomen pelvis meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion include study . The patient administer low dose intravenous contrast base study examination describe . CTA chest : 40 mL intravenous contrast rate 5mL/sec . A region interest ( ROI ) trigger scan place aortic arch . If scan perform use high pitch helical mode , scan delay increase 2 second . CTA chest abdomen CTA chest , abdomen pelvis : 50 mL intravenous contrast rate 5mL/sec . A region interest ( ROI ) trigger scan place aortic arch . If scan perform use high pitch helical mode , scan delay increase 2 second . Following examination , primary investigator ( PI ) team member evaluate image obtain low contrast dose patient 's prior CTA examination perform routine contrast dose . This do quantitative qualitative measure . For quantitative portion , PI team member place region interest predetermine arterial location obtain measure degree opacification . For qualitative measurement , image present blind fashion two thoracic train board certify radiologist board certify interventional radiologist determine quality image base Likert numerical scale . Qualitative quantitative data image obtain low contrast dose prior CTA examination perform routine contrast dose compare . This data along detail scan protocol ( dose , dose rate , scan parameter etc . ) demographic data ( sex , age BMI time examination ) record .</detailed_description>
