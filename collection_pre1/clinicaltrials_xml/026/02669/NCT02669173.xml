	<brief_summary>This study involve participant recurrent glioblastoma brain tumor ( GBM ) . This mean participant 's brain tumor either return treat previous therapy , continue progress despite treat . The purpose study provide proof concept suppression MDSCs ( myeloid-derived suppressor cell ) feasible patient GBM . Rather target tumor cell immune checkpoint , focus recent therapeutic effort , direct target MDSCs low dose capecitabine potential reverse immunosuppressed microenvironment GBM thereby reduce tumor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine + Bevacizumab Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To achieve 20-fold MDSC reduction concentration circulate MDSCs treatment low dose capecitabine . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine concentration circulate MDSCs patient recurrent glioblastoma treatment low dose capecitabine 2 . To determine concentration tissue MDSCs T-regulatory cell resect glioblastoma treatment low dose capecitabine 3 . To determine safety toxicity continuous low dose capecitabine without standard dose bevacizumab . Exploratory Objective : To obtain signal efficacy measure progression-free survival rate 6 month</detailed_description>

Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 21 day study entry . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 30 day last dose study drug . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 30 day last dose study drug . Patients must able swallow whole tablet . Systolic blood pressure ≤ 160 mg Hg diastolic pressure ≤ 90 mg Hg within 14 day prior study registration Electrocardiogram without evidence acute cardiac ischemia within 14 day prior study registration Patients must follow minimum interval prior treatment : surgery 4 week nitrosoureas 6 week cytotoxic chemotherapy standard interval depend recent regimen . i.e. , temozolomide 5 28 , 23 day recent temozolomide ; temozolomide 21 28 day , 7 day recent dose ; etoposide 14 21 day , 7 day last dose . For drug list , research nurse , treat investigator , principal investigator determine appropriate interval . Investigational therapy non cytotoxic therapy 2 week Prior treatment toxicity resolve ≤ Grade 1 accord NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 except alopecia neuropathy . Subjects receive investigational agent .
