	<brief_summary>Brain metastasis common intracranial malignancy occur 20-40 % cancer , presence CNS metastases associate poor prognosis . As , median overall survival patient symptomatic brain lesion dismal 2-3 month regardless tumor type . Because standard chemotherapy largely cross blood brain barrier meaningful concentration , standard treatment limit usually involve surgical resection and/or stereotactic radiosurgery isolate lesion whole brain radiation multiple lesion . Unfortunately , median overall survival improve 6 month multimodality approach2 , paucity second-line therapy treat recurrence . Furthermore , re-resection re-radiation often feasible option due concern increase complication neurotoxicity , respectively . Thus , dire clinical need additional treatment option patient population . Checkpoint blockade therapy , particular PD-1 PD-L1 inhibition , recently show clinical efficacy multiple type solid tumor . The investigator propose study efficacy checkpoint blockade therapy patient solid tumor refractory/recurrent brain metastasis . The investigator assess efficacy MEDI4736 , novel PD-L1 inhibitory monoclonal antibody , study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cohort A : Histologically confirm metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer ( histologic subtypes allow ) radiographic evidence MRI least one measurable brain lesion define RANO criterion require corticosteroid symptomatic control . Cohort B : Histologically confirm metastatic solid tumor epithelial origin , exclude NSCLC , include limited ovarian cancer , colorectal cancer , pancreatic cancer , gastric cancer , renal cancer , bladder cancer , breast cancer radiographic evidence MRI least one measurable brain lesion define RANO criterion require corticosteroid symptomatic control . Cohort C : Histologically confirm metastatic solid tumor epithelial origin , include NSCLC nonNSCLC , radiographic evidence MRI least one measurable brain lesion define RANO criterion require corticosteroid symptomatic control . At least one prior treatment CNSbased lesion require . Prior therapy must complete &gt; 2 week prior enrollment . A previously treat lesion must demonstrate MRI progress follow treatment order eligible . The subsequent development new CNS lesion previously treat permit dose require treatment follow progression prior enrollment . Treatment single CNS lesion local therapy context multifocal disease permit long least one untreated lesion meet criteria measurable disease . Patients receive minimum one line systemic therapy .
