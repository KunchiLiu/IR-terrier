	<brief_title>Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) Treat Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acute chronic liver failure ( ACLF ) characterise severe deterioration liver function due precipitate event top underlying chronic liver disease . As therapeutic option limited mortality rate lie 40 80 % 3 month . The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) mobilize stem- well immune cell improve liver function preclinical trial . G-CSF treatment reduce rate infectious complication significantly improve patients´ survival acute chronic liver failure , show recently small randomised study . Thus , G-CSF promising treatment option need evaluate multi-centre control trial . The GRAFT trial randomise patient ACLF standard care without G-CSF . All participant follow 12 month order evaluate safety efficacy G-CSF . If successful , GRAFT trial potential change clinical practice acute chronic liver failure .</detailed_description>
