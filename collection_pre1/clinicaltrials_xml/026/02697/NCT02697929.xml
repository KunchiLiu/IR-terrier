	<brief_summary>Cirrhotic patient undergo liver transplantation high risk post operative complication post-operative residual curarization . Rocuronium neuromuscular block agent nowadays safely rapidly antagonized sugammadex . No one study compare sugammadex versus neostigmine rocuronium infusion liver transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It know major abdominal surgery associate increase risk morbidity postoperative mortality . The complexity duration procedure well failure antagonize neuromuscular block agent end surgical procedure risk factor postoperative complication . Muscle relaxation play important role facilitate intubation allow good surgical condition . For reason necessary maintain , surgery , deep neuromuscular block . Deep block level adductor muscle thumb obtain measure 1-2 response post-tetanic stimulation ( so-called Post-Tetanic Count PTC ) . The maintenance deep neuromuscular block require dose neuromuscular blocker , therefore , need long recovery time regardless drug use . Pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics neuromuscular block reversal commonly use clinical practice undergo significant change due presence alteration organ function hepatic renal insufficiency . In patient see frequent adverse event prolong neuromuscular blockade postoperative residual curarization . In literature consider suitable recovery neuromuscular block relationship fourth first contraction Train Four ( TOF ) great 0.9 ( TOF-ratio &gt; 0.9 ) . This may take long time reversal block agent end surgical procedure solution reduce wait period . The importance adequate recovery neuromuscular block end anesthesia relate avoid postoperative residual paralysis ( PORC ) reduce risk postoperative respiratory complication potentially fatal . Rocuronium characterized increase half-life increase recovery time neuromuscular transmission ( TOF ratio 0.9 ) cirrhotic patient compare control healthy people . To prevent residual neuromuscular blockade complication brings could resort use anti-cholinesterase drug ( neostigmine ) antagonize indirectly action non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent . Neostigmine work increase availability acetylcholine neuromuscular junction . The administration neostigmine may however cause bronchospasm , abdominal pain , nausea , cardiac arrhythmia use neuromuscular blockade deep . Recently use sugammadex , new drug act antidote comparison non-depolarizing muscle relaxant amino-steroidal ( rocuronium , vecuronium ) show good clinical impact . This drug work encapsulate muscle relaxant molecule plasma high affinity bind complex thus form eliminate kidney . Sugammadex characterize absence adverse effect recommend dos may administer correct dosage , even deep neuromuscular blockade . Several study show recovery neuromuscular blockade induce rocuronium significantly faster administration sugammadex compare neostigmine use moderate block level deep . In literature data study assess recovery time neuromuscular transmission ( TOF ratio &gt; 0.9 ) use sugammadex verus neostigmine patient undergo liver transplantation rocuronium infusion .</detailed_description>
