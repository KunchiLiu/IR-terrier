	<brief_title>Treatment Osteoarthritis With Stromal Vascular Fraction Abdominal Adipose Tissue - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee destructive joint disease , cause degeneration cartilage , damage underlie bone morphological change joint1 . It major public health concern due increase life expectancy age population2,3 . No approved medical treatment reverse morphological change currently exist . Conventional treatment include physiotherapy , pain killer , brace end-stage OA surgical knee replacement4 . Treatment Osteoarthritis Paqe 3 Version 2 Stromal Vascular Fraction Adipose tissue 02-11-2015 During past decade researcher start explore regenerative potential mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) OA5 . MSCs multipotent progenitor cell able give rise osteocyte , adipocytes , chondrocytes , myoblasts tenocytes6 . MSCs first use treat Chondral defect 19987 treat OA 20028 . Since , number case report prospective series publish show significant short term long term effect pain cartilage thickness5 . Recently prospective case-series 1128 patient involve 1856 joint treat stromal vascular fraction abdominal Adipose tissue ( SVF ) rich source mesenchymal stem cell . 86 % treated patient show improvement least 50 % modify Knee/Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS/HOOS ) 3 month 129 . Only 0.9 % patient non-responders show improvement treatment . No serious adverse effect like infection tumor formation observed9 , accordance previous studies10 . Non-manipulated minimally manipulate cell therapy use within wide range medical condition include : stroke , myocardial infarction , Crohn 's disease , rheumatoid arthritis breast augmentation . More 17,000 scientific article publish report treatment 320,000 patients11 . No severe safety issue raised12 . Mesenchymal stem cell derive bone marrow adipose tissue5 . Most research perform bone marrow-derived stem cell past year series study publish show promising effect Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( AMSCs ) . By use AMSC large amount cell harvest small volume tissue thereby avoid costly time consume process expand cell culture5,9 . Abdominal adipose tissue show 1000 time high concentration AMSC investigate adipose tissue9 . This open possibility one-step procedure cell harvest injected one visit outpatient clinic . The optimal dose AMSC unknown effect seem dose-dependent dos around 1.0 x 108 AMSCs per injection desirable5,9 . The stromal vascular fraction abdominal Adipose tissue rich source adipose derive mesenchymal stem cell . In 2014 Lipogems system launch commercial of-the-shelf product : http : //lipogems.eu/ . The Lipogems system enzyme-free technology develop process lipoaspirates close system , result non-expanded adipose tissue product contain SVF13 . Before use product large scale control study feasibility safety need . Study Objective To investigate feasibility short term safety issue treatment knee osteoarthritis intra-articular injection stromal vascular fraction abdominal adipose tissue ( SVF ) harvest prepared use Lipogems System . Hereby wish pave road high quality randomize control trial investigate effectiveness treatment knee osteoarthritis SVF look patient report outcome , function , homeostasis joint cartilage regeneration . 6 Treatment Patients participate study treat accord Danish National Clinical Guidelines people osteoarthritis16 . They receive three month physiotherapy , guide concern optimal pharmaceutical treatment painkiller people BMI 28 offer consultation dietitian . 6.1 Description active treatment The active treatment intra-articular injection stromal vascular fraction ( SVF ) harvest patient 's abdominal subcutaneous fatty tissue . SVF harvest use Lipogems system . 6.1.1 Harvest SVF Harvest SVF do sterile condition outpatient clinic . The patient position supine examination bench . The area tissue harvest marked skin surgical marker . The area app . 8cm ( cranio-caudal ) x 20cm ( lateral ) situate umbilicus . Local anesthesia apply whole area suspension Carbocain 1 % , 200ml isotonic saline , adrenaline 10mmol Bicarbonate . Surgical cleaning perform twice sterile drape apply . Through stab incision harvest needle introduce subcutaneous fat suction apply . 20ml 40ml subcutaneous adipose tissue harvest . At end procedure skin close plaster . 6.1.2 Preparation SVF implantation The syrinx subcutaneous aspirate prepare use Lipogems system . The Lipogems system enzyme-free technology develop process variable amount lipoaspirates closed system , result nonexpanded adipose tissue product contain SVF . The technology work mild mechanical tissue cluster size reduction . Thereby avoid use enzyme additional processing ( i.e. , centrifugation subfractional harvesting ) .13 6.1.3 Implantation SVF Implantation SVF do sterile condition outpatient clinic . The patient position supine examination bench affect knee stretch . The superior pole patella palpate femoral condyle mark surgical marker . The suprapattelar recess locate ultrasound , local anesthesia apply injection site surgical cleaning perform twice . Injection SVF suprapattelar recess do use 21 gauge syringe direct visualization ultrasound . At end procedure skin close plaster . 6.1.4 Control dose inject SVF Control dose AMSC inject SVF perform injection . As consequence logistical favorable setup harvest implantation perform one-step procedure possible count AMSC injection . Instead one mL solution send cell count pathological department .</detailed_description>
