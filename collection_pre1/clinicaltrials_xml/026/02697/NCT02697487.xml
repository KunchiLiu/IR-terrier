	<detailed_description>This longitudinal observational study design utilize health IT advance collect information patient undergo routine care . This information collect part routine care store database research purpose . Patients undergo routine care provider invite participate UTSW Depression Cohort . After obtain informed consent , CDRCC team collect information source outline background section protocol store secure UT Southwestern network database protect security firewall . A schematic representation information process show page 7 protocol . The CDRCC team also collect specimen obtain part standard care beyond amount need routine clinical care . For research-only purpose , CDRCC team also collect blood , saliva , stool urine specimen regular interval describe subsequent section consent study participant . Clinics health care facility collaborate CDRCC approach patient participate cohort . Research staff UTSW staff clinic ( health care facility ) receive train obtain informed consent ask interested patient sign IRB-approved Informed Consent HIPAA authorization document . Initially , Informed Consent HIPAA authorization document paper , document scan stored master log Cohort database addition securely store paper copy . In future , patient ask complete Informed Consent HIPAA authorization document use computer handheld electronic device ( include signature ) . Paper document make available prefer request . Staff CDRCC available either person , email , phone answer question arise informed consent process answer clinic staff . If patient age 18 , provide assent , parent LAR provide consent . The CDRCC also develop material print electronic format publicize UTSW Depression Cohort . Other patient healthy individual involve CDRCC collaborator also join registry complete informed consent process . The UTSW Depression Cohort include comprehensive information collect part routine care patient 's provider ( ) . During routine care medical provider ' office , patient may fill screen questionnaire self-rated behavioral health assessment , provide medical psychiatric history , undergo laboratory test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , radiologic clinically relevant investigation give treatment recommendation . Some self-rated assessment complete part measurement base care may include Patient Health Questionnaire 2 ( PHQ-2 ) , Patient Health Questionnaire 9 ( PHQ-9 ) , Patient Adherence Questionnaire ( PAQ ) , Frequency , Intensity , Burden Side Effects Rating ( FIBSER ) , Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 ( GAD-7 ) , Concise Associated Symptoms Tracking - Self-Report Scale ( CAST-SR ) , Pain Frequency , Intensity , Burden Scale ( P-FIBS ) , Concise Health Risk Tracking Scale ( CHRT ) , Alcohol Drug usage screen . The information Cohort database store indefinitely unless participant request principal investigator remove his/her name associate information . Research assessment As part UTSW Depression Cohort , participant undergo diagnostic assessment use MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview , Version 7.0 DSM-5 ( MINI ) complete self-report research assessment psychiatric symptom psychosocial functioning . These research assessment add 60-90 minute visit duration . Specimen bank : As part UTSW Depression Cohort , patient allow banking specimen . The study enroll participant comfortable provide specimen . Of course , like study procedure , comfortable provide specimen enrol study . Specimens bank may include blood blood product , urine , stool sample , tissue sample , saliva clinical waste product . Clinical waste product include surgical waste tissue sample , placenta sample biopsy sample . Once sample collect , identify information remove , give unique code . The information link unique code patient 's identifying information store master log . Samples store appropriately CDRCC freezer locate north campus building UT Southwestern . Samples overseen CDRCC research personnel . A sample store indefinitely sample run destroy . Blood blood products- Blood obtain venipuncture perform personnel phlebotomy training .
