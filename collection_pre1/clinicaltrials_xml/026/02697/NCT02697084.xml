However , incidence increase considerably past three decade . The main risk factor HPV infection smoke . Initial treatment comprises radiochemotherapy radiotherapy alone , accord patient 's tumor stage tolerance chemotherapy . The choice appropriate treatment strategy condition patient 's prognosis . Consequently , early assessment initial extension tumor , therapeutic response relapse constitute determine factor management disease Despite good result obtain , persistent disease observe 30 % case abdominal-pelvic salvage amputation prove effective case local loco-regional relapse .
