	<brief_summary>This 12-week prospective , randomize , double-blind , two-center trial evaluate impact microcrystalline zinc-hydroxyapatite ( mHA ) dentifrice plaque formation rate ( PFR ) periodontitis patient . The investigator hypothesize mHA precipitate cause delay plaque development compare fluoridate control ( AmF/SnF2 ) , therefore would improve periodontal health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Purpose The purpose study assess clinical efficacy new dentifrice , contain carbonate/hydroxyapatite nanocrystals ( BioRepair® , Kurt Wolff , Bielefeld , Germany ) , subject suffer severe gingivitis and/or mild moderate chronic periodontitis receive non-surgical periodontal therapy . Clinical efficacy evaluate regard clinical microbiological parameter compare use zinc-fluoride containing dentifrice ( Meridol® , GABA , Lörrach , Germany ) serve positive control . Research Questions This three-month clinical trial conduct answer follow research question : Primary Question 1 . Is difference de novo plaque formation measure Plaque Formation Rate Index ( Axelsson 1991 ) subject use new carbonate/hydroxylapatite nanocrystal dentifrice use establish zinc-fluoride contain control dentifrice ? Secondary Questions 2 . Are differences subject use two dentifrice respect subjective perception therapy ? 3 . Are differences two dentifrice respect follow periodontal measurement : change full mouth plaque score ( O'Leary Plaque Control Record , O'Leary 1972 ) , gingival index ( Löe 1967 ) , change pocket probe depth ( PPD 's ) , percentage site attachment gain ≥ 2 mm ? 4 . Are qualitative quantitative change regard composition oral microflora ? Study design The investigation design double blind , parallel group , randomize trial 3-months period ( primary endpoint ) . Secondary endpoint schedule . Seventy-five subject enrol four-visit study ; visit 1-4 required subject . Test control group subject treat follow identical therapy protocol , except dentifrice . Participating study center Department Periodontology University Münster Department Periodontology University Würzburg . Subject Registration Randomization Subjects fulfil inclusion criterion , meet exclusion criterion , sign informed consent register study center Münster Würzburg ( visit 1 ) . At visit 2 study subject randomly assign test group use carbonate/hydroxyapatite nanocrystal dentifrice control group use zinc-fluoride containing dentifrice . Patient randomization warrant use randomization list ( block randomization 4 subject per block ) . Designation study subject smoker/non-smoker base record carbonmonoxide concentration exhale air ( non-smoker : le 3 ppm CO exhale air ; smoker : equal 3 ppm ) . Treatment subject At visit 1 ( `` Screening/Recruitment '' ) subject inform projected trial . If subject willing participate , receive periodontal screening examination ( PSI ) medical history ask . At visit 2 ( `` Baseline '' , consist two appointment interval 24 hour ) within first appointment , subject randomize periodontal parameter examine . The blinded package different dentifrice dispense subject . At end , subject receive routine supragingival scale sonic scaler polish air powder device ( glycin powder ) . Subjects instruct abstain oral hygiene next 24 hour . At end , subject fill two questionnaire . At second appointment , plaque formation rate examine subject instructed brush already use toothbrush 2 minute least twice per day home . Four week `` Baseline '' visit 3 ( `` Treatment '' , consist two appointment interval 24 hour ) , periodontal parameter examine subject receive full mouth supra- subgingival debridement two session two consecutive day . Debridement perform sonic scaler use micro tip local anesthesia polish perform air powder device . Subjects instruct abstain oral hygiene next 24 hour . At second appointment , plaque formation rate examine , subject receive full mouth supra- subgingival debridement , instructed brush already use toothbrush 2 minute least twice per day home . Two month `` Treatment '' visit 4 ( `` Reevaluation '' , consist two appointment interval 24 hour ) periodontal parameter examine subject receive full mouth supragingival debridement one session . Subjects instruct abstain oral hygiene next 24 hour . At second appointment , plaque formation rate examine , subject receive full mouth supragingival debridement . Subjects return dentifrice package . Over course study medication except dentifrice local anesthesia administer . During trial , subject permit undergo advanced periodontal treatment ( i.e . periodontal surgery ) receive drug influence periodontal health . Clinical Examinations After assess plaque gingival index ( O'Leary 1972 , Löe 1967 ) clinical measurement full mouth pocket probe depth ( PPD ) , bleed probe ( BOP ) , gingival recession ( GR ) , furcation involvement take . All measurement , except furcation involvement , take six site per tooth ( mesiobuccal , mid-buccal , distobuccal , mesiolingual , mid-lingual distolingual ) . Measurements PPD , BOP , GR perform use standard Florida Probe® handpiece ( Florida Probe Corp. , Gainsville , FL , USA ) . Clinical measurement take baseline , 4 week , 3 month ( visit 2a , 3a , 4a ) . Smoking habit determine objective chairside measurement carbon monoxide concentration exhale air ( Bedfont-Smokerlyzer® , Bedfont , UK ) visit 1 4 . Intraoral radiograph photograph take baseline . Specification Psychological Assessments At visit 2a 4a patient ask complete Oral Health Impact Profile - German Version ( OHIP-G 49 ) German version Client Satisfaction Questionnaire ( ZUF-8 ) standardize instrument use measure health outcome . Oral Health Impact Profile - German Version ( OHIP-G 49 ) The original English version questionnaire develop Slade Spencer ( 1994 ) . The German translation validation instrument perform John et al . ( 2002 ) . The OHIP-G 49 contains 49 item address specific problem oral health , e.g. , `` problem chew food '' `` pain gum '' . Each item assess five-point scale ( 0 : never 4 : often ) . A sum score item calculate indicator current oral health . The completion questionnaire take ten minute . ZUF-8 The patients´ satisfaction treatment evaluate mean Fragebogen zur Patientenzufriedenheit ( ZUF-8 , Schmidt et al . 1989 ) represent German version Client Satisfaction Questionnaire ( CQS , Attkisson &amp; Zwick 1982 ) . Microbiological Examination For microbiological analysis , pool subgingival plaque sample take four different teeth least one site PPDs ≥ 4 mm study subject . The pooled subgingival plaque sample collect transport tube contain 500 µl Ringer-Glycerin-Solution . The pooled sample take laboratory analysis store liquid nitrogen . Supragingival plaque collect four site per sample tooth . From buccal lingual site sample take use Periotron© adapt tooth surface collect dental plaque area near gingival margin . Interproximal , supragingival plaque sample collect insert sterile paperpoint horizontally buccal lingual direction near gingival margin . Samples buccal/lingual interproximal site pool respectively ( two pool sample subject per visit 2a , 3a , 4a ) seperate transport tube contain 500 µl Ringer-Glycerin-Solution . The pooled sample take laboratory analysis store liquid nitrogen . Sample teeth randomly select baseline show Fig . 2 assure equal distribution throughout mouth , remain course study . The whole bacterial count quantified culture study visit 2a , 3a , 4a . Laboratory Processing , Microbiological Analysis After subgingival plaque sampling , sample take immediately laboratory processing store liquid nitrogen study finish . After finish trial carry Münster . For transport store carbon dioxide snow store liquid nitrogen laboratory Münster . The pooled sample sonicated 10 second ( Sonotex RK 82 , Bandelin Electronic AG , Berlin , Germany ) dilute tenfold step . 0.1 ml undiluted suspension 0.1 ml aliquot dilution spread different culture medium . In parallel supragingival plaque sample spread CDC agar store aerobe atmosphere 37 degree zero overnight . For quantitative enumeration undiluted diluted suspension spread non-selective blood agar ( CDC agar ) plat contain 5 % defibrinated sheep blood supplement 5mg/l hemin ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) , 1 mg/l vitamin K1 , 10 mg/l N-acetylmuramine acid ( NAM ) . NAM supplement cultivation T. forsythensis . The plate incubate atmosphere contain N2 ( 85 % ) , H2 ( 10 % ) , CO2 ( 5 % ) 7 day . Total cultivable count assess plaque sample . The evaluation pool plaque sample CDC agar total cultivable count report quantitatively colony form unit ( CFU/ml ) . In investigation present specific periodontal pathogen evaluate .</detailed_description>
