	<brief_title>Effect Mucograft® Seal Post-extraction Ridge Preservation Using Bone Allograft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One serious consequence single multiple tooth extraction bone resorption follow , may create aesthetic problem compromise future implant placement . Ridge preservation procedure typically use combination scaffold membrane . Scaffolds commonly use bone graft ; autogenous , allograft , xenograft , alloplasts . Among bone graft , allograft material Demineralized Freeze Dried Bone Allograft ( DFDBA ) Freeze Dried Bone Allograft ( FDBA ) frequently use site preservation procedure . An additional alternative use collagen sponge ( CS ) extraction socket prevent infiltration soft tissue low area protect maintain bone graft material . Although ridge preservation several benefit , also several risk limitation , membrane exposure possible infection , loss fibrous encapsulation graft particle , long heal period prior implant placement , invasive technique sensitive procedure , additional cost , possible soft tissue dehiscence bone graft site compare non-grafted site . Therefore , modification technique reduce risk limitation would advantageous . Mucograft® TM specifically design soft-tissue regeneration . Its bi-layer structure support tissue in-growth regeneration promotes cellular extracellular integration within host tissue . Clinically , new collagen membrane associate sufficient width newly form attach gingiva coverage Miller class-I class-II recession defect . These result suggest use Mucograft® TM periodontal plastic surgery may provide viable source graft material alternative autogenous non-autogenous soft tissue graft material . This study clinical radiographic , randomize parallel arm comparative evaluation addition Mucograft® seal FDBA ridge preservation procedure . Group A receive FDBA CS . Group B receive FDBA Mucograft® seal .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Be least 18 year age . Have unsalvageable nonadjacent nonmolar teeth schedule extraction : maxillary incisor , canine , premolar , mandibular canine premolar require extraction ridge preservation plan delay implant placement . If subject multiple teeth extract , one tooth include study . Presence buccal plate extraction site determine first sectional CBCT scan . Patients currently treatment plan Tufts University School Dental Medicine ( TUSDM ) periodontology clinic receive ridge preservation meet medical dental requirement TUSDM periodontology clinic periodontal surgery ( e.g. , subject disease medication allergy contraindicate periodontal surgery ) . Display evidence acute periodontal infection : e.g. , abscess , suppuration , severe swell and/or spontaneous bleeding . Nonsmoker smoke less 10 cigarette per day . Not participate research study duration study . Have know disease interfere periodontal surgery would allow patient treatment plan procedure TUSDM periodontology clinic ( e.g. , severe anemia , low white blood cell count , bleed coagulation disorder , uncontrolled hypertension ( 150/90 ) , recent myocardial infarction ( within 6 month enrollment ) , diabetes ( HbA1C ≥7 % ) , HIV/AIDS ( selfreported ) , history currently undergo head neck radiation , history currently take bisphosphonates , endocrineinduced bone disease ( e.g . hyperparathyroidism ) , immunosuppressive therapy ) . Have limit mental capacity unable give inform consent . Be pregnant lactate female ( selfreported ) ( follow TUSDM periodontology clinic guideline elective surgical procedure radiographs/CBCT scan usually postpone delivery ) . Any known allergy/hypersensitivity FDBA ( contain trace amount gentamicin , providoneiodine ) , CS Mucograft® seal . Any known allergy yeast . Have untreated acute infection surgical site . Have untreated malignant neoplasm . Individuals oppose porcine derive material place mouth due personal reason religious reason . Teeth require flap reflection extraction , e.g . deep subgingival caries fracture .</criteria>
