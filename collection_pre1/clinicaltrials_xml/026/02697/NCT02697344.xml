	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid give together lenalidomide dexamethasone see well work treat patient multiple myeloma , also know plasma cell myeloma , come back period improvement gotten bad treatment . R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid may stop growth cancer cell recognize certain protein stimulate programmed cell death . Lenalidomide may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid lenalidomide dexamethasone may work well treat patient multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid ( AT-101 ) combine lenalidomide dexamethasone patient relapse symptomatic multiple myeloma ( MM ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine overall response rate ( partial response well ) AT-101 use combination lenalidomide dexamethasone patient relapse symptomatic MM . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival overall survival among patient relapse symptomatic MM follow treatment AT-101 combination lenalidomide dexamethasone . II . To determine toxicity associate AT-101 combination lenalidomide dexamethasone patient relapse symptomatic MM . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine vivo anti-myeloma effect AT-101 alone assess extent decrease M-protein ( serum and/or urine ) 1 cycle AT-101 alone . II . Determine pharmacodynamics effect AT-101 combination lenalidomide dexamethasone treatment primary myeloma cell vivo . III . Explore potential mechanism resistance AT-101 combination lenalidomide dexamethasone therapy role B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2 ) . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid follow phase II study . Patients receive R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid orally ( PO ) day ( QD ) day 1-21 . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 dexamethasone PO QD day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
