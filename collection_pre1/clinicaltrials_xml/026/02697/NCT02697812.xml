	<brief_summary>In North America , almost Â½ million people undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery annually 1/3rd develop chronic chest pain . The current study randomize cardiac surgery patient undergo slow sternal retraction heart exposure ( 15 min . ) versus standard-of-care ( sternal opening 30 second ) examine incidence severity chronic post-sternotomy pain ( CPSP ) quality-of life 3 , 6 12 month post-operatively . The severity acute post-operative pain also measure . Increased retraction time reduces force require , translate reduce nerve/tissue damage . If effective , simple change practice could readily implement major impact patient health care system overall .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Speed Sternal Retraction Affect Postoperative Pain Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective current investigation determine whether increase time sternal retraction 15 minute ( standard ~30 sec ) , result reduce acute chronic post-sternotomy pain improved quality life . The hypothesis increase time sternal retraction result : reduce required force , le physical trauma , less inflammation , less nerve damage . Specifically , hypothesis slow steady sternal retraction ( occur 15 minute ) 1 ) reduce incidence CPSP 40 % 2 ) reduce severity acute postoperative pain least 20-30 % 3 ) significantly improve quality life 6 month postoperatively . The current investigation prospective blind , randomize , control trial . Following institutional ethic approval sign consent , eligible patient schedule elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery randomly assign ( stratified gender surgeon ensure equality group ) either Standard group ( sternal retraction occur ~30s ) Slow group sternal retraction occur 15 minute . Patients research personnel perform postoperative assessment remain blinded group assignment conclusion investigation . All intra-operative variable perform per standard practice cardiac surgeon Kingston General Hospital . The extent sternal retraction surgeon 's discretion enable appropriate exposure heart allow safe conduct operation record case . The primary outcome measure incidence chronic post-sternotomy chest pain 6 month follow CABG median sternotomy . However , also measure incidence CPSP 3 12 month determine trajectory . Secondary outcome include : Pain intensity ( numeric rating scale-NRS ) chest pain ( differs preoperative ) rest cough daily hospital discharge 1 week postoperatively . Analgesic consumption ( morphine equivalent ) daily hospital discharge , 1 week post-operatively 3 , 6 , 12 month postoperatively . Intra-operative data include force sternal edge retraction ( maximal mean ) , time initiation full retraction , latency full retraction sternal closure , width sternal opening full retraction . Pain quality , quality life , pain interference daily function 3 , 6 12 month post-operatively . All assessment follow discharge hospital via telephone call research nurse blind randomization assignment . In-hospital assessment also do research nurse blind group assignment .</detailed_description>
