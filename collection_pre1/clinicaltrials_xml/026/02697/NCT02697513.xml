	<detailed_description>Infection sepsis among leading cause death worldwide . The annual burden infectious disease particularly high middle- low-income country . The Surviving Sepsis Campaign release guideline severe sepsis septic shock management , whose implementation improve sepsis outcome . Despite benefit , Surviving Sepsis Campaign implement middle- low-income country due lack training resource . This leave clinician care worldwide majority patient suffer acute infection without standardized adoptable guidance sepsis . The Surviving Sepsis Campaign launch initiative improve sepsis care resource-limited setting employ 'Scan-Teach-Treat ' Approach . This approach consist follow three step : Step 1 - scan region interest key element regional epidemiology acute infectious disease well element teach treat module ; Step 2 - implementing focused training program management acute infectious disease ; Step 3 - implementing 'Sepsis First Aid kit ' clinical practice . In prospective before-after study , approach pilot Gitwe Distict Hospital Gitwe , rural Rwanda . During three four month period , three intervention plan : First four month period : collection baseline data clinical management patient acute infection . Second four month period : During first day , 1.5-day focused training program perform ( participant : health care worker primary care facility within catchment area Gitwe hospital health care worker Gitwe hospital ) . Then , simple management protocol care patient acute infection implement clinical practice . During third four month period , 'Sepsis First Aid ' kit contain essential resource treat patient acute infection ( antimicrobial , fluid , data documentation sheet ) distribute primary care facility emergency department Gitwe hospital . During 8 month follow focused train program ( period 2 3 ) , data collection continue . It hypothesize implementation simple clinical management protocol exposure health care worker Gitwe Hospital area focus train program management acute infection increase rate evidence-based intervention perform patient acute infection first six hour hospital admission ( administration oxygen fluid whenever indicate , timely administration antimicrobial drug , source control measure ) . In addition main analysis , study endpoint analyze separately follow รก priori define sub-groups : child ( &lt; 15 year ) ; patient malaria ; patient positive HIV ; patient refer primary health care center .</detailed_description>
