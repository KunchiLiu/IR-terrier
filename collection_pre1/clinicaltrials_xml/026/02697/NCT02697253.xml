	<brief_summary>The goal project identify predictor success treatment obesity roux-en-y bariatric surgery . The specific aim proposal : 1. employ behavioral test mechanisms control food intake normal weight individual , determine intake control mechanisms lead change Roux-en-y gastric bypass ( RYGBP ) ; 2. measure behavioral psycho-social predictor weight loss food intake reduction , determine predictive successful weight loss food intake reduction . The mechanism investigator propose account success reduction food intake brought pattern hormone release , particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , gastric distention , know underlie satiation , couple post-ingestive change reinforce value food motivation consume . Tests hypothesis do measuring response taste , work , consume , food sensory , motivational , cognitive , physiological variable , include amount consume rate eat standardized condition , surgery two year follow visit . In addition inhibitor exendin-9-39 ( EX9 ) infuse meal determine whether blockade GLP-1 Receptor surgery partially reverse intake reduction . Investigators predict successful patient show change favor reduction food intake , rate eating , motivation consume , reward value food , hormone profile show generate satiation maintain reduction intake ( e.g . increase Cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , GLP-1 , reduce ghrelin ) . To extent psycho-social cognitive factor may override physiological brake eat behavior , subject may fail achieve success , consequently failure may predict over-impulsiveness inability suppress work reward food stimulus . To test hypothesis , total 50 patient enrol prior RYGBP restudied 2 year surgery . Based known high attrition population past 10 year experience bariatric research , estimate 100 patient need enrol 2 year obtain 50 complete test 2 year . EX9 study do subset 30 completers , roux-en-y gastric bypass ( RYGBP ) , 15 failure ( &lt; 15 % weight loss ) 15 success ( &gt; 30 % weight loss ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity major public health well economic ( expense treating ) problem world-wide , Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) Sleeve Gastrectomy ( SG ) surgery effective treatment . A barrier progress 25 % 40 % patient successful achieve maintain least 30 % weight loss , consider medically successful operation . Understanding mechanisms contribute success failure operation unsolved problem obesity research proposal address . The focus project identify mechanism contribute suppression food intake follow bariatric surgery , investigate whether mechanism predict long term success follow bariatric surgery</detailed_description>
