	<brief_summary>Back pain huge problem million Americans , include nearly 11 million Veterans . Our old Veterans suffer . Citizens spend billion dollar , yet consistently get poor result . Primary Care Providers often task diagnose treat Chronic Low Back Pain , even though often undereducated field . These PCPs often use advanced imaging , usually MRIs guide care . These image often show degenerative disc disease common pathology older adult , even pain free , lead misdiagnosis treatment . The investigator believe Chronic Low Back Pain syndrome , final common pathway expression multiple contributor often lie outside spine . For example , hip osteoarthritis , knee pain , even anxiety could lessen back pain address treat probably . Investigators measure participant ' low back pain-associated disability well-validated RMDQ . Data collect baseline monthly via telephone . The investigator hypothesize veteran receive PCCET experience significantly great reduction low back pain-associated disability receive IAUC six month . Investigators also measure participant ' low back pain 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale Pain . Data collect baseline monthly via telephone . The investigator hypothesize veteran receive PCCET experience significantly great reduction low back pain receive IAUC six month . The goal study compare patient treat usual care , usually start imaging , versus patient treat trained geriatrician know recognize address 11 key condition commonly drive pain disability old adult . The investigator believe old patient receive care tailor need educate PCPs ultimately less back pain , importantly , good quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Making Better Lives : Patient-Focused Care Low Back Pain ( LBP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly half 22 million US military Veterans age 65 older , within population , low back pain common , costly often disable . The prevalence low back pain 85+ , vulnerable fast grow segment society , estimate 44 % . Chronic low back pain ( CLBP , i.e. , present 6 month ) associate overwhelming majority healthcare resource utilization personal suffering . Treating back problem cost Americans $ 30 billion 2007- $ 16 billion 1997 ( 2007 dollar ) . Despite stagger data , evidence care patient CLBP improve , use invasive , potentially morbid , often ineffective intervention ( e.g. , epidural corticosteroid injection spine surgery ) continue skyrocket . Primary care provider ( PCP ) task treat CLBP without adequate education often use advanced imaging ( commonly magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) guide care . Imaging-identified pathology ( e.g. , degenerative disc facet disease , bulge disc ) ubiquitous old adult , even pain-free . It surprising , therefore , imaging-guided treatment often lead suboptimal outcome potential morbidity . In contrast CLBP often conceptualize treat , investigator conceptualize CLBP syndrome , , final common pathway expression multiple contributor often lie outside spine , example , hip osteoarthritis , fibromyalgia syndrome , anxiety . Treating CLBP ameliorate disability old adult necessitates address multiple condition risk factor ; however , expertise evaluate treat disorder contribute CLBP typically reside multiple specialty silo , make comprehensive approach treat CLBP difficult implement . Through support 2-year Rehab R &amp; D Merit Review pilot award , investigator lay essential foundation deliver comprehensive patient-centric care old Veterans CLBP . The investigator : - 1 ) synthesize , modify Delphi process , evidence evaluate treat 11 key condition commonly drive pain disability old adult CLBP - 2 ) create algorithm use clinical set treat 11 condition - 3 ) successfully trained geriatrician provider practical structure assessment 11 condition , - 4 ) validate prevalence condition specifically old Veterans In current application , investigator propose 2-site pilot study explore impact deliver patient-centered comprehensive evaluation treatment ( PCCET ) compare imaging-associated usual care ( IAUC ) old Veterans CLBP . In addition examine whether PCCET effective IAUC reduce pain functional limitation deliver geriatrician 2 VA medical center , investigator evaluate PCCET 's impact health-related quality life health care utilization . The investigator also collect data identify barrier facilitator implement PCCET perspective patient provider .</detailed_description>
