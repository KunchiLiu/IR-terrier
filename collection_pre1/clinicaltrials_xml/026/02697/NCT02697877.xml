	<brief_title>Assessment Global Myocardial Perfusion Reserve Using Coronary Sinus Flow Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myocardial perfusion reserve ratio global myocardial blood flow stress vs. rest . Traditionally , measure non-invasively use quantitative positron emission tomography ( PET ) cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) . Several recent study suggest measurement myocardial perfusion reserve provide significant additive prognostic information stress perfusion image patient know suspected coronary artery disease . Myocardial perfusion reserve depend trans-stenotic pressure gradient epicardial artery thus stenosis severity even ability coronary microvasculature ( especially pre-arterioles ) dilate . Therefore , coronary microvascular dysfunction , impair pre-arteriolar function , reduce myocardial perfusion reserve independently presence epicardial coronary stenosis . Hence , ability measure myocardial perfusion reserve allow comprehensive assessment entire coronary circulation , beyond current paradigm epicardial artery . However , PET current CMR technique cumbersome , case PET require radiation well on-site Rubidium-82 generator . Therefore , challenge routine clinical practice limit specialized research center . An alternative , simple CMR method measurement myocardial perfusion reserve quantify change coronary sinus flow describe . The coronary sinus drain approximately 96 % total myocardial blood flow provide potentially convenient location measurement global myocardial blood flow . This method validate invasive PET technique . The investigator hypothesize measurement coronary sinus flow stress rest may provide simple rapid assessment myocardial perfusion reserve regadenoson stress perfusion CMR . This study use phase contrast image obtain patient clinically indicate CMR stress study calculate myocardial perfusion reserve ratio maximum myocardial blood flow baseline blood flow - coronary sinus . Coronary sinus flow calculate post-processing image patient leave scanner . In brief , contour coronary sinus trace flow image throughout cardiac cycle . Coronary sinus flow calculate integrating momentary flow rate value cardiac phase entire cardiac cycle multiply mean heart rate acquisition . Patients follow occurrence major adverse cardiac event ( death , myocardial infarction , late revascularization , hospitalization heart failure unstable angina ) .</detailed_description>
