	<brief_summary>Insulin promote clearance sugar blood skeletal muscle fat cell use energy ; also promote storage excess nutrient fat . Type 2 diabetes occur cell body become resistant effect insulin , cause high blood sugar contribute build-up fat muscle , pancreas , liver , heart . Understanding insulin resistance occurs pave way new therapy aim prevent treat type 2 diabetes . Mitochondria cellular structure responsible turn nutrient food , energy cell run . As result , mitochondrion know `` powerhouse cell . '' Mitochondria dynamic organelle move within cell area need , fuse together form large , string-like , tubular network divide small spherical structure . The name process `` mitochondrial dynamic '' process keep cell healthy . However , food consume compare amount energy burn , mitochondrion may become overloaded dysfunctional result leak partially metabolized nutrient interfere ability insulin communicate within cell . This may way cell prevent uptake nutrient current supply exhaust . However , long term overload mitochondrion may cause blood sugar level rise lead development type 2 diabetes . This study provide information relationship mitochondrial dynamic , insulin resistance type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The traditional view mitochondrion isolate , spherical , energy produce organelle undergo revolutionary transformation . Emerging data show mitochondria form dynamic networked reticulum regulate cycle fission fusion . The discovery number protein regulate activity lead important advance understand human disease . Data show activation dynamin relate protein 1 ( Drp1 ) , protein control mitochondrial fission , reduce follow exercise prediabetes , decrease link increased insulin sensitivity fat oxidation . The propose research test hypothesis mitochondrial dynamic key mechanism insulin resistance type 2 diabetes . Translational first-in-man study use acute lipid challenge investigate physiological significance alter skeletal muscle mitochondrial dynamic insulin sensitivity human . The experimental approach harness innovative molecular cellular tool , interfaced physiologically significant human study obtain meaningful data insulin resistance , potential generate insight lead new diabetes therapy future generation .</detailed_description>
