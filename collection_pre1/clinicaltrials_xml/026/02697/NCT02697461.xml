	<brief_summary>Lateral ankle sprain ( LAS ) chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) common musculoskeletal injury result inversion injury sport . The midfoot frequently involve inversion injury , often overlooked clinical examination , maybe contributory development CAI . The purpose study investigate multisegmented foot motion use motion capture system , clinical joint physiological accessory motion , morphologic foot measurement recreationally active men woman without history lateral ankle sprain chronic ankle instability . Additionally , effect joint mobilization intervention patient diminish multisegmented foot motion intrinsic foot strengthen healthy individual investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Arm 1 : The purpose arm study determine foot muscle exercise change function foot . Up 25 people enrol arm study University Virginia . Arm 2 : The purpose arm study determine joint mobilization apply middle part foot effect function people healthy , history lateral ankle sprain ( LAS ) , chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) joint stiffness . Up 125 people enrol arm study University Virginia . CAI condition symptom ankle sprain last longer one year . These symptom include feel looseness , feeling participant may roll ankle , repeat ankle sprain . This study may help clinician prescribe simple exercise home help treat CAI . The participant ask study , physically active ( participate form physical activity least 20 minute per day , three day per week ) currently seek medical treatment/therapy LAS/CAI . Joint mobilization commonly use clinical intervention use decrease pain increase joint range motion . The home exercise employ study commonly use clinically treatment foot ankle problem include foot calf stretch stand one foot 60 second . The participant ask perform exercise three time daily throughout course day . The investigator hypothesize joint mobilization improve patient orient outcome measure joint mobility excursion individual impaired foot mobility immediately post intervention 1-week follow-up , 4 week ; intrinsic foot strengthen result difference morphologic measure intrinsic muscle cross-section healthy individual follow 4 week home exercise program .</detailed_description>
