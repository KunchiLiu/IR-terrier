	<brief_title>Evaluation New Method Instilling Eye Drops</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : The purpose project test alternative method instill eye drop . The new method involve patient self-administer eye drop onto skin medial canthus , lid gently close , open lid `` cold wet '' sensation eye drop felt along margin close lid . We compare physiological therapeutic efficacy instill eye drop eyes subject , use two method . The first eye drop administer use `` gold standard '' method employ optometrist instill eye drop office . The second employ new method self-administration described . HYPOTHESIS : Instillation eye drop , gently close lid medial canthus , physiological effect therapeutic efficacy drop agent , concentration , properly apply onto open eye train professional . Aim # 1 : Determine difference efficacy drop 0.5 % timolol maleate administer professional , use standard clinical method versus patient self-administration use newly propose method , NORMAL SUBJECTS . Aim # 2 : Determine difference efficacy glaucoma drop administer professional , use standard method versus patient self-administration drop , use newly propose method , GLAUCOMA PATIENTS . JUSTIFICATION : While new drug development glaucoma field seek address issue difficulty patient experience self-administration eye drop press new drug show efficacy daily dose routine , strategy potentially serious negative consequence . Clearly , glaucoma medication administer day , patient miss eye single instillation , period lapse treatment 24 hour . If disease worsen , either due non-compliance treatment regimen inability instill eye drop , require follow visit , additional medication , additional diagnostic test , early surgery . In regard , consequence non-compliance inability comply - increased blindness glaucoma increase cost associate try prevent blindness needlessly advance disease . OBJECTIVES : The objective proposal test therapeutic efficacy alternative method instill eye drop . This require compare effect volume drug , apply use classical method new alternative method . If propose study successful , reliable method instill drop kind , patient , validate .</detailed_description>
