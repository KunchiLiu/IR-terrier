	<detailed_description>In pragmatic , patient-centered clinical trial , investigator compare effectiveness two dos aspirin ( 81 mg 325 mg ) currently widespread use United States secondary-prevention population patient establish ASCVD . The trial use novel format use exist electronic health record ( EHRs ) , well web-based patient portal collect patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) , available patient encounter data supplement/support EHR . Patients identified candidate trial direct electronic patient portal eConsent well abbreviated eligibility confirmation randomization . One important aim ADAPTABLE engage patient , healthcare provider , trial investigator use infrastructure PCORnet develop continue refine . A total 20,000 high-risk patient ASCVD randomly assign ( open-label fashion ) 1:1 ratio instruction use daily aspirin dose either 81 mg 325 mg daily . The investigator expect entire sample patient enrol 24 month , maximum follow-up 30 month .</detailed_description>
