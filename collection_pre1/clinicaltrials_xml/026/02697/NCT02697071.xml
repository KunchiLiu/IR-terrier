	<brief_summary>This research study prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . Because ketamine yet directly study treatment acute migraine headache emergency department , research team initially interested ketamine reduce pain score headache patient reduce incidence recurrence exhibit adequate safety profile . By use placebo-controlled study design , research team adequately investigate effectiveness medication subgroup previously well study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose enrollment patient upon shortly presentation emergency department treatment ketamine placebo . 30 minute study drug administer , patient option request rescue medication order treat physician accord standard emergency department protocol . Pain score document use Numerical rating scale ( NRS-11 ) , 4-Point Pain Intensity Categorical Scale , 4-Point Functional Disability Scale 0 minute , 30 minute , 60 minute post treatment . Follow-up telephone call make 72-120 hour treatment assess incidence recurrence head pain patient satisfaction treatment . Subjects eligible study must present emergency department chief complaint primary headache determine non-emergent treating physician . Upon block randomization , subject receive intravenous dose 0.2 mg/kg , maximum dose 30mg , ketamine equivalent volume saline . After 30 minute patient ask need rescue medication , treat physician administer rescue treatment , request . The research hypotheses include : 1 . The proportion patient achieve significant pain reduction 30 minute higher ketamine treatment group compare placebo group . 2 . The proportion patient experience pain response , define &lt; 50 % reduction visual analog score compare baseline reduction 4-Point Pain Intensity Categorical Scale 1 0 , high patient receive ketamine compare receive placebo . 3 . Patients treat ketamine headache experience low recurrence rate within 24 hour 4 . Ketamine demonstrate adequate safety profile . The last two question exploratory include power analysis . It expect ketamine demonstrate satisfactory safety profile limited side effect . The proportion patient attain pain response expect high ketamine treatment group compare placebo . It also expect patient treated ketamine alone less likely experience recur headache within 72 hour treatment treat placebo rescue medication . The primary outcome achievement pain response 30 minute ketamine dose . Achievement pain response define reduction baseline pain score least 50 % NRS scale . Secondary outcome include attainment pain-free state , patient headache relief , recurrence headache , recovery functional disability , need rescue medication .</detailed_description>
