	<brief_summary>Postoperative brain damage neuropsychological disorder observe 30 - 80 % patient heart surgery use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) .They persist year cardiac surgery associate increase hospital mortality prolong intrahospital stay . Hypoperfusion , hyperthermia , atrial fibrillation , genetic predisposition systemic inflammatory response associate CPB identify pathophysiological mechanisms.However , author consider cerebral embolisation prevalent mechanism intraoperative brain injury cardiac surgery , gaseous solid cerebral embolus cause ischemia , inflammation edema , consequently cause cerebral infarction usually result stroke , coma , encephalopathy , delirium cognitive decline . Additionally , may impair cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR ) . Aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) preform full sternotomy standard approach treatment aortic valve disease . Minimally invasive ( MIS ) aortic valve replacement show reduce postoperative mortality , morbidity , pain provide faster recovery , short hospital stay , good cosmetic result . However , due technically demand procedure , MIS may lead prolonged CPB time incomplete de-airing heart increase risk cerebral gas embolization . Therefore , choice MIS might bear augment risk brain injury . Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) enable real time detection intraoperative emboli cerebral artery see microembolic signal ( MES ) , essential neuromonitoring tool . Several study demonstrate correlation number MES occurrence well severity postoperative neurological complication . However , factor contribute brain injury elucidate study . The investigator speculate impairment CVR important mechanism persist prolongs duration brain injury postoperative period . The aim study compare two surgical approach use AVR , focus number MES impact level protein S100B ( marker brain tissue damage ) , postoperative CVR cognitive function With result , investigator aim help surgeon select appropriate technique AVR individual participant , well clarify effect aortic valve surgery brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients undergo aortic valve replacement enrol study give sign informed consent divide two group depend type surgical technique . Either full sternotomy ( FS ) minimal invasive sternotomy ( MIS ) perform , use cardio-pulmonary bypass ( CPB ) .One week one week surgery patient undergo mini mental test measurement visually evoke cerebral blood flow velocity response ( VEFR ) .Levels S100B , interleukin ( IL ) 1 , IL 6 , IL 8 , IL 10 microparticles determine induction anesthesia , well 6 h , 24 h , 48 h 7 day CPB.Each patient invasive non invasive monitoring include near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , bispectral index ( BIS ) TCD surgery.MES detect use TCD follow time-points : beginning surgery , sternotomy , aortic cannulation , CPB , de-airing , open clamp aorta CBP removal chest closure.All data document well demographic characteristic patient , preoperative medical status , intraoperative data ( duration surgery , duration CPB , hemodynamic parameter , inotropic/vasoactive support , blood blood component ) ; duration mechanical ventilation intensive care unit ( ICU ) , duration ICU stay , 30-day mortality morbidity , well postoperative complication .</detailed_description>
