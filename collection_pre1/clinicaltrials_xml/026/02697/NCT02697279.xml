Traditional incision drainage ( I &amp; D ) , without pack cutaneous abscess long accept standard care . This procedure often painful patient . Additionally , compliance wound care follow-up present barrier proper care heal . Research suggest incision loop drainage abscess may another effective treatment simple cutaneous abscess .

	<detailed_description>Patients meet study criterion treatment simple cutaneous abscess desire part study , consent . Study subject enrol randomly assign either study control group . Control Group- standard I &amp; D method cutaneous abscess . Study Group- Loop Technique : 1 . Gather material bring bedside 2 . Clean area chlorhexidine iodine swab 3 . Anesthetize area 4 . Use scalpel make small 5mm incision fluctuant area abscess 5 . Explore cavity hemostat break loculations 6 . Make second incision le 4cm away first incision . Feel border abscess , try make second incision far within cavity . 7 . For large abscess repeat step 5 thus create several LOOPs . 8 . Irrigate cavity saline flush 9 . Pass hemostat incision pull loop vessel , penrose , bottom glove . Keep loop device equal length side . 10 . Tie loop device loosely 30cc syringe form LOOP . Usually 5-6 knot . This help prevent loop fall prematurely . 11 . Slide syringe , trim free end loop . Make sure loop mobile . 12 . Cover site dry dressing . Follow-Up- - Wound check 1-2 day - Patient may manage drain home rotate facilitate drainage prevent adhesion - Patient instructed return Emergency Department drain removal 5-7 day .</detailed_description>
