	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm Smoldering Multiple Myeloma confirm Department Pathology , base International Myeloma Working Group Criteria Serum Mprotein ≥3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cell ≥10 % , Absence anemia : Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl 2g/dL low limit normal Absence renal failure : calculated creatinine clearance ( accord CockcroftGault method , MDRD , CKDEPI formula ) &gt; 30 mL/min ( alternatively base standard creatinine level criterion 2 mg/dl ) Absence hypercalcemia : Ca &lt; 10.5 mg/dl ≤ 2.5 mmol/L Absence lytic bone lesion Absence Clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage ≥60 % Absence Involved : uninvolved serum free light chain ratio ≥100 Absence &gt; 1 focal lesion MRI study `` Highrisk SMM '' per Mayo Clinic Spanish PETHEMA criterion Measurable disease within past 4 week define one follow Serum monoclonal protein ≥ 1.0 g/dl Urine monoclonal protein &gt; 200 mg/24 hour Serum immunoglobulin free light chain &gt; 10 mg/dL AND abnormal kappa/lambda ratio ( reference 0.261.65 ) Age ≥18 year ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Ability give inform consent . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 K/μL Platelets ≥ 75 K/μL ( Platelet transfusion help patient meet eligibility criterion allow within 3 day study enrollment . ) Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL ( transfusion permissible ) Total bilirubin ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 X institutional upper limit normal Female patient : Are postmenopausal least 24 month Screening visit , OR Are surgically sterile , OR If childbearing potential , agree practice 2 effective method contraception , time , time signing informed consent form 90 day last dose study drug , OR Agree practice true abstinence line prefer usual lifestyle subject . ( Periodic abstinence [ eg , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ] withdrawal acceptable method contraception . ) Male patient , even surgically sterilize ( i.e. , status postvasectomy ) , : Agree practice effective barrier contraception entire study treatment period 90 day last dose study drug , OR Agree practice true abstinence line prefer usual lifestyle subject . ( Periodic abstinence ( eg , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ] withdrawal acceptable method contraception . ) Participation clinical trial , include investigational agent include trial throughout duration trial ; within least 5 halflives previous therapy smolder myeloma start trial . Prior therapy SMM proteasome inhibitor . Patients diagnosis MM per standard IMWG criterion Contraindication concomitant medication , include antiviral , anticoagulation prophylaxis , tumor lysis prophylaxis , hydration give prior therapy . Known allergy study medication , analogue , excipients various formulation agent . Uncontrolled hypertension diabetes . Females patient lactate positive serum pregnancy test screening period . Known GI disease GI procedure could interfere oral absorption tolerance ixazomib include difficulty swallow . Patient ≥ Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy pain clinical examination screen period . Evidence current uncontrolled cardiovascular condition , include uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina , myocardial infarction within past 6 month . Systemic treatment , within 14 day study enrollment , strong inhibitor CYP1A2 ( fluvoxamine , enoxacin , ciprofloxacin ) , strong inhibitor CYP3A ( clarithromycin , telithromycin , itraconazole , voriconazole , ketoconazole , nefazodone , posaconazole ) strong CYP3A inducer ( rifampin , rifapentine , rifabutin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital ) , use Ginkgo biloba St. John 's wort . Ongoing active systemic infection , know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive , know active hepatitis B virus hepatitis , know active hepatitis C virus hepatitis . Comorbid systemic illness severe concurrent disease , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study interfere significantly proper assessment safety toxicity prescribe regimen . Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . QTc &gt; 470 millisecond ( msec ) 12lead EKG obtain Screening period . If machine reading value , EKG review qualified reader confirm subsequent EKG . Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 2 year study enrollment previously diagnose another malignancy evidence residual disease . Patients nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ type exclude undergone complete resection . Failure fully recover ( ie , ≤ Grade 1 toxicity ) reversible effect prior chemotherapy . Inability swallow oral medication , inability unwillingness comply drug administration requirement GI procedure could interfere oral absorption tolerance treatment . Major surgery within 14 day prior enrollment . Radiotherapy within 14 day enrollment . If involved field small , 7 day consider sufficient interval treatment administration ixazomib . Central nervous system involvement ( base clinical assessment ) . Infection require systemic antibiotic therapy serious infection within 14 day study enrollment . No current antimyeloma bisphosphonate therapy ( however , prior bisphosphonates and/or bisphosphonate therapy due osteoporosis allow ) . Patients Paget 's disease bone . Patients previously treat ixazomib , participate study ixazomib whether treated ixazomib .</criteria>
