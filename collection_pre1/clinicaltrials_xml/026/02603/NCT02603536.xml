	<brief_title>WelTelOAKTREE : Text Messaging Support Patients With HIV/AIDS British Columbia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To provide weekly text message intervention 85 high risk HIV+ participant attend Oak Tree HIV Clinic order improve medication adherence , attendance appointment subsequently , CD4 count HIV viral load value 1 year period . Justification : In Canada , around 65,000 people live HIV/AIDS , approximately 14,300 woman . AntiRetroviral Therapy ( ART ) lead enormous improvement health survival individual HIV . Moreover , decrease amount virus circulate body ( viral load ) , HAART offer possibility treatment preventative measure . However , high level engagement care , timely initiation ARVs , adherence medication require maximize benefit HAART order prevent resistance , progression AIDS , transmission mortality . Unfortunately , engagement ongoing HIV care poor , one study United States ( US ) show 52 % retention care 1 year . Further , adherence among high-risk population low , woman less adherent partly due role care provider child partner , potential abuse partner relationship , fear stigma , homelessness , concern regard side effect . Conversely , active drug use ( especially cocaine ) , lack social support , depression variable affect men woman alike . Current method engagement care fail overcome barrier adherence , make find effective adherence intervention critically important . Mobile health ( mHealth ) , use mobile phone technology deliver health care , emerge area disease management assist patient adherence prolong chronic treatment regimens monitor care . A randomized control trial ( WelTelKenya1 ) , conduct Dr. Richard Lester et . al , test clinical effectiveness text message support HIV treatment adherence Kenya . WelTelKenya1 , 67 % woman , show patient receive text message support significantly high rate treatment adherence viral suppression patient receive standard care alone . In Canada , cell phone penetration exceed 70 % expect reach 100 % within next decade . The WelTel system offer clinical management model carry use standard service offer cellular network provider minimal additional infrastructure flexible scalable . The investigator complete one first study text message support HIV care Canada . The pilot study call WelTelBC1 involve 25 individual five patient group 1 ) Non-suppressed ( CD4 &lt; 200 , VL &gt; 250 ) ; 2 ) Youth ( age 14-24 ) ; 3 ) Mature ( Age ≥50 ) ; 4 ) English second language ; 5 ) Distance ( reside 3+ hour travel time clinic ) , receive weekly text message ask `` How ? '' Participants instruct respond `` OK '' let investigator know problem . Participants respond `` okay '' respond follow clinic nurse . The pilot study design look feasibility acceptability weekly text message intervention Canadian HIV+ population , result show intervention perceive beneficial among participant . In regard acceptability , pilot study extremely informative , enabled investigator engage participant previously see sporadically ; overcome gap prevent optimal care follow-up . In addition , see pilot project , reach need link care need prepare provide cell phone phone plan support without one ( 50 % enrol intervention own cell phone , 40 % unlimited text message - anecdotally patient engagement improve intervention ) . It critical expand program individual Oak Tree Clinic could benefit study efficacy intervention engage patient care improve adherence HAART . Research Method : Participant Selection Recruitment : A list patient CD4 count ≤500 previous prescription antiretroviral therapy ( pregnancy ) prior control year , well detectable viral load ( ≥200 ) control year assemble . The list review clinic physician , nurse , pharmacist , dietician , counselor , outreach worker social worker determine patient would benefit participate WelTel text messaging program ( i.e . poor engagement care , difficult contact , poor non-adherence ARV therapy , advance HIV infection/AIDS , vulnerable socially isolated patient ) . A consensus base approach use patient selection . In addition , 25 Oak Tree pilot study participant ( WelTelBC1 ) , invite current study . Once nominated , patient attend clinic clinical visit , introduce WelTel intervention concept . Those interested approach research staff full explanation . The intervention protocol use WelTelBC1 pilot study Oak Tree , develop use patient questionnaire well patient health care worker focus groups/interviews Oak Tree , yet similar intervention use initial WelTelKenya1 intervention . Following fully inform consent completion consent form , participant provide cell phone unlimited text message one , cell phone , plan top include unlimited text messaging service . Baseline clinical data include historical CD4 count , HIV viral load abstract patient chart . Additionally , study participant ask complete Quality Life Assessment ( QOL ) questionnaire ( SF-12 questionnaire ) study entry ( 0 month ) , mid-way study ( 6 month +/- 6 week ) study exit ( 12 month +/- 6 week ) . The questionnaire consist 12 question ; self-administered interviewer administer ; take 10 -15 minute complete . Intervention : The intervention protocol use WelTelBC1 pilot study . This model WelTelKenya1 intervention adapt Oak Tree Clinic patient population use patient questionnaire well patient health care worker focus group individual interview . Each Monday , patient receive text message number traceable clinic stating simply `` How ? '' Patients instruct respond message `` OK '' state problem . Messages review triaged daily program research team member case negative complex response OK , participant contact program nurse ( patient instruct NOT emergency service ) . Non-responders receive second text message Wednesday 12:00 pm ( 48 hour initial text sent ) , response , contact program nurse Wednesday afternoon Thursday morning follow-up . Data Collection : Participants wiwere ask ethnicity study enrolment . Participants also ask complete 12 question QOL assessment questionnaire study entry , mid-way study study end . Frequency attendance care assess outpatient clinic electronic booking system . Chart abstraction clinical health status include : participant age ( year ) , housing status , current illicit drug use postal code , CD4 count percentage , HIV viral load , antiretroviral drug ( ARV ) regimen ( include date initiation discontinuation ) , degree medication adherence ( determined timing ARV refill , self-report ) , collect baseline clinical visit follow one year . All available like data one year prior ( 2 year Pilot Study ) enrollment WelTel program alsocollected participant serve control intervention ( repeat measure study ) , year follow intervention assess longevity intervention 's impact . Staff cost / saving calculate look Pharmacy , Nursing Outreach worker time use prior throughout intervention . The planned duration intervention one year , study , 18 month . At time data analyze program evaluate .</detailed_description>
