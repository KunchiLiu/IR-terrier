	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability investigational drug , MRG-201 , healthy volunteer . MRG-201 designed mimic activity molecule call miR-29 decrease expression collagen proteins involve scar formation . MRG-201 studied determine limit formation fibrous scar tissue certain disease . MRG-201 test healthy volunteer injection intact skin adjacent short skin incision . Volunteers may receive one several dose MRG-201 , monitor local reaction skin , sign symptom adverse effect body , level MRG-201 blood time . Skin biopsy also collect study cell skin respond expose MRG-201 .</brief_summary>
