	<brief_summary>Previous research identify spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leakage cause spontaneous intracranial hypotension , lead positional headache pattern . Typical magnetic resonance imaging finding include subdural fluid collection , enhancement pachymenginges , engorgement venous structure , pituitary hyperemia , sag brain ( SEEPS ) . Because pituitary hyperemia document case spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leakage know mimic pituitary tumor hyperplasia , investigator would like like assess clinical manifestation neuroimaging abnormality SIH patient regard pituitary gland . Specifically , investigator look analyze compression pituitary stalk conduct systemic evaluation pituitary function SIH patient .</brief_summary>
