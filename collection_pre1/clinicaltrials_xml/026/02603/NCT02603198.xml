	<brief_summary>Dental treatment , particularly third molar extraction , become extremely uncomfortable painful . They associate anxiety , fear many unpleasant sensation . During surgery , patient present cardiorespiratory repercussion sensation . This fact generally justify employment method monitor appliance safer therapeutic alternative . Local anesthetic frequently drug use dentistry . Vasoconstrictors , particularly epinephrine , important component anesthetic solution increase time anesthetic absorption consequently increase duration anesthesia . The use small amount anesthetic solution reduce risk systemic toxicity , however decrease total surgical time . It well known amount epinephrine inject patient anesthetic procedure produce adverse hemodynamic effect . Levonordefrin add dental cartridge promise reduce cardiac stimulation due less Î² activity , maintain clinical systemic effect . But study maxillary intraosseous infiltration show difference heart rate anesthetic success epinephrine . Thus , study aim compare clinical efficacy safety anesthetic mepivacaine 2 % epinephrine 1:100,000 1:20,000 levonordefrin employ clinical trial model third molar extraction healthy adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>2 % -Mepivacaine With Two Different Vasoconstrictors Solutions Third Molar Surgery Comparative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 healthy patient , gender 18 40 years-of-age necessity bilateral third molar removal similar surgical difficulty recruit Dental Public University Clinic . Inclusion criterion include : non-smoking participant , minimum 50 Kg weight . After clinical radiographic examination , randomize accordingly side operate two group : MEPI-LEVO MEPI-EPI . There memory-washout 15days surgery . In MEPI-LEVO group , patient receive local anesthesia employ 2 % chloridrato mepivacaine 1:20.000 levonordefrin maximum four cartridge anesthesia . The side receive 2 % chloridrato mepivacaine 1:100.000 epinephrine maximum amount . The surgery group follow strictly pattern minimum surgical trauma high cautious antiseptic condition . The surgeon tooth extraction anesthesia do another oral surgeon order blind type anesthetic solution operator ( type vasoconstrictor use ) . The amount bleed quantify immediately suture blind observer record visual analogical scale 0 10 point , 0 correspond absence bleed 10 excessive bleeding . Blood pressure heart rate access five different moment : 1 . 20minutes surgical procedure patient await room ; 2 . 5 minute procedure patient seat dental chair ; 3 . 5 minute anesthesia procedure ; 4. osteotomy/tooth section 5. 10 minute suture . Patients surgery receive diary record time anesthesia sensation end , amount analgesic consume level pain visual analogic scale . The data submit statistical analysis p &lt; 0.05 significance .</detailed_description>
