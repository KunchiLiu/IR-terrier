	<brief_title>Prevalence COPD Our Lung Cancer Population , Compared Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) breathing problem people develop . Usually cause smoking . Damage lung mean patient risk chest infection unable exercise like healthy individual . They may also long-standing cough . COPD diagnose test lung function , usually use small device call spirometer . COPD become well understood condition . It known lung patient COPD sometimes inflame . This important inflammation associate type cancer , include lung cancer . The investigator interest whether COPD put people high risk lung cancer . They would like find common COPD patient lung cancer . The investigator would also like find common COPD patient know lung cancer ( comparison group ) . This help interpret result good investigator able compare two group .</detailed_description>
