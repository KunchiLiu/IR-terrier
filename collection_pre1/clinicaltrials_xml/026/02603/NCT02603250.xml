	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate use noninvasive Hb device ( Pronto® DCI-mini™ sensor ) accurate method measure Hb level among child 6 59 month standard reference hematology analyzer . The secondary purpose evaluate accuracy two HemoCue® Hb 201+ capillary blood collection method standard reference hematology analyzer . The study hypothesize Pronto® DCI-mini™ sensor approximate Hb value within ±1.0 g/dL secondly , correctly classify participant anemic anemic less 31 % disagreement compare standard reference hematology analyzer among child 6 59 month age . Additionally , two different HemoCue® Hb 201+ capillary blood collection methodology approximate Hb value within ±1.0 g/dL secondly , correctly classify participant anemic anemic less 35 % disagreement compare standard reference hematology analyzer among child 6 59 month age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Hb value 132 child , 6 59 month age obtain , use three different Hb assessment method assessment visit comparison standard reference hematology analyzer ( Sysmex KN21 ) result . The purpose research : 1 ) To evaluate accuracy noninvasive Masmio Pronto® device DCI-mini sensor measure Hb compare measure Hb use standard reference hematology analyzer , 2 ) To evaluate accuracy HemoCue® Hb 201+ gravity wicking methodology capillary blood collection standard reference hematology analyzer . To validate determine accuracy Pronto® DCI-mini™ sensor , 132 Pronto® Hb value compare Hb value obtain standard reference hematology analyzer determine overall average difference measurement exceed 1.0g/dL . To validate determine accuracy two HemoCue® 201+ blood collection method , 50 % child Hb measure use wicking method 50 % Hb measure use gravity method . The Hb value obtain two different HemoCue® 201+ blood collection method compare standard reference hematology analyzer determine overall average difference method standard reference within 1.0g/dL . For child , study nurse/coordinator : collect health information child , categorize skin pigmentation use Massey Martin NIS Skin Color Scale , measure record finger diameter use Masimo finger measure tool ( none finger appropriate size sensor , big toe measure use instead ) . Capillary blood sample child take via finger prick third fourth digit . If child 6-11 month acutely malnourish ( determine weight-for-height Z score ) , blood drop obtain heel accordance Hemocue® 201+ protocol ensure finger bone injure due insufficient finger padding . For blood sampling location , first two drop blood wipe away third blood drop use . The randomization process data analysis phase blind . To determine accuracy noninvasive device , difference Hb value obtain Pronto® DCI-mini™ sensory standard reference hematology analyzer ( Sysmex KN21™ ) calculate child average obtain . In addition mean difference ( bias ) , standard deviation , 95 % confidence interval , range , limit agreement also obtain . Accuracy Hb measurement noninvasive device assess determine whether measurement obtain noninvasive device fall within ±1.0 g/dL standard reference . With 100 sample assume correlation measurement method least 0.93 , 97-99 % power confirm average difference two Hb measurement method exceed 1.0 g/dL . This analysis conduct use pair t-test since test limit difference measure . The prevalence rate anemia also estimate group noninvasive measurement comparison standard reference measurement analyze paired t-test . For comparison , sample size 100 affords u enough power determine participant correctly classify anemic anemic , less 31 % disagreement . A similar process follow two HemoCue® Hb 201+ capillary blood collection methodology comparison standard reference hematology analyzer use pair t-test test limit difference measure . With 50 sample assume correlation measurement method least 0.93 , 77-99 % power confirm average difference two Hb measurement method standard reference exceed 1.0 g/dL . The prevalence rate anemia also estimate HemoCue® 201+ study arm comparison standard reference measurement analyze paired t-test . For comparison , sample size 100 enables u test participant correctly classify anemic anemic , less 35 % disagreement .</detailed_description>
