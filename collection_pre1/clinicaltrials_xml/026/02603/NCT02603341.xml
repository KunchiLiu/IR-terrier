	<brief_title>Pragmatic Randomized Trial Proton vs. Photon Therapy Patients With Non-Metastatic Breast Cancer : A Radiotherapy Comparative Effectiveness ( RADCOMP ) Consortium Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because one know radiation treatment best , decide take part study , randomly assign 1 2 treatment group , begin radiation treatment accord usual medical practice . Randomly assign group help make sure group similar mix patient make study well - do doctor sure whether one treatment well . You equal chance get either treatment group , like coin flip . Both doctor tell treatment get . No matter group patient , doctor work carefully reduce radiation healthy tissue . Both group follow least 10 year complete radiation therapy . The result study help decide radiation best future patient type breast cancer .</detailed_description>
