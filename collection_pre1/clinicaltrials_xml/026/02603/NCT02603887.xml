	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Smoldering Multiple Myeloma ( SMM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 21-day cycle , 8 cycle ( 6 month ) . At end 8 cycle , doctor think clinical benefit pembrolizumab , may choose continue receive pembrolizumab additional 16 cycle . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycles 1-24 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test check status disease . If become pregnant , part blood urine use pregnancy test . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) urine also collect study pembrolizumab work body . - Urine collect 24 hour routine test . On Days 2 15 Cycle 1 , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) urine also collect study pembrolizumab work body . End Cycle 8 24 : - You 2 bone marrow biopsies/aspirations check status disease biomarker testing , include genetic biomarkers . - You skeletal survey check status disease . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test check status disease . - Urine collect 24 hour routine test . - If doctor think need , FDG PET/CT MRI . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 24 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . End-of-Treatment Visit : Once longer take study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test check status disease . - You 2 bone marrow biopsies/aspirations check status disease biomarker testing , include genetic biomarkers . - Urine collect 24 hour routine test . - You skeletal survey check status disease . - If doctor think need , FDG PET/CT MRI . Follow-Up : Every 6 12 month last dose study drug : - Urine collect 24 hour routine test . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test check status disease . - If doctor think need , skeletal survey , FDG PET/CT , MRI check status disease . - If doctor think need , 2 bone marrow biopsies/aspirations check status disease biomarker testing , include genetic biomarkers . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA approve treatment certain type melanoma . Its use patient SMM investigational.The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 16 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
