	<criteria>Established , genetically confirm diagnosis FSHD . Onset FSHD sign symptoms prior 10 year age , document patient 's medical record base patient family report . Provide write informed consent assent In Investigator 's opinion , patient willing able complete study procedure comply weekly study visit schedule . Currently receive treatment immunomodulatory agent include targeted biological therapy within 3 month baseline ; corticosteroid within 3 month baseline ; highdose nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent within 2 week baseline . Currently receive curcumin albuterol ; use product putatively enhance muscle growth activity chronic basis within 4 week baseline ; statin treatment initiation significant adjustment statin regimen within 3 month baseline ( stable , chronic statin use permissible ) . Use investigational product device within 30 day baseline . Evidence alternative diagnosis FSHD coexist myopathy dystrophy , base prior muscle biopsy available investigation . History severe restrictive obstructive lung disease , evidence interstitial lung disease screen chest radiograph . History antisynthetase syndrome , prior Jo1 Abpositivity , positive equivocally positive Jo1 Ab test result screening . Chronic infection , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , human immunodeficiency virus history tuberculosis . Vaccination within 8 week baseline vaccination plan study participation . Symptomatic cardiomyopathy severe cardiac arrhythmia , may , Investigator 's opinion , limit patient 's ability complete study protocol . Muscle biopsy within 30 day baseline .</criteria>
