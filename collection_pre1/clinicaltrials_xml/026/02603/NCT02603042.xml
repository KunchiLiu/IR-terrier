	<detailed_description>Hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) rare genetic disorder characterize abnormal devel-opment bone teeth . These abnormality occur due defective mineralization , process bone teeth take mineral calcium phosphorus . These mineral require proper hardness strength . Defective mineralization result bone soft prone fracture deformity . Defective mineralization teeth lead premature tooth loss . The specific symptom vary greatly one person another , sometimes even among member family . There five major clinical form HPP range extremely severe form cause stillbirth form associate premature loss baby ( deciduous ) teeth , bone abnormality . Hypophosphatasia cause mutation tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase ( ALPL ) gene . This gene also know TNSALP gene . Such mutation lead low level tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase enzyme . Depending specific form , hypophosphatasia inherit auto-somal recessive autosomal dominant manner . Hypophosphatasia extremely variable disorder . Five major clinical form identify base primarily upon age onset symptom diagnosis . These know perinatal , infantile , childhood , adult , odontohypophosphatasia . Generally , severity different form hypophosphatasia correlate residual alkaline phosphate activity body , less enzyme activity cause severe dis-ease . Because hypophosphatasia highly variable disorder , important note affect individual may symptoms every individual case unique . Some child develop severe complication early life ; others mild disease may improve young adult life . Perinatal hypophosphatasia associate profound inactivity alkaline phosphatase markedly impaired mineralization . Consequently , skeleton fails form properly womb . Specific skeletal malformation may vary , short , bow arm leg underdeveloped rib often occur . Some pregnancy end stillbirth . In case , affect newborns survive several day , pass away respiratory failure due deformity chest underdeveloped lung . Infantile hypophosphatasia may noticeable abnormality birth , symptom may become apparent time within first six month . The initial symptom may failure gain weight grow expect rate age gender refer `` failure thrive . '' Some affected baby later exhibit early fusion bone skull ( craniosynostosis ) , result head appear disproportionately wide ( brachycephaly ) . Craniosynostosis may associate increased pressure cerebrospinal fluid , condition know `` intracranial hypertension . '' This complication cause headache , swell optic disk ( papilledema ) , bulge eye ( proptosis ) . Affected infant soften , weaken bone lead skeletal malformation rickets . Rickets bone disease occur growth soften bone characteristic bowing deformity legs growth plate abnormality . Enlarged wrist ankle joint may occur . Affected infant may also deformities chest rib rib fracture , predispose pneumonia . Varying degree pulmonary insufficiency breathe difficulty may develop , potentially progress life-threatening respiratory failure . Episodes fever bone pain , tender bone may occur . Some infant exhibit diminished muscle tone ( hypotonia ) baby appear `` floppy '' well elevate level calcium blood ( hypercalcemia ) . Hypercalcemia cause vomiting , constipation , weakness , poor feeding . In rare case , vitamin B6-dependent seizure may occur . Increased excretion calcium may lead kidney ( renal ) damage . Sometimes spontaneous improvement mineralization early childhood , exception craniosynostosis . Short stature skeletal deformity may persist lifelong . Childhood hypophosphatasia highly variable , less severe infantile form . Affected child may sometimes craniosynostosis exhibit sign intracranial hypertension . Skeletal malformation resemble rickets may become apparent 2 3 year age . Bone joint pain fracture may occur . Baby teeth may fall early normal . Some child weak experience delay walking , learn walk may distinct , waddle gait . Spontaneous remission bone symptom report young adult life , symptom recur middle-age late adulthood . Adult hypophosphatasia characterize wide variety symptom . Affected individual osteomalacia , soften bone adult . Some individual history rickets childhood , experienced premature loss baby teeth . Individuals adult hypophosphatasia experience fracture , especially stress fracture foot pseudofractures thigh . Repeated fracture result chronic pain debility . Fractures spine seem less common , also occur . Bone pain common complication . Some affect adult develop joint inflammation pain near around certain joint due accumulation calcium crystal ( calcific periarthritis ) condition call chondrocalcinosis , characterize accumulation calcium crystal within cartilage joint , sometimes damaging joint . Others sudden , severe pain joint ( pseudo gout ) . Affected adult may experience loss adult teeth . Odontohypophosphatasia characterized premature loss teeth childhood , loss teeth adulthood . It isolate find occur along characteristic bone symptom form hypophosphatasia . For hypophosphatasia , mutation ALPL gene inherit autosomal recessive autosomal dominant manner . The perinatal infantile form HPP inherit autosomal recessive manner . The childhood form autosomal recessive autosomal dominant . The adult form odontohypophosphatasia typically autosomal dominant disorder , rare case inherit autosomal recessive trait . A diagnosis hypophosphatasia base upon identification characteristic sign symptom , detailed patient history , thorough clinical evaluation , variety laboratory test include x-ray study . Proper diagnosis hypophosphatasia easy physician familiar experienced disorder . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
