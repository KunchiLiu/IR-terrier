	<brief_title>Elastography Liver Cystic Fibrosis Patients . Diagnostic Prognostic Aspects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 209 CF patient attend Stockholm Cystic Fibrosis Center ( January 2010 ) . All till 15 year age screen liver disease annually ultrasound ( US ) also biochemical marker . Ultrasound perform every third year 15 year age patient without CFLD , diagnose CFLD continue investigate annually . Biochemical marker control least every year CF patient . Elastography liver plan together investigation annual follow , optimal clinical status . If either US elastography liver indicate liver disease progress already exist pathological change , liver biopsy perform accord routine procedure Stockholm CF Centre . Also , historical data liver biopsy biochemical investigation consider study . Elastography liver perform Fibroscan device , transducer child adult , respectively . Clinical importance Liver US investigation CF patient important implication difficult standardize routine clinical setting . Elastography may advantage evaluation early fibrosis clinical importance pursue diagnostics intensify treatment . A significant group ( 25 % ) CF patient may help novel method . Including histological data , accuracy elastography CF patient may improve . Further detail importance fatty acid status CF may elucidate .</detailed_description>
