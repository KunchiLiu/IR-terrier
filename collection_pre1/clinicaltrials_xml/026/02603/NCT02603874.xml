	<brief_summary>The current method incision localization many surgical procedure require doctor reference medical image , X-ray , judge body incision make . However , precise information scan show patient 's skin . Surgeons commonly use palpation locate point incision . They may feel area directly find landmarks skin estimate location . This challenge due difficulty feel distinguish vertebra , especially new surgeon , since palpation skill derive experience . If palpation prove ineffective , may force use fluoroscopy . By reference fluoroscopy image surgeon move radiopaque marker , surgical tool , close area interest . Fluoroscopy time-consuming , expose medical personnel patient radiation . Many fluoroscopic image may require single procedure . The purpose study test efficacy benefit new medical device aid radiological localization . The hypothesized outcome would small incision , fast localization reduction fluoroscopy use . By identify efficacy new medical device , `` Target Tape '' , potential outcome make small incision , fast localization , reduction fluoroscopy use reduce chance surgical error associate cost . Target Tape non invasive device grid format place subject 's skin . The grid pattern appear medical imaging scan . The medical practitioner correlate device grid body medical scan image make incision accurate location .</brief_summary>

A representative Target Tape Inc may hand aid process may also observe say procedure record necessary information . The consent form sign Target Tape utilized procedure . The methodology create outcome measure occur 2 stage multiple step stage : Stage I : Proof Concept 1 . Specify measurement goal 2 . Proof Concept Testing 3 . Item generation 4 . Item reduction Stage 2 : Verification 5 . Verification Testing 6 . Reliability 7 . Validity 8 . Interpretability ( ) Subjects ( ii ) Involved Groups ( iii ) Data Collection ( iv ) Statistics Stage 1 : Proof Concept 1 . Measurement goal The specific measurement goal verify specific procedure benefit Target Tape . This serve primary evidence , beyond initial feedback opinion medical professional . Based benefit procedure , significant performance variable determine measure Stage 2 test . The significant performance variable may either qualitative quantitative : - Ease use ( surgeon opinion ) - Usefulness ( surgeon opinion ) - Time analysis - Incision length - Fluoroscopy use Other variable may need collect certain subject characteristic ( ie . age , gender , height , weight skin pigmentation ) . These variable help control effect variable skin characteristic may affect performance Target Tape . Based upon interview medical profession surgeon radiologist , initial target procedure include stabilization fracture , tumor removal , fusion , discectomies kyphoplasties . This research intend multi participant study may include variety different spine physician interested utilizing device procedure . The overall method use test remains consistent various participant . 2 . Proof Concept Testing When target procedure schedule occur , surgeon first determine Target Tape would appropriate use . The procedure need able integrate Target Tape use Method Use describe . The decision pursue procedure discretion medical practitioner consent patient . Depending procedure , medical practitioner may need communicate OR radiology department integrate Target Tape protocol , since practitioner make incision ( ) may always one applying . Once procedure determine appropriate accommodate Target Tape , medical practitioner approach prospective patient explain device utilize , benefit potential risk associate , answer question patient may . The consent form sign Target Tape utilized procedure . 3 . Variable generation Item generation conduct two stage . First , list item create current outcome . The item group accord domain : ease use , device limitation , patient characteristic , time analysis , incision length fluoroscopy use . Second , list distribute surgeons/medical practitioner use device miss item include . It anticipate 10 procedure would use device . 4 . Variable reduction The list item generate step administer doctor ask rate item accord importance . Any item deem insignificant remove list . The objective item reduction step find variable important patient , doctor , hospital . Furthermore , definitive list target procedure choose , procedures observed benefit take list . Stage 2 : Verification 5 . Verification Testing Subject test result Stage 1 , set significant performance variable determine respective target procedure . The significant variable may include time OR , incision length fluoroscopy exposure . The purpose Stage 2 would verify significant variable procedure . Exclusion criterion would create base upon outcome Stage 1 . Target Tape would randomly utilized procedure , control perform procedure patient characteristic ( gender , age , weight , height skin pigmentation ) . Observation significant performance variable occurs procedure . The significant variable may highly dependent upon medical practitioner ; therefore , sample size related number procedure respective practitioner performs give amount time . Stage 2 may necessary step initial development Target Tape ; due simplicity device well qualitative factor , cost-benefit analysis may necessarily require lengthy statistical study . 6 . Reliability Reliability refers consistency tool ; tool criterion test measure significant performance variable . The device use design throughout Stage 2 . 7 . Validity Validity refers well instrument ( i.e . criterion test ) measure claim measure . The different type validity : face , content , construct criterion validity . Face validity ensure significant performance variable make sense ensure throughout creation criterion involve surgeon , radiologists patient . Content validity extent instrument cover representative sample domain question . Again ensured creation tool involve surgeon , radiologists patient . Construct validity assess factor affect rating . Construct validity also assess look floor ceiling effect . Criterion validity may assess , extent utilization Target Tape predictive surgical outcome ( i.e . incision length , radiation exposure , procedure time ) . 8 . Interpretation Quantitative measurement measure absolute scale : incision length measure millimeter , procedure time second , fluoroscopy exposure number 'shots ' well time live exposure second ( possible ) . Controls patient characteristic record absolute value , i.e . 37 year , 5 ' 8 '' 160 lb . In interpretation analysis , control may group . There also measure surgeon 's opinion qualitative 'ease use ' qualitative 'usefulness ' . This would 10 , 10 mark represent best possible score . In case , zero would difficult use see usefulness , respectively . These score would convert percentage . They interpret find relative usefulness across various surgical procedure , well effect independent variable ( i.e . physical control ) . ( ) Subjects The population Target Tape design individual undergoing medical procedure medical imaging scan utilized assist incision localization . These medical imaging scan may include X-ray , fluoroscopy , CT MRI . Depending nature procedure , scan ( ) may do preoperative intraoperative . The surgeon may use scan image conjunction palpation determine incision site . Examples possible procedure include stabilization fracture , tumor removal , fusion , discectomies kyphoplasties . Although condition represent procedure occur patient age , population study direct would allergic medical adhesive , medical skin ink , and/or copper metal . The designated surgeon medical practitioner carry subject recruitment appropriate time preoperative imaging operation . Those agree may ask complete consent form time . Sample size Stage 1 : 1-2 Spinal surgeon 10 patient The number medical practitioner type procedure may fluctuate . The number patient may vary depend relative magnitude observation feedback medical practitioner . Stage 2 : The sample size segment stage correspond sample size use create outcome measure different population . After Stage 1 complete , sample sizes Stage 2 assess statistical model create time . A preliminary estimate would require 5 time sample size per procedure Stage 1 sufficient .</detailed_description>
