	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial study copper Cu 64 TP3805 ( Cu-64-TP3805 ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) detect cancer patient prostate cancer undergoing surgery remove entire prostate tissue around ( radical prostatectomy ) . Many patient benign lesion must undergo biopsy test lesion . Cu-64-TP3805 radioactive substance attache cancer cell normal cell . PET/CT use scanner make detail , computerized picture area inside body radioactive substance lighting . Using Cu-64-TP3805 PET/CT scan compare cancer tissue obtain surgery may help doctor learn whether Cu-64-TP3805 PET/CT accurately detect prostate lesion determine whether cancerous benign , may minimize need prostate biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess ability Cu-64-TP3805 detect prostate cancer ( PC ) within prostate gland , compare whole mount step-sectioned surgical pathology prostate radical prostatectomy . OUTLINE : Patients receive copper Cu 64 TP3805 intravenously ( IV ) undergo PET/computed tomography ( CT ) 30 minute 2 hour post-injection . Patients undergo radical prostatectomy within 1 3 week scan . After completion study , patient follow 24 hour .</detailed_description>
