	<brief_title>Feasibility Software App Testing Inattention Delirium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium acute , serious syndrome involve abnormality attention , arousal cognition . Delirium affect 1 8 hospital patient . Delirium link high risk death , increase length stay , substantial patient carer distress . Despite massive medical importance , delirium grossly underdetected , rate formal detection 20 % less . Investigators previously develop new neuropsychological test objective measurement inattention delirium , implement computerised device ( Delbox ) . A prototype software application smartphones ( DelApp ) develop base 'Delbox ' test . Findings two pilot study suggest DelApp performs well method objectively measure attention delirium . As part new programme work attentional test delirium , formally fund Medical Research Council ( grant value £1.01M ) , investigator plan study refine DelApp conduct large scale formal study . The reason additional study : ( 1 ) shorten duration DelApp assessment; ( 2 ) ask end user ( i.e . clinician ) evaluate user interface; ( 3 ) gather feedback end user regard ease use test; feedback clinician patients; finally ( 4 ) develop DelApp software application base user feedback . Here investigator propose preliminary qualitative study evaluate feasibility optimise DelApp test ( point 2 3 ) . Investigators assess usability acceptability ask 40 clinical staff administer DelApp test consent patient ( N=10 ) colleague ( approximately N=30 ) . Feedback collect clinician patient semi-structured interview . The outcome feasibility study make optimisation app possible , preparation formal validation study .</detailed_description>
