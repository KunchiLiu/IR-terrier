	<detailed_description>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) heterogeneous group stem cell disorder characterize ineffective hematopoiesis dysplasia propensity acute myeloid leukemia . Patients affect elderly global incidence 10/100,000/year . During past 3 year , significant progress make understand molecular pathogenesis identification mutation epigenetic gene like TET2 , ASXL1 , EZH2 , RUNX1 , DNMT3A , IDH1/2 , transcription factor , signal molecule , cohesion splice regulator . Inactivating mutation target hematopoietic stem cell may alter gene expression pattern could early mechanism clonal selection . However , single genetic alteration readily recapitulate apoptotic dysplastic phenotype . Several clone may co-exist , architecture still unclear . This study aim prospectively enrol cohort 350 incident case diagnosis , identify evaluate impact recurrent mutation overall survival event-free survival , use next generation sequence . Considering current knowledge , investigator propose : - perform whole exome sequence identify new mutation subset 30 patient diagnosis 10/30 sample follow-up , validate recurrence new mutation training set . - validate high throughput technology extensive genotyping determine mutational status 54 target gene entire prospective cohort . - analyze frequency impact phenotype , OS EFS frequent mutation include SF3B1 , SRSF2 , ZRSR2 , U2AF1 , TET2 , ASXL1 , EZH2 , IDH1/2 , DNMT3A , NRAS , TP53 , RUNX1 possibly newly discover new mutation . Individual follow-up 36 month . As ancillary study , evolution mutation profile leukemic transformation 10/30 MDS test WES , evaluation response treatment 100 MDS include clinical trial `` Groupe Francophone des Myélodysplasies '' analyze . Understanding clonal architecture diagnosis leukemic transformation crucial knowledge pathophysiology MDS . Better knowledge could help adapt therapeutic strategy . The study help delineate pattern gene mutation independent prognostic value modify natural course disease . Then , investigator apply grant support medico-economic evaluation molecular diagnosis MDS .</detailed_description>
