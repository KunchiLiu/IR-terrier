	<detailed_description>Background Tourette 's syndrome ( TS ) characterize occurrence , 18 year age , multiple motor vocal tic , necessarily occur concomitantly . Tics constitute clinical hallmark TS ; sudden , brief , intermittent involuntary ( semi-involuntary ) movement ( motor tic ) noise ( sound tic ) . Tic severity variable : patient mild bearable tic , whereas others tic severe cause bone fracture cervical myelopathy . Diagnostic criterion set Tourette Syndrome Classification Study Group American Psychiatric Association commonly use . It currently recognize TS far common previously think , prevalence 1 10 child adolescent per 1000 . Tics usually treat case disability school , social environment home severe enough warrant medical intervention . TS commonly present co-morbid feature , mainly consist obsessive-compulsive trait , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder depression . Psychopathologic feature partly aftermath tic , particularly patient display severe tic affect social work activity . Therefore , amelioration tic may substantially improve daily life adaptation social work environment . Medication first choice treatment , aim reduce intensity tic associate clinical feature . Different drug , belong several pharmacologic class , α-adrenergic drug , typical atypical neuroleptic , tetrabenazine use . In case drug treatment provide satisfactory symptomatic benefit . Overall , reckon meaningful proportion TS patient adequate benefit drug treatment majority patient side effect variable severity . Ablative psychosurgery historically use treat severe case TS , result disappoint burden irreversible side effect . The recently develop technique deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) allow selectively modulate activity brain structure control movement behavior patient different neurological disorder . This approach warrant patient respond poorly available medical therapy . Recently , therapeutic DBS trial perform patient severe TS , satisfactorily control medication . At first , thalamic nucleus target ablative surgery , particularly centromedian-parafascicular ( CM-pf ) nuclear complex , implanted success . Another anatomical target anterior capsule proximity nucleus accumbens nucleus accumbens , aim interfere tic obsessive-compulsive feature time . More recently , globus pallidus internum ( GPi ) implant . This constitute main output station basal ganglion towards thalamus cerebral cortex . Hypothesis driven rationale 1 . There preliminary evidence subthalamic nucleus another promising target treat motor non-motor feature TS . A clinical observation recently show STN DBS improve motor vocal tic patient consistence Parkinson 's disease TS 2 . Literature evidence show stereotyped behavior nonhuman primate , resemble tic compulsive disorder , relate dysfunction limbic part globus pallidus externum , STN , SN reticulata , rather dysfunction GPi 3 . From physiologic perspective , STN occupy privilege position influence output nuclei basal ganglion , GPi substantia nigra ( SN ) reticulata . Several finding highlight putative role STN integrate emotional , cognitive motor function nucleus would thus effective target treatment condition combine motor symptom , behavioral disorder , obsessive-compulsive disorder 4 . Involvement SN TS also find functional MRI study . Furthermore , stimulation anterior STN effective reduce stereotype primate model behavioral disorder STN DBS PD also result behavioral change . Indeed , small size nucleus may allow modulation abnormal neuronal activity limbic sensorimotor territory , easily GPi thalamic DBS 5 . The small well-defined volume STN combine well standardize implant technique , would lead reduce inter-patient variability target The novelty project The STN may potential target DBS TS . The choice STN target project current model basal ganglia functioning : anatomical location aim modulate sensory-motor , associative limbic subdivision cortico-subcortical-cortical loop think dysfunctional TS . STN DBS may provide quick relief symptom medial thalamic nucleus GPi stimulation . The main objective project evaluate efficacy subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation ( STN DBS ) treat motor phonic tic medically refractory Tourette 's syndrome ( TS ) . Secondary objective individuate standardize best electrical parameter STN stimulation TS , evaluate efficacy safety non-motor TS feature , behavioral abnormality psychiatric disorder , chronic STN stimulation , correlate improvement TS motor non-motor symptom modification brain activity record PET study explore pathophysiology TS , evaluate safety STN DBS TS patient . Clinical evaluation include complete neurological examination ( videotaped tic scale throughout ) , structure psychological interview psychiatric evaluation . Quantitative evaluation perform use appropriate validate neurological ( include Yale Tic Global Severity Scale ( YTGSS ) neuropsychological rating scale , include Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive scale ( Y-BOCS ) , detailed hereafter . Neurological evaluation - Tourette 's motor phonic tic checklist - YTGSS - Global assessment scale ( GAS ) - Global Clinical Impression Scale ( GCI-S ) - Sickness Impact Profile ( SIP ) - Gilles de la Tourette syndrome-quality life scale ( GTS-QOL ) Behavioral evaluation - Y-BOCS - Depression ( MADRS , HAM-D ) - ADHD Anxiety ( ADHD-RS , HAM-A ) Neuropsychological evaluation - Global deterioration - Executive function - Working memory - Fluency Power calculation . A retrospective analysis publish data DBS-treated TS patient report average YGTSS inclusion 50 ±15 point . This keep inclusion criterion YGTSS &gt; 35 . Considering 50 % improvement meaningful , 25-point variation expect baseline post-implant active stimulation group 10 % 5-point variation sham stimulation group . The investigator assume comparable standard deviation baseline end observational period good correlation YGTSS measure ( correlation coefficient : 0.8 ) . An actual number least 5 patient per group allow demonstrate 25-point YGTSS difference two active stimulation sham stimulation group , statistical potency 85 % ( bilateral Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test , alpha = 5 % ) .</detailed_description>
