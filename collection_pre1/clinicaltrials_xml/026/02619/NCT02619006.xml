	<brief_summary>When immediate clamping umbilical cord ( ICC ) occur birth , 20 30 % fetal-placental blood volume leave behind placenta . Preliminary result current study compare effect ICC versus placental transfusion delay cord clamping ( DCC ) show infant DCC high ferritin level 4 month age myelin important region brain . Our objective follow-up study see effect placental transfusion persist three four year age . The investigator plan enroll child participate previous trial ( Infant Brain Study/NCT01620008 ) birth assessment three four year age . Assessments include MRIs neurodevelopmental test examine cognitive , motor , visual , behavioral outcome . The propose research address two central question regard potential benefit DCC brain myelin development child bear healthy term : 1 . Does DCC result increase brain myelin deposition three four year age ? 2 ) Are DCC , iron store , brain myelin content infancy associate improved cognitive , motor , socio-behavioral outcome three four year age ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current obstetrical practice birth United States cut clamp umbilical cord infant immediately birth . When immediate clamping occurs , 20 30 % fetal-placental blood volume leave behind placenta . This blood contain enough iron-rich red blood cell meet infant 's iron need first 4 6 month life . Delaying cord clamp show increase early iron store without contribute adverse outcome . The investigator hypothesize iron sufficiency essential long-term neurologic health . Iron deficiency infancy adversely affect cognitive , motor , socio-emotional , behavioral development . Human animal study show inadequate iron store early infancy irreversible negative impact develop brain deficit persist even iron level restore iron supplementation . Iron essential component myelination critical normal brain development function . Myelination , peak first year life , establish maintains efficient communication discrete region brain . The gap effect increase iron store delay cord clamp myelination long-term neurodevelopment childhood unknown . Our hypothesis placental transfusion affect myelination early childhood neurodevelopment follow way : 1 ) placental transfusion ( delay cord clamp cord milking ) lead increased blood volume ( BV ) red blood cell volume ( RBCV ) birth ; 2 ) increase RBCV result available iron early body iron store ; 3 ) increase body iron store provide essential iron supply optimal brain myelination ; 4 ) optimal myelination result improve cognitive , behavioral socio-emotional performance . The main objective study conduct prospective cohort study follow child enrol previous randomize control trial ( birth 24 month ) know Infant Brain Study . The purpose measure effect cord clamp time structure function develop brain three four year age . The investigator use non-invasive neuroimaging technique measure myelin acquisition time conduct neurodevelopmental assessment correlate finding early iron store long-term developmental outcome .</detailed_description>
