	<brief_summary>aim : 1 . To characterize compensatory balance reaction platform translation stand walk poststroke individual comparison healthy individual . 2 . To explore effect lesion characteristic ( location , size ) patient ' balance reaction . 3 . To explore impact clinical measure unilateral sensory motor impairment , balance , gait fear fall postural reaction stroke subject . 4 . To examine effect perturbation-based balance training balance reaction characteristic post stroke individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characteristics Balance Control Unexpected Loss Balance During Standing Walking Post-stroke Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : Two stage study . Stage 1 - examination , stage 2 - intervention . stage 1 : 60 post-stroke subject recruit rehabilitation unit Loewenstein hospital , Raanana , Israel . 60 healthy age-matched control recruit snowball sampling method physical therapy department match close possible gender BMI.The follow measurement administer : 1 ) Compensatory balance reaction measurement : Compensatory balance reaction measure use BalanceTutor ( MediTouch ) . The BalanceTutor mechatronic device consist computerize treadmill horizontal movable platform operator station . Measurements take two condition : Standing . Subjects instructed stand expose random unexpected platform translation . The platform translation increase systematically control . The increase platform translation adjust examiner subject 's ability recover perturbation . Participants ask respond `` natural '' manner perturbation . Walking . Subjects instruct walk comfortably ( self-paced ) treadmill , expose random unexpected platform translation . The platform translation increase systematically control adjusted examiner subject 's ability recover perturbation . Compensatory balance reaction characteristic ( reaction time , swing time , compensatory step time , step length etc . ) collect three-dimensional motion analysis system . During examination subject wear loose safety harness prevent fall yet allow execution balance recovery reaction . In addition , clinical measure use : Berg Balance Scale , 6 minute walk test , 10 meter walk test , Fugl-Meyer test motor recovery stroke ABC ( Activities-specific Balance Confidence ) scale . Normalized lesion data compute use ABLE module within MEDx software ( Medical Numerics ) . Stage 2 - 60 stroke subject neurology rehabilitation unit Loewenstein hospital randomly allocate one two group : 1 ) perturbation base balance train 2 ) Balance gait training without external perturbation ( control ) . Group 1 - Perturbations base balance training Subjects complete perturbation base balance train stand walk BalanceTutor ( MediTouch ) . Perturbation level individually adjust progress accord subject 's ability . Progression occur increase perturbation level ( increase distance , velocity acceleration ) . At practiced level subject expose random right/left/forward/backward unannounced platform translation stand right/left perturbation ( defined event gait cycle ) walking . In order examine adaptation repeat perturbation , kinematic data collect first session . Group 2 - Balance gait training without external perturbation ( control ) Subjects complete balance training program include voluntary weight shift stand computerized posturography ( NeuroCom ) walking treadmill . Weight shift toward target adjust progress accord subject 's ability . Progression difficulty level occur increase distance target without change base support . At practiced level weight shift conduct right/left/forward/backward direction . In gait part session , subject ask walk prefer treadmill walk speed . Subjects group complete 10-12 training session , 4-5 per week 3 week . Each session last 30 minute include practice stand walk . Subject 's activity document session group . Furthermore , session subject ask rate perceive level challenge 0-10 scale . In addition training session pre- post-intervention measurement stage 1 conduct . In addition , accelerometer place sticker subject 's thigh record 24-48 hour activity . A follow-up measurement conduct 3-6 week post intervention .</detailed_description>
