	<brief_summary>Infections site surgical incision ( SSIs ) common infection among surgical patient . Although patient undergo surgical procedure risk develop SSIs , colorectal surgery consistently high rate SSIs , range 3-45 % . These infection increase length hospital stay , increase rate readmission cost . Further research need study effect mupirocin general surgery . A recent study compare colorectal SSI rate mupirocin standard gauze surgical dressing . The result show mupirocin great effect reduce SSI rate compare standard gauze dressing . However , study perform United States study specific patient population . The purpose study assess rate infection surgical incision colorectal surgery mupirocin dress place versus standard gauze dress without mupirocin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection ( SSIs ) common nosocomial infection among surgical patient third common nosocomial infection among hospitalized patients.1 Although patient undergo surgical procedure risk develop SSIs , colorectal surgery consistently high rate surgical site infection , range 3-45 % . Numerous study show adverse effect SSIs , include increase length hospital stay , morbidity , mortality , readmission cost . In recent study analyze various surgical procedure , include colorectal operation , surgical site infection find number one cause unplanned readmission . Studies perform show intranasal mupirocin may role reduction SSI cardiac orthopedic surgery . However , minimal investigation effect topical mupirocin general surgery . A recent study Spain compare colorectal SSI rate mupirocin dressing , silver-impregnated dressing , standard gauze surgical dressing . The result show mupirocin great effect reduce SSI rate compare standard gauze silver-impregnated dressing . However , study perform United States study open , colorectal oncologic surgery . The aim study compare mupirocin dressing standard surgical dressing respective SSI rate United States community hospital patient undergo elective open minimally invasive colorectal surgery . A single-center prospective , randomize study perform . Patients undergo elective colorectal surgery consent participate randomize ( 1:1 ) one follow 2 treatment group : 1 . Island dressing postoperative day ( POD ) # 2 ( current practice Gundersen Health System ) 2 . Mupirocin + island dress POD # 5 Analysis outcome include rate SSI , 30-day morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
