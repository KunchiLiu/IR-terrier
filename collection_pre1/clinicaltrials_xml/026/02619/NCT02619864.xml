	<brief_title>mTORC1/mTORC2 Kinase Inhibitor AZD2014 Previously Treated Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In phase I &amp; II part study , consent patient receive single agent AZD2014 2 day immediately prior surgery ( PK sample ) fix dose 125 mg bid po ( i.e . day -2 , -1 , morning day 0 [ day surgery ] ) . After recovery surgery , patient , within 7-21 day tumour resection , either start dose escalation part phase I ( within 7-21 day tumour resection ) ( appropriate dose level ) continue phase II phase II open . Patients unable proceed dose escalation part post resection replace . For part study purpose find high dose AZD2014 tolerate without cause severe side effect receive temozolomide therapy see effect study drug participant cancer . This do start dose low one investigator know give safely patient use . Participants give AZD2014 together temozolomide watch closely see side effect make sure side effect severe . If side effect severe , new participant give high dose AZD2014 . Participants join study later get high dos AZD2014 participant join earlier . This continue dose find cause severe temporary side effect . Doses high give . The researcher study also interested look marker help predict patient likely help AZD2014 . For second phase study ( phase II ) , purpose find effect AZD2014 participant glioblastoma , use dos find safe first part study , give temozolomide .</detailed_description>
