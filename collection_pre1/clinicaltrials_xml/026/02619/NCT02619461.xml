	<detailed_description>In summary , exercise induce variety metabolic mechanisms central peripheral level , relate appetite solely gut peptide . The literature point towards rather loose couple come high intensity exercise suppression food intake , without clear explanation cause exercise induce anorexia . This study aim investigate high-intensity exercise effect appetite satiety hormone , inflammation , stress eat behavior appetite food intake . The objective current study investigate factor contribute exercise-induced anorexia lean obese child , maximize translation post-exercise suppression food intake promotion negative energy balance particularly obese child . It hypothesize high-intensity exercise would promote great suppression food intake suppression appetite rating via physiological mechanism depend stress inflammation rather gut peptide .</detailed_description>
