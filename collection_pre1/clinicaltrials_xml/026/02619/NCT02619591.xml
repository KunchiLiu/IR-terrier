	<detailed_description>This randomize , prospective blind study trauma patient arrive emergency department . Study Setting Population This study conduct University Campus University Massachusetts Medical Center , urban academic emergency department see 80,000 patient annually dedicate Level I trauma service staff trauma surgery emergency medicine . Adult patient acute traumatic injury undergo CT scan chest eligible enrollment . Study Protocol Trauma patient enrol arrived emergency department . The investigator include trauma patient age 18 . The investigtors exclude patient unstable require clinical care prevent perform chest wall ultrasound , patient chest tube place prior arrival , pregnant woman , prisoner . Imaging decision trauma patient make early evaluation . The patient assign use pre-determined randomization scheme single view four view hemi-thorax prior image do . Ultrasounds perform interpret credentialed physician use 7.5Mhz linear array transducer portable ultrasound machine ( Zonare z.one ultra ) digital clip record later review . When investigator obtain single view hemi-thorax , probe place longitudinal orientation midclavicular line third intercostal space . When investigator obtain four view hemi-thorax , first image location single view probe move inferiorly laterally obtain additional three image . Immediately follow ultrasound examination , patient transport CT scanner image . The goal study determine single view hemi-thorax identify pneumothorax additional image include . The primary study endpoint presence pneumothorax ultrasound .</detailed_description>
