	<detailed_description>Heart attack condition blood flow heart muscle dangerously low - eventually cause heart muscle die . Drugs improve blood flow , procedure angioplasty , mainstay therapy . They work enough oxygen transport blood . In fact , heart may deprive oxygen heart attack also low blood count ( anemia ) . Anemia , low blood count , may cause bleed condition cancer , kidney failure , chronic infection condition severe arthritis . A transfusion increase delivery oxygen heart muscle . However , know level anemia initiate blood transfusion prevent permanent heart damage . Indeed , low blood count may harmful blood transfusion also carry important risk include extra fluid lung heart inability pump effectively . In previous study , demonstrate give less blood safer patient . But , little evidence patient heart attack . This first pilot trial aim make sure large study answer question doable . The large trial aim determine much blood give minimize damage . In study , divide patient heart attack two group hope prevent patient die . One group receive blood group less blood . In pilot trial , evaluate recruit patient heart attack timely fashion . This trial span 12 month . If patient recruitment go well , move ahead second phase project involve 3500 patient . We plan record number patient die another heart attack well doctor follow treatment plan . The 5-year large scale project provide definitive answer amount optimal timing blood transfusion .</detailed_description>
