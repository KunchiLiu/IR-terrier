	<detailed_description>Hypofibrinogenemia common severe trauma threshold 2.3 g/l associate increased mortality . Although guideline management trauma induce coagulopathy recommend specific time fibrinogen substitution , several paper suggest early substitution might associate improved outcome . Laboratory measurement plasma fibrinogen level , thromboelastometry and/or estimation base base excess , hemoglobin level , Injury Severity Score combination require diagnostic procedure associate certain time delay prolongs time fibrinogen substitution .</detailed_description>
