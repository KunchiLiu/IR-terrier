After complete BEL , participant develop ability reflect situation strategy change everyday life desire direction , feel everyday life satisfactory balance rest work , seclude social activity , etc . The BEL intervention lead occupational therapist . They take part specifically develop two-day education follow BEL manual . They also participate web-based discussion forum seek support researcher and/ BEL occupational therapist . Selection unit participant : Units county council-based psychiatry ( outpatient unit within general psychiatry psychosis care ) community-based activity center ( CBACs ) four county south Sweden invite . Cluster randomization use assign unit BEL control condition . On basis block four unit , two randomize BEL two control condition , care usual ( CAU ) . CAU generally mean standard occupational therapy . Four category participant recruit : ) BEL participant county-council-based psychiatry ; b ) BEL participants community-based psychiatry ; c ) CAU participants county-council-based psychiatry ; ) CAU participants community-based psychiatry .

Subsequently , BEL implement unit randomise condition . After 16 week intervention ( include booster session ) , measurement repeat . A follow-up made another six month . The data collection make corresponding time point comparison unit . Additional qualitative interview make intervention unit , strategically select participant ( attendees staff ) get deep picture intervention process implication . When research project finish , comparison unit give opportunity go intervention .

The sample size also allow comparison community-based county-council-based BEL . Since measure characteristic CBACs relevance county council-based psychiatry , comparison unit level concern community-based psychiatry . Analyses qualitative interview , mean grounded theory [ 10 ] , yield detailed description BEL implication , perceive attendees staff . Current state study : The project initial phase first unit recruit late 2012 . At present , 24 unit randomize either condition . The second measurement ( complete BEL ) complete follow-ups continue mid-2016 , qualitative interview . Analysing data reporting result continue late 2018 . Methodological consideration By include 60 participant group study able detect medium effect size ( ES=0.4 ) , would difference clinical practical significance . Self-rating instrument use important consider whether produce reliable data use people SMI , particularly since many target group cognitive problem . However , research show self-ratings psychological factor valid reliable among people schizophrenia , also poor insight mental illness . Age , gender foreign origin consider covariates , along socioeconomic factor family situation , educational level money one 's disposal . Other factor consider participant 's functional status diagnosis . Research show diagnosis per se play substantial role outcome psychiatric rehabilitation , course psychiatric disability people perceive everyday occupation , investigate evidence inconclusive . Level functioning , level psychopathology , negative symptom indeed show importance outcome psychiatric rehabilitation . Therefore , project also control factor related diagnosis functional status .</detailed_description>
