	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Adoptive Transfer With Autologous NKT Cells Metastatic Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considerable progress immunotherapy metastatic melanoma make past 5 year , approval immune checkpoint-blocking antibody . NKT cell potent immunoregulatory cell population heavily implicate promote immunity infection cancer . And new generation amplification method , 1,000 fold amplification NKT cell obtain , NKT cell base adoptive cell transfer available might show efficacy melanoma . Investigators conduct open label , dose escalation , phase I clinical trial explore maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) intravenous administration autologous NKT Cells metastatic melanoma patient .</detailed_description>
