	<brief_title>The Effect Backward Walking Treadmill Training Balance Patient With Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Walking train good method strategy improve postural stability , balance , gait symmetry , increase walk ability . Generally , many walk train theory method patient chronic stroke treadmill walk training apply recent year . Previous study show patient stroke improve walk ability speed walk treadmill train . However , study demonstrate forward walk treadmill train improved balance walk ability patient stroke , few study investigate effect backward walk treadmill train . However , study date investigate effect backward walk treadmill train patient chronic stroke .</detailed_description>
