	<brief_title>Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension Sachet 4-hour Esophageal pH Study GERD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-centre , randomised , open-label , placebo-controlled , two-period crossover study . After sign write informed consent ( ICF ) , patient undergo screen period 10 day ( Visit 1 ) require patient return clinic several occasion . At start screen process patient 24 hour ( h ) pH monitor include one standardised refluxogenic meal 4 h fast . The 24 h pH monitoring result use key criterion patient eligibility provide patient diagnostic information symptom . After 24 h pH monitoring , eligible patient supply Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachet take require symptom relief visit ( 2×10ml sachet four time daily : 30 minute breakfast , 30 minute lunch , 30 minute dinner immediately lie bed , stop dose least 24 hour prior Visit 2 ) . Patients satisfy study entry requirement within 10 day consent , randomise receive either two Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachet ( 2×10ml ) two placebo sachet ( 2×10ml ) follow placement pH electrode 4 h fast standardise refluxogenic meal Visit 2 . Upon completion Visit 2 4-hour post-dose pH monitoring period patient re-supplied Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachet take require symptom relief ( 2×10ml sachet four time daily : 30 minute breakfast , 30 minute lunch , 30 minute dinner immediately lie bed , stop dose least 24 hour prior Visit 3 ) 7 ± 2 day . Patients return Visit 3 7 ± 2 day . Visit 3 consist repeat pH catheter insertion ( 4 hour fast follow refluxogenic test meal consumption ) pH monitoring , receive alternative randomise treatment Visit 3 .</detailed_description>
