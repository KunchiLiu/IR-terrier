	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study SBI , colesevelam , placebo patient undergo autologous HSCT clinical care multiple myeloma . The number adult undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) grow significantly past two decade result availability therapy advance hematologic solid tumor malignancy , broad selection criterion eligibility receive transplant . Generally , stem cell transplant procedure consist administration chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy ablate residual malignancy ( call conditioning therapy ) , follow intravenous infusion hematopoietic stem cell restore bone marrow function . Generally , HSCT positive effect survival , despite serious adverse effect life-threatening complication . Diarrhea affect 91 % patient receive autologous allogeneic HSCT identify 9 % patient single debilitate adverse effect post-HSCT . Other commonly encounter symptom nausea vomit ( 13 % ) mouth sore ( 42 % ) . The impact diarrhea significant result dehydration , negative impact quality life , prolonged hospitalization increase cost risk , diarrhea may potentially life-threatening .</detailed_description>
