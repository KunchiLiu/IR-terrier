	<brief_title>Piperacllin Versus Placebo Patients Undergoing Surgery Acute Cholecystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Inflammation gallbladder due obstruction gallstone ( acute cholecystitis ) common condition one common indication laparoscopic cholecystectomy . In case , procedure may perform without great risk severe complication . In case , however , congest bile gallbladder may become infected . In clinical routine , acute cholecystitis often manage infectious condition , despite fact previous study show bile case acute cholecystitis sterile . On hand , antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce risk surgical site infection case manifest bacterial contamination , perhaps , also reduce risk contamination . There firm evidence support acute surgery , prefereably laparoscopic cholecystectomy , benefit antibiotic treatment full evaluate . Previous study show benefit antibiotic prophylaxis limit case laparoscopic cholecystectomy uncomplicated gallstone disease . There , however , study assess antibiotic prophylaxis surgery acute cholecystitis . The aim present study assess benefit antibiotic prophylaxis patient undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy acute cholecystitis . Methods The study base patient admit acute cholecystitis department acute surgery , Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge . In case patient fulfill inclusion critera suitable laparoscopic surgery , write oral information study give . In case agree participate study , treatment allocation determine seal envelope system . The patient randomise receive either Piperacillin 4g x 3 iv preoperatively prophylaxis placebo ( saline infusion ) . The study double-blind . Piperacillin/placebo administrate research nurse allocation . The infusion cover bag order maintain blinding . Neither surgeon performing procedure , patient staff care patient inform allocation . The procedure perform within 24 day inclusion . Administration Piperacillin/placebo start immediately inclusion continue procedure complete . If categorical indication antibiotic treatment occur surgery , allocate infusion remove patient give antibiotic decide surgeon . In case , patient stay study analyse accord intention treat . During laparoscopic cholecystectomy , least 10 cc bile aspirate sterile condition fundus gallbladder long needle start peritoneum dissection . The bile send aerobic anaerobic culture . Bacteria identify use standard laboratory procedure . Sample size estimation If incidence positive culture 50 % placebo group reduce 25 % antibiotic prophylaxis give , 36 patient arm would require order reach 80 % chance detect difference p &lt; 0.05 level significance ( one side test ) . A total sample 100 patient thus sufficient test primary outcome measure . Follow-up Samples CRP , interleukins , bilirubin , AST , ALT ALP take daily peroperative day postoperative day 2 . Quality life assess SF-36 preoperatively . Level pain estimate base MacGill Pain Questionnaire day procedure postoperative day 2 . One month postoperatively , patient invite follow-up . At follow-up , SF-36 fill .</detailed_description>
