	<brief_summary>In current constantly change healthcare landscape quality measurement central role . As practice medicine shift authority accountability , quality surgical intervention continuous scrutiny patient , peer , payer , policy maker . If do appropriately quality measurement empower member healthcare debate . There increase focus patient satisfaction outcome quality indicator . An important part surgical outcomes patient 's perception result intervention overall experience preoperative setting . When assess surgical outcome , measure patient satisfaction necessary . A qualitative systematic review patient satisfaction measure note scarcity well-development quality improvement initiative improve patient satisfaction . Anxiety , potent behavioral psychological reaction , weigh heavily patient 's perioperative experience exacerbate preoperative concern underlie disease impend anesthesia surgery . There multiple stressor day surgery : unfamiliar environment , multiple form sign , multiple short encounter new unfamiliar personnel . These create confusion , increase baseline anxiety , negatively affect patient experience , extension surgical outcome . Increasing familiarity environment help patient feel informed matter , accurate expectation possible benefit harm option . This potentially decrease overall anxiety , improve patient satisfaction , decrease pain level . With current study investigator follow two specific aim : Aim 1 . To determine whether immersive preoperative experience ( video ) associate decreased anxiety improve patient experience perioperative phase . Aim 2 . To determine whether immersive preoperative experience associate decreased stress , improve patient satisfaction , decrease pain perioperative phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study include patient schedule undergo neurosurgical intervention . Patients surgical intervention deem necessary approached participation study . After sign informed consent , randomize watch video preoperative evaluation visit regular standard care evaluation preoperative visit . For patient randomize intervention group , preoperative visit perform , would normally , addition 5-minute video . Patients give minute watch video , chance ask question . The remainder interaction patient provider affect way . The video include simulate patient encounter ( actor real patient ) showcasing preoperative experience patient , include get check , meeting nurse , surgeon , anesthesiologist . The technology use allow immersion patient preoperative environment . The hypothesis introduce way familiarize patient preoperative environment , investigator impact anxiety operation satisfaction entire experience . Investigators hope quality improvement initiative change patient experience well . Patients fill questionnaire immediately preoperatively day procedure , day procedure , 30-days operation ( patient undergo surgery degenerative spine disease ) . The outcomes interest stress level , pain level , patient satisfaction level . Preoperative , intraoperative , postoperative variable analyze use χ2 test categorical variable nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test continuous variable . Logistic regression perform , binary outcome . Linear regression perform , continuous outcome . The variable age test separately continuous variable categorical variable ( 65-69 year , 70-74 year , 75-79 year , ≥80 year ) multivariable logistic regression model . Other variable include multivariable model include Charlson Comorbidity Index score , American Society Anesthesiologists [ ASA ] score , APAIS score . Mixed effect method use , treat physician random effect variable , account cluster physician level . Investigators intend randomize 150 patient 1:1 allocation video conventional arm . We anticipate able obtain primary outcome 10 % patient , leave 135 , approximately 68 completers per arm . This yield 80 % power usual 5 % type 1 error rate detect difference two arm one half ( 0.5 ) standard deviation primary outcome .</detailed_description>
