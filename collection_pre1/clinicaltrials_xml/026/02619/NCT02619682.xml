	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study safety alternate ixazomib citrate lenalidomide treatment help keep cancer come back stem cell transplant ( maintenance therapy ) treat patient multiple myeloma . Ixazomib citrate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Lenalidomide may stimulate immune system attack cancer cell . Giving ixazomib citrate lenalidomide maintenance therapy transplant may prolong length time cancer return .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternating Ixazomib Citrate Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy After Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate toxicity use ixazomib ( ixazomib citrate ) lenalidomide maintenance therapy autologous transplant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate ability deliver plan therapy . II . Assess initial response therapy . III . Evaluate median time disease progression . IV . Assess overall survival . OUTLINE : Within 30-120 day completion autologous transplant , patient receive ixazomib citrate orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 15 every 28 day 2 course , follow lenalidomide PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 2 course . Treatment repeat , alternate every 2 course , 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
