	<detailed_description>Introduction : Tailored Breast Screening Trial ( TBST ) population-based , non-inferiority randomised trial aim evaluating impact change screen protocol service screen practice . `` Tailored '' mean use breast density classification allocate woman longer interval , decrease number screen round 45-50-year age range . Density breast baseline consider indicator risk also mask factor . The aim study assess impact longer interval reduction side effect woman allocate intervention group . In study , intervention offer high-density woman followed-up accord usual care interval , since study aim decrease screen burden . Methods 44- 45 year old woman resident screen centre catchment area invite attend mammography screen ask informed consent order include study . After enrolment , receive high quality digital mammography ; two view breast density classify accord BI-RADS classification . Women randomly allocate either usual care group intervention group . In intervention group , woman dense breast ( 3-4 category BI-RADS ) invite 1 year , lower-density group intervention arm invite 2 year . After age 50 , woman continue screen usual service screen programme . Density breast read 2 reader , controversy solve consensus . Allocation woman blind mammography reader . EXPECTED RESULTS : outcome : 1. cumulative incidence interval-cancer case intention treat group density group , aim assess non inferiority screen performance ; 2. cumulative incidence T2+/node-positive status breast cancer case arm protocol . Screening performance parameter evaluate screen round . Interim outcome analysis expect 3 6 year average follow-up , respectively , start begin screen . SAMPLE SIZE : non-inferiority limit derive accepted level interval cancer woman 50-69 year , consider acceptable European Community Guidelines . Assuming 70 % BI-RADS 1-2 baseline basis digital mammography experience , estimate sample size power 90 % 16,596 woman per arm .</detailed_description>
