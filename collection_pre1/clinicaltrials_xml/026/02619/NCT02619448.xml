	<brief_summary>The standard treatment patient NSCLC ( non-small cell lung cancer ) clinically negative lymph node remain surgery per current guideline . Five year survival patient stage I non-small cell lung cancer generally great 50 % surgery . Many patient heart lung issue disease keep undergo curative surgery . Studies show majority patient die cancer disease . This reason treat early stage lung cancer patient definitive therapy , surgery . This study enroll twelve subject evaluate side effect treatment , decide good option patient surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemotherapy Accelerated Hypofractionated Radiation Medically Inoperable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer relate death men woman United States . In 2014 estimate number new lung cancer case United States 224,210 . Approximately 159,260 people estimate die lung cancer 2014 . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) constitute 80 % lung cancer case . The standard treatment patient NSCLC clinically negative lymph node remain surgery per NCCN guideline . Five year survival patient stage I non-small cell lung cancer generally great 50 % surgical resection lobectomy . A significant number patient cardio-pulmonary co-morbidities preclude undergoing curative surgery . Studies show majority patient die cancer co-morbidities . This form rationale treat medically inoperable early stage lung cancer patient definitive therapy . Treatment radiotherapy ( RT ) standard option patient unable undergo surgery . Radiation alone lead slightly well outcome still equivalent surgery 60-70 % local failure conventional fractionate radiotherapy several week . The development three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3DCRT ) allow focused treatment avoid nearby normal tissue result improved disease specific survival overall survival still poor . There currently data support use chemotherapy medically inoperable group either adjuvant setting concurrently RT early stage lung cancer . In patient unresectable Stage IIIA IIIB NSCLC , combine chemo-RT proven superior RT alone . Two randomized study compare concurrent versus sequential chemo-radiotherapy find concurrent approach provide superior outcome . However approach study early stage lung cancer medically inoperable group . The medically inoperable patient cohort often undergo surgical staging , increase odds harbor occult regional disease . Chemotherapy give concurrently radiation act radiosensitizer improve local disease control could decrease rate distant metastasis . It possible medically inoperable population also experience side effect due co-morbidities poor performance status . Hence need determine concurrent chemoradiation feasible tolerable medically inoperable patient . The main side effect associate concurrent chemoradiation stage III NSCLC esophagitis . This arise due effect radiation therapy regional lymph node ( LN ) . The investigator ' study population early stage lung cancer nodal involvement . Hence , investigator anticipate esophagitis major side effect researcher ' study . There recent data adjuvant chemotherapy medically operable group . Data Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation ( LACE ) show median follow-up time 5.2 year , overall HR death 0.89 ( 95 % CI , 0.82 0.96 ; P = .005 ) , correspond 5-year absolute benefit 5.4 % chemotherapy . A similar trial evaluate role sequential chemotherapy SBRT medically inoperable population attempt investigator ' institution close due poor accrual . Hence , investigator look role concurrent chemo-RT population .</detailed_description>
