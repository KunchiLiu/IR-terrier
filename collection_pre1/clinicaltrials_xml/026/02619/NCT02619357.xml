	<brief_summary>The prevalence , low cost , low burden wearable device provide quantitative qualitative feedback subject 's activity level present opportunity use device clinical observational study . However , accuracy reproducibility give device may vary device design algorithm implementation . Therefore , validation emerge technology know standard analysis exhale breath currently available medical device critical . This single center , two-cohort , single period , open-label , methodology study . No investigational product use study . Eligible subject wear 2 generation SenseWear Armband device , 2 ActiGraph GT9x device ( one wrist one waist ) Garmin Vivofit 2 activity tracker wristband 24 hour per day . Subjects consent participate optional sub-study wear SOMNOwatch Plus EEG-6 device sleep . Subjects perform variety laboratory field-based exercise test strength exercise use Latex-Free Therabands.The co-primary objective study firstly compare outputs test device ( SenseWear Armband Gecko Actigraph GT9x ) SenseWear Armband MF secondly assess sensitivity accuracy test device subject COPD asthma perform laboratory-based exercise testing .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cohort 1 ( COPD ) &gt; =45 year &lt; =70 year Cohort 2 ( Asthma ) &gt; =18 year &lt; =70 year . Cohort 1 ; subject confirm diagnosis COPD ( Gold stage 2 3 , COPD patient classify accord Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [ GOLD ] Guidelines ) define postbronchodilator spirometry FEV1 &gt; =40 % &lt; 80 % predict , FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 Cohort 2 ; subject document , physiciandiagnosed asthma . BMI within range 19 32 kilogram ( kg ) /m^2 ( inclusive ) Male female ; A female childbearing potential eligible enter participate study negative pregnancy test screen day 1 . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Alpha1antitrypsin deficiency : Subjects diagnosis alpha1antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD , know . Other respiratory disorder : Subjects tuberculosis , lung cancer , significant bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease active pulmonary disease . Pneumonia respiratory tract infection resolve least 14 day prior screen . In addition , subject experience pneumonia period screen visit study visit exclude . COPD asthma exacerbation ( case define change symptom require increased dos current medicine prescription new medicine , e.g. , corticosteroid antibiotic ) resolve least 28 day prior screen . COPD asthma exacerbation period screen visit study visit exclude . Presence severe and/or poorly control asthma opinion investigator render participation study unsafe Any comorbid medical condition opinion investigator would make participation study unsafe unfeasible , include condition prohibit completion exercise testing : orthopaedic , neurological , cardiovascular complaint significantly impair normal biomechanical movement pattern limit ability walk/cycle judge investigator . Resting oxyhemoglobin saturation &lt; 94 % . Use supplemental oxygen therapy day night . Drug/alcohol abuse : Subjects know suspected history alcohol ( male &gt; 21 unit per week female &gt; 14 unit per week ) drug abuse within last 2 year . One unit equivalent 8 gram ( g ) alcohol : halfpint ( ~240 milliliter [ mL ] ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine 1 ( 25 mL ) measure spirit . Inability abstain smoke period subject admit Clinical Unit . A history allergy hypersensitivity metal , particularly stainless steel . Clinically significant abnormality electrocardiogram ( ECG ) determine investigator . Any vital sign indicator , e.g. , hypertension tachycardia rest discretion investigator would make participation study unsafe unfeasible .</criteria>
