	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To assess safety tolerability pembrolizumab combination vorinostat patient advance renal urothelial cell carcinoma order select recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) To evaluate overall safety profile pembrolizumab combination vorinostat ; ( 2 ) To assess anti-tumor activity ( i.e . objective response rate , progression-free survival ) pembrolizumab combination vorinostat patient advanced renal urothelial cell carcinoma ; ( 3 ) To characterize PD-L1/2 , immune cell subset , miRs tumor and/or blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/Ib Study Pembrolizumab With Vorinostat Patients With Advanced Renal Urothelial Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/Ib , open-label , safety , pharmacodynamics study pembrolizumab combination vorinostat patient advance renal urothelial cell carcinoma . This clinical study compose Dose Finding Phase Expansion Phase . The Dose Finding Phase estimate Recommended Phase II Dose ( RP2D ) patient advance renal urothelial cell carcinoma patient . The Dose Finding Phase lead identification Expansion Test Dose pembrolizumab combination vorinostat . The Expansion Test Dose Recommended Phase II Dose ( RP2D ) ( i.e . high test dose declare safe tolerable Investigators Sponsor ) . Patients treat oral vorinostat every day 14 day , pembrolizumab fix dose 200 mg IV . Each cycle every 21 day . Two dose level vorinostat test 2-patient cohort accord 3 + 3 standard design ( 100 mg 200 mg ) . 200 mg dose represent 50 % recommend vorinostat dose single agent . For Dose Finding Phase ( Combination Phase ) , start dose level vorinostat 100 mg mouth ( PO ) every day 14 day , 7 day break . The first dose level minimum 3 patient treat ( unless first 2 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) 3rd patient enrol ) . Once RP2D identify , Dose Expansion Phase open . During Dose Expansion Phase , study run-in phase sequential single-agents combination phase . The reason run-in phase dose expansion obtain data immunomodulatory effect vorinostat separately pembrolizumab . Thirty patient prior treatment enrol two expansion cohort : 15 anti-PD1 naive patient 15 anti-PD1 resistant patient ( defined patient transient clinical response without clinical response prior immune-checkpoint inhibition ) .</detailed_description>
