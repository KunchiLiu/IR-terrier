	<brief_title>The Oral Microbiota Reservoir Systemic Opportunistic Pathogens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) exacerbation Helicobacter pylorus infect gastric ulcer cause pain discomfort , healthcare resource increase usage antibiotic . COPD gastric ulcer two thing common - ( ) infect via oropharyngeal tissue ( ii ) antibiotic include treatment regimen diseases . This proposal suggest oral microbiome , particularly dental plaque , plausible source reinfection COPD gastric ulcer . The rational concentration antibiotic need inhibit growth bacteria within dental biofilm estimate 250 time great planktonically grow bacteria , hence antibiotic use eradicate disease leave behind opportunistic pathogen dental plaque able re-infect stomach lung . There small study ( n ≈ 20 ) indicate add advanced dental cleaning establish respective treatment regimen COPD gastric ulcer low risk reinfection recurrence H. pylorus infection well COPD , large conclusive randomize study need . Aim The overall aim project investigate treatment H. pylorus infection lung exacerbation optimize add advanced dental cleaning establish antibiotic treatment regime thereby eliminate source reinfections . A . To investigate add advanced dental cleaning H. pylorus eradication low risk gastric H. pylorus recolonization , reinfection affect gastric symptom . - To analyze add advanced dental cleaning H. pylori eradication generates different oral microbiota compare establish eradication treatment . B . To investigate add advanced dental cleaning COPD exacerbation treatment low number exacerbation come 6 , 12 24 month . - To analyze add advanced dental cleaning COPD treatment regime generate different oral microbiota compare COPD exacerbation treatment . A . Project description H. pylorus project At Department Gastroenterology The H. pylorus project conduct Örebro Malmö . In Örebro collaboration Jonas Halfvarsson Lakis Vravossinos Department Gastroenterology , University Hospital Örebro , dental specialist clinic Örebro . In Malmö collaboration Ervin Toth Department Gastroenterology Skane University hospital Folktandvarden Skane dental clinic Skane university hospital ( sjukhustandvarden ) . Both patient gastric well duodenal ulcer two biopsy take diseased site test presence ( ) H. pylorus use Campylobacter-like organism test ( CLO-test ) ( ii ) clarithromycin resistance . Any patient generally healthy , gastric ulcer ( gastric duodenal ) H. pylori test ask participate study nurse clinic . If agree participate , consent form fill . The patient hand saliva collection tube DNA GenoTek , ask spit start medication eradication also ask bring saliva tube come dental office . The information brochure recruit subject hand include phone number dental office allow make appointment . However , end day nurse Endoscopy Department inform dental clinic patient sign consent day . COPD project At lung clinic The COPD project conduct Region Skane lung clinic collaboration COPD clinic Ystad ( Region Skane collaboration Dr. Hanan Tanash ) Folktandvarden Skane two correspond dental clinic , one Ystad one Malmö experience dental hygienist . In Örebro subject recruit lung clinic collaboration Dr. Josefin Sundh dental cleaning perform dental specialist clinic , folktandvarden Örebro . When patient contact COPD team due COPD exacerbation classify moderate severe COPD ( Gold stage II IV ) inform current study nurse . The patient ask sign consent hand write information include number dental clinic . The patient also hand GenoTek tube saliva collection inform spit start medication bring dental clinic . Subjects agree participate study also give appointment physiotherapist sputum mobilization collect Omnigene-SPUTUM tube DNA GenoTek . H. pylorus project COPD project intervention At dental clinic The dental clinic receives phone call person sign consent ; alternatively , nurse dental clinic call patient . At dental clinic patient randomize , either advanced dental cleaning group , dental treatment group dentist dental clinic . When patient come dental visit , group undergo periodontal examination microbiological sampling . Questionnaire - Upon arrive dental clinic , participant ask fill questionnaire include medical history validate question gastrointestinaldisease [ 13 ] . The microbiological sampling do collect GenoTek tube subject spit start medication , well sample dental plaque sample . Periodontal examination perform 6 site per tooth include third molar . Periodontal pocket ≥ 4mm register well bleed upon probe , plaque index attachment loss . Intervention - The oral biofilm disrupt remove sub- well supragingival surface teeth . Supragingival surface clean use prophylactic paste RDA 250 supplement curette ultrasonic debridement . Subgingival surface clean use curette ultrasonic debridement indicate base periodontal examination . The tongue clean use tongue scraper . Finally , patient ask rinse 10 ml 2 mg/ml chlorhexidine mouth rinse one minute . Follow H. pylorus project The subject follow 12 month . The subject visit dental clinic new microbiological sampling ( saliva sample index teeth plaque ) well UTB test check recolonization . The subject also hand fecal sampling tube envelope H. pylori antibody test . The participant also ask fill questionnaire , include change general health , usage antibiotic reason validate form evaluate gastrointestinal symptom [ 13 ] note recurrence gastric ulcer . If able recruit specific person 12 month follow-up check medical record recurrence gastric ulcer . Follow COPD project After 12 month participant call ask many exacerbation need medical attention since join study , double check medical record . They also ask take antibiotic reason change medication way . They give appointment COPD team sputum mobilization collection saliva use DNA GenoTek 's tube . Microbiological analysis The subsequent microbiological analysis execute use deep sequencing , well qPCR . Time schedule 2016-2017 - Participants recruit , randomized treatment group treat . 2017-2018 - Participants follow . 2018-2019 - Data analysis publication . Network Daniel Jönsson - PhD 2007 postdoc systemic effect periodontal disease 2009 2010 Columbia University , New York , NY , USA . Became specialist periodontics 2014 currently position Malmö University Region Skane , Lund . Dr. Jönsson start part time position Örebro 2016 . Bodil Ohlsson - Professor specialist Internal Medicine Gastroenterology Lund University Region Skane University hospital . Hanan Tanash - PhD specialist Internal Medicine . Field interest - COPD . Ervin Toth - PhD specialist Internal Medicine . Field interest - GI-diseases . Jonas Halfvarsson - Associate Professor Örebro University hospital . Field interest - GI-diseases . Josefin Sundh - Associate Professor Örebro University hospital . Field interest - COPD . Frida Fak - Associate Professor Lund University . Field interest - microbiology . Folktandvarden Skane - two dental hygienist recruit project . Folktandvarden Örebro - post-graduate student recruit dental cleaning well manage logistics project . Daniel Jönsson supervisor student . Power analysis The COPD study superiority power analysis base pilot study Kucukoskun et al . [ 3 ] . Based data 80 % power detect difference 1.3 exacerbation per year sample 105 subject group p-value &lt; 0.05 . For H. pylorus study power analysis binary subject either get re-infected relapse symptom . Because pilot study Zaric et al [ 2 ] conduct Serbia clarithromycin resistance much common , consequently successful eradication less frequent Sweden , base current study result . Therefore , proper power analysis generate first 50 subject ( 25 vs 25 ) recruit . Significance Given study show additional dental cleaning impact reinfection gastric ulcer COPD imply dental clean subsidized treating disease . This would significant impact restrict antibiotic resistance H. pylorus infection COPD treat antibiotic . Both disease also cause personal suffering consequently disable person work , cause financial consequence , course healthcare expense .</detailed_description>
