	<brief_title>Risk Stratification Acute Care : The Meaning suPAR Measurement Triage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In health care system general population growing , patient live chronic condition hospital reduce bed length stay , crucial perform safe fast risk stratification patient present Emergency department . Risk stratification currently perform combination measurement vital sign assessment primary complaint . The aim current study ass whether supplement biomarkers improve risk stratification regard mortality , readmission improve overall patient flow Emergency department . Soluble urokinase plasminogen activate receptor ( suPAR ) soluble form urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor ( uPAR ) . uPAR present various immunological active cell , well endothelia smooth muscle cell . It believe suPAR mirror inflammatory response patient . Previous study show strong association mortality severity disease broad variety condition ( infection , hepatic- , renal- , cardiac- lung disease ) well possible marker disease development general population . These ability indicate suPAR although unspecific would ideal identify patient high- low-risk . The aim target intervention limit clinical focus beneficial . In unselected patient suPAR one strong prognostic biomarker available date . It know whether information prognosis Emergency department use prevent death , serious complication reduce admission readmission . The purpose current study examine introduction biomarker suPAR education doctor mean suPAR level association disease , reduce mortality , admission readmission patient refer emergency room .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients present acutely Acute ward/Emergency department blood sample do include Hemoglobin , C reactive protein Creatinine within 6 hour registration within study period . The study carry 2 Hospitals Capital Denmark . Patients present Pediatric , Gynecological Obstetric unit . Patients examine blood sample .</criteria>
