The study conduct 54-months six community , another six community similar status serve control sit . During Phases 1-3 , survey maternal health service utilization carry baseline , midterm completion point project .

	<detailed_description>Intervention Design : This intervention randomize cluster trial design : intervention implement 6 health wards/communities ( 4 rural/peri-urban 2 urban ) 6 health wards/communities similar socio-demographic characteristic serve control ( intervention implement ) . Including urban peri-urban cluster enable one capture rural urban data attitude toward PMC maternal care ( Phase 1 ) , efficacy intervention increase PMC use ( Phase 2 ) . It also enable one see attitude ( Phase 1 data ) intervention ( Phase 2 ) different rural vs. urban setting . This would describe secondary analysis main data derive Phase 1 Phase 2 . The Intervention : The actual intervention activity apply finalize intervention workshop , follow Phase 1 . However , base current knowledge , intervention need multi-faceted , possibly consist 1 ) provision incentive encourage woman attend primary health care use family planning , antenatal , delivery postnatal service ; 2 ) conditional cash transfer promote uptake service ; 3 ) target community health education advocacy activity ; 4 ) community maternal audit/accountability activity , community-led activity aim promote utilization service ; 5 ) outreach service PHCs ; 6 ) PHC strengthen include train health provider ; 7 ) training kitting community health ranger train follow woman home ensure default continue use PHC service delivery . Control Group : The control group comprise woman eligible give birth ( include case fetal infant death ) intervention period comparative health ward , receive intervention continue receive usual pattern utilization maternity care . To ensure comparability social , economic cultural factor intervention control group , health ward serve control select States intervention health ward . Hence , study pair intervention-control group States , distance enough one another ( separate LGAs ) reduce potential effect study contamination ( i.e. , intervention know adopt control region ) . However , intervention prove effective , investigator recommend use intervention activity control sit , well throughout country .</detailed_description>
