	<brief_summary>This comprehensive genomic analysis biospecimen repository study incorporate Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) archival tumor tissue 200 subject metastatic urothelial cancer support several parallel goal . The immediate goal involve generation comprehensive report identify subject specific genetic mutation and/or alteration base NGS . Once NGS complete , DNA RNA extract specimen remain blocks/slides/curls store future research . Long-term , goal endeavor support collaborative translational research project metastatic urothelial cancer allow investigator interrogate abstract coded clinical data link data biospecimen study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . STUDY PLAN : SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION AND CONSENT : Sites may approach subject attend appointment evaluation metastatic urothelial cancer inclusion . Study staff review consent document potential subject answer question . A subject allow delay enrollment study inform ask question enroll later date . BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PROCESSING : When subject consent entry study , consent access archival tumor tissue ( whether primary metastatic site ) genetic analysis . Further , subject consent indefinite use specimens link clinical information ongoing future biomedical research . Additionally , sit inform subject consent process researcher may use information genetic research include research somatic germline mutation . Analyses perform cod ( de-identified ) data/specimens Collection Archived Tumor Samples : - After subject consent , sit request primary and/or metastatic archive tumor tissue . At least 60μm tissue least 20 % tumor content need analysis . Ideally , tissue submit contain ≥ 40 % tumor content . Sites send tissue directly Paradigm . - Sites also request correspond pathology report ( ) . Each institution use standard operate procedure preparation FFPE material . Each participate site ship specimen access GU15-217 directly Paradigm . Collection Blood Research Purposes Only : - Whole blood research purpose ( include germline analysis ) collect subject . Any DNA analysis blood research purpose perform cod ( de-identified ) sample . Blood sample collect UC-GENOME ship participate site BCAN Biobank HCRN . PARADIGM TESTING : Upon receipt tumor specimen enrol subject , Paradigm enrich sample tumor via Laser Capture Enrichment ( LCE ) , proprietary high throughput process , require , prior isolation DNA RNA . Paradigm perform comprehensive DNA analysis ( include mutation , gene fusion , copy number variation ) via Paradigm Cancer Diagnostic ( PCDx ) test . Report Generation : - Following NGS analysis , Paradigm generate subject specific report include summary genomic alteration highlight variation consider potentially actionable , concise discussion molecular analysis Paradigm pathologists oncologist well BCGC expert panel , list potential clinical trial incorporate relevant targeted agent , potential therapeutic option base specific alteration discover along associated level evidence . The BCGC expert panel work Paradigm ensure potential clinical trial represent individual subject report . Storage Future Research : - The BCAN Biobank Hoosier Cancer Research Network ( HCRN ) store DNA RNA isolate study , biospecimens remain isolation , future biomedical research . If point subject wish withdraw study , HCRN destroy specimen may link subject . We unable stop use specimen strip identify information link identify information . COMMUNICATION OF NGS RESULTS TO PROVIDER AND SUBJECT : After test PCDx complete , Paradigm provide subject specific report subject 's treating physician ( typically 4-5 business day receipt tumor tissue ) HCRN . During informed consent process , sit inform subject physician communicate result genetic test tumor specimen . Along result communicate , subject ' treat physician explain implication test result , include whether genetic profile render potentially eligible specific therapy clinical trial . Sites also inform subject researcher store specimen remain genetic profile tumor complete . Storage continue indefinitely future biomedical research . This may include development commercial product specimen . Sites must explain subject although blood sample obtain , study aim discover germline mutation . Sites must emphasize genetic analysis perform within study construe genetic test genetic mutation associate hereditary cancer susceptibility . Nevertheless , NGS may perform blood , possible germline mutation predisposes subject cancer incidentally discover . Subjects receive information mutation , however , analysis perform de-identified sample . ABSTRACTION OF MEDICAL RECORDS : Research staff site abstract clinical information subject enters information web base clinical research platform , OnCore® . Data abstract include detail follow : demographic , cancer diagnosis , cancer stage , surgical medical management , treatment decision make response NGS result communicate physician response/longer term outcome data result treatment decision . ACCESS TO DATA/SPECIMENS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH : The database link cod clinical genetic data , create biospecimen data repository . These data , along biospecimens store HCRN , ultimately available researcher BCGC-approved IRB-approved study allow access data/specimens , HCRN manage data , protect confidentiality study subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow applicable inclusion criterion participate study : IRBapproved write informed consent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act 1996 ( HIPAA ) authorization release personal health information ; NOTE : HIPAA authorization may include informed consent obtain separately . Age ≥ 18 year time consent . Histologically cytologically confirm urothelial cancer bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis . Metastatic urothelial cancer define M1 ( distant metastatic disease ) and/or N3 ( nodes outside true pelvis ) time enrollment . Tumor tissue available suitable molecular analysis least one follow source : Tissue previously store enrol institution Tissue previously store outside institution ( enrol institution ) Available tumor tissue must FFPE block minimum tumor content 20 % ( optimally ≥ 40 % ) . To best meet tumor content requirement , FFPE block contain 75mm tissue . The tissue specimen may come blocks/slides/curls access UCGENOME enrolled subject . NOTE : Prior trial registration , tumor content confirm central pathology review Paradigm ( Next Generation Sequencing Company ) . If tissue submit meet tumor cellularity requirement , additional tissue request . If tissue submit available , subject ineligible participate . Willing provide access tissue blood future research , include genetic study . Subjects meet criterion may participate study : Unwilling unable provide inform consent . Affected dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric comorbid condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent , determine treat physician .</criteria>
