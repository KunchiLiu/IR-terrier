	<brief_summary>Multicenter phase 1/2 study neoadjuvant Ibrutinib men localize prostate cancer undergo RP initial locally direct therapy curative intent . To assess immune response follow neoadjuvant treatment , tissue RP specimen compare tissue core biopsy specimen obtain prior treatment , subject serve control . Immune infiltration also compare reference cohort 12 patient undergone RP , match study population use UCSF CAPRA-S score .</brief_summary>
