	<brief_title>Fatigue Sarcoidosis - Treatment With Methylphenidate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcoidosis fatigue Sarcoidosis systemic granulomatous disease affect ethnic group age . In United Kingdom incidence disease 5.0 case per 100,000 patient year , mean age diagnosis 47 year , frequently affect patient work age ( Gribbin et al ) . The cause unknown cure ( Iannuzzi et al ) . Many patient suffer debilitate fatigue presently treatment . Fatigue describe `` core symptom '' sarcoidosis , present 80 % patient ( Marcellis et al ) . A `` post-sarcoidosis chronic-fatigue syndrome '' describe ( James ) , denote presence fatigue evidence active disease . The presence symptom show adversely affect quality life ( Michielsen et al ) . Although increase risk obstructive sleep apnoea sleep-disordered breathing occur sarcoidosis patient ( Michielsen et al ; Drent et al ) majority patient identifiable cause fatigue sarcoidosis . Both British Thoracic Society ( Bradley et al ) American Thoracic Society ( Costabel et al ) produce guideline physician treat people sarcoidosis . Neither guideline give advice treatment fatigue . Fatigue common problem sarcoidosis . In study 76 patient sarcoidosis , 50.7 % report pathological level fatigue , define Fatigue Assessment Scale ( FAS ) score great 21 unit , compare 8.6 % control . People report fatigue score 21 , poor EuroQoL Visual Analogue Scale ( EQVAS ) score compare people report fatigue score 21 ( mean score 0.561 v 0.792 , p &lt; 0.001 ) ( Unpublished data , Norfolk Norwich University Hospital ) . This show fatigue impact upon quality life sarcoidosis . Methylphenidate - treatment fatigue Methylphenidate ( isomer dexmethylphenidate ) , use treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( Keating et al ) , amphetamine-derivative work amplify dopamine signal inhibition dopamine reuptake enhancement extracellular dopamine basal ganglion ( Volkow et al ) . It use treat fatigue setting good effect . In placebo-controlled , double-blind trial post-chemotherapy participant fatigue , methylphenidate exhibit clinically significant reduction fatigue ( Lower et al ) . Prior result trial , Cochrane review treatment cancer-related fatigue 5 RCTs show improvement fatigue methylphenidate treatment , lead conclude `` current evidence support use psychostimulants cancer-related fatigue '' ( Minton et al ) . Another trial investigate methylphenidate treatment fatigue 109 HIV-positive patient 6-week period . Methylphenidate improve fatigue visual analogue scale , 26.2 point increase ( maximum 100 ) baseline , 41 % participant receive drug demonstrate great 50 % improvement visual analogue scale score ( Breitbart et al ) . In contrast , difference methylphenidate placebo see cohort 68 fatigued patient receive radiotherapy brain tumour follow 12 week period ( Butler et al ) . In case sarcoidosis , far one small study investigate use dexmethylphenidate fatigue ( Lower et al ) . Ten patient include double blind crossover trial . Participants report clinically statistically significant improvement fatigue measure FAS Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue ( FACIT-F ) score 8 week treatment , although statistically significant improvement see six minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) compare placebo . The drug well tolerate ; participant complete study significant increase side effect note patient receive placebo dexmethylphenidate . Rationale current study Prior design definitive study , issue feasibility undertake sufficiently large trial require resolve . Completed trial use methylphenidate 8-12 week , sustainability effect , tolerability medication long period retention participant within trial unknown . Whilst use medication methylphenidate may use continuous basis clinical setting , use 6-12 month basis may unreasonable , hence need review effect medication longer period . Furthermore , unclear many people would willing participate longer trial , many potential participant would suitable enrolment use present inclusion exclusion criterion . For reason , feasibility trial necessary committing large trial . In addition , trial evaluate exercise activity modify shuttle walk test ( MSWT ) accelerometer-measured change activity level . Although methylphenidate show significantly improve 6MWD ( Lower et al ) , large study use responsive test may require evaluate exercise capacity setting . This could self-paced test sub-maximal exercise test - show case study interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) patient ( include sarcoidosis ) peak oxygen uptake , carbon dioxide uptake ventilation lower 6MWD cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( Holland et al ) . By reach maximum exercise level may make test less responsive change . This particularly relevant give ILD cohort reach maximal exercise oxygen uptake 6MWD likely much limit cardiopulmonary function cohort anticipate enrolled study treatment fatigue therefore much likely get close peak oxygen uptake 6MWD . Given activity level measure accelerometer people sarcoidosis relate fatigue ( Korenromp et al ) , trial evaluate feasibility use outcome measure clinical trial , include whether participant wear device long enough ( i.e . 4 day 7 , least 10 hour per day ) get valid data estimate daily activity level . Study Design This parallel-arm RCT include 30 participant , randomise 1.5:1 basis favour active treatment arm ( 18 participant receive methylphenidate , 12 receive placebo ) . The rationale trial determine feasibility design perform sufficiently large RCT future look proof clinical effect methylphenidate treatment sarcoidosis-associated fatigue . As result , study power detect clinical difference clinical outcome , although measure analysed ( estimate effect size use future power calculation ) . Therefore primary outcome regard feasibility safety , treatment effect ( see Outcome Measures section ) . Participants receive either methylphenidate placebo 24 week , assessment perform 6 week completion trial . They carefully monitor initial 6 week ensure stable drug - time see every 2 week ( 0,2,4 6 week ) . Following period see less frequently ( 12 24 week , postal questionnaire perform 18 week ) detect sustainability effect . Determining treatment effect sustain second half trial period help establish long future trial need . Although participant require attend frequent visit hospital , trial design conjunction sarcoidosis patient ensure participant safety paramount .</detailed_description>
