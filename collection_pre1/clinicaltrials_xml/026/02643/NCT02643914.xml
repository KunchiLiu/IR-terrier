	<detailed_description>Nicotine common drug abuse United States , addiction strength comparable cocaine , heroin , alcohol . It primary addictive component tobacco , use markedly increase risk cancer , heart disease , asthma , miscarriage , infant mortality . Addiction think cause primarily intersection two component : 1 ) impact drug pharmacokinetics dynamic dopamine response , 2 ) dysregulation brain 's reward circuit . While term 'dysregulated ' tends use qualitatively within neuroscience literature , regulation precise testable meaning control system engineering , yet address quantitative manner current neuroimaging method model addiction . Current approach neuroimaging primarily focus identify node causal connection within meso-circuit interest , yet take next step treat node connection self-interacting dynamical system evolve time . Such approach critical improve understanding , therefore prediction , trajectory addiction well recovery . These trajectory likely nonlinear ( e.g. , involve threshold , saturation , self-reinforcement ) , well highly specific individual . This study design provide first step towards address gap : integrating ultra-high-field ( 7T ) ultra-fast ( &lt; 1 ) fMRI computational modeling , provide bridge dynamic meso-circuit regulation dynamic human addictive behavior . The investigator propose test hypothesis control system regulation , measure dynamic analysis fMRI data , predict—on individual basis—exactly addict smoker want take next puff . This achieve first validate MR-compatible nicotine delivery system , compare neurobiological autonomic effect cigarette e-cigarette . Once achieve , investigator acquire fMRI data addict smoker 'smoke . ' Using individual subject ' neuroimaging data , investigator derive couple differential equation control system predict crave behavioral response individual . Using independent data set estimate parameter test , investigator assess model 's accuracy predict individual subject 's craving , measure behaviorally frequency smoker self-administers nicotine . If successful , approach could exploit develop individualized prevention treatment addiction identify individual-specific amplitude , duration , frequency dose nicotine replacement therapy least likely trigger craving . More generally , method propose potential rigorously examine system-wide dysregulation addiction first time , open door exploration dysregulatory brain-based disease human .</detailed_description>
