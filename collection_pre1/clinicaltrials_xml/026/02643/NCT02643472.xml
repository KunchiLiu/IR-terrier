Short-term peer-to -peer program hospitalization decrease stress , anxiety depression mother , however , study evaluate effect long term post-discharge peer support . Children 's National ( CN ) provide medical home service CSHCN Parent Navigator Program ( PNP ) . Parent Navigators ( PNs ) CSHCN parent provide peer emotional support , access community resource , assistance navigate complicate health system . NICU graduate caregiver may benefit support provide PNs discharge . No data regard impact PNs patient family outcomes NICU graduate available . OBJECTIVE : To assess impact PNP parent 's self-efficacy , stress , anxiety , depression; infant health care utilization , immunization status . METHODS : 300 NICU graduate randomize receive either PN 12 month ( intervention group ) usual care ( comparison group ) . Baseline data 1 week , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month discharge collect caregiver group include scale self-efficacy , stress , anxiety , depression , infant healthcare utilization immunization status . Outcomes compare 12 month . PATIENT OUTCOMES ( PROJECTED ) The study outcomes parental self-efficacy , stress , anxiety , depression; infant health care utilization immunization status . ANTICIPATED IMPACT Prior study utilize small sample suggest peer support NICU reduce anxiety depression caregiver .

	<brief_title>GPS ( Giving Parents Support ) : Parent Navigation After NICU Discharge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Infants discharge neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) almost invariably high level health care need first year discharge , require multiple sub specialist visit , medication , and/or medical technology need . Parents NICU infant often overwhelm needs infant discharge home frequently support help cope . This study investigate impact peer peer support Parent Navigation program NICU graduate parent . The study aim achieve randomized control trial Parent Navigation use care resource notebook control intervention . The specific aim study : 1 . Determine Parent Navigation increase overall parental self-efficacy decrease stress among parent care child special health care need ( CSHCN ) measure repeated time point 12 month NICU discharge . Hypothesis 1a : Parent Navigation increase parental self-efficacy , compare control group . Hypothesis 1b : Parent Navigation decrease parent stress , compare control group . 2 . Determine Parent Navigation improve overall level anxiety depression parent child special health care need measure repeatedly 12 month NICU discharge . Hypothesis 2a : Parent Navigation improve parent anxiety , compare control group . Hypothesis 2b : Parent Navigation lessen parent depression , compare control group . 3 . Determine Parent Navigation positively impact infant health outcome 12 month NICU discharge . Hypothesis 3a : Parent Navigation/Intervention group significantly few hospitalization compare control group . Hypothesis 3b : Parent Navigation significantly few emergency department ( ED ) visit , compare control group . Hypothesis 3c : Parent Navigation result improve immunization status , compare control group . Hypothesis 3d . By support parent ' emotional function , infant developmental progress enhance . Background : NICU parent experience high level stress , anxiety , depression , low level self-efficacy . Neonates comprise one large group medically complex infant United States . Of 4 million live birth 2012 , 11.5 % ( ~460,000 ) bear preterm &lt; 37 week gestation . The District Columbia alone high rate ( 12.8 % ) preterm infant , 11 % high national average . The vast majority infant born preterm ~1 % full term infant significant illness birth ( e.g. , congenital anomaly ) require care neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) , ~30 % infant discharge NICU ( `` NICU graduate '' ) annually ( 110,000 baby ) require supplementary short -term ongoing specialty care increase risk long- term disability , include cerebral palsy , deafness , blindness , neurodevelopmental impairment . At discharge , large cohort neonate family face tremendous challenge transition highly structure medical environment less structure home environment . Some challenge identify include feel unprepared care infant home despite extensive teaching NICU setting , feel socially isolated typical celebratory process give birth go home baby disrupt serious medical condition prolong hospital stay . Additionally , depression anxiety among mother infant show associated infant feeding difficulty , suboptimal parenting practice , alter health care utilization . Parent navigation unique patient -centered intervention parent experience care child special health care need offer peer peer support mentor another parent child special health care need . In 2008 , Children 's National institute Parent Navigation program , Parent Navigators ( PNs ) , parent child special health care need , employ CN provide peer peer support parent child special health care need . These parent provide personal experience expertise navigate often confuse frustrate health care system . Although PN model base self-efficacy social support model , publish study impact PN parental self-efficacy , depression , stress , infant health outcome . The investigator believe neonates caregiver would benefit peer peer support provide PNs discharge . Currently , data regard impact PNs patient family outcomes NICU graduate . Preliminary Studies : As first phase study , investigator conduct focus group parent recently discharge NICU infant ( 4 focus group , n=18 participant ) , parent navigator ( 1 focus group n=3 ) , parent ( n=2 ) , NICU social worker , case manager , nurse ( 1 focus group , n=23 ) ; NICU provider ( 1 focus group , n=5 ) community provider ( n=2 ) . The investigator ' intervention inform data .</detailed_description>
