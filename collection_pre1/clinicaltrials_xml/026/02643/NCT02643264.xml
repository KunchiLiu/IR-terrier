	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Insula Treatment Alcohol Addiction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : To investigate effect repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) target insula alcohol use neural response alcohol-dependent patient . Study population : Treatment seek alcohol dependent subject ( N=82 ) , age 18-65 year , first complete standard alcohol withdrawal treatment need . Design : This double-blind , sham-controlled randomized study , comprise three phase . Participants hospitalize first two , outpatient third . During Phase 1 study ( screen ; 14 day ) , participant undergo set baseline assessment ; phase conclude consent , inclusion randomization . During Phase 2 ( treatment ; appr . 3 week , least first week hospitalize ) , participant first undergo MRI scan collect rest state structural data , receive one two treatment : Active ( 10Hz ) rTMS ; sham stimulation , target insula bilaterally . rTMS session conduct five time per week , 3 week , total 15 session . Stimulation H-coil design reach deep structure insula . A second MRI scan obtain end phase ass change rest state connectivity , evaluate insula activity task know activate structure . In addition , lumbar puncture carry end phase ass possible effect central neurotransmitter growth factor level , indexed cerebrospinal fluid . For Phase 3 ( follow-up , last 12 week ) , patient follow outpatient 12 week , clinic visit week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 12 post discharge ; measure alcohol use collect phase . Outcome measure : The co-primary outcome measure heavy alcohol consumption follow-up phase , assess use time-line follow-back methodology ; insula BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) responses task know induce insula activation . A number secondary exploratory measure also assess , include objective biomarkers alcohol consumption .</detailed_description>
