	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether bifocal soft contact lens ( CLs ) low addition nasally decentered optical zone effective control myopic progression child . Visual manipulation induce multifocal soft CLs high addition show inhibit eye growth myopia development child recent study . Several theory propose include alteration peripheral defocus , reduce accommodation demand , alteration binocular vision status increase ocular high order aberration . However , theory remain proven optical property performance multifocal soft CLs investigate child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Visual manipulation induce multifocal soft contact lens ( CLs ) high addition ( +2.00 D ) show inhibit eye growth myopia development child 25-50 % efficacy recent study . Several theory propose include ; alteration peripheral defocus , reduce accommodation demand , alteration binocular vision status increase ocular high order aberration , remain proven . However , effect control myopic progression bifocal CLs low addition study . Several study show multifocal soft CLs induce change ocular aberration degradation image quality adult , whereas optical property performance multifocal soft CLs investigate child . Due difference ocular structure function , instance , pupil size accommodation response , performance multifocal CLs child may vary compare adult . As result , essential ass optical quality lenses worn child myopia control , COAS ( Complete Ophthalmic Analysis System ) . The aim randomize clinical trial evaluate myopic progression child wear soft bifocal low addition CLs ( Menicon 2 week Duo ** ) use daily disposable lens , compare control subject wear single-vision spectacle . Myopia progression quantify change axial length ( AL ) cycloplegic refractive error ( Rx ) monitor 2 year single-masking . The optical performance bifocal CLs worn child also investigate . ( **this lens currently commercially available Japan . The oxygen permeability ( Dk ) 34 72 % water content , FDA group â…¡ . )</detailed_description>
