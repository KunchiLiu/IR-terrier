	<brief_summary>Presepsin ( formerly CD14 ) , glycoprotein receptor occur surface monocytes/macrophages . CD14 bind lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) complexes LPS bind protein ( LPB ) , trigger activation toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) , result production numerous pro-inflammatory cytokine . Following Presepsin activation bacterial product , CD14 complex release circulation soluble form ( sCD14 ) , turn cleave plasma protease generate sCD14 fragment call sCD14-subtype ( sCD14- ST ) . Plasma level sCD14 measure use automate chemo-luminescent assay ( PATHFAST ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis septic shock represent major challenge modern intensive care medicine , still recently publish international guideline demand ongoing research pathophysiology , diagnostics treatment . Currently , diagnosis sepsis base presence systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) criterion presence know infection . However , non-infectious SIRS associate acute tissue injury innate immune activation induce clinical syndrome analogous sepsis , include multiple trauma , pancreatitis , burn , autoimmune disease . Within field infectious disease , biomarker may use identify high risk group predispose condition , aid identification disease , direct therapy stratify patient accord specific risk factor , and/or aid therapeutic management order avoid relapse infection . Within recent year , dozens potential biomarkers infection describe . The diagnostic performance biomarkers usually measure term sensitivity , specificity , likelihood ratio area ROC ( Receiver Operating Characteristics ) curve . Recently , several research devolve interest discover pathway involve innate immunity . Mediators involve recognition elimination bacterial endotoxin identify new candidate biomarkers sepsis , namely lipopolysaccharide bind protein ( LBP ) soluble fraction membrane cluster differentiation 14 ( mCD14 ) . Membrane CD14 multifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein ( cell surface glycoprotein ) , constitutively express various cell , include monocyte , macrophage , neutrophil , etc . CD14 pattern recognition receptor bacterial molecule , namely lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) Gram-negative bacteria peptidoglycans together lipoteichoic acid Gram-positive bacteria . CD14 crucial activate toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) -specific proinflammatory signal cascade ultimately , initiate inflammatory reaction invade microorganism . In course inflammatory reaction , plasma protease activity generate soluble CD14 fragment ( sCD14 ) , presepsin .</detailed_description>
