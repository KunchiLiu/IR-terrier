	<brief_summary>The objective evaluate impact Pulsed electromagnetic field ( PEMF ) therapy patient Post-Concussive Syndrome Rivermead Post Concussion Symptom Questionnaire ( RPQ ) primary outcome , follow fatigue mood second tertiary outcome respectively . The investigator also investigate brain tissue activity oxygenation evaluate brain wave activity via non-invasive quantitative electroencephalogram near infrared spectroscopy test pre post study well understand metabolic effect PEMF intervention . The investigator hypothesize PEMF treatment effect improvement brain metabolism measure Near Infrared Spectroscopy turn assist improvement chronic symptom cognitive deficit , mood fatigue relate Post-Concussive Syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>76 subject enrolled experiment . Each subject go screening procedure outline . After consent screen complete subject receive hat deliver three 15 minute stimulation per day duration 6 week . Each study subject receive two hat , contain integrated PEMF device , do ensure continuity treatment case one hat stop work due battery run . The PEMF device use investigational , battery power custom-made stimulator able deliver electromagnetic field . This device operate low amplitude ( 0.05 gauss magnetic field strength ) require watch battery power , allow technology portable ( e.g. , use home ) , versatile , inexpensive , safe , ( vi ) integrate PEMF device wearable baseball hat improve tolerance compliance also monitor patient use configuration . The study device consist print circuit board PEMF signal generator AAA battery-driven power supply encase high density plastic , solid wire-loop antenna cover medical grade silicone , build standard baseball-style cap , antenna fit around large internal circumference . The device design easily use activate don cap . Once don , 15-minute treatment cycle start stop automatically . The device require least 2 hour treatment , activated period elapse . A light power supply blink unit active . EEG NIR obtain visit 1 , 2 three month follow good evaluate brain oxygenation metabolism .</detailed_description>
