	<brief_title>Morning-Only 4 L PEG v Split Dose Prep Afternoon Colonoscopies , Endoscopist-Blinded Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim colorectal cancer screen reduce mortality . This effectively achieve colonoscopy direct visualization entire colon detect preneoplastic lesion adenomatous polyp . Bowel preparation quality critical accuracy colonoscopy , time required complete procedure success . On hand , poor quality bowel preparation show associate lower adenoma detection rate . Prior study show time colonoscopy one major factor influence bowel preparation quality afternoon colonoscopy notable high failure rate . This failure rate relate poor bowel preparation quality . Given , number afternoon colonoscopy perform still high due increase need colonoscopy . Therefore , suggest improve bowel preparation quality reduce failure rate afternoon colonoscopy . Several study split-dose bowel preparation show superior conventional day-before regimen , term preparation quality patient 's tolerability . Another study split-dose bowel preparation also show associate well adenoma detection rate , good polyp detection rate colonoscopy completion rate . There also study compare day dose vs. day-before afternoon colonoscopy show day superior day before.There data compare quality preparation colonoscopy patient take day 4L preparation vs. 4 L split-dose preparation afternoon colonoscopy . Using 4L PEG-ELS solution , investigator aim evaluate efficacy patient 's tolerability day versus split-dose regimen .</detailed_description>
