	<brief_title>Continued Study Artificial Vision : Evaluation BrainPort速 System Investigation Visual Ambulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence blindness US adult population 0.8 % range 3/10000 15/10000 child . Data world health organization show 500,000 child become blind year . The annual cost blindness federal government $ 4 billion cost lifetime support unpaid tax blind person $ 1 million . There need restore vision blind patient . Research vision restoration develop fast . There multiple type approach toward produce useful artificial vision . One directly send image video camera visual cortex via electrode array intracranially place visual cortex blind patient . Another one surgically place electrode array beneath retina patient whose optic nerve still healthy . Both require major surgery high risk , neither available routine clinical application . The one non-invasive easy use call BrainPort速 system . The BrainPort速 system manufacture Wicab , Inc . It commercially available affordable consumer . This system novel , bionic , non-invasive , vision bypass system conveys environment image spectacle-frame-mounted video-camera brain via electro-tactile tongue array . The electro-tactile stimulation deliver tongue-array place tongue allow user interpret image object camera 's visual field .</detailed_description>
