At Visit 1 ( Day 0 ) , subject commence microneedling treatment atrophic acne scar . Subjects return clinic Week 3 Week 6 ( Visits 2 3 , respectively ) follow-up evaluation additional cycle microneedling treatment . At Week 12 ( Visit 4 ) , subject commence Period II randomize Bellafill Treatment ( Track A ) No Treatment ( Track B ) : - Track A : Consists three ( 3 ) study visit . At Visit 4 , subject randomize `` Bellafill '' group receive treatment Bellafill atrophic acne scar . Subjects return Visit 5A ( Month 1 randomization ) evaluation follow-up , receive touch-up injection Bellafill achieve optimal correction ( necessary ) . Subjects followed-up Visits 6A 7A occur Month 3 Month 6 , respectively , last Bellafill treatment . - Track B : Consists one ( 1 ) study visit . At Visit 4 , subject randomize `` No Treatment '' group complete visit evaluation return follow-up Visit 5B ( approx . Month 3 randomization ) .</detailed_description>
