	<detailed_description>Background Single multiple point mutation tyrosine kinase domain ( TKD ) BCR-ABL1 fusion gene chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) Ph-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia represent important know mechanism resistance tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) . It conceivable pre-existing point mutation CML stem cell attributable genomic instability confer BCR-ABL1 fusion protein give rise outgrowth resistant subclones onset treatment-insensitive disease selection pressure TKI therapy . Early detection subclones may therefore prognostic therapeutic relevance . The recently publish immunophenotype CML stem cell ( Hermann et al . Blood 2014 ) , recent report NGS ( next-generation sequencing ) -based method facilitate sensitive detection quantitative monitoring BCR-ABL1 subclones carry single compound mutation ( Kastner et al . European Journal Cancer 2014 ) facilitate screen clinically relevant mutant subclones stem cell early progenitor cell . Hypothesis Detection mutant subclones within stem cell early progenitor compartment diagnosis early therapy Ph-positive leukemia , monitor proliferation kinetics , permit early prediction resistant disease ongoing TKI treatment . Experimental approach Bone marrow ( BM ) peripheral blood ( PB ) sample collect upon informed consent patient Ph-positive leukemia diagnosis ( BM+PB ) , subsequently 3-month interval ( PB ; BM upon availability ) first year therapy base include TKIs . Isolation CD ( cluster differentiation ) 34+ cell carry additional phenotypic marker characterize stem cell early progenitor cell ( CD38-/CD25+/CD26+ CML , CD19 Ph-ALL ) perform flow sorting . The entire BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain ( TKD ) amplify cDNA ( complementary DNA ) specific exon interest DNA establish protocol , bidirectional sequencing perform ultra-deep sequencing use NGS . Mutant subclones identify diagnosis debulking treatment-sensitive leukemic burden early treatment ( 3 month time point ) , monitor NGS month 12 therapy . BCR-ABL1 transcript monitor accord International Scale ( IS ) parallel . DNA isolate fingernail clipping use germline control ABL1 TKD . The testing perform blinded fashion prevent treatment adjustment accord experimental data .</detailed_description>
