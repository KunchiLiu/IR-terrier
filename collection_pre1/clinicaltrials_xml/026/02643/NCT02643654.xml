	<brief_summary>Hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS ) chronic inflammatory skin disorder . Although adalimumab recently license moderate severe HS , many case fail respond relapse treatment . Favorable outcome recently conduct double-blind randomized clinical study efficacy anakinra , one interleukin ( IL ) -1alpha blocker , hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS ) , lead validate efficacy MABp1 , true human antiIL-1α antibody case .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS ) chronic devastate skin disorder affect area rich apocrine gland . Nodules appear affect area ; progressively become swollen rupture release pu . This process occur repeatedly leading sinus tract formation scar . This disease course create frustrating situation patient also physician . Traditional treatment comprise short-courses antibiotic surgical excision . However , relapse rule HS lead severe impairment quality life . The Dermatology Quality Life Index ( DQLI ) HS 8.9 , high skin disorder . This devastate disorder often neglect consider rare situation . However , HS seem indiscriminately affect global population . A large epidemiological survey France report 0.97 % disease prevalence . The exact pathophysiology HS unknown . Both familial non-familial case HS exist . Familial HS le 5 % case usually inherit dominant autosomal mode . Mutations gene encode gene complex nicastrin-γ-secretase predominant hereditary HS . However , little know genetic predisposition non-familial HS comprise great majority case . Two study investigator conduct explore predisposition HS among patient carry single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene encode pro-inflammatory cytokine namely TNF IL-12RB1 . Results show carriage haplotype comprise minor frequency SNP alleles promoter region TNF increase likelihood HS ; furthermore patient less likely respond treatment anti-TNF agent . In parallel , haplotyping gene SNPs exon 7 exon 10 IL-12RB1 comprise seven constitutive SNPs show carriage h2 haplotype compose four minor frequency SNP allele associate severe disease phenotype . These result indicate strong component implication innate immune response pathogenesis HS . In conjunction follow successful phase II trial , two phase III PIONEER study end significant improvement patient 12 week treatment adalimumab . A novel score , HS clinical response ( HiSCR ) score , introduce trial suggest evaluation efficacy new formulation HS . Using score , find success rate adalimumab achieve positive HiSCR 12 week treatment range 40 60 % . This mean several patient respond adalimumab treatment whereas others may relapse initial response . The investigator recently conclude phase 2 , double-blind , randomize study efficacy anakinra treatment administer 100mg subcutaneously daily 12 consecutive week compare placebo 19 patient ; 10 allocate placebo arm nine anakinra arm ( EudraCT2011-005145-12 , www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01558375 ) . Results favorable clinical efficacy anakinra . The primary endpoint define disease activity marginally achieve modified intent-to-treat population . Regarding secondary endpoint , treatment anakinra effective : ) prolong time new exacerbation compare placebo arm ; b ) modulate cytokine stimulation peripheral blood mononuclear cell . More precisely , production interferon-γ significantly decrease production IL-22 increase compare placebo arm . HiSCR score initially include study endpoint score develop trial submit authority . Retrospective validation HiSCR score show significant reduction week 12 7 patient ( 77.8 % ) treat anakinra compare three patient ( 30 % ) treat placebo ( p : 0.039 ) . The considerable efficacy anakinra block interleukin ( IL ) -1alpha ( IL-1α ) lead consider significant role IL-1α pathogenesis HS . MABp1 first-in-class true human monoclonal antibody clone directly human B lymphocyte specifically target IL-1α . Results first-in-man trial recently publish , fifty-two patient metastatic cancer enrol open-label phase 1 study . The drug well-tolerated , tumor response observe , interestingly , treatment accompanied increase lean body weight . The purpose clinical study evaluate safety efficacy MABp1 compare placebo patient moderate severe HS either fail previous treatment antiTNF regimen relapse antiTNF regimen treatment naïve unwilling receive subcutaneous adalimumab treatment . The rationale behind promising success MABp1 rely recent finding show heterogeneity cytokine skin lesion several patient express huge concentration TNFα lesion express low concentration TNFα huge concentration IL-1α .</detailed_description>
