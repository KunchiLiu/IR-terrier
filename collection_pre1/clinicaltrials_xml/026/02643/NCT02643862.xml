	<brief_title>Study Using Xolair Rush Multi Oral Immunotherapy Multi Food Allergic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We enroll multi food allergic participant ( 4-55 year age ) prove `` multi food allergy '' . We anticipate enrol 60 participant allergy , least two food . Participants must food specific IgE &gt; 4kU/L allergen skin test reactivity food allergen â‰¥ 6 mm wheal diameter . We choose criterion associate low likelihood natural loss food allergy duration protocol . These value specific IgE SPT chosen base opinion 4 expert . Participants also must total IgE &lt; 1500kU/L , clinical reaction double blind placebo control food challenge ( DBPCFC ) food proteins/powders establish sensitivity give food proteins/powders ( milk , egg , peanut , almond , wheat , cashew , sesame seed , soy , walnut , hazelnut ) clinical reaction placebo ( oat ) per CMC section IND . Participants undergo rush desensitization day week 8 maximum dose 1,250 mg total protein . Participants ingest either 2 5 food allergen , depend allergy screen . They consume home dos two week base result document reaction . Upon return CFRU ( Clinical Food Research Unit ) two week later , dose escalation attempt . This cycle continue participant reach maximum dose 2,000 mg protein daily food allergen ( two five food allergen ingest participant ) . No 5 allergen give .</detailed_description>
