	<brief_summary>Japanese encephalitis ( JE ) lead cause viral neurological disease disability Asia . A live attenuate vaccine ( LJEV ) manufacture China several advantage JE vaccines one dose schedule , use infant , cheap cost . Because LJEV prequalified World Health Organization ( WHO ) 2013 , likely used country , possibly co-administered first dose measles-containing vaccine ( MCV ) ensure early protection reduce additional vaccination visit . The evidence immunogenicity safety co-administration LJEV MCV limit . Only one study conduct Philippines examine co-administration MCV LJEV among 9 month infant , result show proportion achieve sero-protection measles follow MCV ( 96 % ) slightly low MCV-only group ( 100 % ) , measles antibody titre also slightly low co-administration group . Due limit evidence available , WHO position paper measles vaccine encourage investigation possible impact co-administration LJEV measles vaccine effectiveness . In China , Measles-Rubella combine vaccine ( MR ) LJEV give 8 month age nationally . Considering China reach towards goal measles elimination , important conduct study compare immunogenicity MR administer alone LJEV , also evaluate safety tolerability LJEV administer MR among 8 month infant . This study prospective , randomize , open-label , multi-center study enrol infant age 8 month . Basic demographic information infant take blood sample collect enrollment ( baseline ) 6weeks follow administration MR , measles antibody measure , compare seroconversion rate assess non-inferiority . All infant monitor adverse event MR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : - To determine whether sero-conversion rate measles co-administering measles-rubella ( MR ) vaccine live attenuate JE vaccine 8 month old low sero-conversion rate among vaccinated MR vaccine alone . Secondary Objective : - Sero-conversion rate rubella co-administering MR vaccine live attenuate JE vaccine 8 month old less vaccinated MR vaccine alone . - To describe incidence adverse reaction concurrent group non-concurrent vaccination group initial vaccination follow-up period . Subjects : - This study enroll healthy infant 8 month old 8 month plus two week age . Study Arms : - The subject divide two group : MR+JE vaccine co-administration group MR vaccine group . - After obtain informed consent parent legal guardian , infant randomly assign one two group mention . Children family basic demographic information collect enrollment . One blood sample take vaccination measure baseline antibody level another blood sample 6 week ( 42-48 day ) vaccination test measles rubella antibody response . JE vaccine give MR vaccine group second blood draw . Adverse reaction monitor record MR vaccination follow-up period . Sampling size : - Assuming seropositivity rate 93 % measles minimal interference JE coadministration , power 0.90 0.05 significance level ( one-tailed ) , non-inferiority margin 5 % , sample size per group would 447 526 15 % attrition . - The total sample size would around 1052 . Subject Assignment : - The subject randomly assign MR+JE group MR group . In order randomize two group among different vaccination clinic , every 8 subject allocate one randomized unit ; random code allocate MR+JE group MR group accord ratio 1:1 . The subject number vaccination clinic integer multiple 8 . This arrangement need code 132 randomize unit , result total 1056 subject , slightly high calculated sample size . - The 1056 subject allocate 2 province equally , 528 subject province . In province 264 infant MR+JE group 264 infant MR group . Standard Operating Procedures field : The specific procedures vaccination clinic participate project subject follow : 1 . Make list target child vaccination clinic , arrange appointment vaccination child 8 month old . 2 . The child 's guardian take child get vaccination accord appointment . 3 . Recruit research subject , sign inform consent . 4 . Fill `` subject screening form '' , screen eligible subject . 5 . The first blood sample collection . 6 . Assign group accord cod envelope . 7 . Corresponding vaccination MR+JE MR accord group information . 8 . Observation 30 minute vaccination vaccination clinic . 9 . Fill questionnaire observation 10 . Distribute `` diary card '' , notify return vaccination clinic six week later . 11 . Follow health condition adverse event vaccination . 12 . When subject come back vaccination clinic 6 week later , take `` diary card '' back , check information . 13 . A second blood sample collection . 14 . JE vaccine inoculation MR group . Observation 30 minute . 15 . Inform subject survey . Statistical Analysis Plan - Primary statistical analysis compare sero-conversion rate measles rubella MR+JE group MR group use non-inferiority criterion . - Secondary analysis compare measles rubella antibody titer level MR+JE group MR group , describe adverse reaction group 6 week MR vaccination . Quality Assurance Plan 1 . Training Investigators : Administrative technical personnel level study area require participate training study objective , enrollment procedure , data collection , data entry management , quality control measure , sample handle transport , operation involve . 2 . Supervision Monitoring : Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention ( China CDC ) supervise monitor province least two time implementation period ; , province ( prefecture ) supervise monitor county least two time implementation period , county level supervise monitor vaccination clinic select appointment day . The focus supervision monitor observe whether vaccination clinic strictly follow protocol procedure problem find quickly resolve timely feedback . Any serious consistent problem report high level , correction make level project area . 3 . Sample Management : Samples collect stored secure , locked laboratory , cold chain equipment , temperature monitoring record . The serum sample tube A tube B separately package transported county province , designate laboratory , avoid loss unexpected accident . 4 . Vaccine Management : This study use vaccine vaccine use national immunization program . Vaccination clinic record vaccine type , number vaccine dos , batch number . Expiration date monitor expired vaccine use . 5 . Logistics Support : China CDC provide sample cod bar , consent form , investigation questionnaire , data collection form , operation manual . Provincial / prefecture CDCs responsible provision procurement equipment/materials use blood collection , serum separation , transportation storage , laboratory supply , ensure material meet study requirement .</detailed_description>
