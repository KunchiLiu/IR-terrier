	<brief_title>Etomidate Versus Ketamine Emergency Endotracheal Intubation : Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critically ill individual require emergency endotracheal intubation ( placement breathe tube patient 's mouth ) usually require sedation anesthesia make process tolerable . There several medication choice anesthesia , include medication like etomidate , ketamine propofol . Of , etomidate ketamine frequently use critically ill patient minimal effect patient 's vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate ) . Both etomidate ketamine standard-of-care medication , locally nationally , frequently use sedate patient procedure . Both etomidate ketamine potential side effect . One potential side effect etomidate suppression adrenal gland function . It known affect patient ' outcome significant way . One potential side effect ketamine slight increase patient ' heart rate . It known affect patient ' outcome significant way . The EvK Trial conduct Parkland Memorial Hospital investigator Departments Anesthesiology , Emergency Medicine , Medicine / Critical Care Medicine , Surgery , Pharmacy . The study randomize critically ill patient require emergency endotracheal intubation one two group : Etomidate Ketamine . We observe patient ' outcome . The study intervention involve randomize individual patient one medication . All study follow-up beyond point do review medical record . Because nature study - emergency procedure critically ill patient - study require institutional review board permission obtain write informed consent patient prior randomization study drug administration endotracheal tube placement . Prior enrollment patient study team carry comprehensive Community Consultation Plan , design inform community research study . This accordance rule set forth U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA 21 CFR 50.24 ) .</detailed_description>
