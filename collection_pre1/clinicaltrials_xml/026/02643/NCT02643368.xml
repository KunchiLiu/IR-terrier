	<brief_summary>This open-label phase IV , randomize control trial mOPV2 alone mOPV2 along IPV . This trial assess impact type 2 immunogenicity reduce interval mOPV2 dos . The trial also evaluate difference immunogenicity first dose mOPV2 , two dose schedule four week interval , administer simultaneously IPV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Strategic Advisory Group Experts Immunization ( SAGE ) recommend phased cessation OPVs start serotype 2 ( OPV2 ) . This last case type 2 wild poliovirus ( WPV2 ) report 1999 type 2 vaccine poliovirus associate high risk cause paralysis due reversion vaccine derive poliovirus ( VDPV ) , revert virus acquires ability cause paralysis also ability transmit person-to-person . Withdrawal OPV2 do replacement worldwide trivalent OPV ( tOPV ) bivalent ( type 1 3 ) OPV ( bOPV ) use routine immunization campaign . After tOPV bOPV switch , strict biosafety requirement use vaccine contain OPV2 . Trivalent OPV longer exist use monovalent OPV2 ( mOPV2 ) limit respond type 2 outbreak . To respond poliovirus type 2 outbreak , Global Polio Eradication Initiative propose deliver use mOPV2 campaign conduct primary zone outbreak IPV campaign conduct area adjacent outbreak zone . Therefore , mOPV2 critical component response poliovirus type 2 outbreak . Typically , polio campaign conduct interval 4 week . Recently , clinical trial conduct icddr , b U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) Matlab Mirpur Bangladesh demonstrate non-inferiority type 1 seroconversion bOPV mOPV1 2 week interval compare 4 week dose . Based finding , Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) conclude immune response `` OPV satisfactory interval dos shorten 14 even 7 day ( case mOPV1 ) '' use short-interval campaign deliver mOPV1 bOPV area security-limited access outbreak response . However , data current plan polio clinical trial assess impact immunogenicity mOPV2 reduction interval mOPV2 dose administration mOPV2 combination IPV . Therefore , find trial propose protocol direct immediate implication strategy respond type 2 polio outbreak . Field site : The study carry urban slum Mirpur Mohakahli Dhaka .</detailed_description>
