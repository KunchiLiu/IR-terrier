	<brief_summary>Post-operative visual loss ( POVL ) follow non-ocular surgical procedure infrequent severe complication . Little understood complication , case seem result loss blood flow optic nerve . This pilot , single center , prospective , randomize , two-arm study involve 20 subject The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center schedule undergo spine surgery require prone position least two hour general anesthesia total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring . Patients randomize either general anesthesia TIVA , wear SightSaver device monitor visual evoke potential ( VEPs ) surgery order detect possible change optic nerve function may lead POVL . We hypothesize new , flexible , disposable device yield well result patient satisfaction device currently use visual monitoring prone spine surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The exact mechanism underlie POVL poorly understand , nearly case seem involve ischemic optic neuropathy ( ION ) . Posterior ION commonly result spinal procedure . The spine surgery associate risk factor include : prone position , Trendelenburg positioning , blood loss , prolonged procedure , use vasoconstriction agent correct blood pressure , direct ocular compression , hypotension [ 1,2 ] . Given fact suspect mechanism gradual infarction optic nerve , POVL could theoretically prevent base early detection reversible optic nerve dysfunction . Visual evoked potential ( VEP ) highly sensitive method detect optic nerve dysfunction , include ischemia . During IONM , emit light pass lens , reach retina cause hyperpolarization . The signal generate retina response flash light know electroretinogram ( ERG ) . This response may record use conventional neurophysiological equipment reflect overall retinal function . The VEP peak generate passage electrical signal retina via optic pathway primary visual cortex , also register IONM . Measurements VEP peak anesthesia vary depend type anesthetic regimen , produce interference electrical impulses others . The problem encounter VEP monitor numerous : reusable device must clean patient , tightly fit goggles pose risk damage eye , goggles may fall move intraoperatively difficult reposition procedure underway . Also , light emit diode tend weak produce adequate stimulus . This pilot study present new different approach current method . The SightSaverTM visual stimulator design consist follow key advantage current technology : hygienically superior re-usable goggles , provide physical protection ocular region , use high intensity diode adhesive foam padding shape contour periocular region . This pilot , single center , prospective , randomize , two-arm study involve 20 subject The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center schedule undergo spine surgery require prone position least two hour general anesthesia TIVA intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring . Eligible subject provide voluntary write informed consent include study 1:1 randomization ratio two arm , n=10 patient per two anesthesia regimen group : general anesthesia TIVA . All patient wear SightSaverTM visual stimulator . IONM VEP include insertion half-inch needle electrode place skin either side eye , top forehead three along back head . Flashes light , deliver continuous interval , emit diode mount SightSaverTM visual stimulator . After baseline VEP establish patient , monitor VEP occur every 30 minute surgery . If monitoring process , significant VEP waveform change occur , alert trigger surgical staff check four different parameter : technical issue goggles , anesthetic change , significant blood loss blood pressure change . Analysis data collect used evaluate efficacy SightSaverTM visual stimulator intraoperative VEP-based detection significant visual change prone spine surgery .</detailed_description>
