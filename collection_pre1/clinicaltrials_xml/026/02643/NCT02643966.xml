	<brief_title>Assessment Periodic Screening Women With Denser Breast Using WBUS DBT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study design evaluate role whole breast ultrasound ( WBUS ) screen breast cancer . In particular , interest investigate value use WBUS adjunct ( supplementary imaging ) Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ( DBT ) base screen woman dense ( heterogeneously extremely dense ) breast primary screen examination group woman . Women schedule routine mammography include DBT exam agree participate study sign inform consent undergo ( visit ) DBT image part clinical exam whole breast ultrasound ( WBUS ) year three round screen plus one year follow-up . The DBT image WBUS interpret independently two experienced radiologist standard clinical screening procedure . One radiologist interpret DBT radiologist interpret WBUS . Using modify `` LOGICAL OR '' approach women/subjects may recall diagnostic work-up ( examination ) . If subject recall , follow standard/routine clinical procedure follow-up investigator verify outcomes . If neither radiologist recall subject , subject follow conventional management investigator verify outcome . The finding DBT WBUS examination , well result follow-up , collect , record analyze .</detailed_description>
