	<brief_summary>In India , high diabetes prevalence cost management relative personal income render country appropriate environment seek test new , less expensive aid care . Education motivation induce behavioural modification , important component care . Conventional diabetes education programme involve personal contact method useful expensive . Compliance medication also important data suggest compliance low people establish type 2 diabetes ( little information recently diagnose disease ) . Mobile phone could provide inexpensive scaleable delivery vehicle component care . There 5 billion wireless subscriber 70 % live low middle income country . Mobile phone ownership high India increase proportion Mobile phone and/or home computer . The investigator plan clinical trial India ass whether benefit enhance text message intervention deliver mobile phone people newly diagnose Type 2 diabetes .

	<brief_title>Effectiveness Automated Mobile Phone Based Text Messaging Improvement Glycaemic Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>India currently 65 million people type 2 diabetes number increase . In addition human cost , diabetes imposes large economic burden . In average income India , diabetes care consumes 25 % family budget one member affect proportionately affected member ( uncommon ) ; much expenditure medical nursing cost aim achieve good glycaemic control . Diabetes management important lead well long-term clinical outcome . The proof principle trial - United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) patient type 2 diabetes demonstrate glycaemic control time diagnosis produce beneficial effect trial persist least ten year afterwards ( despite confluence HbA1c level post-trial ) . There continued improvement microvascular complication emergent significant reduction myocardial infarction death - 'legacy effect ' . Similar prolong benefit demonstrate Type 1 diabetes Diabetes Control Complication Trial ( DCCT ) follow-up ( least 17 year ) . Improving glycaemic control involve lifestyle modification ( diet physical activity ) , prompt introduction hypoglycaemic therapy necessary compliance treatment monitoring . Dietary measure early diagnosis lead improve glycaemia reduction cardiovascular risk factor . The importance physical activity often overlook , contribute maintenance weight loss long-term , improve physical fitness reduces cardiovascular risk factor . At shortly diagnosis , diabetes education aim lifestyle change helpful modify behaviour reduce HbA1c . Although programme effective , benefit diminish time e.g . DESMOND programme result improved HbA1c level twelve month three year . There evidence sustain benefit may likely educational programme reinforce later stage . A major barrier implementation education programme , particularly include reinforcement , cost . Because involve personal contact , programmes expensive reality , offer small proportion patient , even developed country . Although attempt make utilise trained non-medical , non-nursing staff education programme India , model , less expensive , widely adopt . Attendance educational session also problematic , require take time work away family , venue consider inaccessible . Text messaging ( short message service , SMS ) potential overcome difficulty . It relatively cheap potentially scalable . For example , people pre-diabetes India investigator show 36 % reduction progression diabetes 2 year text messaging-assisted behavioural modification . This reduction similar achieve India use personal contact method . There relatively high quality study role text message mobile phone contact aid management establish Type 2 diabetes . In pilot study India , investigator demonstrate text messaging improve compliance medication . A recent Cochrane review IT-assisted methodology diabetes care education suggest small benefit glycaemia , great mobile phone ( oppose home computer ) delivery medium . The average lowering HbA1c , result mobile phone input range study 5.5 mmol/mol ( 0.5 % ) . This clinically significant . Part reason benefit may reside nature mobile phone contact , passive , appropriately design , message content encourage rather threatening nature . The message also send repeatedly , frequency timing dictate recipient .</detailed_description>
