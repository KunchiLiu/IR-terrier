	<brief_summary>Recently , data ( PLATO ) AstraZeneca study platelet inhibition patient outcome , Phase III pivotal efficacy safety study duration 12 month compare ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily dose clopidogrel 75 mg daily dose acute coronary syndrome patient ASA background , demonstrate superiority ticagrelor clopidogrel prevention fatal non-fatal cardiovascular event . Currently , mechanism mortality reduction remain uncertain . One hypothesis adenosine mediate theory ticagrelor show enhance adenosine-induced vasodilation . Several experimental clinical study support hypothesis adenosine could reduce cardiac ischaemia reperfusion damage . Moreover , recent study demonstrate ticagrelor enhances adenosine-induced coronary vasodilatory response healthy human . However , available data coronary circulation effect chronic treatment ticagrelor patient ACS alter rest coronary blood flow dynamic due advance coronary artery disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel Microcirculation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , randomize , open-label , active control study two parallel study group . For inclusion study subject fulfill follow criterion : 1 . Provision inform consent prior study specific procedures 2 . Female male age 20-85 year 3 . All patient ACS schedule PCI eligible , assume ability understand character individual consequence participation well give write informed consent . 4 . Be able understand comply requirement study , judge investigator . To investigate effect ticagrelor coronary microcirculation , IMR measure twice , 6 month apart lesion , compare clopidogrel . The IMR define simultaneously measure distal coronary pressure divide inverse thermodilution-derived hyperaemic mean transit time ( Tmn ) , simply , distal coronary pressure multiply Tmn .</detailed_description>
