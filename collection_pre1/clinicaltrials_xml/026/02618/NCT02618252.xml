	<brief_title>Ultrasound vs Veinviewer Patients With Difficulty IV Access</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous ( IV ) access important patient care emergency medicine estimate 78 % ED patient would require 3 ED resource blood test , medication , contrast , fluid . Care patient difficult intravenous access ( DIVA ) could significantly delay may take 120 minute establish IV access patient severe DIVA . Many solution DIVA also establish avoid central venous catheter insertion , include use ultrasound near-infrared image system peripheral IV insertion . Using ultrasound ED show decrease rate central venous catheter ( CVC ) insertion . However , result ultrasound-guided peripheral IV insertion ( USGPIV ) mixed . Among patient DIVA , Costantino report USGPIV require less time successful first cannulation few puncture compare traditional approach landmark palpation . However , study show USGPIV improve successful first attempt compare traditional IV insertion , may take even long time successfully establish IV . USGPIV success rate require train nurse ED technician operator - dependent . Patients difficulty IV access vein ' clinical accessibility low , example , less visible less palpable . The near-infrared imaging device , Christie Digital 's VeinViewer , improve situation use infra-red light make vein visible eye . Compared routine IV insertion , near-Infra red imaging device show increase first successful attempt le time child DIVA improve visualization peripheral vein . However , show high rate successful attempt fast time non-selected adult . The efficacy near-infrared device establish among adult patient DIVA .</detailed_description>
