	<brief_summary>To evaluate impact outcome currently accept antithrombotic strategy base administration new P2Y12 receptor blocker ( prasugrel ticagrelor ) population non ST elevate ACS ( NSTEACS ) patient initial invasive indication . Furthermore , evaluate effect bivalirudin administration comparison standard therapy unfractioned heparin ( plus provisional anti-GPIIbIIIa ) NSTEACSpatients undergo PCI thus receive potent antiplatelet agent may theoretically favor occurrence bleeding . A combined measure efficacy safety endpoint , so-called net clinical benefit ( NACE ) , consider early ( 30 day ) mid term ( 12 month ) follow-up .</brief_summary>

( Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test do within 28 day prior enrollment ) . Other medical illness ( e.g. , cancer congestive heart failure ) know history substance abuse ( alcohol , cocaine , heroin etc . ) per physician judgment may cause noncompliance protocol confound data interpretation associate limited life expectancy . Subject belong vulnerable population ( per investigator 's judgment , e.g. , subordinate hospital staff sponsor staff ) subject unable read write . Currently participate investigational drug device trial complete primary endpoint clinically interfere current trial endpoint . Subject must agree participate clinical investigation period three year follow index procedure , include clinical trial medication invasive procedure . Questionnairebased study , study noninvasive require medication allow . Prior history hemorrhagic ischemic stroke , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , subarachnoid hemorrhage . History intracranial neoplasm , arterovenous malformation , aneurysm . Have receive fibrinolytic therapy within 48 hour entry randomization study . Have active pathological bleeding history bleed diathesis . Have clinical finding , judgment investigator , associate increase risk bleeding .
