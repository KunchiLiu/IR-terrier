	<brief_summary>This project involve create novel personalise BCI train system target social communication difficulty , inattentive symptom problem often find ASD/ADHD child . 20 participant age 8 12 recruit undergo 24 training session 8-week period . During session , child play computer game interface specifically design train attention facial emotional recognition , use BCI device . To reinforce treatment , train system enhanced inclusion eye-tracker target lack preferential eye contact child ASD exhibit . The investigator hypothesize participant show improvement social skill attention post treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot trial aim improve attention level child comorbid ASD/ADHD . Twenty participant age 8 12 year comorbid ASD/ADHD recruit . Most therapy involves least total 20 session ( 4 ) ; , intervention protocol include 24 session follow follow one month completion . The participant attend 24 brain training session 8-week period , play computer game design improve attention , facial recognition , emotion recognition . Participants randomize either Intervention Waitlist-Control study arm group , latter proceeds train wait-time 8 week . The investigator hypothesize participant Intervention group show improve symptom compare Waitlist-Control group week 8 . This pilot study provide preliminary data support efficacy investigator new BCI-based training programme potentially pave way large randomize control trial . Children comorbid ASD/ADHD great impairment attention , social skill eye gaze . The investigator believe focus symptom might lead potentially well treatment outcome . Also , current treatment ASD/ADHD limit tax , time-consuming , incur side effect . If BCI-based training programme positive impact child diagnose ASD ADHD , potentially alternative long-term treatment . Unlike medication behavioural intervention , neurofeedback therapy side effect may engage child . It potential make available eventually use patient 's home therefore administer one 's time convenience . In 2010 , PI team conduct pilot study investigate novel intervention treatment ADHD . The study involve subject 7 12 year age diagnose either combine inattentive ADHD subtypes . The subject receive 20 session BCI train 10-week period . The BCI training innovative design integrate neurofeedback system use algorithm analyze EEG brain wave , use drive computer interface sustain certain threshold attention . Teachers child intervention group report large improvement ADHD inattentive score although statistically significant . Parents also feed back intervention relatively safe use free adverse effect . In 2012 , team complete another study improve upon technology investigate feasibility new training programme ( simple headset use two dry lead sensor instead EEG cap ) 20 unmedicated ADHD child participant . The treatment intervention intensify 24 session 8 week follow 3 monthly booster training session . An additional component add training module participant require complete stroop task calibration process training . This personalise intervention improve accuracy EEG parameter . In open-label trial , parent report statistically significant improvement inattentive hyperactive-impulsive symptom ADHD Rating Scale 8 week , suggest potential efficaciousness novel BCI-based training programme potentially efficacious treatment ADHD . In 2013 , larger-scale randomise control trial begin investigate efficacy BCI training treat inattentive symptom ADHD . The randomized study aim enroll 160 child age 6 12 undergo 24 session BCI training session 8 week follow 3 booster session . ADHD symptom assess primarily blind clinician parent well base feedback obtain respective school teacher . The study currently ongoing estimate complete July 2016 . Therapy use non-invasive BCI system-based game may represent alternative treatment child ADHD ASD . If demonstrate efficacious , parent likely prefer compare current treatment modality medication ( potentially serious side effect ) behavior management ( parent generally find difficult challenge ) . Children also likely enjoy treatment hence , comply good . In long term , approach system may potential attention cognitive enhancement patient cognitive impairment early dementia .</detailed_description>
