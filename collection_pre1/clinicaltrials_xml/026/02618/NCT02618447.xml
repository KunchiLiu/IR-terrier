	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize 4Dimensional Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( 4D PC MRA ) evaluation portal venous flow predicts underlie liver function hypertrophic potential patient liver cancer present portal vein embolization ( PVE ) . 4D PC MRA may provide non-invasive measure liver function could help determine patient could safely successfully undergo PVE subsequent resection tumor . By compare 4D PC MRA result invasive catheter measurement investigator validate flow finding . Further regression/correlation analysis functional measure liver ( HIDA scan ) , volumetrics , Doppler flow analysis , histology , outcomes help investigator determine ability 4D PC MRA predict functional status hypertrophic potential liver prior PVE hepatectomy allow well patient selection reduce morbidity/mortality .</brief_summary>
