	<brief_title>Lactate Levels During Cardiopulmonary Bypass Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty consecutive pediatric patient require cardiopulmonary bypass repair palliation complex congenital heart disease enrol study . Patients study select convenience sampling , without randomization control surgical procedure , conduct anesthesia , CPB management . Patients monitor intra-operatively use ECG , invasive non-invasive blood pressure monitoring , pulse oximetry capnography determination End Tidal Co2 ( ETCo2 ) nasopharyngeal temperature . After induction anesthesia placement intra-arterial catheter 1 ml arterial blood collect heparinized 3 ml blood gas syringe immediately analyze arterial blood gas analyzer ( GEM Premier 3000 ) blood gas , hematocrit , electrolytes , calcium glucose . Management strategy cardio-pulmonary bypass ( CPB ) standardize patient . Lactate sample draw specific time point within 5 time interval : CPB induction , cool CPB , rewarming CPB , immediately CPB operate room , admission post-operative intensive care unit . Differences lactate level relate diagnosis examine . To examine effect patient diagnosis surgical risk serum lactate level outcome , investigator separate patient surgical risk category Risk adjustment congenital heart surgery ( RACHS-1 ) . This classification include heart transplantation . Patient mortality prevalence postoperative complication 3 surgical risk category relative change lactate examine .</detailed_description>
