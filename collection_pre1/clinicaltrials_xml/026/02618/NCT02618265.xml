	<brief_title>Mobile Terminal Based Management Stroke Secondary Prevention Adminstration Effect Research</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With high incidence , mortality , morbidity recurrence rateï¼Œstroke significant impact national development strategy plan . Improving secondary prevention strongly promote stroke management rapid develop phase Chinese economy expansion health situation . At present lack high-quality medical resource , low medical permeability remedy extensive prevention failure stroke . Mobile healthcare easy conduct still early stage explosive growth . This research group establish open management platform stroke prevention . And collaborate Peking University Institute Information Technology develop smart phone application personalize medication reminder , record medication compliance , home blood pressure blood glucose test result , also provide doctor-patient communication platform symptom alarm . The investigator want verify whether mobile application base stroke strengthen prevention management effective traditional management model open stroke management platform . Whole blood-impedance base platelet aggregation ( WBA ) method VerifyNow detect aspirin clopidogrel responsiveness provide individualize anti-platelet drug selection . Control group select National Stroke data registration database platform open platform stroke prevention . Follow-up period 2 year . Endpoint event define stroke death relapse . Primary measure outcomes change stroke recurrence rate mortality secondary prevention .</detailed_description>
