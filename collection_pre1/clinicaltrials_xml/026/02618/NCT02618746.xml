	<brief_summary>COPD fourth lead cause death world one top five illness whose death rate still increase . It mainly cause smoking . Greece high prevalence death rate COPD many country Europe . The disease incurable treatment aim alleviate symptom slow progression . Despite maximal medication strategy pulmonary rehabilitation home nurse support , many patient remain vulnerable , socially isolated report difficulty access local health service . Research show patient worsen symptoms average three four day admit hospital exacerbation COPD . This suggest window opportunity intervene . Early warning contact via innovative technology may treat symptom earlier , improve patient confidence / quality life simultaneously reduce health care visit admission . However , large gap postulate empirically demonstrate benefit electronic Health Technologies . In addition , lack robust research risk implement technology cost-effectiveness yet demonstrate , despite frequently promote policymakers give issue . In addition , evidence-base telehealth well-reported peer review journal hence continue difficulty experience convincing clinician , hospital manager stakeholder investment technology enable reduction aspect healthcare delivery time . This project attempt provide robust justification effectiveness telerehabilitation implementation randomize control trial blindly assign COPD patient : ) home care telerehabilitation group remotely monitor specialised private health care centre ( Filoktitis - group A ) ii ) hospital-based rehabilitation group manage regular base weekly visit personnel state University rehabilitation centre ( group B ) . iii ) A third group receive usual care ( group C : control group ; i.e . : neither home monitoring hospital base rehabilitation ) also include .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home Rehabilitation Via Telemonitoring Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD important health problem Greece average prevalence COPD people &gt; 35 year old 8.4 % ( i.e . : approximately 350.000 citizen ) ( Tzanakis et al. , 2004 ) . Hospitalization attribute severe exacerbation major cost driver COPD . A study Northern Greece reveal mean actual cost per severe exacerbation COPD €1711 , whilst amount €621 reimburse social security fund ( Geitona et al. , 2011 ) . The observed price discrepancy actual nominal cost per patient , undoubtedly increase public debt especially consider patient severe COPD suffer acute exacerbation twice three time per year . Accordingly , urgent need prevent exacerbation subsequent hospitalization Greece . International evidence support concept telemonitoring key role play systemic improvement healthcare reduce unplanned hospital admission , hospital length stay use health care service , thereby make best use scarce clinical resource empower individual patient . Home telemonitoring chronic lung disease appear promise patient management approach could potentially produce accurate reliable data , empower patient , influence attitude behaviour , improve patient medical condition . However , scientific evidence support home telemonitoring still weak inconsistent , highlight need research , particularly relation patient-level benefit , associate technology . Furthermore , although , economic viability telemonitoring observed study , case in-depth cost-minimization analysis perform ( Casas et al. , 2006 ; Hernandez et al. , 2015 ) . Accordingly , need study accumulate evidence relate interaction clinical effect telemonitoring , cost effectiveness , impact service utilization , acceptance health care provider . The project look sustainability patient telemonitoring service implement private health care enterprise , namely Filoktitis Rehabilitation Centre clinical effectiveness compare long term program hospital-based rehabilitation ( Athens University 1st Department Respiratory Medicine ) require home telemonitoring . The propose strategy allow analysis evaluation reimbursement scheme design appropriate business model . The main idea initially ( 8-weeks ) teach COPD patient techniques self-management improve functional capacity regular exercise training take place two different rehabilitation centre ( one state hospital : Athens University Clinic Respiratory Medicine , one private hospital : Filoktitis Rehabilitation Centre ) subsequently either patient visit State University Hospital twice weekly wellness rehabilitation session regular check clinical condition 12 month case Filoktitis refer patient home live independently whilst remotely monitoring course number vital sign alert physician exacerbation eminent . ( i.e. , prematurely recognize symptom exacerbation ) . The initial 8-week session rehabilitation take place University Hospital Clinic Filoktitis rehabilitation centre , whilst home monitoring implement complete initial 8-week phase Filoktitis Rehabilitation Centre subsequent period 12 month . Patients complete initial 8-week program University Clinic keep visit centre twice weekly 12 month . The ultimate objective project identify , term health status outcome , patient compliance cost effectiveness , whether remote monitoring management patient professional private rehabilitation centre superior involve telemonitoring regular visit University Hospital Clinic . The aim propose project term specific patient outcome measure ( namely annual rate hospital admission due exacerbation exacerbation treat home , emergency room visit , use health care resource , quality life , functional capacity daily level physical activity ) test efficacy wireless system patient 's home self-monitoring service deliver remotely private rehabilitation centre compare close monitoring patient regular visit University Hospital Clinic . The hypothesis test technology knowledge transfer private rehabilitation centre , patient follow-up early prevention exacerbation differ patient control remotely via home telemonitoring service compare management patient centralized Hospital level , since case latter type service difficulty elderly frail patient regularly visit Hospital . Study design : One hundred fifty ( 150 ) clinically stable patient classify GOLD stage II III IV recruit University Hospital Outpatient Clinic Filoktitis Medical Centre . The study conduct randomize control trial blindly assign use set computer-generated random number home care ( group A , Telerehabilitation group : control Filoktitis rehabilitation centre ) group B ( Hospital base Rehabilitation supervise University hospital personnel ) third group receive usual care ( group C , usual care : control group ) . Prior recruitment COPD patient initially complete multidisciplinary intense Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program last 8 week either Filoktitis rehabilitation centre University clinic rehabilitation centre Sotiria Hospital ( 1st Department Respiratory Medicine ) improve functional capacity quality life . Thereafter patient assign group A ( n = 50 ) monitor home 12 month Group B ( n= 50 ) follow University clinic professional twice weekly visit hospital schedule 12 month undertake physiotherapy , dietary psychological advice exercise training session . The control group ( C : = 50 patient ) follow usual care treatment involve maintenance hospital rehabilitation session home telemonitoring vital sign . The home care/rehabilitative program include follow component : ) individualize action plan ; b ) educational session self management ; c ) physical exercise session remote monitoring ; ) access call centre ; e ) professional monthly home visit physiotherapist , dietician physician remote connection response possible incident ; f ) remote monitor selectively temporarily . The home care program perform staff employ Filoktitis rehabilitation centre . Study protocol : On daily basis , patient recruit home care program ( Telerehabilitation , group A ) take one vital sign measurement use wireless device home . They may also manually enter measurement tablet . Results automatically transmit tablet ( via mobile communication network ) secure web-based server platform , in-home communication device also prompt patient answer clinician-directed health risk assessment survey question . A care management team base Filoktitis ( nurse physician ) review patient 's information web-based clinical review platform , send alert patient 's doctor vital sign measurement survey response fall outside establish limit . In addition monitoring tell-tale symptom decline - abnormal weight gain , increase blood pressure , shortness breath , fatigue , oedema , fever , cough - system also trigger automated health assessment . Patients group A also give task exercise regularly home well remotely provide dietary psychological advice . Patients assign hospital base rehabilitation program ( group B ) visit hospital twice weekly 12 month order participate multidisciplinary rehabilitation program include exercise , physiotherapy dietary psychological advice staff rehabilitation centre base University clinic . Outcomes assess 12 month follow 3 group : ) state health evaluate standardised questionnaire ; ii ) number emergency room visit unscheduled hospital admission due cause ; iii ) annual rate admit day ; iv ) functional capacity ) ; v ) daily symptom ; vi ) daily physical activity ; vii ) health-related quality life . Frequency assessment : outcome assess baseline ( prior join initial 8 week rehabilitation program ) , 6 month 12 month follow completion initial 8-weeks rehabilitation program .</detailed_description>
