	<brief_title>The Andromeda Study.Predictive Value Combined Criteria Tailor Breast Cancer Screening .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer ( BC ) represent frequent neoplasm woman worldwide . In Italy 1 3 malignant cancer woman ( 29 % ) BC ( leave cutaneous tumour ) report Italian cancer registry 2006 2009 . Results randomized trial , summarize updated review meta-analysis U.S. Preventive Task Force Nelson et al. , show participate mammography screen program reduces BC mortality 14-32 % , depend age range . In Italy , mammography screen early diagnosis implement regional basis several Italian area . In compliance national international guideline , programme invite woman age 50 69 year undergo mammography every two year . Although mammography become standard care BC screening , limitation well recognize ( overdiagnosis , use ionizing radiation , poor accuracy woman dense breast tissue , relatively high rate false positive , personal discomfort ) . In addition , current screening protocol base woman 's age , ignore risk factor define single screening periodicity within prespecified age range . Current challenge management BC include search sensitive specific minimally invasive biomarkers associate early neoplastic change . A number circulate tumour marker ( carcino-embryonic antigen , CEA carbohydrate antigen 15-3 , CA 15-3 ) widely use BC handling , sensitivity low . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) small , noncoding RNAs ( 18-25 nucleotide long ) , regulate gene expression inside cell degrade mRNA inhibit protein synthesis . Since may hundreds target , able control several biological process inside cell . There grow evidence miRNAs may also release outside cell , increased level miRNAs release tumour microenvironment well decrease physiologic circulate miRNA level already detect serum/plasma cancer patient . The potential use molecule diagnostic/prognostic purpose regard breast cancer extensively evaluate stability body fluid open new opportunity anticipate BC diagnosis , minimally invasive intervention especially woman high risk . Hypothesis : Risk-based screening programme accord different BC risk criterion ( i.e . breast density , model base estimate absolute risk , life-style ) may maximize impact screen group woman characterize different risk . Gathering data risk stratification population base screen programme require large amount resource . Non independent criterion identify woman high risk redundant consider mutually exclusive . Validated highly accurate blood molecular biomarkers associate BC risk may represent complementary tool mammography primary screen setting . The first objective study evaluate compare , large cohort woman , predictive value available criterion define BC risk order identify appropriate risk-based stratification personalise screen . The criterion consider : i. general risk factor collect standardised risk questionnaire ( e.g . reproductive factor , first-degree family history , biopsy history , physical activity , BMI alcohol consumption ) . For category absolute risk evaluate use risk prediction model Petracci et al . developed Italian population validate independent cohort Italian woman . ii . breast density ; iii.woman 's life style ( detailed questionnaire dietary habit physical activity ) . The study design achieve follow secondary aim relate first objective : To measure age- risk-specific screening performance indicator ( i.e . detection rate , recall rate benign/malignant surgical biopsy ratio ) . To quantify impact potential intervention tailor screen health outcome cost knowledge risk factor distribution target population ; To evaluate economic organizational feasibility potential tailor intervention design stratify breast cancer screen strategy future pilot screen programme implementation ; The extension follow beyond three-year duration project allow u determine even consistent estimate predictive value abovementioned evaluate criteria/risk factor consider study multivariate analysis . The second main objective investigate whether select circulate miRNAs previously find associate BC risk significantly alter plasma cancer patient compare match healthy control satisfy pre-specified true- false-positive rate consider minimally acceptable screen set . Related sub-objectives : - ass association factor age , breast density , reproductive factor family history well life-style miRNA level cancer-free population . If factor affect biomarker , threshold screen positivity may need define separately screen subpopulation , order keep false-positive rate low level . - To assess factor associate miRNA level cancer case - particular , disease characteristic stage , grade , available prognostic factor . Understanding nature cancer detect biomarker key issue . A biomarker detect cancer early stage valuable preventive purpose one detect late-stage cancer . - evaluate presence 18 currently establish breast cancer risk SNPs obtain genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) identify common low penetrance allele associate breast cancer risk multiple genetic locus , test association circulate miRNAs , breast density screen outcome . Phase 1 - Enrolment About 36 600 woman ( age-range : 46-67 year ) participate BC screen program select area , offer participation Andromeda study , 22 000 expect provide inform consent . At enrolment information BC risk factor life-style collect , together breast density blood sample serum , plasma buffy-coat storing . Women agree participate Andromeda ask fill questionnaire design BC standard risk detail questionnaire life style . They also ask provide blood sample . Furthermore , breast density calculate breast examination . Exams read two expert radiologist breast density classify category mean Breast Imaging Reporting Data System ( BI-RADS ) . Women accept blood sample receive specific appointment trained personnel , beyond blood withdrawal , collect anthropometric measure support complete study 's questionnaire , need . Given positivity dense breast , Gail score , lifestyle relate risk miRNA determine subject , efficient estimate ratio relative ( positive vs. negative ) positive predictive value ( PPV ) ratios two different factor give x b/c x , = cancer positive factor 1 factor 2 ; b= woman abnormal mammography cancer , positive factor 2 factor 1 ; c=cancers positive factor 2 factor 1 ; d= woman abnormal mammography cancer , positive factor 1 factor 2 . Assuming 40 % 21000 enrolled woman dense breast , 20 % certain Gail score , 50 % lifestyle risk 20 % give miRNA , 11 % study woman carry breast cancer overall PPV mammography 20 % , 100-120 discordant cancer 640-740 discordant woman abnormal mammography cancer expect consider couple factor . Under assumption , study 80 % power reject ( alpha = 0.05 ) null hypothesis relative PPV ratio =1 true value least 1.8-2.0 , depend couple factor consider . Phase 2 - Biomarkers analysis The Andromeda study comprise molecular analysis evaluate SNPs circulate miRNAs perform blindly appropriate case-control sample extract cohort woman enrol , soon minimum number BC case reach . Blinding allow avoid knowledge subject 's outcome status affect interpretation assay result care specimen handle . Genomic DNA extract buffy coat High Pure PCR Template preparation kit . 18 SNPs amplify PCR evaluate qPCR apparatus specific assay . The 18 breast cancer risk relate SNPs : rs11249433 , rs1045485 , rs13387042 , rs4973768 , rs10941679 , rs889312 , rs2046210 , rs13281615 , rs1011970 , rs2981582 , rs2380205 , rs10995190 , rs704010 , rs3817198 , rs614367 , rs999737 , rs3803662 rs6504950 . Circulating total RNA extraction plasma sample carry miRNeasy minikit accord Exiqon protocol , imply use RNA carrier ( batteriofage MS2 RNA , Roche Diagnostics ) promote RNA precipitation purification membrane . Cel-miR-139 use spike-in control check extraction yield normalize data , together hasmiR- 1228 . RNA sample elute nuclease free water store -80° C. A novel method check haemolysis apply . To calculate sample size necessary pivotal evaluation biomarkers ( express continuous scale ) , minimally acceptable desirable level typical performance measure interest , true-positive rate ( TPR ) false-positive rate ( FPR ) define . For general population screening , false-positive rate must quite low avoid huge number people undergoing unnecessary costly medical procedure . Thus , hypothesize maximally acceptable false-positive rate ( FPR0 ) 4 % ( minimally acceptable specificity therefore 96 % ) minimally acceptable sensitivity 80 % ( TPR0 ) . The null hypothesis reject follow : H0 : TPR0≤0.80 FPR0≥0.04 . The sample size require 80 % power ( alpha=5 % ) assume desirable true-positive rate false-positive rate TPR1=0.90 FPR1=0.05 , respectively , 179 case 537 control . Sample size computation base theoretically ROC curve . Assuming annual BC detection rate ( DR ) 0.006 first year 0.005 second year study ( therefore biennial DR consider 0.011 ) total 233 case patient first two year study expect observed , thus exceed 179 require . These estimate base DRs observe previous year center consider study . Thus , molecular analysis perform 233 case 699 matched control . For case , three control subject select cohort woman , basis follow criterion : history cancer , similar age enrolment ( within 5 year ) , similar race , availability blood sample , similar date blood draw .</detailed_description>
