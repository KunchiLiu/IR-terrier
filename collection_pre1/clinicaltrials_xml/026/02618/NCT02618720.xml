	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) major cause nosocomial infection surgical patient , high rate report ( range 15 % 30 % ) colorectal surgery . SSI independent predictor postoperative mortality associate longer hospital stay , 5-fold likelihood postoperative readmission 2- 3-fold increase cost care . Given high prevalence financial burden associate SSI , American European guideline issue provide evidenced-based recommendation prevention postoperative SSI . However , prevalence SSI remain high despite adherence guideline application evidence-based preventive measure . Risk factor SSI , whether modifiable , mainly related patient condition ( include age , severe comorbidity , diabetes , nutritional status , steroid use , smoking , immunosuppression ) and/or surgical procedure ( especially surgical duration skin disinfection ) . The prevention SSI consist several individual measure , antibiotic prophylaxis cover aerobic anaerobic bacteria highly recommend patient schedule elective colorectal resection , French European guideline recommend administration intravenous cephalosporin within 30 minute surgical incision . Recent data retrospective study two meta-analyses clinical trial provide compelling argument oral antibiotic administration surgery addition conventional intravenous prophylaxis may useful reduce almost 75 % incidence SSI ( relative risk 0.55 [ CI95 % : 0.41 0.74 ] ) elective colorectal cancer surgery . However , study limitation preclude extrapolation data routine care , especially : 1. prolonged duration intravenous antibiotic administration , longer recommend elective surgery ; 2. use antibiotic oral prophylaxis whose availability limit ; 3. study focus specifically colorectal resection ; 4. study include enhanced recovery surgery ( ERAS ) program , find improve outcome follow colorectal surgery , 5. study use mechanical bowel preparation , longer recommend colonic surgery issue still remain open rectal surgery . Investigators hypothesize oral antibiotic prophylaxis use ornidazole , spectrum activity extend anaerobic bacteria whose pharmacokinetic profile allow single administration day surgery , addition intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis could effective intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis alone use cephalosporin reduce incidence SSI elective colorectal surgery . Given number patient operate colorectal surgery year , study significant clinical importance</detailed_description>
