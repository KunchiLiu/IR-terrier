	<brief_summary>Laceration repair cause significant anxiety child . As open wound account 21-25 % injury child present emergency department , management anxiety great importance . Anxiety often lead poor patient cooperation use potentially excessive physical restraint . High rate procedural anxiety also correlate increased rate negative behaviour discharge . The current standard care suture closure laceration throughout Canada provide local analgesia . The literature therefore focus find anxiolytic adjunct local analgesia . Midazolam ideal adjunct due fast onset short duration action excellent safety profile . The advantage IN route le pain administration compare IV IM rout , increase acceptability compare rectal route old child . Oral midazolam also poor palatability . While onset INM 5-10 minute , duration 20-40 minute make ideal candidate anxiolysis ED use limit common side effect nasal irritation , burn lacrimation administer droplet form . The recent development mucosal atomization device ( MAD ) resolve issue deliver 30-Î¼ particle nasal mucosa . Previous study investigate use INM laceration repair pediatric ED demonstrate INM safe use non-validated measurement tool assess anxiety facilitation . Only one study use atomized INM , retrospectively examine safety primary outcome . The author report excellent safety profile INM use mucosal atomization device MAD-300 ( Wolfe Tory Medical Inc. ) . The use atomize INM anxiolysis pediatric laceration repair evaluate prospectively . Most study focus preschool age child ( &lt; 6 year ) . While study demonstrate prevalence procedural anxiety high young child , 51 % child age 7-12 year experience high level procedural distress . The effectiveness INM pre-adolescent age group , therefore , yet determine . It hypothesize INM reduce anxiety child age 2-12 year undergoing laceration repair facilitate successful completion suture physician .</brief_summary>
