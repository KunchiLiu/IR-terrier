	<detailed_description>Nausea common symptom encounter Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) environment often treat oral intravenous anti-emetic medication . Post operative patient modern anesthesia technique process still 20-30 % incidence Nausea and/or vomit . Nausea complicate symptom though arise vomit center lateral reticular formation brainstem . Afferent input form cerebellum , high cortical center , vestibular apparatus , glossopharyngeal nerve vagal nerve input contribute process perception nausea . Chemoreceptors Chemoreceptor Trigger Zone ( CTZ ) locate brain surface highly vascularized lead increased exposure neurotransmitter Serotonin ( 5-HT-3 ) , histamine ( H1 ) acetylcholine dopamine . Blocking neurotransmitter stimulation target medication antihistamine 5-HT-3 antagonist Ondansetron . Nausea common symptom encounter Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) environment often treat oral intravenous anti-emetic medication . Many patient respond well therapy , EMS service basic life support ( BLS ) capability may good treatment currently . Additionally , configuration modern day ambulance , patient transport rear face position patient compartment limited view environment . This method transport frequently cause motion sickness . Motion sickness think cause inadequate adaption body conflict vestibular , visual , proprioceptive input inhibition vestibular cerebellum . Common therapy may include antihistamine , benzodiazepine , tricyclic antidepressant scopolamine . Behavioral strategy watch true horizon , steer vehicle , tilt head turn lay eye close show alleviate symptom motion sickness . But strategies available EMS environment . Scopolamine administer well motion stimulus show prevent motion sickness acute treatment best use sedate antihistamine . Non-sedating antihistamine , Ondansetron ginger root find effectively prevent treat motion sickness . Multiple agent study treatment nausea emergency department equivalency effect time onset . Common agent include ondansetron , metoclopramide , promethazine prochlorperazine . Such agent also use EMS environment degree , require parenteral administration exposure risk side effect sedation . There also option BLS level . Post-operative oxygen therapy show decrease post nausea c-section delivery disappoint ubiquitous therapy EMS environment care , inexpensive easy administer . Ondansetron show safe effective prehospital environment low incidence side effect cost need parenteral administration often barrier care . Multiple study show Isopropyl Alcohol ( IPA ) 70 % aromatherapy effective Ondansetron rapid onset nausea relief . This therapy perform hold fold saturate 70 % IPA pad naris patient inhale vapor . The patient simply instruct take three deep breath nose . In animal experiment , toxicity inhalation IPA low dos allowable inhalation compare dermal oral ingestion . Dermal application IPA routinely use EMS personnel cleanse area skin immediately surround insertion point intravascular catheter medication administration , blood draw . PURPOSE : IPA Therapy may offer inexpensive , easy administer , effective alternative medication therapy nausea vomit prehospital . RECRUITMENT AND RANDOMIZATION PROCESS Patients report nausea and/or vomit normal evaluation care call 911 Emergency Medical Care offer enrollment study . A short script attach outside study packet provide information study risk benefit . Verbal write ( waiver inform consent request ) permission obtain start randomization . If patient agrees enroll study packet open utilized . PROCEDURES AND LOGISTICS All Advanced Life Support Ambulances San Antonio Fire Department seal numbered opaque box envelop either : - Three large 2 ply 70 % Isopropyl Alcohol swab OR - Ondansetron ( Zofran ) 4mg IV/IM use These study packet similar weight , shape contour despite content . If need , prop may include make package similar weight , contour sound shaken reveal true content . The goal enroll least 400 patient 1 year period . For arm , package contain step step instruction checklist . Six Visual Nausea Severity Scoring card provide mark pen record time nausea level upon arrival Emergency Department 15 minute treatment whichever come first . The treatment protocol arm : 70 % Isopropyl Alcohol 1 . Mark Time Visual Nausea Severity Score 0-10 2 . Remove alcohol prep gloved hand 3 . Place nares patient 4 . Instruct patient take three separate deep inhalation Isopropyl vapor nose 5 . Record time treatment back first Visual Nausea Severity Score card . 6 . Mark time Subsequent Visual Nausea Severity Scores upon arrival Emergency Department indicate time interval . 7 . If patient still significant nausea vomit ten minute provide rescue Ondansetron therapy 4mg Ondansetron slow IV push IM 8 . Mark time Visual Nausea Severity Score upon arrival Emergency Department third card . 9 . Document interventions electronic Patient Care record per usual procedure . 10 . Complete Paramedic evaluation tool . 11 . Envelope box , Consent , score card Paramedic evaluation tool return Medic Officer duty new study packet replace . 12 . Used Study Packets collect Investigators Ondansetron 4mg IV/IM ( standard care ) 1 . Mark Time Visual Nausea Severity Score 0-10 first enclose card . 2 . Start IV already do . 3 . If unable obtain IV access two attempt use intramuscular route . 4 . Inject 4mg Ondansetron slow IV push IM . 5 . Record time treatment back first Visual Nausea Severity Score card . 6 . Mark time Second Visual Nausea Severity Score upon arrival Emergency Department 10 minute treatment whichever come first . 7 . If patient still significant nausea vomit ten minute provide rescue additional dose Ondansetron therapy 4mg Ondansetron slow IV push IM 8 . Mark time Visual Nausea Severity Score upon arrival Emergency Department third card . 9 . Document interventions electronic Patient Care record per usual procedure . 10 . Complete Paramedic evaluation tool . 11 . Envelope box , Consent , score card Paramedic evaluation tool return Medic Officer duty new study packet replace . 12 . Used Study Packets collect Investigators . Data Analysis Plan : A secure excel spreadsheet tool use abstract data research data collection document EMS electronic patient care record . The patient identify randomization number , incident number , age ( great 89 age indicate &lt; 89 year ) , sex date service database study packet material . All relevant time interval Visual Nausea Severity Scores record enrolled patient . Time treatment compare two arm study well change Visual Nausea Severity Scores . Treatment failures require additional Ondansetron characterized . Paramedic ask evaluate treatment provide ease use , time need complete treatment impression effectiveness assign treatment . T-test confidence interval utilized determine statistical significance .</detailed_description>
