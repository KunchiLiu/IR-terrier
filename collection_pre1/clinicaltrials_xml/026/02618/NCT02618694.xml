	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Posterior Retroperitoneoscopic Adrenalectomy : A Comparative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim study : To upgrade urosurgical care level candidate surgical adrenalectomy due adrenal disease , increase efficacy procedure shorten operative time duration hospital stay convalescence . Study Objective : Comparing safety efficacy posterior retroperitoneoscopic versus anterior transperitoneal adrenalectomy , regard operative time , estimate intraoperative blood loss , day postoperative hospital stay , rate complication . Study Question : Can posterior retroperitoneoscopic approach provide good alternative anterior laparoscopic approach term effectiveness safety laparoscopic adrenalectomy ? Study Hypothesis : Investigators suggest posterior retroperitoneoscopic approach safe effective alternative anterior transperitoneal approach adrenalectomy less operative time , estimate blood loss , postoperative day hospitalization rate complication . Significance Relevance : This study suspect beneficial urologist oncology surgeon , select effective intervention patient adrenal disease . Study setting : The study carry one year start 4/2015 5/2016 , include operation data management . Operative procedure carry Urology Departments Suez Canal , Alexandria University hospital . Study population The study focus patient adrenal disease indicate adrenalectomy . The sample frame include patient age , gender body weight , fair cognitive function , candidate simple laparoscopic adrenalectomy Suez Canal University Hospital Alexandria University Hospital . Inclusion exclusion criterion mention Eligibility section . Sampling : A non-probability convenience sample take . That case present referred urology clinic diagnose adrenal mass hyperplasia candidate laparoscopic adrenalectomy . The sample size calculate compare mean value two independent group equal size possibility two way outcome . The sample size 20 case , randomly divide 10 case group . Work plan : The main objective study compare data relate obtain two laparoscopic approach order ass efficacy one determine statistic evidence prefer one . This goal could achieve follow step . First , patient evaluation ; urology clinic university hospital Suez Canal Alexandria Universities . It also include patient refer related clinic oncosurgery , gynecology , endocrinology cardiology clinic . History taking , full clinical examination do . Laboratory investigation request accord provisional clinical diagnosis . Imaging study do confirm final diagnosis determine treatment plan . Second , case indicate fit laparoscopic adrenalectomy , case fulfill inclusion criterion study , patient get study number randomly assign operative approach . Third phase study postoperative follow . The patient follow month . Parameters include postoperative day full diet , day mobilization , day discharge day full recovery . Also postoperative pain score scar cosmetic outcome include . Instruments : The theatre room prepare laparoscopic procedure : charge-coupled device video camera , video monitor , Xenon light source , high frequency generator suction irrigation device . Laparoscopic surgery depend five main step . Insufflation use CO2 high flow insufflator . This step involve 2 technique ; close technique Veress needle transperitoneal access ; open Hasson technique . Trocar insertion include multiport type , open close technique , retroperitoneal transperitoneal . Dissection abdominal plane need endoscopic curve scissors without rotatable blade , endoscopic curve dissectors suction irrigation probe . Also procedure may include sharp dissection endoshears blunt dissection endo-peanuts , right angle dissector . Upon heamostasis basic instrument : 5 mm monopolar coagulation forceps/dissector , 5 mm bipolar forceps , 10 mm endoclip applicator endoscopic stapler . LigaSure™ blunt dissection heamostasis . Endoscopic needle holder short thread small needle need suturing . Finally , LapSac™ best test bag retrieval specimen . The data patient preoperative postoperative parameter collect questionnaire design purpose study . It also include traditional numerical rating scale visual analogue scale assessment postoperative pain . The patient satisfaction scar assess three questionnaire ; body image questionnaire , photo series questionnaire future surgical procedure preference questionnaire . Variables : For case data include demographic data patient medical surgical history . This include age , gender , body mass index calculate kg/square meter . The side affect gland play role operative time , determination side compute tomography ( CT ) essential . Also size adrenal mass CT clinical diagnosis regard function possibility malignancy also consider main independent variable . A significant independent variable surgeon 's experience . The number type procedures do operator rate cause conversion include case . Dependent variable include full operative data case . Starting indication intervention rationale preference laparoscopic approach eventually cause conversion need . This study focus operative time minute ; total time first abdominal incision last suture , time elapse identify adrenal vein , critical step operation . The study also interested compare estimate blood loss measure milliliter correlation type tumor , patient operative variable . On postoperative phase , data gather include number day full diet , post-operative hospital stay complete recovery ; i.e . return usual daily activity . The patient achieve score assessment postoperative pain assessment cosmotic outcome incision . The rate short term complication postoperatively assess group classify Clavien-Dindo system . Statistical Analysis : This include data management coding . The data entry via SPSS™ Microsoft™ Excel™ . Mainly comparison study variable via detect significance difference mean value group parameter . Finally , data arrange table graphs present conclude finding study . Ethical consideration : All patient inform participation train course urology trainee part consent admission get surgical intervention authorize teaching hospital . However , participant offer informed consent include comparative study . The patient receive ideal best line treatment accord late guideline available facility whatever response consent . The risk complication intervention comparable participant chance either transperitoneal posterior retroperitoneal approach . To avoid bias , patient assign randomly two study group . At hand , patient 's data involve study treat confidentially . Budget : This study fund researcher 's financial resource . That include transportation fee , paper work audio-video utility . Cases do Suez Canal University Hospital may afford college hospital fund . This include admission , rent laparoscopic set associate medication .</detailed_description>
