	<brief_summary>This single center single arm study 50 patient 1 ) determine safety tranexamic acid chronic subdural hematoma population follow surgical drainage chronic subdural hematoma 2 ) determine use oral tranexamic acid reduces rate ipsilateral recurrence follow drainage chronic subdural hematoma . This compare historical control . This study intend prerequisite large nationally funded randomize control trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Safety Tranexamic Acid Chronic Subdural Hematoma Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic subdural hematoma common problem face neurosurgery annual incidence 13.5/100,00 person per year 58/100,000 65 year old population . Their treatment often complicate recurrence rate report high 33 % . Currently good strategy help avoid problem , add significantly patient morbidity . The pathogenesis problem believe related propensity associate neo-membranes bleed . It show label red blood cell bleed continue occur hematoma cavity . It also show high level tissue plasminogen activator outer membrane chronic subdural hematoma . It find ratio tissue plasminogen activator plasminogen activator inhibitor contribute pathogenesis . It also show chronic subdural hematoma high level fibrin degradation product addition mark breakdown fibrin antihemostatic enhance tissue plasminogen activator activity , antithrombin affect inhibit platelet aggregation fibrin polymerization . Essentially , scenario ongoing hemorrhage repeat clot formation hyperfibrinolysis lead expansion recurrence chronic subdural hematoma . Given importance plasmin hyperfibrinolysis pathophysiology chronic subdural hematoma , interrupt action vicious cycle propagate seem ideal therapeutic target . Tranexamic acid synthetic lysine amino acid derivative . It bind fibrin bind site plasmin plasminogen prevents interaction degradation fibrin . This effect neo-membranes chronic subdural hematoma prevent rebleeding reaccumulation subdural hematoma . Tranexamic acid show safe effective reduce blood loss transfusion number type surgery , reduce mortality need urgent surgery patient GI bleeding , reduce bleeding associate menorrhagia pregnancy . Adverse effect generally mild . Thought theoretical increase risk thromboembolic complication , multiple randomize controlled trial show increased risk . Furthermore , study 3000 gynecologic patient use tranexamic acid , thromboembolic complication . This likely tranexamic acid show effect plasminogen vein wall .</detailed_description>
