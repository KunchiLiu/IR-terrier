	<detailed_description>Tickborne Diseases ( TBDs ) spread throughout many country region . In recent year , incidence tendency rise continuously . The clinical symptom laboratory feature tick-borne disease always specific , diagnostic method available , observe pathogen cultivation method Gimenez、serological test antibody always ca n't make timely diagnosis , especially early period disease . The development polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) apply pathogen detection , show high sensitivity specificity , may contribute early diagnose，but standardize method PCR yet propose . This study mean explore several laboratory diagnosis find helpful make accurate diagnosis early period TBDs .</detailed_description>
