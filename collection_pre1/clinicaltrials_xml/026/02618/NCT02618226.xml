	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) public health problem epidemic proportion United States ( US ) India . Trauma estimate lead cause death age group 20-40 year India account 2-3 % loss gross domestic product ( GDP ) every year . The incidence TBI India among high world rapidly rise along rapid increase automobile density . Compared United States , poor outcomes report follow TBI India attribute several factor include underdeveloped pre-hospital care , problem transport appropriate medical attention , limited availability center trauma care , lack appropriate training expertise lack application standard TBI care widely accept developed world . Over last two decade management TBI US Europe center guideline develop Brain Trauma Foundation ( BTF ) . Severe TBI , define Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 8 , carry bad prognosis , mortality 30-40 % report India compare 10-20 % US . Monitoring Intracranial Pressure ( ICP ) integral part management severe TBI , BTF recommend monitor ICP appropriate candidate maintenance ICP &lt; 20-25mmHg use range therapeutic option . The rationale recommendation lie fact ICP &gt; 20mmHg associated clinical neurological decline Cerebral Perfusion Pressure [ Mean Arterial Pressure ( MAP ) - ICP ] &lt; 50mmHg associated bad neurological outcome . Importantly , study examine TBI demonstrate increase 2-week mortality non-use ICP monitoring . Moreover adherence guideline management ICP , include treatment ICP &gt; 25mmHg , associate significant decline mortality New York state . While widely accept standard care US , invasive ICP consider standard care develop world . Rather , clinical equipoise consider exist best way measure ICP region . A randomized control trial perform Bolivia Ecuador compare invasive ICP monitoring-based management protocol management protocol without invasive monitoring demonstrate difference neurological outcome . While trial may confound , important difference intervention arm , illustrate fact invasive monitoring current standard care develop world . While appropriate role indication invasive ICP monitor develop world may matter debate , strong association appropriate ICP management mortality observe study suggest urgent , unmet need exist low-cost , low-risk , non-invasive , point-of-care alternative invasive monitoring detection life-threatening increase ICP follow TBI . While need tool may greatest develop world , invasive monitoring mostly unavailable , validate non-invasive ICP monitor would also great value US , potentially decrease risk intracranial placement well cost invasive monitoring . While Optic Nerve Ultrasound ( ONUS ) promise noninvasive tool detection life threaten intracranial hypertension , neither continuous quantitative measure ICP unlikely entirely replace invasive monitoring . The great potential value noninvasive diagnostic tool ONUS may function screen tool permit early initiation life-saving treatment measure decrease burden risk expense associate invasive monitoring . As screen tool sensitivity detection intracranial hypertension need high , moderate specificity may acceptable , since noninvasive measurement suggest increase likelihood elevate ICP likely lead placement invasive ICP monitor follow response therapeutic intervention . Early identification patient risk death elevate ICP use noninvasive assessment tool may permit provider initiate treatment earlier target limited resource toward high-risk individual . Objective : Aim 1 : To determine optimal optic nerve sheath diameter ( ONSD ) measurement detection raise intracranial pressure ( ICP ) Indian patient use Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve , emphasis cut-off high sensitivity acceptable specificity , appropriate screening tool . Hypothesis- An ONSD threshold identify maximize true positive rate ( &gt; 0.98 ) acceptable specificity ( &gt; 80 % ) detection elevate ICP ( &gt; 25mmHg ) . Aim 2 : To evaluate whether optic nerve sheath diameter predict Therapeutic Intensity Level , in-hospital mortality discharge functional outcome follow severe traumatic brain injury . Hypothesis- The high measured optic nerve sheath diameter within first 48 hour patient TBI associate Therapeutic Intensity Level , mortality hospitalization discharge functional outcome . Study setting : The Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center ( JPNATC ) All India Institute Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) , New Delhi , apex referral center TBI New Delhi well much rest country . It 30 triage 36 ICU bed , 300-600 severe TBI admission every year .</detailed_description>
