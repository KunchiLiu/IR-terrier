	<brief_title>Early Endoscopy Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiplatelet therapy cornerstone management patient ACS . Aspirin interfere platelet aggregation activity decrease thromboxane synthesis inhibition cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) enzymes . Low-dose ( 75-325mg/day ) aspirin demonstrate reduce risk cardio-and cerebro-vascular event much 30 % , 18 % all-cause mortality secondary prevention cardiovascular disease . However , aspirin notorious GI adverse effect inhibition COX-mediated prostaglandin synthesis . Up 60 % aspirin user develop GI mucosal lesion endoscopic examination , especially stomach duodenum . The risk serious ulcer complication , include life-threatening bleeding perforation , two- fourfold high patient take low-dose aspirin placebo . Clopidogrel , another antiplatelet agent , inhibit platelet function block adenosine diphosphate receptor platelet rather suppress COX activity . The CAPRIE trial show long-term clopidogrel monotherapy effective well tolerate aspirin reducing combine risk ischaemic stroke , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , vascular death . Clopidogrel seem associate few GI adverse effect compare aspirin . Nonetheless , animal study reveal clopidogrel impair heal gastric ulcer suppress release platelet-derived growth factor crucial repair mucosal defect . Clinical study also disclose 8-12 % clopidogrel user history peptic ulcer bleed develop recurrent GI bleeding within 12 month . A nationwide population-based study demonstrate use clopidogrel increase risk UGI bleed hazard ratio ( HR ) 3.66 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 2.96-4.51 ] , especially elderly , chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , past history peptic ulcer disease , concomitant use aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . The combined use aspirin clopidogrel become mainstay therapy patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The dual antiplatelet therapy show reduce risk death , MI stroke much 27 % patient PCI . Inevitably , GI bleed still major complication dual antiplatelet therapy MI patient associate long hospital stay high mortality rate ( 18.5~44 % vs. 2.4~13 % ) . An investigation 1,368 MI patient underwent PCI show incidence rate in-hospital UGI bleed 8.9 % . In CURE study , overall incidence bleed complication 8.5 % , commonly occur GI tract ( major GI tract bleed incidence 1.3 % ) . In patient dual antiplatelet therapy , ACS carry high risk UGI bleed early stage ( ≦2 week ) HR 2.67 ( 95 % CI 1.33-5.34 ) . GIB strongly associate 30-day all-cause mortality ( hazard ratio [ HR ] : 4.87 , p &lt; 0.0001 ) , cardiac mortality ( HR : 5.35 , p &lt; 0.0001 ) , composite ischemia ( HR : 1.94 , p=0.014 ) , well 1-year all-cause mortality ( HR : 3.97 , p &lt; 0.0001 ) , cardiac mortality ( HR : 3.77 , p &lt; 0.0001 ) , MI ( HR : 1.74 , p=0.047 ) , composite ischemia ( HR : 1.9 , p=0.0001 ) . Patients experience GIB significantly high rate stent thrombosis compare patient without GIB ( 5.8 % vs. 2.4 % , p=0.009 ) . Therefore , deal acute UGI bleeding set recent ACS still challenge gastroenterologist cardiologist . Acute UGI bleeding remain therapeutic challenge significant morbidity mortality . Pharmacological therapy proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) therapeutic endoscopy use various modality clearly show significantly reduce re-bleeding , need surgery mortality patient acute UGI bleeding . Early endoscopy ( within 24 hour ) recommend medium high risk patient acute UGI bleeding . Early endoscopic intervention allow early diagnosis early discharge patient low risk finding , provide endoscopic hemostasis , enable complete risk stratification non-variceal bleeding , result less transfusion requirement length hospitalization . However , despite many benefit early endoscopy , study able demonstrate strategy lead reduction mortality acute UGI bleeding ; probably due mortality acute UGI bleed mainly determine co-morbidity rather control hemorrhage . Moreover , endoscopy carry certain potential risk complication , include cardiopulmonary event , infectious thromboembolic event , bleeding , instrumental ( perforation , penetration impaction ) , drug reaction . Whether early endoscopic intervention hemostasis UGI bleed improves outcomes patient recent ACS still debate . In patient recent ACS , safety timing endoscopy well know . Dynamic change infarct size may occur since loss viable myocardium progressive coronary artery occlusion several hour . In addition , infarcted region critical determinant remodeling , incidence arrhythmia , sudden cardiac death thus prognosis ACS , may expand contract ; moreover , normal collagen structure disappear first week even loss viable myocardium terminate . Therefore , endoscopy within first week MI seem associate high risk cardiovascular event . Nonetheless , several observational cohort retrospective study , endoscopy post-ACS patient describe relatively acceptable complication rate range 1 % 48.4 % , depend definition complication , time endoscopy , clinical condition enrol patients.A systemic review literature show overall complication rate esophagogastroduodenoscopy MI 1 % 8 % , large predominance minor complication . Women seem experience periprocedural myocardial ischemia men ( 31 % vs. 11 % , p=.058 ) ,35 ACS patient ill ( Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation [ APACHE ] II score ≧ 16 ) likely develop endoscopic complication relatively stable condition ( APACHE II &lt; 16 ) ( 21 % vs. 2 % ) . Another recent retrospective study also reveal patient APACHE II score &gt; 16 experience minor complication ( chest pain , abnormal vital sign , minor arrhythmia ) score ≦15 ( 54.5 % vs. 24.2 % , p=.02 ) . However , design study mostly retrospective observational . Given lack guideline randomize control trial , gastroenterologist always reluctant perform early endoscopy UGI bleeding ACS patient fear potential risk complication . In study , investigator evaluate safety efficacy `` early endoscopy '' `` non-endoscopic treatment '' acute UGI bleeding recent ACS patient .</detailed_description>
