	<brief_title>Antispasmodic Drug Diagnosis Proximal Tubal Occlusion Hysterosalpingography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infertility common gynecologic problem reproductive medicine . The cause female infertile divide ovulatory dysfunction , tubal pelvic pathology , unexplained infertility unusual problem . About 30-35 % case infertility cause tubal factor tubal disease important cause infertility specifically exclude ( 1 ) . Methods evaluation fallopian tube pathology include Hysterosalpingography ( HSG ) , Saline infusion sonography ( SIS ) Laparoscopy chromopertubation etc ( 2-3 ) . Laparoscopy chromopertubation consider definitive test evaluate tubal disease allow detection intraabdominal cause infertility . However , laparoscopy expensive , time consuming , limited center , unpleasant patient . More importantly many patient anesthetic surgical complication require hospital admission ( 4 ) . Therefore , HSG commonly use routine screening infertility evaluation tubal patency . It simple , noninvasive inexpensive technique . HSG standard first-line test evaluate tubal patency ( 5-7 ) . HSG X-ray procedure use view inside uterus fallopian tube . HSG investigate tubal patency moderate sensitivity 65 % excellent specificity 83 % infertile population . The PPV NPV HSG 38 % 94 % , respectively ( 8-9 ) . However , false positive diagnosis HSG indicate occlusion , may good chance 60 % tube actually patent , HSG demonstrate patency little chance 5 % tube occlude ( 10 ) . There several factor lead false diagnosis tubal occlusion use HSG . The common factor cite cornual spasm ( 11 ) , could simply resistance difference two tube ( 12 ) factor exist mucous plug proximal part fallopian tube ( 13 ) . Diagnostic laparoscope perform HSG show decrease rate diagnosis initial tubal occlusion 40-60 % ( 14-16 ) . There study repeat HSG 1 month later patient HSG show proximal tubal blockage , show tubal patency 60 % ( 17 ) . And many study administration antispasmodic analgesic drug distinguish tubal spasm tubal occlusion HSG . Such Glucagon , Hyoscine butylbromide , ASA , Terbutaline , Diazepam , Fenoterol Mitamizole etc ( 18-21 ) . There one prospective study hyoscine butylbromide use tubal occlusion occur HSG , show appear safe effective drug relieve proximal tubal obstruction 80 % ( 22 ) . Hyoscine-N-butylbromide ( BuscopanÂ® ) , antispasmodic drug commonly use relief smooth muscle spasm use relieve genito-urinary spasm . Hyoscine exert spasmolytic action , peripheral anticholinergic effect result ganglion-blocking action within visceral wall well anti-muscarinic activity , could decrease pain uterine cramping . And relief tubal obstruction HSG procedure , previous study investigate compare efficacy randomize double-blind control trial . And inexpensive , safe minimal side effect , study report hyoscine relieve dysmenorrhea ( 23-24 ) . In Thailand , report one common cause female infertility tubal pathology account 27 % case ( 25 ) . And Infertile clinic Songklanagarind Hospital , mostly use HSG standard first-line evaluate tubal patency . We hypothesize Hyoscine-N-butylbromide use HSG relieve tubal occlusion true occlusion . It possible decrease false positive rate diagnosis tubal occlusion cause cornual spasm . So apply use decrease necessity laparoscopy chromopertubation definitive test tubal occlusion repeat . And also reduce medical cost expensive investigation medical complication .</detailed_description>
