	<brief_summary>Background : Poor flow ( PF ) catheter-related blood stream infection ( CRBSI ) highly prevalent among CKD 5D patient long-term central venous catheter . Heparin ( H ) catheter lock solution commonly use maintain catheter patency , however PF CRBSI incidence remain high . The purpose study evaluate two lock solution reduction PF CRBSI : one , lock solution combine tetracycline antibiotic minocycline anticoagulant/chelation agent EDTA ( M-EDTA ) versus H ; , trisodium citrate ( C ) versus H. M-EDTA C also evaluate safety versus H. Methods : As regard pilot project , thirty CKD 5D patient high-efficiency hemodialysis ( blood flow rate = 350 ml/min ) Integrated Centre Nephrology ( Guarulhos , Brazil ) randomize 1:1:1 receive M-EDTA , C H lock 15 week . Lock solution concentration M-EDTA 30 mg/ml/3 mg/ml , C 30 % ( C ) H 1,000 U/ml investigator patient blind treatment allocation . The primary end-point 10 % reduction HD blood flow rate ( 35ml ) . The frequency CRBSI record . Bleeding lock solution-related adverse event primary safety end point . Logistic Regression perform evaluate difference PF rate among treatment ( SPSS version 13.0 , IBM , USA ) . Based upon pilot-study data , clinical trial execute order verify whether three lock solution performance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : 75 CKD 5D patient high-efficiency hemodialysis ( blood flow rate = 350 ml/min ) Integrated Centre Nephrology ( Guarulhos , Brazil ) randomize 1:1:1 receive M-EDTA , C H lock 15 week . Lock solution concentration M-EDTA 30 mg/ml/3 mg/ml , C 30 % ( C ) H 1,000 U/ml investigator patient blind treatment allocation . The primary end-point 10 % reduction HD blood flow rate ( 35ml ) . The frequency CRBSI record . Poor Flow Rate ( event/1,000 catheter-day ) CRBSI Rate ( event/1,000 catheter-day ) calculate arm . Bleeding lock solution-related adverse event also primary safety end point rate ( events/1,000 catheter-day ) calculate . Logistic Regression perform evaluate difference PF , CRBSI , Bleeding lock solution-related adverse event rate among treatment ( SPSS version 13.0 , IBM , USA ) .</detailed_description>
