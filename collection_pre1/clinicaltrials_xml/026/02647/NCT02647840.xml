	<brief_summary>This study want investigate treatment patient common voice disorder surgical medical treatment need . A voice disorder voice croaky , hoarse lose altogether . This serious problem people stop participate normal life ( example job , hobby , family wider social life ) . This study look commonly use method treatment voice problem . This method base physical exercise work muscle produce voice . This voice work originally develop Jo Estill , singer scientist , widely use voice coach . Though many Speech Language Therapists ( SLTs ) provide voice therapy base Estill model , clinical evidence support use . The aim study test design large research study effect voice therapy base Estill model voice . We want find test work easy use , check study method right would work large scale . It feasibility study , therefore allow u test whether study do . Another important part study involve patient develop research . We want find patient think treatment receive , take part study . The way study work patient agree take part four six voice therapy appointment , like would part study . Voice test result treatment compare carefully study . After patient take part study finish treatment , ask experience voice therapy , study . Much do part study identical normally do treatment , however look detail test , need permission participant use test result include comment . It important learn voice therapy improve voice therapy patient type voice problem . By find patient think treatment provide , test use , best run research trial , able plan research hopefully successful next large research grant application .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Voice Therapy Based Estill Voice Model : Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims Objectives The overall aim study test feasibility study effect Estill base voice therapy patient functional dysphonia . The objective : To gather information help u design large study , specifically - many participant expect recruit - rate consent - rate attrition - many therapy session patient attend length time ( length episode care &amp; total therapy time minute ) To test outcome measure - use OperaVOX iPad clinical outcome measurement useful clinician participant ; quick , easy use , reliable ? - Standard Deviation ( SD ) outcome measure estimate sample size trial To describe therapy content detail replicate meaningfully practised participant - advice sheets/ therapy instruction give To investigate participant experience - What like functional dysphonia - What like voice therapy - What like take part study - Does overall design work smoothly participant - What work well/ could better participant Plan investigation General research design This feasibility study use mixed method research design . We gain quantitative data clinical voice assessment analyse use descriptive statistic . We also use qualitative research design use post-intervention focus group evaluate participant ' experience . The study design control bias control participant blind intervention . We therefore able make judgment whether Estill base voice therapy effective treat functional dysphonia study . Study population The target population adult patient refer SLT department Ear Nose Throat Consultant diagnosis 'functional dysphonia ' , 'hyperfunctional dysphonia ' 'muscle tension dysphonia ' presenting alter voice quality essentially normal larynx examination . Patients diagnosis ' ( early ) vocal nodule ' 'mild vocal oedema ' may also include underlie aetiology inappropriate muscular tension hyperfunction , voice therapy treatment choice . Patients age 16 , Exeter , Mid East Devon - area normally serve voice specialist service Royal Devon &amp; Exeter Foundation NHS Trust . We plan include 20 patient , sample size adequate making accurate estimation recruitment judgement outcome measure ( include SD ) . Patients voice problem indicate presence muscle tension diagnosis specify eligible take part . Patients hear problem , cognitive difficulty memory loss , significant co-morbidities uncontrolled reflux previous radiotherapy Head &amp; Neck Cancer exclude study , limit expect progress . For reason , patient significant psychogenic issue underlie voice problem exclude essentially diagnosis psychogenic dysphonia . All patient include study offer voice therapy appropriate need usual . Last year , 130 patient functional dysphonia attend voice therapy SLT department would eligible take part . It estimate feasible recruit 20 participant six month period . Potential participant identify basis referral letter ENT diagnosis presentation . When patient receive standard letter invite contact SLT department voice therapy appointment , potentially eligible patient receive information leaflet study . On initial attendance SLT department , give information consent form sign happy take part . It make clear participant free take part withdraw study time without affect treatment way .</detailed_description>
