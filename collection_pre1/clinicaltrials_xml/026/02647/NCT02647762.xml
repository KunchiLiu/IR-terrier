	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , active- placebo-controlled , parallel-group study subject clinically active RA MTX-na√Øve . Subjects meet enrollment criterion randomize 1 4 group 2:2:2:1 ratio : CF101 1 mg , CF101 2 mg , MTX , match placebo tablet . CF101 match placebo administer every 12 hour 24 week treatment . MTX match placebo administer week Screening examination occur within 6 week prior dose . The following conventional drug RA treatment must stable respective designate period prior Screening Visit must remain protocol participation : nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) , corticosteroid &gt; 1 month . All subject receive oral folate ( minimum dose 5 mg/week ) oral folinic acid ( 10 mg/week ) , base Investigator 's preference . Disease activity assess use swollen tender joint count , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , CRP . Efficacy assess Disease Activity Score 28 use erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( DAS28-ESR ) , ACR response criterion European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) response criterion : swell tender joint count , physician global assessment ( visual analog scale , patient global assessment , patient report pain , Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) Disability Index ( DI ) , Westergren ESR level , CRP level .
