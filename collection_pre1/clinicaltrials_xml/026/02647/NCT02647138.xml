	<brief_summary>Many patient complain clinician difficulty sleep appear due environmental noise . There common perception acute noise troublesome continuous noise effect individual sleep quality . Therefore goal use Marpac white noise maker continuous noise see effect individual difficulty sleep high noise environment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect White Noise In High Noise Environment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insomnia patient recruit base perception high noise apartment . The investigator screen patient first meeting use The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0 ( MINI 6.0 ) . At baseline , Insomnia Severity Index administer . The study consist one week baseline period noise level monitor use spectral analysis decibel level sleep duration record use subjective sleep log wrist actigraphy objective measurement . At end first week Insomnia Severity Index administer . During second week , treatment period white noise machine use fix decibel level instal bedrooms subject . The room noise continue monitor via spectral analysis well decibel level patient wear actigraphs keep sleep log . At end second week Insomnia Severity Index administer . During third week , white noise machine remove room still monitor sound via spectral analysis decibel level subject wear actigraph keep sleep log . At end third week Insomnia Severity Index administer . The total number subject 20 . The investigator use Analysis Covariance ( ANCOVA ) baseline vs. white noise analyze difference . The investigator use Acute Noise Index , noise spike 2 standard deviation mean entire night decibel level count noise event . Noise level subject bedroom collect throughout study along subject sleep activity use actigraph sleep log .</detailed_description>
