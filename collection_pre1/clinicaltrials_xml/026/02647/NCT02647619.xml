	<brief_summary>Aim : Clinical RCT compare functional result recurrence rate follow enzymatic treatment vs. needle aponeurotomy . Materials method : 30° contracture one metacarpophalangeal ( MCP ) joint contracture one three ulnar digit le 20° adjacent proximal interphalangeal ( PIP ) joint . Patients primary disease hand . Total 80 patient need detect difference 13.5° . 1 ) Needle aponeurotomy 2 ) Clostridium Histolyticum treatment . Clinical follow ups 1,4 week , 16 week 1,2 5 year . Functional outcome score : URAM , Quick Dash , EQ5D , brief MHQ , VAS pain VAS patient satisfaction . Total passive extension contracture reduction , recurrence rate registration complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Open surgery ( fascieectomy ) traditionally consider gold standard treatment Dupytren´s disease ( Dd ) despite considerable risk complication . There increase interest Scandinavia treatment Dd Clostridium Histolyticum ( Xiapex ® , Auxillium ) . However enzyme expensive long-term effect well document . More study need analyze short long term clinical outcome well cost-benefit analysis . The treatment arm Xiapex study follow recommendation producer . The treatment Dd contracture study needle fasiotomy/aponeurotomy . We use multiple perforation technigue 26 G needle needle , little local anesthesia ( xylocin w adrenaline ) need contionus extension finger untill successfully extend . The two procedure leave little scar tissue lessen challenge pose reoperations . Recurrence rate contracture follow different treatment Dupuytren 's disease differs widely literature , rate influence multiple factor .</detailed_description>
