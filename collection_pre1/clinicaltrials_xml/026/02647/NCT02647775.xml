	<detailed_description>Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) first report early 1990s . Since , safety efficacy thoracoscopy diagnose treat pleural , pulmonary , mediastinal disease demonstrate similar oncological result , confirm multiple clinical study . Although VATS thoracic surgery practical , show reduce postoperative discomfort , improve cosmetic result compare open thoracotomy , unfortunately chronic thoracic wound discomfort postoperative neuralgia find significant portion patient . Recently , minimally invasive approach different conventional multiport thoracoscopic technique gradually become great interest diagnosis treatment thoracic surgical disease . Single-port VATS one promise emerge surgical technique allow surgeon perform majority thoracic surgery similar perioperative outcome comparable conventional multiport technique . However , limited number clinical study demonstrate advantage single port VATS postoperative pain reduction , compare traditional multiport thoracoscopic approach . To clarify physiologic immunologic effect different approach minimally invasive thoracic surgery , investigator aim compare perioperative physiological change , immunological response , postoperative pain standard ( multi-port ) transthoracic thoracoscopic single-port transthoracic thoracoscopic surgery thoracic disease .</detailed_description>
