Subjects body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 18 kg/m2 30 kg/m2 , inclusive , weigh ≥ 50 kg 100 kg , inclusive . BMI calculate weight [ kg ] / ( height [ ] ) 2 . Subjects must good health determine medical history , physical examination Screening investigation , take regular medication . Willing comply study restriction , include use contraception , concomitant medication dietary lifestyle restriction . Possessing sufficient intelligence understand nature study hazard participate , ability communicate satisfactorily Investigator participate , comply requirement , entire study . Has give write consent participate reading inform consent form ( ICF ) , opportunity discus study Investigator delegate . Have give write consent data enter The Overvolunteering Prevention System . Clinically relevant abnormal history , physical finding , ECG find laboratory value could interfere objective study safety subject . Presence history acute chronic illness , include ( limited ) liver ( Gilbert 's Syndrome permit ) kidney disease , hypertension , seizure , know impairment endocrine , specific body organ dysfunction . Presence history severe adverse reaction medicine . Presence history malignant disease . Significant illness within 4 week dose study medication . Dosed another clinical trial new chemical entity prescription medicine within previous 3 month , unwilling abstain participate clinical trial study 3 month receipt study medication . Participation another clinical study DS1040b . Blood pressure ( BP ) heart rate ( HR ) semi supine position Screening examination outside range 90 mmHg 140 mmHg systolic , 40 mmHg 90 mmHg diastolic ; HR 40 beats/min 100 beats/min . A subject vital sign value outside reference range population study may include Investigator 's discretion unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Abnormal ECG waveform morphology Screening would preclude accurate measurement uncorrected QT interval ( QT ) duration . QT interval HR correct use Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) interval duration &gt; 430 msec obtain average measurement triplicate Screening ECGs . Use prescription medicine , counter ( OTC ) medication , herbal remedy ( St John 's Wort ) , food know strong inhibitor strong inducer cytochrome ( CYP ) enzymes 30 day dose study medication ; use prescription OTC medicine ( except permit ) , include dietary supplement herbal remedy , 7 day receive study medication . Consumption certain food beverage dose throughout study period Loss 400 mL blood ( plasma ) , donation platelet blood component 3 month dose study medication , unwilling abstain study 3 month receipt study medication . Abuse drug alcohol past , intake 21 unit alcohol weekly . Moderate heavy use tobacco product nicotine contain product ( eg ≥ 5 cigarette per day 3 month dose study medication . Male subject agree use contraception ( condom spermicide ) addition female partner ( childbearing potential ) use another form contraception ( eg , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , oral contraceptive , injectables , subdermal hormonal implant ) receive study medication 4 month follow dose administration . Also , male subject must donate sperm least 4 month follow last dose administration . Evidence acute chronic infectious disease Screening , include : positive Hepatitis B Surface Antigen ( HBsAg ) , Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) antibody , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody . Subjects use anticoagulant ( ie , warfarin , low molecular weight heparin , thrombin inhibitor ) , antiplatelet medication ( eg , clopidogrel ) , and/or aspirin within 30 day prior Day 1 . Subjects history major bleed major surgical procedure type within 6 month Day 1 . Subjects history peptic ulcer , gastrointestinal bleeding include haematemesis , melena , bleed haemorrhoid . Subjects history minor bleeding episode epistaxis , rectal bleeding ( spots blood toilet paper ) , gingival bleeding within 3 month Day 1 . Subjects family history , suspect document , coagulopathy haemoglobinopathy evidence abnormal coagulation parameter ( eg , Prothrombin Time PT , International Normalised Ratio INR Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time aPTT ) Screening . Subjects borderline value PT , INR aPTT enrol abnormality consider clinically significant investigator . Subjects estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) Screening use MDRD ( Modification Diet Renal Disease ) equation &lt; 90 mL/min . Likely possibility subject cooperate requirement protocol . Objection General Practitioner subject enter study .</criteria>
