	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common malignancy among men United States Canada . Suspicion prostate cancer modern screening test , digital rectal exam ( DRE ) prostate serum antigen ( PSA ) require ultrasound-guided biopsy pathological diagnosis . However , technique miss cancer nearly one quarter patient find clinically insignificant disease another third patient , result over-treatment unnecessary morbidity . MRI best image method prostate cancer detection , current technique reliably predict tumour grade often unreliable localize cancer , particularly within transition zone , specificity low . The primary objective pilot study evaluate add benefit localize prostate cancer predict tumour grade Hyperpolarized 13C MRI , addition traditional T2-weighted diffusion-weighted MR imaging . The investigator propose pilot study , men diagnose prostate cancer await prostatectomy , specific goal compare pre-operative imaging finding ground truth histology , use whole-mount prostate specimen . The result study provide insight prostate cancer disease signatures MRI determine add benefit incorporation new technique future clinical MRI protocol . If future imaging test could determine size , grade extent disease , would open door less invasive , localized treatment option reduce morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiparametric MRI Prostate Cancer Localization Characterization Using Hyperpolarized Pyruvate ( 13C ) Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolism 13C ( non-radioactive ) enrich pyruvate image magnetic resonance ( MR ) spectroscopy nuclear spin 13C hyperpolarization enhance . This technique allow in-vivo separation [ 1-13C ] pyruvate , [ 1-13C ] lactate , [ 1-13C ] alanine [ 13C ] bicarbonate signal follow intravenous administration Hyperpolarized Pyruvate ( 13C ) Injection . The total 13C-signal detect give tissue depend dose administered distribution tissue . The formation rate relative level metabolite depend metabolic need specific tissue . Pre-clinical data indicate tumour show substantially high level different ratio specific metabolite compare correspond normal tissue . Soon take cell within prostate , [ 1-13C ] pyruvate metabolize various metabolite , include [ 1-13C ] alanine [ 13C ] bicarbonate ( via aerobic metabolism ) [ 1-13C ] lactate ( via anaerobic metabolism ) . It expect [ 1-13C ] lactate form much high amount malignant tissue , level glycolysis high normal , BPH inflame tissue . Therefore , spectroscopic MR image prostate administration Hyperpolarized Pyruvate ( 13C ) Injection , expect provide robust , minimally invasive method assist detect characterize prostate cancer , thereby determine patient receive treatment continue monitor via routine PSA DRE test . This pilot prospective , single-institution study men biopsy-proven carcinoma prostate . Patient screen accrual complete treat Urologist , Radiologist , study nurse/coordinator . Clinical procedure complete Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre ( SHSC ) . Eligible subject undergo radical prostatectomy SHSC biopsy-proven T1C disease ( cancer find elevate PSA needle biopsy ) serum PSA &lt; 10 . For purpose analysis , subject divide three group base grade cancer find needle biopsy . A typical subject 50-80 year old . The length study participant approximately 1 hour scan time .</detailed_description>
