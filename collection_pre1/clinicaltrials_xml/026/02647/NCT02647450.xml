	<brief_summary>An estimated 90,000 patient suffer long term gastrointestinal problem cancer treatment , whilst National Cancer Survivorship Initiative work develop specific pathway care , pathways lack specialise tariff funding awareness . This study aim assess economic personal impact patient suffer stomach and/or bowel problem cancer treatment prior referral Gastrointestinal Nutrition Team ( GIANT ) Royal Marsden Hospital . All patient refer GIANT service ( include private patient exclude referral ) offer participation study . The study consist 9 page patient retrospective questionnaire , ask question investigation medication prescribe past year , well cost method try treat symptom , personal cost symptom loss work emotional impact . As questionnaire ask patient question past year , thus difficult answer accurately , patient answer validate reliability send 1 page questionnaire GP ask question clinic visit concern stomach/bowel problem , investigation medication prescribe past year . Once data collect participant , study finish , average cost clinical intervention , economic impact , personal impact , calculate . The result study useful help show economic burden GI symptom , provide evidence economic benefit specialise clinic consequence cancer treatment; highlight need nationally recognise algorithm management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The number people survive cancer triple past 30 years; however , chronic physical consequence treatment cancer adversely affect quality life 20-25 % survivor . The large group patient report debilitate chronic side effect treat radiotherapy alone combination treatment pelvic cancer . Gastrointestinal symptoms common chronic physical side effect report , great effect daily activity . Overall , 50 % patient report gastrointestinal symptom affect quality life , 20-40 % state effect moderate severe . Such problem include chronic faecal incontinence ( 60 % patient ) radiotherapy prostate rectal cancer ( 53 , 54 ) , chronic loose stool ( 47 % ) , defaecatory urgency ( 29 % ) , chronic abdominal pain ( 17 % ) radiotherapy gynecological cancer . In 2010 , UK National Cancer Survivorship Initiative Vision challenge professional develop new model care patient `` needs cancer survivor meet , 'cured ' cancer necessarily equate well chronic consequence treatment devastate impact daily life '' . The National Cancer Survivorship Initiative accept currently limited access specialist service , despite estimate 90,000 people UK experience long-term gastrointestinal problem consequence cancer treatment . Furthermore , recent survey clinical oncologist gastroenterologist concur sentiment , highlight lack available expertise; two UK audit gastroenterology consultant oncologists demonstrate improvement provision specialist service 2003 2010 . Whilst NHS Improvement develop stratify pathway care , Roadmap Recovery report create recently Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Transplant charity underline ongoing issue lack specialise commissioning service complex consequence cancer treatment . It estimate £40 million ( DoH ) waste annually futile dangerous treatment Pelvic Radiation Disease alone; academic estimate suggest close £80 million . Furthermore incapacitating affect GI symptom lead loss productivity huge social cost . Currently NHS tariff payable GI consequence cancer treatment; however mean cost per complete episode care GIANT ( Gastrointestinal Nutrition Team ) service calculate , amount average cost £1563 per patient . This compare tariff £14,800 per woman treat chemo-radiation cervical cancer , cost excess £45,000 person rectal cancer treat long course chemo-radiation follow surgery adjuvant chemotherapy . With specialist clinic lack , assumed majority people live GI consequence cancer treatment treat GPs; however , Quality Outcomes Framework GP Surgeries measure award financial incentive include domain measure gastrointestinal problems; study cost manage patient GI problem consequence cancer treatment outside GIANT service . This exploratory study step direction .</detailed_description>
