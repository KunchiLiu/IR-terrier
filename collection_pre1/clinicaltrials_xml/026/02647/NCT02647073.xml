	<detailed_description>1 . PURPOSE The purpose pilot study assess feasibility novel device ( Canary 01 Mobile Vital Signs Monitoring Device ) individual inject opioids hospital inpatient high-dose oral opioid medication . The primary objective evaluate device reliably comfortably wear extended duration time follow opioid consumption accurately monitor change vital sign ( electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , heart rate , respiratory rate ) clinical population set . A secondary purpose study enrich understanding change vital sign occur post-opioid-consumption . The long-term goal study create device allow clinician patient detect adverse effect opioid consumption early ( i.e . respiratory depression ) , appropriate treatment intervention deliver prevent overdose-related morbidity mortality . 2 . HYPOTHESES The team hypothesize Canary 01 Mobile Vital Signs Monitoring Device prove feasible reliable device monitoring vital sign consumption opioids , among individual inject opioids among individual high dos opioid medication . 3 . JUSTIFICATION Opioid medication key agent treat acute pain , cancer pain , deem essential medicine pain care World Health Organization . However , opioid medication serious side effect profile include contribute delirium , oversedation respiratory depression event overdose . Between 2005 2009 , 815 death relate fentanyl , hydromorphone , morphine oxycodone British Columbia . Opioid overdose second lead cause accidental death United States . In addition adverse event , opioids know highly addictive . In Canada , estimate 75,000-125,000 injection drug user ( vast majority injected opioids ) well approximately 200,000 people prescription opioid dependence , 2012 . Knowledge gain innovative pilot study inform development mobile monitor device design alert clinician cardiopulmonary change indicate opioid overdose patient , allow rapid detection , intervention administration potentially life-saving treatment . Ultimately , clinical implementation device could lead reduction substantial morbidity mortality attributable opioid-related overdoses . In addition , fulfillment secondary objective , feasibility study contribute new knowledge regard change cardiopulmonary status associate use high opioid dos . 4 . OBJECTIVES Primary Objective To determine whether mobile monitoring system specific vital sign ( e.g. , heart rate respiratory rate ) use successfully monitor opioid dependent individual . Specifically , study team examine : 1 . Participant compliance ; 2 . Feasibility specific vital sign data collection , storage , analysis participant status assessment ; 3 . Clinical utility overall participant provider acceptability mobile monitor device Secondary Objective To document characterize change cardiopulmonary status associate opioid consumption . 5 ) RESEARCH METHOD The MOVE study single site , three-week feasibility study individual report ongoing/current injection opioid use . Potential study participant recruit Providence Crosstown Clinic St. Paul 's Hospital . The target enrolment goal 25 . At study recruitment site , potential study candidate invite participate , provide informed consent complete Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) order assess eligibility . Once find eligible , individual recruit Crosstown Clinic complete study visit ( Visits 2 , 3 &amp; 4 ) Crosstown Clinic . At Crosstown Clinic , individual receive manage treatment opioid dependence know quantity drug ( e.g . diacetylmorphine , hydromorphone ) . The clinic staffed clinician train equipped deal potential opioid overdoses . For hospital inpatient recruit St. Paul 's Hospital , study visit occur hospital . All participant monitor three separate study visit . At start session prior opioid consumption , study coordinator assist placement two mobile monitor device study participant measure specific vital sign : - Heart rate ECG monitor : Heart rate ECG data collect compact , wireless device 3 lead place participant 's chest . The lead connect processor/battery pack unit , approximately size bar soap . - Respiratory rate collect use Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography ( RIP ) belt , fasten around participant 's abdomen . - Activity monitoring : An Inertial Measurement Unit ( IMU ) ( gyro ) incorporate within device measure participant 's activity . At Crosstown Clinic , participant receive manage treatment via self-injection monitor total duration 120 minute clinic room/post-treatment room . At St. Paul 's Hospital , participant administer dose oral opioid medication monitor duration 120 minute ideally bedside hospital room always within hospital ward . Monitoring device wear total duration 120 minute . The study coordinator remain participant throughout observation period . In addition vital sign data , study coordinator complete activity log document activity occur time monitor place . In addition , medical treatment and/or intervention administer time record member study team . Data mobile monitor transmit via Bluetooth smart phone , securely transmit study database . Transmitted data cod participant 's study identification code contain protect health information utilized clinical decision-making . It important highlight data collect mobile monitoring device solely use research serve clinical decision-making purpose . All participant discharge study Visit 4 . Participants offer addiction treatment referral request . Safety data collect 30 day follow last study visit follow-up serious adverse event continue resolution . THE MOBILE VITAL SIGNS MONITORING DEVICE The prototype several main component , include several commercially available sensor measure heart rate , respiration , motion data , enclose case contain circuitry process transmit data , mobile phone/system interface store transmit data . Data collect respiratory band , ECG electrodes , accelerometer . The safety individual sensor component evaluate previously respective manufacturer currently available commercial purpose . Two respiratory band , worn thorax abdomen , measure pattern change participant breathe pattern . Although yet implement , output breath per minute could extract data file use peak finding frequency analysis software future . Four ECG electrode place participant 's thorax abdomen record analog voltage change correspond electrical potential difference occur cardiac cycle ( i.e . heartbeat ) . The electrode configure 3-lead setup , three signal electrode driven electrode . In unlikely event device malfunction , Analog Devices ECG chip current-limiting protection circuit use optimize participant safety , per manufacturer specification . The 3-axis analog accelerometer sample 10 Hz , use denote activity motion artefact may influence ECG respiratory data . These sensor attach custom print circuit board ( PCB ) Bluetooth module inside 3D printed case . The PCB hold two microprocessor need system : PIC16LF1618 Broadcom Wireless Internet Connectivity Embedded Devices ( WICED ) Smart . The WICED Smart communicate sensor data mobile phone use Bluetooth Low Energy ( BLE ) . The case hold circuit board 3.7 V lithium-ion battery ; circuit board screw separate compartment inaccessible patient . The circuit board process send data phone application . Data transfer wirelessly Standardized Query Language ( SQL ) database . Within database , data point associate timestamp patient Identification ( ID ) , allow multiple patient ' data store SQL database . Finally , battery include case test last two day continuous use . 6 ) STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive statistic , include mean , standard deviation , median 95 % confidence interval mean continuous variable , frequency distribution categorical variable produce participant demographic baseline characteristic . STATISTICAL METHODS FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES As feasibility study , complex statistical analysis plan . EXPLORATORY ANALYSES Biometric data collect opioid consumption compile used construct preliminary simulation model average change heart rate respiratory rate follow consumption high dose opioids . Ultimately , goal modeling exercise develop clinical algorithm use mobile sign monitor device determine threshold risk level therapeutic intervention require threshold .</detailed_description>
