	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Treatment Actinic Keratoses With Photodynamic Therapy Between MAL Cream ALA Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraindividual comparative study , evaluate efficacy safety treatment actinic keratosis photodynamic therapy methyl aminolevulinate cream ( MAL ) aminolevulinic acid nanosoma gel ( ALA ) . MAL cream : antineoplastic agent use photosensitizer photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . The mode action methyl aminolevulinate PDT show pharmacodynamic ( PD ) study . In target cell , methyl aminolevulinate convert photoactive porphyrin , include protoporphyrinIX ( PpIX ) , active photosensitizers . Upon light activation , photosensitizers give rise production cytotoxic singlet oxygen specie destroy target cell . ALA gel : Following topical application 5-aminolaevulinic acid , substance metabolize protoporphyrin IX , photoactive compound accumulate intracellularly treat actinic keratosis lesion . Protoporphyrin IX activate illumination red light suitable wavelength energy . In presence oxygen , reactive oxygen specie form . The latter cause damage cellular component eventually destroy target cell . Photodynamic therapy technique ( PDT ) conventional technique perform apply product occlusion lesion , let incubate 3 hour expose skin light source , usually red . The conclusion efficacy , tolerance satisfaction today know PDT MAL , ALA , new photosensitizer indicate QA . The pharmaceutical form ALA gel , give hypothetical good penetration consequently effectively .</detailed_description>
