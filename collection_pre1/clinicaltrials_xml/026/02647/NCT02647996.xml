	<brief_title>Functional Connectivity Measurement After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recovery consciousness impair severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Prognostic factor sparse mostly clinical ( mainly initial Glasgow coma scale GCS ) ( 1 ) . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) could allow good understand functional recovery . Graph method apply fMRI signal analysis disorder consciousness ( DOC ) due post-anoxic encephalopathy . Comatose state characterize dramatic change local connectivity ( hub location ) without significant change global connectivity ( 2 ) . The present study aim describe functional connectivity DOC follow severe TBI . We record rest state fMRI TBI patient two clinical condition : conscious state versus DOC state .</detailed_description>
