	<brief_summary>Despite develop robust acquire immunity complication malaria , woman return susceptible state first pregnancy contribute significantly burden severe malaria highly endemic area . Naturally acquire protection placental malaria correlate presence high concentration immunoglobulin G molecule ( IgGs ) VAR2CSA , parasite protein var gene family essential binding infect erythrocytes CSA placenta . To induce high concentration specific IgGs , subject receive escalate dos PAMVAC vaccine antigen adjuvanted Alhydrogel , Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant-Stable Emulsion ( GLA-SE ) Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant-Liposome-QS-21 Formulation ( GLA-LSQ ) . Three injection dosage adjuvant do , 28 day apart ( Day 0 , 28 56 ) . Control subject receive physiological saline instead vaccine dose escalation stagger ensure safety trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase 1 , stagger , two-center , dose-escalation trial . The trial conduct two stage . The first Germany ( first man dose escalation ) second malaria-endemic area target group ( randomize , control , dose-finding ) . First man administration dose escalation 20 50 μg per injection PAMVAC adjuvanted Alhydrogel , GLA-SE GLA-LSQ do healthy , malaria-naïve adult Germany ( Stage 1 ) . Subsequently , PAMVAC administer healthy , lifelong malaria-exposed nulligravid woman Benin dose 50 100 μg , adjuvanted Alhydrogel GLA-SE ( Stage 2 ) . The PAMVAC vaccine VAR2CSA protein-based vaccine , aim protect fetus mother adverse effect placental malaria pregnancy . As interaction parasite protein VAR2CSA CSA human placenta key element pathogenesis placental malaria , vaccine elicit type immunoglobulins block bind VAR2CSA CSA . A small sub-unit VAR2CSA protein ( ID1-ID2a ) select PAMVAC vaccine antigen . In animal model IgGs induce immunization recombinant PAMVAC antigen able inhibit homologous parasite-infected erythrocyte adhesion CSA vitro . The three adjuvant Alhydrogel , aluminum hydroxide gel widely use adjuvant trial ; GLA-SE GLA-LSQ , synthetic TLR-4 agonist strong immune stimulatory effect formulate either stable oil-in-water emulsion ( SE ) together QS-21 ( Saponin derive Quillaja saponaria tree ) liposome ( LSQ ) . In Benin , one group receive placebo control ( physiological saline ) . Allocation placebo , PAMVAC+Alhydrogel PAMVAC+GLA-SE , randomize trial team well participant keep blind ( double-blinded ) allocation . All participant ( Stage 1+2 ) receive three intramuscular injection four-week interval . Each dose-escalation conditional positive safety assessment independent Safety Monitoring Board ( SMB ) sponsor approval . One individual PAMVAC-adjuvant combination serve sentinel . The sentinel inject one day rest group . There minimum 4 week stagger first immunization Groups 1A-3A Groups 4A-6A . Group 1A ( n = 3 ) - 20 µg PAMVAC+Alhydrogel Group 2A ( n = 3 ) - 20 µg PAMVAC+GLA-SE Group 3A ( n = 3 ) - 20 µg PAMVAC+GLA-LSQ Group 4A ( n = 9 ) - 50 µg PAMVAC+Alhydrogel Group 5A ( n = 9 ) - 50 µg PAMVAC+GLA-SE Group 6A ( n = 9 ) - 50 µg PAMVAC+GLA-LSQ Following safety assessment SMB first dose Groups 4A-6A approval sponsor , Stage 2 ( Benin ) initiate . Here , target population PAMVAC ( healthy nulligravid woman malaria-endemic area ) vaccinate . Upon SMB review approval sponsor Groups 1B-2B half subject control Group 5B receive vaccination . One participant allocate group 1B , 2B 5B receive first immunization least one day rest group . Group 1B ( n=9 ) - 50 µg PAMVAC+Alhydrogel Group 2B ( n=9 ) - 50 µg PAMVAC+GLA-SE Group 3B ( n=3 ) - 100 µg PAMVAC+Alhydrogel Group 4B ( n=3 ) - 100 µg PAMVAC+GLA-SE Group 5B ( n=6 ) - Placebo ( physiological saline solution ) There 4 week stagger Groups 1B-2B Group 3B-4B remain subject control Group 5B allow safety evaluation SMB . Here , system sentinel vaccination lower dose use ; one participant allocate group 3B , 4B 5B receive first immunization least one day rest group .</detailed_description>
