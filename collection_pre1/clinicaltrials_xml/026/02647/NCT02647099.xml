	<brief_title>Adjuvant Low Dose Aspirin Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALASCCA randomize , parallel group , double blind , multicenter , placebo-controlled , biomarker-based study adjuvant treatment low dose aspirin colorectal cancer . Patients ( adult male female ) colorectal cancer clinical stage I-III localize disease consider study . Patients screen inclusion time surgery tumor ( time routine patient visit elective surgery postoperatively within 12 week case emergency procedure screen miss preoperatively ) . After inclusion surgery perform , patient PIK3 mutation stage II III tumor randomize receive 160 mg aspirin placebo orally . Last date randomization start treatment 12 week postoperatively . The treatment administer alone combination adjuvant chemotherapy . The choice adjuvant chemotherapy make Investigator follow guideline National Care Program . The treatment administer 3 year . There follow-up period two year . Outside trial , patient treat accord standard care site . A phone contact make 3 month randomization visit thereafter every 6th month . The patient also visit site 6 month randomization thereafter every 6th month i.e . patient contact site every 3rd month . There also visit/phone contact end follow-up period . A total 3900 patient screen order include 408 patient PIK3CA ( Exon 9 20 ) mutate tumor treatment arm ( Group A ) . With estimate 20 % drop-out rate , 204 patient randomized arm . This also include approximately 15 % patient exclude due tumor stage 1 . An additional 408 patient mutation PI3K pathway gene PIK3CA ( exon 9 20 ) , PIK3R1 PTEN also randomize arm treat separate group analysis ( Group B ) . With estimate 20 % drop-out rate , 204 patient randomized arm . The randomization process expect take 24 month . Patients already treat ASA inclusion include observation group . An interim analysis make safety i.e incidence type serious bleed complication grade &gt; 1 12 month . An independent safety data monitoring committee responsible evaluate follow-up safety .</detailed_description>
