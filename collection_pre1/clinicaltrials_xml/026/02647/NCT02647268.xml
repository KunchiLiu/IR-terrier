	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) loss 500ml blood within 24 hour delivery . It major cause maternal morbidity mortality across globe . Oxytocin naturally-occurring hormone cause uterus contract , thereby cause labor . A synthetic form oxytocin use obstetric medicine way . It cause uterus contract act oxytocin receptor ( OTR ) . It use prevention treatment PPH . By cause uterus contract , constrict blood vessel within , thus reduce bleed . Oxytocin also use augment labor woman slow labor progression . Desensitization OTR prolong exposure oxytocin occur , lead reduce contraction uterus dos oxytocin . This demonstrate previous study do investigator . The resultant need high oxytocin dose cause adequate uterine contraction also demonstrate labor woman receive oxytocin labor augmentation . Magnesium sulphate ( MgSO4 ) widely use within obstetric medicine . It use seizure prevention treatment preeclampsia eclampsia , use fetal neuroprotection preterm labor , reduce risk cerebral palsy . It well-known relaxant effect uterine muscle , , use tocolytic agent preterm labour prevent premature contraction premature delivery . The effect MgSO4 contraction oxytocin pre-treated myometrium fully elucidate human lab study . There suggestion may lead increase oxytocin requirement increase postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) preeclamptic patient . This bear significance preeclamptic eclamptic population likely receive MgSO4 combination oxytocin . The investigator hypothesize MgSO4 reduce uterine contraction oxytocin pre-treated myometrium , well untreated myometrium , high oxytocin dos need produce equivalent contraction . This help u good understand implication use drug together clinical setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Magnesium Sulphate Pre-exposure Oxytocin-induced Contractility Desensitized Human Myometrium - Vitro Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MgSO4 know cause relaxation uterine muscle dos use preeclampsia eclampsia fetal neuroprotection . In clinical setting , delivery , oxytocin often give prevent treat PPH . There evidence patient preeclampsia already high risk PPH non-preeclamptic patient . In presence effect MgSO4 treatment uterus , PPH could worse theory . If patient oxytocin-augmented labor , desensitization effect uterus also come play . Performing study vitro allow u assess effect uterine muscle MgSO4 oxytocin-desensitized tissue sample . Scientific evidence pregnancy outcomes patient timely important . A study myometrial contractility control condition likely provide u information interaction oxytocin MgSO4 occur many clinical scenario , eliminate confounders could encounter clinical setting . The investigator hope determine myometrial contraction pattern induce oxytocin presence MgSO4 , include myometrial specimen pre-treated oxytocin plus MgSO4 , mimic clinical scenario preeclampsia fetal neuroprotection . This expand depth understanding desensitization phenomenon , could provide valuable insight mechanism responsible PPH patient population . This study form basis future modification oxytocin augmentation regimen pharmacotherapy control uterine atony PPH patient population simultaneously treat MgSO4 .</detailed_description>
