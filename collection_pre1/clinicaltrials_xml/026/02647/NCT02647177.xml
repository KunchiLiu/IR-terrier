	<brief_summary>The purpose To determine diagnostic potential various biological marker blood cyst fluid aspirate patient Pancreatic Cystic Lesions ( PCLs ) . Research design This 10-year prospective cohort pancreatic cyst fluid repository study enrol patient diagnose pancreatic cyst undergo cyst aspiration . Procedures use Blood Sample Cyst Fluid Sample Data Collection : Medical Record Number Demographics ( age , sex , gender , race ) Contact information History alcohol use IV recreational drug narcotic use/abuse Medication history Past hospitalization , diagnosis , treatment Physical examination finding Imaging data abdominal chest region , include limited ultrasonography , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , compute tomography ( CT ) Future admission , diagnosis , treatment include histopathological finding resect specimen blood report End study data : clinical progression disease , cyst size , wall thickening , calcification , communication pancreatic duct , string sign , cytology , immunohistochemical finding , assay level lipase , amylase CEA ( carcinoembryonic antigen ) , carbohydrate antigen19-9 ( CA 19-9 ) , biomarkers . Risks potential benefit The risk associate study slight discomfort bruise blood sample possible loss confidentiality patient data information inadvertently disclose outside study . The patient receive additional benefit study aside receive part routine standard care . Importance knowledge may reasonably expect result The knowledge gain study may benefit patient Pancreatic Cyst Lesions future .</brief_summary>
