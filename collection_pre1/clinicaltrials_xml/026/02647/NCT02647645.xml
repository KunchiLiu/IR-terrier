	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop pilot data potential efficacy computer-based cognitive training combination computer-based cognitive training transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) improve cognitive function person HIV-related mild neurocognitive disorder ( MND ) . tDCS noninvasive brain stimulation technique small direct current ( 1-2 mA ) apply scalp cognitive motor activity , induce small current affect specific neural circuit relate site electrode place . tDCS judged safe show significant treatment effect study population , extensively studied individual HIV infection . tDCS show facilitate learning number study , suggest may improve enhance learn cognitive problem . As HIV infection associate decrement number cognitive skill , include work memory , executive function , psychomotor speed related individual ' functional status medication adherence , demonstration technique enhance effect cognitive training population would substantial clinical benefit well scientific value .</brief_summary>
