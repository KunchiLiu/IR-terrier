	<brief_summary>The serratus anterior muscle plane ( SAM ) block associate pectoral nerve block type I ( PEC I ) may safe effective alternative intraoperative breast surgery , since evidence pain reduction . However , correlation regional anesthesia , postoperative pain inflammatory response breast surgery demonstrate . The aim study compare standard intravenous analgesia versus systemic analgesia associate SAM block PEC I breath cancer surgery . The following parameter evaluate : consumption opioid intra post-operative ; post-operative pain release plasma inflammatory cytokine . It clinical prospective , randomize control study . 50 individual randomly divide two group . A group patient receive general anesthesia surgery intravenous analgesia surgery another group receive general anesthesia associate SAM PEC I block intraoperative postoperative systemic analgesia . The postoperative pain assess use Visual Analogue Scale pain recovery room 24 hour surgery . Blood sample collect determination serum cytokine surgery 24 hour surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In breast surgery , regional anesthesia associate general anesthesia surgery show great result post-operative pain management , prevention tumor recurrence development neuropathic pain . It show regional anesthesia attenuate inflammatory response systemic change postoperatively breast surgery . Thus , important include additional analgesic intervention breast surgery order decrease local inflammatory response postoperative pain . Thus , serratus anterior muscle plane ( SAM ) block associate pectoral nerve block type I ( PEC I ) may safe effective alternative intraoperative breast surgery , since evidence pain reduction . However , correlation regional anesthesia , postoperative pain inflammatory response breast surgery demonstrate . The aim study compare standard intravenous analgesia versus systemic analgesia associate SAM block PEC I breath cancer surgery . The following parameter evaluate : consumption opioid intra post-operative ; post-operative pain release plasma inflammatory cytokine . It clinical prospective , randomize control study . 50 individual randomly divide two group . A group patient receive general anesthesia surgery intravenous analgesia surgery another group receive general anesthesia associate SAM PEC I block intraoperative postoperative systemic analgesia . The postoperative pain assess use Visual Analogue Scale pain recovery room 24 hour surgery . Blood sample collect determination serum cytokine surgery 24 hour surgery .</detailed_description>
