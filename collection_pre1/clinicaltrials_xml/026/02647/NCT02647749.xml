	<brief_summary>This current care protocol follow biomedical research protocol entitle `` Non-invasive mapping heart ECG high amplification '' demonstrate clinical value noninvasive CardioinsightÂ® mapping system . Guide management patient hospitalize cardiac rhythm radiofrequency ablation cardiac arrhythmia , implantation programming pacemaker , ass risk serious arrhythmia sudden death , currently use non-invasive mapping routine . The result obtain non-invasive mapping compare obtained conventional method without non-invasive mapping .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This current care protocol 3 group patient : 1 . Role mapping arrhythmias radiofrequency ablation : Radiofrequency ablation treatment atrial ventricular arrhythmia resistant drug treatment . The electrocardiogram allow full diagnosis arrhythmia appear difficult get comprehensive simultaneous view cardiac activity invasive map . The Investigators demonstrate feasibility map atrial fibrillation usefulness guide radiofrequency ablation . The non-invasive mapping would allow good understanding complex cardiac arrhythmia mechanism ( atrial fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation particular ) , would identify arrhythmogenic site thus facilitate radiofrequency ablation . 2 . Optimizing site implantation cardiac pacing lead program pacemaker : The optimal position cardiac pace lead may vary one patient another current choice implantation sit essentially guide imaging use power requirement inadequacy ECG standard . The Investigators already demonstrated usefulness non-invasive mapping selection potential responder cardiac resynchronization therapy . The non-invasive mapping would study cardiac electrical activation order determine optimal pace site optimum program accord patient thus improve clinical response pacing . 3 . Role diagnostic prognostic patient refer evaluation risk occurrence serious rhythm disorder sudden death : The possibility identify electrically abnormal area either activation , cardiac repolarization high-resolution ECG indication myocardial pathology unapparent standard ECG inaccessible image technique ( ultrasound , CT MRI ) . It likely electrical anomaly early diagnostic feature heart disease later apparent . Such anomaly also adverse prognostic weight ( risk arrhythmias sudden death ) correct highlight . Non-invasive mapping seem particularly important patient unexplained symptoms conventional test ( palpitation discomfort - syncope ) . It also applicable patient heart disease ( myocardial infarction , cardiomyopathy ) search localized electrical disorder originate site arrhythmia .</detailed_description>
