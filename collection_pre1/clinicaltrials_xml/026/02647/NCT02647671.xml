	<brief_summary>In propose study , investigator conduct 90-day dietary intervention study human subject . Thirty individual risk adenomatous colon polyp formation randomize receive calcium multi-mineral-rich natural product ( Aquamin ) comparable level calcium alone . There also placebo group . Prior ingest study agent follow course treatment , colonic biopsy obtain sigmoidoscopy quantitatively examined marker growth differentiation . In study , metabolomic microbial profile also generate fecal colon mucosal sample take baseline study endpoint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study see effect calcium-rich , multi-mineral-rich natural product , Aquamin® , derive marine algae , compare calcium alone sugar pill ( placebo ) . Investigators look whether supplement anything cell line colon . Specifically , see Aquamin® , calcium , placebo ( sugar pill ) change marker cell growth differentiation ( `` biomarkers '' ) cell colon . The natural product , Aquamin® , contain calcium , addition , significant amount magnesium measurable level approximately 70 different trace element ( essentially , everything algae accumulate seawater ) . Aquamin product market fortification food , beverage , supplement product . In study , use research therefore , use investigational . Calcium supplement show reduce colonic polyp ( precursor lesion colon cancer ) . This study NOT look polyp formation colon , biomarkers colon cell growth function . If investigator find multi-mineral natural product substantially effective calcium alone change biomarkers , possible large study could conduct intend study colon polyp prevention . In order test idea investigator need compare supplement Aquamin® , something already test ( calcium ) placebo ( sugar pill ) see change relate supplement naturally happen . There increase recognition dietary environmental predisposition colorectal cancer may mediate least part alteration gut microbial composition metabolomic profile . Human gut microbiota recognize play important role host health change composition gut microbial community link metabolic alteration affect colorectal cancer risk . Investigators previously establish dietary supplementation correlate metabolic microbial alteration recent long-term study mice high-fat western diet ( HFWD ) calcium . Investigators also demonstrate Aquamin-supplemented mouse significantly decrease liver colon tumor . Based study , investigator anticipate Aquamin improve gut microbial composition alter metabolomic profile subject . If participant agree participate research study , he/she ask sign inform consent document test perform data collect . This research study consist three time period ( phase ) : pre-treatment period ; study treatment period ; end-of-study treatment period . The study require three visit University Michigan 's Clinical Research Unit ( MCRU ) . These refer Screening Visit , Baseline Visit Final Visit . After participant determine meet eligibility requirement , randomize product receive . Randomization like flip coin . A participant equal chance ( 33.3 % ) give one three assignment : multi-mineral natural product ( Aquamin® ) ; calcium-only supplement ; placebo ( `` sugar pill '' ) . Each participant require take four capsule per day ( two take morning two evening ) 90 day . Neither study team investigator know product receiving . That information keep hand pharmacist dispenses agent participant take . - Each participant give physical examination , include measurement his/her height , weight , vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate ) . - The study nurse physician 's assistant review participant 's past medical history . - Participants ask medical condition may medication ( ) currently take . It important participant tell study personnel medication take include over-the-counter medication , calcium supplement without vitamin D , vitamin , herbal medication alternative medicine . Participants may need stop medicine order participate study . Participants instruct inform study personnel time study participation begin take medication ( ) . - Study participant ask intake food supplement contain calcium vitamin D. - Participants ask provide information regard usual food eat ( year ) , past year diet history questionnaire ( DHQ II ) - Participants ask take pregnancy test within 14 day start study woman able become pregnant . - Participants ask take calcium , vitamin D , fiber , ginger , fish oil supplement ( include multivitamin low amount ) 14 day study begin 90 day study begin . Study Treatment Period ( Baseline Visit day 90 ) The second visit take place within 60 day screen visit MCRU . This visit take 1.5 hour . During Baseline Visit , follow perform : • Each participant flexible sigmoidoscopy colon biopsy ( twelve tissue piece remove ) . At time stool sample also collect use sigmoidoscope . The flexible sigmoidoscopy do without bowel preparation use colonoscopy . A gastroenterologist routinely procedure sigmoidoscopy remove tissue / stool sample . Flexible sigmoidoscopy test allow investigator look inside colon ( large intestine ) rectum 15 centimeter ( 7 inch ) colon . For flexible sigmoidoscopy , subject lie leave side examine table . The investigator insert short , flexible , light tube rectum slowly guide colon . The tube call sigmoidoscope ( sig-MOY-duh-skope ) . The scope transmit image inside rectum colon investigator carefully examine line participant 's colon . The scope also blow air colon , inflate helps investigator see well . During flexible sigmoidoscopy , investigator remove several small piece line colon ( call colon biopsy ) use forceps instrument insert scope . Each two sigmoidoscopy procedure ( one beginning study participant complete take agent ) require twelve biopsy ( 5 mg ; size grain wheat ) . - Each participant 10 ml ( 2 teaspoon ) blood drawn vein . - Each participant request give fresh urine sample collect begin visit , sigmoidoscopy . - At end visit ( Baseline Visit ) , participant receive assign study agent instruction take study agent . Between begin study treatment period end study ( day 1 90 ) : Participants take capsule contain assign study agent ( multi-mineral natural product calcium placebo ) 90 day . This entail take total four capsule per day . The capsule take follow : Two morning two evening . It suggest take meal , require . Subjects ingest capsule much liquid choose . Participants must avoid start new medication supplement , counter calcium supplement ( without vitamin D ) , well systemic ( mouth ) corticosteroids Prednisone Cortisol . Also , participant begin course antibiotic cephalosporin antibiotic include rocephin , keflex omnicef . If participant prescribe cephalosporin antibiotic course study , discus physician study team . Also , month participant receive phone call email researcher determine whether experience problem relate study side-effects ask many capsule participant take . If participant woman able get pregnant , must use reliable method birth control throughout study . If participant think might pregnant , contact study team immediately . The study team arrange pregnancy test . End Study Treatment Period ( Final Visit ) ( Day 90 ) Within week Day-90 , participant his/her last visit MCRU . This Final Visit take 1 hour . During End Study Treatment Final Visit , follow happen : - Participants second flexible sigmoidoscopy ( twelve colon biopsy take well stool sample ) . - Participants answer questionnaire whether believe receive Aquamin® , calcium placebo capsule , untoward effect agent overall study experience . - Participants return unused capsule answer question study drug take . - Each participant 10 ml ( 2 teaspoon ) blood drawn vein . - Each participant request give fresh urine sample collect begin visit , sigmoidoscopy . - Participants tell researcher negative reaction , side-effects , problem last month study .</detailed_description>
