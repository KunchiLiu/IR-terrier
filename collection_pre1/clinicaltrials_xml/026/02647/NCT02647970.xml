	<brief_title>Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase Energy Metabolism Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In rodent well human , high stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 ( SCD1 ) activity consider involve development obesity . In animal model , polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) inhibit Scd1 gene expression population level , dietary PUFA plasma PUFA show strong inverse association plasma SCD index . Emerging evidence also suggest role sulphur amino acid cysteine regulate SCD1 activity obesity . The overall aim project examine intervention lower SCD1 activity lead increase energy metabolism . In project , investigator conduct dietary intervention trial evaluate effect short-term consumption diet rich polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) low cysteine precursor methionine ( PUFA‒Cys/Met ) vs. diet rich saturate fatty acid ( SFA ) cysteine/methionine ( SFA+Cys/Met ) SCD1 activity , lipid , amino acid , glucose biomarkers relate energy metabolism , healthy normal-weight subject . Healthy volunteer randomize PUFA‒Cys/Met SFA+Cys/Met diet receive supplements/meals single dose 7 day . This study pilot study , main focus feasibility , tolerance side effect . If pilot show positive result term side effect , safety tolerance , investigator follow-up include obese subject longer dietary intervention .</detailed_description>
