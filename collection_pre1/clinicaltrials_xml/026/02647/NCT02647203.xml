	<brief_summary>This study aim test effectiveness reduce arrest root caries lesion community-dwelling elderly subject use high fluoridate toothpaste . A double blinded RCT conduct two arm ; 5000 ppm F 1450 ppm F toothpaste . Dentifrices deliver participant blind format instruct brush twice per day . Follow-up carry every 6 month two year assess : - Root caries incidence . - Lesion arrest - Changes salivary flow - Microbiology pattern shift - Variations oral health- relate quality life OHIP-14 Sp</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background . Caries root surface ( root caries ) prevalent type dental caries older adult reportedly worrisome trend increase , teeth retain . Dental caries lead cause tooth loss among old adult . Fluoride successfully use preventive program root caries . In addition prevent root caries , fluoride-based therapy may use treat lesion . This approach know non-invasive treatment . Fluoride seem arrest promote remineralization lesion . Indeed , recent study appear indicate , high fluoride concentration effective prevent treat disease . Dentifrices high concentration fluoride appear rational approach prevent treat root caries . To chemical effect fluoride , toothbrushing add mechanical removal dental biofilm . High concentration fluoride varnish also propose effective treat carious lesion . Whether dentifrice , varnish combine use varnish fluoridate toothpaste result effective matter controversy need elucidate . Non-invasive treatment avoids complication inherent treat frail people dental setting , decrease cost importantly , allows increase coverage , therapy may deliver non-dentist personnel . Although appeal idea non-invasive treatment root caries older adult , evidence still limit research appear necessary , confirm clinical success elucidate mechanism involve lesion arrestment . Aim . To determine effectiveness non-invasive therapy root caries impact quality life old adult . Methodology . A double blind randomize control trial ( RCT ) independently-living older adult age sixty year propose . Subjects undergo clinical microbiological examination recruit ( baseline ) six-month follow-up regime completion two year . To participate , subject least five teeth expose root surface one carious lesion . Sample size calculate sample two-hundred eighty-eight older adult necessary , randomize two study arm ; Group 1 : toothpaste 1.450 ppm F- Group 2 : toothpaste 5.000 ppm F- Dependent variable . Root caries incidence activity , cariogenic bacteria oral health-related quality life assess upon completion study compare baseline score . Expected result . Based previous data available , expect non-invasive therapy root caries base low-fluoride concentration less effective high fluoride therapy inactivate root caries lesion . These result may use novel therapeutic program community level , well private practice . Furthermore , study shed light potential mechanism associate non-invasive treatment root caries , microbiology stand point . Since non-invasive approach decrease cost increase coverage dental care older adult , result may contribute increase access care usually vulnerable population old adult .</detailed_description>
