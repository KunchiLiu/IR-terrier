	<criteria>Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . The subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction likely complete study plan . Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) . There evidence cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic , biliary , gastrointestinal , renal disorder , cancer within past 5 year ( except localize situ cancer skin ) . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion report outside normal reference range healthy subject may include Investigator considers find unlikely introduce additional risk subject interfere study procedure . Male female 18 55 year age , inclusive , time signing informed consent form ( ICF ) . Body weight &gt; 50 kilogram ( kg ) ( 110 pound [ lb ] ) men &gt; 45 kg ( 99 lb ) woman body mass index ( BMI ) 18 30 kg/metersquared , inclusive , allow . AST , ALT , ALP , bilirubin , creatinine within normal reference range . If outside normal reference range , value may repeat discretion Investigator designee . WBC count ( include neutrophil count ) , haemoglobin platelet within normal reference range . If outside normal reference range , value may repeat discretion Investigator designee . Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) permit . Eligible female must meet following criterion : Nonpregnant ( confirm negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test ) ; AND Nonlactating screen prior dose ; AND Nonreproductive potential define least one follow condition : Premenopausal females without reproductive potential define one following : Documented salpingectomy , Hysterectomy , Documented bilateral oophorectomy ; Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ; A blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) estradiol level may conduct discretion Investigator site confirm nonreproductive potential . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree meet one contraception requirement time first dose study treatment last followup visit ( Part 1 Day 60 ; Part 2 Day 113 ) . Vasectomy documentation azoospermia . Male condom plus partner use one contraceptive option meet standard operate procedure ( SOP ) effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label : Contraceptive subdermal implant ; Intrauterine device intrauterine system ; Combined estrogen progestogen oral contraceptive ; Injectable progestogen ; Contraceptive vaginal ring ; Percutaneous contraceptive patch These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The Investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . History clinical evidence hypertension , significant unstable cardiac disease ( e.g. , prolonged QT syndrome [ torsade de point ] , angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , diastolic dysfunction , significant arrhythmia , coronary heart disease and/or clinically significant ECG abnormality ) . History , active diagnosis , liver disease Gilbert 's syndrome , cirrhosis , autoimmune hepatitis , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease /nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , hemochromatosis . History , active diagnosis , primary secondary ( e.g. , renal disease secondary diabetes , hypertension , vascular disease , etc . ) renal disease . History bleed diathesis coagulopathy . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : An average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit male &gt; 14 unit female . One unit equivalent 8 gram ( g ) alcohol : halfpint ( approximately 240 milliliter [ mL ] ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine 1 ( 25 mL ) measure spirit . Unwilling abstain alcohol 48 hour prior start dose last dose dose session . Regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 3 month prior screen . History sensitivity GSK3389404 component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , dietary herbal supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study treatment . Use aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) within 7 day prior first dose study treatment . A positive hepatitis C antibody . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . A positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody . Serum creatinine great upper limit normal ( ULN ) Glomerular filtration rate &lt; 90 mL/minute calculate Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration ( CKDepi ) formula Albumin creatinine ratio ( ACR ) &gt; = 0.03 milligram/milligram ( mg/mg ) . In event ACR threshold , eligibility may confirm second measurement . Qualitative test ( urinalysis ) blood urine &gt; = 0.03 mg/deciliter . In event positive test , test may repeat , negative , subject consider eligible . A positive prestudy drug screen . Unwilling refrain use illicit drug adhere protocolstated restriction participate study . Fridericia 's QT correction formula ( QTcF ) &gt; = 450 millisecond ( msec ) . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 5 halflives ( know ) twice duration ( know ) biological effect study drug ( whichever longer ) 90 day ( halflife duration unknown ) .
