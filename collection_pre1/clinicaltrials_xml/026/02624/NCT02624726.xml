	<brief_summary>Investigators propose study combination FOLFIRI plus Aflibercept Phase II trial patient metastatic colorectal cancer . The promising result aflibercept derived preclinical study clinical trial conduct patient refractory recurrent oxaliplatin-based 1st line treatment patient mCRC open field explore therapeutic approach 1st line set combination FOLFIRI regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With FOLFIRI Plus Aflibercept First Line Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer account 8 % malignant tumor adult consider major cause cancer morbidity mortality worldwide . Although curative surgical resection possible 70-80 % patient diagnosis , almost half develop local or/and metastatic recurrence die disease liver common site metastatic spread CRC . Combinations infusional administrate 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin irinotecan oxaliplatin accept mainstay first-line treatment increase median overall survival patient advance CRC 12 month 21-22 month . In addition , resection colorectal metastasis ( mainly liver ) , become standard care , patient limit metastatic disease confound liver currently remain potentially curative therapy Aflibercept , also know vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) Trap , angiogenesis inhibitor unique mechanism action . Aflibercept recombinant fusion protein consist portion human VEGFR1 VEGFR2 extracellular domain fuse Fc portion human immunoglobulin G1 . This fusion protein bind form Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A , well VEGF-B placental growth factor , additional angiogenic growth factor appear play role tumor angiogenesis inflammation . Aflibercept show bind VEGF-A , VEGF-B , placental growth factor ( PlGF ) high affinity native receptor . In vitro vivo study show aflibercept inhibit new vessel growth tumor vascularization tumor model .</detailed_description>
