	<brief_summary>Aims : - To study feasibility capsule colonoscopy patient Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) . - To compare result capsule colonoscopy conventional colonoscopy assess mucosal heal . - To correlate level faecal calprotectin result capsule colonoscopy conventional colonoscopy . - To document change clinical practice attributable capsule colonoscopy finding ) concordant b ) addition parallel finding colonoscopy ileoscopy . Project design : Cross sectional , prospective , comparative study Methodology : Patients Royal Melbourne Hospital ( RMH ) associate speciality clinic establish diagnosis CD need assessment mucosal heal consent part study undergo capsule colonoscopy conventional colonoscopy day undergo bowel preparation . The image conventional capsule colonoscopy record . In addition calprotectin ( inflammatory marker faeces ) measure sample faeces collect patient prior colonoscopy day . Professor Macrae scholarly selective student researcher ass record image obtain capsule colonoscopy image deidentified . To assess level mucosal disease use Simple Endoscopic Score CD ( SESCD ) . The result assessment mucosal healing obtain conventional colonoscopy compare capsule colonoscopy level faecal calprotectin correlate .</brief_summary>
