	<brief_summary>The introduction infliximab ( IFX ) monoclonal antibody ( MAbs ) target tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) major advancement management inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . These biologics able improve health outcomes many IBD patient treatments neither satisfactory sufficient . Despite clear advantage increase use treatment , physician still see loss response 50 % IBD patient within one year initiate therapy . Most phenomena attribute low drug concentration presence absence anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) . The fundamental issue approved/on-label dose drug therapy take account various factor impact way individual 's body respond process therapy . Dashboard software system quickly integrate patient data serve revolutionary decision-support tool physician . The Precision IFX dashboard prototype specifically developed facilitate dose therapeutic monoclonal antibody integrate patient 's clinical characteristic drug concentration pharmacokinetic ( PK ) algorithm . Using clinical observation patient laboratory , system provide multiple dose regimen could allow patient attain sustain therapeutic drug trough level . Using Precision IFX dashboard analyze forecast optimal dose regimen prospectively collect individual patient data , clinician select appropriate dose actively maintain therapeutic drug trough level throughout infliximab maintenance period . This study aim examine outcome one year maintenance infusion IBD patient dose use Precision IFX dashboard prototype compare result historical control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Therapeutic monoclonal antibody ( MAbs ) target tumor necrosis alpha pathway ( anti-TNFα , anti-TNF ) treatment immune disease rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) improve short long term clinical outcome . Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , two main subtypes IBD , chronic disease result immune dysregulation genetically susceptible individual . CD UC conventionally treat use anti-inflammatory agent include aminosalicylate base therapy ( mesalamines ) , corticosteroid , antimetabolite purine analog ( azathioprine 6-mercaptopurine ) methotrexate . A high percentage patient fail respond intolerant therapy require treatment anti-TNF . However , despite therapeutic efficacy , approximately 20 % patient show limited response induction therapy ( primary non-responders ) 50 % responder , treatment becomes ineffective maintenance therapy despite initial response ( secondary non-responders ) . Recent publication underscore substantial variability patient exposure response anti-TNF therapy administer labeled induction maintenance dose , support need individualize dose account variability ensure safe sustainable efficacy . Suboptimal exposure attribute under-dosing , rapid drug clearance and/or development anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) result primary secondary loss response ( LOR ) . Identifying individual 's effective dose adjust dos anti-TNF course treatment maintain effective concentration intuitive . Software-guided dose show effectively control dose individual patient increase efficiency clinic . Individualized adaptive dosing use PK model undertaken labor-intensive process prior use dashboard system . Several dashboard system already exist improve dose pediatric patient . Clinical use system still limit , part lack familiarity dashboard , ineffective communication practice clinical staff use benefit system facilitate decision making , resource require use model fully individualize treatment . However case pediatric patient , particularly patient dose base body size ( e.g . mg/kg mg/m2 ) , drug exposure pediatrics often substantially low adult patient make dosing metric particularly difficult patient low body weight pediatrics , show infliximab . This suggest pediatric patient would potentially garner great benefit individualized dosing . Until recently , effective use drug concentration biomarkers limit lack decision support tool allow physician integrate patient data generate treatment recommendation . Implementation adaptive Bayesian dosing clinic yet gain wide acceptance , require careful evaluation testing . However Bayesian forecast show substantially increase number patient whose trough phenytoin level within target range improve clinical outcome pediatric oncology patient . Van Lent-Evers find use Bayesian adaptive dosing aminoglycosides offer result higher antibiotic efficacy , short hospitalization , reduce incidence nephrotoxicity . The author also find low treatment cost patient dose use Bayesian approach . There number dashboard system develop recently improve treatment pediatric oncology infectious disease although yet gain widespread clinical use . From clinician 's perspective , would highly advantageous able optimize exposure MAbs patient receive therapy disease control . The advent commercially available drug ADA concentration assay indeed improve understanding patient respond lose response maintenance . With conventional weight base ( label ) dosing , investigator make assumption patient clear anti-TNF therapy rate take account inter-individual variability . A model select correct induction dose base clinical variable alter clearance allows clinician dose adjust maintenance disease activity , weight , drug concentration fluctuate course disease would helpful also economical . Consistent potential advantage dashboard , recent evaluation find individualized infliximab dose reduced treatment cost compare conventional dosing . Presently infliximab , patient escalate 5 mg/kg 10 mg/kg without necessarily consider patient may benefit increase 6 mg/kg maintain therapeutic concentration base dashboard prediction . Moreover could frequency change dose ( e.g. , every 8 week every 4 6 week ) consider rather dose escalation carry significantly cost frequent infusion . Rather wait patient declare failure indicate dosing , predictive model ensure investigator dose correctly front proactive flexible dosing regimen . The ultimate goal precision medicine utilize new information optimize therapy individual patient patient treat right dose right drug right time . Overall , approach intend maximize benefit minimize risk . Research provide wealth new information , health care provider always equip collect manage information patient care set . Thus , dashboard system may provide important decision-support tool facilitate use new information patient care . The shift conventional empirical dose adjustment dashboard facilitate dose require access model develop drug development post-marketing evaluation . However , prior routine implementation clinical use , dashboard system need design merge seamlessly current clinical practice use system need verified prospective clinical trial show benefit approach , education system make available practicing physician . Preliminary data retroactive study complete use IFX dashboard prototype show 0.70 concordance actual trough value forecast trough value use clinical profile laboratory observation first maintenance infusion . The dashboard retroactively evaluate dose regimen patient recommend every 7-8 week dose 56 % patient receive every 7-8 week . The dashboard system recommend dose decrease 52 % subject dose increase 38 % patient . Additionally , 71.4 % subject develop antibody recommend dose change and/or dose frequency change . The dashboard system actively monitor dose target drug trough level 5 µg/L standard induction period complete . By proactively monitor dose patient , study hope reduce frequency subject lose response due anti-drug antibody development increase frequency subject attain sustain therapeutic drug level .</detailed_description>
