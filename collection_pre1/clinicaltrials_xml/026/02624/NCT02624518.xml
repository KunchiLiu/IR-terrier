	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 68Ga-RM2 ( formerly know DOTA bombesin BAY 86-7548 ) PET/MRI detection recurrent prostate cancer initial therapy patient elevate prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) non-contributory compute tomography ( CT ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive 68Ga-RM2 intravenously ( IV ) begin 45 minute later undergo PET/MRI scan . The 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI may repeat completion treatment evaluate response therapy , request treat physician . After completion study , patient follow 24-48 hour 1 year .</detailed_description>
