	<detailed_description>Peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) common disease elderly , result compromise blood flow low limb . As consequence impair tissue perfusion , PAD patient experience pain , diminish exercise capacity , tissue loss , ultimately require amputation . Globally , low extremity peripheral artery disease third lead cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity , affect 200 million individual worldwide . Peripheral vascular disease become prevalent increase incidence age globally age population . In 2010 , estimate number people live peripheral artery disease increase 23.5 % last decade . The economic burden PVD significant . In United States alone , PVD account $ 20 billion annual healthcare related cost . Specifically , non-healing wound represent significant portion expenditure $ 3 billion per year . The demand development effective method characterize viability PVD wound result emergence several innovative technique . Commonly use diagnostic method ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) , pulse volume recording , duplex ultrasonography , venous plethysmography , angiography X-ray , compute tomography , magnetic resonance imaging . However , many technique lack ability triage adequately determine viability wound . Ankle brachial index ( ABI ) one common screen technique use establish presence PVD , lack sensitivity create sensitive specific categorization wound viable non-viable . ABI give indication hemodynamically significant obstruction , measure blood flow directly . Doppler ultrasound another common method measure arterial blood flow , however group suggest femoral artery blood flow may accurate hemodynamic indication muscle ischemia . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy also new technique validate application ass PVD . Novel magnetic imaging sequence PIVOT ( Perfusion , Intravascular Venous Oxygen Saturation ) combine Blood Oxygen Level Dependent ( BOLD ) MRI Arterial Spin Labeling ( ASL ) comprehensively assess tissue . Despite strengths many MRI technique promise , clinical use limitation remain due high cost availability resource . Peripheral vascular disease-induced low extremity wound inadequate perfusion . Currently , three major approach improve vascular perfusion area : medical management , open surgery , endovascular surgery . Medical management consist lifestyle modification management associate risk factor smoke , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , hypercoagulability . While advance make medical management low extremity ischemia-induced wound , large arterial revascularization remain current standard care . Open bypass surgery often employed bypass stenotic artery improve perfusion low extremity wound . Over last two decade , endovascular intervention emerge additional therapy minimally invasive may lower associate morbidity mortality . In addition improve perfusion lower extremity wound medical management surgical intervention , local wound care require expedite heal process prevent infection . However , remain need effective triage technology help clinician decide whether surgical management need . This would allow early determination surgical versus conservative management inpatient versus outpatient management . If surgery require , patient functional outcome improve take place earlier . As well , inpatient management surgical patient extremely costly . Outpatient management patient peripheral vascular wound require surgery would significantly reduce cost associated surgical intervention . Near-infrared point spectroscopy ( NIRS ) non-invasively measure flow , concentration , oxygenation hemoglobin arteriole , capillary , venule several centimeter deep tissue . NIRS safe comfortable patient well-suited measure marker viability peripheral vascular disease wound , include tissue perfusion , oxygenation hemoglobin . To date , study demonstrate validity NIRS technology patient peripheral arterial disease . The Multi spectrum infrared device ( MSID ) represent important evolution exist NIRS imaging device , design clinical environment . The MSID become commercial device produce KENT image ( Calgary , Canada ) several animal clinical trial validate use . The MSID new generation NIR image device enhance portability functionality . The MSID able monitor many variable , cytochrome oxidase marker tissue oxygen utilization , oxygen saturation , perfusion methemoglobin marker free radical injury . The advantage MSID capacity account skin colour . Melanin absorbs light attenuates amount NIR light receive camera . The Kent imaging device unique mathematical algorithm account melanin content skin . In many previous study do NIRS technology PVD wound , melanin content consider factor patient demographic predominantly Caucasian . However , many multicultural city wide variability patient melanin content , melanin correction NIRS image important . Using new clinically applicable NIRS technology design PVD , study seek identify viable non-viable wound determine severity wound assess vascular intervention indication . This technology well-suited use wound patient population measurement time short movement subject issue . As , project intend apply novel technology capacity quickly assess wound complication PVD .</detailed_description>
