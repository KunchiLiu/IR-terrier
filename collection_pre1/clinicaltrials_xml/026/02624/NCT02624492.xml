	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Age 18 year old Patients histologically confirm , relapsed/refractory , diffuse large Bcell lymphoma ( include transform follicular lymphoma ) receive antiCD20supplemented , anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy eligible high dose therapy follow autologous stem cell transplant , relaspsed/progressed autologous/allogenic stem cell transplant . Allogenic stem cell transplant perform least 6 month prior study entry allow patient require immunosuppressive treatment evidence active graftversushost disease . Patient receive antilymphoma treatment prior first dose trial medication : within past 14 day within time short equal 5 halflives drug last antilymphoma treatment contain investigational agent Screening computer tomography ( CT ) scan involvement 2 clearly demarcated lesions/nodes long axis &gt; 1.5cm Screening [ 18F ] flourodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan must demonstrate positive lesion compatible computer tomography ( CT ) define anatomical tumor site ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 Written sign inform consent consistent ICH GCP local legislation Patients must acceptable organ function Women childbearing potential must ready able use highly effective method birth control per ICH M3 ( R2 ) result low failure rate le 1 % per year use consistently correctly . Nonvasectomized male patient female sexual partner childbearing potential must ensure partner use highly effective method birth control describe , trial least 12 month end trial . Exclusion criterion : Eligible curative salvage high dose therapy follow stem cell transplant Primary central nervous system lymphoma known Central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement Prior history malignancy DLBCL except basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ uterine cervix breast treat curative therapy . Other prior malignancy allow patient free disease without treatment hormone least past three year . Refractory gemcitabine and/or oxaliplatin Contraindications gemcitabine , oxaliplatin and/or rituximab judge investigator . Hypersensitivity oxaliplatin Unresolved toxicity CTCAE grade &gt; 1from prior antilymphoma therapy ( except alopecia ) Significant concurrent medical disease condition accord investigator judgment would either compromise patient safety interfere evaluation safety test drug . e.g . symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia require therapy exception extra systole minor conduction abnormalities An infection require treatment start trial medication . Active hepatitis B hepatitis C , laboratory evidence chronic infection HIV infection ( test result do routine diagnostics acceptable do within 14 day first study treatment dose ) Women pregnant , nursing , plan become pregnant trial.This include female sexual partner male participant Known alcohol drug abuse could potentially interfere trial participation accord investigator judgment Prior treatment CD37 antibody</criteria>
