	<brief_summary>Toxicities relate pediatric cancer treatment lead significant illness , organ damage , treatment delay , increase health care cost , decrease quality life . Such toxicity largely due tissue damage sustain chemotherapy , strategy design limit cellular damage normal tissue may reduce therapy-related morbidity mortality . In addition vitro vivo anti-cancer effect , naturally occur soy isoflavones anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant property , show reduce side effect therapy adult oncology clinical trial . This study examine effect genistein , major isoflavone component soybean extensively study soy isoflavones , short-term side effect myelosuppressive chemotherapy pediatric cancer patient . Subjects randomize receive either : ) 30 mg genistein daily throughout chemotherapy Cycles 1 2 placebo chemotherapy Cycles 3 4 ; b ) placebo daily chemotherapy Cycles 1 2 30 mg genistein daily chemotherapy Cycles 3 4 . Investigators hypothesize subject few short-term therapy-related side effect cycle chemotherapy give conjunction genistein supplementation cycle give placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Genistein Pediatric Oncology Patients ( UVA-Gen001 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled crossover study evaluate effect soy isoflavones short term untoward effect myelosuppressive chemotherapy use treat pediatric cancer . Newly diagnose cancer patient age 1-21 year register study informed consent obtain prior study-related procedure . Stratification base length chemotherapy cycle , 14 day 21 day cycle . Within stratum registered subject randomize 1:1 one two schedule : Arm A : Subjects receive genistein daily throughout chemotherapy cycle 1 2 , placebo chemotherapy cycle 3 4 Arm B : Subjects receive placebo daily throughout chemotherapy cycle 1 2 , genistein chemotherapy cycle 3 4 Subjects assess safety efficacy cycle clinical lab , cytokine panel , physical exam . Drug compliance monitor use patient diary well monitor serum genistein level . Adverse event monitor start Cycle 1 Day 1 30 day follow last day protocol therapy ( genistein/placebo ) .</detailed_description>
