	<detailed_description>Study design Participants The investigator randomly assign participant consume one two novel flavor , high-sugar beverage daily 3-week period . The study include fMRI behavioral assessment pre-/post-intervention 9 study visit intervention period . 20 , healthy-weight , young adult ( 10 female , 10 male ; x̅ age = 23.3±3.4 ; x̅ BMI = 22.1±1.9 ; 5 % Hispanic,10 % Asian/Pacific Islanders , 85 % European Americans ) complete protocol see Figure 1a . Exclusion criterion body mass index ( BMI ; kg/m2 ) &lt; 18.5 &gt; 26.5 , sweeten ( artificial caloric ) beverage consumption &gt; 6 times/week , tobacco/e-cigarette use &gt; 6 times/week , psychoactive medication drug &gt; 1 time/month , pregnancy , head injury loss consciousness , significant cognitive impairment , major medical problem , endorsement disorder eating current Axis I psychiatric disorder assess online screener . Participants provide write informed consent ; method procedure approve University North Carolina Chapel Hill 's Institutional Review Board . Intervention Interested participant complete brief online screen survey appear qualify schedule baseline visit inclusion exclusion confirm consent reviewed obtain . Participants randomly assign one two juice condition , stratify sex . Once consent , participant complete behavioral perceptual measure baseline behavioral assessment . On separate day participant complete baseline neuroimaging assessment . The day follow neuroimaging assessment participant begin intervention period consume assigned juice daily 3-week period . During intervention period participant come lab every Monday , Wednesday Friday ( 9 total assessment ) : consume portion day 's juice lab , complete perceptual measure weight assessment , pick follow day ( ) juice , return empty bottle previous day ( ) . On Fridays , participant give two bottle consume instruct consume one per day return bottle follow Monday . Empty bottle return increase compliance . The follow-up neuroimaging assessment schedule participant complete 3-week intervention , consume juice 24 hour scan . The follow-up behavioral assessment occur within three day follow-up scan Figure 1b . Beverages select : sweeten sugar , i.e. , include high fructose corn syrup , and/or artificial sweetener , artificial flavor , color preservative , calorically equivalent common sugar-sweetened beverage ( e.g. , soft drink ) , caffeine- texture-free , generally novel flavor . The juice eucaloric , similar palatability , easily distinguishable one another . Prior study initiation , pilot taste test complete small sample insure novelty equal palatability two juice include study . The result two beverage : Apple-Cherry-Berry juice Orange-Tangerine-Passionfruit juice . The 10 fl oz bottle juice contain 133 kcals , 31g sugar . The juice logos select novel , similar visual complexity , black white , convey information beyond unique symbol , yet easily distinguishable one another . Each juice present individual 10 fl oz bottle identifier sticker associate logo .</detailed_description>
