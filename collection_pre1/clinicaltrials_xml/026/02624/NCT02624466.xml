	<brief_summary>Children chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) suffer one devastating diseases childhood result lifelong need health care , 3 time decreased life expectancy . In addition , important comorbidities negatively impact quality life integration society , jeopardize future even potential transplantation . Retention uraemic toxin accept play major role pathogenesis comorbid condition , study child lack . Furthermore , currently good tool evaluate severity monitor adequacy treatment , result suboptimal management . The overall scientific objective four year UToPaed IWT-TBM project provide clinician new diagnostic therapeutic tool management child CKD , base improve understanding uraemic toxicity . In first part UToPaed , investigator associate concentration wide variety uraemic toxin different comorbidities CKD child , i.e . growth , protein-energy wasting , quality life , cardiovascular risk factor , circadian rhythm , sleep quality , psychosocial neurocognitive functioning ( i.e . cross-sectional longitudinal ) . The toxin concentration best correlate comorbidities progress CKD eventually representative kinetics ( UToPaed - part 2 : Kinetic analysis ) select marker . These marker , together comorbidities , track intervention , i.e . start dialysis , transplantation , change dialysis strategy ( UToPaed - part 3 - intervention study ) . From validate kinetic model ( UToPaed - part 2 3 ) , open access user-friendly prediction simulator ( PAEDSIM ) base patient characteristic marker concentration develop optimise individualise dialysis therapy . By provide clinician advanced appropriate tool improve management child CKD , i.e . well assessment degree renal dysfunction , good determination ideal time start renal replacement therapy , accurate monitoring dialysis adequacy , investigator aim improve neurocognitive psychosocial functioning ( short term ) , growth , maturation puberty , social integration ( median term ) survival ( long term ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uraemic Toxins Chronic Kidney Disease Paediatric Patients : Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective observational multicenter study child ( ≤ 18 year ) chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) stage 2 5D without renal replacement therapy . In study , 60 child CKD stage 2 - 5 ( without renal replacement therapy ) ( GROUP 1 ) , 30 child CKD stage 5D treated peritoneal dialysis ( GROUP 2 ) 30 child CKD stage 5D treat haemodialysis ( GROUP 3 ) follow total duration 24 month . The study participant evaluate standard visit outpatient clinic every 3 month . At visit , blood sample uraemic toxin concentration withdraw several co-morbidities ( growth , protein-energy wasting , cardiovascular disease , quality life , psychosocial functioning , sleep , attention executive function ) assess . Anthropometric parameter , dietary assessment , stool evaluation , nail evaluation , office 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring , echocardiography questionnaire use map several co-morbidities . Blood analysis perform get concentration wide variety uraemic toxin : i.e . small water soluble solute , middle molecule protein-bound solute . All blood analysis within project perform Ghent University Hospital : i.e . urea , creatinine , calcium , phosphorus determine routine laboratory Ghent University Hospital use standard method , uraemic toxin determine laboratory Nephrology Section use ELISA ( in-house develop ) HPLC/UPLC technique . For protein-bound solute two run need distinguish total free fraction protein-bound solute . The following action perform prior enrolment : - Review medical history determine eligibility base inclusion/exclusion criterion - Obtain document consent participant ( &gt; 12 year ) parent/representative study consent form - Schedule study visit individual eligible available duration study - Provide potential participant instruction need prepare first study visit Baseline visit : - Verify inclusion/exclusion criterion . - Obtain record general patient information : age , sex , medical history , underlie kidney disease , medication history , current medication chart , dialysis setting demographic information - Assessment dietary assessment skilled dietician mean 3-day diet diary three 24-hours recall - Perform clinical assessment include anthropometric parameter office blood pressure - Perform body composition monitoring ( BCM ) child &gt; 10 kg - Collection blood sample ( group ; EDTA immediately ice ; serum 15-30 minute rest subsequently ice ) , 24 hour urine sample ( group 2 ; 24 hour prior visit ) , intradialytic urine sample ( group 3 ) 24 hour dialysate collection ( group 2 ; 24 hour prior visit ) determination uraemic toxin concentration Intermediate visit : - Obtain general patient information : medication chart , change medical situation dialysis setting - Assessment dietary intake skilled dietician mean 3-day diet diary three 24-hours recall every 3 month - Perform clinical assessment include anthropometric parameter office blood pressure - Perform BCM 3-monthly child &gt; 10 kg renal replacement therapy ( group 2 3 ) 1-yearly child &gt; 10 kg without renal replacement therapy ( group 1 ) - Collection blood sample ( group 1 3 ; EDTA immediately ice ; serum 15-30 minute rest subsequently ice ) , 24 hour urine sample ( group 2 3 ; 24 hour prior visit ) 24 hour dialysate collection ( group 2 ; 24 hour prior visit ) every 3 month determination uraemic toxin concentration . - Collection stool sample determination microbiota metabolome 1-yearly ( participant Ghent University Hospital ) - Collection nail determination carbamylation process every 6 month ( participant Ghent University Hospital ) - Perform echocardiography skilled paediatric cardiologist every year ( visit 2 , 5 ) - Withdraw questionnaire parent and/or child assess quality life , attention , sleep , executive function parental functioning every 6 month ( visit 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) - Perform 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement child &gt; 6 year year ( visit 2 , 5 ) Final Study Visit : - Obtain general patient information : medication chart , change medical situation dialysis setting ( detailed overview appendix 2 ) - Assessment dietary assessment skilled dietician mean 3-day diet diary three 24-hours recall - Perform clinical assessment include anthropometric parameter office blood pressure - Perform body composition monitoring ( BCM ) child &gt; 10 kg - Collection blood sample ( group 1 3 ; EDTA immediately ice ; serum 15-30 minute rest subsequently ice ) , 24 hour urine sample ( group 2 3 ; 24 hour prior visit ) 24 hour dialysate collection ( group 2 ; 24 hour prior visit ) determination uraemic toxin concentration - Perform echocardiography skilled paediatric cardiologist - Perform 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement child &gt; 6 year The following socio-demographic questionnaire ask complete : 1 . Assessment quality life ( QoL ) - PedsQL child ( 5-18 year ) - PedsQL child , disease specific ( 8-12 year , 13-18 year ) - Parent Proxy Report parent ( 2-4 year , 5-7 year , 8-12 year , 13-18 year ) - Parent Proxy Report , disease specific parent ( 8-12 year , 13-18 year ) 2 . Assessment psychological wellbeing - YSR child ( &gt; 11 year ) - CBCL/TRF parent/teachers ( 1,5-5 year , 6-18 year ) - CBSK child ( 8-12 year ) , CBSA child ( 13-18 year ) 3 . Assessment attention &amp; executive function - DBDRS parent , teacher ( 6-16 year ) - BRIEF parents/teachers ( 5-18 year ) 4 . Assessment sleep - ESS questionnaire parent - CSHQ questionnaire parent 5 . Assessment family function - PIP parent - HADS parent - PSI-S parent - PPS parent - CVS parent</detailed_description>
