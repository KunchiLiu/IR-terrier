	<brief_title>A Study Determine Safety Efficacy RSV F Vaccine Protect Infants Via Maternal Immunization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , observer-blind , placebo-controlled group-sequential design trial enrol third-trimester pregnant woman Northern Southern hemispheres , four consecutive RSV season hemisphere . The trial project enroll estimate maximum 8,618 third-trimester pregnant subject , number may small base operation group-sequential design , incidence rate primary clinical endpoint event , efficacy intervention . Women third trimester singleton uncomplicated pregnancy 18 40 year age ( inclusive ) enrol randomized 1:1 ratio one two treatment group , active placebo , approximately three month prior peak RSV season . After first global season enrollment , randomization scheme change 2:1 ( active/placebo ) ratio enable efficient accrual safety database . All maternal subject receive single intramuscular ( IM ) injection Day 0 assign test article , RSV F vaccine placebo . Study participation maternal subject span approximately nine ( 9 ) month first dose , end six ( 6 ) month post-delivery . Study follow-up infant subject consent span approximately one ( 1 ) year post-delivery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . ≥18 ≤40 yearsofage 2 . Singleton pregnancy 28 36 0/7 week gestation day plan vaccination Documentation gestational age base one follow composite criterion . ( Note : The Investigator use early ultrasound data available establish studyspecific gestational age date ) : 1 . Gestational Age Dating Based First Trimester Data ( data obtain ≤13 6/7 week ) : The date first day report last menstrual period ( LMP ) may use estable gestational age corroborate first trimester ultrasound . If gestational age estimation derive use LMP first trimester ultrasound discrepant &gt; 7 day , ultrasound use establish gestational age . If LMP uncertain unknown , ultrasoundestablished gestational age estimation use establish gestational age pregnancy . 2 . Gestational Age Dating Based Early Second Trimester Data ( data obtain 14 0/7 21 6/7 week ) : The day first report LMP may use establish gestational age corroborate early second trimester ultrasound ( estimate gestational age 14 0/7 21 6/7 week ) . If gestational age estimation derive use LMP early second trimester ultrasound discrepant &gt; 10 day , ultrasound use establish gestational age . If LMP uncertain unknown , ultrasoundestablished gestational age estimation use establish gestational age pregnancy . 3 . Gestation Age Dating Based Later Second Trimester Data ( data obtain 22 0/7 27 6/7 week LMP ) : The date first day report LMP may use establish gestation age corroborate later second trimester ultrasound ( estimate gestational age 22 0/7 27 6/7 week ) . If gestational age estimation derive use LMP later second trimester ultrasound discrepant &gt; 14 day , ultrasound use establish gestational age . If LMP uncertain unknown , ultrasoundestablished gestational age estimation use establish gestational age pregnancy . 4 . Gestational Age Dating When LMP Uncertain Unknown AND No Prior First Second Trimester Ultrasound Has Been Performed : An ultrasound perform screen within second trimester ( ≤27 6/7 week ) use establish gestational age pregnancy . 3 . Documentation second third ( 18 0/7 week prior randomization ) trimester ultrasound major fetal anomaly identify . 4 . Good general maternal health demonstrate : Medical history ( include history adverse reaction prior vaccine allergy ) . Physical examination include least vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , respiration , oral temperature ) ; weight ; height ; examination HEENT , cardiovascular , pulmonary , gastrointestinal ( abdominal ) , musculoskeletal , lymphatic , dermatologic organ system ; documentation fetal heart tone . Note abnormal vital sign may repeat investigator 's discretion since measure may labile . Vital sign assess context normal value third trim pregnancy ( see Study Operations Manual ) . Clinical laboratory parameter include : For first year study conduct country , normal/clinically insignificant blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , hemoglobin , white blood count , platelet count . Note normal range clinical laboratory parameter base reference range appropriate subject population study ( i.e. , third trimester pregnancy ) define toxicity grade scale ( TGS ) ( see Study Operations Manual ) . For subject , serologic exclusion infection hepatitis B ( HBV ) C ( HCV ) viruses , syphilis , HIV document test ( performed central local laboratory ) screen medical record current pregnancy . 5 . Able understand , willing physically able comply study procedure . This include anticipation reasonable geographic proximity study clinic adequate transportation comply schedule unscheduled study followup visit . 6 . Able willing provide write informed consent infant . 1 . Symptomatic cardiac pulmonary disease require chronic drug therapy , include hypertension asthma . Asthma exclusionary subject receive chronic systemic glucocorticoid dose inhaled glucocorticoid dose &gt; 500µg per day beclomethasone fluticasone , &gt; 800μg per day budesonide . 2 . Pregnancy complication ( current pregnancy ) preterm labor , hypertension ( blood pressure [ BP ] &gt; 140/90 presence proteinuria BP &gt; 150/100 without proteinuria ) currently antihypertensive therapy preeclampsia ; evidence intrauterine growth restriction . 3 . Grade 2 high clinical laboratory vital sign abnormality . Exclusion subject grade 1 abnormality base subject 's prior medical history investigator 's clinical judgment abnormality indicative meaningful physiologic event . 4 . Receipt license vaccine ( e.g. , Tdap , inactivate influenza vaccine ) within 14 day study vaccination . 5 . Received RSV vaccine time . 6 . Body mass index ( BMI ) ≥40 , time screen visit . 7 . Hemoglobinopathy ( even asymptomatic ) blood dyscrasia . 8 . Hepatic renal dysfunction . 9 . Established diagnosis seizure disorder , regardless therapy . 10 . Known , active autoimmune disease immunodeficiency syndrome . 11 . Endocrine disorder , include ( limited ) untreated hyperthyroidism , untreated hypothyroidism ( unless due autoimmune disease ) , glucose intolerance ( e.g. , diabetes mellitus type 1 2 ) antedate pregnancy , occur pregnancy require intervention diet control . 12 . History major gynecologic major abdominal surgery , include bariatric surgery ( previous Caesarean section exclusion ) . 13 . Known HIV , syphilis , HBV , HCV infection , assess serologic test conduct current pregnancy procedure screen period study . 14 . Primary genital Herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection current pregnancy . 15 . Current alcohol drug abuse base Investigator 's knowledge present recent ( within last 2 year ) use/abuse alcohol illegal nonprescription drug . 16 . Documentation current pregnancy result vitro fertilization ( IVF ) . 17 . Documentation current pregnancy result rape incest . 18 . Documentation infant ward state release adoption . 19 . History/presence deep venous thrombosis thromboembolism , use anticoagulant pregnancy ( use lowdose aspirin prophylaxis [ e.g. , prevention morbidity mortality preeclampsia ] acceptable dosage consistent local standard care ) . 20 . Red blood cell alloimmunization . 21 . Prior stillbirth neonatal death , multiple ( ≥3 ) spontaneous abortion . 22 . Prior preterm delivery ≤34 week gestation ongoing intervention ( medical/surgical ) current pregnancy prevent preterm birth . 23 . Greater five ( 5 ) prior delivery . 24 . Previous infant know genetic disorder major congenital anomaly . 25 . Receipt investigational drug immune globulin ( exception prophylactic antiRho D immune globulin ) within six ( 6 ) month prior administration study vaccine . 26 . Chronic administration ( define 14 continuous day ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug within 6 month prior administration study vaccine . An immunosuppressant dose glucocorticoid define systemic dose ≥10mg prednisone per day equivalent . The use topical , inhaled , nasal glucocorticoid permit except limit establish exclusion criterion # 1 . 27 . Neuropsychiatric illness deem likely interfere protocol compliance , safety reporting , receipt prenatal care ; require treatment psychotropic drug ( exclude treatment depression anxiety ) . 28 . Any physical , psychiatric social condition may , investigator 's opinion , increase risk study participation maternal subject fetus/infant ; may lead collection incomplete inaccurate safety data . 29 . Acute disease within 72 hour day plan vaccination ( define presence moderate severe illness without fever , oral temperature &gt; 38.0°C ) . 30 .
