	<brief_summary>Background Anorectal malformation ( ARM ) rare cover congenital defective development rectum . ARM include range congenital condition may vary degree involve anorectum . A significant part malformation organs mainly urinary tract . In vast majority ARM recognize birth lack normal anus . The primary approach construction stoma subsequent reconstruction . Bowel continuity typical restore 4-6 month . Many patient experience abnormal bowel function later affect quality life ( QoL ) . Aim The primary objective ass patient-related outcome 10-30 year surgery ARM see related exist damage anorectum bowel function . The secondary objective identify problem bowel function may treat medically surgery improve bowel function QoL . To obtain necessary knowledge study divide follow sub-projects : 1 . Assessment bowel function QoL relevant questionnaires 2 . Examine sphincter anatomy function rectal ultrasound , magnetic resonans ( MR ) -scan pelvis anal manometry . Bowel function assess colonic transit time . Screening urinary tract problem uroflowmetry . Methods Participants identify relevant diagnostic code ( Q 42 ) patient underwent surgery ARM year 1985-2005 include informed consent obtain . Relevant questionnaire regard symptom QoL complete follow examination : - Anal manometry - Anal ultrasound - Pudenda conduction velocity - Colonic transit time - Magnetic resonans ( MR ) -scan low abdomen pelvis - Uroflowmetry Bowel function QoL assess child adult relevant validated questionnaire . Perspective No danish study foreign investigate relationship anatomy/physiology quality life surgery anorectal malformation . The investigator believe study include comprehensive examination clarify cause functional problem surgery anorectal malformation . Results questionnaires regard symptom , disease-specific-and general quality life offer unique opportunity target treatment improve symptom QoL patient ARM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim Endpoints The primary endpoint outcome 10-30 year surgery anorectal malformation see related exist altered anatomy , anorectal function intestinal passage . The secondary endpoint identify bowel function problem treat medicine surgery improve patient bowel function quality life . To obtain necessary knowledge study divide follow Sub-projects : 1 . Evaluation bowel function quality life relevant questionnaire . 2 . Examine anorectal anatomy function anal ultrasound , Magnetic resonans ( MR ) -scan small pelvis anal manometry . Overall bowel function examine colonic transit time . Screening urinary problem urodynamic test . Background Anorectal malformation ( ARM ) cover wide spectrum congenital disorder see sex may also involve urinary tract genitals . It occur 1/2500 newborn slight predominance boys 2/3 accompany anomaly . ARM form abnormal development hindgut later form descend colon , rectum , anus , bladder urethra . This explain frequent recurrence accompany malformation urinary tract . The reason development ARM unknown . The etiology probably multifactorial include heredity environment . A chromosomal anomaly find among 5 % patient ARM Trisomy 21 common . Possible risk factor maternal fever first trimester , industrial exposure solvent , paternal smoking , maternal obesity diabetes . Accompanying anomaly often involve organ system . The mortality among patient ARM 10-20 % primary see high malformation severe associate anomaly include cardiac . Previously classification ARM base upon sex position rectum relative levator ani muscle high , intermediate low ( Wingspread classification ) . Pena colleague suggest mid 90 classification system base presence fistula . Later Krickenbeck classification system introduce classify ARM base appearance , surgical approach symptom . The classic surgical approach consist early divergent stoma , later surgical correction finally closure stoma.The classic surgical treatment intermediate high ARM abdominoperineal pull-through technique . Later Pena colleague introduce posterior sagittal anorectal plasty ( PSARP ) . PSARP adapt Odense University hospital 1994 still preferred surgical approach . Last laparoscopic assist anorectal pull-through ( LAARP ) introduce gain common accept . Functional problem ARM primary fecal incontinence high constipation low malformations.Treatment primary medical dietetic regulation bowel treatment-resistent case anal irrigation appendicostomy antegrade colonic irrigation . Sometimes permanent stoma may need . Different image technique physiological measure use clarify anatomy bowel function surgical correction ARM . MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) pelvis show difference patient constipation fecal incontinence surgery ARM . MRI provide useful information regard pelvic musculature , colonic anatomy accompany disorder . Anal ultrasound manometry useful evaluate anatomy function anal sphincter . Scar tissue formation defect anal sphincter correlate pressure anal canal fecal incontinence . A recent technique evaluate anorectal neuromuscular function High Resolution Anorectal Manometry ( HRAM ) . HRAM previously proven accurate display anorectal anatomy compare water-perfused manometry . Colonic transit time provide information motility disorder patient constipation colonic hypomobility observe . Pudendal nerve conduction velocity useful evaluate fecal incontinence delay conduction velocity observe . An essential issue regard ARM quality life ( QoL ) . A literature review Witvliet colleague show 20 % publish study use validated questionnaire . ( 30 ) Nine 30 included study QoL perform adult population . Poyet colleague find Health Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) affect among patient age one four year compare control group surgery ARM . Hartmann et al . find change period three year adult population . Women , old patient , patient defect patient stoma report reduced QoL . Statistics It mainly descriptive study therefore power calculation neither possible relevant . In recruitment period average 10 patient undergone surgery annually University Hospital Odense . The investigator expect 50 % patient participate population would one large yet see . It possible prove clinical relevant difference ( 20 % ) correlation different operative technique . Further possible prove correlation symptoms outcome different image technique , examination questionnaire . Questionnaires Symptoms QoL assess questionnaire . Bowel function surgery anorectal malformation evaluate Krickenbeck Classification . In adult also Wexner ` Incontinence score Cleveland Clinic Constipation Score ( CCCS ) . Disease-specific QoL adult assess Fecal Incontinence QoL ( FIQL ) general QoL EQ-5D-5L . In participant 18 year age general QoL assess Strenght Difficulties Questionnaire ( SDQ ) . Urinary function impact quality life adult evaluate International Consultation Incontinence Modular Questionnaire - Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms ( ICIQ-FLUTS ) International Consultation Incontinence Modular Questionnaire - Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms ( ICIQ-MLUTS ) . Sexual function assess International Index Erectile Dysfunction ( IIEF ) woman Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) . Only Danish version questionnaire use . Course plan The project run three year ( 2014-2017 ) intend subject complete examination July 2016 . The participant ask fill different questionnaire regard bowel habit , symptom QoL . There plan hospitalization participant two day may stay overnight patient hotel home . Initially medical history obtain , clinical examination perform questionnaire collect . Perspective No danish study foreign investigate relationship anatomy/physiology quality life surgery anorectal malformation . The investigator believe study include comprehensive examination clarify cause functional problem surgery anorectal malformation . Results questionnaires regard symptom , disease-specific-and general quality life offer unique opportunity target treatment improve symptom QoL patient ARM .</detailed_description>
