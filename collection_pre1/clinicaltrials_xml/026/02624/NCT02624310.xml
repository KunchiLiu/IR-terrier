	<brief_summary>The aim study increase norepinephrine level population young adult NE level low undetectable . In order achieve , optimal dose determine titration step . In titration step , different dos L-DOPS test order find optimal safest dose suitable individual enrol study . Because L-DOPS never use US child young adult , titration step investigator also determine safe dose population . Currently , L-DOPS use center treat othostatic hypotension autonomic failure . The titration step study start dose 100 mg increase escalate manner maximum 600 mg day ( see investigational brochure attach ) . L-DOPS develop capsule oral use previous safety data perform use route . Oral route one use study . Carbidopa well tolerate , safe child use population US without severe adverse effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Norepinephrine Patients With Congenital Insensitivity Pain Anhidrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CIPA patient low undetectable level norepinephrine plasma also significant cognitive behavioral problem . The aim project increase NE level brain evaluate increase improve cognitive cognition behavior . Both drug study never use CIPA patient , therefore important evaluate safety tolerability L-DOPS carbidopa population . Even NE level low plasma CIPA subject , know NE level also low central nervous system . It likely also case , however , level NE brain check one CIPA subject prof concept . Study overview : Patients CIPA screen enrol ( visit 1 ) part 1 pilot trial . Safety parameter include , adverse event , blood chemistry renal liver function testing , 12 lead electrocardiogram , temperature , weight blood pressure ( supine , seated standing ) , non-verbal intelligence behavior test , 24 hour urinary catecholamine excretion plasma dopamine level measure baseline . The patient enter open-label dose titration phase ( visit 2a , b , c , , e , f ) adverse event continuously monitor . After reach dose 100 mg/day dose , patient question adverse event blood pressure ( supine , sit stand ) measure . If adverse event abnormality detect patient continue dose titration . Safety assessment repeat safety blood obtain patient reach maximum tolerate dose . After completion dose titration , patient able tolerate L-DOPS enter second open-label dose titration phase carbidopa titrate ( visit 3a , b , c , , e , f ) . A period two week allow washout L-DOPS start carbidopa titration . Carbidopa previously use clinical study child , young adult adult group adverse effect report . There reason think carbidopa may unsafe CIPA patient , however , aim titration step check safety tolerability drug population . Subjects receive dose 100 mg/day question adverse event blood pressure ( supine , sit stand ) measure . If adverse event abnormality detect patient continue dose titration . In follow step , dose carbidopa increase 100 mg daily total 600 mg/day . Safety assessment repeat safety blood obtain patient reach total daily dose 600 mg/day . In final phase titration , L-DOPS carbidopa administer ( visit 4a , b , c , , e ) . The start dose L-DOPS maximum tolerate dose L-DOPS titration step . The dose carbidopa administer L-DOPS maximum tolerate dose . L-DOPS increase 100 mg/day 600 mg/day , unless adverse affect observe titration stop dose L-DOPS . The dose carbidopa maximum tolerated titration increase . After reach maximum L-DOPS/carbidopa tolerate dose , patient question adverse event medication blood pressure ( supine , sit stand ) measure . After safety evaluation adverse event abnormality observe patient continue study . A period two week allow washout L-DOPS/carbidopa start placebo-controlled double-blind cross phase . Patients successfully complete titration proceed randomized placebo control phase . Before proceed part , researcher review safety data titration . Patients randomize double-blind fashion , receive either L-DOPS/carbidopa matching placebo . Patients take medication 4 week . After 4 week , 24 urinary catecholamine excretion , plasma dopamine level , behavior score , safety parameter adverse event measure ( visit 5 ) , patient cross ( visit 6 ) . A similar dose withdrawal scheme implement prevent adverse effect acute withdrawal . Patients follow 4-weeks . After completion cross period , patient undergo final evaluation ( visit 7 ) safety efficacy measure repeat . To conclude study , 2 week complete pilot-trial , patient receive follow phone call monitor adverse event . All necessary safety information report FDA accordance 312.32 IND safety report outline Title 21 Food Drugs .</detailed_description>
