	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Therapeutic Potential Stem Cell Educator Therapy Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our previous work demonstrate human cord blood-derived multipotent stem cell ( CB-SCs ) unique type stem cell identify human cord blood , distinct stem cell type include hematopoietic stem cell ( HSCs ) , mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) . The stem cell harness unique property Stem Cell Educator therapy use CB-SCs closed-loop system circulate patient 's blood blood cell separator , briefly co-cultures patient 's lymphocyte adherent CB-SCs vitro , return `` educate '' lymphocyte ( CB-SCs ) patient 's circulation . This treatment lead global immune modulation immune balance demonstrate clinical data animal study . The Stem Cell Educator therapy may revolutionize clinical treatment diabetes immune-related disease CB-SCs ' immune education induction immune balance , without safety ethical concern associate conventional stem cell-based approach</detailed_description>
