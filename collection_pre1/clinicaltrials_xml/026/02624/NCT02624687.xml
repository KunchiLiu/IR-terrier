Preliminary evidence suggest prolong sit work exacerbate LBP , LBP relieve shortly prolong sit end , stand work relieve pain . Thus , proposal examine innovative intervention decrease pain patient chronic LBP ( cLBP ) reduction sedentary behavior . The target population University Pittsburgh ( UPitt ) employee cLBP inactive sit desk â‰¥20 hours/week . Over 6 month , individual provide workstation allow stand perform work duty , wrist-worn activity device vibrates prolong sedentariness , behavioral intervention include initial orientation monthly follow-up telephone contact . This novel pain reduction approach easily incorporate workplace target timeframe prolonged sit common . A unique aspect approach individual cLBP avoid movement due pain may especially benefit emerge strategy frequent , lifestyle activity facilitate newly-available device . The investigator hypothesize intervention reduce pain intensity thereby lead increase work productivity , decrease healthcare utilization , improve health-related quality life , improved physical function LBP sufferer .
