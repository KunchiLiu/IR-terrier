	<detailed_description>The laparoscopic approach pediatric appendectomy gain popularity demonstrate reduce complication improve resource utilization . The procedure document association high postoperative pain intensity , associate substantial pain ( pain score &gt; 4 &gt; 60 % time ) 33 % patient . This due surgical manipulation , also intraperitoneal insufflation carbon dioxide require laparoscopy result peritoneal stretching , diaphragmatic irritation , change intra-abdominal pH well retention insufflation gas abdominal cavity surgery . Opioid analgesic , especially morphine , common pharmacological option treat postoperative pain pediatric patient . Although morphine generally consider safe use pediatric patient , physicians caregiver often hesitate prescribe administer opioids perceive risk addiction undesirable side effect . Efforts mitigate use opioids systemic analgesia surgery appear warrant . The topical administration analgesics/anesthetics via peritoneum biologically advantageous intra-abdominal gas insufflation resultant increase intra-abdominal pressure generate peritoneal inflammation neuronal rupture linear relationship abdominal compliance procedure severity postoperative pain . Intraperitoneal nebulization local anesthetic agent relatively novel approach pain management laparoscopy . Intraperitoneal nebulization local anesthetic allows uniform dispersion agent throughout peritoneum combine analgesic benefit gas condition local anesthetic instillation . Microvibration-based aerosol humidification device ( i.e . cold nebulization ) deliver significant amount local anesthetic abdominal cavity . Animal study confirm safety bioavailability nebulized ropivicaine abdominal cavity . The pharmacokinetics nebulized ropivacaine 3 mg/kg similar instill ropivacaine maximal ropivacaine concentration find lie well within safe range . Human study confirm favorable pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics nebulized ropivacaine . Peak concentration attain 10 30 minute follow end aerosolize ropivacaine delivery . Aerosolized intraperitoneal local anesthetic feasible , ropivacaine concentration remain within safe level . In previous randomize controlled trial adult , nebulization ropivacaine 30 mg Aeroneb Pro system either laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces postoperative pain ( effect size - 33 % - 50 % ) well completely prevents shoulder pain compare nebulization saline . Patients receive ropivacaine nebulization consume significantly less morphine control group ( effect size 40 % -56 % ) . Patients receive ropivacaine nebulization mobilize quicker receive placebo 33 % reduction unassisted walking time surgery . The duration analgesia pre- postoperative nebulization ( 48 hour ) significantly longer expected duration ropivacaine , base mechanism action . No adverse event report conduct trial . Ropivicaine nebulization also evaluate context gynecological surgery ; patient receive Ropivacaine 30 mg surgical stimulation report significantly less postoperative pain ( -50 % ) consume significant less morphine ( -40 % ) walk without assistance receive ropivacaine instillation first 24 hour surgery . Furthermore , administration intraperitoneal aerosolized bupivacaine prior incise peri-renal fascia appear simple , effective low-cost method reduce postoperative pain child undergo laparoscopic pyeloplasty child . Given consistently safe favorable result document adult patient , work study hypothesis intra-abdominal administration nebulized ropivacaine immediately onset surgery reduce post-operative pain morphine consumption laparoscopic appendectomy child adolescent .</detailed_description>
