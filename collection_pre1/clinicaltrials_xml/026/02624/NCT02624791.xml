	<brief_summary>Small amount astigmatism often uncorrected contact lens wearer . The effect respect drive unknown , could threaten safe operation motor vehicle , especially condition nighttime drive visual ability highly challenge . This study measure driving-specific visual ability simulate drive performance participant astigmatism either astigmatism correct . The primary hypothesis tactical level , contact lens correct astigmatism result safer drive performance overall . The secondary hypothesis operational level , contact lens correct astigmatism result well driving-specific visual performance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Safe drive relies heavily `` good vision . '' Good vision drive relates multiple ability , dynamic visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , management glare peripheral vision , etc . While spherical contact lenses address issue correction visual acuity determine forward static vision test , provide visual acuity immediately smoothly eye movement vision compromise . Glare problem well contact lens center . Fluctuating vision result lens movement eye could especially problematic frustrating patient astigmatism . Furthermore , experience moment blur vision matter brief potentially hazardous driving . The 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST ASTIGMATISM contact lenses unique blink-activated stabilization system prevent rotation lens eye , may significant visual advantage driver astigmatism . These lens provide continuous correct acuity compare non-ballasted contact lens , thus potentially safe driving . Contact comparison consist 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST ( spherical control ) versus 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST ASTIGMATISM ( daily disposable astigmatism alternative ) . The study investigate potential advantage contact lenses specifically design correct astigmatism , compare similar correction spherical contact , adult license driver astigmatism , employ double-blind ( subject research assistant blind hypothesis ) , randomize , cross-over design ( spherical , vs. astigmatism contact ) . This multi-stage study comprise follow : Preliminary study determine likelihood detect significant difference standard spherical astigmatism contact full Randomize Clinical Trial ( n=12 ; data power analysis )</detailed_description>
