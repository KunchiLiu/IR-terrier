	<brief_title>Influence Sedentary Time Skeletal Muscle Protein Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcopenia , loss muscle mass age , think accelerate inactive , sedentary lifestyle . Increased sedentary time consistently associate low muscle mass compromise metabolic health . However , currently lack direct evidence support association . Therefore , study investigate whether increase sedentary time ( reduced step count exercise cessation ) directly influence long-term measure muscle protein synthesis metabolic health young , active adult . Following 7 day period normal habitual physical activity , participant undertake 7 day period step reduction exercise cessation . It hypothesise 7 day increase sedentary time result reduction long-term rate muscle protein synthesis worsen metabolic health .</detailed_description>
