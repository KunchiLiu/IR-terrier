	<brief_summary>Behaviors tobacco use , unhealthy diet , sedentary behavior far-reaching health implication . These modifiable behavior account substantial proportion death cancer , cardiovascular disease diabetes , take significant economic toll . Yet , many unhealthy behavior resistant change , despite widespread knowledge risk . Although theory behavior change advance explain persistence behavior , consider neurobehavioral underpinnings . These approach also fail address fundamental aspect behavior change - individual 's ability exert sufficient self-control overcome temptation immediate gratification and/or maintain attention long-term goal . With advance neuroimaging field , investigator learn self-control decision behavior execute brain . This work point central role neural activity dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) self-control process contribute healthy choice . Further , emerge evidence show activity prefrontal cortex cognitive control circuit modulate use noninvasive safe intervention : direct current transcranial stimulation ( tDCS ) . The investigator pilot study , IRB study # 820231 , demonstrate single session 1mA tDCS increase ability resist smoking validate smoking lapse paradigm . The current study use between-subject design investigate dose/response relationship tDCS ( administered 1mA , 2mA , sham stimulation three session ) ability resist smoking .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>tDCS Effects Resisting Smoking : Dose Ranging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial use between-subject single blind design participant randomize one three tDCS dosage group ( 1mA , 2mA sham ) receive three 20 minute session dosage course 1 week complete 7 day quit attempt . Eligible participant complete Intake Visit ( week -1 ) final eligibility determination , complete baseline measure ( eligible ) . Participants randomly assign one three dosage group ( 1mA , 2mA sham ) attend three identical tDCS resist-smoking session ( study day 1 , 3 , &amp; 5 ) receive 20 minute assign tDCS dosage complete cognitive task resist smoke paradigm . During resist smoking session , participant receive session assign dosage tDCS 20 minute expose vivo smoking cue ( cigarette pack , cigarette , ashtray ) . Participants informed dosage condition . During tDCS session , participant opportunity smoke approve smoking lab . The investigator measure time first cigarette subsequent ad libitum smoke resist smoking paradigm . Following Session 3 participant receive 20 minute coaching session train smoke cessation counselor help prepare 7-day quit attempt . During 7-day quit attempt participant ask attend 4 monitoring visit ( study day 6 , 8 , 10 &amp; 12 ) confirm smoking status .</detailed_description>
