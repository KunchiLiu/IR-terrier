	<brief_summary>Breast cancer optimal `` model disease '' study personalized medicine . Breast cancer first malignancy predictive factor forecast response therapy identify nearly 50 year ago ; expression estrogen receptor ( ER ) . Furthermore , breast cancer far malignancy prognostic predictive factor extensively study . Primary medical treatment ( pre-surgical medical therapy ) offer unique set explore predictive factor due fact primary breast cancer easily accessible repeat tissue sample evaluation therapy response clinically radiologically . For many year , investigator study predictive factor primary medical treatment breast cancer . In present project , investigator implement new trial concept current knowledge previous trial respect predictive marker ( hormone receptor , HER2 ; TP53 , CHEK2 RB1 ) , combine massive parallel sequencing ( MPS ) . Thereby , investigator aim design `` next-generation '' primary medical treatment 1 ) therapy regimens individualize base limited number know predictive factor , 2 ) MPS use explore additional predictive factor co-regulators order fully identify mechanisms drug sensitivity / resistance across individual tumour pave way personalize breast cancer therapy future . As new era `` genomic medicine '' , current trial concept allow individual tumour characterize unique gene mutation / epigenetic modification profile upfront , allocate patient optimal personalized medicine compare `` classical '' drug test phase II/III trial .</brief_summary>
