	<detailed_description>Dental plaque soft deposit form biofilm adhere tooth surface hard surface inside oral cavity , include removable fixed restoration . The dental plaque compose 500 bacterial specie . The colonization bacteria follow special pattern start adhesion initial bacterial colonizer salivary pellicle cover tooth enamel hard surface oral cavity follow secondary colonization follower bacteria inter-bacterial adhesion lead dental plaque maturation . Periodontal health consider state balance bacterial mass present host oral cavity cause damage either bacteria host periodontal tissue . Any disruption balance result alteration host periodontal biofilm bacteria lead ultimately destruction periodontium . Accumulation dental plaque may lead several harmful effect tooth tooth support periodontal tissue contributes development caries periodontal disease . Therefore , effective dental plaque control essential maintain good oral hygiene . Mechanical plaque control , use toothbrush interdental aid , mostly adopt method . Unfortunately , time consume process need high manual dexterity . Moreover , epidemiological study reveal high prevalence gingivitis among toothbrush user . Hence , chemical plaque control may use assist dental plaque control . The anti-plaque agent agent interfere one different phase dental plaque development : interferes adhesion oral bacteria oral surface prevent biofilm formation ; interfere co-aggregation mechanism thereby prevent future growth micro-colonies ; remove disrupts exist dental plaque . To date , chlorhexidine ( CHX ) mouthwash standard solution use chemical plaque control , find several side effect include tooth restoration stain , unpleasant test , slough oral mucosa enhancement supra-gingival calculus formation . The widely available traditional natural medicinal plant utilized stable , safe biologically active plant-derived galenicals alternative synthetic drug . Among plant , Salvadora persica L. ( Sp ) root stick green tea ( Gt ) , leafs Camellia sinensis . Kuntze , aqueous extract report anti-microbial activity many oral bacteria . In vitro study , find combination ( Co. ) 0.25mg Gt aqueous extract 7.82mg Sp aqueous extract 1ml exhibit significant synergistic anti-bacterial anti-adherence efficacy primary plaque colonizer . The dental plaque classify two category , supra-gingival plaque sub-gingival plaque , relation gingival margin . The supra-gingival dental plaque may readily visualize teeth 24 48 hour oral hygiene measure appear white , grayish , yellow color globular appearance . Supra-gingival plaque accumulation tooth surface quantify different plaque index system . In study , clinical parameter record plaque quantity modify Quigely Hein Plaque Index . In index , score 0 5 assign facial lingual ( palatal ) surface teeth except third molar .</detailed_description>
