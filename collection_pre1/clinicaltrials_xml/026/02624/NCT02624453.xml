	<brief_title>Pre-Antiretroviral Therapy ( ART ) Cryptococcal Antigen Screening AIDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryptococcal meningitis ( CM ) lead cause death AIDS patient much develop world , responsible 500,000 deaths year sub-Saharan Africa alone . Introduction antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) reduce number case cryptococcal meningitis develop world . Unfortunately , many low resource setting , patient continue present late ART treatment program advance immunosuppression , many die HIV-related illness week prior , month follow , initiation ART . Cryptococcal meningitis cause many death , also heavy burden healthcare facility . Treatment disease remain inadequate , acute mortality 20 50 % , even best current treatment . Many case cryptococcal meningitis may preventable . Recent research show routine screen sub-clinical infection , use simple test ( cryptococcal antigen CRAG ) patient present ART programme , identify patient risk develop cryptococcal meningitis . Once identify , patient could give safe oral `` pre-emptive '' treatment prevent develop severe form disease . This strategy many advantage alternative preventative measure , call generalised primary prophylaxis , involve give profoundly immune depressed HIV-infected patient preventative treatment . Using primary prophylaxis strategy , large number patient give medication , many n't need , problem cost development drug resistance drug interaction . In targeted strategy , patient benefit treatment give medication . The investigator propose study feasibility effectiveness CRAG screening target pre-emptive treatment patient enter ART treatment programme Yaoundé , Cameroon use newly approve , easy use , lateral flow format dipstick test ( LFA ) . In planned study , 400 patient screen use CRAG test prior start ART . Patients positive cryptococcal antigen consent lumbar puncture ( LP ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) analysis , , find cryptococcal meningitis , eligible , randomise include complementary clinical trial `` Advancing Cryptococcal Treatment Africa '' ( ACTA ) [ ISRCTN45035509 , ANRS12275 ] treat accord study protocol . Positive cryptococcal antigen patient evidence neurological disease follow lumbar puncture , decline diagnostic LP receive taper course fluconazole . Cryptococcal antigen negative patient receive additional antifungal therapy . All CRAG screen patient start standard ART 2 4 week screen follow 1 year , depend antigen status , determine whether patient go develop clinical cryptococcal meningitis . General objective - To implement evaluate systematic cryptococcal antigen screen strategy reduce cryptococcal meningoencephalitis morbidity mortality among HIV-infected patient initiate antiretroviral therapy le 100 CD4 cell count Day Hospital Yaoundé Central Hospital Cameroon Specific objectives - To determine prevalence cryptococcal antigenaemia and/or antigenuria among HIV-infected patient present less 100 CD4 cell count - To determine prevalence laboratory confirm cryptococcal meningoencephalitis among patient find CRAG positive - To determine incidence newly diagnose , relapse , laboratory confirm cryptococcal meningitis first year start ART screen patient . - To determine mortality within first year ART among patient screen CRAG Study design number patient A prospective cohort study 400 ART naive patient present entry ART programme le 100 CD4 cell count/ml screen CRAG use LFA serum urine follow one year . Study intervention Main intervention study cryptococcal antigen ( CRAG ) screening . All eligible patient screen baseline use LFA , point care ( POC ) dipstick test , serum and/or plasma , urine . Aliquots save later titering CRAG positive sample . All subsequent treatment patient management accord local guideline and/or internationally accept best practice standard . Subsequent management Cryptococcal antigen negative participant : All CRAG negative participant commence ART counsel pre-ART work-up complete within estimate time 2 week accordance current Cameroon National AIDS control programme guideline . There intervention . The participant see outpatient clinic 2nd 4th week follow screening , routinely accord day hospital roster , finally , every three month one year date screening . Cryptococcal antigen positive participant : All CRAG positive participant careful symptom screen ( headache/altered mental status ) , ask consent LP CSF analysis : If cryptococcal meningitis diagnose Indian ink and/or culture , patient eligible , patient may include clinical trial `` Advancing Cryptococcal Treatment Africa '' ( ACTA ) treat accord ACTA protocol . If patient ineligible , decline include ACTA trial , treat short course amphotericin B ( one week ) combine oral fluconazole 800mg/day two week , 8 week fluconazole 40mg/day 200mg/day thereafter . If LP negative cryptococcal meningitis ( LP refuse ) , patient receive Fluconazole 800 mg/day 2 week 400 mg/day 8 week 200 mg/day ( base current best practice ) . Patients commence ART ( efavirenz base ) 2-4 week start antifungal therapy , accordance current Cameroon National AIDS control programme guideline . Follow-up one year . Patients see outpatient clinic every two week first ten week , three month interval . During outpatient visit , case opportunistic infection occurrence , manage accord local current practice Day Hospital . Women child-bearing age propose contraception ( preferably barrier method ) period follow .</detailed_description>
