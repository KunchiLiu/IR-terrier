To determine feasibility use FAZA-PET image primary tumor hypoxia patient rectal cancer prior treatment chemoradiotherapy Secondary Objectives 2 . To optimize FAZA PET/MRI image protocol use patient rectal cancer . 3 . To determine whether correlation FAZA-PET , blood oxygen level-dependent MRI Pimonidazole stain primary rectal tumor CRT . 4 . To correlate hypoxia define FAZA PET uptake blood oxygen level-dependent MRI rectal cancer ( pathologic ) response neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Study design : Single arm feasibility pilot study Study scheme : ( see ) Details Tumor Microscopy Pimonidazole Image analysis : The initial assessment pimonidazole-detected hypoxia tumor section surgical specimen immunohistochemical allows qualitative quantitative assessment pimonidazole stain context histopathological morphology . To account heterogeneity pimonidazole staining , analysis perform multiple surgical section patient tumor ( previously publish investigator group ) . All staining , handle process tissue specimens do pathology department . STUDY SCHEMA : Target Population : - Age ≥ 18 year - Histological diagnosis rectal cancer - Intent treat neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy surgery - Negative pregnancy test ( female child bear age ) 1 . Informed Consent 2 . FAZA-PET/MRI - Void bladder - FAZA injection - Dynamic PET acquisition MRI Dixon sequence attenuation correction ( 60 min ; optional ) - 60 minute uptake time ( rest ) - Void bladder - Static PET/MRI pelvis ( approximately 45 min ) 3 . Standard treatment ( neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy 4 . Oral Pimonidazole day prior surgery 5 . Surgery</detailed_description>
