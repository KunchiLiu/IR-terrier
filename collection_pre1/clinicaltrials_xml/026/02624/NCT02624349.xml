	<brief_summary>The human papilloma virus ( HPV ) know important cause cervical anal cancer . Studies patient receive solid organ transplant ( liver kidney transplant ) suggest risk HPV-related cancer may high population . The HPV vaccine , Gardasil® , approve use male females Health Canada . In study healthy subject vaccine nearly 100 % effective preventing infection HPV serotypes vaccine . These serotypes , represent different viral strain , know cause 70 % cervical cancer 90 % genital wart . The vaccine also show safe well tolerate healthy subject . Transplant patient high risk HPV related complication cancer . As result transplant expert recommend vaccine use patient ; however study look response vaccination safety vaccine solid organ transplant recipient . Our objective study immune response side effect Gardasil® child receive kidney liver transplant . We study compare immune response vaccine healthy adolescent female compare female liver kidney transplant recipient . We recruit female age 12-19 , province Ontario fund vaccine group . We evaluate transplant subject side effect receive vaccine . Our hypothesis transplant recipient low immunogenicity healthy control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Hypothesis The Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine , Gardasil® , likely provide protection solid organ transplant patient vaccinate strain low immunogenicity rate compare healthy control . We expect high level immune suppression influence immunogenic response . 2 . Objective Primary : To evaluate immunogenicity recombinant HPV vaccine , Gardasil® , pediatric solid organ transplant recipient compare control , well evaluate clinical risk factor associate low response transplant recipient . Immunogenicity assess geometric mean titre ( GMT ) well seroconversion . Secondary : To evaluate safety Gardasil® transplant recipient . 3 . Background 3.1 Disease HPV know predispose cervical , anal , variety head neck cancer healthy adult immunocompromised , include receive solid organ transplant . An estimated 3 million woman Canada infect HPV . Peak incidence occurs within 5-10 year first sexual experience adolescent female represent large cohort affect HPV . 3.2 Vaccine In 2006 Food Drug Administration approve quadravalent recombinant HPV vaccine , Gardasil® , target strain 16 18 well 6 11 , responsible 70 % cervical cancer case 90 % genital wart , respectively . Health Canada recently approve Gardasil® use female ' age 9-45 year males 9-26 year . Gardasil® show numerous clinical trial effective management HPV prevent vaccine sub-type related infection precancerous lesion . Gardasil® regard generally safe well tolerate base reported adverse event government database United States , well analyse independent research . The bivalent HPV vaccine , Cervarix® , also appear safe effective prevent cervical cancer , however data less robust would protection genital wart strain . Long term benefit HPV vaccination unknown , however model predict significant mortality benefit prevent case cervical cancer7 overall cost-effectiveness ; particularly vaccine administer girl age twelve . 3.3 HPV Transplant Patients Due prominent role cell-mediated immunity HPV , transplant recipient felt increase risk infection lead extensive frequent wart , increase incidence skin anogenital malignancy . Skin cancer common malignancy affect patient post transplantation . Anogenital cancer incidence estimate 30-100 time great transplant patient compare general population . HPV preventable cause large number malignancy , suggest vaccine could potentially thwart morbidity mortality experience transplant recipient . Furthermore , study suggest organ transplant patient likely infected HPV well develop secondary neoplasia . For reason vaccinate population HPV potential significant long-term benefit . 4 . Methods 4.1 Design We propose prospective observational study evaluate serological response vaccine cover HPV serotypes ; 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 . This study take advantage routine , provincially fund population base vaccination program , patient receive vaccine study healthy adolescent receive school grade 7 8 . Study subject identify use liver kidney transplant clinical database control subject identify Hospital Sick Children adolescent medicine clinic . A letter introduction send family . Consent obtain transplant nurse physician know patient . Transplant subject undergo baseline post-immunization serology evaluate GMT well document seroconversion response vaccine . Gardasil® fund province Ontario . Controls receive vaccine adolescent clinic , school , Toronto Public Health clinic community per recommend schedule . At recruitment attempt make draw baseline serology status , vaccinate , collect post-immunization serology document seroconversion . However , facilitate recruitment control document receipt three dos vaccine child recruit post-vaccination serology compare GMTs . Control vaccines also fund province Ontario administer accordance Health Canada standard . 4.2 Investigational Agent 4.2.1 Vaccine storage characteristic Gardasil® ( Merck Canada Inc ) , Quadravalent Human papillomavirus ( Types 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 ) Recombinant Vaccine , select study efficacy safety data healthy subject , publically fund province Ontario , provide protection 4 HPV serotypes . Gardasil® store refrigerate 2-8 degree Celsius , frozen remain protected light . The total time outside refrigerator exceed 72 hour . Vaccines store compliant division 5 Canadian regulation . 4.2.2 Administration vaccine Gardasil® vaccine recommend administer intramuscularly deltoid thigh dose 0.5ml 0 , 2 , 6 month . While every effort make keep aforementioned schedule , study support flexibility schedule . The 2nd dose administer least 1 month 1st , 9 month . The 3rd dose administer 3 month follow second dose , 1 year follow first dose . All 3 dos must administer within 1 year period include analysis . Subjects monitor 15 min post-vaccination adverse effect . 4.3 Sample Size The study power base GMT immunogenicity . Based primary outcome , wish compare serum titre transplant patient compare control . The sample size calculation base 90 % power 95 % confidence assumption HPV vaccination result protective titre 80 % transplant patient compare 100 % control . A sample size approximately 75 transplant recipient 75 control therefore prefer detect significant difference , however recruitment least 50 participant group acceptable . Recruitment take place 6 month period , result total study duration approximately 12 month , maximum 18 month account possible delay vaccine administration 1 year end recruitment . 4.4 . Analysis In primary analysis immunogenicity , GMTs summarize transplant recipient compare control . The proportion subject achieve protective GMTs , define previously , compare use Chi-square Fishers ' exact test appropriate . Means compare use Students t-test non-parametric procedure use compare median , appropriate . Subjects control evaluated head-to-head comparison . For control serology interpret relative time last dose give . The investigator use multivariate analytic procedure examine effect several independent variable immunogenicity dependent variable . These independent variable one could potentially associate difference immune responsiveness ( e.g. , interval transplantation vaccine administration ) . Other variable include follow : age ; type organ transplant ; presence absence graft rejection ; type immune suppression ( e.g. , use anti-T lymphocyte therapy ) ; immune globulin therapy ; cytomegalovirus infection disease ; Epstein-Barr virus infection disease ; presence bacterial opportunistic infection , concurrent disease , steroid dos , total lymphocyte count . The secondary analysis capture describe adverse effect among transplant recipient telephone call 48 hour 7 day utilize Public Health Ontario adverse event report form 4.5 Data Safety Monitoring Board Research Ethics The study do approval institution 's Research Ethics Board . In addition , although reason anticipate problem vaccine transplant patient , establish Data Safety Monitoring Board review emerge data relate major catastrophic event temporally associate vaccine ( even absence obvious causality ) . 4.5.1 Early Termination Withdrawal Subjects and/or parents/legal guardian right withdraw study time reason . The investigator also right withdraw subject study best interest subject . Subject withdrawal criterion follow : - Withdrawal informed consent ( subject 's decision withdraw reason ) - Serious adverse event , opinion investigator , indicate continued participation study best interest subject - Any clinical adverse event inter-current illness , opinion investigator , indicate continued participation study best interest subject ( ex . Participants develop symptom hypersensitivity receive first second dose Gardasil® withdrawn study receive dos Gardasil® ) - Pregnancy - Subject non-adherence vaccine administration schedule define In event subject withdrawn due Adverse Event , record subject continue follow event resolve stabilize , possible . 4.5.2 Adverse Events All adverse event report Hospital Sick Children Research Ethics Board accord Hospital Sick Children 's adverse event reporting requirement . All serious , unexpected adverse drug reaction study medication report Health Canada within 15 calendar day death life-threatening event , within 7 calendar day . In latter case , follow-up report must file within 8 additional calendar day . Adverse reaction manage accord Hospital Sick Children 's standard clinical management practice .</detailed_description>
