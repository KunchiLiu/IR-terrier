	<brief_summary>Individuals upper-limb amputation usually intact nerve within residual limb , study demonstrate electrical stimulation nerve produce sensation appear emanate amputate limb . In study , investigator examine sensation produce electrical stimulation nerve location exit spinal cord . Stimulation spinal cord commonly use treat intractable back limb pain , procedure include test phase electrodes temporarily place skin near spinal cord remove end testing . Similarly , study , electrode place near spinal cord upper back neck , stimulation apply course multiple testing session , last less 30 day . The electrode remove last day test . During test session , electrical stimulation apply electrodes series test perform determine type sensation produce stimulation . In addition produce meaningful sensation electrical stimulation , study also test effect stimulation phantom limb sensation phantom limb pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose research study characterize type sensation produce stimulate spinal nerve upper-limb amputee , well effect stimulation phantom limb pain . The study involve medical procedure temporarily place one three stimulation electrode space near spinal cord . This medical procedure perform local anesthesia , take approximately one two hour . Afterwards , electrode connect external stimulator series experiment perform characterize type sensation generate electrical stimulation spinal cord spinal nerve , well measure effect stimulation phantom limb sensation phantom limb pain . Over course le 30 day , 20 experimental session . At end final experimental session , stimulation electrode remove gently pull . The investigator invite participant consider participate research upper-limb amputation . Participants must age 18 70 least one year post-amputation . Participants must willing travel University Pittsburgh least twice per week 30 day . Participants serious disease disorder affect ability participate study . Women pregnant plan become pregnant study include . The investigator ask female child-bearing potential undergo urine pregnancy test prior procedure ( MRI , x-ray , fluoroscopy ) may disrupt healthy development unborn child . If participant currently take medication thin blood , participant eligible study . Participants meet criterion eligible , review participant upon consent . The investigator screen 15 people expect 10 individual complete study .</detailed_description>
