	<brief_summary>A subset patient NAFLD extensively study infected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Currently , FDA approve treatment NAFLD NASH . Additionally , significant clinical trial HIV patient NAFLD approve treatment option . We plan conduct randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial examine efficacy 600 mg Aramchol daily ( include 200 mg tablet 400 mg tablet ) versus identical placebo give 12 week improve HIV-associated hepatic steatosis measure validated accurate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -based technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan conduct randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial examine efficacy Aramchol 600 mg/day orally versus identical placebo give 12 week improve HIV-associated hepatic steatosis measure validated accurate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -based technique . In study , propose randomize 50 patient HIV-associated NAFLD either Aramchol placebo 12 week . We plan enroll total 55 patient , expect drop out prior randomization . After initial evaluation insulin sensitivity , liver fat measurement MRI , total body fat content DEXA , patient randomize receive either Aramchol 600 mg/day placebo orally 12 week . Patients monitor regular interval symptoms liver disease , side effect medication , serum biochemical metabolic index . Patients also assess continued HIV viral load suppression continue tolerance antiretroviral therapy . At end 12 week , patient repeat medical evaluation , liver fat measurement , total body fat content measurement . Pre post treatment liver fat MRI , ALT/AST , HbA1c , CRP , insulin sensitivity , DEXA whole body fat compare . The primary end point successful therapy improvement liver fat MRI . Secondary end point improvement total body fat , insulin sensitivity liver biochemistry .</detailed_description>

An MRIdetermined fat fraction classification threshold ( ≥5 % ) use confirm subject . MR examination include four research sequence ( three image sequence one singlevoxel spectroscopy sequence ) develop refine Dr. Sirlin , allow measurement liver fat fraction newer candidate MR biomarkers future NAFLD study . MR examination last 2030 minute perform without contrast agent . Subjects scan 1.5T . To assess sequence repeatability , two sequence per subject , block randomize , run three time . For MR elastography , MR image do include place vibrate paddle abdomen image obtain . A comprehensive screening questionnaire utilized prior subject MRI .
