At time inclusion , 2 month 6 month , patient ' physical capacity measure use Incremental Shuttle Walk test . Furthermore patient ' complete questionnaire quality life ( EQ-5D Pulmonary Embolism Quality Life Questionnaire ) , self-reported sick leave use psychoactive drug . All follow-up measurement visit take place hospital patient discharge . Expected outcome perspective : The investigator expect home-based exercise programme improve overall treatment outcome patient intervention group . The study furthermore contribute significantly limited knowledge optimal rehabilitation group patient , may thereby form basis future recommendation field .</detailed_description>
