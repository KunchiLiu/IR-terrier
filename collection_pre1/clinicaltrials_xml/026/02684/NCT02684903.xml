	<brief_summary>This randomize , control trial Parent-Child Interaction Therapy ( PCIT ) design test effect PCIT self-regulation behavior child maltreating ( CM ) parent elementary-school child . Two hundred-fifty ( 250 ) maltreating mother child ( age 5-8 year ) draw Child Protective Services randomize PCIT intervention control condition ( service usual ) . Key contextual risk factor assess , include cumulative risk , parent mental health , parent substance use . A multirater , multimethod approach assessment include neural ( EEG/ERP ) , physiological ( ECG ) , behavioral , self-report measure self-regulation CM mother child , well standard measure parent skill child 's behavior outcome . Families follow 6 month self-regulation , parenting , child behavioral outcome , 1 year CM recidivism . Findings propose study expect significant implication optimize CM parent intervention ( ) determine sensitivity CM parent child neurobehavioral self-regulation system intervention , ( b ) identify individual difference self-regulation mediate moderate response intervention long-term maintenance gain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Child maltreatment ( CM ) constitute serious public health problem United States know compromise child 's develop self-regulation skill amplify risk substance use regulatory disorder . Parents implicate 80 % CM case involve physical abuse neglect thus represent critical target intervention . Research physiological response CM parent parent ( e.g. , Skowron et al. , 2013 ) suggest parent intervention may less effective population fail affect neurobehavioral marker dysregulation drive harsh , aversive parenting . Parent-Child Interaction Therapy ( PCIT ) , intensive , 20-session parenting intervention , show improve quality CM parenting , improve positive parent child behavior , produce decline CM recidivism ( Chaffin et al. , 2004 ) though mechanisms underlying effect little understood . This project address gap CM intervention literature ( ) use experimental intervention design test theoretical model change underlie PCIT 's effect , ( b ) include battery neurobehavioral measure self-regulation , ( c ) use observational measure parent RCT evidence-based intervention strengthen parent self-regulation , reduce CM , support improvement child regulation behavior . In sample N = 250 mother school-age child document case physical abuse and/or neglect , investigator test follow aim : Aim 1 : Test main effect PCIT CM-specific outcome , include reduction harsh , aversive parenting CM recidivism promotion child 's behavioral adjustment . It hypothesize intervention family show significantly great behavior improvement ( i.e. , decrease negative parenting , increase positive parenting , decrease child internalizing/externalizing problem ) posttest low CM recidivism 6-month follow-up , compare family receive service usual ( SAU ) . Specific Aim 2 : Determine impact PCIT neural , physiological , emotional , behavioral index CM parent ' self-regulation . First , investigator test hypothesis PCIT exert direct effect improve CM parent ' neurobehavioral capacity self-regulation context parenting . Second , investigator investigate measure self-regulation parent mediate PCIT intervention effect reduction CM improvement parent . Third , investigator explore whether parent ' preintervention self-regulation level moderate intervention effect outcomes . The moderating roles CM subtype ( i.e. , physical abuse vs. neglect ) , severity , key sociocontextual factor outcomes interest also consider . The investigator use multirater , multimethod assessment include standard laboratory measure self-regulation ( e.g. , EEG/ERP , ECG , behavioral , parent report ) observational cod parent interaction examine intervention-related change . Specific Aim 3 : Investigate impact PCIT neurobehavioral index CM child 's self-regulation . CM exert detrimental effect child 's develop capacity regulate attention , emotion , physiology , behavior . Deficits domains confer heighten risk psychopathology , early-onset conduct problem , later substance abuse . The investigator hypothesize PCIT , though direct primarily toward parent , effect improvement neurobiological indicator CM child 's self-regulation post-treatment , relative control group . Next , investigator test extent child outcomes mediate intervention effect parent . It hypothesize child regulatory deficit behavior problem attenuate PCIT-based reduction aversive parent result intervention .</detailed_description>
