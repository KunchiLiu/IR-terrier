	<brief_title>Metformin Minimization Geographic Atrophy Progression Patients With AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , single-blind , randomize , evaluation safety efficacy metformin use decrease geographic atrophy ( GA ) progression non-diabetic patient dry Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) . Approximately 100 study subject throughout four separate study site randomize 1:1 ratio treatment group observation group . The treatment group assign study intervention ( oral Metformin ) 18 month observation group receive intervention 18 month , instead continue standard care ophthalmic exam close monitor disease . Throughout 18 month study period , progression subject ' GA measure via ocular image take standard care follow-up examination , include fundus autofluorescence imaging , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , fundus photography .</detailed_description>
