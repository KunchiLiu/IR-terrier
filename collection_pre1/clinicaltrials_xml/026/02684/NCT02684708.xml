	<detailed_description>EuroNet-PHL-C2 comprehensive treatment strategy first line classical Hodgkin Lymphoma ( cHL ) patient 18 year ( 25 year UK , Italy France ) . The overall strategy risk stratify ( define chemotherapy ) response adapt ( define radiotherapy ) tailor amount treatment individual patient decrease long term complication . - Radiotherapy indication restrict . Patients negative PET scan two cycle OEPA chemotherapy ( Early Response Assessment - ERA ) receive radiotherapy . The threshold negative PET scan ERA shift previously use Deauville 1 2 = negative ( C1 trial ) Deauville 1 , 2 3 = negative , thereby increase number negative patient without indication RT . - Chemotherapy Randomisation All intermediate ( TL-2 ) advance stage ( TL-3 ) patient randomise respectively 2 4 standard COPDAC-28 intensify DECOPDAC-21 consolidation chemotherapy cycle . To avoid delayed consolidation , randomisation perform ERA soon TL-assignment confirm central review . Therefore two randomise sub-studies arise base ERA PET response : Patients adequate response ERA receive radiotherapy - randomise controlled chemotherapy comparison show intensify DECOPDAC-21 consolidation chemotherapy improve EFS compare standard COPDAC-28 Patients inadequate response ERA - randomise controlled chemotherapy-radiotherapy comparison - show DECOPDAC-21 combine radiotherapy restrict site remain FDG-PET positive end chemotherapy ( Late response assessment - LRA ) comparable EFS compare COPDAC-28 plus standard involved node radiotherapy C1 trial . - Risk stratification refine Former treatment group ( TG ) EuroNet-PHL-C1 trial reassign treatment level ( TL ) shift early stage patient ( former TG-1 ) risk factor TL-2 . - Semi-quantitative 'qPET ' Results semi-quantitative qPET formally integrated response assessment .</detailed_description>
