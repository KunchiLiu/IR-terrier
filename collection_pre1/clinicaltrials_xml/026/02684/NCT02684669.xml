	<brief_summary>In several rodent study , demonstrate high dos opioid antagonist ( i.e. , naloxone 3-10 mg/kg ) administer week recovery inflammatory injury may lead reinstatement hyperalgesia pain behavior . This latent sensitization recently demonstrate also take place human . The present study examines possible foresee individual demonstrate large degree latent sensitization upon challenge injury , others . Using enriched design high sensitizer ( e.g. , upper quartile individual develop large area secondary hyperalgesia follow mild burn injury ) compare low sensitizer ( low quartile ) , regard propensity develop latent sensitization</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect High-dose Target-controlled Naloxone Infusion Pain Hyperalgesia During Burn Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Naloxone mu-opioid-receptor ( MOR ) antagonist drug , dose-dependently exhibit hypo-algesic hyper-algesic property . Naloxone ( MOR-antagonists ) use research study role endogenous opioids central process pain . It hypothesize endogenous opioid modulation pain impair altered chronic pain condition . In previous study use electrical pain model human patient , naloxone ( 21 microg/kg ) increase establish area secondary hyperalgesia . Further , administration naloxone naltrexone animal follow resolution inflammatory condition , demonstrate reinstatement hypersensitivity noxious stimulus , indicate latent sensitization . It thus speculate endogenous opioids may play important role transition acute chronic pain human . Recently , however , investigator unable show reinstatement secondary hyperalgesia resolution burn injury administrate naloxone low dose ( 21 microg/kg ) . Based find investigator hypothesize , negative result may due low dose naloxone insufficient tissue injury generate latent sensitization . The systemic dos opioid antagonist use animal study demonstrate latent sensitization 0.3 3.0 mg/kg naltrexone 3-10 mg/kg naloxone . Further , high dos 1-2 mg/kg naloxone use clinical experimental psychiatric , endocrinological , neurological nutritional study patient healthy individual . In one pain related study , 6 mg/kg naloxone give healthy patient intramuscularly . Only mild moderate , transitory side-effects record study . The investigator , therefore , initiated second translational study hypothesize high dose naloxone ( 2 mg/kg ) would reinstate secondary hyperalgesia human patient follow resolution mild burn injury thus show latent sensitization human . The investigator demonstrate 4 12 patient naloxone administer 7 day mild burn injury associate reinstatement secondary hyperalgesia . The present study examines possible foresee individual demonstrate large degree latent sensitization upon challenge injury , others . Using enriched design high sensitizer ( e.g. , upper quartile individual develop large area secondary hyperalgesia follow mild burn injury ) compare low sensitizer ( low quartile ) , regard propensity develop latent sensitization .</detailed_description>
