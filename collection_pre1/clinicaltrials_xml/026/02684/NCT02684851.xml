	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine patient undergo acetabular ORIF ( open reduction internal fixation ) receive tranexamic acid reduce risk allogenic blood transfusion , perioperative blood loss , wound complication high risk thromboembolic event compare patient receive placebo . Investigators want determine cost-effectiveness relate allogenic blood transfusion blood loss management strategy acetabular open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) . Orthopaedic surgery carry significant risk blood loss . Current management perioperative blood loss use allogenic blood transfusion . Allogenic blood transfusion carry risk HIV Hepatitis C well multiple adverse reaction . There significant effort reduce use allogenic blood transfusion orthopaedic surgery . Tranexamic acid , anti-fibrinolytic agent , use management blood surgery . In order determine impact tranexamic acid reduce blood loss among patient undergo acetabular ORIF , investigator conduct prospective randomize study . Patients undergo acetabular surgery screen study . Patients randomize placebo tranexamic acid administer surgery . The following data collect : patient characteristic , surgery information , blood loss , blood transfusion , wound complication within 30 day surgery , cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Tranexamic Acid Reduce Blood Loss Acetabular Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator plan prospectively determine effect tranexamic acid blood loss outcome surgery acetabulum . Patients randomize two group . In study , investigator plan administer 10mg/kg dose within 30 minute surgery follow 10mg/kg infusion 4hr period treatment group ( patient weight 100kg , weight 100kg use dose calculation ) . The control group receive equal volume rate normal saline . Research Questions : 1 . Do patient undergo acetabular ORIF receive tranexamic acid reduce risk allogenic blood transfusion compare patient receive placebo ? 2 . Do patient undergo acetabular ORIF receive tranexamic acid reduce peri-operative blood loss compare patient receive placebo ? 3 . Do patient undergo acetabular ORIF receive tranexamic acid high risk thromboembolic event patient receive placebo ? 4 . Do patient undergo acetabular ORIF receive tranexamic acid reduce risk wound complication ( prolong wound drainage , return OR within 30 day , infection ) ? 5 . Is use tranexamic acid cost effective relative use allogenic blood transfusion blood loss management strategy acetabular ORIF ?</detailed_description>
