	<brief_summary>For 15 year , traditional fasting regimen prior schedule surgery call question , yet prolong preoperative fasting remain common practice . While prolonged fasting aim reduce risk pulmonary aspiration , prolong fast uncomfortable , inconsistent effect gastric volume acidity may lead dehydration without clear reduction incidence aspiration . Fasting decrease hepatic glycogen store , induces state insulin resistance impairs cardiovascular function . Yet , prolong preoperative fasting remain common . Preoperative oral carbohydrate ( CHO ) consumption improve insulin sensitivity decrease time return gut function without increase gastric volume acidity compare clear liquid fast . Previous work show oral CHO consumption improve patient well-being great degree placebo drink ( water flavor water ) fast control . Oral CHO also outperform similar volume intravenous glucose supplementation . These benefit reduce hospital stay variety surgical model much 20 % . Further , preoperative CHO supplementation improve postoperative patient hunger , thirst , anxiety , fatigue nausea . The purpose research study determine drink high carbohydrate beverage cesarean section surgery improve patient well-being , compare patient drink low carbohydrate beverage fast surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study hop determine either two different oral beverage ( high CHO concentration versus lower CHO concentration ) superior routine fasting term preoperative well-being among patient present scheduled cesarean section . Preoperative well-being determine composite visual analog scale score aim assess hunger , thirst , anxiety , fatigue nausea morning surgery . Women recruit one two outpatient obstetric clinic , University Florida ( UF ) Health Women 's Center - Medical Plaza UF Health Women 's Center . Women present schedule cesarean section provide opportunity participate . Then woman randomize one three group : oral carbohydrate beverage ( group CHO ) , re-hydration beverage equal volume ( group R ) fast control ( group F ) . All subject consent participation follow record : height , weight , age , indication cesarean section , surgeon , number prior cesarean section .</detailed_description>
