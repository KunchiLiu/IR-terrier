	<detailed_description>Background . Pulmonary hypertension Group 2 ( PH 2 ) associate left-sided heart disease relatively common , associated poor prognosis , unfortunately proven medical treatment beyond attempt correct leave sided heart disease . Many PH 2 patient evidence vasoconstriction increase sympathetic nervous system activity . Use agent procedure produce reversible chemical sympathectomy systematically test PH 2 . Methods . Two group eligible participation : Group 1 ( n=10 ) : Patients PH 2 previously document echocardiography ( echo ) , 6 minute walk test , biomarkers , right heart catheterization ( RHC ) receive reserpine , 0.05 mg per day two week , , 0.1 mg per day additional two week . After one month , patient reassess New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class drug side effect , echocardiography , 6 minute walk assessment , brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) . Group 2 patient ( n=10 ) clinically suspect PH 2 schedule undergo clinically indicate RHC . If RHC PH 2 confirm , assessment nitric oxide responsiveness , baseline hemodynamics re-established 10 minute , leave stellate ganglion block lidocaine perform , immediate hemodynamic responsiveness assess . Four hour post-procedure , side effect questionnaire obtain . Group 2 patient complete RHC begin reserpine treatment manner Group I patient . Hypothesis Impact . PH 2 common type pulmonary hypertension . The current diagnostic therapeutic strategy aim treat leave sided heart disease attempt normalize pulmonary artery pressure . The place selective pulmonary vasodilator undefined . The investigator 's approach address inhibition adverse pulmonary vasoconstriction mediate sympathetic nervous system PH 2 .</detailed_description>
