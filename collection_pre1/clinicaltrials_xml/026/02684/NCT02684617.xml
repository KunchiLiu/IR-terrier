	<brief_summary>This non-randomized , open-label study evaluate safety efficacy pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) use combination dinaciclib ( MK-7965 ) treatment relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( rrCLL ) , multiple myeloma ( rrMM ) , diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( rrDLBCL ) 138 participant multiple site . During initial Dose Evaluation phase ( first 2 cycle ) determine Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) , dose combination pembrolizumab 200 mg follow dinaciclib 7 mg/m^2 , pembrolizumab 200 mg follow dinaciclib 10 mg/m^2 , pembrolizumab 200 mg follow dinaciclib 14 mg/m^2 evaluate . Following safety review Dose Evaluation Phase , approximately 30 participant enrol rrCLL , rrMM , DLBCL cohorts Signal Detection phase . For disease type objective response rate ( ORR ) determine disease specific criterion .</brief_summary>
