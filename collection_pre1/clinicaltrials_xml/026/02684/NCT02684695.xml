	<detailed_description>This body research comprise number sub-studies , design evaluate use quantitative MRI JIA . Although patient receive treatment study , form part routine clinical care therefore study best regarded observational . 1 . Subjects recruitment Patients recruit clinical rheumatologist work specialist adolescent young adult inflammatory arthritis tertiary referral centre , person-to-person basis . Patients age 12-24 diagnosis JIA accord establish clinical criteria.8,9 Individuals enthesitis-related arthropathy form JIA ( extend oligorticular polyarthritis ( rheumatoid factor positive negative ) ) divide separate group ask MRI scan . Control subject recruit clinic , consist individual mechanical back pain ( non-inflammatory - thought arise vertebra , discs ligament ) normal inflammatory marker . Such patient still require MRI scan part routine care confirm mechanical cause back pain definitively rule inflammation cause , serve non-inflammatory control . All patient ask provide write consent time enrolment . Patients include patient new diagnosis JIA establish disease already treatment . For obvious ethical reason , patient divide different treatment group . 2 . Study Design Patients divide accord diagnostic group - group A consist patient ERA ( also control subsequently diagnose mechanical back pain ) , group B consist patient ERA , extend oligo- polyarthritis . As detailed , scan protocol different two group . JIA patient group scan enrolment repeat scan every 6-12 month , depend clinical need , five year total . Thereafter , scan perform defined requirement clinical care year 10 study . The control group group A scan . They ask provide write consent prior enrol . The image component study run five year total , approximately 200 patient recruited total . In group A , DWI FF measurement perform SIJs . These measurement correlate ( see statistic , ) conventional score inflammation DWI FF validate biomarkers inflammation SIJ ( see detail technique ) . In group B , whole body MRI scan perform view develop quantitative score inflammation whole body . This score validate correlation validate clinical measure disease activity physician global assessment disease activity , juvenile arthritis disease activity score ( JADAS ) , Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ - measure function ) biochemical ( blood ) marker inflammation ( see detail ) . This technique pilot approximately 10 patient JIA ( ERA , extend oligo polyarthritis ) course 1-3 month begin full-scale recruitment . 3 . Scan Protocol The scan protocol tailor accord diagnostic group . Group A ( ERA ) - T1-weighted axial coronal pelvis , sagittal spine - Post-contrast T1 axial coronal pelvis , sagittal spine - STIR , axial coronal pelvis - Diffusion-weighted image ( b value 0 , 50 , 100 , 300 600 ) pelvis - mDixon image ( phase image acquire used generate fat water image ; protocol design per Dr Alan Bainbridge ) Group B ( oligoarthritis polyarthritis ) patient undergo whole-body MRI include follow sequence : - mDixon - mDixon contrast - Diffusion weight image The protocol require technical development optimisation start study . This undertaken collaboration Dr Alan Bainbridge . 2-3 b value ( e.g . 50 , 100 , 300 ) use DWI sequence . Anatomical station include foot , knee , hips/pelvis spine ( TMJ pelvis ) ; shaft femur tibia omit . Image quality likely poor arm may image use dedicated sequence . STIR ( short tau inversion recovery ) method use fat suppression foot , knee hip . 4 . Group A ( ERA ) - Development Scoring Systems i. DWI DWI already use clinical scan ERA cohort . We aim validate use ADC measurement quantitative biomarker ERA cohort . Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) map generate vendor software use monoexponential fit . ADC map analyse use linear region-of-interest ( ROI ) technique , previously described.10 Two three ROIs drawn across joint image slice . Each ROI measure 14-16mm length , subsequently 'cut ' standard 14mm length use dedicate Matlab software . This procedure repeat central four axial slice ( measure 8mm thickness ) . A ROI drawn normal sacral bone use reference . Normalised ADC value ( nADC ) calculate ROI mean ADC divide mean reference ADC . In addition , image analyse use histographic analysis joint ADC value ( use 'area ' ROIs ) . Analysis include thresholding method measurement skew/kurtosis inflame compare normal joint . It hypothesise significant , positive correlation ADC conventional STIR score inflammation ( show pilot data ) .11 The study assess correlation various ADC score STIR score order determine correlate closely . ii . Fat fraction FF measurement novel approach quantify inflammation ; aim develop ultimately validate FF biomarker . Inflamed joint analyse use region-of-interest ( ROI ) analysis mDixon image , determine fat fraction ( FF ) inflame bone compare normal bone . Polygonal ROIs hand-drawn across large joint standardized fashion . The pixel value derive ROIs analyse use multiple method , include simple average histographic analysis . Again , thresholding method analysis skew/kurtosis explore method assess inflamed compare normal joint . It hypothesize fat fraction decrease inflame bone compare normal bone , due infiltration inflammatory cell increase extracellular water . iii . Contrast uptake Post-contrast perfusion image already clinical use ERA . In study , post-contrast mDixon image develop validate . Patients inject intravenous contrast scan fixed delay . Inflamed joint analyse post-contrast image , compare pre-contrast image determine contrast uptake . Inflamed joint analyse use region-of-interest ( ROI ) analysis . Again , quantitative score correlate clinical data STIR score biological validation . 5 . Group B ( ERA , extend oligoarticular polyarthritis ) - Whole Body Scoring Whole-body image score use selection method , validate conventional measure determine optimal approach . Techniques include qualitative 'joint count ' also quantitative analysis affect joint use histographic technique . 6 . Clinical Data Clinical data collect part routine care , conjunction specialist adolescent young adult rheumatologist Arthritis UK Centre Adolescent Rheumatology UCLH . Validated clinical measure disease activity document clinic visit physician global assessment disease activity , juvenile arthritis disease activity score ( JADAS ) , Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ - measure function ) , biochemical ( blood ) marker inflammation C-reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate ERA validate measure disease activity spondyloarthritis collect ( Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI ) , Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index ( BASFI ) Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index ( ASDAS ) . All measure collect part routine clinical care . Patients ' medication use document clinic attendance part routine care . This data also analyse part study clinical measure disease activity treatment correlate radiological measure inflammation ( e.g . apparent diffusion coefficient fat fraction ) time . Clinical data store electronic medical record ( routine data collection UCLH ) . For analysis , data download onto secure hospital university computer encrypt form . 7 . Statistical analysis Statistical approach choose biologically validate quantitative marker inflammation ( ADC , fat fraction contrast uptake ) JIA . Analyses include : - Analysis correlation clinical score list radiological measure . - Comparison ADC , FF contrast uptake affect joint compare normal joint - Comparison ADC , FF contrast uptake affect joint treatment compare treatment In addition , patient undergo serial scan treatment . The study aim determine whether ADC , fat fraction measure contrast uptake correlate measure disease response ( include clinical biochemical measurement ) . Statistical analysis choose collaboration university statistician Cancer Trials Centre ( Dr Andre Lopes ) . Correlation analyse Group A perform use Pearson product-moment correlation . In Group B , mixed regression model use evaluate association whole body inflammation score clinical score . Intra- inter-observer variability calculate parameter ( group ) use interclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) analysis Bland-Altman plot . Sample size calculation also perform collaboration Dr Andre Lopes . It expect approximately 100 patient recruit group A B , provide sufficient statistical power . nquery advisor use calculate sample size . For group A , assumption follow : 1-sided alpha 5 % , power 80 % , null correlation 0.50 alternative correlation 0.70 This suggest required sample size 65 patient . A sample size 88 patient provide power 90 % . For group B , pilot data available , comparable effect size therefore sample size assume ( approximately 100 patient ) . 8 . Long term goal ( beyond scope study ) 1 . The study aim determine whether measure inflammation impact clinical management . This could achieve compare treatment decision make clinician ADC , FF contrast uptake information available compare 'virtual clinic ' . Whether scan available determined random ( NB : As virtual clinic environment impact patient ' actual management ) . WB-MRI may particular value regard , potential reveal inflammation joint patient clinician aware . 2 . A , long term goal determine whether inflammatory burden correlate health outcome . If patient great inflammatory burden poorer long term outcome , argument earlier , aggressive biologic therapy patient . Data also collect beyond five year ( ten year ) allow prospective identification radiological predictor poor outcome adult JIA analyse scan data adolescent year . 3 . Introduction Clinical Practice If quantitative measure inflammation show significantly change clinical practice , scan technique introduce routine clinical care . These technique also potential useful inflammatory disorder , rheumatoid arthritis adult .</detailed_description>
