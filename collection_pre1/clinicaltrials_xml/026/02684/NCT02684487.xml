	<detailed_description>Sepsis clinical entity complicate infection [ 1 ] . Without early recognition timely management , rapidly progress severe sepsis , septic shock , culminate multiple organ dysfunction syndrome . The incidence severe sepsis 300 1000 case per 100,000 person [ 2 ] project increase annually due age population , increase burden chronic disease , great use invasive procedure , chemotherapy , immunosuppressive agent [ 3 ] . Severe sepsis lead cause mortality critically ill patient , healthcare cost exceed $ 16 billion annually [ 4 ] . Despite evolve clinical guideline sepsis [ 5-7 ] , intense research , modest reduction case fatality rate document last two decade [ 8 ] . Aside early administration antibiotic , effective stand-alone adjuvant pharmacological intervention improve survival patient severe sepsis . The degree immune dysfunction precipitate incite infection think correlate severity sepsis . Recently , key cell immune system show express vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) [ 9 ] . Additionally , macrophage neutrophils activate VDR up-regulate expression endogenous antimicrobial peptide ( AMPs ) active broad spectrum infectious agent [ 10 ] . AMPs , influence vitamin D status , likely represent important first-line defense microbial invasion . While circulate 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ) abundant vitamin D metabolite [ 11 ] , normal circumstance , 85-90 % 25OHD tightly bind vitamin D binding protein ( DBP ) unavailable activate innate immune response acute stress [ 12 ] . The remain 10-15 % readily bioavailable ( b25OHD ) , compose free albumin-bound component 25OHD . Fluid loading , albumin wasting , increase DBP expression critical illness may affect 25OHD homeostasis [ 13 ] . Low vitamin D status ( 25OHD &lt; 20ng/mL ) associate increased mortality critical illness [ 14 ] . Forty 70 % septic patient low vitamin D status [ 15-17 ] , yet little known impact vitamin D3 ( vitD3 ) supplementation patient population . As , investigator propose randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial test hypothesis early , rapid correction low vitamin D status , adjunct establish treatment guideline , improve clinical outcome measurably alter immune profile patient severe sepsis . Patients assign single dose vitD3 ( 400,000 IU ) placebo ( n=300/arm ) within 24 hour new-onset severe sepsis , follow weekly dos vitD3 ( 25,000 IU ) placebo , respectively , 90 day assess clinical outcome key biomarkers . AIM 1 : To determine early administration vitD3 ( vs placebo ) improve clinical outcome patient low vitamin D status severe sepsis . Hypothesis 1a : Early vitD3 decrease 90-day mortality onset severe sepsis ( Primary Outcome ) . Hypothesis 1b : Early vitD3 decrease sequential organ failure assessment score first 5 day onset severe sepsis . Hypothesis 1c : Early vitD3 decrease non-home discharge rate survive severe sepsis . AIM 2 : To determine early administration vitD3 ( vs placebo ) modulate b25OHD , AMPs , key cytokine patient low vitamin D status severe sepsis . Hypothesis 2a : Early vitD3 increase b25OHD first 5 day onset severe sepsis . Hypothesis 2b : Early vitD3 increase expression AMPs , cathelicidin ( LL-37 ) β-defensin ( hBD-2 ) . Hypothesis 2c : Early vitD3 decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1β , IL-6 ) increase anti-immunoparalytic cytokine ( IL-10 , IFN-γ ) expression . Severe sepsis significant public health problem limit treatment option . A 2010 NIH workshop sepsis identify deep gap understand innate host immune response sepsis emphasize need novel therapy [ 18 ] . The propose trial well powered investigate whether immunomodulation vitD3 improve survival severe sepsis . By optimize endogenous host response infection , investigator anticipate vitD3 supplementation augment life-saving impact current therapy severe sepsis . Moreover , investigator investigate several vitamin D-related biomarkers , may identify future therapeutic target . The trial perform highly-experienced team include expert vitamin D , sepsis , critical care , clinical trial ; successfully carry several clinical study vitamin D critically ill patient .</detailed_description>
