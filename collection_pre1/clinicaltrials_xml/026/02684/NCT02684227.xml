	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Combination With Carboplatin Paclitaxel Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign either Safety Lead-in Phase 2 portion . The study group depend join study . In Safety Lead-in , study cycle 21 day . In Phase 2 , first study cycle ( Cycle 0 ) 28 day , study cycle 21 day . If enrol Safety Lead-in phase , receive carboplatin paclitaxel Day 1 Cycles 1-9 . You also take enzalutamide every day . If enrolled Phase 2 , take enzalutamide every day first cycle ( call Cycle 0 ) . You receive paclitaxel carboplatin vein Day 1 Cycles 1-9 . You also continue take enzalutamide every day time . In phase , study drug dos may lower side effect . The dose find appropriate safety lead-in use Phase 2 . Study Drug Administration : Paclitaxel give vein 3 hour . Carboplatin give vein 1 hour . You take 4 enzalutamide capsule mouth time every morning 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You may take dose without food . The capsule swallow whole crushed cut . If forget take dose , may take within 12 hour usual dosing time . If vomit within 30 minute take dose , take dose . If side effect , doctor may decide low dose . You give study drug diary write take dose study drug miss dos . You bring study drug diary unused study drug clinic visit . Study Visits : Cycle 0 Study Visits ( Phase 2 participant ) : At Week 1 Cycle 0 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At Week 2 Cycle 0 , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At Week 3 Cycle 0 , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At Week 4 Cycle 0 : - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test . - You type biopsy screening . Study Visits All Participants : At Week 1 Cycles 1-9 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At Weeks 2 3 Cycles 1-9 , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At Week 1 Cycle 2 , blood ( Â½ teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test dose 8 time next 7 hour start dose . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . At Week 3 Cycle 3 every 9 week , x-ray , CT scan , PET-CT scan , MRI check status disease . Anytime doctor think need , part routine blood sample use check well blood clot . Length Treatment : You may continue receive study drug Cycle 9 . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit ( describe ) . Follow-Up Visits : After stop taking study drug , return clinic every 3 month 1 year , often doctor think need . At visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You x-ray , CT scan , PET-CT scan , MRI check status disease . This investigational study . Enzalutamide FDA approve treatment certain type prostate cancer . Paclitaxel carboplatin FDA approve treatment ovarian cancer . The use combination 3 drug treat endometrial cancer investigational . Up 69 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis ( either primary surgical specimen biopsy recurrence ) advance stage ( stage III IV ) recurrent endometrioid endometrial cancer . 2 . Measurable disease ( least one measurable lesion ) IS require . A measurable lesion one accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must &gt; 10 mm measure CT scan , MRI , caliper measurement clinical exam ; &gt; 20 mm measure Chest XRay . Lymph node must &gt; 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI . 3 . Patients must least one `` target lesion '' use assess response protocol define RECIST . Tumors within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy . 4 . Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; /= 1 . 5 . Life expectancy great 3 month opinion principal investigator . 6 . Recovery effect recent surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy . 7 . Patients free active infection require antibiotic ( exception uncomplicated UTI ) . 8 . Any hormonal therapy direct malignant tumor must discontinue least one week prior registration . 9 . Any prior therapy direct malignant tumor , include immunologic agent , must discontinue least three week prior registration . 10 . PRIOR THERAPY : Patients NO prior chemotherapy agent advance recurrent endometrial cancer . Prior chemotherapy administration conjunction primary radiation therapy radiosensitizer would NOT exclude patient participation trial . 11 . Patients must adequate : ( 1 ) Bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1,500/mcl , equivalent Common Terminology Criteria ( CTCAE v4.03 ) grade 1 ; Platelets &gt; /= 100,000/mcl ; ( 2 ) Renal function : calculated creatinine clearance ( CockcroftGault formula ) &gt; 50 ml/min OR 24hour urine creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min ; ( 3 ) Hepatic function : Bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 x ULN ( CTCAE v4.03 grade 1 ; patient know Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; /=3.0 x ULN , direct bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 x ULN ) . AST alkaline phosphatase &lt; /= 2.5 x ULN ( CTCAE v4.03 grade 1 ; AST ALT &lt; /= 3 x ULN ( &lt; /= 5.0 x ULN hepatic metastasis present ) ; ( 4 ) Neurologic function : Neuropathy ( sensory motor ) &lt; /= CTCAE v4.03 grade 1 ; [ Continued Criterion 12 ] 12 .

Patients may receive strong CYP2C8 inhibitor , CYP2C8 inducer , CYP3A4 inducer . In addition , patient receive drug metabolize CYP3A4 CYP2C9 . 8 . Patients pregnant nursing . The effect enzalutamide develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 9 . Patient major surgery within 28 day prior start study drug recover major side effect surgery . 10 . Patients may history malignancy except basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , unless diseasefree least five year . 11 . Patients predispose factor seizure include history seizure , underlie brain injury loss consciousness , transient ischemic attack within past 12 month , cerebral vascular accident , brain metastasis , brain arteriovenous malformation . 12 . Patient history allergic reaction hypersensitivity attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition enzalutamide , carboplatin , paclitaxel . 13 . Patients may symptomatic , uncontrolled spinal cord compression and/or brain metastasis . A scan confirm absence brain metastasis require . Patients receive stable dose corticosteroid before/ study start least 28 day prior entry . 14 . As judged Investigator , evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , severe hepatic impairment , interstitial lung disease [ bilateral , diffuse , parenchymal lung disease ] , uncontrolled chronic renal disease [ glomerulonephritis , nephritic syndrome , Fanconi Syndrome Renal tubular acidosis ] ) , current unstable uncompensated respiratory cardiac condition , uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure &gt; /= 160/90 ) , active bleeding diatheses active infection include hepatitis B , hepatitis C , human immunodeficiency virus . Screening chronic condition require . 15 . As judged Investigator , patient unsuitable participate study patient unlikely comply study procedure , restriction , requirement .</criteria>
