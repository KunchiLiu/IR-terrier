	<brief_summary>Background : In 2010 , approximately 39000 Canadians end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , prevalence rate dialysis increase 189 % past 2 decade . The annual mortality rate remain high ~15 % , cardiovascular event lead cause death . Intensification conventional dialysis schedule major focus recent year . Currently , Canadian dialysis patient receive conventional in-center hemodialysis ( CHD ) , administer 3-4 hour session 3/week . Recent research focus home nocturnal hemodialysis ( 8 hour hemodialysis home 5-6 nights/week ) , may substantial cardiovascular benefit , include regression leave ventricular ( LV ) hypertrophy , improve LV ejection fraction enhance blood pressure control . Nevertheless , dialysis modality feasible highly select minority ESRD patient self-manage dialysis treatment home . In-center nocturnal hemodialysis ( INHD ) , administer 7-8 hour hemodialysis hospital 3nights/week , represent promise practical alternative many dialysis patient . In Canadian Institutes Health Research ( CIHR ) support cohort study , investigator recruit 67 patient complete 1-year follow-up . There compel need longer-term follow-up , since publish randomize control trial short duration ( 6-12 month ) , renal replacement therapy life-long treatment . Furthermore , observe large variability cardiac remodel individual ESRD patient remain poorly understood . Therefore , current study extend follow-up phase ( 5 year enrollment ) complete 1-year follow-up period purpose study objectively evaluate long-term effect intensified hemodialysis treatment INHD modality offer . Need Long-term Generalizable Data : In contrast seminal Alberta trial show significant LV mass reduction home nocturnal hemodialysis , recently report Frequent Hemodialysis Network Nocturnal Trial demonstrate trend toward reduction LV mass . It likely highly select participant , inadequate trial power duration ( 12 month ) account observed result . Currently , unknown whether INHD , less intensive feasible ESRD patient , associate similar cardiovascular benefit long term . Objective : 1 . To determine long-term effect INHD ( ) LV mass ; ( ii ) global regional LV systolic diastolic function ; ( iii ) myocardial tissue characteristic ; ( iv ) leave atrial structure function ; ( v ) select cardiovascular biomarkers ESRD patient . 2 . To examine determinant mechanisms cardiac remodel ESRD Hypothesis : Conversion INHD associate sustained improvement cardiovascular structure function , compare conventional hemodialysis ( CHD ) patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Study Design Population : This 2-centre , prospective , longitudinal cohort study 67 adult ESRD patient ( INHD subject CHD control ) enrol original study . All eligible participant provide consent undergo cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) examination bloodwork 5 year since enrollment study . Other follow-up procedure include follow -electrocardiogram , transthoracic echocardiogram , ambulatory blood pressure monitoring , lateral x-ray aorta , completion questionnaire . Outcome : The primary endpoint change LV mass 5 year , measure cardiac MRI . Secondary endpoint include LV size , global regional diastolic systolic function , leave atrial size function , change myocardial tissue characteristic , blood pressure , serum troponin , norepinephrine , Brain Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) , high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein ( hsCRP ) , interleukin-6 , matrix metalloproteinases , fibroblast growth factor-23 , fetuin-A , transform growth factor-beta , connective tissue growth factor , clinical event , quality life . Significance : The provision enhance dialysis regimen emerge promising avenue modify dismal cardiovascular outcome patient receive chronic hemodialysis . INHD represent mean administer therapy broad spectrum dialysis patient home therapy would feasible . This study first precisely define long-term cardiac effect intensify dialysis elucidate mechanism cardiac remodel ESRD , use cardiac MRI novel biomarkers . These important observational finding may major impact optimal management outcome ESRD patient real world .</brief_summary>
