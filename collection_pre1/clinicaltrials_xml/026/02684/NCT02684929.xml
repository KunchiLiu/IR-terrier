	<brief_summary>Branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA ) belong among nutrient strongly link insulin sensitivity ( IS ) measure . Their exact effect IS appear dependent various condition remain well define . The aim current study investigate effect chronic increase BCAA intake IS two group healthy subject differ basal consumption BCAA , i.e . vegan omnivore . Interventional trial design vegan omnivores separately interveined 15 ( woman ) 20 ( men ) grams BCAA daily . Examinations participant intend do baseline , intervention wash-out period . Examinations ( anthropometry , hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp , arginine test ) blood analysis perform baseline , intervention 6 month wash-out period . Samples subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue ( AT ) skeletal muscle ( SM , vastus lateralis ) obtain intervention use various analysis ( mRNA level select metabolic marker , fatty acid composition , mitochondrial activity ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects method Listed elsewhere Intervention Listed elsewhere Clinical examination Each subject underwent basic medical check-up anthropometric examination ( height ( ) , weight ( kg ) , BMI ( kg/m2 ) , waist circumference ( cm ) , waist-hip ratio ) . Body composition measure use bioimpedance analysis ( BIA , Nutriguard-M , Data Input GmbH , Germany ) . Each mention measurement perform three time mean record . Dietary assessment Each participant fill prospective questionnaire , dietary data 3 day collect ( 2 work day , 1 weekend day ) . For dietary intake calculation Nutridan program use . As nutritional data special vegan product available database , vegan ask collect package product producer declare nutritional content , data use calculation . Saccharides , lipid protein intake calculate separately . BCAA content dietary protein estimate use nutritional database . Physical activity assessment Physical activity assess whole sample use Baecke questionnaire habitual physical activity [ 1 ] , correlate well maximum oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) [ 2 ] . Maximal exercise test perform subject electromagnetically braked bicycle ergometer ( Ergoline 800 , Bitz , Germany ) determine peak oxygen uptake ( Vo2peak ) . An initial workload 50W increase 25 W every minute continuously fatigue despite verbal encouragement . Oxygen uptake measure use Vmax , Sensor Medics ( Yorba Linda , CA ) . Heart rate monitor continuously . Laboratory analysis Peripheral venous blood drawn subject 12 hour fast . Parameters glucose homeostasis assess certified University hospital laboratory : plasma glucose use hexokinase reaction ( kit KONELAB , Germany ) , HbA1c use high-pressure liquid boronate afinit chromatography ( Primus corporation ) , insulin use solid phase competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay ( Immulite 2000 ) . Lipid profile : total cholesterol triglyceride measure use enzymatic method ( kit KONELAB , Germany ) , HDL-cholesterol use PEG modify enzymatic measurement ( kit ROCHE , Switzerland ) . Plasma level free fatty acid ( FFA ) measure use method already describe [ 12 ] . Briefly , FFA extract together neutral lipid use isooctan clean reverse extraction . FA obtain way derivatized methylesters subsequently analyze use gas chromatography ( GC ) . Serum AA level determine use capillary electrophoresis ( CE ) contactless conductivity detection , already describe detail [ 3 , 4 ] . CE measurement carry use HP3DCE system ( Agilent Technologies , Waldbronn , Germany ) equip built-in contactless conductivity detector . Insulin sensitivity secretion IS assess use 2-hours hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp , method describe elsewhere [ 5 ] . Clamp perform 12-hours fasting standard insulin dose 1mIU/kg/min infusion 15 % glucose solution use . Mean infusion rate steady-state clamp ( 6 consecutive measurement ) use measurement . Glucose disposal express metabolic clearance rate ( MCR , ml.kg-1.min-1 ) correction change glucose pool extracellular fluid ( space correction ) insulin sensitivity index ( MCR divide stady state insulinaemia , MCR/I , ml.kg-1.min-1/mU.l-1 ) . Insulin secretion assess IV arginine test already describe [ 6 ] perform different day ( 7 day ) glucose clamp . Acute insulin response calculate incremental trapezoidal area insulin 30 min test . Muscle biopsy , respiratory chain , citrate synthase enzymes activity Skeletal muscle sample vastus lateralis muscle perform every participant use standard Bergström technique [ 7 , 8 ] . Biopsy perform fasting condition . About 200 mg wet weight obtain . The sample immediately microdissected , weigh , divide respective analysis snap-frozen liquid nitrogen store -80oC analysis . Mitochondrial respiratory chain ( RC ) enzymatic activity citrate synthase ( CS ) activity measure spectrophotometrically muscle homogenate . Muscle homogenates prepared describe [ 9 ] . Briefly , 50 mg SM cut small fragment homogenize ( glass-glass grinder ) 20 volume ice-cold homogenization buffer ( 250 mM sucrose , 20 mM Tris , 40 mM KCl , 2 mM EGTA , protease inhibitor cocktail , pH 7.4 ) . The homogenate centrifuge 1 min 600g 4°C supernatant immediately use analysis . Protein concentration measure aliquot use bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay ( Sigma ) . Activity complex I-IV CS determine accordingly previously publish protocol [ 10-11 ] , modify measurement microplate reader ( Infinite M200 PRO , Tecan ) . All measurement make tetraplicates . Activities RC CS express nmol/min/mg total protein , except complex IV , express Δ log ( A550 ) /min/mg total protein . The enzymatic activity RC complex also normalized activity CS , use marker abundance mitochondrion within tissue . Adipose tissue biopsy Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue ( SAAT ) biopsy perform every participant . Bergström needle use obtain sample subcutaneous fat paraumbilical area already describe [ 12 ] . Biopsy perform fasting condition . About 300 mg wet weight obtain . The sample immediately microdissected , weigh , divide respective analysis snap-frozen liquid nitrogen store -80oC analysis . Quantitative real time PCR ( RT-qPCR ) Total RNA tissue isolate use Lipid Tissue Fibrous Tissue RNeasy Mini Kits ( Qiagen ) . RNA concentration measure Nanodrop1000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Wilmington , USA ) . RNA treat DNAse I ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad CA , USA ) remove contaminate genomic DNA . cDNA prepare 200- 600 ng RNA use High Capacity cDNA archive kit ( Applied Biosystems , Carlsbad CA , USA ) . Equivalent 5 ng RNA use Real Time PCR reaction use Fast Advanced master mix Gene expression assay ( IRS1 , GLUT4 , BCKDHA , BCKDHB , ACOX , CPT1b , PLIN1 , PLIN2 , PLIN5 , FASN , SCD1 , DGAT2 , PPAR-γ ; Applied Biosystems ) . All sample run duplicate . Gene expression target gene normalize expression RPS13 ( glucuronidase , beta ) fold change expression calculate use delta delta Ct method . Fatty acid spectrum AT Fatty acid spectrum AT assess use gas chromatography , method already describe Lepage Roy [ 13 ] modification Rodriguez-Palmero et al . [ 14 ] In brief , method involve chloroform/methanol extraction freeze-dried AT isolate lipid subsequent transesterification esterification FA bound lipid form methyl ester , analyze use gas chromatography . Statistical analysis Data present text , table , figure mean ± SD 95 % CI p-values &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Student t-test use observational sample normally distribute data . Wilcoxon match pairs test use data normally distribute . Intervention sample compare use general linear model test statistical significance difference group . A mixed model ANOVA use assess group × time interaction . Within group time effect intervention assess use repeat measure ANOVA Bonferroni 's multiple comparison . Where two data set within group ( i.e . baseline intervention data data obtain tissue biopsy ) pair t-tests use normally distribute data Wilcoxon test data normally distribute . Pearson 's correlation coefficient calculate express relationship change baseline intervention normally distribute data Spearman 's correlation coefficient calculate data normally distribute . Statistica 9.0 , StatSoft , Inc. USA use perform statistical procedure .</detailed_description>
