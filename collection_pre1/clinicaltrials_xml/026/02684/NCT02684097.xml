	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether tralokinumab helpful treatment alopecia areata . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study total 30 subject moderate severe alopecia areata involve 30-100 % scalp . Expected 50 % subject concomitant alopecia areata ( AA ) atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . Subjects AA alone ( 15 subject ) randomize ( 2:1 ) either receive tralokinumab placebo via subcutaneous injection every 2 week 24 week . Subjects concomitant alopecia areata atopic dermatitis ( 15 subject ) randomize separately 2:1 ratio receive tralokinumab placebo via subcutaneous injection every 2 week 24 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study ass whether tralokinumab helpful treatment alopecia areata . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study total 30 subject moderate severe alopecia areata involve 30-100 % scalp . The researcher expect 50 % subject concomitant alopecia areata ( AA ) atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . The researcher ' experience AD12-14 , past experience psoriasis15 , 16 show biomarker study skin tissue critical understanding key pathogenic pathway upregulated disease well suppressed effective treatment . These mechanistic study couple clinical trial key disease shed light important disease mechanism , explain molecule suppress therapeutic target . Data show IL-13 significantly upregulated AD AA lesion compare nonlesional skin . It important associate clinical response suppression cytokine relate molecule well pathway cytokine skin tissue . Both whole genomic profile individual molecular cellular marker important order understand well anti-IL-13 change/suppress AA-associated pathway compare suppress AD . Since study design gain basic knowledge rather yield information directly relate patient care , result enter participant ' medical record . If , later date , correlation in-vitro test patient ' clinical situation suggest result bear patient ' health , amend protocol submit IRB result make available medical record .</detailed_description>
