	<brief_title>Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Kidney</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigator-initiated , prospective study design evaluate accuracy contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) microbubble contrast agent ( perflutren lipid ; Definity® ) identify malignancy patient kidney disease , know risk factor kidney malignancy , conventional ultrasound ( US ) show indeterminate cystic kidney lesion . The primary objective study estimate sensitivity CEUS diagnose kidney malignancy patient risk factor kidney malignancy compare current gold standard test patient population . Secondary analysis include optimal contrast-enhanced imaging compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) subset patient receive study . The study outcome lead immediate clinical application patient chronic kidney disease . Given cost-effectiveness adverse event profile , excellent potential become establish first line diagnostics general patient population well .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible present study , patient must meet following criterion : 1 . Able provide write informed consent 2 . Willing comply protocol requirement 3 . At least 18 year age 4 . Have kidney disease , define either CKD IIVI , determine estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 90 derive serum creatinine measurement , albuminuria/proteinuria , determine albumin creatinine ratio protein creatinine ratio &gt; 30mg/gm , receive kidney transplant 5 . Have least one kidney lesion identify incompletely characterize noncontrasted US , CT , MR exam patient 's provider recommend followup study evaluation additional imaging test . Patients meet follow criterion exclude enrollment : 1 . Critically ill medically unstable whose critical course observation period would unpredictable ( e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) require oxygen ) 2 . Known hypersensitivity sulfur hexafluoride component perflutren lipid ( Definity® ) 3 . Right left shunt , severe pulmonary hypertension ( Pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 90mmHg ) , adult respiratory distress syndrome 4 . Active cardiac disease include follow : Severe congestive heart failure ( class IV accordance classification New York Heart Association ) Unstable angina . Severe arrhythmia ( i.e . ventricular tachycardia , flutter fibrillation ; ventricular premature complex occur close precede T wave , multifocal complex ) . Myocardial infarction within 14 day prior date propose Definity® administration . Uncontrolled systemic hypertension ( systolic blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mm Hg despite optimal medical management 5 . Is intensive care set 6 . Has unstable neurological disease ( e.g cerebrovascular accident ( include transient ischemic attack ( TIAs ) within 3 month sign informed consent 7 . Has undergone invasive procedure kidney lesion ( e.g . tissue biopsy , surgery , nonsurgical cytoreductive procedure ) since identification lesion via US without contrast 8 . Has medical condition circumstance would significantly decrease chance obtain reliable data achieve study objective : Mental illness Drug abuse 9 . Female patient pregnant lactating ( possibility pregnancy exclude negative serum urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin result , obtain within 24 hour perflutren lipid administration , basis patient history , e.g . : tubal ligation , hysterectomy minimum 1 year without menses ) 10 . Obesity limit obtainment acceptable image</criteria>
