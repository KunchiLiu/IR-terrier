	<brief_summary>Residents rural frontier county experience significant disparity health care access outcomes compare urban counterpart . The organization health care delivery contribute significantly disparity . For rural resident multiple chronic condition , transition along continuum care , system treatment support , disperse location present significant challenge . One critical challenge involve hospitalization treatment require travel location significant distance home disrupts personal family routine . The transition back home also problematic discharge plan adequately account limited access care rural area . Indeed , discharge planning recently describe `` black hole ; '' fragment uncoordinated , contribute poor outcome patient dissatisfaction . The specific aim research ascertain rural patient ' actual experience discharge planning process involve patient rural provider design test contextually appropriate rural option discharge model ( ROADMAP ) improve patient outcome reduce re-hospitalizations .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Residents rural county experience significant disparities health care access outcomes compare urban counterpart . These disparity structural ; base market-based medical care delivery system . For rural resident multiple chronic condition , transition along continuum care , system treatment support , disperse location expose produce disparity . The transition home hospitalization treatment expose current urban bias . Indeed , discharge planning fragment uncoordinated , contribute poor disparity . The specific aim research ascertain rural patient ' actual experience discharge ; involve patient rural provider use data design contextually appropriate rural option discharge model active planning ( ROADMAP ) improve patient outcome reduce disparity . Objectives include : 1 . Ascertain actual patient experience rural discharge process . 2 . Design ROADMAP model fit emerge health service context . 3 . Test ROADMAP 's efficacy enhance patient define outcome . 4 . Design component rapid diffusion . Researchers work four county Missoula Hospital Referral Region total population 53,116 live 12,342 square mile ( 4.3 person per square mile ) . Researchers recruit patient seek treatment St. Patrick Hospital . Patients patient advocate serve Innovations Design Team ( IDT ) create ROADMAP . Researchers first interview patient ( n = 40 ) discharge one rural county . Researchers compare experience guideline . Next , conduct Design Survey ( n=600 ) verify goal important patient . The IDT use finding develop design requirement ROADMAP . Finally , use quasi-experimental research design compare patient design rural ROADMAP standard practice . The primary outcome measure measure reflect patient 's value health-related quality life functional status , well hospital re-admissions . An independent statistician use Hierarchical Linear Modeling examine complex relationship . This approach account patient nested four county correlate error inherent within subject analysis . Health care reform set occasion rapid diffusion ROADMAP . This provide incremental reduction rural disparity . Incorporating patient provider input increase likelihood fit within emerge reimbursement model . Researchers expect ROADMAP reduce re-hospitalizations much 30 % , improve patient recovery return participation daily life .</detailed_description>
