	<brief_summary>The health care burden CKD substantial grow 10-15 % population affect developed develop country . It well establish CKD associate systemic inflammation , promote cardiovascular disease body waste . However , causal therapy treat systemic inflammation , treat adverse consequence remain sparse . As kidney function decline form CKD , oxalate level increase plasma , lead increase systemic exposure oxalate consequent tissue injury . Work investigator show elevated plasma oxalate level activate NLRP3 inflammasome turn lead process release cytokine . The investigator seek test hypothesis oxalate contributes systemic inflammation observe patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . The investigator plan define association plasma oxalate level sign systemic inflammation patient hemodialysis . In second step investigator examine whether hemodiafiltration lower plasma oxalate efficiently hemodialysis reduces sign systemic inflammation . Confirmation hypothesis may lead identification oxalate novel therapeutic target interventional trial aim reduce plasma oxalate patient ESRD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The positive interaction diffusive convective flux suggest hemodiafiltration ( HDF ) high oxalate extraction rate compare hemodialysis ( HD ) . However , evaluate whether HDF low predialysis oxalate level level supersaturation . By use intra-individual approach inclusion/exclusion criterion list study , plan determine plasma oxalate cytokine level 20 patient ( 10 regular duration HD , 10 patient extended duration HD ) dialysis . Subsequently , patient switch HDF plasma oxalate concentration cytokine analyze two week follow HDF treatment . Plasma oxalate ( Pox ) measure begin treatment , mid , end 2 hrs post treatment ( determine rebound ) order provide oxalate kinetics HD/HDF treatment . Cytokines measure pre HD/HDF treatment ass steady state inflammation .</detailed_description>
