	<detailed_description>1 . Hypothesis Pseudophakic center-involved DME eye incomplete response 3-6 anti-VEGF injection ( i.e. , RBZ , BCZ IAI ) similar visual acuity gain , assess AUC analysis ( change baseline randomization ( Time 0 ) BCVA letter 24 week ± 1 week ) , combination treatment regimen consist RBZ ( 0.5 mg ) DEX implant ( 0.7 mg ) vs. monotherapy treatment regimen DEX implant ( 0.7 mg ) . 2 . Description Study procedure : Screening ( Visit 1 ) : At initial visit , study doctor delegate explain study patient , answer question , ask sign inform consent form . If patient agrees participate study , study doctor delegate perform routine examination ; ask question past medical history , current medical condition , medication treatment receive . If patient female , may urine pregnancy test perform . Patients undergo regular eye evaluation . If glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1a ) level available within 12-15 week Visit 1 HbA1c test perform screen . Patients assign one two possible treatment regimen ( 1 . ) combination consist LUCENTIS® ( 0.5 mg ) follow OZURDEX® ( 0.7 mg ) 0-8 day later ( 2 . ) OZURDEX® ( 0.7 mg ) monotherapy . This visit last approximately 1-2 hour . Patients always choice receive medication time split 2 shorter visit . Baseline/Randomization ( Visit 2 ) : If patient eligible receive study treatment ( ) schedule baseline randomization study visit allow collection eye exam data ( intraocular pressure , inflammatory cell , abnormal blood vessel ) ocular coherence tomography OCT . This type eye exam OCT patient typically undergo retina specialist 's office . Additionally , patient undergo special vision test intravenous fluorescein angiogram assess retinal circulation . This visit last approximately 2 hour . The next study visit ( Visit 3 ) schedule 4-5 week . Someone study doctor 's office contact patient prior baseline visit remind next visit Week 4 ( Visit 3 ) : This study visit allow collection eye exam data , vision , eye pressure , OCT . This visit last approximately 1 hour . The next study visit ( Visit 4 ) schedule 4-5 week . Someone study doctor 's office contact patient prior visit remind next visit . Week 8 ( Visit 4 ) : This study visit allow collection eye exam data , vision , eye pressure , OCT . This visit last approximately 1 hour . The next study visit ( Visit 5 ) schedule 4-5 week . Someone study doctor 's office contact patient prior visit remind next visit . Week 12 ( Visit 5 ) : This study visit allow collection eye exam data , vision , eye pressure , OCT . This visit last approximately 1 hour . The next study visit ( Visit 6 ) schedule 4-5 week . Someone study doctor 's office contact patient prior visit remind next visit . Week 16 ( Visit 6 ) : This study visit allow collection eye exam data , vision , eye pressure , OCT . This visit last approximately 1-2 hour . At visit , study doctor determine need retreatment patient 's assign study treatment regimen . If receive treatment , initial treatment administer baseline ( visit 2 ) still work patient re-assessed retreatment study visit 7 . The next study visit ( Visit 7 ) schedule 4-5 week . Someone study doctor 's office contact patient prior visit remind next visit . Week 20 ( Visit 7 ) : This study visit allow collection eye exam data , vision , eye pressure , OCT . This visit last approximately 1-2 hour . At visit , study doctor determine need retreatment patient 's assign study treatment regimen . If receive treatment , initial treatment administer baseline ( visit 2 ) still work patient re-assessed retreatment study visit 8 . The next study visit ( Visit 8 ) schedule 4-5 week . Someone study doctor 's office contact patient prior visit remind next visit . Week 24 ( Visit 8 ) : This study visit allow collection eye exam data , vision , eye pressure , OCT. Additionally ; patient undergo intravenous fluorescein angiogram assess change retinal circulation status . This visit last approximately 2 hour . 3 . Post-Randomization Treatment Study eye evaluate retreatment week 16 week 20 study visit base BCVA CST . If eye experience prior treatment-related AE , retreatment discretion investigator . Retreatments defer : • BCVA letter score ≥ 84 ( 20/20 well ) SD-OCT CST &lt; sex-specific SD-OCT cut-offs : - Zeiss Cirrus : 290 µm woman 305 µm men Retreatments administer : • VA letter score &lt; 84 ( bad 20/20 ) SD-OCT CST ≥ sex-specific SD-OCT cut-offs : - Zeiss Cirrus : 290 µm woman 305 µm men If time investigator wish treat study eye ( ) DME treatment different protocol treatment due perceive failure futility communication must make study investigator . 4 . PATIENT WITHDRAWAL &amp; LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP A study participant right withdrawal study time . If study participant consider withdrawal study , lead investigator respective site personally discuss subject reason discontinuation every effort make accommodate patient . Study participant withdraw ask final closeout visit time test describe protocol visit perform . Study participant AE relate study treatment procedure ask continue follow-up AE resolve stabilize . 5 . Procedures avoid perception undue influence The lead investigator co-investigators site make initial contact person patient . In informed consent process , study explain patient study coordinator question patient answer . A consent form give patient give much time need . If need , patient may take home consent form decide later want participate study . Additionally , patient read understand English , consent form provide language understandable . All patient assure standard care give patient choose participate study . This information include informed consent form help patient decision . All patient instruct contact investigation question concern regard study . 7 . Statistic Methods Data analyze use SPSS Statistics software , level statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 . A single center , 12 month pilot study randomize 40 DME eye 30 subject 1:1 BCZ plus adjunctive DEX implant ( i.e. , BCZ ( 1.25 mg ) baseline monthly retreatment criterion meet except month 5 10 DEX implant ( 0.7 mg ) administer 0.7 mg ) BCZ ( 1.25 mg monthly ) demonstrate similar mean vision gain ( +4.9 ± 12.3 ETDRS letter vs. +5.4 ± 10.7 ETDRS letter ) effective resolution central subfield thickness ( 30 ± 100 µm vs. 45 ± 107 µm ) combination regimen ( Maturi RK , 2013 ; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01309451 http : //clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT01309451 ) . We estimate final sample size least 20 eye per study arm require . Assuming third study eye may lose follow-up require enrolment 30 eye per study arm . 9 . Safety Reporting All adverse event document appropriately describe . The severity adverse event cod mild , moderate , severe ; association intervention cod related , possibly relate relate . The determination severity association decide principal investigator ( PI ) . The PI study also act safety monitor , review adverse event . All serious adverse event unexpected potentially relate research report expedited manner research ethical board , participate centre Health Canada . 10 . Confidentiality 10.1 Data Confidentiality All document relate study , include protocol data collect trial , confidential property principal investigator . 10.2 Patient Confidentiality The investigator preserve confidentiality patient participate study identify time study number use patient ' name CRFs documentation . Patients identify study database trial documentation assign study number . All data handle accordance Federal Personal Information Protection Electronic Documents Act ( effective January 1 , 2004 ) applicable provincial privacy legislation .</detailed_description>
