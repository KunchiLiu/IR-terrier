	<brief_title>Study Evaluate PM01183 Combination With Olaparib Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study split 2 part : open label Phase I dose escalation part follow non-randomized Phase II part , expansion study , patient select tumor recommend dos schedule determine phase I . Phase I : A dose escalation study perform patient advanced metastatic solid tumor without establish standard therapeutic alternative . Phase II : An expansion dose study select patient potential tumor possibly sensitivity PARP inhibitor accord histology , include triple negative breast cancer , high grade serous platinum-resistant ovarian endometrial cancer patient , patient molecular feature endometrial cancer PTEN loss , breast ovarian cancer PTEN loss , know BRCA1/2 germline , somatic mutation somatic methylation . OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : Phase Ib : To establish safety [ dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) ] , orally administer olaparib combination PM01183 patient advance metastatic solid tumor without establish standard therapeutic alternative . Phase II : To assess efficacy term Tumor response rate accord RECIST v1.1 criterion PM01183 combination olaparib select population . Secondary objective Phase Ib : To explore pharmacokinetics PM01183 olaparib administer combination . To determine effect study treatment level PARP activity DNA damage : - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . - Circulating tumor cell ( CTC ) . - Tumor biopsy sample . To evaluate preliminary antitumor activity ( overall response rate ) RECIST combination expose population . Phase II : Progression free survival . Overall Survival . Toxicity profile combination patient enrol study . To explore possible correlation expression certain biomarkers efficacy therapeutic approach . STATISTICAL PROCEDURES - Sample size . Justification Phase I : Between 18-48 patient expect participate Phase Ib part study . The number patient may vary depend upon tolerability combination number dose level require identify MTD . Phase II : A total accrual 73 subject would require , accord MinMax two-stages Simon design . With α-error 0.05 power 90 % , RR poor scenario accord previous one would 24 % , favourable scenario RR would reach 40 % . Progression-free survival accord previous report 3.5 month objective study 6.5 month ( n=56 ) . According objective , maximum sample size 73 patient , first sample size 61 patient ( upper limit first stage rejection : 18 ) . Two stage establish : 1 . In first step 61 evaluable patient include study . If 18 few response observe , study stop due inadequate response rate . Efficacy data patient include first step review independent assessment committee ( IAC ) . 2 . If 19 response observe recruitment continue group 73 evaluable patient . If 23 few response detect among 73 patient , conclude regimen sufficiently active warrant testing . If 24 response observe concluded regimen sufficiently active warrant test posterior Phase III .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients ≥18 year age , upper age limit . Written inform consent obtain prior study specific procedures assessment . Histologically confirm diagnosis cancer : 1 . Phase I : patient advance metastatic solid tumor without establish standard therapeutic alternative . 2 . Phase II : platinumresistant ovarian cancer patient ( epithelial nonmucinous ) , triple negative breast cancer endometrial cancer ( grade ) . For patient include phase II part study , evidence measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria version 1.1 require . 1 . At least one lesion , previously irradiate , accurately measure baseline ≥ 10 mm long diameter ( except lymph node must short axis ≥ 15 mm ) compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) suitable accurate repeat measurement , OR 2 . At least one lesion ( measurable and/or nonmeasurable ) accurately assess ( CT/MRI/plain xray ) baseline follow visit . Patients include phase II part study must receive least one line standard therapy locally advance metastatic disease , develop progression disease afterwards . ECOG score &lt; 2 . Life expectancy ≥ 3 month . Patients must normal organ bone marrow function measure within 28 day prior administration study treatment define : 1 . Haemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL blood transfusion 28 day prior entry/randomisation ( choose whichever applicable study ) . 2 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L . No feature suggestive myelodisplastic syndrome ( MSD ) / Acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) peripheral blood smear c. White blood cell ( WBC ) &gt; 3x109/L d. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L e.

Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional ULN i. Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min . Patients sign inform consent form inclusion study specifies clinical trial treatment entails consent analysis biological sample tumor blood . Patient willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination include follow . Evidence nonchildbearing status woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) * . WOCBP include confirmed menstrual period negative urine serum pregnancy test within 28 day study treatment , confirm prior treatment day 1.. The inclusion WOCBP require use highly effective contraceptive measure ( Appendix H ) . Patients enter study follow exclusion criterion fulfil : Involvement planning and/or conduct study . Previous enrolment randomization present study . Simultaneous participation study involve investigational medicinal product , participate study le 28 day prior start study treatment . For patient included phase I study , previous treatment olaparib PM01183 . For patient include phase II study , previous treatment PARP inhibitor , include olaparib , PM01183 . Patients receive systemic chemotherapy , radiotherapy ( except palliative reason ) , within 2 week last dose prior study treatment ( long period depend defined characteristic agent use ) . The patient receive stable dose bisphosphonates bone metastasis , study long start least 4 week prior treatment study drug . Olaparib PM01183 metabolize mainly CYP3A4 . Therefore , concomitant use know strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketokonazole , itraconazole , telithromycin clarithromycin forbidden . Concomitant use know CYP3A4 strong inducer .
