	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) treatment participant relapse refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma . Participants randomize receive either pembrolizumab brentuximab vedotin 35 three-week cycle treatment . The primary hypothesis study treatment pembrolizumab prolongs Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) Overall Survival ( OS ) participant relapse refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma compare treatment brentuximab vedotin .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Has relapse ( disease progression recent therapy ) refractory ( failure achieve Complete Response ( CR ) Partial Response ( PR ) recent therapy ) Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma meet one follow criterion : 1 . Has fail achieve response progress autologous stem cell transplant ( autoSCT ) . Participants must previous treatment brentuximab vedotin . 2 . Is autoSCT candidate due : chemoresistant disease ( unable achieve CR PR salvage chemotherapy ) , advanced age ( ≥65 year age ) , significant coexist medical condition ( cardiac , renal , pulmonary , hepatic dysfunction ) likely negative impact tolerability autoSCT . Participants &lt; 65 year age refuse autoSCT eligible study . Note : Sponsor review approval participant &lt; 65 year age autoSCT candidate require randomization . Participants must receive least 2 prior multiagent chemotherapy regimens include brentuximab vedotin . Has measureable disease define ≥1 lesion accurately measure least 2 dimension spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan . Minimum measurement must &gt; 15 mm long diameter &gt; 10 mm short axis . Is able provide evaluable core excisional lymph node biopsy biomarker analysis archival newly obtain biopsy Screening ( Visit 1 ) .

Has adequate organ function Female participant childbearing potential must willing use adequate method contraception course study 180 day last dose study drug . Male participant childbearing potential must willing use adequate method contraception start first dose study drug 180 day last dose study drug . Has receive previous treatment brentuximab vedotin . Has hypersensitivity active substance excipients brentuximab vedotin . Is currently participate study investigational agent currently receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose study drug . Has diagnosis immunosuppression receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose study drug . Has prior monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior first dose study drug study recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event ( AEs ) due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) AEs due previously administer agent . Note : If participant receive major surgery , he/she must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start study drug . Has undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within last 5 year . Note : Participants transplant great 5 year ago eligible long symptom graftversushost disease ( GVHD ) . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Participants previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] least 4 week prior first dose study drug neurologic symptom return baseline ) evidence new enlarge brain metastasis . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e. , use disease modify agent , corticosteroid , immunosuppressive drug ) . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid , current pneumonitis . Has active infection require intravenous systemic therapy .
