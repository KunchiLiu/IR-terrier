	<criteria>Signed Written Informed Consent Subjects must sign dated IRB/IEC approve write informed consent form accordance regulatory institutional guideline . Subjects must willing able comply schedule visit , treatment schedule , laboratory testing , study obligation . Target Population Males females ≥ 18 year age Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 . Histologically confirm metastatic HNSCC , include nasopharynx WHO Type IIII histology ; patient simultaneous locoregional disease . Central biopsy review MSKCC require . Subjects must least two lesion : At least one lesion must safely amenable irradiation likely meet criterion delineate Section 9.2.1 judgment treat radiation oncologist . This lesion previously irradiate long prior radiation least 6 month prior project first fraction SBRT long reirradiation dose constraint outline appendix met . A separate , nottobeirradiated lesion measurable CT MRI per RECIST 1.1 criterion . A formalin fix , paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tumor tissue block minimum 3 unstained slide tumor sample obtain via excisional , incisional , core needle biopsy metastatic locoregionally recurrent lesion . A new baseline biopsy need obtain study purpose . If 3 unstained unavailable metastatic locoregionally recurrent lesion , permission PI , FFPE tumor tissue primary disease site time original diagnosis acceptable . For oropharynx nasopharynx primary lesion , documentation viral status require ( e.g . high risk HPV subtype PCR , p16 IHC , HPV ISH , EBER , etc ) . Tests do primary tumor specimen date initial diagnosis outside institution sufficient meet criterion Prior palliative curative radiotherapy must complete least 14 day prior randomization . Immunosuppressive dos systemic medication , steroid absorb topical steroid ( dos &gt; 10mg/day prednisone equivalent ) must discontinue least 14 day prior Nivolumab administration . Screening laboratory value must meet follow criterion ( use CTCAE v4.0 ) obtain within 28 day prior randomization : WBC ≥ 2 K/microliter Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 ; K/microliter Platelets ≥ 100 K/microliter Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/deciliter Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance &gt; 40ml/min use CockcroftGault formula . Female CrCl = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL Male CrCl = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 1.00 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/deciliter ) Calcium level must normalize maintain within normal limit study entry treatment . Subjects initial magnesium &lt; 0.5 mmol/liter ( 1.2 mg/deciliter ) may receive corrective magnesium supplementation continue receive either prophylactic weekly infusion magnesium and/or oral magnesium supplementation . Subjects must rest baseline O2 saturation pulse oximetry &gt; =92 % rest . Reproductive Status Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 28 day prior randomization . Women must breastfeed Women childbearing potential must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception time enrollment duration treatment Nivolumab plus 5 half life plus 30 day total 23 week post treatment completion . Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 % per year . Men receive Nivolumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 31 week last dose investigational product . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal surgically sterile well azoospermic men require contraception . Azoospermic male woman childbearing potential continuously heterosexually active exempt contraceptive requirement . However , still must pregnancy test . Insurance Approval Insurance approval SBRT obtain prior randomization Target Disease Exceptions Active brain metastasis ( untreated brain metastasis growth image define ) leptomeningeal disease allow . Subjects brain metastasis eligible treat MRI ( CT MRI contraindicate ) evidence progression least 8 week treatment metastases complete within 28 day prior first study treatment . Histologically confirm nonsquamous histology allow ; exception make WHO Type IIII nasopharynx histology . Medical History Concurrent Diseases : Any medical disorder , opinion investigator , might increase risk associate study participation interfere interpretation study result . Prior active malignancy within previous 3 year except locally curable cancer basal squamous skin cancer , superficial bladder , low risk prostate cancer , breast , cervix cancer . If prior malignancy active within prior 3 year , enrollment require approval principal investigator . Patients exclude active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger Subjects condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration exclude . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . As potential hepatic toxicity Nivolumab , drug predisposition hepatoxicity use caution patient treat Nivolumabcontaining regimen . Prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 antibody . NBpatients receive prior antiCTLA4 antibody therapy eligible assume therapy discontinue within 28 day enrollment . Treatment chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologics cancer , investigational therapy within 14 day randomization . Physical Laboratory Test Findings Positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid indicate acute chronic infection . Known history test positive HIV know AIDS . Any grade 4 laboratory abnormality . Allergies Adverse Drug Reaction History allergy Nivolumab component History severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody . Prohibited Restricted Treatments The following medication prohibit study : Immunosuppressive agent ( except treat drugrelated adverse event ) . Systemic corticosteroid &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent save exclusion outline paragraph .
