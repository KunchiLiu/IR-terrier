	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test effectiveness three treatment arm design improve survival patient non-small cell lung cancer . Eligible subject could randomize four ( 4 ) cycle chemotherapy follow immunotherapy , immunotherapy follow chemotherapy , four cycle chemotherapy plus immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Sequential Consolidation With Pembrolizumab Followed Nab-paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , three-arm , non-comparative randomized phase II study design evaluate three different sequence double-consolidation humanize monoclonal antibody target cell surface receptor program cell death-1 ( PD-1 ) , pembrolizumab , nab-paclitaxel patient advance Non small cell lung cancer post induction chemotherapy . While goal arm guarantee exposure two agent patient progress post induction chemotherapy , different sequence . In ARMs A B , consolidation sequential , either pembrolizumab follow nab-paclitaxel ( ARM A ) , nab-paclitaxel follow pembrolizumab ( ARM B ) . In ARM C , consolidation concurrent , two agent administer concurrently .</detailed_description>
