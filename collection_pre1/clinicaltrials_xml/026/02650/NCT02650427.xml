	<brief_summary>Boosting tumor cell kill cytotoxic lymphocyte may promise mean enhance anti-tumor immunity . Prior study demonstrate tumor infiltration cytotoxic lymphocytes correlate control tumor growth associate improved prognosis cancer patient . Trafficking activated lymphocyte tightly regulate mechanism specific nature chemokine milieu crucial determinant permit T cell entry tumor microenvironment . CXCL10 interferon-inducible chemokine particularly important recruitment activate T , show enhance anti-tumor response action cytotoxic T cell ( e.g. , glioblastoma , colorectal adenocarcinoma lung carcinoma ) . Additionally , role CXCL10 anti-tumor effector include ability chemo-attract NK cell sit inflammation , ability inhibit development new vasculature induce regression newly form vessel . Adding layer complexity , function CXCL10 regulate dipeptidylpeptidase IV ( DPPIV ) , lead formation dominant negative , antagonist form chemokine . This initially demonstrated vitro , recent work provide convincing vivo evidence antagonist form CXCL10 regulate lymphocyte trafficking . The main goal protocol evaluate tolerance sitagliptin treatment HCC patient , secondary DPPIV inhibitor strategy protect CXCL10 chemokine agonist activity mean enhance tumor regression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate Safety 3 Weeks Sitagliptin Treatment HCC Patients Undergoing Liver Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct 15 patient . Patient selection make base medical record weekly staff meeting . After collection inform consent , patient undergo biopsy tumor not-tumoral liver 2-4 week later HCC resection . The study include phase 3 week [ ± 7 day ] administration sitagliptin monotherapy ( take orally ) liver biopsy HCC resection . The window ± 7 day deliberately wide take account variable arrangement make surgical resection . Nevertheless make effort focus three week regimen . Three dos sitagliptin use : 1 ) 100mg/day ( dose recommend SmCP ) , 2 ) 200mg/day 3 ) 600mg/day ; 5 patient group . Arrangements make surgical resection upon standard care . Blood sample obtain immunology study visit . The study end one week surgery ( less state health patient require stay longer hospital ) . Patients continue treatment HCC prescribe clinician .</detailed_description>
