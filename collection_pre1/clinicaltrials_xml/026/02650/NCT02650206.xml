	<brief_summary>The objective study test hypothesis liraglutide ( commonly know Victoza ) promote anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype human adipose tissue blood , thereby reduce localize systemic inflammation risk factor cardiovascular disease may contribute hyperglycemia . This do 4 week treatment weight remain stable , 12 week , liraglutide-related weight loss occur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Liraglutide ( Victoza ) Inflammation Human Adipose Tissue Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It establish high risk cardiovascular disease associate obesity type 2 diabetes related systemic inflammation underlies condition . Previous study show numerous type immune cell human adipose tissue , macrophage . These cell exist two state : M2 , inhibit classical inflammatory response , M1 secrete proinflammatory cytokine . The investigator data suggest role inflammatory cell adipose tissue strong contributor systemic inflammation . A recent study show GLP-1 analog ( liraglutide , also know Victoza ) may help decrease inflammation via promote M2 differentiation macrophage . The purpose study quantify macrophage phenotype ( M1 v M2 ) subcutaneous adipose tissue moderately-obese diet control diabetic baseline , four week weight-maintenance use liraglutide , 12 week liraglutide treatment compare placebo . Aim 1 : Quantify M1 M2 ( surface intracellular marker ) polarization via flow cytometry subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue peripheral blood mononuclear cell baseline 4 week administration liraglutide versus placebo weight-stable , obese , type 2 diabetic patient . Weight loss prevent order ascertain effect liraglutide alone . Aim 2 : Quantify M1 M2 ( surface intracellular marker ) polarization via flow cytometry subcutaneous adipose tissue peripheral blood mononuclear cell 12 week liraglutide treatment , dietary restriction lift spontaneous weight loss , would occur clinical setting , allow . To eliminate confound weight loss , placebo-treated group undergo match dietary weight loss comparison liraglutide group ascertain whether change macrophage polarization 12 week great liraglutide group . Aim 3 : Quantify macrophage-mediated localized systemic inflammation measure M1/M2-related inflammatory cytokine adipose tissue peripheral blood 4 12 week administration liraglutide versus placebo obese , type 2 diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
