	<brief_title>A Study Of The Safety And Effects Of One Or More Doses Of HSP-130 Injected Under The Skin In Women With Breast Cancer That Has Not Spread To Distant Sites In The Body .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , sequential enrollment study characterize pharmacodynamic ( PD ) , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) safety HSP-130 subject non-metastatic breast cancer previously receive chemotherapy point prior enrollment study ( ZIN-130-1504 ) . The purpose study evaluate effect safety single multiple dos HSP-130 subject non-metastatic breast cancer . This study determine dose move forward future clinical trial . There two aspect study . In initial part study , 6 subject sequentially enrol receive HSP-130 treatment ( 3 mg , 6 mg subcutaneous injection ) period biopsy definitive surgery . This determine whether 3 mg 6 mg similar different effect PD variable ( absolute neutrophil count CD34+ cell count ) . This part study refer Cycle 0 since study subject receive chemotherapy receive HSP-130 effect HSP-130 PD variable know . A total 12 subject may enrol Cycle 0 . The objective Cycle 1-4 determine dose take forward Phase 3 clinical trial . Cycles 1-4 subject receive HSP-130 definitive breast surgery time receive TAC chemotherapy ( docetaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide ) . Subjects receive 4 cycle every 3 week TAC chemotherapy HSP-130 give Day 2 chemotherapy regimen . - If 3 mg dose find inferior ( potentially subtherapeutic ) 6 mg dose Cycle 0 , 6 mg dose study Cycles 1-4 ( n=12 ) , subject receive concomitant chemotherapy . - If 3 mg dose find comparable PD result obtain Cycle 0 6 mg , 3 mg dose ( n=12 ) also study woman receive TAC chemotherapy . Data HSP-130 6 mg regimen ( plus 3 mg , appropriate ) analyse , discuss FDA determination dose great 6 mg appropriate study ( e.g. , 12 mg ) . If three dos study , total enrollment 36 subject project Cycles 1-4 .</detailed_description>
