	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy one main treatment advance NSCLC . However , chemotherapy induce thrombocytopenia ( CIT ) one important limitation subsequent chemotherapy cancer . At present , although platelet transfusion gold standard treat severe CIT , clinical application limit due many disadvantage , short time storage , easy save , risk infection immunological disease . What 's , cytokine include IL-11 rhTPO , useful clinical work . It necessary explore new therapeutic method treat CIT . Researches show spleen resection could improve count PLT . In clinical trial , design chemotherapy plus spleen radiotherapy subject advance NSCLC , simultaneously , underwent grade II bad CIT . The primary endpoint incidence severe CIT ( ≧grade III ) subsequent chemotherapy , second endpoint recovery time bone marrow suppression progression free survival , explore index immulogical status .</brief_summary>
