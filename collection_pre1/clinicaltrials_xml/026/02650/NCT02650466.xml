	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Nanopulse System use clear common wart lesion skin . The Nanopulse System use series low energy , high voltage pulse , one several billionth second duration , effectively kill target tissue contain within applicator tip electrodes minimal damage surround tissue . Efficacy patient outcomes expect equal surpass current treatment modality term increase ease use , faster patient heal minimal scar few complication result treatment . The device emit significantly less energy exist electro-surgery electro-cautery equipment believe similar laser therapy treatment wart . Trained clinician usually diagnose wart base appearance location . Non-genital wart subcategorized common , periungual , flat , filiform , plantar type . Common warts benign , often skin-colored , brown-grey , rough , bumpy growth hand foot ( cause Human Papilloma Virus type 2 ) . Common wart individual without immune deficiency low risk focus study.Based upon preclinical profile Nanopulse device , particularly safety profile effect transform cell , hypothesize application pulse Nanopulse System , result complete clinical clearance Common Wart lesion minimal scarring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objective : The objective study indicate whether Nanopulse System efficacious use clearing common wart . The primary objective study gather lesion clearance data common wart application pulse Nanopulse System determine optimal number treatment necessary . Clearance measure clinical observation . Other objective study include gather efficacy data use Nanopulse System treat common wart term : 1 . ) Safety clinical setting term minimal adverse event course trial ; 2 . ) Cosmetic result heal process cosmetic outcome ; 3 . ) Effects 1 , 2 , 3 4 treatment term clearance cosmetic outcome treat wart ; 4 . ) Subject impression immediately follow application pulse ; 5 . ) Subject satisfaction treatment cosmetic outcome follow heal process ; 6 ) Device performance clinical feedback actual clinical condition gather information design feature may modify optimize device .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Only Common Warts include study lesion . Only discrete common wart single 5cm x 5cm anatomical area include study lesion . Up 4 discrete common wart meet criterion treat per subject . The 5cm x 5cm area must 2 wart present time screen wart outside area must least 2cm away wart include study lesion . Please Note : A single digit ( e.g . finger ) represent 5cm x 5cm area , lesion within area include study lesion UNLESS inside surface digit wart lesion present surface adjacent digit would within 1 cm touch potential study lesion surface digit contact one another . Subject 's lesion may treat overthecounter treatment , prescription medicine , surgery , destructive procedure ( i.e. , cryotherapy ) within four week date subject recruit study . Subject 's wart subject must suitable candidate usual Standard Care treatment . Standard care common wart define curettage electrodesication , cryotherapy , topical therapy surgery . Subject must competent provide inform consent . If subject female , childbearing potential , subject must actively practice clinically acceptable form birth control . Subject 's medical evaluation screen visit indicate finding clinical significance relevant participate study . Subject inform option standard care lesion type outside study . Subjects meet inclusion criterion exclude . Subjects lesion within 5cm x 5cm anatomical area study painful noticeably change prior time screen . Periungual wart exclude study study lesion . Subject inform wart treat duration study . Lesions face exclude study study lesion . Lesions diagnose flat wart , filiform wart , plantar wart , genital wart exclude study study lesion . Subject inform wart treat duration study . Subjects use intend use warts therapy concomitantly study period within 4 week screen visit . Subjects capable undergoing surgical standard care treatment common wart due mental physical limitation . Subjects minor surgical procedure contraindicate ( e.g . advice care clinician ) . Subjects implanted artificial heart valve prosthesis require prophylactic antibiotic coverage minor surgical procedure . Subjects implanted cardiac pacer defibrillator similar life sustaining implanted electrical device . Subjects cosmetic therapeutic procedure ( e.g . use liquid nitrogen , surgical excision , curettage , dermabrasion , medium great depth chemical peel , laser resurfacing ) within 2cm targeted area margin within 4 week screen visit within 10cm treatment area study . Subjects immunosuppressed either due exist medical diagnosis , currently use medication suppress immune system ( e.g . cyclosporine , prednisone , methotrexate , alefacept , infliximab ) use medication within 8 week screen visit anytime study . Topical immunomodulators ( imiquimod , steroid cream ) within 4 week screen visit time study . Prolonged excessive exposure ultraviolet light within 2 week prior screen visit time study . Subjects , female , know currently pregnant lactate actively breastfeed . Under Investigator 's authority exclude participant his/her discretion , participation study recommend Subject .</criteria>
