	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury represent important clinical problem hospitalize patient , persistently high rate mortality morbidity . With ever-increasing number patient receive intravascular injection iodinate contrast medium worldwide , contrast induce nephropathy ( CIN ) become third leading cause hospital-acquired AKI . Approximately half case patient undergoing cardiac catheterization procedure . The prevention early intervention CIN hamper mainly lack consensus definition paucity early predictive biomarkers accurately identify high-risk patient . CIN frequently define increase serum creatinine ( sCr ) 25-50 % baseline , generally occur within first 24 h contrast exposure , absence cause . However , sCr unreliable indicator acute change kidney function , alteration sCr level particularly sensitive specific small change glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) e , gender , race intravascular volume . Biomarkers kidney injury molecule-1 ( KIM-1 ) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) use early diagnosis AKI , although definitive result .</detailed_description>
