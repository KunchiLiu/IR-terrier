	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial study best way TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 cyclophosphamide treat patient solid tumor spread primary site ( place start ) place body ( metastatic ) , progress long time ( persistent ) , come back ( recurrent ) , grow , spread , get bad ( progress ) . TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 together cyclophosphamide may better treatment solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Metastatic , Persistent , Recurrent , Progressive Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess ability dose schedule cyclophosphamide , pegfilgrastim , TLR8 agonist VTX-2337 ( CyNeuMoto ) reproducibly immunomodulate patient manner enhance endogenous antitumor effector response . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability treatment assess adverse event . II . Best overall response rate , assess immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) criterion ( irBORR ) . III . Duration tumor response , assess irRECIST ( irDOR ) . IV . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) measure serial imaging study assess irRECIST . V. Overall survival , measure subject vital status 36 month follow discontinuation study treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test hypothesis regimen prove efficacious immunomodulator regardless number prior chemotherapy ( chemo ) regimens type cancer assess . II . To evaluate baseline immune status patient ( peripheral blood intratumoral effector T cell , regulatory T cell , tumoricidal monocyte , myeloid-derived suppressor cell ) well modulatory effect treatment upon individual immune component . III . To correlate treatment-induced immune modulation clinical outcome ( overall response rate [ ORR ] , progression-free survival [ PFS ] determine immune-related RECIST [ irRECIST ] , overall survival ) . IV . To correlate treatment-induced immune modulation clinical outcome magnitude leukopenia ( surrogate , neutropenia ) achieve treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 2 , TLR8 agonist VTX-2337 SC day -6 course 1 day 9 16 . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) may continue therapy every 21 day 3 additional course . Treatment may continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 36 month .</detailed_description>
