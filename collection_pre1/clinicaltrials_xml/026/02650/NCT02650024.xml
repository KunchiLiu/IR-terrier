	<brief_summary>This partially blind placebo-controlled trial determine impact cure Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) oral direct-acting antiviral ( DAA ) , ledipasvir sofosbuvir single pill , central nervous system ( CNS ) outcomes mono- Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) co-infected individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Hepatitis C Virus Therapy Central Nervous System Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic HCV infection frequently cause neurocognitive ( NC ) mood disorder whether disorder cause HCV concomitant substance use liver disease unclear . Response treatment obscure neurotoxicity interferon-based HCV therapy . Newer DAAs neurotoxic expect treat HCV-induced brain injury . However , clinical trial yet perform determine CNS benefit . This present critical barrier progress field propose clinical trial directly address . The specific aim : AIM 1 : To determine whether cure HCV , indexed 12-week sustain virologic response , result improvement NC performance , neuroimaging , measure daily functioning ; AIM 2 : To determine viral , host , pharmacologic correlate neurocognitive neuroimaging outcome ; AIM 3 : To explore HIV alters relationships observe Aims 1 2 . The propose , innovative clinical trial improve scientific knowledge determine biological imaging correlate CNS systemic effect DAAs well distribution drug CNS . The investigator ' finding also inform clinical guideline practice safety benefit treat HCV substance use population . In people HIV-associated NC disorder HCV infection , treatment DAAs may prove critical adjunct antiretroviral improve cognition return patient functional life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult ( ≥ 18 year old ) subject chronic genotype 1 HCV NCI GDS great equal 0.5 ( n=60 ) . 2 . Presence chronic HCV infection base chart review define positive antiHCV antibody HCV RNA least 6 month screen . 3 . For HIV/HCV coinfected group , subject must HIV . HIV status obtain self report . Self report confirm screen use HIV1 point care test . In event point care test selfreport discordant , HIV status confirm licensed Western blot second antibody test . 4 . HIV/HCV coinfected subject ( n=12 ) must also HIV RNA measurement &lt; 50 copies/mL pretreatment visit . 5 . Laboratory value : Platelets &gt; 150,000 Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 10x upper limit normal Creatinine clearance &gt; 30 milliliters/minute/1.73 centimeter square 1 . Ledipasvir ( LDV ) /Sofosbuvir ( SOF ) know drug interaction coadministered follow drug : Amiodarone Pglycoprotein ( Pgp ) inducer ( e.g. , rifampin , St. John 's wort ) 2 . Cirrhosis bridge fibrosis ( Modified hepatic activity index ( mHAI ) stag 46 equivalent ) . Liver biopsy time show mHAI stage 4 high fibrosis OR FibroScan within 12 month demonstrate liver stiffness ≥9.5 kilo Pascal AST platelet ratio index ( APRI ) ≥2.0 Fibrosis4 ( FIB4 ) ≥3.25 NOTE : If APRI FIB4 discordant one form fibrosis staging must use . 3 . Known allergy/sensitivity hypersensitivity component study drug formulation . 4 . Any cause liver disease chronic HCV infection , include limited following : Hemochromatosis Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency Wilson 's disease Autoimmune hepatitis Alcoholic liver disease Drugrelated liver disease 5 . Severe NC confounding condition ( stroke , head injury , developmental learn disability ) . 6 . Regular use antiinflammatory drug . 7 . Current recent treatment pegylated interferon ( PEGIFN ) . 8 . Other active inflammatory process ( major infection , malignancy , rheumatoid arthritis/autoimmune disorder ) within prior 28 day . 9 . Contraindications magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . 10 . Bleeding diathesis , thrombocytopenia , use anticoagulant would contraindicate lumbar puncture . 11 . Uncontrolled active depression psychiatric disorder opinion site investigator might preclude adherence study requirement impact NC function assessment . 12 . Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion site investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . 13 . Presence active acute AIDSdefining opportunistic infection within 12 week prior study entry .</criteria>
