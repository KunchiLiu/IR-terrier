	<detailed_description>When patient meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion , neuroimaging protocol obtain baseline , prior trial implantation SCS . Normal trial period respect base reimbursement rule Belgium ( 4 week ) . When patient eligible implantation definitive SCS system ( 50 % pain reduction and/or 50 % reduction pain medication ) , patient undergo surgery definitive implantation . After stabilisation stimulation parameter least 1 month , second session neuroimaging occur ( T1 ) . Minimal one month later ( 2 month implantation definitive SCS system ) patient undergo last session neuroimaging ( T2 ) . The MRI protocol occur stabilisation stimulation parameter least 1 month . During whole period , patient fill VAS diary time neuroimaging T1 T2 Likert-scale order evaluate satisfaction grade patient . Additionally , patient also wear 1 month neuroimaging Actiwatch , measure sleep pattern fill questionnaire baseline , T1 T2 ( Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) .</detailed_description>
