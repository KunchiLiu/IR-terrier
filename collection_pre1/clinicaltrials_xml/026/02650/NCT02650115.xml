	<brief_summary>Chronic liver diseases common two main cause France NAFLD ( No Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Nonalcoholic ) ALD ( alcoholic liver disease ) . Because importance current global obesity , NAFLD become common estimate prevalence general population reach 20-30 % . NAFLD ( No Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Nonalcoholic ) ALD ( alcoholic liver disease ) include broad spectrum liver damage , range simple steatosis isolate ( infiltration fat liver ) , hepatic inflammation , fibrosis ( abnormally high accumulation extracellular component functional liver tissue ) finally cirrhosis complication . Choline deficiency ( essential nutrient generally classified Class B vitamin ) associate liver damage characterize NAFLD ALD . The amount choline body depend particular food intake degradation choline intestinal microbiota . NAFLD ALD complex pathology result interaction environmental / nutritional factor genetic background . It therefore appear necessary study influence relationship genetic predisposition , environmental factor , gut microbiota metabolism choline severity liver injury observe NAFLD ALD . If interaction three element ( host genetics - environmental factor - intestinal microbiota metabolic choline ) influence severity lesion NAFLD ALD direct application may bring food supplement choline patient risk ( mutation PEMT gene ( phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase ) , postmenopausal woman , microbiota profile increase degradation dietary choline ) restore amount choline body thus avoid worsen ALD NAFLD progression cirrhosis .</brief_summary>
