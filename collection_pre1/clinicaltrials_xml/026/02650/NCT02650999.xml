Age 18 year old day signing inform consent . Have baseline imaging within 6 week enrollment ( CT , MR PET/CT image ) measurable disease physical examination image study . Not pregnant breastfeed Any lesion 1.5 cm long axis dimension consider measurable . Performance status 02 ECOG Performance Scale Demonstrate adequate organ function . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,000 /mcL Platelets≥50,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Serum creatinine OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( aCreatinine clearance estimate per institutional standard ) ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN . AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant . 1 . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . An exception make patient received CTL019/CTL119 experimental protocol ; patient eligible enroll progression disease failure respond document clinical radiologic assessment . 2 . Patient receive intervene therapy lymphoma CTL019/CTL119 infusion . 3 . Has active cytokine release syndrome CTL019/CTL119 infusion . 4 . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) . 5 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 6 . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Toxicities disease related exclude patient . 7 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention opinion Principal Investigator prior start therapy . 8 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . 9 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . 10 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 11 . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 12 . Has active infection require systemic therapy . 13 . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . 14 . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . 15 . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . 16 .
