	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine link cadence ( number step take minute ) intensity physical activity ( e.g . low- , moderate- vigorous-intensity ) adult ( 21-85 year old ) . The investigator anticipate cadence good indicator exercise intensity . Identifying cadence relate activity intensity allow physical activity guideline communicate public manner accessible lay person .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There two lab visit CADENCE-ADULTS participant , complete Physical Activity Health Lab University Massachusetts Amherst . Participation include : orientation experiment , consent , physical examination test . The entire research protocol last 3.5-4.5 hr . For participant first visit consist orientation project , screen , informed consent , physical exam ECG ( necessary , see ) , well grade treadmill walk protocol . Pre-visit : Prior come laboratory participant undergo phone screen order identify interest , outline basic inclusion/exclusion criterion give brief description study protocol . If interested participant schedule first visit give instruction arrive laboratory observe least 4-hour fast . The reason require fast metabolic response exercise affect food intake . By fast 4 hrs prior exercise test window investigator insure standardization metabolic response exercise . Orientation : Participants take slide orientation session aspect study cover . This slide set write pictorial description different phase experiment , eligibility criterion , participant right , compensation confidentially . At time participant opportunity ask question experimenter would like . Consent : If present orientation information person would like enroll study give informed consent document . They give ample opportunity read document decide would like sign paper enroll study . Pre-testing screening : Once consent paperwork sign participant height , seat height , body weight , body fat percentage , BMI , waist circumference take . Questions also ask ascertain date birth , gender race/ethnicity . Participants take series screen questionnaire assess cardio-metabolic risk via recent edition American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) Resource The Health Fitness Specialist also American heart Association 's ( AHA ) risk stratification recommendation present ACSM resource . Risk assess follow way : For participant consider low risk ( men 21-44 year age woman 21-54 year age , asymptomatic ≤ 1 risk factor ) physical examination rest ECG necessary prior enrol study . Those consider moderate risk ( men 45- 69 woman 55-69 year age , asymptomatic ≥ 2 risk factor ) require physical examination rest ECG prior enrol study . Those consider high risk ( symptomatic , know cardiac , pulmonary metabolic disease ) , find high risk follow risk stratification , require medical supervision submaximal treadmill exercise protocol . All participant 70-85 year age require physical examination rest ECG prior enrol . Physical Exam ECG : A physical exam conduct study staff guidance medical examiner ( Dr. Chipkin ) assess medical condition may interfere exercise protocol . In addition , perform ensure participant safety exercise protocol . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . A 12-lead electrocardiogram perform study staff review ACSM certify exercise specialist ( clinical exercise physiologist ) MD prior exercise protocol . All test overseen train study staff MS PhD Exercise Science/Physiology BS Kinesiology . These accommodation meet ACSM AHA criterion exercise protocol . Experimental Testing : Immediately prior exercise test participant outfitted number non-invasive device measure/monitor physical activity . Additionally outfitted wireless metabolic mask measure gas exchange criterion measure energy expenditure . Participants complete treadmill test mock free-living activity physical activity oxygen uptake continually concurrently measure . Both speed treadmill free-living activity perform 5 minute 2 minute rest activity . Participants complete activity prefer level effort . Treadmill walk : Participants complete series walk bout treadmill physical activity oxygen uptake concurrently assess . The walking bout start 0.5 mile per hour end 6 mile per hour ( 0.5 mile per hour increment ) . Treadmill test terminate follow criterion attain : upon natural tendency reach use hand rail steady and/or support , follow completion fist bout heart rate attain 75 % age-predicted maximum heart rate ( indicative achieve vigorous intensity ) , participant identify 14/20 great level exertion Borg Rate Perceived Exertion Scale , follow completion first bout participant naturally selects run instead walk , follow completion bout 6.0 mph , criterion , participant prefers , reflect personal tolerance . Free-Living Activities : Participants rest chair , watch portion movie seat chair , complete seat computer work , walk set stair , fold laundry standing , vacuum floor . Participant complete continuous walk 5 minute desire pace . This walk complete corridor electronic gait mat ( GaitRite , Inc. , USA ) cover portion walk course . Following completion test , participant give small snack drink monitor ensure safe return day .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adults age 2185 year , able ambulate treadmill ( selfreport ) BMI le 18 40kg/m^2 Having smoke tobacco within past 6 month wheelchair bound , condition prevent normal ambulation Resting systolic blood pressure &gt; 159 mm HG , diastolic blood pressure &gt; 99 mm HG Hospitalization mental illness within past 5 year . Any condition/medication may affect heart rate response exercise testing . Previous history , clinical symptom sign , cardiovascular disease , stroke transient ischemic attack , chest pain , unusual dyspnea physical activity/exercise , severe ankle swelling , leg pain walk . Any significant medical condition may interfere study . Previous history musculoskeletal injury problem cause severe pain physical activity exercise interfere daily activity . Participant pacemaker implant medical device ( include metal joint replacement ) . Participant pregnant . Participant unable complete testing ( 1 two session , base risk factor ) within maximal two week period . Individuals wear full beard may need exclude study , large amount facial hair around mouth nose interfere seal device measure air breath . Because seek participant cleanshaven beard area around nose mouth cleanshaven ( e.g . goatee ) .</criteria>
