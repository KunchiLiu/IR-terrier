	<brief_title>Efficacy Smart Management Strategy Health ( SMASH ) Program Overcoming Cancer Crisis Growing Positively</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>&lt; Hypothesis &gt; This study hypothesize intervention provide ( SMASH program ) demonstrate improvement cancer survivor ' health management field ( ) physical activity , body mass index , positive growth , ( ii ) self-management strategy health ( SMASH Assessment Tool ; SAT ) , ( iii ) overall physical , mental , social , spiritual health condition Quality Life ( QoL ) , ( iv ) execution maintenance health habit ( `` 10 Rules Highly Effective Health Behavior '' ) . &lt; Patient registry &gt; Cancer survivor , complete cancer treatment ( surgery , radiation , chemotherapy ) , recruit five medical center Korea randomly allocate one follow three group : 2 experiment group 1 attention control group . This recruitment process would start approval protocol Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , proceed follow step : ( ) physician charge confirm patient finish treatment determine whether patient eligible participate study check recent ( less one year ) result patient 's basic medical exam ( blood pressure , body temperature , heart rate , respiratory rate , weight , height ) basic lab test ( blood chemistry , electrocardiogram , chest PA , complete blood count , liver function test , BUN/Cr ) , ( ii ) A nurse explains purpose method study patient , ask complete informed consent form , ( iii ) patient agree participation complete brief screen questionnaire ( Godin 's Leisure Time Exercise , weight/height , PostTraumatic Growth Inventory ( PTGI ) ) , ( iv ) patient meeting criterion determine screen questionnaire ask complete baseline assessment questionnaire home , ( v ) case finish baseline assessment questionnaire meet criterion consider study participant randomly assign one three study arm . &lt; Quality control ( patient data ) &gt; This study assume patient directly refer study collaborate physician valid cancer case . Data collect study participant screen form review researcher central institution miss response inconsistency . &lt; Sample size &gt; The sample size 485 participant base upon follow assumption : - two-sided Type I error 0.05 - drop-out rate 20 % - attainment goal behavior 5 % active comparator arm 20 % experiment arm , power 90 % detect between-arm difference &lt; Statistical analysis plan &gt; All analysis conduct basis intention-to-treat . Arm differences 3 , 6 , 12 month behavior change ( physical activity , body mass index , posttraumatic growth ) test logistic regression , control respective baseline value . Arm difference level Mini Dietary Assessment Index ( MDI ) , execution health habit , SMASH Assessment Tool ( SAT ) , Quality Life ( QoL ) , health condition , incurred medical expense , incur Complementary Alternative Medicine ( CAM ) expense explore use mixed model estimate effect SMASH program time , correlate repeat observation particular participant adjustment baseline score .</detailed_description>
