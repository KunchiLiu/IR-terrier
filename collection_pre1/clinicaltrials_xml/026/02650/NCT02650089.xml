	<brief_summary>Both work activity reduce nocturnal dipping blood pressure relate increase cardiovascular risk . The aim present study assess hemodynamic autonomic response university professor teach sleep time different resistance exercise intensity . Ten normotensive professor ( 33.6±3.4 year , 82.4±12.4 kg ; 177.0±7.5 cm ) randomly underwent control resistance exercise initiate daily activity . Resistance exercise consist circuit training last 40min 40 % 80 % one repetition maximum test . Systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure well heart rate variability indicator time frequency domain ( Low Frequency , High Frequency , Low Frequency : High Frequency ratio ) evaluate rest 24 hour session . The average day-time , night-time nocturnal blood pressure fall systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure calculate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental Procedure To test hypothesis present study , evaluation anthropometric characteristic , interview cover medical history habit daily live strength assessment use one maximum repetition test , consist another three distinct experimental session period seven day always time day random order , apply university professor . The intervention experimental session consist resistance exercise intensities 40 % one maximum repetition ( low intensity ) , 80 % one maximum repetition ( high intensity ) control without exercise . Before 24 hour different intervention , emphasis teach sleeping hour university professor , hemodynamic cardiac autonomic response examine . Experimental Sessions The participant tell avoid intake alcohol caffeine 24 hour prior experimental session . In addition , period , participant ask perform moderate vigorous physical activity . The experimental session perform random order separate period seven day , 9 10 . All session perform day professor taught class , occur university 's night period , 7 10 pm . In three experimental session , professor taught class subject . Pre-intervention : Before intervention , individual remain seated laboratory period 20 minute quiet room without interference noise room temperature 22-24ºC . During period , every 5 minute , blood pressure measurement obtain , R-R interval ( elapsed time two consecutive R wave cardiac cycle ) continuously record . The mean blood pressure indicator heart rate variability base R-R interval record consider pre-intervention resting period . Intervention : The resistance exercise intensity define base previous study . These study find low intensity ( 40 % one maximum repetition ) high intensity ( 80 % one maximum repetition ) resistance exercise session promote positive blood pressure responses period subsequent execution normotensive individual . The low intensity high intensity resistance exercise control session last 40 minute . For session resistance exercise , three circuit 7 exercise perform sequence one maximum repetition test . For low intensity high intensity , 16 8 repetition perform exercise , interval 60 90 second exercise , respectively , 120 second circuit . The duration repetition exercise , low intensity high intensity , 3 second - 1 second concentric phase 2 second eccentric phase movement . In control session , participant remain seated comfortable chair environment resistance exercise session . Post-intervention : When intervention period complete , participant allow bathe subsequent installation equipment hemodynamic cardiac autonomic assessment . The blood pressure monitoring perform subsequent 24 hour , every 15 minute day every 30 minute night . The R-R interval record continuously obtain subsequent 24 hour . At end 24 hour period , volunteer return laboratory removal measure equipment . In ambulatory blood pressure monitoring , test consider valid record occur 80 % validity . Hemodynamic Autonomic Evaluation All participant instruct maintain daily eat routine day hemodynamic autonomic evaluation . A Meditech Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring-04 , properly validate , use hemodynamic assessment systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure pre- post-intervention period . A Polar® RS800CX frequency meter ( Electo Oy , Kempele , Finland ) , also demonstrate validity reproducibility , use cardiac autonomic assessment period . The autonomic indicator examine 1 ) linear method time domain absolute mean record R-R interval ; 2 ) method frequency domain spectral analysis Fast Fourier Transform , include low frequency power ( 0.04/0.15 Hz ) normalize unit marker sympathetic activity , high frequency power ( 0.15/0.40 Hz ) normalize unit marker vagal activity , low frequency : high frequency ratio marker sympathetic-vagal balance . All indicator describe European Society Cardiology , analyse perform use software Kubios Heart Rate Variability Analysis version 2.0 ( Biosignal Laboratory , University Kuopio , Finland ) . All variable analyze pre-intervention 24 hour post-intervention . In addition , day time night time period adopt calculate , systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure , mean blood pressure day time ( wakefulness ) night time ( sleep ) hour . The percentage nocturnal blood pressure fall calculate percentage blood pressure reduction night-time compare day time ( night time : day time ratio ) . The morning blood pressure surge correspond morning increase blood pressure calculate accord difference morning pressure ( average blood pressure 2 hour awaken ) low night time blood pressure ( average low blood pressure 2 reading immediately precede low value ) also analyze . Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistic mean standard deviation standard error mean adopt . All variable present absolute variation ( Δ = difference baseline various time session ) . Mathematical procedure calculate percentage blood pressure fall morning blood pressure surge perform . Data normality verify exploratory analysis use Shapiro-Wilk test . Two-way repeated-measures analysis variance apply , report `` F-ratio '' `` p-value '' check main interaction effect time session ( time*session ) time ( time ) . When statistically significant effect find , post-hoc Tukey test adopt multiple comparison , `` p '' value report . Initially , variable low-frequency : high-frequency ratio non-normal distribution ; however , natural logarithmic transformation perform scale adjustment meet normal distribution model . The significance level use study p &lt; 0.05 , software program use BioEstat v. 5.3 Statistica® v. 7.0 .</detailed_description>
