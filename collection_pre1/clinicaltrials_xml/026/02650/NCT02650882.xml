	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) program respiratory muscle strength resistance aerobic physical performance ( PP ) handball athlete . Nineteen male athlete take part study , allocate random experimental group ( EG , n=10 ) placebo group ( PG , n=9 ) , age 19±1 22±5 year old , respectively . The respiratory muscle strength ( RMS ) evaluate measure maximum inspiratory expiratory pressure ( MIP MEP , respectively ) , muscular respiratory resistance evaluate maximum voluntary ventilation ( MVV ) aerobic PP apply cardiopulmonary exercise test . Subsequently volunteer submit IMT protocol 5 time week 12 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design evaluate effect 12-week IMT program respiratory muscle strength aerobic physical performance handball player . Nineteen male athlete take part study , divide experimental group ( EG ) , take part evaluation , maintain regular sporting activity carry IMT ( n=10 ) , placebo group ( PG ) , take part evaluation , maintain regular sporting activity carry IMT load consider placebo ( n=09 ) , Experimental procedure carry trained researcher qualify team . The evaluation IMT carry competitive season , train frequency base competition program , follow traditional annual model . The athlete submit initial evaluation compose measure respiratory muscle strength ( RMS ) use manovacuometer , evaluation aerobic physical performance carry use cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) . The athlete reevaluate 12 week subsequent analysis comparison initial value . All subject previously inform experimental procedure , sign free clarified term consent . The project approve Ethics Research Committee Institution number 62/13 .</detailed_description>
