	<brief_title>Safety Study CD24Fc When Administered Intravenously Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single ascend dose study assess safety , tolerability , PK CD24Fc healthy male female adult subject . The population study healthy male female age 18 55 year , inclusive , body mass index 18 kg/m2 30 kg/m2 , inclusive . A total 40 subject enrol study , 5 cohort 8 subject . Six 8 subject cohort receive study drug 2 subject receive placebo ( 0.9 % sodium chloride , saline ) . The first cohort dose 10 mg . Succeeding cohort receive 30 mg , 60 mg , 120 mg , 240 mg CD24Fc match placebo dose least 3 week apart allow review safety tolerability data prior cohort . Administration next high dose new cohort subject permit adequate safety tolerability demonstrate . In cohort , initial 2 subject 1 study drug recipient 1 placebo recipient Day 1 ( sentinel subject ) . Subjects 3 5 6 8 dosed Day 7 ( minimum 24 hour apart subgroup ) . Each subject dose least 1 hour apart subgroup . If necessary , dose rest subject delay pending review significant safety issue may arise post-dose period involve first second subgroup cohort . The subsequent cohort dose least 3 week prior cohort . The total study duration subject 63 day . Single dose administration occur Day 1 . The Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) occur 21 day prior begin active treatment period . After provide informed consent , subject underwent screening procedure eligibility . Subjects admit Clinical Pharmacology Unit ( CPU ) Day -1 ( Visit 2 ) , randomize treatment period begin Day 1 follow 10-hour minimum overnight fast . Subjects randomly assign treatment CD24Fc placebo single dose . Subjects remain confined morning Day 4 . All subject return CPU Day 7 , Day 14 , Day 21 , Day 28 , Day 42 ( ±1 day ) follow-up visit ( Visit 3 , Visit 4 , Visit 5 , Visit 6 , Visit 7 ) . Visit 7 final visit subject . The assessment safety base primarily frequency adverse event , clinical laboratory assessment ( chemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) , physical examination , vital sign , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , continuous telemetry monitoring . The Intent-to-Treat ( ITT ) Population use summary . PK parameter calculate use actual collection time . The following PK parameter CD24Fc calculate individual plasma concentration profile non compartmental approach . The PK Evaluable Population define subject ITT Population evaluable concentration-time profile CD24Fc . The PK Evaluable Population population use PK analysis . The PK listing , summary , analysis perform base plasma concentration CD24Fc treatment . Pharmacokinetic parameter calculate use actual collection time . The PK parameter CD24Fc ( Cmax , Tmax , kel , t½ , AUC0-42d , AUC0-inf , AUCextr , CL , Vd ) calculate individual plasma concentration profile non-compartmental approach . The concentration CD24Fc summarize descriptively nominal time point treatment ( e.g. , n , mean , standard deviation [ SD ] , coefficient variation [ CV % ] , standard error , median , minimum , maximum ) . Mean concentration ( ±SD ) plot linear scale nominal time point treatment . Geometric mean concentration plot semi-logarithmic scale nominal time point . The PK Evaluable Population use summary individual concentration . Individual concentration-time curve CD24Fc plot linear semi-logarithmic scale actual sampling time subject . Pharmacokinetic parameter summarize PK Evaluable Population . All parameter summarize treatment number observation , mean , SD , CV % , standard error , median , maximum , minimum . Geometric mean geometric CV % also provide summary AUCs Cmax . Dose proportionality CD24Fc plasma PK parameter ( AUCs Cmax ) assess use power model : = DoseB , denote PK parameter analyze depends subject . Dose proportionality implies B = 1 assess estimate β along 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) . The exponent , B , power model estimate regress log-transformed PK parameter log-transformed dose . The power model fit restricted maximum likelihood use SAS Proc Mixed . Both intercept slope fit fixed effect . The mean slope estimate power model correspond 90 % CI calculate . The ITT Population consist subject receive least 1 dose study drug . The ITT Population primary analysis population subject information safety evaluation . The assessment safety base primarily frequency nature adverse event , clinical laboratory assessment ( chemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) , physical examination , vital sign , 12-lead ECGs , telemetry monitoring . The ITT Population use summary . All adverse event summarized system organ class , preferred term , treatment . A list subject serious adverse event ( SAEs ) discontinue study due adverse event provide . The number percentage subject experience least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) present system organ class preferred term treatment . Treatment-emergent adverse event consider Investigator related study drug summarize manner . Serious adverse event adverse event lead discontinuation study list separately . Clinical laboratory evaluation ( chemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) summarize treatment visit . Change baseline also summarize . Vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , temperature ) summarize treatment time point . Change baseline also summarize . All physical examination data list . Electrocardiogram parameter change baseline summarize . Overall interpretation list .</detailed_description>
