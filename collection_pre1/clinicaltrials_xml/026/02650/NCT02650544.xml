	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Analyses Mirtazapine NSCLC Patients With Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression prevail patient malignant tumor incident rate 20 % - 40 % , 2-3 time prevalence population , especially high patient advance solid tumor patient 40 % - 50.6 % . National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) palliative care guideline recommend PHQ-9 diagnosis tool depression , total score ≥ 8 consider standard malignant tumor related depression . Major depression prove related malignant tumor , mirtazapine currently effective drug anti-depression clinical therapy , good tolerance equal effect compare Tricyclic antidepressant ( TCAs ) 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) noradrenaline serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( NE-SNRIs ) . This phase II , placebo-controlled , randomize , double-blinded clinical trial . Study objective ass efficacy safety mirtazapine advance NSCLC patient malignant tumor related depression . Study hypothesis advance NSCLC diagnose depression undertake palliative chemotherapy mirtazapine treatment 8 week remarkable improvement depression compare baseline . Palliative chemotherapy mirtazapine well efficacy , recovery rate , response duration , tolerance quality life improvement palliative chemotherapy placebo . Moreover , mirtazapine could improve patient ' anxiety chemotherapy relate nausea vomit . Eligible advanced NSCLC Patients PHQ-9 score ≥ 8 , undertake palliative chemotherapy enrol study . After baseline assessment ( PHQ-9 , HAMD-17 EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire ) , 236 patient stratify ( gender , age , NRS score cancer pain 0-3/4-6/7-10 ) randomize ( 1:1 ) mirtazapine placebo treatment . Patients mirtazapine arm orally administer mirtazapine 15mg , QD , consecutive medication 8 week ; along palliative chemotherapy regimen decide investigator . Patients placebo arm orally administer placebo 15mg , QD , consecutive medication 8 week ; along palliative chemotherapy regimen decide investigator . During treatment , PHQ-9 , HAMD-17 EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire collect 3 week ( d22 ) 8 week ( d57 ) , treatment discontinuation date due depression deteriorate suicidal tendency behavior . Follow-up last 4 week treatment end depression assessment ( questionnaires every 2 week ) . If anti-depression therapy effective 8 week treatment treatment discontinuation , patient unblinded receive treatment accord investigator . Treatment end 8 week . Study endpoint : primary endpoint anti-depression efficacy ( response rate ) . Response define PHQ-9 HAMD-17 questionnaire score decrease ≥ 50 % compare baseline level . Secondary endpoint include : 1.recovery rate , recovery define PHQ-9 score less 8 point . 2 . Response duration , defined time period treatment response regression recurrence ( PHQ-9 score ascend baseline level ) . 3 . Quality life improvement , define best quality life score minus baseline level . 4 . Compliance anti-depression therapy , define medication count follow-up time point .</detailed_description>
