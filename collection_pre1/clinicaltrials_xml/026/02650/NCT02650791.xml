	<brief_title>Platelet Transfusion Requirements Hematopoietic Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Canada , 1,500 autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) perform annually hematologic malignancy . It currently standard practice provide prophylactic transfusion platelet prevent bleed daily measure platelet count le 10 x 109/L . A patient may require six adult platelet dose post-transplant period . However , true benefit prophylactic platelet transfusion ASCT set unclear call question several recent study . Prophylactic platelet transfusion may unnecessary , may detrimental patient . Among blood product , platelet transfusion associate high risk infectious non-infectious complication : would include bacterial infection allergic /febrile reaction . Moreover , potential overuse platelet product place significant burden scarce health care resource provide volunteer donation . An alternative strategy prevent bleed reduce need platelet transfusion involve administer Tranexamic Acid , oral antifibrinolytic agent stabilize blood clot reduce bleed . Tranexamic Acid safe effective many clinical scenario , may reasonable alternative prophylactic platelet transfusion . In set ASCT , Tranexamic Acid may reduce bleed enhance strategy therapeutic platelet transfusion platelet administer event active bleeding symptom . The effect prophylactic platelet transfusion Tranexamic Acid clinical , quality life economic outcome patient receive ASCT unknown . The primary aim research program perform randomize control trial determine whether strategy prophylactic Tranexamic Acid ( therapeutic platelet transfusion ) safe effective compare prophylactic platelet transfusion patient undergo ASCT . Before conduct large trial , investigator first propose pilot randomize control trial determine feasibility study .</detailed_description>
