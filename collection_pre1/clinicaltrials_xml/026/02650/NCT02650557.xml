	<detailed_description>Coronary slow flow ( CSF ) phenomenon , characterize delayed coronary opacification absence obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease , relatively common find patient undergoing routine coronary angiography often associate chest pain . In patient CSF , blood flow may heterogeneously distribute three coronary artery , suggest heterogeneously distribute microvascular dysfunction myocardium . However , vessel heterogeneity Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) frame count ( TFC ) fully elucidate . P-wave dispersion ( PWD ) define difference long short P-wave duration record multiple different surface electrocardiogram ( ECG ) lead , report associate inhomogeneous discontinuous propagation sinus impulses5 , well know electrophysiologic characteristic atrium prone fibrillation . Although plausible hypothesize PWD might associate heterogeneously distribute microvascular dysfunction , previous study demonstrate abnormal PWD patient CSF , correlation TFC heterogeneity PWD never evaluate . In study , investigator aim investigate vessel heterogeneity TFC three coronary artery , relation PWD , patient CSF otherwise normal coronary artery .</detailed_description>
