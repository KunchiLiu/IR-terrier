	<brief_summary>This phase I/IIa trial study side effect best dose gene-modified T cell see effective treat patient solid tumor express cancer-testis antigen 1 ( NY-ESO-1 ) gene spread start nearby tissue lymph node ( locally advance ) spread place body ( metastatic ) . A T cell type immune cell recognize kill abnormal cell body . Placing modified gene NY-ESO-1 patient ' T cell laboratory give back patient may help body build immune response kill tumor cell express NY-ESO-1 . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spreading , may also allow genetically modify T cell grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene-Modified T Cells Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Stage IV Solid Tumors Expressing NY-ES0-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety feasibility adoptive transfer autologous NY-ESO-1 T cell receptor ( TCR ) ( NY-ESO-1 reactive TCR retroviral vector transduce autologous PBL ) /dominant-negative transform growth factor-beta receptor II ( dnTGFbetaRII ) ( TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte [ TILs ] ) transgenic T cell . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. NY-ESO-1 TCR/ dnTGFÎ²RII transgenic T cell persistence analyze serial peripheral blood sample presence T cell NY-ESO-1 TCR tetramer analysis . II . To study T cell differentiation correlate high anti-tumor response . III . To test hypothesis NY-ESO-1 TCR/dnTGFbetaRII constitute cell efficient induce tumor regression . IV . Determine objective tumor response Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study NY-ESO-1 TCR/TGFbDNRII-transduced TILs follow phase II study . Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day -5 -4 . Patients receive NY-ESO-1 reactive TCR retroviral vector transduce autologous PBL TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous TILs infusion day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 1-4 , 8 12 , 6 9 month , every 6 month 5 year , yearly 9 year .</detailed_description>
