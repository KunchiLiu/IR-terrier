	<brief_title>BPM31510 Administered Intravenously With Without Gemcitabine Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 multicenter , open-label , non-randomized study examine safety effectiveness BPM31510 administer 144-hour continuous intravenous ( IV ) infusion monotherapy combination gemcitabine advance pancreatic cancer patient 2nd / 3rd line therapy . This study occur two part . Part 1 study enroll ten ( 10 ) patient BPM31510 ( monotherapy arm ) enroll ten ( 10 ) patient BPM31510 plus gemcitabine ( combination therapy arm ) . If least one ten patient treat ( either arm ) experience Complete Response ( CR ) Partial Response ( PR ) , base RECIST 1.1 criterion , 2 cycle treatment , Part 2 study enroll additional 15 patient total 25 patient arm ( ) show response . In absence least one CR PR , least 3 patient experience stable disease either treatment arm Sponsor choose enroll additional 15 patient applicable treatment arm ( ) expansion stage . BPM31510 Nanosuspension Injection ( 40 mg/mL ) administer IV 144 hour . Each patient receive 2 consecutive 72-hour infusion per week ( Tuesday-Friday Friday-Monday ) . Patients enrol monotherapy arm receive BPM31510 dose 171 mg/Kg . The dose BPM31510 combination arm 110 mg/Kg . Patients enrolled combination therapy arm also treat gemcitabine IV weekly ( start week 3 ) start dose 1000 mg/m2 . Cycle 1 therapy either 6 week duration patient BPM31510 administer twice weekly Tuesdays Fridays 6 week ( monotherapy ) 6 week duration patient BPM31510 administer twice weekly Tuesdays Fridays 6 week plus gemcitabine administer Mondays , Days 21 , 28 35 ( combination therapy ) . Cycles 2-12 4 week duration BPM31510 administer twice weekly Tuesdays Fridays 4 week ( monotherapy ) 4 week duration BPM31510 administer twice weekly Tuesdays Fridays 4 week plus gemcitabine administer Mondays , Days 7 , 14 21 ( combination therapy ) . Response assess Cycle 2 ( 10 week ) patient continue onto Cycles 2-12 assess every 2 cycle ( 8 week ) . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE v4.02 ) . Assessments antitumor activity combination perform end Cycle 2 every 2 cycle thereafter use standard technique computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) patient measurable disease . Response evaluate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 . Patients experience unacceptable toxicity disease progression , may receive additional 28-day cycle 1 year . Patients continue BPM31510 alone , combination gemcitabine , maximum 12 cycle absence intolerable toxicity progression . If gemcitabine combination therapy arm discontinue due chemotherapy-related toxicity , patient may continue receive BPM31510 monotherapy .</detailed_description>
