	<brief_summary>In emergency department ( ED ) , ketamine popular anesthetic agent sedation child painful short procedure . Sedation procedure commonly use child adult , achieve motion control cooperation . In child , ketamine offer ideal choice due fact short acting , highly effective sedative , preserve cardio-respiratory stability . In United States , one million child per year four year age undergo short procedure require anesthestic agent , include ketamine . However , mount concern animal study retrospective human research regard safety ketamine administer infant young child respect potential toxic effect develop . Conversely , ketamine also suggest neuroprotective agent . Prompt investigation resolution issue urgently require .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Anesthetic Ketamine Young Children Undergoing Procedural Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study : Primary Objective : In otherwise healthy child 3 48 month age present tertiary care emergency department receive procedural sedation ketamine , determine least 50 % increase , compare baseline serum concentration neurotoxicity biomarkers S100B , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) neuronal-specific enolase ( NSE ) , 1 3 hour intravenous ketamine administration . The cut-off 50 % benchmark value routinely quote animal human study , correlate neurotoxicity biomarker level functional outcome . Secondary Objectives : In aforementioned population : 1 . To determine least 50 % increase serum concentration S100B , GFAP NSE compare baseline 6 12 hour intravenous ketamine administration . 2 . To explore genotype relevant ketamine metabolism disposition associate increased vulnerability neurotoxic effect ketamine . 3 . To determine toxic effect ketamine administration cellular level ( evidence sustainable cellular damage mitochondrial DNA change ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All child age 3 48 month receive intravenous ketamine procedural sedation ED study enrolment hour eligible recruitment . 1 . Children contraindications procedural sedation ED accord SickKids ( Hospital Sick Children ) practice guideline ketamine administration consider . 2 . Parents insurmountable language barrier ( i.e . speak English accompany another adult translate parent/caregiver ) , prevents inform consent . 3 . Child receive procedural sedation/ surgery general anesthesia past 30 day . 4 . A child received central nervous system drug ( e.g . anticonvulsant , benzodiazepine ) know neurotoxic drug ( e.g. , methotrexate , corticosteroid ) concomitantly 30 day precede sedation . 5 . A child suffer traumatic head injury concomitantly previous 30 day 6 . A child CNS ( Central Nervous System ) illnesses pathology ( e.g. , meningitis , near drowning , hypoxicischemic brain injury , seizure disorder ) 30 day prior sedation , potentially lead elevate baseline serum biomarkers . 7 . A child whose parent consider emotional distress due injury illness child attend ED physician attend ED physician believe appropriate ask parent consent .</criteria>
