	<detailed_description>Discovery genetic basis impair metabolism greatly advanced treatment patient know metabolic disease . However , many genetic metabolic disorder molecular cause remain discovered . The overall goal study discover new disease-associated gene child , establish specific focus metabolic disorder molecular characterization likely lead novel therapy . The primary objective identify novel pathogenic mutation child rare Mendelian disorder . The secondary objective : 1 ) Optimize methodology metabolomic sample collection , process analysis ; 2 ) Establish normative range large number ( potentially 1000 ) metabolites healthy newborn old child . Approximately one three admission tertiary care pediatric hospital result condition genetic basis . Although majority condition rare , collectively account disproportionate amount illness death child . Discovery genetic basis rare condition often uncover pathophysiological basis common disease . This particularly true genetic disease impaired metabolism ( inborn error metabolism , IEMs ) . There many genetic metabolic disorder yet discover . Of approximately 20,000 known human gene , less one-fifth currently associate disease phenotype . IEMs particular area focus u two major reason . First , several hundred know IEMs , many already effectively treat dietary modification and/or medical therapy . This indicate u discovery new IEM gene great potential produce clinically actionable insight pathophysiology therapeutic opportunity , ultimately lead treatment child would otherwise impossible treat . Second , PI study , Dr. Ralph DeBerardinis , expert metabolomics , practice identify quantify metabolite biological system . We therefore implement research-based metabolomic profiling evaluation patient suspect IEMs genetic disease . This detailed analysis substantially increase likelihood identify clinically relevant metabolic perturbation child growth failure , acidosis , hypoglycemia , hyperammonemia , abnormality putative genetic origin . It would also enable u interpret mutation uncover clinical research-based genomic sequencing . We believe establish systematic procedure evaluate metabolome genome sick child produce new insight genetic basis pediatric disease , ultimately new way treat condition . In study , subject recruit two population : control diseased . In control population , plasma sample healthy newborn acquire time blood collection state-mandated newborn screening Parkland . We also collect blood healthy child clinic Children 's Medical Center ( CMC ) , piggyback research sample venipuncture clinically indicate blood collection . All plasma sample subject metabolomics determine healthy range large number metabolite . This comprehensive profile metabolite child use normative range identify outlying metabolite diseased subject . Additionally , suspect metabolic outlier detect normal population , DNA sample extract leftover packed cell blood sample subject genomic sequencing profile associate gene mutation . The diseased population recruit clinic Pediatric Genetics Metabolism Division Department Pediatrics/CMC . Blood DNA sample collect patient metabolomic analysis next-generation sequence respectively define metabolic abnormality associate gene mutation . Skin fibroblasts patient also collect used biological validation metabolic effect novel mutation , particular complementing diseased fibroblast wild-type allele gene mutate patient . If rare Mendelian disorder consider subject , blood his/her family member acquire subjected metabolomic genomic analysis facilitate identification diseased-associated gene .</detailed_description>
