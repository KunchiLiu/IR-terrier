	<brief_summary>This single center , single arm , open-label pilot study determine feasibility safety single dose administer spilt fraction autologous T cell express CD22 chimeric antigen receptor express tandem TCRζ 4-1BB ( TCRζ/4-1BB ) co-stimulatory domain ( refer `` CART22 '' cell ) pediatric patient relapse refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist three sequential phase : 1 ) screening phase , 2 ) manufacture pre- treatment phase , consist apheresis ( applicable ) chemotherapy ( applicable ) , 3 ) treatment phase , consist CART22 transfuse cell infusion follow evaluation . After sign informed consent , patient undergo screen test procedure determine eligibility . Once patient eligibility confirm , patient cell collect leukapheresis obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) CART22 manufacturing , unless adequate number cell available prior apheresis . Cells transduce anti-CD22 TCRζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector , expand vitro frozen future administration . Cryopreserved historical apheresis product collect patient prior study entry usable CART22 manufacturing collect appropriately certified apheresis center product meet adequate mononuclear cell yield . If historical apheresis product available , apheresis procedure schedule cell procurement study entry . Unless contraindicate medically advisable base previous chemotherapy , patient give condition chemotherapy prior CART22 cell infusion intent lymphodepletion . Additionally , patient 's white blood cell ( WBC ) count ≤ 1,000 /uL , conditioning/lymphodepleting chemotherapy NOT require . The chemotherapy plan last dose complete 1-4 day BEFORE planned infusion CART22 cell . The chemotherapy start date vary base duration select chemotherapy regimen . If period chemotherapy CART22 infusion delay 4 week , patient need re-treated lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior CART22 infusion . We enroll 15 evaluable patient primary safety endpoint analysis . Primary safety evaluable patient receive CART22 cell . The first three subject infuse CART22 stagger 14 day allow monitor adverse event , include CRS . Subjects manufacture cell dose less protocol-specified dose score manufacturing failure . These subject receive cell infusion , provide manufacturing release criterion meet . All patient blood test assess CART22 safety , engraftment persistence regular interval throughout study ( Visit Evaluation Schedule Appendix 1 ) . Circulating CART22 T cell subset assess various time infusion . CART22 traffic assess bone marrow aspirate , tissue , available . Follow plan minimum weekly 4 week , monthly 6 month , patient follow quarterly remainder year obtain medical history , undergo physical examination , blood test . Additional sample collection assessment schedule visit CART22 cell infusion perform clinically indicate . Following evaluation , patient enter roll-over study long term follow-up additional fourteen year assess safety assessment per FDA guideline .</detailed_description>
