	<detailed_description>Aortic stenosis ( AS ) common valve disease among adult population , majority case require treatment advanced age . Surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) often refuse advanced age poor general condition . These patient use receive medical treatment less favorable compare SAVR . Nowadays transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) become available alternative treatment high risk even inoperable patient suffer symptomatic aortic stenosis ( 1 ) . Between 2012 2014 TAVI use extensively , accumulate 100,000 procedure perform worldwide since 2002 ( 2 ) . TAVI originally develop patient consider frail undergo SAVR ( 3 ) . Recently , able perform TAVI almost patient high procedure success rate achieve good hemodynamic result . Despite promising result , one year outcome evident . Until learnt group patient bad condition frail benefit TAVI . These patient bad survival rate importantly poor quality life spite successful procedure . Cardiac surgery risk score like Society Thoracic surgery score ( STS ) EUROSCORE less accurate age high risk people ( 4 ) . Advanced age often accompany frail general condition , estimate morbidity mortality value correlate well postoperative outcome . In risk score important relevant factor like frailty disability take account . In elderly principal make differentiation utility futility . Frailty clinical syndrome reflect impaired physiologic reserve increase vulnerability stressor ( 5 ) . However frailty geriatric concept exist long time , importance recently gain high priority concept old adult especially undergo TAVI ( 1 ) . By today frailty score increase importance use frequently several investigator . Slow 5m gait speed evidently prove unfavorable outcome ( 6 , 7 ) , frailty assessment tool like handgrip strength test , activity daily live ( ADL ) , instrumental activity daily live ( iADL ) , nutritional assessment , mini-mental status , etc . investigate continuously . On hand , beside frailty status main barrier TAVI risk neurological impairment . The TAVI candidate patient specific central nervous system ( CNS ) issue neurobiological change age , e.g . decrease brain weight volume , decrease neurotransmitter system function , decrease neuronal gene expression Alzheimer type change ( 8 ) . Neurological injury impairment TAVI occur cerebrovascular event ( CVE ) and/or neurocognitive dysfunction . Both form might clinically apparent detect , clinically apparent undetected clinically silent undetected . The two neurocognitive dysfunction - post-operative delirium ( POD ) post-operative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) - case remain undetected although clinically could apparent silent ( 9 ) . POD define Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM-5 ) . POCD define Kappetein et al. , `` deterioration intellectual function presenting impaired memory concentration present temporal association surgery '' ( 9 , 10 ) . The neurological injury observe and/or detect neuroimaging technique cognitive trajectory . Some insult cause TAVI might remain clinically silent area might observe slight neurocognitive dysfunction . Analization incidence underlie etiology neurological event may lead identification recently non-recognized technique neuroprotective strategy , device . The elevated incidence CVEs within 24 hour TAVI . This risk event might high two month ( 11 ) . One fifth health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) characterize cognitive function . Studies report cognitive , psychiatric , and/or neurological event follow TAVI focus major well-marked complication , e.g. , stroke , TIA , post-operative delirium ( 12 ) . Meantime TAVI associate high incidence ( 73 % -84 % ) silent cerebral embolism detect diffusion-weighted MRI ( 13 ) . Chronological age always reflect biological age wide range fit frail ( 14 ) . A well establish validate frailty score base relatively simple feasible test could help everyday practice evaluate prognosis elderly people undergo TAVI determine patient really benefit procedure . Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction ( POCD ) patient undergo TAVI ( and/or SAVR ) examine study publish last 10 year . Examinations investigation finer , long-term possibly positive post-operative cognitive outcome follow TAVI ( SAVR ) significantly under-represented current medical literature ( 15 ) . Hypothesis : There significant correlation Hungarian Frailty Score ( HFS ) post procedure outcomes quality life preservation . HFS score would useful tool estimate benefit TAVI . We also hypothesize cognitive performance preserve , improve end 12th month TAVI due well cerebral circulation . Objectives aim 1 . Generate validate new risk score system call Hungarian Frailty Score ( HFS ) , represent objective tool evaluation frailty syndrome patient undergo TAVI procedure . 2 . To determine change prove cognitive decline patient undergoing TAVI ( pre post TAVI cognitive function assess ) . Primary aim : To estimate correlation HFS , in-hospital stay , 30 day 1-year outcomes evaluate accord VARC 2 Criteria . The benefit study conclude exact data quality life provide comprehensive investigation pre- post-TAVI cognitive outcome . We plan define apart incidence possible neurological sign radiological evidence neurogical injury POCD , decline long term cognitive function improvement long term quality life ( QoL ) . Secondary aim : Find correlation difference HFS , QoL , eyeball test , cognitive outcome . Additional impact ass whether POD POCD part condition , spectrum , prevent . Expected result : To generate simple useable risk score system adopt Hungarian population evaluate patient undergo TAVI collect data post TAVI QoL cognitive function , register change pre post procedure frailty score . Non-diagnosed preoperative cognitive impairment CVEs patient detect baseline .</detailed_description>
