	<brief_summary>This study interventional prospective observatory single center trial , investigate supraspinal effect long term conventional SCS ( 60 Hz ) paresthesia-free high density SCS fail back surgery syndrome ( FBSS ) patient back leg pain complete rest state functional magnetic resonance ( rs fMRI ) voxel-based magnetic resonance morphometry ( VBM ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>When patient meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion , neuroimaging protocol obtain baseline , prior trial implantation SCS . At trial implantation Vectris® SureScan® MRI 1x8 lead implant , target intraoperative mapping . This lead connect temporary extension cable ENS . Normal trial period respect base reimbursement rule Belgium ( 4 week ) . When patient eligible implantation definitive SCS system ( 50 % pain reduction and/or 50 % reduction pain medication ) , patient undergo surgery definitive implantation . Then Vectris® SureScan® MRI lead connect RestoreSensor® SureScan® MRI neurostimulator . After stabilisation stimulation parameter least 1 month , second session neuroimaging occur ( T1 ) RestoreSensor® SureScan® MRI neurostimulator MRI mode . Minimal one month later ( 2 month implantation definitive SCS system ) patient undergo last session neuroimaging ( T2 ) stimulator MRI mode . During period prior MR-session , new protocol occur paresthesia free high density SCS . The MRI protocol occur stabilisation stimulation parameter least 1 month . During whole period , patient fill VAS diary ( back leg pain separately ) time neuroimaging T1 T2 Likert-scale order evaluate satisfaction grade patient . Additionally , patient also wear whole period Actiwatch , measure sleep pattern fill questionnaire B , T1 T2 ( Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) Holland Sleep Disorders Questionnaire ( HSDQ ) .</detailed_description>
