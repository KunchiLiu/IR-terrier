	<criteria>1 . The patient suitable candidate Bicompartmental Knee Replacement moderate severe patellofemoral wear medial compartment wear ( surgeon discretion ) 2 . The patient fix flexion great 10 degree . 3 . The patient maximal flexion great 100 degree 4 . The patient passively correctable varus deformity 5 . The patient functionally Intact Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL . ) 6 . The patient significant patellofemoral malalignment 7 . The patient negligible lateral compartment degeneration appreciable loss cartilage height ( surgeon 's discretion ) . 8 . The patient pain localise medial compartment 9 . The patient male nonpregnant female . 10 . The patient sign study specific , Human Research Ethics Committee ( HREC ) approve Informed Consent document willing able comply specify preoperative postoperative clinical radiographic evaluation 1 . The patient clinically deficient ACL cruciate collateral ligament insufficiency CT arthrogram . 2 . The patient undergo revision surgery 3 . The patient great 10° hyperextension , great 10° varus valgus deformity , great 10° Flexion Contracture 4 . The patient active , local infection previous intraarticular infection 5 . The patient skeletal immaturity 6 . The patient without sufficient bone stock allow appropriate insertion fixation prosthesis 7 . The patient 's weight , age activity level might cause extreme load early failure system ( surgeon discretion ) . 8 . The patient systemic local condition would limit ability assess performance device e.g . neuromuscular neurosensory deficiency , disorder lead progressive bone deterioration ( include rheumatoid arthritis osteoporosis ) , patient immunologically suppress . 9 . Patient cognitive impairment , intellectual disability mental illness consider investigator inhibit patient 's capacity consent research ability participate 10 .
