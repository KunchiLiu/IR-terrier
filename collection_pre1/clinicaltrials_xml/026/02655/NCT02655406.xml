	<brief_summary>This study look effect compression therapy patient endovenous treatment varicose vein use foam sclerotherapy . Patients randomise either compression group ( group A ) compression group ( group B ) . The pain score , compliance , quality life score , occlusion rate 6 month well cost effectiveness intervention assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomise clinical trial look impact wear wear compression stock follow endovenous ablation use foam sclerotherapy . Patients randomise group A ( compression ) group B ( compression ) . Target Population Patients refer Imperial College NHS Trust treatment symptomatic varicose vein recruit find varicose vein suitable foam sclerotherapy colour duplex scan . Intervention Patients randomise compression ( group A ) compression ( group B ) . This do use online randomisation software ( Sealed Envelope Ltd ) . The compression therapy use Class II compression stocking . The treatment offer foam sclerotherapy varicose vein use either Polidocanol Sodium Tetradecyl Sulphate ( STS ) concentration use left discretion clinician . Patients randomise group A ask wear compression stocking 1 week . Patients randomise group B provide bandage wear 24 hour , compression afterwards . At baseline , patient ask fill validate quality life questionnaire ( EQ-5D , AVVQ CIVIQ ) clinical score assess use validate score system ( CEAP VCSS ) . On discharge varicose vein intervention , provide diary record post-procedural pain every day 10 day use validated visual analogue scale ( VAS ) well record return normal activity back work . They also ask attend follow-up 2 week 6 month . Patients ' GP also send letter inform patient 's participation study . Follow-up Patients follow outpatient clinic 2 week 6 month . Follow-up 2 Weeks At 2 week ' follow-up , diary containing detail pain score soon patient able return normal activities/work collect . In addition , patient ask phlebitis two week procedure compliant compression . They examine Venous Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS ) record . They also ask fill EQ-5D , AVVQ CIVIQ score . Follow-up 6 Months At 6 month follow-up , patient examine VCSS record . They also ask fill EQ-5D , AVVQ CIVIQ score . They venous Duplex scan determine occlusion treat vein . Sample Size Study Duration The investigator estimate sample size need observe difference least 10mm VAS score , standard deviation 20mm . With power 90 % 5 % significance equivalence , 172 patient ( 86 per group ) would need recruit . Previous study look compression stocking show drop rate close 37 % 3 month . Therefore , drop rate 50 % 6 month estimate , least 344 patient would need recruit . If 7 patient recruit per week , total 364 patient could potentially randomise year . With 6 month follow-up , therefore , study run 18 month target recruitment 350 patient .</detailed_description>
