	<brief_summary>Injury muscle back passage ( anal canal ) relatively common problem . This injury result problem bowel control later life usually occur vaginal childbirth ( commonly refer 3rd 4th degree perineal tear ) . Currently woman sustain injury muscle back passage undergo ultrasound scan insert probe 3 4 cm back passage . This help check muscle back passage heal i.e intact defect . The investigator would like establish whether 3D ultrasound scan probe place outside vagina identify defect hence avoid insert probe back passage . In addition get information use 3D ultrasound scan , investigator would also like identify injury pelvic floor muscle ( levator ani ) patient . Which diagnose use 3D ultrasound probe place outside vagina ( perineum ) . Women sustain injury muscle know develop prolapse later life .</brief_summary>
