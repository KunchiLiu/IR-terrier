	<brief_summary>Alcoholic hepatitis syndrome progressive inflammatory liver injury associate long-term heavy intake ethanol . The pathogenesis completely understood . Patients severely affect present subacute onset fever , hepatomegaly , leukocytosis , mark impairment liver function ( e.g. , jaundice , coagulopathy ) , manifestation portal hypertension ( e.g. , ascites , hepatic encephalopathy , variceal hemorrhage ) . However , mild form alcoholic hepatitis often cause symptom . Alcoholic hepatitis usually persist progress cirrhosis heavy alcohol use continue . If alcohol use cease , alcoholic hepatitis resolve slowly week month , sometimes without permanent sequela often residual cirrhosis . F-652 recombinant fusion protein contain human interleukin 22 ( IL-22 ) human Immunoglobulin G2 ( IgG2 ) -Fc produce CHO cell serum-free culture . F-652 development intend treat patient graft vs host disease ( GvHD ) bone marrow transplantation , acute alcoholic hepatitis ( AAH ) , severe form alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) . Both GvHD AAH diseases unmet medical need . The current investigational new drug ( IND ) application conduct phase Ia clinical study GvHD patient evaluate safety pharmacokinetic profile , biomarkers F-652 treatment intravenous infusion ( IV ) . IL-22 member IL-10 family cytokine control bacterial infection , homeostasis , tissue repair . IL-22 may use treat patient ALD antioxidant , anti-apoptotic , anti-steatotic , anti-microbial , proliferative effect demonstrate various experimental system .</brief_summary>
