	<brief_summary>This Phase 1/2 study newly diagnose patient high grade glioma ( HGG ) undergo standard radiation therapy temozolomide treatment . BMX-001 add radiation therapy temozolomide potential benefit survival high grade glioma patient also protect deterioration cognition impairment quality life . In Phase 1 safety tolerability BMX-001 assess use two-stage Continual Reassessment Method ( CRM ) . BMX-001 give subcutaneously first load dose zero four day prior start chemoradiation follow twice week dos one-half load dose duration radiation therapy plus two week . In Phase 2 safety efficacy BMX-001 evaluate . Impact cognition also assess . Twenty-four patient randomize treatment arm receive BMX-001 undergoing chemoradiation 24 patient randomized receive chemoradiation alone . The investigator hypothesize BMX-001 add standard radiation therapy temozolomide safe pharmacologically relevant dos patient newly diagnose high grade glioma . The investigator also hypothesize Phase 2 study , addition BMX-001 positively impact overall survival improve objective measure cognition newly diagnose high grade glioma patient .</brief_summary>
