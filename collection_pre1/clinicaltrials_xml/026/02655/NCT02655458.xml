	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore combination Elotuzumab combination autologous stem cell transplantation lenalidomide maintenance see side effect may well work treatment symptomatic multiple myeloma diagnose treated induction therapy past year . Induction therapy first phase treatment multiple myeloma . The goal induction therapy multiple myeloma reduce number plasma cell bone marrow proteins plasma cell produce . Induction therapy usually give 3-4 week . An autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant procedure immature `` stem cell '' collect store future use . A high dose chemotherapy give patient destroy myeloma cell , patient 's stem cell replace . The investigational drug program elotuzumab . Elotuzumab known BMS-901608 . Elotuzumab manufacture protein direct target find multiple myeloma cell . Lenalidomide currently approve patient multiple myeloma . Melphalan cyclophosphamide , drug use stem cell collection transplant , also approve U.S. FDA . Melphalan FDA-approved chemotherapy multiple myeloma use high-dose treatment prior stem cell transplantation . Cyclophosphamide FDA-approved chemotherapy may use , either alone , combination drug treat multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Elotuzumab Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation ( ASCT ) Lenalidomide Maintenance Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b , open-label , trial investigate elotuzumab autologous PBMC reconstitution auto-SCT consolidation therapy lenalidomide maintenance . Fifteen patient enrol study . This study base hypothesis addition Elotuzumab autologous PBMC reconstitution standard-of-care auto-SCT lenalidomide maintenance safe feasible . Furthermore , hypothesize Elotuzumab PBMC reconstitution target residual myeloma cell , enhance NK cell activation ADCC , promote tumor-specific humoral cellular immune response myeloma cell , result long-term maintenance minimal residual disease state .</detailed_description>
