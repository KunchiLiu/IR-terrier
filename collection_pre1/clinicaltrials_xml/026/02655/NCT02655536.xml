	<detailed_description>This open-label , randomize , multicenter phase II study conduct 3 medical center Asia . Patients receive erlotinib combination bevacizumab erlotinib alone . This study enroll EGFR-mutant NSCLC patient asymptomatic brain metastasis . The primary objective compare systemic progression-free survival ( PFS ) bevacizumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib alone patient EGFR mutant NSCLC asymptomatic brain metastasis . Patients randomize , 1:1 ratio , bevacizumab plus erlotinib group erlotinib alone group . Compute tomography ( CT ) MRI scan perform every 6 week first 12 month since start investigational drug , perform every 12 week . Patients follow documented progression brain and/or extra-cranial lesion . Patients intracranial progression allow continue investigational drug second progression either intracranial progression extracranial progression , develop , time-to extracranial progression determine . In patient EGFR mutant advance NSCLC brain metastasis , report PFS erlotinib gefitinib 6.6 month ( Park et al. , 2012 ) . In current study , assume median PFS , intracranial extracranial include , 7 month erlotinib group alone 12.3 month bevacizumab plus erlotinib group ( hazard ratio 0.57 ) ( Seto et al. , 2014 ) . 109 patient require analysis randomize phase II study . Patients stratify accord EGFR L858R mutation EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation .</detailed_description>
