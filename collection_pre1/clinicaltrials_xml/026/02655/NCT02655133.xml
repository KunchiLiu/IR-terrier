	<brief_title>Effects Microcirculation IgGAM Severe Septic/Septic Shock Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis complex set sign symptom cause Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) infection . Sepsis-related mortality directly proportional severity organ dysfunction , 80 % case septic shock . Due pro-inflammatory response insult , tissue damage far away primary site infection . Concurrently pro-inflammatory cytokine , immune system produce anti-inflammatory mediator IL-10 , exert compensatory antagonist response . The imbalance toward anti-inflammatory one conduce `` immuno-paralysis '' undermines defense organism infection . Antibodies play crucial role fight infection ; low level protective antibody directly relate bad outcome . In consideration , polyvalent immunoglobulin ( Ig ) represent potential therapeutic support modulation immune response inflammation sepsis septic shock . They contain broad spectrum antibody direct wide variety bacterial antigen ( three class normally find human plasma - IgG IgM IgGAM conjugate ) . In addition antibody activity antigen neutralization , benefit Ig may include : inactivation bacterial toxin ( endotoxin exotoxins ) ; increase clearance lipopolysaccharide ; stimulation leukocytes bactericidal activity mechanism opsonization ; reduction activity classical pathway complement ; modulation cytokine production blood mononuclear cell ; synergistic activity antibiotic . Meta-analysis main study produce far show Ig support , particular IgM-enriched one , associate improved survival patient severe sepsis ; promising result quality study n't allow yet strong evidence favour use . The IgM-enriched immunoglobulin ( IgGAM ) prove effective currently formulary usable case severe infection ( Pentaglobin ® ) . However , commonly prescribe , n't guideline determine use . Unpublished clinical data suggest beneficial effect even microvascular level application method near infrared spectroscopy vascular occlusion test level tenar eminence hand . Microcirculatory dysfunction ( endothelial damage glycocalyx , increase permeability tissue edema , leukocyte adhesion , pro-coagulating agent , reduction deformability red blood cell ) crucial aspect pathogenesis sepsis-induced organ dysfunction , result hypoperfusion tissue hypoxia . Persistent microvascular perfusion abnormality associate unfavorable outcome patient septic shock . In consideration , therapy prove act microcirculation restore tissue perfusion would represent promise pathophysiological approach patient septic shock . Material Methods This double blind phase II prospective randomise control trial . It include patient admit Intensive Care Unit University Hospital `` Ospedali Riuniti '' Ancona , 24 hour development severe sepsis septic shock ( diagnosis accord criterion establish Consensus Conference 2001 ) . Patients young 18 year old , pregnant woman , patient severe sepsis/septic shock 24 hour , chronic renal failure , terminal state life expectancy le 24 hour , contraindication treatment IgGAM , lack informed consent exclude . When inclusion criterion present n't exclusion criterion trial write informed consent take patient . Demographic clinical data collect investigator ( age , weight , sex , acute chronic disease present inclusion , GCS , APACHE II , SAPS II , arterial blood gas , SOFA score , lab data Hb , WBC , hepatic renal function , blood sugar , Procalcitonin ) Patients randomize two group ( treaty control ) : patient Group treaty submit infusion IgGAM conjugate ( Pentaglobin ® ) dosage 250 mg/kg IV ( 5 mL/kg ) per day ( rate 0.4 mL/kg/h ) , 72 hour . The control receive equal amount physiological NaCl solution ( 0.9 % ) placebo . Neither patient staff nurse MD aware group treatment apply ( double blind trial ) . IgGAM solution NaCl 0.9 % provide hospital pharmacy similar bag . All patient two group receive optimal therapy condition , accord good medical clinical practice ( GMP ) , appropriate antibiotic therapy , vasoactive infusional therapy.All treatment except Pentaglobin/placebo change discretion doctor 's charge patient.At time inclusion , follow data collect : gender , age , anthropometric parameter , ICU admission diagnosis , know suspected infection , result microbiological test . Prior initiate therapy ( T0 ) , 24 hour ( T24 ) end therapy IgGAM conjugate sublingual microcirculation evaluate `` Incident Dark Field Imaging ( Medical imaging , Cytocam , IDF Braedius , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) tissue oxygenation use `` Near Infrared Spectroscopy technique `` ( NIRS , InSpectra ™ Model 650 ; Hutchinson Technology Inc. , Hutchinson , MN , USA ) . Both technique commonly use clinical practice include CE mark . At time point temperature hemodynamic parameter ( mean arterial pressure heart rate ; cardiac index , global end-diastolic volume , extravascular Lung water monitor ) collect , together arterial venous blood gas lab data , diuresis water balance , GCS . Concomitant treatment note . Data regard duration hospital stay intensive care outcome record . The sample size assessed basis primary objective study , base significantly high PVD Group patient treat IgGAM compare control 72 hour start treatment . Assuming average difference two group 72hrs 4 mm/mm2 SD 3 , nine patient per group would sufficient α error 0.05 power 80 % . In total 20 patient include ( 10 per group All data collect anonymously , attribute select patient alpha-numeric code , electronic database ( password protect ) , respect privacy confidentiality data .</detailed_description>
