	<detailed_description>Greater occipital nerve ( GON ) injection commonly perform diagnostic therapeutic procedure headache patient . GON block show effective treatment variety headache include occipital neuralgia , migraine , vascular headache , cluster headache , cervicogenic headache , post-concussive headache.The GON provide sensory innervation posterior scalp vertex skull know communicate third occipital nerve less occipital nerve ascent occiput.The use ultrasound guidance assist needle placement become increasingly popular due real-time visualization soft tissue surround vasculature well appearance bony structure . This image tool allows fine adjustment needle tip direct observation injectate thereby confirm local anesthetic spread target area . Local anesthetic steroid successfully use diagnostic therapeutic nerve pain lumbar radicultis great success . Dexamethasone water soluble steroid , combine local anesthetic ; may increase analgesia block duration relative pharmacokinetics . When compare dexamethasone , triamcinolone , particulate steroid slow onset time may provide anti-inflammatory effect several week . Investigators want investigate see exist difference report pain intensity use particulate anti-inflammatory corticosteroid ( triamcinolone bupivacaine ) may provide great reduction report pain intensity relief may allow patient undergo few interventional procedure .</detailed_description>
