	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect iron chelation therapeutic strategy slow progression Parkinson 's disease . Half participant receive deferiprone 15 mg / kg twice daily morning evening ( 30mg / kg per day ) , half receive placebo . The treatment last nine month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conservative Iron Chelation Disease-modifying Strategy Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This new concept `` conservative iron chelation '' . We recently demonstrate ( first time ) feasibility , efficacy acceptability conservative iron chelation approach pilot translational study Parkinson 's disease prototype drug : deferiprone ( 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one ) ( FAIR-PARK-I project lead applicant fund French Ministry Health ) . The available blood-brain-barrier-permeable iron chelator deferiprone approve treat systemic iron overload transfuse patient thalassemia . Deferiprone European Union market since 1999 , favourable risk/benefit balance dose 75 100 mg/kg/day . The investigator shall adopt reposition strategy use deferiprone low dose 30 mg/kg/day new indication local iron overload Parkinson 's disease . Deferiprone first-in-class drug novel therapeutic strategy . On basis preclinical clinical data ( FAIR-PARK-I ) , present ( FAIR-PARK-II ) project constitute model future cytoprotection strategy neurodegenerative disease ; deferiprone treatment associate significant slow disease progression , would first non-dopaminergic drug prove disease-modifying effect Parkinson 's disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult patient 2 . Parkinson 's disease diagnose accord United Kingdom Parkinson 's disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria base presence least two three cardinal feature disease ( rest tremor , bradykinesia rigidity ) . If rest tremor present , subject must unilateral onset symptom . 3 . Treatmentnaïve , i.e . best population assess diseasemodifying effect without interaction dopaminergic treatment ( dopaminergic agonist , Ldopa , anticholinergic , monoamine oxidase B inhibitor ( e.g . rasagiline ) deep brain stimulation ) . 4 . Patients cover Health Insurance System country require law 5 . Written inform consent date sign prior begin procedure related clinical trial 1 . Disease duration great 18 month . 2 . Patients high frequency comorbidity vital risk may reasonably impair life expectancy 3 . Subject handicap require dopaminergic treatment inclusion therefore likely bear 9 month without symptomatic treatment 4 . Hoehn Yahr stage 3 . 5 . Significant cognitive impairment ( Mini Mental State Examination score &lt; 24 equivalent impairment similar scale ) dementia diagnose accordance Movement Disorders Society criterion ( Emre et al. , 2007 ) . 6 . Atypical secondary parkinsonism ( supranuclear palsy , multisystem atrophy , etc . ) anomalies MRI suggestive vascular involvement significant cortical subcortical atrophy ( i.e . atypical Parkinson 's Disease ) . 7 .
