	<brief_summary>The null hypothesis patient screen PET/CT detection disease recurrence earlier screened CT alone . The alternative hypothesis PET/CT surveillance lead detection disease recurrence 3 month earlier CT surveillance . Furthermore , reject null hypothesis , early detection must associate cause-specific survival improvement 10 % . Primary endpoint include time completion definitive therapy diagnosis recurrent disease , absolute survival within 3 year completion initial therapy . Duration survival diagnosis recurrence subsequent death primary endpoint investigator expect PET/CT offer opportunity early recognition recurrence subject lead-time bias . Duration survival measure completion primary treatment death . Note : presence residual disease surgical consolidation constitute recurrence event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Trial PET/CT vs. CTSurveilance Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck cancer ( HNC ) sixth lead incident cancer worldwide 600,000 case expect 2012.1 The vast majority case head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) , comprise &gt; 90 % histology . Despite advance multimodality therapy HNSCC , 5-year overall survival ( OS ) 40-60 % , increase incrementally past two decades.2 Improved prognosis largely attributable emerge epidemic oral human papillomavirus infection ( HPV ) . An increase proportion oropharyngeal HNC drive oncogenic HPV , rather classic risk factor tobacco alcohol ; HPV etiology associate improved survival conventional treatments.3,4 Most patient HNC present locally advanced disease ( stage III-IVb ) , associate anatomic deformity due primary tumor neck adenopathy . Intensive multi-modality therapy include surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy routinely require . The current standard care primary nonsurgical management previously untreated locally advanced ( PULA ) HNSCC concurrent cisplatin-radiotherapy ( RT ) , administer sentinel Intergroup trial 0126 5,6 . Likewise , standard care adjuvant management high risk disease cisplatin-RT proven Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 95-01 European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) 22931 trials.7,8 Despite curative-intent surgical non-surgical therapy , approximately half people relapse . Unlike epithelial malignancy , dominant pattern relapse driver HNC-related mortality locoregional recurrence.9 The vast majority recurrence occur within first two year follow definitive therapy . Patient evaluation follow completion definitive therapy HNC confound anatomic deformity begin primary tumor nodal metastatic disease , compound treatment-related effect scar , flap reconstruction , edema . There currently exist ideal method surveillance . National Comprehensive Cancer Center Network ( NCCN ) guideline call physical examination intermittent imaging require . Clinical trial design incorporate definitive chemoradiotherapy typically employ diagnostic , contrast-enhanced CT neck every 3 month 1 year , follow every 6 month 1 year , follow annual evaluation ( eg . ECOG 1308 ; UPCI 07-021 ) . Single-arm prospective study suggest positron emission tomography ( PET ) fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) sensitive CT physical examination alone residual recurrent disease , particularly conduct integrate diagnostic CT scan . In study , negative PET/CT scan correlate low likelihood residual nodal pathology improve DFS.12,13 The current practice University Pittsburgh employ PET/CT surveillance , particular follow definitive chemoradiotherapy . However , prior investigation demonstrate improved salvage survival outcome use PET/CT surveillance , clearly costly CT surveillance may carry morbidity relate increase diagnostic procedure false-positive finding . The investigator propose prospective , randomized phase III trial patient undergo definitive therapy locally advanced Stage III-IVb carcinoma involve head neck . This include primary tumor oral cavity , pharynx , larynx , well cancer salivary gland squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients realize clinical complete response definitive therapy randomize PET/CT vs. CT surveillance , test hypothesis PET/CT surveillance superior CT surveillance due early diagnosis recurrence , timely effective salvage , consequent reduction HNC mortality . The study intervention solely image modality assign surveillance . All study patient otherwise monitor strictly accord NCCN guideline , include history physical examination ( endoscopy appropriate ) . Assigned image conducted identical interval . Areas suspicious recurrence basis history physical examination , endoscopy image biopsied . Therapeutic intervention determine treatment team , include least one member medical oncology , radiation oncology , otolaryngology/head neck surgery . Patients recurrent locoregional disease offer salvage treatment indicate clinical situation .</detailed_description>
