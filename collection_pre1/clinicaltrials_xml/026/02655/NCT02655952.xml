	<brief_summary>The Wnt proteins belong family protein demonstrate play role formation dissemination tumour . The present project focus critical role Wnt-5a protein pathobiological process lead metastatic cancer disease . WntResearch identify formylated 6 amino acid peptide fragment , name Foxy-5 , mimick effect Wnt-5a impair migration epithelial cancer cell thereby act anti-metastatic . The aim first clinical phase I study establish recommend dose clinical phase II study enable development Foxy-5 first class anti-metastatic cancer drug . The study see DLTs therefore fail reach maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ; recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) could therefore establish base toxicity . The aim study continue establish safety profile Foxy-5 high dos , determine RP2D later stage development base observed DLT's/MTD analysis pharmacodynamic profile Foxy-5 determine biological response dose ( BRD ) .</brief_summary>
