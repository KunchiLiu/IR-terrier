	<brief_summary>Background . Primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) uncommon disease . Conventional treatment consist either whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) methotrexate ( MTX ) -based combined modality therapy combine chemotherapy cranial irradiation . The treatment principle institute quite consistent past , stick treatment protocol report Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 1990s . No matter dosage MTX , well-established addition chemotherapy cranial RT significantly improve survival outcome . However , find delay treatment-related cognitive sequela emerge significant debilitate complication combine modality treatment patient PCNSL , especially effective treatment achieve disease control well survival rate . Furthermore , specific contribution disease per se various treatment modality cognitive impairment remain clarified neurotoxic potential combine modality treatment difficult differentiate result cognitive dysfunction respectively . Treatment-related neurotoxicity could demonstrate virtue several meaningful indicator , include neurobehavioral assessment , neuroimaging outcome , even measure quality-of-life ( QoL ) . Methods . Therefore , one-year individual research prospective observational cohort study longitudinal assessment neurobehavioral function , neuroimaging , quality life newly-diagnosed patient primary CNS lymphoma institute . According cancer center , estimate would around 25 case newly-diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma institute every year . By virtue multidisciplinary management teamwork consist neurosurgery , hematology , radiation oncology , neuroimaging expertise , surgical pathology , investigator attempt recruit potentially eligible patient newly-diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma . Most importantly , neuropsychologists participate research project , effort integrate neurobehavioral outcome prospective study . Accordingly , battery neuropsychological measure use evaluate neurobehavioral function study patient . The battery compose ten standardized neuropsychological test , cover four domain sensitive disease treatment effect ( executive function , attention , verbal memory , psychomotor speed ) , QoL questionnaires . Expected result . This prospective cohort study aim explore evaluate patient PCNSL newly-diagnosed use standard battery neurobehavioral function plus neuroimaging study . It anticipate investigator investigate correlate neurotoxicity indicator newly-diagnosed patient PCNSL treat cranial radiotherapy combine without MTX-based chemotherapy accord multidisciplinary treatment guideline implement single institute .</brief_summary>
