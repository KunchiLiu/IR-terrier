	<detailed_description>Study design The study set open randomize control three-arm trial . Patients randomize three group . Study setup procedures The goal study determine one surgical treatment chronic subdural hematoma well . Patients clear indication drainage subdural hematoma ( state `` Surgical option '' ) randomize three group . One group receive twist drill craniostomy follow drainage 48 96 hour . One group undergo burr hole drainage ( single possible , double necessary ) irrigation drainage 48 96 hour postoperatively . One group undergo minicraniotomy trephine craniotome , wide opening visible membrane , rigorous irrigation placement Jackson-Pratt drain , follow drainage 48 96 hour . Patients diagnose chronic subdural hematoma CT scan , operate soon possible . The type operation determine randomization . The duration surgery well presence brain reexpansion ( case burr hole minicraniotomy ) record . Postoperatively , patient transfer neurosurgery ward subdural drainage system place . Drainage system remove 48 96 hour postoperatively , regardless type operation ( 48 hour standard ; long period drainage drainage le 50cc/24h evaluated second 24 hour postoperatively . Maximal time continuous drainage 4 day 96 hour postoperatively ) . Drained volume record . Evaluation perform preoperatively , 48h postoperatively , discharge , 6 week 6 month , include : - Age , sex , comorbidities ( anticoagulation coagulopathy , dementia , etc ) - Clinical status ( cognitive state ( orientation time , place person ) , Speech ( aphasia/dysarthria ) , Motor function ( hemiplegia/paresis ) ; walk independently ( y/n ) ; independence ADL ( y/n ) ; Markwalders Scale , modify Rankin Scale - Imaging characteristic ( location ( frontal/parietal/occipital , uni-bilateral ) , size ( max diameter ) , Density ( Hounsfield unit , age hematoma ) , membrane ( y/n ) . An approximate total five CTscans perform , total ( 5x2= ) 10mSv radiation exposure Length hospital stay record . The primary endpoint reoperation rate 40 day . We hypothesize subdural hematoma treat minicraniotomy require less reoperation ( reduced 5 % ) burr hole craniostomy twist drill craniotomy ( 15 25 % accord literature ) . Secondary endpoint : Clinical endpoint : Duration operation , technical difficulty operation . Duration hospital stay . Improvement Clinical status speed thereof , Improvement CT-imaging characteristic , complication rate ( bleeding , local systemic infection , epilepsy , … ) . We expect subdural hematoma operate minicraniotomy large open membrane lead quicker improvement CT-imaging burr hole treatment twist drill craniotomy . Exploratory endpoint To determine type intervention beneficial type patient . Hypothesis case homogenous chronic subdural hematoma , twist drill craniostomy would pose least risk , whereas multiloculated mixed-density hematoma , minicraniotomy would best option . The subject Number subject A total 150 patient include study . Inclusion criteria All consecutive patient chronic subdural hematoma indication surgical intervention : clinical symptom result subdural collection , important mass effect ( indicated midline shift 5mm ) Exclusion criterion Patients age 18 exclude Patients undergone previous cranial surgery would limit surgical option ( example bone flap already place ) Replacement subject Dropout , case trial , would signify loss follow-up since patient operate consent participation trial . In case dropout , available data evaluate included analysis possible . If dropout occurs schedule six week postoperative visit , data still usable analysis primary endpoint . Data earlier treatment ( example duration surgery , hospital stay , etc ) usable analysis secondary endpoint . Restrictions prohibition subject Antiaggregant drug ( Aspirin , Asaflow , Cardioaspirine , Plavix , Clopidogrel , Ticlid , … ) stop least 5 day ( ideally 10days ) surgery possible , necessary ( discussed treat physician/cardiologist ) , replace short act low molecular weight heparin give subcutaneously ( administration day surgery ) . Anticoagulants ( Sintrom , Marcoumar , Marevan ) replace short act low molecular weight heparin give subcutaneously ( administration day surgery ) . Study analysis Sample size calculation Power sample size estimation base data literature indicate reoperation rate 40 day burr hole craniostomy twist drill craniotomy range 25 % 15 % ( control group ) , assumption minicraniotomy would decrease reoperation rate 40 day 5 % . In test trend proportion , sample size 49 , 49 , 49 obtain 3 group proportion equal 0.25 , 0.15 , 0.05 . The total sample 147 subject achieve 81 % power detect linear trend use two-sided Z test continuity correction significance level alpha 0.05 .
