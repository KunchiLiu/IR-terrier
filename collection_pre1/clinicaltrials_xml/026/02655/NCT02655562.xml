	<brief_summary>Cough common symptom lead patient worldwide seek medical attention . Subacute cough refers cough 3-8-week duration , typically refractory standard anti-tussive therapy , tendency spontaneous heal common . Few clinical trial evaluate therapeutic option subacute cough . Airway inflammation important feature subacute cough , Cysteinyl leukotrienes FeNO correlate airway inflammation . Subacute cough often represent prolonged post-viral response . Cysteinyl leukotrienes increase virus infection . Airway inflammation induce epithelial cell produce iNOS ( inducible nitric oxide synthase , iNOS ) , FeNO increase theory . Montelukast cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor antagonist report improve cough16 reduces FENO prevents increase FENO reduction inhale corticosteroid dose , But A meta-analysis effectiveness LTRA ( leukotriene receptor antagonist , LTRA ) treat child prolong non-specific cough conclude , lack evidence , routine use LTRA treat child non-specific cough recommend . A randomised , placebo-controlled trial show montelukast effective treatment postinfectious cough . Non-specialists general practitioner Japan prescribe LTRA often , increase . The aim research whether FeNO use biomarker direct montelukast treatment optimize treatment regimen sub-acute cough .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project prospective , open label , randomize control trial . All subacute cough patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion recruit sign consent form . Patients randomized biomarker treatment armand standard treatment arm . Patients biomarker treatment arm FENO≥25ppb give Montelukast Sodium Tablets ( p.o. , 10mg , q.d . ) . Patients biomarker reatment arm FENO＜25ppb give placebo ( p.o. , 10mg , qd ) . Patients standard treatment arm FENO≥25ppb give placebo ( p.o. , 10mg , qd ) . Patients standard treatment arm FENO＜25ppb give Montelukast Sodium Tablets ( p.o. , 10mg , q.d . ) .All treatment regimen last 10 day antitussive/decongestant bronchodilator give patient . Examine result patient arm record 10 day treatment . The examine record FENO level , cough symptom assessment , cough visual assessment , Leicester cough questionnaire , total white blood cell count , neutrophil blood percentage , eosinophil blood percentage . Patient cough free day treatment Montelukast Sodium Tablets . Follow carry 8th week first record symptom 2 month treatment .</detailed_description>
