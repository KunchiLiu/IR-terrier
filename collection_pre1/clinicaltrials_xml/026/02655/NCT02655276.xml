	<brief_summary>This study design investigate effect attentional performance motoric activity 100 mg microencapsulated glycine ( Bidicin® Biotiki® ) compare placebo treatment t.i.d . sublingual dose 3 week . The primary objective study determine effect attentional performance motoric activity 100 mg microencapsulated Glycine ( Bidicin® Biotiki® ) compare placebo treatment t.i.d . sublingual dose 3 week child low attentional performance high motoric activity . A number 30 prepuberal boy girl age 6 - 14 year low attentional performance high motoric activity enrol study . The prepuberal status determine Tanner stage ≤ 3 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trial Design : This study double-blind , randomize , two-period , cross-over design . The study population randomize equally sequence 1 ( first 3 week microencapsulated Glycine , second 3 week placebo ) sequence 2 ( first 3 week placebo , second 3 week microencapsulated Glycine ) . Study Agent/Placebo - Dosage Route Administration : Study Agent/Placebo first dispense Visit 2 ( day 0 ) . Treatment assignment make accordance randomization . At visit ( Visit 2 Visit 3 ) , subject receive two blister 3 follow week . Only qualified personnel may dispense study Agent/Placebo . Investigational reference treatment : 100 mg microencapsulated Glycine ( Bidicin® Biotiki® ) Placebo Biotiki® Study design : This study employ double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled cross-over design . SKAMP raters teacher blind concern study Agent/Placebo . Planned Study Time Schedule : The study end 10 week enrollment last patient ( total study end ) . Study duration patient 7 10 week ( inclusion ) last visit ( close-out visit ) . Statistics : Sample size calculation base primary endpoint `` mean SKAMP Combined score time point classroom setting '' . The study sufficient power detect difference treatment moderate effect size ( correspond Cohen 's d=0.5 ) present parallel-group study two independent patient group . Assuming correlation measurement patient 0.6 , translates effect size 0.56 cross-over trial compare within patient measurement . With effect size , 27 patient include study , achieve power 0.8 two-sided significance level alpha=0.05 . To account small number drop-outs , 30 patient randomize . Data analysis : The trial analyze accord intention-to-treat principle . Efficacy measure evaluate linear mixed model repeat measurement . Safety analysis perform subject receive least one dose microencapsulated Glycine/ placebo . Incidences adverse event serious adverse event calculate .</detailed_description>
