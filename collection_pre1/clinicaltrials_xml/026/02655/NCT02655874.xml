	<brief_summary>TROPICS1 randomize , observer-blind , active comparator-controlled , single-center , Phase IV trial 200 participant age ≥65 year . The control group receive standard dose license trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine day 1 , active-comparator ( Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine ) day 180 . Participants experimental group receive influenza vaccine day 1 day 180 . Endpoints immunological , include measure haemagglutination-inhibition ( HI ) titres , micro-neutralisation titre cell-mediated immunity 4 time point initial vaccination Day 360 . The primary hypothesis participant receive influenza booster day 180 achieve superior influenza seroprotection ( HI titre ≥1:40 ) day 208 , compare control . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate global annual burden seasonal influenza 1 billion infection , 3-5 million severe case 300,000-500,000 death . The pattern impact infection vary considerably climate . In temperate country , influenza epidemic characteristically occur cold winter month , sub-tropical country , coincide rainy season . Closer equator , influenza virus activity complex . In Singapore , biannual epidemic usual , continuous transmission year-round . Bi-annual epidemic , tri-annual epidemic year round virus activity also describe tropical country , Indonesia Malaysia Peru Mexico . There publish data report year-round influenza vaccine effectiveness elderly country continuous influenza virus activity . Despite numerous study worldwide explore HI antibody response influenza vaccination , majority continue follow beyond seroconversion ( 21-28 day ) . However , available , HI antibody titre decline follow influenza vaccination elderly , within 6-12 month geometric mean titre approach pre-vaccination level . With biannual epidemic year-round transmission tropical region , year-round seroprotection may important reduce influenza infection environment . A six-monthly vaccination cycle would correspond decline vaccine-induced seroprotection elderly , 6-monthly periodicity outbreak Singapore tropical country .</brief_summary>
