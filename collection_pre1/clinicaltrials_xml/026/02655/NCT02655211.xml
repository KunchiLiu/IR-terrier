	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy pulse dye laser ( PDL ) carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) laser conjunction usual care ( MED ) treatment hypertrophic burn scar determine optimal sequence time laser usual care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser Induced Bioengineered Remodeling Thermally Injured Skin Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator compare usual care ( MED ) , offer patient , two type laser treatment ( PDL CO2 ) , investigator hypothesize beneficial . The timing sequence therapy randomize , patient receive form laser treatment . If investigator simply stop end Aim 1 , investigator would complete traditional randomize control trial ( RCT ) , patient potentially receive laser treatment . However , investigator interest determine whether sequence laser treatment beneficial ; therefore , investigator employ sequential multiple assignment randomize trial ( SMART ) design . Because nature study SMART design , investigator offer patient form laser therapy .</detailed_description>
