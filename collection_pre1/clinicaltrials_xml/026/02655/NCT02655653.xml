	<brief_title>Efficacy Tranexamic Acid Epsilon-aminocaproic Acid Reducing Bleeding Transfusions Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center double blind randomize control study compare effectiveness epsilon-aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) tranexamic acid ( TA ) reduce 24hour blood transfusion chest tube drainage . From October 2008 September 2011 , patient great 18 year age , schedule cardiac surgery require CPB consent . Eligible operation include ; coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) , heart valve repair/replacement , concomitant CABG valve surgery enrol . Consented patient randomize one two group use 1:1 randomization sequence generate computer program . Randomization sequence study drug keep lock box open unblinded study personnel involve clinical care patient . This person prepare study drug follow instruction study protocol , result preparation EACA TA contain equi-potent similar volume drug syringe , order ensure blinding . Antifibrinolytic study drug administer follow anesthetic induction . EACA administer bolus load dose 150 mg/ kg follow maintenance infusion 15 mg/ kg /hr . TA administer bolus dose 30 mg /kg follow 16 mg/ kg/hour maintenance infusion . Maintenance infusion drug discontinue patient arrive cardiac surgical intensive care unit . In addition routine blood sampling ( standard care investigator hospital ) , patient thromboelastogram ( TEG ) D-dimer level draw follow time point : post incision prior initial antifibrinolytic load , immediately follow antifibrinolytic load dose , post-protamine reversal heparin . The primary endpoint amount chest tube drainage amount blood product use first 24 hour follow surgery ( surrogate measurement blood loss ) measure 4 , 8 , 12 24 hour surgery . The incidence pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) , fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) , cryoprecipitate platelet administer first 24 hour surgery collect . Additionally , patient monitor complication stay hospital 30 day post-operatively . Complications include renal dysfunction ( define need least 1 hemodialysis double pre-surgical creatinine level ) , stroke seizure ( clinically diagnose ) , myocardial infarction ( new Q wave two electrocardiogram lead ) , cardiac arrest , respiratory failure , re-operation death . Monitoring patient prior discharge involve chart review stay hospital ; post-operative complication suspect , complication confirm use Montefiore Medical Center 's Carecast Database , contain independent result MRI 's , CT scan , lab . Additionally , computer record patient search determine document complication 30-day post-operative time period .</detailed_description>
