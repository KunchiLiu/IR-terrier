	<detailed_description>The VS/VC STN 'stations ' neural circuitry think dysfunctional OCD . The pre-eminent neurobiological model OCD implicate abnormality orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) ventral striatum . These structure integral limbic cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry whereby cortical output synapse successively ventral striatum , ventral pallidum mediodorsal nucleus thalamus project back cortex ; within system , pallidum project thalamus either directly indirectly via subthalamic nucleus . It therefore possible observed clinical improvement OCD DBS due high frequency electrical stimulation disrupt abnormal activity limbic circuit obtain either two target site . However , ventral striatum STN think separate function , important different way modulate information process cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry essential control behaviour . Thus , although VS/VC STN DBS affect neural circuit , mechanism action may quite different stimulation location may unique effect symptom dimension OCD . Evidence different clinical effect come finding VS/VC DBS produce early sometimes dramatic mood elevation anxiety reduction prior improvement obsession compulsion whereas STN DBS , diminish obsession compulsion , effect emotion . This observation relevant mood anxiety significant symptom dimension OCD increase decrease severity anxiety depression generally accompany parallel change severity obsessions/compulsions . The ventral striatum , well first target OFC/ACC cortical output , receive input amygdala midbrain dopaminergic neurones , together provide emotional motivational impetus goal direct behaviour . The ventral striatum therefore unique position , via involvement limbic cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuitry , influence cognitive motor processing parallel circuit preparatory action selection ultimately manifest thought action . Denys colleague propose VS/VC DBS influence OCD symptom via effect anxiety mood . Taking , Investigators hypothesize stimulation ventral striatal neurones influence reinforcement learn emotion processing thereby improve mood reduce anxiety result decrease intensity obsession compulsion . STN DBS hand may direct effect obsession compulsion . The limbic STN , like ventral striatum , unique position influence behavioural output cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry . This STN receive direct projection right inferior frontal cortex act 'hyperdirect pathway ' , activation override neural process direct cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic pathway . This result inhibition ongoing , plan act thought . Investigators therefore hypothesise , via inhibitory mechanism , stimulation STN neurones enables OCD patient interrupt repetitive thought action result decrease obsession compulsion . Accordingly , DBS sit , different mechanism action , predict clinically effective stimulation either site alone . It also follow two mechanism mediate OCD improvement , evident different pattern cognitive neurophysiological effect follow DBS . In proposed study Investigators test prediction clinically experimentally use paradigm design distinguish two hypothetical mechanism action . The main aim CBT enable OCD patient obtain great control behaviour inhibit repetitive thought act switch meaningful alternative . One abnormal mechanism contribute cognitive inflexibility think blunt value positive negative reinforcement normally use guide response dependent intact OFC-striatal neural circuitry . Dysfunction cognitive control system show first-degree clinically unaffected relative OCD patient thus confirm mechanism neurobiological phenotype OCD 15.It therefore hypothesise DBS VS/VC improve processing reinforce stimuli result elevation mood reduction anxiety also increase cognitive flexibility . Investigators test measure effectiveness VS/VC DBS clinical measure mood , anxiety , obsession compulsion relate change reinforcement learn emotional processing use cognitive task sensitive OCD measure ability respond appropriately reinforce contingency . Attentional process also think contribute impaired behavioural control OCD . Being able stop inhibit planned act environmental circumstance change depend function right inferior cortical-STN hyperdirect pathway operationalised measure stop signal reaction time ( SSRT ) . The finding specific prolongation SSRT OCD patient unaffected first-degree relative suggest cognitive abnormality also phenotype OCD . Although neural substrate mechanism involve limbic cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic circuit , recent evidence suggest neural system outside circuitry , involve right inferior frontal cortex , impaired OCD . Investigators therefore hypothesise STN DBS allow inhibition repetitive thought act OCD facilitate action hyperdirect pathway right inferior frontal cortex STN . Investigators test measure effectiveness STN DBS obsession compulsion relate change SSRT performance task sensitive right inferior frontal cortex function measure ability inhibit pre-potent tendency . OCD symptom cognitive impairment may mediate abnormal cortical excitability due aberrant long term depression ( LTD ) synaptic plasticity and/or reduce gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) mediate intracortical inhibition . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) use measure neurophysiological process safely patient undergo DBS abnormality show normalise follow DBS disorder . Investigators use TMS assess neural process DBS OCD patient test whether differential change two DBS sit whether combine VS/VC STN DBS produce vigorous improvement compatible hypothesis concern superior clinical effect condition . Investigators measure intracortical inhibition rest also anticipation reinforcement , previously show affect motor cortex excitability Investigators predict specifically affect VS/VC DBS .</detailed_description>
