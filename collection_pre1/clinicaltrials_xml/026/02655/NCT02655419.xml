	<criteria>1 . Provision inform consent prior studyspecific procedure . 2 . Male female 18 90 year age inclusive . 3 . Female patient authorized participate clinical study criterion concern pregnancy avoidance state protocol meet 4 . Diagnosis cIAI EITHER : Intraoperative/postoperative enrolment visual confirmation ( presence pu within abdominal cavity ) intraabdominal infection associate peritonitis . Surgical intervention include open laparotomy , percutaneous drainage abscess , laparoscopic surgery . Specimens surgical intervention must send culture . Patients undergo surgical procedure complete fascial closure appropriate trial . The skin incision may leave open purpose wind management long complete fascial closure accomplish . The patient least 1 follow diagnosed surgical intervention : 1 . Cholecystitis gangrenous rupture perforation progression infection beyond gallbladder wall 2 . Diverticular disease perforation abscess 3 . Appendiceal perforation periappendiceal abscess 4 . Acute gastric duodenal perforation , operate &gt; 24 hour diagnosis 5 . Traumatic perforation intestine , operate &gt; 12 hour diagnosis ( f ) Secondary peritonitis ( spontaneous bacterial peritonitis associate cirrhosis chronic ascites ) ( g ) Intra abdominal abscess ( include liver spleen provide extension beyond organ evidence intraperitoneal involvement ) OR Preoperative enrollment follow clinical criterion meet confirmation infection surgical intervention within 24 hour entry : 1 . Requirement surgical intervention , define per protocol open laparotomy , percutaneous drainage abscess , laparoscopic surgery 2 . Evidence systemic inflammatory response , least one following : Fever ( define body temperature &gt; 38°C ) hypothermia core body temperature &lt; 35°C Elevated white blood cell ( &gt; 12000 cells/μL ) Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg mean arterial pressure &lt; 70 mmHg , systolic blood pressure decrease &gt; 40 mmHg Increased heart rate ( &gt; 90 bpm ) respiratory rate ( &gt; 20 breaths/min ) Hypoxemia ( define oxygen saturation &lt; 95 % pulse oximetry ) Altered mental status . 3 . Physical finding consistent intraabdominal infection , : Abdominal pain and/or tenderness , without rebound Localized diffuse abdominal wall rigidity Abdominal mass . 4 . Supportive radiologic image finding intraabdominal infection perforate intraperitoneal abscess detect compute tomography scan , magnetic resonance image , ultrasound . 5 . Specimens surgical intervention send culture isolation aerobic anaerobic bacteria . 5 . Patients fail prior antibacterial treatment current cIAI enrol must : Have know suspected pathogen cause cIAI resistant prior therapy assume organism know sensitive ATMAVI . Require surgical intervention . 6 . Patient must surgical intervention within 24 hour ( ) administration first dose study drug Exclusion criterion : 1 . Involvement plan and/or conduct study 2 . Patient previously enrol study , previously treat ATMAVI previously participate investigation study contain AVI 3 . Patient participate intend participate clinical study involve administration investigational medication time presentation , course study , 30 day prior study start . 4 . Patient history serious allergy , hypersensitivity ( eg , anaphylaxis ) , serious reaction aztreonam , carbapenem , monobactam βlactam antibiotic , avibactam , nitroimidazoles metronidazole , excipients respective ( investigational ) medicinal product administer study 5 . Patient diagnosis abdominal wall abscess ; small bowel obstruction ischemic bowel disease without perforation ; traumatic bowel perforation surgery within 12 hour diagnosis ; perforation gastroduodenal ulcer surgery within 24 hour diagnosis ( consider situation peritoneal soil infection become establish ) ; another intraabdominal process primary etiology likely infectious 6 . Patient simple cholecystitis , gangrenous cholecystitis without rupture , simple appendicitis , acute suppurative cholangitis , infect necrotizing pancreatitis , pancreatic abscess ischaemic/necrotic intestine without perforation 7 . Patient cIAI manage staged abdominal repair ( STAR ) , open abdomen technique situation infection source control likely achieve abdomen leave open , particularly reoperation plan , unlikely solely respond antimicrobial therapy 8 . At screening , know patient infection due pathogen unlikely respond ATMAVI plus metronidazole treatment 9 . Patient rapidly progressive ( expect die &lt; 30 day ) terminal illness , include acute hepatic failure , respiratory failure septic shock high risk mortality due cause cIAI 10 . Patient receive systemic antibacterial agent within 72 hour period prior study entry , unless either following pertains : 1 . Patient new infection ( consider treatment failure ) follow meet : Patient receive 24 hour within 72 hour period prior study entry 2 . Patient consider fail previous treatment regimen 11 . Patient concurrent infection may interfere evaluation clinical cure study therapy 12 . Patient need effective concomitant systemic antibacterial ( oral , IV , intramuscular ) antifungal addition investigational product metronidazole 13 . Patient creatinine clearance ≤50 ml/min . Note : follow review PK safety data first 10 enrolled patient , confirmation provisional dose schedule , patient creatinine clearance 31 50 mL/min may include . 14 . Patient acute hepatitis prior 6 month , chronic hepatitis , cirrhosis ( ChildPugh class ) , acute hepatic failure , acute decompensation chronic hepatic failure 15 . Presence hepatic disease indicate aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 3 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) Screening . Patients AST and/or ALT &gt; 3 × ULN &lt; 5 × ULN eligible elevation acute , accompanied total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN documented investigator directly relate infectious process treat 16 . Patient total bilirubin &gt; 3 × ULN , unless isolate hyperbilirubinemia directly relate acute infection due know Gilbert 's disease 17 . Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) &gt; 3 × ULN . Patients value &gt; 3 × ULN &lt; 5 x ULN eligible value acute directly relate infectious process treat . 18 . Patients immunocompromising illness 19 . Known active Clostridium difficile associate diarrhoea 20 . Any condition , opinion investigator , may confound result study pose additional risk 21 . Patient resuscitate order 22 . Patient absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000/μL 23 . Patient hematocrit &lt; 25 % hemoglobin &lt; 8 gm/dL . 24 . Patient platelet count &lt; 75,000/μL . Patients platelet low 50,000 /μL permit reduction historically stable 25 . Patient currently receive treatment probenecid . 26 . Patient pregnant breastfeeding child bear potential , 27 . Patient unlikely comply protocol , 28 . Patient currently receive anticonvulsant therapy prevent recurrence past history seizure . 29 . Patient prior liver , pancreas smallbowel transplant .</criteria>
