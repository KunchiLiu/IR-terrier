	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow BMP7 Treatment Necrosis Femoral Head Adult</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Objectives Epiphyseal necrosis common young adult ( 2000 new case per year Nord Pas -de- Calais region ) result severe functional impairment disability . Drilling procedure simple , effectiveness safety discuss ( fracture risk , long discharge period , success rate 50 % stage III ) . However , optimize two way : 1 ) reduce morbidity discharge period reduce diameter channel percutaneous achievement , 2 ) increase efficiency , include coverage contribution stem cell osteogenic hormone . The purpose study test effectiveness contribution element heal necrosis . Material , Method , primary endpoint This prospective multicenter clinical trial randomize double-blind . The effect addition autologous bone marrow stem cell BMP7 heal necrosis assess magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI ) primary endpoint . Patients randomly assign two arm : 1 ) Group I : simple drilling practice , 2 ) Group II : drilling complete joint supply autologous marrow unconcentrated recombinant BMP7 ( OP1 ) . Necrosis femoral head stage I III retain Ficat ( stage III recess le 3 mm use , correspond I-III accord Steinberg ) . Forty patient include arm . A IRMN practice preoperatively 6 month 2 year . Clinical evaluation continue 5 year test survival rate ( criterion censorship = recovery hip ) Expected result possible implication In term radiological stabilization ( NMRI ) effectiveness single drilling necrosis stage I III Ficat 60 % ( non- stabilization worsen size ) . The hypothesis test gain stabilization ( / recovery ) 20 % . The clinical efficacy single drilling necrosis stage I III Ficat estimate 50 % ( 50 % recovery prosthesis 5 year ) . The assumption 20 % improvement rate success intervention . Reducing morbidity due technical modification previously test . If assumption success reach , indication drilling could reinforce especially patient multiple visceral defect usually support website University Hospital Lille Amiens CH Roubaix ( organ transplant tissue , ethyl , .. ) .</detailed_description>
