	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study Salvia hispanica seed reduce risk return disease ( recurrence ) patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Functional food , Salvia hispanica seed , health benefit beyond basic nutrition reduce disease risk promote optimal health . Salvia hispanica seed contains essential poly-unsaturated fatty acid , include omega 3 alpha linoleic acid omega 6 linoleic acid ; also contain high level antioxidant dietary soluble fiber . Salvia hispanica seed may raise omega-3 level blood and/or change bacterial population live digestive system reduce risk disease recurrence patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Salvia Hispanica Seed Reducing Risk Disease Recurrence Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess dietary supplementation functional food Salvia hispanica ( SH ) seed improve serum omega-3 ( n-3 ) fatty acid ( FA ) level patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) recently complete chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety tolerability patient take 16 gram ( g ) ( approximately 1 United States [ US ] tablespoon ) SH per day . II . Evaluate compliance stool sample collection lymphoma patient complete therapy remission . III . Evaluate SH exert measurable change stool microbiome . IV . Evaluate change n-3 level stool microbiome persist resolve participant longer take SH . OUTLINE : Patients receive Salvia hispanica seed orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 12 week . After completion study , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
