	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease common condition affect approximately 64 % 56-77 year old . This condition restrict bloody supply calf muscle . Pain occurs walk short distance increase intensity person stop , pain gradually subsides . It limit occasionally debilitate show considerable deleterious effect patient quality life . Shock wave therapy show promote new blood vessel formation improve heal amongst finding . This study aim identify whether shock wave therapy apply calf muscle cause effect improve blood supply calf muscle , reduce pain , improve walk ability quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim compare effect extracorporeal shockwave therapy ( ESWT ) placebo use sham control group walk distance subject low limb intermittent calf claudication . Extracorporeal shockwave therapy apply use PiezoWave2 shockwave system . All application adherence manufacturer 's instruction provide trained staff . The device target gastrocnemius muscle affect low leg several minute treatment session . Participants control group undergo identical process treatment give shockwaves administer sham device alternatively use . Participants several assessment prior shockwave treatment order quantify effect . Assessments include Maximum Walking Distance ( MWD ) , Claudication Distance ( CD ) Quality life questionnaire .</detailed_description>
