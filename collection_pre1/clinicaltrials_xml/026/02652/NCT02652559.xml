Study design : The study 1:1 two-arm parallel group randomise control trial compare usual inpatient NIV initiation home initiation . Study population : Seventy-two COPD patient NIV indication ( COPD GOLD stage III IV ; partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure ( PaCO2 ) &gt; 6.0 kPa stable condition , i.e .

	<brief_title>Initiation Long-term Non-invasive Ventilation COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD chronic disease high mortality morbidity worldwide . Patients end-stage COPD frequently develop CHRF associate end-of-life . In stage disease , treatment option limit . Long-term nocturnal NIV apply patient chronic alveolar hypoventilation decade . While doubt apply chronic nocturnal NIV improve outcomes patient restrictive neuromuscular disease , evidence COPD patient long controversial . At HMV centre Groningen , majority patient treat NIV therefore still concern patient neuromuscular disease . Initial trial investigate chronic NIV COPD show relevant benefit , neither term improvement gas exchange improvement patient-centred outcome HRQoL.However , trial use low inspiratory pressure improvement alveolar hypoventilation partially achieve . Consequently , little improvement clinical outcome could expect . More 10 year ago , concept high-intensity NIV COPD introduce . By apply high inspiratory pressure breathe frequency aim controlled form ventilation improvement gas exchange , clinically relevant improvement HRQoL lung function observe , without undue loss patient comfort . Recently , German group conclusively show high-intensity NIV improve survival severe COPD patient CHRF . These positive result high-intensity NIV change view towards use chronic NIV stable COPD . Nowadays , investigator believe evidence long-term nocturnal NIV convincing justifies application therapy patient severe stable COPD patient CHRF . Nevertheless , broad implementation treatment potentially large group severe COPD patient , important issue solve . First , current inpatient NIV initiation process reconsider , despite tight titration base arterial blood gas , always lead good patient compliance , inconvenient patient expensive . While might think high-intensity NIV necessitate inpatient titration gain adequate reversal hypoventilation , different hospital set ups NIV initiation ( general ward , medium care unit intensive care unit ) , different way titration ( guide transcutaneous carbon dioxide ( PtCO2 ) arterial blood gas ( PaCO2 ) ) , result different outcomes different compliance long-term . Also , inpatient option expensive initiation NIV COPD routinely require 5-14 day . Recently , group HMV centre Groningen show , patient neuromuscular restrictive thoracic disease , initiation NIV safely perform home . Initiation NIV home prefer patient , equally effective save cost compare inpatient initiation . Importantly , COPD patient exclude randomise control trial ( RCT ) , start study chronic NIV COPD consider regular standard treatment option Netherlands . Furthermore , initiation NIV COPD patient time think probably difficult perform home , high-intensity NIV need patient group improve outcome . However , challenge initiation high-intensity NIV require attention , necessarily solve in-hospital . On one hand , patient COPD need high inspiratory pressure higher backup breathe frequency difficult correct alveolar hypoventilation lung parenchyma disease compare disease lung primarily affect , neuromuscular disease . On hand , investigator believe careful high-intensity NIV initiation titration focus maximal improvement PaCO2 also patient comfort . The consequence high-intensity might COPD patient need even time attention caregiver get use high pressure high backup frequency target reach , i.e . improvement gas exchange respiratory muscle unloading , condition also good long-term compliance satisfy . Finding individual high-intensity set leading sufficient improvement objective physiological parameter challenge group patient . This process therefore probably require frequent intensive monitoring . At home , investigator optimise monitoring patient use frequent non-invasive monitoring gas exchange transcutaneous measurement ( SenTec DM® , Software V-STATS 4.0 ; SenTec AG ; Therwil , Switzerland ) . Secondly , analysis data read ventilator software ( Respironics Trilogy 202® , Philips , Netherlands ) use provide information compliance actual provide ventilation . Finally , investigator aid measurement respiratory muscle activity mean surface electromyography ( EMG ) relatively new tool aid optimise NIV initiation . Surface EMG new tool might help optimise NIV initiation . It show especially high-intensity NIV able unload respiratory muscle ( Duiverman , work progress ) .This might importantly add achievement clinical relevant benefit . Until , study use non-invasive measurement respiratory muscle unload optimise initiation NIV . In last decade , I develop validated surface EMG technique use COPD patient , measure respiratory muscle activity surrogate respiratory neural drive thus muscle load . As method non-invasive , easily apply home . Furthermore , surface EMG use ass patient-ventilator asynchrony ( PVA ) . Especially high inspiratory pressure and/or high breathing frequency PVA may arise.PVA important lead increase work breathing , decrease patient comfort less effective ventilation . During traditional in-hospital NIV initiation , one might suggest indication respiratory muscle ( un ) load patient-ventilator synchrony receive observation patient . However , observation respiratory nurse mostly limited time detect event lead huge excess respiratory muscle loading , severe PVA . During home initiation , direct observation far less easy less frequent . In concordance recent study show parasternal EMG use assess PVA mixed group patient initiate home NIV , investigator show recent pilot project also surface EMG feasible measure respiratory muscle unload detect PVA , note , different setting , also high-intensity NIV ( submit work ) . As use surface EMG optimise NIV initiation relatively new , investigator extend monitor patient group include surface EMG surrogate marker respiratory muscle unload detect PVA NIV . For second issue , necessity acclimatisation time caregiver attention , elegant solution available provide home . A long initiation period well meet home , trust environment patient , save disadvantage cost prolong hospital stay . With modern technology necessary caregiver attention also provide home . Monitoring data send caregiver daily basis telemonitoring . This proven technology enable caregiver make daily basis , distance , decision regard NIV initiation process , discuss patient frequent telephone call . This call telemedicine already show valuable promising tool monitor adjust treatment patient already establish chronic NIV home . In home NIV initiation pilot project neuromuscular patient , investigator first show RCT technology feasible use NIV initiation home . The second important issue solve regard well patient selection . By collect baseline follow-up data COPD patient initiate NIV , investigator aim find predictor favourable response NIV . It known , clinical practice study , patient respond favourably . Until , data show patient CHRF benefit . Furthermore , benefit least term improvement gas exchange , seem prominent patient severe stable hypercapnia . In contrast , group show patient remain hypercapnic exacerbation uniformly benefit . An individual COPD phenotype benefit demand therapy identify . The aim present study investigate whether home initiation chronic NIV stable COPD patient CHRF non-inferior inpatient initiation term improvement PaCO2 6 month . Secondary outcome change lung function ( forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , lung volume ( total lung capacity ( TLC ) , residual volume ( RV ) RV % TLC ) , diffusion capacity ( DLCO ( % predict ) ) , change HRQoL , cost include cost-effectiveness analysis . The secondary objective study collect patient demographic ( age , weight , height , social status , HRQoL , anxiety depression score , data comorbidities medication use ) , respiratory function ( lung function well measure respiratory muscle activity , arterial blood gas ) , inflammatory blood marker , order analyse difference baseline parameter relate change HRQoL .</detailed_description>
