	<detailed_description>This two part , open-label , non-randomized trial conduct Thomas Jefferson University ( TJU ) . Initially Part 1 , two-period , crossover , dose-finding study perform 12 healthy female volunteer determine optimal dose well safety tolerability tissue-specific , contrast agent Sonazoid ( GE Healthcare , Oslo , Norway ) human lymphatic application . Each volunteer receive injection low high dose blind , sequence-randomized allocation schedule . Screening baseline assessments/procedures obtain . Each volunteer receive subdermal , low high dose Sonazoid divide four individual aliquots four location ( 12 , 3 , 6 , 9 o'clock ) around 2 cm diameter region mid-upper outer quadrant leave breast . Contrast enhance ultrasound imaging ( CEUS ) perform immediately Sonazoid administration ( i.e. , lymphosonography ) identify number , location course lymphatic channel ( LCs ) SLNs use S3000 scanner ( Siemens Medical Solutions , Mountain View , CA ) high frequency , broad bandwidth linear array . CEUS evaluation repeat 15 minute , 30 minute , 1 hour , 2 hour , 4 hour , 6 hour 24 hour post Sonazoid administration . The safety tolerability Sonazoid closely monitor throughout safety tolerability , dose-finding study . Following least one week washout , upper outer quadrant right breast injected alternate dose Sonazoid lymphosonography use identify number , location course LCs SLNs . Volunteers receive low dose first visit receive high dose next time around vice versa 1:1 ratio . All procedure initial visit repeat ( see ) , except leave breast ( inject initially ) assess sonographically presence contrast-enhanced tissue ( injection site well lymphatic structure ) prior contrast administration right breast . In Part 2 lymphosonography compare SLN identification isotope mapping surgery 90 female , breast cancer patient . A state-of-the-art S3000 scanner contrast-specific imaging capability use localize lymphatic drainage breast cancer subdermal administration Sonazoid . The number location SLNs identify two image modality ( CEUS isotope map ) compare dye-guided surgery reference standard SLN detection . Moreover , SLN resect assessed ex vivo presence radioactivity ( use gamma probe ) , Sonazoid ( use CEUS ) blue dye ( via visual inspection surgeon ) . All SLNs surgically remove documented sent histopathologic evaluation . Trial Population : Part 1 consist 12 healthy , adult female volunteer initial safety , tolerability dosing study . In Part 2 , 90 adult woman , breast cancer schedule surgical excision SLN evaluation , enrol clinical trial TJU . Statistical Methodology : Our statistical analysis address four major question : - Is subdermal administration Sonazoid humans safe tolerable ? - Can optimal efficacious dose Sonazoid lymphosonography establish ? - Does lymphosonography identify SLNs patient breast cancer isotope mapping ( Tc-99m sulfur colloid ) ? - Does lymphosonography identify SLNs metastatic deposit patient breast cancer compare isotope mapping ?</detailed_description>

Participation investigational drug study within period start 1 month study drug administration . Subject mentally legally incapacitate , significant emotional problem time prestudy ( screen ) visit expect conduct study history clinically significant psychiatric disorder within last 5 year . Subjects situational depression may enrol study discretion Investigator . Subject history illness , opinion study Investigator , might confound result study pose additional risk subject participation study . An estimated creatinine clearance â‰¤80 ml/min base CockcroftGault equation . An actual creatinine clearance , determine 24 hour urine collection , may use place CockcroftGault equation . Subjects actual estimate creatinine clearance 70 ml/min may enrol discretion investigator . A history neoplastic disease , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer . Any condition precluding subject participation per investigator judgment . Part 2 : Females pregnant nursing . Patients prior breast reduction .

Patients uncontrolled congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class IV ) Patients recent cerebral hemorrhage . Patients undergone surgery within 24 hour prior study sonographic examination . Patients history anaphylactic allergy egg egg product , manifest one follow symptom : generalize urticaria , difficulty breathing , swell mouth throat , hypotension , shock . ( Subjects nonanaphylactic allergy egg egg product may enrol study , must watch carefully 1 h follow administration Sonazoid ) . Patients cardiac shunt unstable cardiopulmonary condition . Patients congenital heart defect . Patients severe emphysema , pulmonary vasculitis , pulmonary hypertension history pulmonary embolus .
