	<brief_summary>A prospective , pilot study use acoustic radiation force imaging ( ARFI ) ultrasound ( US ) quantify liver stiffness child young adult chronic liver disease . ARFI result compare current clinical standard Magnetic Resonance Elastography ( MRE ) liver biopsy available .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination Liver Stiffness Chronic Liver Disease Patients Acoustic Radiation Force Imaging ( ARFI ) Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ARFI US novel technique , recently FDA approve use child adult , provide alternative method quantify liver stiffness . ARFI US show small pilot investigation Europe child reliable rapid estimate moderate severe liver stiffness use histology reference gold standard . ARFI measure speed shear wave examine tissue , express m/s . This shear wave velocity mathematically convert liver stiffness value , use estimate degree liver fibrosis . The technique non-invasive , use ionize radiation , fast ( several minute complete ) . It possible ARFI US accurate MRE quantify liver stiffness . In addition , ARFI US ultimately less expensive clinical test , short duration , require sedation/anesthesia young child MRE require .</detailed_description>
