	<brief_summary>This study focus rare cell population call fibrocytes peripheral blood synovial tissue Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) . One group patient early RA one group long-standing RA . Both group follow 6 month . After informed write consent control group also form : One synovial biopsy patient undergo routine arthroscopy , peripheral blood sample also take . The hypothesis fibrocytes present blood synovial tissue RA . Patients early long-standing RA high concentration fibrocytes peripheral blood synovial tissue compare control group . Levels fibrocytes peripheral blood synovial tissue correlate RA disease activity measure image finding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intimal lining synovial joint consist unique cell call fibroblast-like synoviocytes ( FLS cell ) intersperse macrophage-like synoviocytes . In healthy joint macrophage-like synoviocytes implicate innate immune defence support adaptive immunity , FLS cell function regulate release nutrient molecule , include hyaluronan , joint cavity . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic systemic disease autoimmune trait , primarily affect synovial joint . The intimal lining synovium expand exhibit characteristic unregulated growth loss contact inhibition . The expand synovium degrades cartilage erode bone cartilage-bone interface , create hallmark RA , joint erosion . The RA FLS cell , markedly different phenotype healthy cell , play key role destructive process release pro-inflammatory cytokine matrix destructive enzyme . FLS cell expand joint destructive process , however , minimal mitotic activity . The origin expand FLS population therefore uncertain . Possible explanation phenomenon could decrease senescence , migration mesenchymal stem cell circulation , epithelial mesenchymal cell-transition expansion stem cell pool synovium . FLS precursor could also migrate synovium pore cortical bone , demonstrated mouse collagen-induced arthritis . In murine model , show RA FLS cell spread via systemic circulation one joint attack previously unaffected joint . A possible FLS cell precursor identify peripheral blood call fibrocytes . Fibrocytes spindle-shaped cell express surface receptor stromal hematopoietic cell . The fibrocytes rare ( ~0.5 % leukocyte ) population bone marrow derive mesenchymal progenitor cell . A combination marker distinguish fibrocytes monocyte , macrophage fibroblast describe . In vitro circulate human peripheral blood mononuclear cell monocyte ( CD14+ ) differentiate fibrocytes . Fibrocytes differentiate vitro along multiple mesenchymal lineage adipocytes , chondrocytes , myofibroblasts osteoblast . It unknown differentiation pathway occur vivo multiple differentiation profile occur . Increased number circulate fibrocytes find murine RA model . In small sample RA patient ( six patient , ten control ) , peripheral blood fibrocytes elevate phosphorylation activation compare control , cell demonstrate synovium . Here fibrocyte activation correlate arthritis disease activity ( DAS28 ) . In murine model , activate circulate fibrocytes find migrate arthritis joint preclinical phase disease , accumulate FLS cell layer synovium . Adoptive transfer circulate fibrocytes murine model , lead worsen joint disease indicate circulate fibrocytes involve RA joint pathology , possibly FLS-cell precursor . Further , fibrocytes also implicate extra articular manifestation RA , e.g . pericarditis ( murine model ) , atherosclerosis , interstitial lung disease . Studies synovial biopsy critical understanding RA pathogenesis . A new method collect synovial tissue , ultrasound-guided synovial biopsy safe well tolerated patient reliable collect high quality synovial tissue large small joint .</detailed_description>
