	<brief_summary>Background : When threat body , immune system trigger inflammation . Too much inflammation damage body cause painful symptom . Some people HIV feel sick start HIV drug recover immune system cause much inflammation . Or immune system become activated time . This cause serious health problem . Researchers want test drug CC-11050 help treat inflammation people take HIV drug . Objectives : To test CC-11050 safe well-tolerated people HIV take HIV drug . To see reduces inflammation . Eligibility : People age 18 old HIV antiretroviral therapy least 1 year . Design : Participants screen : Medicine review Physical exam medical history Blood urine test Chest x-ray Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) : Soft electrode skin record heart signal . Participants randomly assign take capsule either CC-11050 placebo . They take capsule every day 12 week . They continue take HIV drug . Participants baseline visit within 2 month screen . This include : Physical exam medical history Blood urine test ECG Leukapheresis : Blood remove needle one arm pass machine remove white blood cell . The rest blood return needle arm . Participants follow-up visit 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 week baseline visit . These may include repeat baseline test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CC-11050 novel anti-inflammatory compound potential treat variety chronic inflammatory condition cytokine storm associate infectious disease . CC-11050 selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor ( PDE4 ) active several vivo model inflammatory disease , inhibit systemic TNF- production , colitis symptom colon , psoriasiform feature skin , arthritogenic swell joint , neutrophilia eosinophilia lung , reduce choroidal neovascularization . These data suggest CC-11050 may therapeutic potential chronic inflammatory condition and/or antiangiogenic treatment . The safety profile CC-11050 investigate healthy male subject cutaneous lupus erythematosus ; frequently report adverse event fatigue , headache , upper respiratory infection pruritus ; death serious adverse event . Inflammation important contributor HIV pathogenesis prior ART initiation . Inflammatory response occur abruptly upon ART initiation ( know immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome IRIS ) chronic person suppress plasma HIV viremia treat ART , link excess risk non-AIDS serious event cardiovascular , liver kidney disease accelerate bone loss . Corticosteroids reduce level inflammatory cytokine plasma standard therapeutic intervention IRIS , however target anti-inflammatory less broadly immunosuppressive intervention desirable . We propose double-blind , randomized trial ass safety CC-11050 adult HIV infection take ART least 1 year suppress plasma viremia . Enrolled subject randomize 2:1 200 mg CC-11050 placebo twice daily 12 week . Participants evaluate week 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 16 . Changes plasma HIV-1 RNA level ( clinical assay ) , CD4+ T cell count percentages , effect marker systemic inflammation ( e.g. , TNF , IL-6 , CRP , IFNg , sCD14 , D-dimer ) measure . The effect CC-11050 cellular immune activation ( T cell monocyte ) , viral reservoir ( cell associate HIV DNA RNA ) also assess .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Adults ( great equal 18 year ) 2 . Body mass index ( BMI ) less equal 35 kg/m2 3 . On ART minimum 1 year stable regimen ( accord DHHS guideline ) least 3 month prior screen 4 . Plasma HIV1 RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL screening ( patient 50499 &lt; 500 copies/mL screening may ask return rescreening four ( 4 ) week later 5 . Men woman must willing take appropriate precaution prevent pregnancy describe 6 . Willingness undergo genetic test 7 . Willingness allow storage specimens future analysis 8 . Negative serum urine pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) 9 . Under care primary care physician outside NIH Contraception : The effect CC11050 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , subject must agree become pregnant . Females childbearing potential must pregnancy test initiating study agent study visit . Because risk involve , male female study participant engage sexual activity result pregnancy must agree use male female condom every potentially reproductive sexual encounter , AS WELL AS one method list , begin baseline visit continue 3 month discontinuation study agent . Acceptable method follow : Hormonal contraception [ e.g . consistent use oral contraceptive pill daily hormonal method contraceptive implant injection ] ( must start 1 month prior receive first dose study agent ) Diaphragm cervical cap Intrauterine device ( IUD ) Male partner vasectomy During study , participant becomes pregnant suspect pregnant , inform study staff primary care physician immediately . The study medication stop immediately CC11050 refer high risk pregnancy specialist follow study team remainder pregnancy rest study , whichever occurs later . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Body mass index ( BMI ) less equal 18.5 kg/m2 2 . Protease inhibitorbased ART regimen 3 . ART regimen include Cobicistat 4 . Absence alternate available ART option case virologic failure 5 . Serum ALT AST value Grade &gt; 2 total bilirubin great ULN unless indirect due Gilbert disease 6 . History chronic hepatitis B ( +HbsAg +HBV DNA plasma ) and/or C treat chronic hepatitis C SVR &gt; 2 year accept . 7 . Cirrhosis liver , know active chronic liver disease 8 . Recent history ( &lt; 30 day ) infection require inpatient hospitalization systemic therapy 9 . Depression . Patients report depression , suspect know depression stable antidepressant undergo Psychiatry evaluation clinical assessment determine eligibility . These assesments do psychiatrist may include : Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , Spielberger StateTrait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) . The BDI , STAI , MoCA administer patient consider study enrollment . The BDI STAI may repeat least followup visit deem eligible participate . 10 . Current breastfeed 11 . Current anticipate treatment immunomodulating agent ( systemic corticosteroid , interleukin , interferon ) agent know antiHIV activity ( antiretrovirals approve use treatment HIV ) 12 . Any experimental medication within 4 week prior screen anticipate use medication trial . 13 . Current ( 4 week prior first dose study drug , ) anticipate use antimetabolites ; alkylating agent ; drug ART , herbal preparation ( include St. John wort ) , food ( include grapefruit ) know affect activity CYP3A4 enzyme pathway 14 . Use thalidomide , lenalidomide , pomalidomide , systemic corticosteroid within 4 week screen 15 . Any prior history PDE4 inhibitor use 16 .
