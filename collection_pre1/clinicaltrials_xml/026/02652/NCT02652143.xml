	<brief_title>Does Vivo Culture Pre-cleavage Stage Embryo Reduce Incidence Aneuploidy ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As soon first minute fertilization process , important biological event , critical future developmental competency embryo take place . These biological event , sperm cell entry oocyte cytoplasm prior first cleavage , include : completion meiosis , exclusion second polar body , pronuclei formation , replication male female DNA chromosome segregation newly form mitotic spindle . If event aberrant , one two daughter cell descendant may carry chromosomal anomaly . In word uneven first cleavage size content associate chromosomal abnormality aneuploidy . In vivo event occur natural environment presence specific molecule dynamic physiological environment might advantage vitro culture condition ensure optimal cellular function . Preliminary data pilot study show high proportion euploid embryo sibling oocyte culture vivo vs. vitro . Moreover , animal model , vivo culture embryos describe significant reduction aneuploidy difference gene expression level pattern compare vitro culture embryo . There also grow evidence culture condition human pre-implantation embryo affect gene expression regulation measurable effect embryos newborn child . The investigator hypothesis vivo produce embryos might high percentage euploidy compare sibling culture vitro .</detailed_description>
