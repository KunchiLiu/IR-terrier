	<brief_summary>Between 2008 2012 investigator perform single-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial ass efficacy local injection two different dos methylprednisolone ( 80 mg 40 mg ) patient carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) , age 18 70 year , previously treat steroid injection . The primary outcome change CTS symptom severity score 10 week rate carpal tunnel release surgery study hand 1 year . In trial 111 patient randomize ( 37 3 group : 80 mg methylprednisolone , 40 mg methylprednisolone placebo ) complete 1-year follow-up . The investiators plan extend follow-up 5 7 year injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Extended follow-up protocol : All 111 trial participant contact telephone researcher give information extend follow-up . A questionnaire together write information consent form send mail . The questionnaire consist CTS symptom severity sale , 11-item DASH scale , bodily pain scale , treatment satisfaction visual analog scale ( VAS ) , use previous follow-up evaluation . The questionnaire also include 6-item CTS symptom scale ( CTS-6 ) palmar pain scale . The patient ask whether undergone carpal tunnel release surgery study hand receive injection within trial . Patients ' record review verify data subsequent surgery study hand . The Chi-square test use compare 80-mg methylprednisolone group placebo group regard proportion patient carpal tunnel release surgery study hand within 5 year injection ( primary outcome ) . The change symptom severity score patient 80-mg methylprednisolone group surgery study hand injection compare change symptom severity score patient surgery study hand methylprednisolone injection ( co-primary outcome ) use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) adjust sex , age , dominance study hand baseline symptom severity score . A similar comparison make 11-item DASH bodily pain score . The palmar pain score 5 7 year compare group use independent-samples t-test also ANCOVA adjust sex , age dominance study hand . Patients surgery methylprednisolone injection compare patient surgery placebo injection regard change baseline 5 7 year symptom severity score , 11-item DASH scale score , bodily pain score satisfaction score use ANCOVA adjust sex , age , dominance study hand respective baseline score . To identify potential predictive factor long-term benefit 80 mg methylprednisolone injection , surgery within 5 year analyze accord variable sex , age , dominance study hand , baseline symptom severity score ( â‰¥3 versus &lt; 3 ) baseline median nerve conduction abnormality ( severe/moderate v mild/normal ) . All statistical test 2-sided p value le 0.05 indicate statistical significance .</detailed_description>
