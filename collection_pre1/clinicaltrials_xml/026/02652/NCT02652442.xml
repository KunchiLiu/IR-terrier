	<brief_summary>Recent study suggest otolith dysfunction common finding individual history head trauma/blast exposure and/or noise-induced hearing loss . Therefore , otolith dysfunction may significant health concern Veteran population , determine optimal intervention strategy otolith dysfunction important VA healthcare . The purpose project compare effectiveness standard vestibular rehabilitation compare novel treatment approach , centrifugation , treatment individual otolith dysfunction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vestibular Rehabilitation Otolith Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary function vestibular ( inner ear balance ) system maintain gaze postural stability . The vestibular system comprise two type sensory organ ( semicircular canal otolith organ ) unique contribution balance . Vestibular Rehabilitation ( VR ) treatment choice patient experience dizziness , imbalance , mobility impairment related vestibular dysfunction . VR typically include gaze stability exercise , gait balance training , general conditioning . Gaze stability exercise develop base concept adaptation substitution goal improve gaze stability facilitate vestibular compensation semicircular canal-mediated vestibulo-ocular reflex ( VOR ) . Many factor might influence recovery , involvement different vestibular sensory organ ( semicircular canal versus otolith organ ) examine determine impact recovery . Most study examine effectiveness VR use test VOR function ( caloric rotational test ) measure hSCC determine vestibular loss . Thus , little known intervention facilitate vestibular compensation otolith organ . Recent study demonstrate adaptation follow otolith organ stimulation use centrifugation ( linear acceleration ) . The concept use centrifugation otolith adaptation may similar use gaze stability exercise VOR adaptation . Participants dizziness/imbalance relate otolith dysfunction randomize receive stag intervention either gaze stability exercise ( n=14 ) centrifugation ( n=14 ) follow balance rehabilitation . Providing intervention stage allow isolation key component vestibular rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
