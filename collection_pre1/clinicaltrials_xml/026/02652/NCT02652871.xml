	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn safety LY2510924 combination cytarabine idarubicin patient relapse refractory AML . We also study LY2510924 combination cytarabine idarubicin help control relapse refractory AML . LY2510924 design help cancer cell move bone marrow bloodstream , expose chemotherapy ( case , cytarabine idarubicin ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LY2510924 , Idarubicin Cytarabine Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 3 participant enrol Dose Escalation part study , 18 participant enrol Dose Expansion part study . If enrol Dose Escalation part study , dose LY2510924 receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level LY2510924 . Each new group receive high dose LY2510924 group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose LY2510924 find . If enrol Dose Expansion part study , receive LY2510924 high dose tolerate Dose Expansion part study . All participant also receive idarubicin cytarabine . Your dose level assign base age . Study Drug Administration : Treatment study give 2 phase : Induction Consolidation . Each phase make 28-day study cycle . Induction Phase : You receive 1-2 cycle Induction phase . During Cycle 1 , admit inpatient Leukemia service receive study drug . You receive LY2510924 alone day 7 day together chemotherapy Days 8 , 9 10 also Day 11 age 60 , every 28-day cycle . - On day receive idarubicin/cytarabine , LY2510924 give injection skin 8:00 ( +/- 1½ hour ) . - On day receive idarubicin/cytarabine , give 4 hour ( +/- ½ hour ) receive idarubicin . On Days 8 9 , addition LY2510924 : - You receive idarubicin vein 1 hour . - You receive cytarabine vein 24 hour . On Day 10 , addition LY2510924 : - You receive cytarabine vein 24 hour . - If age 60 , receive idarubicin vein 1 hour . If age 60 , Day 11 , addition LY2510924 , receive cytarabine vein 24 hour . On day receive cytarabine infusion , receive drug help reduce risk side effect . You receive dexamethasone cytarabine infusion vein 30 minute . You also receive corticosteroid-containing eye drop time 2 day follow last dose cytarabine . If disease respond Cycle 1 , may allow receive additional Induction cycle , also call Cycle 1.If respond Induction , move Consolidation phase . Consolidation Phase : If benefit treatment , may continue Consolidation therapy additional 4-6 cycle . During cycle , receive LY2510924 way earlier cycle , 3 day chemotherapy . During Consolidation , participant receive idarubicin vein 1 hour Days 1 2 , cytarabine vein 24 hour Days 1-3 . Study Visits : During Days 1-12 Cycle 1 ( age 60 , Days 1-10 ) , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Days 1-7 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw 4 hour injection LY2510924 routine test . On Days 8 28 Cycle 1 , bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . After Day 11 Cycle 1 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw every 2-4 day routine test . Every 1-2 week Cycles 2-6 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 2-4 week Cycles 2-6 , physical exam . After Cycles 4 6 , bone marrow biopsy aspiration check status disease . You also EKG either ECHO MUGA scan . Any time doctor think need , additional blood test . Length Study : You may receive 8 cycle study drug . You take study disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , study doctor think best interest . Your participation study complete End-of-Treatment Visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 30 day ( +/- 5 day ) last dose study drug , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Long Term Follow-up : Every 2-3 month 2 year stop receive study drug , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This perform local doctor 's office . You also bone marrow aspiration/biopsy every 3 month first year , doctor think best interest . If test show abnormal result , return study clinic follow-up testing . This investigational study . LY2510924 FDA approve commercially available . Its use study investigational . Cytarabine idarubicin approve treat certain type leukemia . Their use study combination LY2510924 investigational . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
