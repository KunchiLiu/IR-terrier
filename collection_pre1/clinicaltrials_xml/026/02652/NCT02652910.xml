	<brief_summary>The goal clinical trial study approach manufacture chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) -modified T ( CAR-T ) cell affect vivo persistence therapeutic efficacy B lymphoma . Recently , cancer immunotherapy , treatment aim arm patient immunity specifically cancer cell , emerge promising therapeutic strategy . Among many emerge immunotherapeutic approach , clinical trial utilize CARs B cell malignancy demonstrate remarkable potential . CARs combine variable region antibody T-cell signal moiety confer T-cell activation target specificity antibody . Thus , CARs MHC-restricted vulnerable MHC regulation tumor . However , define activation contraction program mother cell , persistency function CAR-T cell also restrict protocol manufacturing . Previous clinical study largely utilized interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) ex vivo expansion CAR-T cell , preferentially generate CAR-T cell characteristic terminally differentiate effector cell . Our preliminary data indicate two common gamma chain cytokine , IL-7 IL-15 , help selectively expand CAR-T cell various memory phenotype . CAR-T Cells prepared condition result improved therapeutic efficacy preclinical animal model . This clinical investigation test hypothesis whether IL-7/IL-15-programmed anti-CD19 CAR-T cell persist longer lymphoma patient infusion whether persistency CAR-T cell lead improve anti-lymphoma efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1 . To determine safety feasibility CD19.CAR-T cell manufacture IL-7/IL-15-mediated expansion IL-2-mediated expansion 2 . To determine vivo dynamic persistency IL-7/IL-15 program CD19.CAR-T cell . 3 . To determine efficacy IL-7/IL-15 program CD19.CAR-T cell treat patient CD19-positive lymphoma Secondary Objectives 1 . To determine whether IL-7/IL-15 program CD19.CAR-T cell superior IL-2 program cell measure vivo persistence post infusion 2 . To determine whether IL-7/IL-15 program CD19.CAR-T cell superior IL-2 program cell measure efficacy lymphoma therapy 3 . To assess dynamic intratumoral infiltration CD19.CAR-T cell . 4 . To correlate subset differentiation CD19.CAR-T cell observe anti-tumor efficacy</detailed_description>
