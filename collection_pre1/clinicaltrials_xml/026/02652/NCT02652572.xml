	<brief_title>Safety Study Examine Systemic Exposure Granexin® Gel After Topical Application Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study ascertain systemic exposure active ingredient Granexin® gel ( aCT1 peptide ) topical application venous leg ulcer use pharmacokinetic analysis . It plan total 16 patient venous leg ulcer receive Granexin® gel treatment plus standard care one arm study . The study include screening period ( 1 week ) treatment period ( 1 week ) occur sequentially give patient.The baseline day , demarcate begin treatment period , designate Day 0 . Screening procedure initially conduct Day -7 . A target venous leg ulcer identify screen patient eligibility confirm screen begin Day 0 ( baseline ) visit . A patient enrol study may multiple ulcer either leg ; case , ulcer treat Granexin® gel , ulcer ( ) meeting follow criterion designate target ulcer ( ) determine eligibility : &gt; 15cm2 least 4 week duration post debridement . The treatment period give patient begin Day 0 end one week later ; last scheduled day treatment period designate Day 7 . During treatment period , patient schedule receive topical treatment study drug gel ( 3 application total ) administer study staff schedule study site visit follow time point : Day 0 , Day 3 , Day 7 . All patient , regardless treatment assignment , also receive standard-of-care treatment schedule study visit treatment period . Study drug pre-application blood sample collect patient Day 0 , Day 3 , Day 7 . Study drug post-application blood sample collect Day 0 Day 7 time point specify protocol . These blood sample ship designated laboratory pharmacokinetic analysis . Safety assess treatment period monitor adverse event , measure vital sign visit , perform physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , well pharmacokinetic ( PK ) blood analysis .</detailed_description>

Designated venous leg ulcer meet follow criterion screen baseline visit . If patient multiple ulcer , least one ulcer must meet follow criterion screen baseline visit : 1 . Present least 4 week 2 . CEAP Classification Stage 6 3 . Surface ulcer area &gt; 15cm2 post debridement 4 . Viable , granulate wound ( investigator discretion ) 4 . Ulcers extend epidermis muscle , tendon , bone ( Stage II III ulcer define IAET ) . 5 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening must agree use hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence throughout 2 week last administration study drug 6 . Signed informed consent 1 . Decrease size designate target ulcer ( ) ≥ 30 % 7day screening period 2 . Can tolerate comply compression therapy . 3 . An ulcer show sign severe clinical infection , define pu ooze ulcer site 4 . An ulcer positive βhemolytic streptococci upon culture 5 . The ulcer &gt; 50 % slough , significant necrotic tissue , bone , tendon , capsule exposure avascular ulcer bed 6 . Is highly exude ( i.e . require daily change dress ) 7 . Ankle brachial pressure index &lt; 0.65 8 . Patients active systemic infection 9 . Patients clinically significant medical condition determine investigator include renal , hepatic , hematologic , neurologic immune disease . Examples include limited : 1 . Renal insufficiency estimate GFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.7m2 2 . Abnormal blood biochemistry define 3 time upper limit normal range . 3 . Hepatic insufficiency define total bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL serum albumin &lt; 25 g/L 4 . HbA1c &gt; 9 % 5 . Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL 6 . Hematocrit &lt; 0.30 7 . Platelet count &lt; 100,000 10 . Presence active systemic local cancer tumor kind ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer ) 11 . Patients severe rheumatoid arthritis ( 20 persistently inflamed joint , low normal limit blood albumin level , evidence bone cartilage damage xray , inflammation tissue joint ) collagen vascular disease . 12 . Patients active connective tissue disease 13 . Treatment systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 15 mg/day ) , current immunosuppressive agent 14 . Previous current radiation therapy likelihood receive therapy study participation 15 . Pregnant nursing patient 16 . Known prior inability unavailability complete require study visit study participation 17 . Significant peripheral edema per investigator 's discretion 18 . A psychiatric condition ( e.g. , suicidal ideation ) chronic alcohol drug abuse problem , determine patient 's medical history , , opinion investigator , may pose threat patient compliance 19 . Use plateletderived growth factor within 28 day screen 20 . Use investigational drug therapy within 28 day screen 21 .
