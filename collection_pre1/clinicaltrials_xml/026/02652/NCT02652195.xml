	<detailed_description>Oxytocin well-known social reproductive hormone demonstrate variety prosocial effect human include enhance trust generosity , improve positive communication , increase eye gaze , reduce anxiety . Oxytocin hypothesize facilitate social behavior via modulation motivational network . With study , investigator characterize oxytocin 's effect neural process salient stimulus . The investigator utilize noninvasive brain imaging technique , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , assess brain activity participant perform test design engage neural circuit associate process social non-social stimulus . Ongoing clinical trial examine use intranasal oxytocin treatment multiple psychiatric disorder include substance dependence , depression , schizophrenia ; disorder reward system dysfunction appear play significant role . As , important obtain good understand neurobiological effect drug may reward circuitry function . To end , study , examine healthy control participant participant diagnose Alcohol Use Disorder ( AUD ) .</detailed_description>
