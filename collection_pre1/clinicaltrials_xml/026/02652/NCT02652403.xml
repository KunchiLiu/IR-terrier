	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness simplify technique conventional denture fabrication , compare traditional technique , evaluate impact oral health quality life , satisfaction individual chew efficiency well assess quality prosthetics TMD . Furthermore , cost involved manufacture dentures technique simplify compare cost involve traditional technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simplified Versus Conventional Technique Complete Denture Fabrication .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The traditional technique conduct protocol use dental school Brazil describe clinical trial conventional technique dentures fabrication . On simplified technical functional mold step delete , thus orientation plane make directly result model initial mold alginate , mount model perform semiadjustable articulator random aid auxiliary table 15 degree semiadjustable articulator fix slope . To evaluate impact oral health quality life individual use Brazilian version Oral Health Impact Profile edentulous patient ( OHIP-Edent ) evaluation patient satisfaction use specific questionnaire assess quality prosthesis carry specific exam , assess presence TMD , subject evaluate RDC / TMD , assess efficiency masticatory chew capsule use , cost involve manufacture prosthesis calculate accord material consumption use make prosthesis . All subject assess make prosthesis 90 day installation new denture period hold regular control visit . The data evaluate order descriptive number proportion , moreover , statistically evaluate mean suitable test .</detailed_description>
