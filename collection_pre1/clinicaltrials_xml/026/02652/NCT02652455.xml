Patients ocular mucosal metastatic melanoma may include , prior experience indicate TIL successfully propagate subtypes melanoma metastasis . Must anticipate residual measurable disease resection target lesion ( ) TIL growth . Patients previously treat metastatic melanoma may include ( e.g. , prior treatment Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma ( BRAF ) inhibitor and/or ipilimumab allow ) , provide three week 'washout ' prior sign consent treat Programmed Death1 ( PD1 ) block antibody . Age great equal 18 year . Clinical performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 1 .

At screening , patient ≤ 3 CNS metastasis ≤ 1 cm size treat either surgical resection and/or radiation therapy may include . Patients may include large lesion ≤ 1 cm , evidence progressive CNS disease brain image least 30 day definitive treatment , patient CNS metastases take prednisone &gt; 10 mg equivalent daily . At screening , patient &gt; 1 cm &gt; 3 number treat CNS metastasis may include evidence progressive CNS disease brain image least 90 day treatment surgery and/or radiation therapy , patient CNS metastases take prednisone &gt; 10 mg equivalent daily . Patients active systemic infection require intravenous antibiotic , coagulation disorder , major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system , opinion PI treat coinvestigator acceptable risk ACT , exclude . Patients receive prior immunotherapy whose side effect result requirement immunosuppressive medication ( &gt; 10 mg prednisone daily equivalent daily steroid daily , infliximab , cyclosporine equivalent immunosuppressive medication ) autoimmune condition require immunosuppressive medication time screen exclude .
