	<criteria>Selection Criteria : Subjects must meet follow criterion Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) order include study . 1 . Age 18 year old . 2 . Onset vision loss base medically documented history subject testimony , least one eye ≤180 day duration eye affect duration vision loss eye must ≤180 day duration . 3 . Each eye subject maintain visual ability allow least count examiner 's finger distance . 4 . Female subject ( childbearing potential ) must agree use effective method birth control 6 month IVT injection male subject must agree use condom 6 month IVT injection . 5 . Ability obtain adequate pupillary dilation permit thorough ocular examination test . 6 . Signed write informed consent . Subjects include study must satisfy follow criterion Inclusion Visit ( Visit 2 ) . 1 . Documented result genotyping show presence G11778A mutation ND4 gene absence primary LHONassociated mutation ( ND1 ND6 ) subject 's mitochondrial DNA . 2. Review selection criterion ensure continue compliance . 3 . Have negative test infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 4 . Have negative pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ( woman two year postmenopausal surgically sterile consider childbearing potential ) . NonSelection Criteria : Subjects meet least one follow criterion Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) include study . 1 . Any known allergy hypersensitivity GS010 constituent . 2 . Contraindication IVT injection . 3 . IVT drug delivery either eye within 30 day prior Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) . 4 . Previous vitrectomy either eye . 5 . Narrow angle either eye contraindicating pupillary dilation . 6 . Presence disorder ocular medium , cornea lens , may interfere visual acuity ocular assessment study period . 7 . Vision disorder , LHON , involve visual disability potential cause vision loss trial period . 8 . Causes optic neuropathy LHON glaucoma . 9 . Subjects know mutation gene involve pathological retinal optic nerve condition . 10 . Presence ocular systemic disease , LHON , whose pathology associate treatment might affect retina optic nerve . 11 . History amblyopia associate Snellen visual acuity equivalent bad 20/80 ( equivalent 6/24 6 meter , decimal acuity 0.25 , LogMAR +0.6 ) affect eye . 12 . Presence ocular condition , opinion Investigator prevent good quality SDOCT imaging obtain . 13 . Presence , either eye , uncontrolled glaucoma , define IOP great 25 mmHg , despite maximal medical therapy IOPlowering agent . 14 . Active ocular inflammation history idiopathic autoimmuneassociated uveitis . 15 . Subjects participate another clinical trial receive IMP within 90 day prior Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) . 16 . Previous treatment ocular gene therapy product . 17 . Subjects undergone ocular surgery clinical relevance ( per Investigator opinion ) within 90 day precede Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) . 18 . Female Subjects intend breast feed trial period . Subjects meet least one follow criterion Inclusion Visit ( Visit 2 ) include study . 1 . Any nonselection criterion may appear screen visit . 2 . Subjects take idebenone completely discontinue idebenone least 7 day prior Visit 2 . If subject discontinue idebenone least 7 day prior Visit 2 , visit may delay 7day period complete . 3 . Presence , time study inclusion , infectious conjunctivitis , keratitis , scleritis endophthalmitis either eye . 4 . Presence systemic illness , include alcohol drug abuse ( except nicotine ) , medically significant abnormal laboratory value deem Investigator preclude subject 's safe participation study . 5 . Presence illness disease , opinion Investigator , include symptom and/or associate treatment alter visual function , instance cancer pathology central nervous system . 6 . Any medical psychological condition , opinion Investigator , may compromise safe participation subject study would preclude compliance study protocol ability subject successfully complete study . 7 . Subjects unable unwilling comply protocol requirement .</criteria>
