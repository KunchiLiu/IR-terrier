	<brief_title>Safety Study Examine Systemic Exposure Granexin® Gel After Topical Application Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study ascertain systemic exposure active ingredient Granexin® gel ( aCT1 peptide ) topical application diabetic foot ulcer use pharmacokinetic analysis . It plan total 16 patient diabetic foot ulcer receive Granexin® gel treatment plus standard care one arm study . The study include screening period ( 1 week ) treatment period ( 1 week ) occur sequentially give patient . The baseline day , demarcate begin treatment period , designate Day 0 . Screening procedure initially conduct Day -7 . A target foot ulcer identify screen patient eligibility confirm screen begin Day 0 ( baseline ) visit . A patient enrol study may multiple ulcer either foot ; case , ulcer treat Granexin® gel , ulcer ( ) meeting follow criterion designate target ulcer ( ) determine eligibility : &gt; 4cm2 post debridement least 4 week duration . The treatment period give patient begin Day 0 end one week later ; last scheduled day treatment period designate Day 7 . During treatment period , patient schedule receive topical treatment study drug gel ( 3 application total ) administer study staff schedule study site visit follow time point : Day 0 , Day 3 , Day 7 . All patient , regardless treatment assignment , also receive standard-of-care treatment schedule study visit treatment period . Study drug pre-application blood sample collect patient Day 0 , Day 3 , Day 7 . Study drug post-application blood sample collect Day 0 Day 7 time point specify protocol . These blood sample ship designated laboratory pharmacokinetic analysis . Safety assess treatment period monitor adverse event , measure vital sign visit , perform physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , well pharmacokinetic ( PK ) blood analysis .</detailed_description>
