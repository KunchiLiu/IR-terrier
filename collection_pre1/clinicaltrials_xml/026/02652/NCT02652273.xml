	<brief_title>Inhibition Co-Stimulation Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic inflammatory immune mediate arthritis lead pain , swell destruction joint . RA affect 500,000 subject United Kingdom ( UK ) incur significant health economic cost . Most patient require potent immune suppress drug methotrexate , help reduce pain stiffness , protect joint damage . However , many patient respond unable tolerate methotrexate . In patient , biologic drug abatacept use try control arthritis . Abatacept design target inhibit specific molecule involve `` costimulation '' inflammatory signal thought important RA . While abatacept show effective trial clinical practice , exact mechanism action abatacept RA fully elucidate . Understanding action likely inform use abatacept RA lead increase understanding inflammation human implication therapy . This six month prospective open label study , therefore , aim investigate effect inhibit costimulation variety important inflammatory cell type process human RA . 25 participant RA bad prognostic genetic marker ( Anti-citrullinated protein antibody ( ACPA ) human leukocyte antigen ( HLADR4 ) schedule receive subcutaneous abatacept part standard clinical treatment recruit . Consenting participant follow total 24 week time additional venous blood urine sample take investigate effect abatacept immune cell system . The primary endpoint study characterisation immune response follow costimulatory modulation RA patient 12 week . Secondary endpoint include change immunological response association clinical outcome measure 24 week .</detailed_description>
