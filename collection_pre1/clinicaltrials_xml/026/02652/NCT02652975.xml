	<detailed_description>1 . Background During past 30 year , survival breast cancer patient improve substantially due early diagnosis , improved surgical technique , introduction new combination chemotherapy , new hormonal treatment , introduction target treatment , refinement radiation technique . With increase number cancer survivor , part reach aggressive treatment , attention presently draw long-term consequence curative cancer treatment . Comorbidity among breast cancer patient thoroughly study past year . Previous research however , primarily focus prevalence comorbidity time cancer diagnosis ( manifest comorbidity ) less attention pay study latent comorbidity develop diagnosis , result treatment . Furthermore know incidence later developed comorbidity different breast cancer patient compare general population . Additionally , study address specific disease focus comorbidity . Emerging evidence , however , indicate cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) ( encompass cerebrovascular disease manifest stroke TCI coronary heart disease manifest infarction , arrhythmia , heart failure sudden death ) diabetes may play pivotal role , contribute importantly total mortality breast cancer specific mortality among breast cancer survivor . Comorbidity breast cancer diagnosis independent adverse prognostic factor . In Denmark , comorbidity present 26 % breast cancer patient diagnose 2006-2008 , presence comorbidity increase risk die breast cancer well cause adjust hazard ratio all-cause mortality 1.45 breast cancer-specific mortality 1.30 . Most study , however , use summary measure comorbidity Charlson Comorbidity Index Score , study assess individual effect specific comorbidities mortality among breast cancer patient . These study universally demonstrate CVD diabetes associate decreased overall survival . Thus , Patnaik et al show among breast cancer patient , woman follow comorbidities likely die result cause : CVD ( 59.2 % ) , COPD ( 52.2 % ) , diabetes ( 47.8 % ) previous cancer ( 43.8 % ) Fully adjust relative hazard effect comorbidities breast cancer-specific mortality 1.24 CVD 1.10 diabetes , among total study population breast cancer patient , CVD primary cause death ( 15.9 % ) , follow closely breast cancer ( 15.1 % ) . In meta-analysis study overall survival breast cancer patient preexist diabetes , Barone et al find preexist diabetes associate increased mortality hazard rate ( HR ) 1.61 ; ( 95 % CI , 1.46-1.78 ) . Metabolic syndrome ( MS ) cluster disorder include hypertension , type II diabetes , dyslipidemia obesity , certain aspect MS well describe relation breast cancer . It show obesity associate increase risk develop breast cancer among postmenopausal woman , obese patient present advanced cancer , woman overweight obese time breast cancer diagnosis gain weight diagnosis increase risk cancer recurrence death compare lean woman . One study show effect adjuvant therapy less obese breast cancer patient . An association diabetes breast cancer also observe . Other component MS , include low HDL-cholesterol , high triglyceride , hypertension , serum testosterone , however , less well describe , may associate increase breast cancer risk bad breast cancer prognosis . A recent study show patient MS present aggressive tumor . In patient metastatic disease , response chemotherapy appear inferior patient diagnose MS , well . Emerging evidence suggest MS may quite prevalent among patient breast cancer . In study metabolic syndrome define accordance definition National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) /Adult Treatment Panel III ( ATPIII ) . A diabetic FPG level define FPG &gt; 7 mmol/l ; impaired fasting glycemia define FPG 6.1 7.0 mmol/l accord World Health Organization criterion . Endothelial cell line internal lumen vasculature serve interface circulate blood vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMCs ) . Apart key participant process angiogenesis , dynamic structure actively regulate basal vascular tone vascular reactivity physiological pathological condition . They respond mechanical force neurohumoral mediator release variety relax contract factor nitric oxide ( NO ) prostacyclin . The balance vasodilatation vasoconstriction maintain endothelium , disruption balance lead endothelial dysfunction cause damage arterial wall . Endothelial cell also responsible maintenance blood fluidity restoration vessel wall integrity ( injure ) avoid bleeding . Endothelial cell-derived factor also critical mediator VSMC growth inflammation . Several cytotoxic regimen show cause endothelial cell damage vascular toxicity various mechanism . Thus , anthracyclines taxanes ( form cornerstone breast cancer treatment ) together cytotoxics alkylating agent , bleomycin , vinca alkaloid antimetabolite associate endothelial cell apoptosis , oxidative stress , inflammation , coagulation disorders/thrombotic state , endothelial cell proliferation-migration , effect VEGF , impair endothelial-dependent vasodilation vitro vivo , although exact mechanism know . Changes endothelial function hasten development micro- macro-angiopathy endothelial dysfunction important surrogate marker atherosclerotic activity . Endothelial dysfunction implicate pathogenesis clinical course know cardiovascular disease associate future risk adverse cardiovascular event . Endothelial dysfunction closely related MS , deficiency endothelial-derived NO believe primary defect link insulin resistance endothelial dysfunction . It know whether worsen endothelial dysfunction aggravate element MS. 2 . Objective The aim research program study change endothelial function metabolic parameter patient receive chemotherapy early stage breast cancer , compare parameter healthy age match control . Our theory cytotoxic therapy induce endothelial cell damage vascular toxicity cause endothelial dysfunction . The investigator believe endothelial dysfunction mediator MS predispose later cardiovascular disease , thus render patient receive cytotoxic therapy risk condition . The investigator hypothesize : 1 . Cytotoxic therapy induce endothelial dysfunction predispose early breast cancer patient . 2 . Metabolic syndrome may aggravate cytotoxic therapy , possibly worsen endothelial dysfunction . 3 . Treatment early breast cancer ( chemotherapy , antihormonal therapy and/or trastuzumab ) aggravate preexist CVD and/or metabolic disease may induce metabolic syndrome . 3 ) Methods The study clinical case-control study inclusion 90 patient divide 3 group state . 30 healthy woman age participate control ( group 4 ) . Group 1 : Newly diagnose patient early breast cancer . Investigated immediately prior start adjuvant therapy . Group 2 : Early breast cancer patient , receive standard treatment . Investigated immediately completion adjuvant chemotherapy . Group 3 : Early breast cancer patient , receive standard treatment . Investigated 1 year complete chemotherapy . Group 4 : Healthy , age-matched control . Controls recruit internet resource ( www.forsoegsperson.dk ) : The test program consist follow investigation : 1 . To characterize endothelial function vivo effect vasodilatating substance measure forearm circuit . The substance administer via thin catheter place Brachial artery near elbow local anesthesia . Once vessels dilate , blood flow forearm increase flow change measure vasodilatory capacity substance . The change measure classical venous occlusion plethysmography . The method describe establish Aarhus University Hospital use several decade illustrate effect vasoactive drug human circulation , mean proven well document method . 2 . Applanation tonometry ( pulse wave velocity central blood pressure/arterial stiffness ) : The central blood pressure augmentation index estimate shape radial pulse wave measure tonometer . Pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) calculate average difference pulse pressure wave measure tonometer R ECG record simultaneously . 3 . Medical history : A full medical history include use medication obtain every subject . Age , smoke status concurrent medication . For patient tumor characteristic anticancer treatment also describe . 4 . Clinical examination : A regular objective examination perform include weight , height ( BMI ) measurement hip waist circumference . 5 . Measurements body composition : Total body fat fat free mass measure Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) . 6 . Electrocardiography : A conventional 12 lead surface electrocardiogram record . 7 . 24 hour blood pressure measurement 8 . Laboratory test : Fasting blood test draw antecubital place catheter ( albumin , ALAT/ASAT , alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin , gammaglutamyl transferase , coagulation factor , red white blood cell , creatinin , potassium , sodium , fast lipid , fast glucose , hemoglobin A1C , insulin , sex hormone , von Willebrand factor , low grade inflammation marker , DNA RNA later analyse , include relevant coding gene ) . Further urine sample determine possible systemic impact cardiovascular disease . The investigator create biobank contain urine blood sample participant future research , provide participant give permission . Responsibility biobank lie project responsible physician , Anders Bonde Jensen . 9 . To characterize overall risk cardiovascular death within 10 year , investigator use well- establish validated method call SCORE use age , gender , smoke status , systolic blood pressure plasma cholesterol risk stratification . 10 . Every premenopausal woman ask possibility pregnant . In case doubt investigator pregnancy test ( urine hcg )</detailed_description>
