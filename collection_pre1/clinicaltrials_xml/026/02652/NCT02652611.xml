	<brief_title>Sacroiliac ( SI ) Screws : The Effect SI Screw Removal Patient-Reported Pain Functional Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many surgeon remember patient whose intractable , hardly explainable local symptom complaint pain resolved quickly hardware-removal procedure . However , implant removal require second surgical procedure scar tissue , pose risk nerve damage , infection re-fractures , guarantee pain relief . Rates implant removal vary base anatomic location implant selection . Many study introduce assessed outcome hardware removal ankle , tibia femur . But , currently control trial assess benefit harm sacroiliac ( SI ) screw removal pelvic fracture patient . Reports literature consistent concern incidence painful hardware outcome pain relief hardware removal . There conflict evidence remove hardware decrease acute pain ankle , tibia , femur fracture need explore effect SI screw removal pelvic fracture patient . The investigator propose prospectively randomize patient pelvic fracture require use SI screw stabilization removal versus non-removal SI screw track group less pain need narcotic pain medication .</detailed_description>
