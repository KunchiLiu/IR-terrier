	<brief_summary>Platelet rich fibrin ( PRF ) new therapy option chronic wound yet unproven therapeutic efficacy . This randomise controlled trial aim provide evidence efficacy PRF monotherapy well growth promote carrier matrix antimicrobial compound . The investigator therefore design four arm trial three PRF arm compare well active comparator . The treatment arm follow : Study arm 1 : PRF amikacin teicoplanin Study arm 2 : PRF placebo ( 0.9 % sodium chloride ) Study arm 3 : PRF PHMB ( polyhexanid ) plus Macrogolol ( Lavasorb® ) Study arm 4 : Acticoat 7® wound dress active control Patients infect chronic wound may include trial . Infection shall diagnose experienced senior infectious disease specialist . Patients untreated peripheral vascular occlusive disease define ABI ( ancle brachial index ) &lt; 0,7 excluded trial patient uncontrolled diabetes mellitus patient receive sufficient treatment diabetic foot syndrome . Any underlying illness treat follow standard care . In case chronic venous insufficiency four-layered compression bandage apply visit tolerate patient . Alternatively compression stocking ( Class III ) permit . This mention `` Disease specific treatment '' protocol . Patients receive treatment 56 day . After 28 56 day wind surface compare baseline . Infection parameter ( c-reactive protein leucocyte count ) measure weekly . Evaluation systemic antimicrobial therapy perform visit . Systemic antimicrobial therapy start discretion senior infectious disease specialist .</brief_summary>
