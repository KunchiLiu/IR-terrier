	<detailed_description>Older people heterogeneous population characterize high interindividual variability . Functional ability ( walk , transfer ... ) use classify individual age ( Lalive d'épinay et al. , 1999 ) three category : independent , frail dependent ( HAS , 2005 ) . Frailty generally consider state precedes dependent status , unlike latter , still reversible ( Fried et al. , 2001 ) . These author propose criterion : physical inactivity ( low level physical activity ) , unintentional weight loss ( 5 % body weight 6 month ) , perceive general fatigue , weakness grip strength ( handgrip ) slow speed walk . Nevertheless , present , objective evaluation method include mobility , balance , muscle strength , endurance cognition necessary . Furthermore , psychological characteristic study frailty indicator , except walk speed . Now , last important lever people adherence physical activity program ( Baert et al. , 2011 ) . In sense , good understand quantify indicator dependence elderly multidisciplinary approach frailty , critical public health issue develop non-drug therapeutic intervention adapt delay institutionalization . The propose study item ( ) characterize functional dimension frailty objective indicator ( b ) put relation cognitive psychosocial characteristic elderly order define individual device care physical activity . To meet objective , necessary include large number people comprehensive evaluation protocol physical , psycho-social cognitive characteristic . The research begin inclusive visit medical doctor . Evaluation begin impedancemetric measurement , follow posturographic evaluation . Then , first phase , patient perform walk test ( e.g. , 6 minute , 10 ) spatiotemporal parameter gait cycle , electromyographic activity different muscle low limb quantify . After walk test , subject receive evaluation strength ankle knee muscle isokinetic dynamometer . During contraction , surface electromyographic activity patient also record . In second phase , subject perform series repetition 50 % maximum voluntary contraction ( MVC ) isokinetic dynamometer , measure strength endurance . Thirdly , participant ask complete cognitive test psychometric questionnaire . Finally , personalize care offer term adapt physical activity . The evaluation protocol perform measure impact physical activity three month first assessment . Through assessment , identify risk protective factor frailty relationship physical activity , evaluate propose appropriate care patient . This study enable production new scientific knowledge improve health quality life old people .</detailed_description>
