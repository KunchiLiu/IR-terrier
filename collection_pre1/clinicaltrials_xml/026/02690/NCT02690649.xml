	<detailed_description>This interventional study design develop patient focused strategy improve adherence anticoagulant medication patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . Outcomes work include novel intervention , well information regard patient preference tailor education . There two phase study . In first phase , investigator use patient-centered approach design build personal health record ( PHR ) -based educational intervention base patient preference content , time delivery mechanism . In second phase , investigator test intervention six-month randomize controlled trial . During development intervention Phase 1 investigator use patient-centered , iterative design process include interview , prototype development test . The investigator recruit diverse group AF patient determine preference information AF anticoagulant therapy . The investigator use user-centered design approach best practice human-computer interaction ( HCI ) determine desire content , timing , delivery tailor education PHR . The investigator build wire-frame model ( low fidelity message prototype ) base focus group finding perform usability test refine intervention design . The intervention component assess impact push tailor health education message patient PHR . The tailored health education specifically aim improve patient compliance anticoagulant therapy . One trigger health education messaging failure take , fill , refill anticoagulant medication prescription - information obtain e-prescribing data feed electronic medical record ( Surescripts ) use smart pill bottle ( AdhereTech - HIPAA compliant , FDA-registered Class I medical device ) send notification real time participant open fail open pill bottle . The intervention trial Phase 2 comprise two group , control experimental . Both control experimental group receive standard care , include access MyChart . In addition standard care , group receive training use MyChart AdhereTech smart pill bottle , medication adherence group monitor Surescripts e-prescribing software AdhereTech smart pill bottle use . The experimental group receive intervention : tailor health messaging deliver via MyChart pertinent AF oral anticoagulant use .</detailed_description>
