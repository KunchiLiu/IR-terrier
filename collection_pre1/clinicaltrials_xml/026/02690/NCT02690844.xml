The use mucoadhesive may help increase surface contact elicit great reduction symptom . Study Design : Randomized , single-blind study perform 3 group ( see treatment arm ) . Randomization perform computer generate randomization randomly allocate patient . The patient aware random group allocation . The study involve assessment three phase , initial examination ( baseline ) , two week treatment , final assessment four week . Treatment Arms : 1 .

Prior inclusion , patient candida infection rule . Laboratory examination perform serum level iron , ferritin , folate , vitamin B12 glucose measure . Any abnormality level lead exclusion . If patient use antidepressant anxiolytic , must least 6 month change dosage . Resting salivary flow rate measure rule patient hyposalivation ( &lt; 0.1ml/min ) . A standardized intra extraoral examination perform rule : lichen planus , benign migratory glossitis mucosal condition . Any clinical indication possible contact sensitivity dental material evaluate patch testing . Treatment Protocol Data Collection : After initial standardized examination meeting inclusion criterion , patient randomly allocate one 3 different group base upon computer generate randomization . Patients fill baseline questionnaire include ( VAS ) Brief Pain Inventory Scale . Patients fill another questionnaire ( question ) two week final time four week . The visual analogue scale line 0-10 marked . Patient indicate scale much pain past week circle number . The Brief Pain Inventory allow u see burn mouth symptom affect patient ' feeling function . Objectives Null Hypotheses Primary objective study follow : - To compare effectiveness clonazepam tablet vs Mucolox® alone vs Mucolox® mixed clonazepam reduce pain intensity report subject primary burn mouth syndrome two four week . - To compare effectiveness clonazepam tablet vs Mucolox® alone vs Mucolox® mixed clonazepam improve patient 's ability function . Null Hypotheses - Mucolox ® mixed clonazepam equally less effective clonazepam tablet reduce burn mouth pain intensity report subject . - Mucolox ® mixed clonazepam equally less effective clonazepam tablet improve patient feeling function report subject . Outcomes The data analyze decrease symptom well improvement feeling function patient compare baseline two week four week .
