	<brief_summary>Gastroscopy ( OGD ) useful test investigate variety suspect upper GI disorder . But uncomfortable patient incur risk intubation sedation , plus large proportion procedure reveal insignificant pathology . Capsule endoscopy ( CE ) investigation choice diseases small bowel . It safe , non-invasive well-tolerated . The use CE traditionally restrict small bowel , although new capsule image oesophagus colon currently use . Previous capsule fail adequately image stomach due ' large volume rugal fold . Recently magnetic capsule handheld magnet developed ( Mirocam Navi , Intromedic Ltd , Seoul , Korea ) enable element manoeuvrability capsule . This unnecessary small bowel capsule propel along ' tubular structure peristalsis , capacious stomach may allow capsule steer examine area stomach . We already conduct two feasibility study porcine model promise result trial already evaluate equipment steer small bowel capsule stomach duodenum . An ongoing study compare ability technique examine stomach conventional OGD , patient recurrent iron deficiency anaemia . The next stop would compare two modality different condition . We wish undertake prospective single blind control trial compare magnetically assist capsule examination conventional OGD diagnose upper gastrointestinal pathology patient gastrointestinal bleeding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intubational endoscopy uncomfortable patient incurs risk bleed , perforation sedation relate complication . Gastroscopy 'gold-standard ' investigation identify upper gastrointestinal pathology poorly tolerate patient . Moreover large proportion gastroscopy normal reveal insignificant pathology despite effort produce pre-procedure score system grade appropriateness procedure , correlation diagnostic yield poor . Capsule endoscopy well tolerate traditionally reserve examination small bowel since manipulate view area capacious stomach . A capsule could overcome steered examine area mucosal surface stomach alternative intubational endoscopy would advantageous patient . Mirocam Navi ( MC1000-WM , Intromedic Ltd , Seoul , Korea ) small bowel capsule endoscope inclusion magnetic material . Available accessory include handheld magnet gain control capsule upper gastrointestinal tract . The capsule CE mark ( CE0120 ) handheld magnet class accessory . In order ass feasibility hypothesis conduct study ex vivo porcine stomach model , commonly use endoscopy training purpose . Different coloured/shaped bead sewn major location stomach ( cardia , fundus , great less curve , anterior posterior wall , antrum D1 ) . The stomach distend 1000mls water . Endoscopy perform accord set protocol . All stomach tag identify 87.2 % ( 41/47 ) examination . This follow double blind , randomise control trial compare magnetically assist capsule endoscopy ( MACE ) conventional upper gastrointestinal endoscopy detect colour bead porcine stomach model . Gastroscopy correctly identify 88 % ( 79/90 ) bead , MACE correctly identify 89 % ( 80/90 ) bead thus noninferior gastroscopy setting ( 95 % CI 82.76 % -95.24 % ) . Mean examination time gastroscopy MACE 3.34 minute 9.90 minute respectively . Clearly significant difference porcine model live human stomach . However , study provide proof principle small bowel capsule endoscope manipulate make targeted movement within stomach . We also one complete human trial assess whether magnetic controller utilised manipulate small bowel capsule stomach duodenum improve completion rate small bowel capsule examination . Another trial also near completion compare diagnostic ability , within stomach , MACE compare conventional gastroscopy context recurrent iron deficiency anaemia . In order develop protocol study , discussion make health professional ( consultant , specialist nurse ward nurse ) involve perform report gastroscopy small bowel capsule endoscopy examination outside research team . Feedback use modify study protocol could patient user friendly possible without compromise overall aim answer research question . Additionally protocol externally peer review subsequent modification make . From porcine two human trial clear obtain reasonable view stomach able guide capsule stomach need distend . In porcine study achieve good result 1000mls water . We felt would acceptable amount patient drink prior magnetically assist capsule endoscopy , two human trial complete date proven excellent tolerance volume water . RECRUITMENT Patients offer information trial time initial clinical encounter outpatient clinic . Written information provide stage follow confirmation consent day , prior , procedure . The research team available patient attends procedure answer question concern . Additionally contact telephone number research team provide patient information sheet concern query . INCLUSION/EXCLUSION We make every effort enable study open wide range patient however currently limit study patient upper gastrointestinal bleeding allow high possibility pathology detection either endoscopic modality hence facilitate comparison diagnostic ability . Specific consideration make ensure patient exclude study delay/interference standard management upper gastroinstinal bleeding . CONSENT All participant consent per study consent form . All member research team formally trained consent procedure assessment capacity . Any participant without capacity consent include trial . The principal investigator train ethical principle underpin informed consent bound principle part good medical practice . RISKS/BURDENS/BENEFITS The participant subject risk procedure gastroscopy small bowel capsule endoscopy . Bleeding perforation major risk undergo gastroscopy occur 0.02 % procedure . There also risk sedation relate complication patient chooses option . The main risk SBCE retention capsule , occur 2 % examination . Since participant undergoing procedure part medical investigation risk discuss patient offer investigation time booking , also formally consent trained individual attend procedure . Participants felt additional risk undergo magnetically steerable capsule examination stomach .</detailed_description>
