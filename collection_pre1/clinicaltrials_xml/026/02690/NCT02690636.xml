	<brief_summary>Breast cancer patient operate modified radical mastectomy breast conservative surgery randomize either adjuvant conventional radiotherapy versus hypofractionated radiotherapy chest wall axilla breast axilla . The patient recruit one year follow 5 year monitor local recurrence , cosmetic outcome , health economic perspective , arm lymph edema .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional Versus Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Node Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize hypofractionated radiotherapy node positive breast cancer equally effective safe conventional fractionate radiotherapy . Breast cancer patient pathological positive lymph node ( N1 - N2 ) operate modified radical mastectomy randomize 1:1 also breast conservative surgery positive lymph node randomize 1:1 receive either adjuvant conventional radiotherapy 200cgy x 25 fraction 200cgy x 5 fraction boost intact breast versus hypofractionated radiotherapy 266cgyx16 fraction 266 cgy x 4 fraction boost intact breast . The patient follow 5 year monitor locoregional recurrence , cosmetic outcome , ipsilateral arm lymph edema . Health economic perspective monitor calculate cost effective analysis treatment plan .</detailed_description>
