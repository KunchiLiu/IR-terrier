	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Pembrolizumab Combination With Gemcitabine Cisplatin Neoadjuvant Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To estimate proportion patient pathological downstaging &lt; pT2 neoadjuvant therapy pembrolizumab administer prior gemcitabine cisplatin patient MIBC Hypothesis : The rate pathologic downstaging &lt; pT2 improve compare historical control Secondary Objectives To estimate proportion patient pT0 neoadjuvant therapy pembrolizumab administer prior gemcitabine cisplatin patient MIBC Hypothesis : The rate pathologic downstaging pT0 improve compare historical control To estimate event free survival ( EFS ) Hypothesis : EFS improve compare historical control To estimate overall survival ( OS ) Hypothesis : OS improve compare historical control To estimate proportion patient alive 3 year ( OS 3 year ) Hypothesis : OS 3 year improve compare historical control To characterize toxicity profile combination pembrolizumab , gemcitabine , cisplatin Hypothesis : Pembrolizumab , gemcitabine , cisplatin safe combination acceptable toxicity rate Exploratory Objectives To explore association biological marker include PD-L1 expression immune gene expression signatures pathological downstaging &lt; pT2 , pT0 , EFS , OS To explore association BASE47 `` basal , '' `` claudin-low , '' `` luminal '' subtypes MIBC pathological downstaging &lt; pT2 , pT0 , EFS , OS To characterize change phenotype TILs , include delineation effector regulatory T cell , neoadjuvant treatment To define T cell receptor ( TCR ) B cell receptor ( BCR ) repertoire profile associate pathological downstaging &lt; pT2 , pT0 , EFS , OS First participant receive dose pembrolizumab alone . Two week dose , s/he receive 3 study drug ( pembrolizumab , gemcitabine cisplatin ) first day 3 week `` cycle '' . S/he receive 1 2 drug 8th day cycle . The participant receive study drug 4 cycle total 12 week . Participants follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
