	<brief_title>Bowel Preparation Quality Screening Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The educational intervention consist 2-3 minute video demonstrate video image adequate inadequate bowel prep , review instruction split dose prep administration . This video post YouTube . Group 1 consist 30 subject instruct view video prior begin colonoscopy preparation . Information access YouTube video provide patient endoscopy nurse assessment staff contact patient per standard practice review appointment schedule procedure-day logistics . Group 2 consist 30 subject receive instruction view video . Nursing staff ask grade bowel prep accord Boston Bowel Preparation Scale ( BBPS ) , validate reliable instrument assess quality bowel preparation [ 6 ] . Using BBPS , four point score system apply three broad region colon : right side colon ( include cecum ascend colon ) , transverse section colon ( include hepatic splenic flexure ) , leave side colon ( include descend colon , sigmoid colon , rectum ) . The point assign follow : ( 0 ) , unprepared colon segment , ( 1 ) , portion mucosa colon segment see , ( 2 ) , minor amount residual staining , ( 3 ) , entire mucosa colon segment see well . The three segment score sum total BBPS score , range 0 9 . The maximum BBPS score perfectly clean colon without residual liquid 9 , minimum BBPS score unprepared colon 0 . The endoscopy nurse procedure room score bowel preparation . This protocol employ previously VUMC Endoscopy Lab endoscopy nurse Vanderbilt complete detailed in-service training session use BBPS score system . Prior initiation current study protocol , endoscopy nurse BBPS score system review session ensure continue reliable valid BBPS score . The endoscopy nurse blind whether patient view video .</detailed_description>
