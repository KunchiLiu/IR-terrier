	<brief_summary>The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease : antibody T cell . Antibodies proteins protect body disease cause bacteria toxic substance . Antibodies work bind bacteria substance , stop grow cause bad effect . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include tumor cell cell infect . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer . They show promise , neither alone sufficient cure patient . This study design combine T cell antibody create effective treatment call autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cell target CD30 antigen ( ATLCAR.CD30 ) administration . In previous study , show new gene put T cell increase ability recognize kill cancer cell . The new gene put T cell study make antibody call anti-CD30 . This antibody stick lymphoma cell substance outside cell call CD30 . Anti-CD30 antibody use treat people lymphoma , strong enough cure patient . For study , anti-CD30 antibody change instead float free blood join T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . These CD30 chimeric ( combination ) receptor-activated T cell seem kill tumor , last long body chance fight cancer unknown . The purpose research study establish safe dose ATLCAR.CD30 cell infuse lymphodepleting chemotherapy estimate number patient whose cancer progress two year ATLCAR.CD30 administration . This study also look effect ATLCAR.CD30 cell , include effect patient 's cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective ( Phase Ib portion study ) To establish safe dose ( ie , number cells/m2 ) ATLCAR.CD30 infuse lymphodepletion bendamustine patient CD30+ refractory/relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) Primary Objective ( Phase II portion study ) To estimate 2 year progression free survival ( PFS ) administration ATLCAR.CD30 patient CD30+ refractory/relapsed HL NHL Secondary Objectives To estimate 2 year overall survival ( OS ) administration CAR.CD30 transduce ATL patient CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL NHL To estimate objective response rate define Lugano Classification CAR.CD30 transduce ATL administer patient CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL NHL To estimate duration response administration CAR.CD30 transduce ATL patient CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL NHL To describe adverse event associate CAR.CD30 transduce ATL administer patient CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL NHL To evaluate safety efficacy bendamustine lymphodepleting agent prior infusion CAR.CD30 transduce ATL To measure survival ATLCAR.CD30 vivo To measure patient-reported symptom , physical function , health-related quality life baseline time patient treat CAR.CD30 T cell Primary Endpoint ( Phase Ib ) Toxicity classify grade accord National Cancer Institute 's Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE , version 4.0 ) . Primary Endpoint ( Phase II ) PFS define day ATLCAR.CD30 infusion relapse ( patient document complete response condition chemotherapy ) progression ( patient without complete response condition chemotherapy ) , death result cause per Lugano classification Secondary Endpoints Overall survival measure date administration CAR.CD30 transduce ATL date death The objective response rate define rate complete response ( CR ) + partial response ( PR ) determine Lugano classification The duration response define time documentation tumor response disease progression Toxicity classify grade accord National Cancer Institute 's Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE , version 4.0 ) Persistence CAR.CD30 T cell vivo determine quantitative PCR flow cytometry peripheral blood sample Patient report symptom measure use select symptom NCI PRO-CTCAE . OUTLINE Cell Procurement Up 100 mL per collection ( 3 collection ) peripheral blood obtain patient cell procurement . In patient low ( CD3 count assay flow cytometry le 200/μl ) T-cell count peripheral blood , leukopheresis may perform isolate sufficient T cell . The parameter pheresis 2 blood volume . ATLCAR.CD30 Cells Administration ATLCAR.CD30 cell administer described 1-4 day ( preferably 1-2 day ) lymphodepletion bendamustine . ATLCAR.CD30 cell give licensed provider ( oncology nurse physician ) via intravenous injection 1-10 minute either peripheral central line . The expected volume 1-50cc . Patients partial response stable disease 6 week may receive second infusion ATLCAR.CD30 cell available . Note : Lymphodepletion bendamustine occur two consecutive day give prior second infusion cell ( applicable ) . Duration Therapy Therapy LCCC 1532 involve 1-2 infusion ATLCAR.CD30 cell . Treatment one infusion administer unless : - Patient decide withdraw study treatment , OR - General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator . Duration Follow-up Patients follow 15 year Replication Competent Retrovirus ( RCR ) evaluation death , whichever occur first . Patients remove study unacceptable adverse event follow resolution stabilization adverse event .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Informed consent explain , understood sign patient ; patient give copy inform consent . Greater equal 18 year age Diagnosis recurrent HL NHL patient fail least 1 salvage regimen i.e . currently receive would receive 3rd line therapy . Patients relapse autologous allogeneic stem cell transplant eligible study . CD30+ disease ( result pending time cell procurement , must confirm prior treatment ATLCAR.CD30 cell ) ; NOTE : CD30+ disease require document CD30 expression immunohistochemistry base institutional hematopathology standard Evidence adequate organ function define : The following require prior procurement : Hgb ≥ 8.0g/dL ( transfusion independent 2 week prior enrollment ) Bilirubin ≤1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 3 time ULN Serum creatinine ≤1.5 time ULN The following require prior infusion ATLCAR.CD30 cell : Bilirubin ≤1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ≤ 3 time ULN Serum creatinine ≤1.5 time ULN Pulse oximetry &gt; 90 % room air Imaging result within 30 day prior enrollment study ( use baseline measure documentation progression ) lymphodepletion .

Current use systemic corticosteroid dos ≥10mg/day prednisone equivalent ; receive &lt; 10mg/day may enrol discretion investigator Active infection HIV , HTLV , HBV , HCV ( pending time cell procurement ; sample confirm lack active infection use generate transduce cell ) define well control therapy . Patients require negative HIV antibody negative HIV viral load , negative HTLV1 2 antibody , negative Hepatitis B surface antigen , negative HCV antibody viral load . Patients strong inhibitor CYP1A2 ( e.g. , fluvoxamine , ciprofloxacin ) may increase plasma concentration bendamustine , decrease plasma concentration metabolite .
