	<brief_summary>Thermotherapy technology aim destroy tissue , example tumor tissue . Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy ( imILT ) specific form thermotherapy , , addition destroy tumor tissue , optimize cause tumor specific immunologic response . In laboratory animal imILT method also show induce call abscopal effect . This mean one tumor treat imILT , untreated , tumor also decrease size . The immunologic response previously characterize breast cancer patient receive imILT treatment , presume abscopal effect induce imILT also describe malignant melanoma patient . The purpose trial evaluate efficiency come local tumor destruction imILT treatment method patient diagnose solid tumor . The purpose also investigate functionality safety well understanding subsequent immunological effect . Since immunologically base treatment various solid tumor intense review call `` immune checkpoint inhibitor '' trial also provide valuable information imILT , future , could combine new , patient , effective treatment regimen . The treatment method successfully use treatment patient breast cancer malignant melanoma . Treatment breast cancer patient cause increase cytotoxic T lymphocytes treated tumor , well activate dendritic cell tumor border . Regulatory T lymphocytes decreased regional lymph node . This trial explorative , prospective , open non-randomized . Thirty patient diagnose solid tumor treat trial , estimate carried time period 18 month .</brief_summary>
