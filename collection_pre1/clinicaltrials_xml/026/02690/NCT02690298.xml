	<brief_summary>Previous study show ExSpiron™ provide non-invasive , real-time , accurate measurement minute ventilation ( MV ) , tidal volume ( TV ) respiratory rate ( RR ) calibration spirometer . The purpose study compare MV , TV RR value measure ExSpiron™ without prior spirometer calibration value obtain spirometer calibration . In study , MV TV value compare ExSpiron™ without prior patient-specific calibration ExSpiron™ spirometer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation ExSpiron™ Measurements Derived Without Patient Specific Calibration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order evaluate performance device range condition encounter clinical environment , respiratory volume monitor ( RVM ) test throughout range respiratory rate also erratic breathing pattern . At 4 36 breath per minute ( extremes rate anticipate encountered clinical setting ) , erratic breathing , RVM spirometry measurement find highly-correlated ( r=0.98 ±0.01 ( mean ±95 % CI ) 4 breaths/min , 0.97 ±0.01 36 , 0.93 ±0.04 erratic breathing ) . These study also include calibration ExSpiron spirometer . The primary objective study compare minute ventilation ( MV ) , tidal volume ( TV ) respiratory rate ( RR ) measurement collect report ExSpiron , without prior ExSpiron calibration , acquire MV , TV , RR measurements ExSpiron prior individual specific calibration spirometer use either Wright Spirometer Morgan Flow Volume Loop ( FVL ) Pneumotachograph Spirometer . A secondary objective confirm PadSet functionality 24 hour wear accordance current labeling .</detailed_description>
