	<criteria>1 . Corresponding CEmark indications/contraindications accord current medical guideline minimally invasive peripheral intervention . 2 . Patient present stenotic occlusive lesion iliac artery suitable stenting ( indication primary stenting , base discretion investigator ) 3 . Patient present score 2 5 follow Rutherford classification 4 . Patient willing comply specify followup evaluation specify time duration study 5 . Patient &gt; 18 year old 6 . Patient ( legal representative ) understand nature procedure provide write informed consent , prior enrolment study 7 . Patient eligible treatment BeGraft Peripheral Stent Graft System ( Bentley InnoMed ) 8 . The target lesion either modify TASCII class A , B , C D lesion one list specification : Type A lesion Unilateral bilateral stenosis Common Iliac Artery Unilateral bilateral single short ( ≤3 cm ) stenosis External Iliac Artery Type B lesion Unilateral Common Iliac Artery occlusion Single multiple stenosis total 310 cm involve External Iliac Artery extend Common Femoral Artery Unilateral External Iliac Artery occlusion involve origin Internal Iliac Artery Common Iliac Artery Type C lesions Bilateral Common Iliac Artery occlusions Bilateral External Iliac Artery stenoses 310 cm long extend Common Femoral Artery 9 . The target lesion angiographic evidence stenosis restenosis &gt; 50 % occlusion pass standard guidewire manipulation 10 . There angiographic evidence patent Common Deep Femoral Artery 1 . PTA technically possible ( feasible access lesion defect guidewire balloon catheter ) 2 . Presence aneurysm immediately adjacent site stent implantation 3 . Stenosis distal site stent implantation 4 . Lesions adjacent essential collateral ( ) 5 . Lesions location subject external compression 6 . Heavily calcified lesion resistant PTA 7 . Patients diffuse distal disease result poor stent outflow 8 . Patients history coagulation disorder 9 . Patients aspirin allergy bleeding complication patient unable unwilling tolerate anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy and/or nonresponders anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy 10 . Fresh thrombus formation 11 . Patients know hypersensitivity stent material ( L605 ) 12 . The target lesion either modify TASCII class B D lesion aortic common femoral lesion involvement : Type B lesion Short ( ≤3 cm ) stenosis infrarenal aorta Type C lesions Unilateral External Iliac Artery stenosis extend Common Femoral Artery Unilateral External Iliac Artery occlusion involve origins Internal Iliac and/or Common Femoral Artery Heavily calcify unilateral External Iliac Artery occlusion without involvement origin Internal Iliac and/or Common Femoral Artery Type D lesion Infrarenal aortoiliac occlusion Iliac stenoses patient Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ( AAA ) require treatment amenable endograft placement lesion require open aortic iliac surgery Diffuse multiple stenosis involve unilateral Common Iliac , External Iliac Common Femoral Artery Unilateral occlusion Common Iliac External Iliac Artery Diffuse disease involve aorta iliac artery require treatment Bilateral occlusion External Iliac Artery 13 . Previously implant stent ( ) lesion site 14 . Reference segment diameter suitable available stent design 15 . Untreatable lesion locate distal outflow artery 16 . Use alternative therapy ( e.g . atherectomy , cut balloon , laser , radiation therapy ) part index procedure 17 . Patients refuse treatment 18 . Patients antiplatelet therapy , anticoagulant thrombolytic drug contraindicate 19 . Patients exhibit persistent acute intraluminal thrombus propose lesion site 20 . Perforation angioplasty site evidence extravasation contrast medium 21 . Patients history prior lifethreatening contrast medium reaction 22 . Patients uncorrected bleed disorder 23 . Female patient child bear potential take adequate contraceptive currently breastfeed 24 . Life expectancy less twelve month 25 . Any planned surgical intervention/procedure within 30 day study procedure 26 . Any patient consider hemodynamically unstable onset procedure 27 .
