Written inform consent obtain subject/Legally Acceptable representative ( ) [ LAR ( ) ] subject prior perform study specific procedure . If subject capable give consent , his/her assent participate obtain extent possible . Subject previously participate ZOSTER006 ZOSTER022 study receive least one dose placebo . Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Nonchildbearing potential define premenarche , current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause . Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period* 2 month completion vaccination series . treatment period refers vaccination day interval . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) study vaccine period start 30 day first dose study vaccine ( Day 29 Day 0 ) , plan use 30 day post Dose 2 . Previous vaccination Varicella Zoster virus ( VZV ) HZ . Planned administration VZV HZ vaccination study ( include investigational nonregistered vaccine ) , exception study vaccine . Planned administration/administration vaccine/product foreseen study protocol period start 30 day first dose end 30 day last dose vaccine administration , exception license nonreplicating vaccine ( i.e . inactivate subunit vaccine , include inactivated subunit influenza vaccine , without adjuvant seasonal pandemic flu ) . These may administer 8 day prior dose 1 and/or dose 2 and/or least 14 day dose study vaccine Chronic administration ( defined 14 day total ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug period start six month prior first vaccine dose 30 day post Dose 2 . For corticosteroid , mean prednisone â‰¥ 20 mg/day equivalent . Inhaled , topical intraarticular corticosteroid allow . Administration longacting immunemodifying drug ( e.g . infliximab , rituximab ) within six month prior first vaccine dose 30 day post Dose 2 . Concurrently participate another clinical study , time enrolment plan participation 30 day post second dose , subject expose investigational noninvestigational vaccine/product ( pharmaceutical product device ) . Any confirm suspect immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition result disease ( e.g. , malignancy , Human Immunodeficiency Virus [ HIV ] infection ) immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy ( e.g. , medication use cancer chemotherapy , organ transplantation treat autoimmune disorder ) . History reaction hypersensitivity likely exacerbate component vaccine . Active HZ infection time enrolment ( i.e . HZ lesion completely crust ) . Pregnant lactate female . Any condition , opinion investigator , prevents subject participate study . Any condition judgment investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe .</criteria>
