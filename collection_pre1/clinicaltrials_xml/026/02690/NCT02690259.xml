	<brief_summary>In endometrial cancer ( EC ) pelvic paraaortic lymphadenectomy perform high risk group ( approximately 20 % patient lymph node metastasis ( LNM ) ) whereas lymphadenectomy recommend low risk group despite 5 % LNM . Moreover , preoperative risk group allocation know erroneous 15 % patient . A technique identify sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) endometrial cancer potential spare extensive surgery 80 % high risk patient , identify low risk patient nodal metastasis , diminish side effect cause full lymphadenectomy render expensive preoperative risk group allocation measure unnecessary . A clinically useful SLN technique require high technical success rate , clear definition SLN , algorithm take account metastatic node always accumulate tracer reproducible surgical algorithm . A definition SLN require knowledge lymphatic anatomy . Unfortunately tracer , dyes/radiotracers often result abundance colored/ signal node . Therefore , definition SLN require identification efferent/afferent lymph vessel . Several publication describe sentinel node technique EC variety tracer ( various dye , radiotracer , alone combination ) . Sentinel nod usually describe `` radioactive node '' `` color node '' discrimination . No study relate anatomical description lymphatic pathway . The aim study systematically display major anatomical pathway use ICG evaluate standardize reproducible SLN surgical algorithm base lymphatic anatomy identification efferent lymph vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endometrial cancer increasingly common gynecologic malignancy . The cumulative 5-year survival rate node negative patient 94 % , 75 % metastatic pelvic lymph node 38 % patient pelvic paraaortic metastasis . The proportion node positive patient adequately stag patient material ( usually high risk group ) report range 15-21 % . Depending use risk criterion lymph node metastasis occur 1.5-7.8 % low risk patient . Some study show well overall survival pelvic paraaortic lymphadenectomy , whereas study show increased complication survival benefit lymphadenectomy . Recent article recommend paraaortic pelvic lymp node metastasis ( LND ) high risk EC therapeutic value relate potential complication nodal stag EC debate well define risk group . An incidence 0.9-5.2 % severe lymphedema 3.1 % chylous ascites require treatment describe robotic pelvic paraaortic lymphadenectomy . The Sentinel node concept study extensively cancer form , example breast vulvar cancer . With mentioned controversy , patient EC would benefit tremendously function Sentinel node concept . Studies use patent blue radioactive tracer show satisfactory result . The Da Vinci system ( da VinciÂ® Surgical System , Intuitive Surgical Inc. , Sunnyvale , Ca , USA ) Firefly technique could make new concept possible major lymphatic drainage display learn , hence allow standardization SLN definition . In pilot study , reproducible surgical algorithm define , overcome compensate fact ICG spread quickly several node . Purpose : To develop reliable Sentinel node Concept use Firefly system ICG EC patient base defined lymphatic anatomy , clear definition sentinel node reproducible surgical algorithm . Hypothesis : The Firefly system use ICG enables use Sentinel node concept EC patient regardless risk group , patient pathologically proven lymph node metastasis undergo pelvic paraaortic lymphadenectomy . Methods Research : 375 consecutive EC patient plan robotic hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy high risk patient also pelvic paraaortic lymphadenectomy Skane University Hospital , Lund , Sweden enrol study prospectively give write consent . The study approve regional Institutional Review Board . With extended funding , study expand another University Hospital Sweden . Data operative outcome , operative postoperative complication , pathology report follow 24 month prospectively collect . The use Indocyanine green ( ICG ) Firefly system advantage fast uptake lymphatic vessel lymph node . Pilot study result new surgical method , standardization operative technique clear definition Sentinel lymph node enable study .</detailed_description>
