If emerge Part 1 data suggest particular tumour type specific tumour histology might responsive treatment , patient tumour type histology also include Part 2 study . Male female patient , 18 year age old . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior initiation treatment . Males females childbearing potential permit study long consent avoid get partner pregnant become pregnant , respectively , use highly effective contraception method , describe , throughout study 90 day completion . Highly effective method contraception include : hormonal method associate inhibition ovulation , intrauterine device ; surgical sterilization ( include partner 's vasectomy ) sexual abstinence , preferred usual lifestyle subject . Women nonchildbearing potential may include either surgically sterile postmenopausal ≥ 1 year Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 1 . Life expectancy great 3 month . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent form . Measurable evaluable disease define RECIST Version 1.1 Part 1 study ( patient include Part 2 require measurable disease ) . The measurable lesion HCC patient one previously treat locoregional therapy ( e.g . TACE , RFA ) unless lesion progress evidence new , measurable , enhancement dynamic imaging . Patient 1 follow available pharmacodynamic analysis : Archived diagnostic freshly obtain formalinfixed paraffin embed frozen tumour tissue Tumour tissue biopsy collect prior study drug administration Patient adequate bone marrow , renal , hepatic function follow : Haemoglobin : ≥ 90 g/L Absolute Neutrophil Count : ≥ 1.5 × 109/L Platelets : ≥ 100 × 109/L ( Part 1 ) ; ≥ 75 × 109/L ( Part 2 ) Total Bilirubin : ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) : ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN Prothrombin Time ( PT ) /International Normalised Ratio ( INR ) : ≤ 1.5 ( patient anticoagulant PT INR determine Investigator ) Serum creatinine : ≤ 1.5 × ULN Creatinine Clearance ( calculate serum creatinine use CockcroftGault formula ) ≥ 60 mL/min patient creatinine level institutional normal Patient receive anticancer therapy include chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , hormonal , biologic , investigational therapy locoregional therapy within period 21 day prior Study Day 1 ( 6 week nitrosureas mitomycin C ) . Prior concurrent use hormone replacement therapy , use gonadotropinreleasing hormone modulators prostate cancer , use somatostatin analogue neuroendocrine tumours permit . Patient unresolved clinically significant toxicity prior anticancer therapy , define National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) Version 4.03 ; Grade 2 high , apart alopecia . Patients heart failure ( New York Heart Association &gt; Class II ) within 6 month prior study entry ; symptomatic coronary artery disease ; clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia define ≥ Grade 3 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) , Version 4.03 ; uncontrolled hypertension , myocardial infarction occur within 6 month prior study entry . Patient active clinically serious infection define ≥ Grade 3 NCI CTCAE , Version 4.03 . Patients clinically significant pericardial effusion , pleural effusion ascites .
