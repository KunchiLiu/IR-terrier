	<brief_title>Predicting Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response Using Combined MRI Scinti-Mammography ( MRI-SMM ) System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal goal neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) breast cancer achieve pathologic complete response ( pCR ) least toxicity . As effective therapy become available , one challenge evaluate response tumor timely manner , optimal regimen give patient . Reliable image method monitor predict NAC response need . MRI known accurate image modality evaluate response NAC base tumor shrinkage , far reliable parameter measure early time administration drug predict final treatment outcome . Furthermore , patient may contradiction receive MRI , tolerate long scan time prone position . Other image modality measure early functional ( particularly metabolic ) change investigate , show success . In study investigator assess role MR-compatible scinti-mammography ( MRI-SMM ) system monitor predict NAC response . A total 75 breast cancer patient receive NAC enrol , subject receive 3 image study , , complete NAC . The aim : 1 ) compare tumor size measure SMM MRI different time ; 2 ) evaluate respective diagnostic accuracy post-NAC residual disease measure SMM MRI compare pathological examination result gold standard ; 3 ) investigate respective combine ability MRI SMM , base pre-treatment early change first follow-up imaging , predict pathologic complete response ( pCR ) . The diagnostic result obtain use MRI SMM tumor vary stage different time NAC provide important information establish role standalone SMM system , well combine MRI-SMM system , management breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
