	<brief_summary>The `` Gut Hormone Addiction '' study proof-of-concept experimental medicine human study answer follow question : 1 . Does administration hormone desacyl ghrelin reduce core behavioural component addiction dependent individual recently stop smoke tobacco drinking alcohol , overweight/obese subject ? 2 . Does administration drug Exenatide reduce core behavioural component addiction dependent individual recently stop smoke tobacco drinking alcohol , overweight/obese subject ? 3 . Does administration desacyl ghrelin Exenatide reduce reward response high-calorie food appetite dependent individual recently stop smoke tobacco drinking alcohol , overweight/obese subject ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gut Hormones Obesity , Nicotine Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity , smoke alcohol dependence major health burden society . Relapse alcohol smoke abstinence common despite use combine behavioural support current limit available medication . In obesity , nonsurgical intervention also disappoint achieve longterm weight loss . Therefore , press need develop novel drug treatment addiction derive knowledge brain mechanism related relapse reward responses food drug . There evidence animal gut hormone , produce stomach intestine , influence consumption food desire food , also alcohol , nicotine drug abuse . Examples gut hormone glucagon-like peptide1 ( GLP1 ) ghrelin . The influence hormone exert brain system involve core behavioural component addiction : reward sensitivity , stress , impulsivity compulsivity . These component often also see obesity food-related disorder binge eat disorder . It unknown whether gut hormone directly influence core behavioural component addiction human , particularly abstinence . The investigator examine acute effect Exenatide ( mimic GLP1 ) desacyl ghrelin ( counteracts active acyl ghrelin ) , infused vein , brain reward system , crave food , cigarettes alcohol , addictive eating behaviour . The investigator recruit adult nicotine alcohol dependence recently stop smoke drinking , overweight/obese adult . The investigator use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan computer-based test 3 separate study day study different aspect eat addictive behaviour .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female volunteer age 18 60 year . 2 . Healthy determine responsible physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test , cardiac monitoring psychiatric evaluation . Any volunteer clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include , investigator concur find unlikely jeopardize either volunteer safety study integrity . 3 . The subject capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . 4 . The subject able read , comprehend record information write English . 5 . For nondependent group : ) Overweight/obese volunteer BMI 28.050.0 kg/m2 . 6 . For addiction group : Subjects meet DSMV criterion previous nicotine alcohol dependence , early stable abstinence ( 6 weeks12 month ) . Minor lapse within time period allow relapse dependence . ii ) Abstinent alcohol dependent individual score least moderately alcohol dependent measure retrospectively use Severity Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire ( SADQ ) , abstinent 6 week 12 month . iii ) Abstinent tobacco dependent individual score least moderately tobacco dependence measure retrospectively use Fagerstr√∂m Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) , stable tobacco abstinence 6 weeks12 month . Potential volunteer NOT eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : 1 . Previous history recreational use abuse substance addiction permissible , use illegal drug ( except cannabis ) month prior Screening Visit course study , except specify individual group . 2 . For individual group : ) Overweight/obese group : history current alcohol abuse dependence , current consumption outside recommend guideline &gt; 21 units/week male &gt; 14 female , score = &gt; 8 ( indicator hazardous harmful alcohol use ) measure use Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test ( AUDIT ) ; nicotine use `` never smoke '' , i.e . &gt; 100 cigarette lifetime use ; history dependence , abuse heavy recreational use cocaine , cannabis , opiates substance abuse ; history problem gambling . Any previous current psychiatric diagnosis list DSMV Axis I , opinion clinical team compromise conduct interpretability study . ii ) Abstinent tobacco dependent group : history current alcohol abuse dependence , current consumption outside recommend guideline &gt; 21 units/week male &gt; 14 female , score = &gt; 8 ( indicator hazardous harmful alcohol use ) measure use AUDIT ; history dependence cocaine , cannabis , opiates substance abuse ; history problem gambling ; take varenicline , bupropion prescription medication smoke cessation . Any previous current psychiatric diagnosis list DSMV Axis I , opinion clinical team compromise conduct interpretability study . iii ) Abstinent alcohol dependent group : history dependence cocaine , cannabis , opiates substance abuse ; history problem gambling ; take prescription medication alcohol smoke cessation withdrawal ; smoking allow past present include dependence ; current nicotine replacement therapy allow . 3 . Currently suffer DSMV depressive disorder antidepressant medication , though history depression anxiety allow . A current past history endure severe mental illness ( e.g. , schizophrenia , bipolar affective disorder ) allow . For group : 4 . Cannabis use five time month prior Screening Visit allow , use within one week experimental assessment ; use illegal drug month prior Screening Visit course study . 5 .

History presence neurological diagnosis ( limited include , example , stroke , epilepsy , space occupy lesion , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , vascular dementia , transient ischemic attack , may influence outcome analysis scan result ) . A history alcoholrelated alcoholwithdrawal seizure allow volunteer abstinent alcoholic group . 13 . Significant current past medical psychiatric history , opinion investigator , contraindicate participation . 14 . Clinically significant head injury ( e.g . require hospitalisation surgical intervention ) opinion investigator may affect subject safety outcome measure . 15 .
