	<brief_summary>Hypomagnesemia ( hMg ) common side effect important anti-cancer therapy epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor ( EGFRIs ) platinum-containing anti-cancer drug . EGFRIs , include cetuximab ( cmab ) panitumumab ( pmab ) , estimate cause hMg 18 % 27 % patient respectively1 , 90 % patient receive cisplatin develop hMg left untreated . The development severe hMg may result increase symptom fatigue , neuromuscular change , mental status change cardiac arrhythmia could result treatment delay may compromise treatment efficacy . Despite common occurrence toxicity , little known regard optimal magnesium management strategy . As physician know `` best '' treatment patient , genuine uncertainty ( `` clinical equipoise '' ) exist . Physicians choose different `` standard '' magnesium replacement personal practice , use idiosyncratic decision making process , without physician patient know optimal option . This good patient , physician society whole . Determining optimal treatment remain important medical issue patient , physician society . This study use novel method allow comparison establish standard care prophylactic treatment use `` integrated consent model '' part pragmatic clinical trial7 . By integrate medical clinical practice , physician able inform patient randomize control trial , akin typical conversation physician patient , without write informed consent . This clinical interaction would document , ordinarily do practice . Medical clinical practice intertwine patient ' welfare forefront best interest .</brief_summary>
