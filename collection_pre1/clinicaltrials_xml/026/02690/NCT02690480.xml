	<brief_summary>This international , multicentre , double-blind , control , randomize phase II study compare efficacy safety fulvestrant combination palbociclib versus fulvestrant plus placebo postmenopausal woman HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer receive ≥5 year endocrine therapy adjuvant set treatment early disease remain disease free &gt; 12 month follow completion `` de novo '' metastatic disease . Patients must least one lesion ( measurable and/or non-measurable ) accurately assessed baseline suitable repeat assessment CT , MRI plan x-ray . Patients bone-only disease must lytic mixed ( lytic + blastic ) lesion , previously irradiate accurately assessed CT/MRI x-ray . Approximately 190 patient randomize 1:1 experimental arm ( approximately 95 patient treat fulvestrant plus palbociclib ) control arm ( approximately 95 patient treat fulvestrant plus placebo ) . Primary Objective : • To compare efficacy fulvestrant combination palbociclib versus fulvestrant plus placebo term rate Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) 1 year postmenopausal woman HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously treat endocrine therapy least 5 year remain disease free 12 month follow completion `` de novo '' metastatic disease</brief_summary>
