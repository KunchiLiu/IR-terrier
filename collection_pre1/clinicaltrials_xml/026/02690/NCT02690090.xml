	<brief_summary>The investigator study first step ( pilot study ) determine whether manufacturer 's recommend dose blood thinner call enoxaparin , adults patient intensive care unit severely reduce kidney function ( less equal approximately 30 % normal function ) safe respect adverse effect bleeding . The investigator hypothesis study patient , go forward time , without interfere care , eventually determine blood thinner safe reduced dos , feasible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Enoxaparin Prophylaxis Critically Ill Adults With Severe Renal Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : To determine feasibility conduct single centre , open-label , prospective study inform preparation prospective phase III study evaluate efficacy &amp; safety enoxaparin prophylaxis critically ill adult creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min . Study Design : A pilot open-label , single-arm , prospective study . Patients : Critically ill adult ( &gt; 18 year ) creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min . Setting : The Ottawa Hospital Intensive Care Units Sample Size : n=30 . Intervention : Study patient receive enoxaparin 30 mg S.C. daily VTE prophylaxis direct responsible Intensivist . The investigator direct clinical intervention manner . Primary/Feasibility Outcomes : screening enrolment rate goal recruit least 5 patient collectively , ICUs , per month . Secondary/Clinical Outcomes : Determining accumulation anti-Xa concentration , , record rate major bleeding , VTE , HIT study . Trial Duration : Anticipated 24 month . Analysis : Statistical analysis perform use SAS software Ottawa Hospital Methods Centre . Patient demographic clinical baseline characteristic describe . Continuous variable present mean ( SD ) , ordinal variable median ( IQR ) categorical variable proportion . Cox proportional hazard analysis use evaluate association trough anti-Xa level major bleeding .</detailed_description>
