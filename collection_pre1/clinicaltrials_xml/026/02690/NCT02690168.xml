	<detailed_description>Following detection severe hypoglycemia central nervous system ( CNS ) , series physiological countermeasure trigger return serum glucose euglycemic level . This vital homeostatic response frequently become dysfunctional type 1 type 2 diabetic , leave particularly vulnerable life threaten bout hypoglycemia . This dysfunction , often term hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure ( HAAF ) , think cause maladaptive change CNS . Currently , progress towards rectify HAAF severely hinder lack knowledge regard exact nature maladaptive change antecedent event cause . Previous work PI , well others , identify altered glial metabolism potential biological substrate driving HAAF . The alteration glial metabolism associate HAAF strikingly similar induce prolonged dietary restriction rodent . This raise intriguing possibility HAAF may drive glial adaptation , normally induce prolonged starvation , trigger diabetic individual treatment-induced exposure severe hypoglycemia . The primary goal pilot project conduct prospective observational study human test hypothesis prolong fast induce change glial metabolism similar previously measure individual HAAF . The investigator accomplish goal via follow specific aim : Aim 1 : Using prospective observational study design human , test whether 72 hour fast induce acute alteration glial metabolism , Aim 2 : Determine change plasma glucose leptin level follow prolonged fasting correlate change glial adaptation . The investigator utilize innovative 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy measure alterations glial metabolism substrate preference follow acute dietary restriction healthy young individual . By demonstrate metabolic adaptation glial cell induce prolonged fasting similar previously associate HAAF , investigator provide key insight precursor may lead development HAAF diabetic individual .</detailed_description>
