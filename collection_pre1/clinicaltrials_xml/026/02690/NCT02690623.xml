	<brief_title>Benefits Cost-Effectiveness Pediatric Hospitalist Service : Stepped Wedge Quality Improvement Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Inpatient hospital service constitute large share ( 29 % ) total national health care spending . Hospitalizations child cost $ 37 billion annually . The traditional model , inpatient care provide primary care pediatrician replace new model pediatric hospitalists whose primary exclusive professional focus care hospitalize patient . This shift driven increase illness severity complexity hospitalize child , challenge manage child office-based pediatrician , increase demand high quality , efficient cost-effective hospital care . Although pediatric hospitalist model system widely disseminate , value improve clinical outcome control health care cost remain demonstrated . The findings study pediatric adult hospitalists mix , almost study low quality , mostly retrospective comparison subject variety bias . With necessity restrain health care spending , funding require Medicaid 3rd-party payer develop sustain high-quality pediatric hospitalists service may forthcoming unless show improve outcome acceptable reduced cost . The investigator propose conduct evaluation cost-effectiveness pediatric hospitalist care assess describe stepped wedge QI trial . The pediatric hospitalist program initiate Department Pediatrics Medical School support plan stepwise implementation Children 's Memorial Hermann Hospital ( CMHH ) start 2016 . Patient Methods Aims . To assess rigorous feasible manner whether pediatric hospitalist service soon implement CMHH cost-effective -- expressed net cost saving per hospital day prevent ( health system perspective ) â€”as well beneficial improve clinical outcome parent , nurse , physician satisfaction relative general pediatrics service . Trial Hypothesis : The hospitalist program cost-effective either reduce hospital day without increase health system cost , reduce health system cost without increase hospital day , reduce . Design : Stepped Wedge Quality Improvement Trial . Rationale . It would desirable feasible use conventional parallel group randomize trial least two reason : 1 ) With new hire , number hospitalists increase substantially study period , fix allocation patient ( e.g. , usual 1:1 ratio ) hospitalist general pediatrics service throughout study would efficiently use faculty ; 2 ) Random assignment patient would difficult implement , might result unacceptable imbalance number patient assign 4 different hospitalist general pediatric team , would intrude current routine likely resist hospital administration . Stepped-wedge trial involve sequential roll-out intervention groups- care , 4 hospital service , number time period . At end entire study group receive intervention . Each serf control before/after comparison also control group comparison group across time . Thus , design allows group within-group analysis . Moreover , also allow flexibility decide initiate stepwise increase patient serve augment intervention strategy base upon problem solution identify time . This design particularly appropriate implement intervention like hospitalist program likely clinical benefit minimal risk , feasible logistical financial reason either randomize deliver intervention simultaneously participant . To end , investigator use stepped-wedge QI trial design serially introduce hospitalist program 4 inpatient service CMHH currently staff primary care pediatricians General Pediatric Division . The researcher choose use design allow partial adjustment important temporal change may occur unrelated intervention , facilitate rigorous assessment treatment effect usual pre- post-intervention comparison , also allow investigator start project quickly available faculty focus optimize hospitalist care service successively . Patients . Children 18 year younger admit 4 pediatric inpatient service ( include observation status ) CMHH . These service include inpatient ward intermediate care bed . ( Patients first admit pediatric intensive care unit [ ICU ] consider enrol study transfer pediatric service . ) To adjust important chance difference service baseline patient risk , study personnel blind service categorize child high risk high risk base finding present admission general pediatrics hospitalist service . This designation base predefined criterion easily apply admission relate risk prolong expensive hospitalization ( e.g . transfer pediatric ICU , admission IMU , mechanical ventilation , do-not-resuscitate order , schedule surgery ) . Treatment Allocation . Currently , 4 pediatric inpatient service admit patient every day ; 2 admitting service accept every patient without regard diagnosis . These procedure alter study avoid disrupt current hospital routine still allow quasi-randomized assignment different service unaffected child 's prior history his/her diagnose condition admission . The order hospitalist service implement randomly determine . General Pediatric Services CMHH . The attend pediatrician service conduct daily morning round weekday , supervise student house staff available resident phone person day . On weeknight , on-call pediatrician available resident phone . On weekend two on-call pediatrician make round , supervise resident , take call home 4 service . This approach General Pediatric Services change materially hospitalists assume responsibility one 4 service . Hospitalist Services CMHH . The hospitalist service MHH phase accord number hospitalists appoint new Pediatric Hospitalist Division . As currently plan hospitalist service involve in-house hospitalist hour . The attend hospitalist hospitalist service make morning round weekdays present supervise resident provide care throughout day . A different hospitalist cover night . On weekend , one hospitalist cover 2 service day . Outcomes : Primary : cost-effectiveness , express net cost saving per hospital day prevent assess health system perspective . Secondary : Hospital day ( include 30-day readmission ) , severe deterioration ( transfer pediatric ICU , intubation , unexpected surgery , death ) day diversion patient ED , pediatric ICU , IMU ) , parent satisfaction discharge , nurse resident satisfaction assess year , cost express healthcare system perspective . Sample Size . The sample size wo n't ca n't predefined . The important problem predefined sample size use avoid - bias decide stop enrollment -is unlikely problem decision stop enrollment base factor ( case , recruitment hospitalists ) unlikely hinge accrue result . Another problem fix sample size intend avoid imprecision effect size identify . For study , precision estimate limit number child admit 4 service 2-3 year study period . This likely large feasible sample size study , &gt; 8,000 admits expect 3 yr . Statistical Analyses . All analysis conduct individual patient level use generalize linear mixed model ( GLMM ) . Separate GLMMs use outcome . GLMMs account step wedge design , individual level covariates , service level covariates , allow service different number patient time point . For secondary outcome , investigator investigate best fitting distributional form ( i.e. , Normal , gamma ) estimate relative risk ( RRs ) intervention effect . Each model include treatment group ( intervention/control ) , time ( 5 plan period ) , season , age , ethnicity , insurance status , baseline patient risk , time hospital admission ( day weekdays : 8 - 5 pm ; weekday night ; weekend ) covariates , random effect child ( account within subject correlation due possible repeat admission child ) . Estimates RRs 95 % credible interval report posterior probability benefit cost-effectiveness . Prior distribution covariates neutral exclude implausible large treatment effect ~N ( 0 , SD=0.35 ) . Interim analysis perform 6 month hospitalists become responsible 2nd 3rd service verify hospitalist program unexpectedly worsen outcome increase cost expand program 4 service . Otherwise study continue plan final analysis perform patient admit 6 month hospitalists assume responsibility 4th final service . The investigator conclude hospitalist program cost effective Bayesian analysis indicate 90 % high probability reduces hospital day and/or reduces cost . Cost-Effectiveness Analyses . Hospital day compute number hospital day admission four service ( include day spend hospital pediatric ICU transfer one service ) subsequent readmission occur within 30 day discharge . These data obtain search claim data 13 Memorial Hermann Health System hospital . Hospitalizations outside system identify high-risk chronically ill child part separate ongoing QI study . If expect , parent satisfaction increase and/or arrangement care discharge great hospitalist care , rehospitalizations identify would expect less hospitalist care , factor would result conservative estimate reduction total hospital day care . The incremental cost hospitalist care relate prevented hospital day healthcare system perspective follow state-of-the-art guideline . Hospital cost admission one 4 service ( exclude prior cost incur emergency room [ ER ] pediatric intensive care unit [ ICU ] ) estimate use claims-based hospital charge multiply department-specific cost-to-charge ratio specify hospital 's annual Medicare Cost Report . The cost inflated 2018 U.S. dollar base Consumer Price Index medical service . Physician cost estimate use relative value unit ( RVU ) -based method . The resource-based RVU physician service provide hospital day obtain medical school billing system multiply Medicare conversion factor . Costs hospitalist care augment include salary differential and/or supplement receive hospitalists take night shift . Differences cost hospital day treatment group assess use generalize linear model log-link gamma distribution . The model include treatment group ( intervention/control ) , time ( 5 period ) , season , age , ethnicity , insurance status , baseline patient risk , time hospital admission ( day weekdays : 8 - 5 pm ; weekday night ; weekend ) covariates , account correlation within patient . The incremental cost ( saving ) hospitalist care compute subtract mean cost per patient group mean cost per patient general pediatrics group . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compute dividing incremental cost ( saving ) hospital day avoid . The investigator also assess robustness result sensitivity analyse assess joint influence hospitalists care cost effectiveness use net monetary benefit approach . Secondary Economic Analysis . Analyses medical school perspective evaluate effect hospitalist intervention relative usual care difference revenue cost ( i.e . net gain loss ) inpatient care , exclude research-related cost .</detailed_description>
