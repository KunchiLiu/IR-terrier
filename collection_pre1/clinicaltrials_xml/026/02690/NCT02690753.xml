	<brief_summary>The prevalence pressure ulcer hospital 7,3 % - 23 % . The primary etiological factor pressure pressure combine shear . Prevention important comprises : preventive skin care include cleanse protect skin exposure moisture , systematic repositioning patient , offload heel surface bed , use adequate bed support surface adequate nutritional status . The development implementation risk base prevention plan individual identify risk strongly recommend . Limited compliance exist towards pressure ulcer preventive intervention . 25,5 % patient risk receive fully adequate prevention bed . The reposition frequence adequate 55 % patient risk . There lack rigorously perform research address effectiveness device risk base protocol improve compliance . Health care budget limit , priority set allocation health care resource . The primary aim study compare effectiveness turn position system ( PrevalonÂ®Turn Position System 2.0 , SAGE ) versus standard care improve reposition frequence patient risk . The second aim compare effectiveness tailor protocol versus standard care improve reposition frequence patient risk . The third aim compare effectiveness standardize incontinence care versus standard care improve incidence pressure ulcer incontinence-associated dermatitis ( IAD ) . Also health economic evaluation perform . The study perform hospital setting ( university general hospital ) random sample 226 patient age &gt; 18 risk develop pressure ulcer . Patients recruit three type ward : intensive care unit , geriatric ward rehabilitation ward . Patients include study period 8 day .</brief_summary>
