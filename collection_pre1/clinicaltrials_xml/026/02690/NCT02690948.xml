	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pembrolizumab without vismodegib work treat patient skin basal cell cancer spread place body remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Vismodegib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether pembrolizumab effective alone together vismodegib treat skin basal cell cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab With Without Vismodegib Treating Metastatic Unresectable Basal Cell Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall response rate ( ORR ) unresectable metastatic basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) patient pembrolizumab monotherapy disease progression smoothen inhibitor monotherapy . II . Determine overall response rate ( ORR ) unresectable metastatic BCC patient pembrolizumab plus vismodegib partial response stable disease smoothen inhibitor monotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine nature severity adverse event pembrolizumab BCCs . II . Determine nature severity adverse event pembrolizumab plus vismodegib BCCs . III . Determine whether level lymphocytic infiltration program cell death ligand ( PDL ) 1 increase treatment pembrolizumab , well additional search immunologic biomarkers response cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8 density patient unresectable metastatic BCC . IV . Determine whether level lymphocytic infiltration PDL1 increase treatment pembrolizumab plus vismodegib , well additional search immunologic biomarkers response CD8 patient unresectable metastatic BCC . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients experience disease progression previous treatment vismodegib receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses every 21 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients achieve partial response stable disease previous treatment vismodegib may continue receive vismodegib orally ( PO ) day 1-21 per standard care pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 30 day 90 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
