	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis many health consequence . A reduction ability perform exercise patient CF relate great death rate , steep decline lung function , frequent lung infection . However , physiological mechanism reduce exercise capacity unknown . The investigator recently publish first evidence systemic vascular dysfunction patient CF . Therefore , reasonable suspect blood vessel involve exercise intolerance CF . This study look oxidative stress contributes artery dysfunction exercise intolerance CF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) common fatal genetic disease North America . The disturb aspect CF associate premature death , often due respiratory complication . Clinical manifestation CF include lung dysfunction , many systemic consequence well . Systemic oxidative stress exercise intolerance establish phenotype patient CF . Additionally , first time investigator recently publish presence systemic endothelial dysfunction cohort young patient CF exhibit normal oxygen saturation spirometric function . Exercise intolerance , limitation ability perform exercise expect level , show predict mortality patient CF independent lung function . Exercise capacity ( VO2 peak ) , objective measurement exercise tolerance , drop approximately 5-8 % per year patient CF . This excessive decay exercise capacity lead pulmonary infection deterioration lung function , represent 5-8 fold decline compare healthy sedentary adult . Preventing excessive annual reduction exercise capacity essential increase quality life longevity patient CF . However , critical barrier improve exercise capacity CF investigator lack knowledge regard different physiological mechanism contribute exercise intolerance . It important emphasize decrease lung function ( FEV1 ) always contribute reduction VO2 peak . Furthermore , less 2 % patient FEV1 great 50 % predict significant drop hemoglobin oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) maximal exercise . These data suggest mechanism lung function induce hypoxemia may contribute exercise intolerance patient CF .</detailed_description>
