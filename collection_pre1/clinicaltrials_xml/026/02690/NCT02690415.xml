	<brief_summary>Infections due S. aureus major healthcare burden . Currently effective way prevent S. aureus infection . Treatment failure happen 20 % patient SSTI mean additional cost per patient $ 1500 . Antibiotics often prescribed treatment CA-S. aureus SSTI . Current IDSA CA-MRSA guideline suggest incision drainage alone may adequate management uncomplicated CA-S. aureus skin abscesses uncertainty need antibiotic . It know whether antibiotic helpful decrease S. aureus colonization rate prevent future S. aureus infection . Though resolution acute abscess drainage may unchanged antibiotic administration , impact manage S. aureus abscess without antibiotic ongoing S. aureus colonization recurrent infection require study . This study seek examine whether management initial S. aureus abscesses incision drainage addition antibiotic therapy effective mean prevent recurrent infection . The prolonged longitudinal follow-up study another unique characteristic enable investigator capture data recurrence infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) associate almost exclusively healthcare-associated infection . However , new epidemic strain emerge outside healthcare environment designate community-associated ( CA ) MRSA . From 1999 2005 , hospitalization Staphylococcus aureus-related skin soft tissue infection ( SSTI ) United States increase 4-fold nearly 90,000 annually . At Memorial Medical Center ( MMC ) Emergency Department ( ED ) Express Cares ( EC ) 6500 visit last 6 year secondary SSTI . Current Infectious Diseases Society America ( IDSA ) guideline suggest incision drainage alone ( without antibiotic ) may adequate management uncomplicated MRSA skin abscess . However , patient receive antibiotic likely develop recurrent infection , may result persistent MRSA colonization . The investigator conduct prospective case-control study MMC ED , EC MMC primary care clinic pediatric patient skin abscess compare outcomes receive antibiotic ( case ) versus ( control ) . This intervention study - surgical medical management patient skin abscess discretion treat physician . The central hypothesis inclusion systemic antibiotic management S. aureus skin abscess decrease S. aureus colonization , subsequently incidence recurrent SSTI year follow baseline infection . To gain good understanding problem , investigator propose follow specific aim :</detailed_description>
