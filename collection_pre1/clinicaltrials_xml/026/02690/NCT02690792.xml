	<brief_summary>One-third US population non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) due obesity ~8 million individual progressive form disease , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . Currently , noninvasive way determine individual NAFLD develop NASH . This medical importance since NASH prelude development end-stage liver disease . The study NAFLD limit several factor , include difficulty associate study liver metabolism vivo human . Our group pioneer new method use nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) measure intermediary hepatic metabolism human goal directly study pathophysiology bland steatosis NASH . In study , noninvasive method use characterize compare metabolic alteration accompany bland steatosis NASH test hypothesis detect hepatic mitochondrial metabolism contribute disorder . Such characterization fundamental establish rational approach prevention treatment NAFLD may provide simple , non-invasive method differentiate benign progressive form NAFLD . This proposal address via separate isotopic study occur different time point prolong fast . In subject NAFLD , study carry treatment Vitamin E placebo . Healthy subject participate initial baseline study without Vitamin E placebo intervention . The study design harness physiologic change occur short- long-term fasting provide rapid cost-effective method accomplish aim application .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Procedures ( Healthy NAFLD/NASH Subjects ) Screening ( Week -2 ) Prior initiation timeline , potential study participant evaluate research nurse obtain informed consent , brief medical history , height , weight , body mass index , waist/hip circumference , vital sign , approximately 20mls . blood screen labs urine analysis . NAFLD/NASH subject available liver serology additional 25 ml blood drawn . This visit take approximately 60 minute include screen questionnaire family history disease , activity daily live ( ADL ) , alcohol consumption . Diabetic subject also withhold oral diabetic agent prior fast screen labwork . Teaching Visit : ( Week -2 prior week -1 ) : A research nurse give diabetic subject 30-minute refresher course diabetes include sign symptom hyper hypoglycemia . A teaching booklet give diabetic subject . Some type 2 diabetic ( T2DM ) patient oral medication regularly check blood sugar . If patient glucometer , provide glucometer , supply instruction use diabetic study volunteer study participation . Prior initiation standardize diet , subject maintain normal dietary routine . For three four day prior protocol procedure , subject place standardized diet provide CTRC metabolic kitchen . In addition , participant refrain physical exercise least 3 day prior procedure . Also , T2DM participant withhold oral diabetic agent 3-4 day prior protocol procedure . Phenotyping ( Week -1 ) Participants ask write food beverage consumption three day prior visit . This food log turn dietician Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) calculation protein , carbohydrate fat order calculate tailor 3.5 day meal plan consume prior overnight Fast . Participants ask eat drink anything midnight prior visit preparation day 's study procedure . Diabetic participant withhold oral diabetic agent 3 day prior Phenotyping visit day visit . During time , instruct check blood glucose 30 minute prior meal bedtime daily notify research nurse study physician blood glucose level 70 mg/dl 250 mg/dl . Participants arrive Advanced Imaging Research Center ( AIRC ) approximately 8:30 AM . During morning , participant measurement liver fat 3 Tesla ( 3T ) Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) scanner measurement respiratory quotient ( RQ ) use indirect calorimeter . Immediately follow scan , two intravenous catheter place preparation insulin/clamp study : antecubital vein catheter infuse dextrose insulin dorsal hand vein catheter blood sampling . The hand keep hot box 70 °C arterialization venous blood . Three 10 ml . blood draw obtain baseline glucose level measurement , insulin infusate preparation , blood chemistry analysis . At approximately 11:30 A.M. , prim continuous infusion regular human insulin start duration 2 hour . A 20 % dextrose infusion start 4 minute insulin infusion adjust maintain euglycemia . A small amount blood ( 1 ml . ) drawn every 5 minute 2 hour monitor plasma glucose concentration . The total amount blood require whole procedure approximately 80 ml . A urine specimen collect determination urinary glucose loss post-absorptive state . Approximately 3 healthy volunteer additional measurement liver fat insulin clamp determine change evident test . The participant give meal discharge AIRC . The duration visit approximately 7 hour . Overnight Fast ( Week 0 ) Diabetic participant withhold oral diabetic agent 4 day prior Overnight Fast visit day visit . During time , instruct check blood glucose 30 minute prior breakfast bedtime daily notify research nurse study physician blood glucose level 70 mg/dl 250 mg/dl . Four day prior metabolic study , participant begin tailor diet provide CTRC metabolic kitchen . The day prior fast study , participant final meal noon begin fast . The following day arrive Advanced Imaging Research Center liver Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) . Deuterium oxide ( a.k.a . heavy water ) , first stable isotope , administer accord participant 's weight three divide dos . Participants receive carbon-13 label [ U-13C ] propionate ( three 400 mg dos give mouth 1 hour ) . During study , subject also give 0.5 % heavy water ad libitum . Subjects undergo measurement respiratory quotient ( RQ ) use indirect calorimeter prior infusion protocol . Subjects intravenous catheter place infusion stable isotope carbon-13 label [ 3,4-13C2 ] glucose , carbon-13 label [ 1,2-13C ] acetoacetate carbon-13 label [ 3,4-13C ] 3-hydroxybutyrate initiate two hour . During period , 5 ml . blood draw occur every hour determine plasma non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFA ) , ketone , glucose , insulin , glucagon level . At two hrs initiation infusion , 50 ml . blood draw perform obtain sample spectroscopic determination rate ketogenesis citrate oxidation citric acid ( TCA ) cycle . At completion study procedure , stable isotope infusion stop participant send CTRC outpatient clinic Dual Energy x-Ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) determine estimate total body fat measurement . After DEXA , healthy subject discharge home ; NAFLD subject admit CTRC liver biopsy , need . The conclusion metabolic study week 0 mark end study control subject , NAFLD subject initiate Vitamin E placebo therapy time point . All subject give meal evaluate stability ( vital sign within normal limit ) prior discharge home . The total amount blood collect overnight fast study less 325 ml . Follow-Up Visits ( Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 ) Subjects visit research nurse and/or Dr. Browning monitor compliance vitamin E/placebo regime . At follow-up visit , subject blood collect ( approximately 10mls . ) per Table 1 . Additionally , volunteer MRS measure liver triglyceride content . Phenotype Visit ( Week 16 ) This repeat phenotype visit Week -1 . Overnight Fast ( Week 17 ) This repeat overnight fast Week 0 . All procedure , include isotope study .</detailed_description>
