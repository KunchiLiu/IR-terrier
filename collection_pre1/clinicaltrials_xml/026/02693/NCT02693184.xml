	<detailed_description>The purpose study validate revise food frequency questionnaire design capture vitamin D , calcium protein intake population elderly men woman fragility fracture . Protein , calcium protein intake correlated biochemical measure bone mineral density measure DXA . Eligibility Criteria ) Forty-five eligible participant recruit endocrine referral osteoporosis/fracture . They men woman , age &gt; 65 year fragility fracture ( defined fracture sustain fall stand height less ) . They English speak . They need mental capacity recall event , ( MMSE score Â³24 ) .11 They need telephone ability answer question phone . They secondary cause fragility fracture malabsorption ( celiac disease , bariatric surgery ) , liver disease , organ transplant , hyperparathyroidism , multiple myeloma , current cancer diagnosis , alcoholism . They renal disease require dialysis ( dietary requirement patient quite different general elderly population ) . They tubefeeds kind ( although supplemental food Ensure allow ) . Interventions Evaluations ) The evaluation include history physical exam , mini mental status exam . Two telephone interview conduct ~ 4 week apart Block 2014 questionnaire give revise screener give . The order questionnaire give randomized . As part standard care workup osteoporosis , biochemical workup include 25-hydroxyvitamin D , comprehensive metabolic profile , bone specific alkaline phosphatase ( bone remodel marker ) , phosphorus transglutaminase IgA ( rule celiac disease ) , DXA scan bone mineral density ( BMD ) measurement do . The BMD DXA 25-hydroxyvitamin D correlate protein , calcium vitamin D intake obtain Block 2014 .</detailed_description>
