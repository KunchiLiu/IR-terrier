	<brief_summary>Background : Psoriasis , common inflammatory disease , associate atherosclerotic vascular disease , include stroke , myocardial infarction , impaired microcirculations , among circulate microparticles play important role . In severe psoriasis , increase endothelial- platelet- microparticles reduce TNF-Î± blocker parallel clinical improvement . However , whether Stelara ( ustekinumab ) treatment would decrease level microparticles remain unknown . Objective : The investigator evaluate level microparticles among normal control , severe psoriasis 4 month ustekinumab treatment .</brief_summary>
