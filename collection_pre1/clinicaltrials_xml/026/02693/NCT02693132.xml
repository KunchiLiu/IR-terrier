	<brief_title>Comparison Supervised Unsupervised Physical Activity Programs During Weight Loss Intervention Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 69 % U.S. adult population overweight , define body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 25.0 kg/m2 , 35 % obese ( BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2 ) , prevalence overweight obesity rise drastically past several decade . Adults overweight obese typically recommended change lifestyle factor ( e.g . diet , physical activity , etc . ) lose weight improve health . When evaluate effect lifestyle change weight health research setting , physical activity supervise ( i.e . physical activity complete health-fitness facility direct supervision train staff ) . With supervised physical activity , researcher able quantify frequency , intensity , duration , type physical activity . Thus , supervise physical activity consider gold-standard evaluate effect physical activity weight physiological parameter . However , result supervise physical activity trial may translate clinical setting . A typical clinical approach prescribes physical activity unsupervised manner ( i.e . physician tell patient physically active take steps/day ) . Unsupervised physical activity do environment time best suit individual . Knowing effect unsupervised physical activity important translation type physical activity non-research setting . Therefore , know magnitude physiological effect unsupervised physical activity compare supervised physical activity prescribe intensity dose clinical public health importance especially overweight obese population . This study design provide insight important research question inform future research application clinical , public health , health-fitness setting . Participants randomize one three group : supervised physical activity prescribe min/week ( SUP-PA ) , unsupervised physical activity prescribe min/week ( UNSUP-PA ) , unsupervised physical activity prescribe steps/day ( STEP ) . Participants three group participate behavioral weight loss intervention include dietary counsel weekly group session 12-week program . SUP-PA prescribed 150 minutes/week moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) complete direct supervision train staff designate health-fitness facility . UNSUP-PA prescribed physical activity dose match SUP-PA . STEP prescribe 10,000 step/day recommendation 2,500 step complete `` brisk '' pace . The primary aim study compare effect three group moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) accumulate bout least 10 minute . The primary outcome assess baseline , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 . Secondary aim trial include compare light intensity physical activity , sedentary time , cardiorespiratory fitness , weight , body composition , waist circumference measure , physical activity self-efficacy , blood pressure , dietary intake across three group . Secondary aim assess baseline week 12 .</detailed_description>
