	<brief_summary>Despite advance classification treatment , acute leukemia remain incurable disease majority patient . It necessary identify new prognostic marker survival new therapeutic target improve prognosis . Some study show Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-ligand ( FLT3-L ) could interest . A recent study group test novel therapy acute lymphoblastic leukemia , show increase marker blood patient respond treatment . The aim prospective , non-interventional study measure plasma level FLT3-L different time management patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia also myeloid . For , analyze sample collect usual care conduct study relationship plasma concentration FLT3-L outcome . If link , FLT3-L could serve predictor treatment response .</brief_summary>
