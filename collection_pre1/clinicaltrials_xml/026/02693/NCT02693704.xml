	<brief_summary>This study investigate possible benefit use binaural spatialization technique digital wireless microphone system hear aid . Speech intelligibility test , speaker localization test preference test perform . The result diotic ( current rendering ) binaural ( suggested rendering ) rendering compare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Binaural Spatialization Method Hearing Aids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The signal processing laboratory ( LTS2 ) Swiss Federal Institute Technology ( EPFL ) develop new feature sound render hearing aid . This collaboration EPFL Swiss company Phonak Communications AG . The new functionality work range Roger product Phonak , new generation FM system use digital transmission . FM technology refers type wireless system help people well understand speech noisy situation . FM system commonly work together user 's hear aid , although system also available otherwise normal hearing ( people suffer APD , ADHD etc. ) . An FM system work like : person speak wear hold transmitter microphone , transmitter place middle group ( pick speech around ) . Using harmless radio wave , FM system send speech signal ( ) listener , wear tiny FM receiver behind ear . The new feature system perform process speaker 's speech signal render information relate spatial location . This so-called sound `` spatialization '' natural property human binaural auditory system , allow u localize sound . However , sound spatialization deliver current FM system . Thanks new technology EPFL Phonak , possible include binaural spatialization speech signal Roger product Phonak hearing device .</detailed_description>
