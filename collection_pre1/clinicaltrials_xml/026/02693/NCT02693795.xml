	<brief_summary>Left ventricular ( LV ) remodel follow myocardial infarction ( MI ) establish prognostic factor adverse cardiovascular event lead cause heart failure . Empirical observation suggest Baduanjin exercise , important component traditional Chinese Qigong , exert potential impact cardiopulmonary function . However , impact Baduanjin exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program patient recover recent MI yet assess . The aim trail evaluate whether Baduanjin exercise would prevent maladaptive progression adverse LV remodel patient follow MI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Baduanjin Exercise Prevents Post-Myocardial Infarction Left Ventricular Remodeling ( BE-PREMIER Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase evidence indicates exercise MI associate decrease LV end-diastolic/ systolic volume increase LV ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , improvement activity tolerance quality life , reduction overall cardiovascular-related mortality . However , account heterogeneity exercise intervention , limitation methodology , vary characteristic study population , trial report post-MI exercise alter LV remodel cardiac function . Thus , strict randomize controlled study need evaluate benefit exercise MI provide indisputable evidence guideline health professional . As important component Chinese Qigong exercise , Baduanjin exercise origins ancient martial art practice thousand year . It combination moderate-intensity physical activity , meditation , body awareness , design improve holistic health . Baduanjin exercise systematically exert movable joint muscle , enhance cardiopulmonary function , concurrently modulate mind spirit , ultimately achieve integration mind body . Many clinical study demonstrate beneficial effect Baduanjin exercise decrease cholesterol triglyceride concentration , control systemic hypertension , stabilize glucose glycosylated hemoglobin level . Some review article describe Baduanjin exercise therapy potential exert positive impact cardiopulmonary function . Additionally , several recent study prove benefit Baduanjin exercise include prevent ischemic stroke , relieve pain stiffness , improve sleep quality psychological well-being . However , know Baduanjin exercise could feasible approach post-MI individual scientific basis intervention limit . To address research gap , BE-PREMIER ( Baduanjin Exercise PREvents post-Myocardial Infarction leave vEntricular Remodeling ) trial design assess LV remodel clinically stable post-MI patient 12-week period Baduanjin exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
