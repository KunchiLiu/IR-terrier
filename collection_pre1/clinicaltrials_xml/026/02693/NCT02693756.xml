	<detailed_description>Gait stability reduce early age 40 50 . Gait stability improve patient neurological disease healthy elderly person exercise . There evidence mental practice , also call motor imagery , imagination perform movement , also improve activity balance . The effective performance imagination task activate overlap central area neural network , might explain improvement motor imagery . These `` non-physical kind training '' modality could use patient immobilized temporarily ( bedridden non-chronic disease , infection etc . ) , allow charge leg normally ( e.g . postoperative phase joint replacement fracture ) , use combination physical exercise , preparation physical exercise training ( either skilling phase preparation increase safety physical exercise ) . In person 40 year age , motor imagery could provide sound exercise modality task easy perform real performance . For example , walk slippery underground ice , walk small trail altitude , avoid run dog cat sidewalk , catch stumble either difficult exercise reality might dangerous reality . Imaging one 's performance difficult environment situation might lead good gait stability , improve reaction situation thus probably reduce falls frequency . Gait stability estimate local dynamic stability , base chaos theory , i.e . maximal Lyapunov exponent , strongly influenced sensorimotor balance system widely use measure gait stability . In future , investigator plan large scale randomize open label cross-over study test whether nine session motor imagery improve walk stability , measure Lyapunov Exponent . To prepare future study , investigator set test feasibility study feasibility study use open label randomize cross-over trial include 32 person age 40 year . The primary aim evaluate whether instruction clear , intervention study procedure acceptable assess proportion participant withdraw study ( drop out ) . Secondary aim assessment group difference change gait stability .</detailed_description>
