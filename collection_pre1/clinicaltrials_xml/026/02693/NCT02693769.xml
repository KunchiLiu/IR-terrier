	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether fluticasone/formoterol Breath actuate inhaler effective well tolerate treatment subject fix airflow obstruction elevate eosinophil .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Fluticasone /Formoterol Breath Actuated Inhaler ( BAI ) Ultibro Subjects With Fixed Airflow Obstruction Elevated Eosinophils</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design provide efficacy safety data use fluticasone/formoterol Breath actuate inhaler subject characteristic fix airflow obstruction elevate eosinophil . These patient typically exclude previous Flutiform pMDI asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) trial ; example asthma study , patient smoke history 10 pack year exclude , conversely COPD study patient prior history asthma exclude . It expect data study provide great understanding effect fluticasone/formoterol patient population</detailed_description>
