	<brief_summary>This research study study radiation therapy possible treatment meningioma tumor line brain . The study drug intervention involve research study Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy ( IMPT )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Increased Dose Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy ( IMPT ) High-Grade Meningiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II clinical trial . Researchers try find use increased-dose intensity modulate proton therapy ( IMPT ) treatment Meningiomas effective current treatment . The intensity modulate part IMPT allow even good concentration radiation dose desire target less dose surround normal tissue even traditional passive scatter proton therapy . Proton beam regulate stop within shortly beyond treatment target . Therefore little exposure normal tissue radiation . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve IMPT treatment disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must either : histologically confirm atypical meningioma , WHO grade II , Simpson grade 45 either subtotally resect biopsied . OR histologically confirm malignant/anaplastic meningioma , WHO grade III prior surgery . In case recurrent radiographically gross disease , pathologic diagnosis may time original biopsy and/or surgery . Pathology review confirm Participating Institution . Patients may may neurofibromatosis type 1 2 . Age 18 year old . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60 , see Appendix A ) The effect proton radiation therapy develop human fetus know teratogenic . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion proton therapy . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants may receive investigational agent . Participants may receive prior cranial irradiation . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant lactate woman exclude study radiation know teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother radiation therapy , breastfeed discontinue mother treated radiation therapy . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 3 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 3 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin .</criteria>
