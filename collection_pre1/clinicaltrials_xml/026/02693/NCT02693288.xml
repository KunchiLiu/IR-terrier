	<brief_summary>Distal radial fracture reparation volar plat often manage regional anaesthesia , associate severe pain block end . Acute post-operative pain may delay rehabilitation , even risk factor development chronic pain . The use opioids inevitable opioid-related side effect decrease patient satisfaction . A multimodal approach pain management include local regional analgesia technique possible . In case wrist fracture , two method available : peripheral nerve block anaesthesiologist surgical site local infiltration surgeon long-acting local aesthetic . Both technique commonly use management postoperative pain diverse orthopaedic surgery . The purpose study determine equivalence ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block local infiltration surgeon short-term postoperative analgesia surgical reparation isolate closed wrist fracture volar plat regional anaesthesia . The quality postoperative pain , patient satisfaction adverse event record first 48 hour follow surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Efficacity Analgesia Between Ultrasound-guided Nerve Block Local Infiltration After Wrist Fracture Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients allocate treatment group accord computer-generated randomisation sequence bloc . Randomization obtain data record electronic report form ( URC Robert Debre ) . Demographic medical information obtain pre-operative anaesthesia consultation keep rest patient 's write file . All intervention carry regional anaesthesia consist ultrasound-guided axillary block 25-35 mL lidocaine 1,5 % epinephrine , target median , ulnar , radial , musculocutaneous lateral cutaneous nerve . The analgesic intervention realise accord group allocation , end surgery : skin closure make cast . To ensure blind patient , surgical sterile drape keep end analgesic intervention - In peripheral nerve block group ( BN ) , anaesthesiologist perform ultrasound-guided block median radial nerve low third arm . Each nerve encircle 10 mL ropivacaine 0,475 % . - In local infiltration group ( INF ) , surgeon inject 10mL ropivacaine 0,75 % directly peri-fracture tissue : fracture site , tendon synovial sheath hypodermis dermis regard surgical incision . An operating room aesthetic nurse time duration realisation analgesic intervention . The intensity proximal motor nerve block record patient discharge post anaesthesia care unit , use modify Bromage Scale . In group pain management standardise : post anaesthesia care unit ( PACU ) patient receive 1g acetaminophen 550mg naproxen ( NSAID ) well 20 mg omeprazole give orally . This treatment continue orthopaedic ward , every 6 hour acetaminophen , 12 hour naproxen every day omeprazole . If pain score reach 3/10 , rescue medication give : 10 mg oral morphine sulphate , available every 6 hour . Upon discharge , patient give prescription medication two day clear instruction use rescue opioids . The patient ask record pain score 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 hour , opioid consumption , opioid related adverse event , quality sleep satisfaction pain management document intend purpose . The pain score record use Numeric Rating scale pain range 0 ( pain ) 10 ( bad possible pain ) . Total opioid consumption assess milligram . Quality sleep well patient satisfaction pain management record use numerical rating scale range 0 10 . Interns medical practitioner unaware patient allocation collect data . If patient discharge within 2 day , data recover telephone . The anonymized data record electronic report form . All electronic data declare CNIL ( French National Committee Data protection Liberties ) . According preliminary data , standard deviation mean duration analgesia first 48 postoperative hour 108 minute . We choose set equivalence margin 90 minute , seem clinically relevant describe difference duration analgesia patient . With risk alpha = 5 % beta = 10 % 10 % patient expect assessable , estimated number patient include 72 ( 36 group ) . As study aim show equivalence , per-protocol analysis carry first intention . An intention-to-treat analysis follow ass result ' reliability treatment 's efficiency . Patient characteristic describe two group . The primary study endpoint delay analgesic intervention occurrence pain score great 3/10 first 48 postoperative hour . The equivalence margin 90 minute consider clinically relevant , define equivalence interval -90 + 90 minute . If confidence interval difference analgesia duration two technique include interval , two technique consider equivalent . On contrary confidence interval difference partially include included interval , conclude non-equivalence . The secondary end-points include superiority analysis . - The mean difference duration realisation analgesic intervention compare use Student 's t-test non-parametric test . - The intensity proximal motor block assess modify Bromage Scale compare use chi-squared test Fischer 's exact test . - The number patient numerical pain rating â‰¤ 3 , number patient require opioids , frequency opioid-related adverse event first 48 postoperative hour quality sleep first night numeric scale 0 10 compare use chi-squared test Fischer 's exact test . - Total opioid consumption ( milligram ) well patient satisfaction pain management first 48 postoperative hour compare use Student 's t-test non-parametric test . - The pain score record 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 hour postoperatively describe graphic analysis compare use mixed model reflect repeat measure .</detailed_description>
