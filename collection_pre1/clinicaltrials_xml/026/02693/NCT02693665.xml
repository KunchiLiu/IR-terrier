	<detailed_description>The investigator propose prospective , longitudinal , 2-arm RCT test efficacy FACE-TC key measurable outcome 18 month post-intervention . Dyads compose adolescent cancer family ( N=130 dyads ; 260 subject ) enrol randomize either FACE-TC intervention Treatment Usual ( TAU ) Control group ratio 2:1 [ N=87 FACE-TC dyad N=43 TAU Control dyads ] . The investigator estimate 30 % attrition 18 month post-intervention assessment ( 20 % -25 % due death/complications 10 % due dropout ) . Of original sample 130 randomize dyad ( N=260 subject ) , investigator estimate investigator full longitudinal data 18 month post-intervention 91 dyad ( N=182 subject ) . Participants recruit Akron Children 's Hospital St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital pediatric oncology program . Participants undergo write informed consent/assent . Study sit maintain documentation participant ' consent . Eligible participant enrol complete baseline assessment follow randomization . Randomization level dyad . Allocation conceal RA-Assessor prevent bias . Block randomization study site control site difference . Intervention Control Conditions : The curriculum base FACE-TC consists : The Session 1 ACP Survey ; Session 2 Respecting Choices Interview ; Session 3 Five Wishes advance directive . To minimize burden ill adolescent , investigator choose Treatment Usual comparison condition . This group provide advance care plan booklet/information . Assessments occur baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 month post-intervention . At site assessment intervention administer research team comprise site Co-Investigator two Research Assistants ( RA ) ( RA-Assessor &amp; RA-Interventionist ) .Visit protocol : Screening Visit : The RA-Assessor present adolescent cancer family Information Sheet describe study conduct initial assessment whether eligible enrollment . After consent/assent , screen inclusion/exclusion criterion conduct . Baseline Visit : At enrollment prior randomization , baseline measure obtain . Entry baseline data RA-Assessor trigger computerized randomization patient/family dyads either FACE-TC intervention TAU Control use randomly permute block design 2:1 ratio study site . The Children 's National clinical coordinator notify RA-Interventionist schedule next study visit . The adolescent family learn assignment RA-Interventionist call schedule study session . Attendance record assess effect full vs. partial participation FACE-TC . Follow-up Visits : RA-Assessor obtain follow-up measure adolescent family 3 , 6 , 12 18 month post intervention . Site Co-Is oversee site activity provide weekly , face-to-face supervision RAs . They responsible recruitment , retention , safety , fidelity protocol , supervision support RAs . The RAs assist recruitment , screening , enrollment baseline screen measure collection , well day-to-day functioning . RAs blind random assignment . RA-Interventionists trained implement protocol . Only RA-Assessor permit administer post-randomization assessment . Children 's National serve data coordinate center responsible database design maintenance statistical analysis . Sites overseen Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) . A 2-day Investigator Meeting hold Washington , District Columbia ( DC ) include site Co-Is , RA-Assessors consultant . The protocol , scientific rationale , underlie ethic issue , implementation include recruitment retention , review entire team . In month 9 Year 1 3-day train meet RA-Interventionists RA-Assessors intervention , site-Co-Is also attend . RA-Assessors attend one day train order maintain blindness . Site Initiation . To begin screening/enrollment ( 1 ) protocol must approve site 's Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) personnel must certify Human Subjects Research training , ( 2 ) personnel recruit trained RA role , ( 3 ) RA-Interventionist must complete certification Next Steps-ACP Facilitator . Dr. Lyon Research Coordinator verify site component place logistics screen , enrol , scheduling , perform assessment , administer intervention , collect data . To assure continuous quality intervention evaluation , monitor ongoing . Dr. Lyon Ms. Briggs review first 5 DVD/audio recording intervention session site ensure fidelity protocol . Thereafter , randomly review 1 DVD per week , rotate site . Dr. Lyon Ms. Briggs use competency checklist . Dr. Lyon Research Coordinator monitor ongoing site IRB approval documentation assist sit annual continue review . The Research Coordinator keep copy regulatory form , include consent-stamped template site staff member ' Human Subjects Research Training approval certificate . Dr. Lyon Research Coordinator perform twice yearly site monitor visit intervention implement assure standardization procedure resolve problem identify . They review confirm consent occur properly sit site maintain participant regulatory data . The REDCap database FACE-TC pilot update expanded study , system data entry revise address multi-site implementation . A data dictionary create . An external Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) assemble Dr. Lyon responsibility review safety information , study progress , relevant data . The SMC meet minimum year . Prior parametric testing , scale reliability multi-item measure ( e.g. , pain/fatigue , child parent psychological , spiritual/religious measure ) assess use Cronbach 's alpha composite score use data analysis . Analytical Plan AIM 1 . To evaluate efficacy FACE-TC adolescent-family congruence treatment preference . Congruence decision-making medical treatment test base agreement ( i.e. , patient his/her family choose option ) Statement Treatment Preferences four different cancer-related situation . Kappa coefficient apply assess chance-adjusted agreement patient family response . Change Kappa coefficient ( congruence improvement ) baseline follow-up time point study period test use bootstrapping technique . The latent growth model ( LGM ) categorical outcome use test Hypotheses H1a , i.e. , FACE-TC participant high congruence rate time . In LGM , investigator set time score , except identification purpose , free parameter let shape growth trajectory determine data . As , congruence development trajectory would empirically base nonlinear shape , instead assume linear nonlinear polynomial function . The investigator apply growth mixture model ( GMM ) test heterogeneity congruence development trajectory identify possible pattern congruence development trajectory full sample . The latent class variable estimate GMM capture pattern congruence development trajectory . Time-invariant covariates use predict membership latent trajectory group ; time-varying covariates include predict level congruence different time point . To test Hypotheses H1b , investigator regress latent growth slope factor latent class variable FACE-TC intervention , control covariates GMM assess 1 ) FACE-TC would affect membership latent class congruence development ; 2 ) effect FACE-TC congruence change time varies across latent trajectory class . Analytical Plan AIM 2 . To evaluate efficacy FACE-TC AYA quality life family QOL . The LGM GMM model propose evaluate Aim 1 readily apply evaluate Aim 2 test Hypotheses H2 outcome measure continuous variable . When examine effect FACE-TC QOL AYAs cancer family , socio-demographics control time-invariant covariates , time-varying covariates include model predict measure QOL different time point . In addition , family caregiver appraisal/depression measure end study period include distal outcome GMM model , distal outcome associate pattern developmental trajectory AYA QOL assess . As model use evaluate multiple outcome , Bonferroni correction apply exert stringent control false discovery . As attrition inevitable longitudinal study , robust model estimator ( e.g. , MLR ) use full information maximum likelihood use model estimation . Importantly , miss random ( MAR ) , instead miss completely random , assume MLR . MAR plausible assumption allow missingness dependent observe measure like intervention assignment . Analytical Plan AIM 3 . To evaluate efficacy FACE-TC early completion pACP goal care advance directive . First , investigator use two-proportion z-test test difference proportion completion pACP goal care advance directive FACE-TC control group . Then logistic regression use test Hypothesis H3 , control socio-demographics . Interaction intervention ethnicity include model test ethnic disparity regard intervention efficacy . The investigator also explore FACE-TC improves match patient ' goal care medical care receive EOL among adolescent may die . Descriptive statistic use estimate frequency study variable . Chi-square statistic Fisher Exact test use assess difference match FACE-TC control ; exact logistic regression apply examine effect FACE-TC match , control covariates . For continuous outcome modest observation autocorrelation ( p=0.20 ) moderate effect size ( delta=0.35 ) , estimate sample size achieve power 0.80 =0.05 level detect moderate effect size ( delta=0.35 ) N=76 individual 5 observation time point . For binary outcome , sample size N=70 achieve power 0.80 detect moderate response probability difference d=0.17 give p=0.20 . Our propose sample N=130 dyads ensure large enough statistical power propose longitudinal analysis patient data parent data , respectively . For cross-sectional logistic regression model propose evaluate Aim 3 , sample size N=100 would achieve power 0.83 alpha=0.05 level detect odds ratio 4 .</detailed_description>
