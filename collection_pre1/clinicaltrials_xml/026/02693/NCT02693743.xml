	<brief_summary>Suicide responsible almost 40,000 death 2011 America . It still singularly difficult predict go commit suicide establish adequate intervention . Growing evidence support view suicide associate poor decision making . Suicide hypothesize trigger stressful situation create overwhelming psychological pain individual chooses terminate his/her life , disregard future consequence . We previously demonstrate reward impulsive choice common recent suicide attempter suicidal depressed patient ( 1 ) . Consistent finding , hypothesize high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) leave prefrontal cortex improve impulsive response tendency measure delay discount procedure , turn associate faster resolution suicidal ideation .

	<detailed_description>The propose study seek improve prevention suicide advance understand neurobiology suicide use randomize control trial repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) hypothesis drive intervention acute suicidality . In 2010 suicide responsible 38,364 death United States 447 state Arkansas ( CDC , 2012 ) . Suicide represent 10th lead cause death country , claim death chronic liver disease , hypertension , Parkinson 's disease homicide . Furthermore , suicide consequence extend beyond termination individual 's life impact leave behind . These statistic far alarm believe underestimate , substantial number suicide suicide attempt undetected misclassified . The high rise prevalence suicide complicate clinical challenge identify patient high risk suicide . A variety biological , psychological social risk factor suicide identify . However , currently lack reliable predictor suicide risk must rely heavily upon self-report clinical judgment . Thus , remain singularly difficult predict go commit suicide . Therefore , urgent unmet need develop effective early detection method treatment high-risk population . Suicide describe `` permanent solution temporary problem '' ( Buchwald , 2006 ) , reflect view suicide result poor decision making . The strong biological finding suicide research association reduce serotonergic neurotransmission , particularly within ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( VMPFC ) ( Mann , 2003 ) . This deficit serotonergic neurotransmission think impair cognition , predispose patient become impulsive , rigid thinking , poor decision maker . Decisions depress state taint negative affect distort negative cognition ( Martin-Soelch , 2009 ) . However , suicide associate cognitive impairment go beyond depression . Asymptomatic patient history suicide attempt exhibit significant cognitive deficit suggestive generalized prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) dysfunction ( Raust et al , 2007 ; Westheide et al , 2008 ) , corollary disruption risk assessment ( Martino et al , 2010 ) . Poor inhibition find suicide attempter compare patient suicidal ideation ( Burton et al , 2011 ) , great cognitive impairment find depressed patient suicidal ideation compare without ( Dombrovski et al , 2010 ) . It possible cognitive deficit may specific suicidal behavior rather comorbid specific psychiatric diagnosis observation hold true suicidal patient depression , bipolar disorder , even temporal lobe epilepsy . However , study perform symptom-free patient , often month year presence suicidal ideation behavior . In previous report ( Cáceda et al , 2014 ) demonstrate inability delay gratification ( choose small immediate reward large delayed reward ) share recent suicide attempter depress patient suicidal ideation . On follow assessment , 5-10 day suicide attempt , reduction suicidal ideation intent correlate decreased symptom depression recovery delay gratification impairment ( Cáceda et al , 2014 ) . These data congruent hypothesis stressful situation combination biological psychological predisposition may create critical climate overwhelming psychological pain individual chooses impulsive escapist strategy terminate his/her life discounting future outcome ( Vohs et al , 2002 ) . However , underlie neural mechanism remain unknown therefore amenable therapeutic intervention . TMS noninvasive method cause depolarization hyperpolarization neuron brain use electromagnetic induction induce weak electric current use rapidly change magnetic field . TMS novel intervention develop field neurology use treatment patient suffer migraine , stroke , Parkinson 's disease , tinnitus depression . In healthy subject , high frequency rTMS leave DLPFC show alter impulsive choice behavior ( decrease delay discounting ) healthy individual smoker ( Sheffer et al , 2013 ) . On hand , trial TMS one leader field show safe well tolerated recent suicide attempter suffer depression comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder traumatic brain injury ( George et al , 2014 ) . Dr. Mennemeier , director Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Laboratory Center Translational Neuroscience use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) understand treat phantom sound perception subject tinnitus examine risky choice impulsive behavior use delay discounting smoker . We propose replicate randomize control trial rTMS 3 day sample well characterize acutely suicidal inpatient . Our overall hypothesis 10 Hertz rTMS leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) correct impulsive choice behavior deficit find acutely suicidal patient turn translate fast resolution acute suicidal ideation . The current proposal expand understand neurobiology suicidal behavior examine potential neurocognitive mechanism acute suicidality test value rTMS intervention acute suicidal behavior . The current proposal utilize behavioral assessment rTMS randomize controlled trial group adult patient hospitalize : ) follow recent suicide attempt persistent suicidal ideation , b ) severe suicidal ideation ( n=20 ) . Specifically , propose : Specific Aim 1 . Determine safety repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) depress patient severe suicidal ideation . Hypothesis 1 : Given study rTMS clinical depression , investigator predict rTMS patient severe suicidal ideation well tolerate associate significant side effect . Specific Aim 2 . Determine effect rTMS delay discounting depress patient severe suicidal ideation . Hypothesis 2 : In depressed patient severe suicidal ideation rTMS active reduce impulsive choice behavior ( measure delay discount ) compare non-treatment group . Specific Aim 3 . Determine effect rTMS suicidal ideation depress patient severe suicidal ideation . Hypothesis 3.1 : In depressed patient recently attempt suicide rTMS active group reduce suicidal ideation severity ( measure Beck Scale Suicidal Ideation ) compare non-treatment group . Hypothesis 3.2 : Suicidal ideation depress patient recently attempt suicide vary function delay discounting . Specific Aim 4 . Identification biomarkers positive response rTMS depress patient severe suicidal ideation . Hypothesis 4 : A composite serum hormonal inflammatory marker predict positive response rTMS depress patient severe suicidal ideation</detailed_description>
