	<brief_title>The Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familiar hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) common genetic disorder associate development severe premature coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The disorder cause mutation gene encode low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDL-r ) , result low expression functional LDL-r liver . FH autosomal dominant transmission high penetrance prevalence heterozygous individual one 400 500 general population . To date , 800 different functional mutation LDL-r gene describe worldwide , 200 document Spain . In addition , much less common disorder resemble FH familial defective apoB 100 disorder ( FDB ) produce mutation Apo B 100 gene . FDB account significant proportion FH localize region Spain . Life expectancy shorten 20 30 year FH patient , sudden death myocardial infarction principal cause death . The Simon Broome Register FH Great Britain , show FH 100-fold increase coronary mortality nearly 10-fold increase total mortality , especially young adult . Since 1990 's , coronary mortality total mortality FH patient decrease remarkably part due use effective lipid-lowering therapy statin . The analysis Dutch FH cohort show early treatment statin diagnosis disorder lead near normalisation coronary heart disease risk comparable general population . Therefore , patient require early , continuous intensive lipid-lowering therapy . Despite use statin , population still high risk development premature CAD . Therefore , need study relatives know FH case , know cascade screening , essential detect case young , probably less severe form FH receiving treatment prevent cardiovascular disease development . Although genetic defect probably important factor clinical expression FH , genetic ( gene-gene interaction ) , environmental ( particularly relate diet , tobacco consumption physical activity ) metabolic factor could play important role modulate atherosclerotic burden population . To gain insight prognostic factor mechanisms influence development CAD mortality FH , long-term prospective follow-up molecularly well-defined FH cohort use multidisciplinary approach necessary . This cohort excellent tool translational research evaluate determine principal prognostic factor relate CAD morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
