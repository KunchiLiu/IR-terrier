	<criteria>18 year age old Histologicallyproven locally advance metastatic solid tumor , multiple myeloma B cell nonHodgkin lymphoma longer benefit standard anticancer treatment , opinion treat physician , treatment available indicated Performance status 02 ( Per Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) criterion ) Patients must acceptable organ function define . However , note , drugspecific inclusion/exclusion criterion specify protocol appendix agent take precedence inclusion criterion : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 106/µl 2 . Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dl 3 . Platelets &gt; 75,000/µl 4 . Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/ dl 5 . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( &lt; 5 x ULN patient know hepatic metastasis ) 6 . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN calculate measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 Patients must measurable evaluable disease ( per RECIST v1.1 solid tumor , Lugano criterion non Hodgkin lymphoma International Myeloma Working Group criteria multiple myeloma ) , define , per RECIST 1.1 , least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , subcutaneous superficial lesion measure caliper clinical exam . For lymph node , short axis must ≥15 mm . Patients assessable disease physical radiographic examination meet definition measurable disease eligible consider evaluable disease . Patient 's whose disease objectively measure physical radiographic examination ( e.g. , elevated serum tumor marker ) NOT eligible Results must available genomic test immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) test protein expression perform Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) certify , College American Pathologists ( CAP ) accredit , New York State accredit ( labs offering service resident NY ) laboratory register test National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Genetic Test Registry establish integration TAPUR platform . The genomic IHC test use qualify patient participation TAPUR may perform specimen patient 's tumor obtain point patient 's care discretion patient 's treating physician . Genomic assay perform cellfree DNA plasma ( `` liquid biopsy '' ) also acceptable genomic analysis perform laboratory meet criteria describe . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Have tumor genomic profile single agent treatment one FDA approve targeted anticancer drug include study potential clinical benefit base criterion describe protocol For orally administer drug , patient must able swallow tolerate oral medication must know malabsorption syndrome Because risk drug treatment develop fetus , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation , four month follow completion study therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participate study partner male participant study become pregnant participate study , inform partner 's treat physician immediately well obstetrician . Female study patient become pregnant must immediately discontinue treatment study therapy . Male patient avoid impregnate female partner . Male study patient , even surgically sterilize , ( i.e . postvasectomy ) must agree one following : practice effective barrier contraception entire study treatment period 4 month last dose study drug , completely abstain sexual intercourse Note : TAPUR explicitly exclude type solid tumor , patient must measurable evaluable disease per RECIST v1.1 Patients whose disease measurable assessed radiographic image physical examination ( e.g. , elevated serum tumor marker ) eligible Patients primary brain tumor exclude . Patients know progressive brain metastasis determine serial image decline neurologic function opinion treat physician eligible . Patients previously treat brain metastasis eligible , provide patient experienced seizure clinically significant change neurological status within 3 month prior registration . All patient previously treat brain metastasis must clinically stable least 1 month completion treatment steroid treatment one month prior study enrollment . Note : additional exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
