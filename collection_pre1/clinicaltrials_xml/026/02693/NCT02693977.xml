	<brief_summary>Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) associate heavy snoring brief pause breathe sleep . It affect least 1-3 % general pediatric population great prevalence among certain high risk group child obesity , Down syndrome , craniofacial anomaly , neuromuscular disorder . Several study show , even adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) , approximately 30 % child continue struggle OSA . They find old child ( age &gt; 7 yr ) , obesity , high pre-operative OSA severity risk factor contribute residual OSA . Despite know risk factor , ability predict individual patient 's risk residual OSA tonsil surgery difficult . Determining tool best predict residual OSA important step towards effective post-surgery OSA management . The purpose study determine whether sleep endoscopy predict whether AT successful treatment OSA . Our hypothesis subject multiple area obstruction addition large tonsil likely residual OSA AT . Sleep endoscopy procedure perform drug-induced sleep involves pass flexible endoscope subject 's nose back throat look source obstruction breathe spontaneously . This prospective cohort study examine subject age 2 18 AT treatment obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) consider high risk residual OSA surgery . High risk define base follow criterion : obesity , Down syndrome , African American race , severe baseline OSA , age &gt; 7 yr . Eligible subject recruit pediatric otolaryngology clinic time initial evaluation AT . Subjects undergo sleep endoscopy moderate sedation time AT . All patient ask complete preoperative sleep study confirm diagnosis OSA postoperative sleep study determine impact AT presence residual OSA .

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether sleep endoscopy perform high-risk pediatric patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) time adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) predict whether AT successful initial treatment OSA . We hypothesize patient multiple site obstruction addition adenotonsillar hypertrophy ( e.g . nasal airway , velum , base tongue , supraglottis ) likely residual sleep apnea postoperative sleep testing . Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome OSAS define symptomatic repetitive obstruction upper airway sleep estimate affect 1-6 % general pediatric population . Untreated OSAS child associate childhood hypertension , autonomic dysfunction , attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder , neurobehavioral impairment , poor quality life . These sequelae contribute 226 % increase health care utilization among child OSAS compare control , primarily form increase hospitalization , emergency department visit , medication use . Adenotonsillar hypertrophy consider common risk factor OSAS child , therefore unlike adult OSAS , adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) recommend first line treatment . In large part due increase awareness diagnosis pediatric OSAS , incidence AT increase dramatically 1980 2005 . With 500,000 procedure perform per year , AT second-most common procedure perform child US , 77 % OSAS primary indication . Current guideline recommend AT first line treatment pediatric OSAS even patient may significant risk post-AT OSAS . Estimates prevalence persistent OSAS AT vary widely due use different polysomnographic criterion diagnosis . Studies assess risk post-AT OSAS use conservative adult threshold diagnosis demonstrate even high threshold least 13-29 % child undergo AT pediatric OSAS significant residual disease approximately 75 % child fail achieve normalization polysomnography . Specific population patient recognize particularly risk post-AT OSAS include severe baseline OSAS , Down syndrome , obesity , age &gt; 7 year . In obese patient , prevalence post-AT OSAS report high 73-88 % . Since obesity triple last three decade affect approximately 8 % child age 2-5 year , 18 % child age 6-11 21 % adolescent age 12-19 year , problem persistent OSAS AT likely continue grow . Even within population risk AT failure , wide variation treatment response . One study morbidly obese child undergo AT demonstrate 37 % cure rate 53 % sufficient residual OSAS require treatment continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . However , significant baseline difference identify surgical responder non-responders . The mechanism failure population unclear , presume increase generalized adiposity lead multilevel obstruction similar obese adult , thus decrease likelihood success AT . Similarly poor still variable response AT observe child Down syndrome post-AT success vary 18 % 55 % depend specific criterion use . There study clearly identify predictor AT outcome within Down syndrome population , however , study Down syndrome patient fail AT suggest multilevel obstruction common . Thus , although specific population patient know great risk post-AT OSAS average , individual characteristic cause persistent disease remain unclear . Accurate prognostication risk residual OSA AT individual patient remain challenge . Studies patient persistent post-AT OSAS suggest multilevel obstruction location besides tonsil adenoid likely contributor , clearly demonstrate . In study , present novel concept build composite model predict outcome AT child OSAS . This model include baseline feature history physical exam also find dynamic sleep-related collapse specific anatomic site pharynx observed sleep endoscopy . This model give insight mechanism airway obstruction well possible reason persistent OSAS AT . A rating scale DISE previously describe attempt standardize reporting endoscopic finding adult OSAS . This rating scale evaluate degree pattern obstruction four level pharynx : Velum ( soft palate ) , Oropharynx ( include tonsil ) , Tongue base , Epiglottis ( VOTE ) . The VOTE rating scale demonstrate moderate substantial inter-rater reliability kappa value range 0.4-0.8 depend specific structure compare . Other investigator utilize modified version VOTE rating scale child , include level airway nasal airway , nasopharynx , supraglottis . One recent study demonstrate sleep endoscopy finding child reliable awake endoscopy note strong correlation polysomnography result overall impression OSA severity endoscopy . Dexmedetomidine , use study , highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist demonstrate result sedate sleep similar natural sleep without cause respiratory depression . Though report transient bradycardia blood pressure change response dexmedetomidine infusion ( usually transient hypotension 10 % slow infusion ) cardiovascular effect mitigate co-administration bolus ketamine . These patient would already use dexmedetomidine different anesthesia tonsil surgery . The dexmedetomidine intervention part study . In preliminary retrospective review patient population surgical volume , examine electronic medical record patient underwent AT 12 month period . 498 patient identify , operate four pediatric otolaryngologist group . Approximately 200 ( 40 % ) perform OSAS patient could consider high risk residual post-AT OSAS would meet inclusion/exclusion criterion describe . Untreated OSA child associate childhood hypertension , autonomic dysfunction , attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder , poor school performance , poor quality life . These sequelae contribute 226 % increase health care utilization among child OSA compare control . Residual OSA AT pediatric population remain serious concern ; patient grows change , airway physiology also change . Although grow body research suggest demographic comorbidity risk factor post-AT residual OSA , ability accurately predict likelihood severity residual OSA give individual remains elusive . Possible tools evaluation post-AT OSA pediatric population include radiologic examination , cine MRI scanning , endoscopic evaluation , along polysomnography , validated questionnaire , physical examination . Determining instrument best predict residual OSA surgical intervention important step towards effective OSA management .</detailed_description>
