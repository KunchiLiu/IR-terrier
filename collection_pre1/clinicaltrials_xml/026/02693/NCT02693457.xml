	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial design determine effect suction drain usage reduction postoperative swell follow total knee replacement . Furthermore , study determine relationship postoperative swell quadriceps muscle function . This study perform cohort patient undergo bilateral total knee replacement suction intra-articular drain randomize one two operative knee prior surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes Following Suction Drain Non-suction Drain Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study two primary aim : 1 ) determine effect intra-articular suction drain use , place total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , postoperative knee joint effusion , collection fluid joint capsule , low extremity swell compare TKA without use intra-articular drain , 2 ) describe relationship postoperative low extremity swell quadriceps function ( strength activation ) . The use intra-articular drain TKA surgery highly dispute , due fear increase risk infection secondary incision site , however , past study find increase risk complication drain use . Furthermore , study show drain use may reduce amount hidden blood loss , blood collect intra-articular space . Of interest , effusion may associate decreased quadriceps function . Previous research examine influence knee effusion quadriceps function show laboratory-induced acute knee effusion , quadriceps activation force production reduce . However , previous finding lack ability inform care patient follow TKA due acute nature effusion inability translate finding healthy individual clinical population . This study potential greatly improve care patient undergo TKA inform surgical procedure also provide important evidence influence postoperative swell quadriceps muscle function . In order maintain patient blinding , non-functional subcutaneous drain place non-randomized knee . Patients blind fluid output intra-articular drain . A medial parapatellar approach utilized exposure knee . All TKAs perform use gap balancing technique substitution posterior collateral ligament ( PCL ) . In case , tensioning device use establish balance , symmetrical flexion extension space . All TKA procedure utilize cemented implant . Randomly assign drain ( intra-articular subcutaneous ) place respective knee closure . All patient treat Tranexamic Acid intravenously standardize blood loss effusion . All patient provide standard rehabilitation protocol inpatient stay . After hospital discharge , patient encourage receive outpatient physical therapy 2-3 time per week 6 week .</detailed_description>
