First Visit : Demographics , Fugl-Meyer Lower Extremity Assessment sensorimotor function , Mini Mental State Examination 6MWT GAITRite measurement use Both type AFO random order . Afterwards participant give one type AFO ( randomly select ) practice walk week . Second Visit : 6MWT GAITRite measurement use type AFO practicing . Then type AFO give practice walk week . Third Visit : 6MWT GAITRite measurement use second type AFO practice week prior . Patient ask type AFO prefer use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Two Different Types Ankle Foot Orthoses Gait Outcomes Patients With Subacute Stroke .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Stroke lead cause death disability world today . About 795,000 people diagnose stroke yearly United States . The annual cost stroke medical service disability nation $ 38.6 billion dollar . Gait rehabilitation important aspect neurorehabilitation focus attain functional symmetrical gait prevent fall faulty gait mechanic , prevent sedentary life style associate comorbidities . Ankle foot orthoses ( AFOs ) commonly prescribed patient stroke address ankle knee instability restore normal safe walk pattern.The effectiveness AFOs various gait parameter report patient stroke , mostly chronic stage recovery . Systematic analysis show use various type ankle foot orthoses improve walk impairment balance , reduce energy cost , improve knee ankle kinematics people chronic stage stroke recovery , great 6 month since onset stroke . It report majority gait improvement occur within first 6 month follow onset stroke . However , limited number study investigate effect AFOs within six month stroke onset . Three report study investigate effect use AFO compare use AFO within 6 month follow onset stroke . Rao et al find use AFO significantly improve gait velocity , cadence step length affect unaffected side . Hyun et al . find use AFO significantly improve VO2 peak 6 minute walk test score . Carse et al show significant improvement walk velocity , average step length cadence use AFO . There one report study look effect use two different type AFOs subacute stage stroke , less 6 month follow onset . Results study show gait speed knee ankle control significantly high Chignon AFO group compare polypropylene AFO group . Additionally , participant Chignon AFO group significantly low spasticity polypropylene AFO group . In recent case series report , investigator observe use custom Double Adjustable AFO early stage recovery stroke result typical muscle activation pattern , gait endurance velocity , near normal symmetry gait without assistive device AFO three participant . The use type AFO gait rehabilitation follow stroke subacute stage thoroughly study . Statement Problem Patients stroke result hemiparesis foot drop affect gait impairment poor symmetry , decrease velocity , decrease endurance . AFOs show effective intervention improve gait parameter individual chronic stage stroke recovery . Although , majority gait improvement occur within six month stroke , effect early bracing different type AFOs gait outcomes investigated thoroughly . Purpose study : The purpose study identify whether patient subacute stage stroke , demonstrate foot drop , good gait outcome use Double Adjustable AFO , Posterior Leaf Spring AFO . A secondary purpose determine whether one week practice significantly change gait outcome either AFO condition . Research Hypotheses The research hypotheses study follow : 1 . There difference gait endurance measurement , gait symmetry measurement gait velocity measurement baseline use custom Double Adjustable AFO compare PLS AFO patient subacute stage stroke . 2 . There difference gait endurance measurement , gait symmetry measurement gait velocity measurement one week practice use custom Double Adjustable AFO compare PLS AFO patient subacute stage stroke . 3 . After week practice , difference gait endurance measurement , gait symmetry measurement gait velocity measurement compare baseline measurement , use either custom Double Adjustable AFO PLS AFO patient subacute stage stroke . Participants Twenty participant age 18 , gender ethnicity , diagnose first time unilateral stroke , 4 - 20 week post-stroke onset , result hemiparesis foot drop recruit . The number participant estimate base previously report study . Hyun et al find significant difference gait endurance measure 6MWT use AFO compare use AFO 15 participant similar study . In another study Carse et al , gait velocity gait symmetry find significantly good 8 participants.Therefore , study , potential participant number project 20 . Participants recruit sample convenience Baylor Institute Rehabilitation location word mouth . The physical therapist location give brief description propose study ask screen potential participant . Participants meet inclusion criterion possess none exclusion criterion ask volunteer study . Each participant read read right human subject ask sign informed consent approve Institutional Review Boards Baylor Health Care System Texas Woman 's University prior enrollment study . A Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) perform determine whether participant cognitive ability sign inform consent . Participants schedule data collection day receive custom double adjustable AFO Baylor Institute Rehabilitation , Frisco location . Procedures : All measurement obtain participant three test session one researcher avoid inter tester reliability issue . On first measurement day , primary investigator collect demographic data include age , height , weight , leg length measurement side , Fugl-Meyer Lower Extremity Assessment sensorimotor function . Then gait outcome measure use one two AFO condition random order . The participant select order AFO condition draw hat . Randomization without replacement use . Once order AFO wearing determine , data collect randomly select order . Participants allow use type assistive device choice , device use condition . First , 6MWT administer participant wear first randomize AFO . Participants ask ambulate far possible 6 minute self-selected walk velocity well-lit indoor corridor . A five minute seat rest provide . Next , gait symmetry gait velocity measurement obtain use GAITRite system . Participants give practice trial walk prior begin test . Participants ask walk comfortable self-selected walking velocity along walkway . They begin walk three meter start walkway stop walk two meter past end walkway . The begin end walk area mark red tape visibility . The verbal instruction `` Please walk red line red line comfortable speed safely '' . A second personnel walk close participant outside walkway ensure safety . After five minute sit break , participant ask walk fast safely . The verbal instruction `` Please walk red line red line fast safely '' . The GAITRite system able capture gait symmetry gait velocity measurement walk . Three trial perform self-selected velocity walk fast paced velocity walk . The calculated mean three trial use data analysis . After 10 minute seat rest break , second AFO condition use measurement repeat order described . To assess effect practice gait measure , AFO 's randomized practice . Participants randomize AFO wear first . Then participant provide select type AFO practice follow week use prescribed wear schedule . At end one-week practice time , primary investigator obtain measurement obtain baseline participant wear type AFO use practice week . The test condition order test use baseline employ . Once measurement complete , participant provide second type AFO ask wear one week use prescribed wear schedule . Final measurement take completion one-week practice use second type AFO testing condition order . At conclusion test participant ask AFO prefer use . Data Analysis : Descriptive statistic calculate demographic data include age , height , weight , time since onset Fugl Meyer low extremity assessment score AFO preference . Differences gait endurance analyze use 2x2 repeated measure ANOVA Differences gait symmetry , gait velocity two AFO condition two practice condition analyze use two separate 2x2 repeat measure MANOVA . If assumption sphericity meet , Greenhouse-Geisser statistic use . An alpha level .05 use determine significance difference , Bonferroni correction apply need protect Type I error .</detailed_description>
