	<brief_summary>Significant advance primary malignant brain tumor ( PBT ) treatment lead dramatically improve survival , child adult . However , survival come without cost aggressive treatment method associate significant long-term adverse effect , often refer `` late effect '' ( Panigrahy &amp; Bl√ºml , 2009 ) . These effect medical , physical , cognitive psychosocial sequela associate cancer treatment generally emerge two five year treatment end ( e.g. , Landier &amp; Bhatia , 2008 ) . The serious challenge survivor brain tumor face may cognitive dysfunction . One especially important cognitive domain executive functioning , refers essential factor problem-solving , goal-directed behavior ability maintain stable interpersonal relationship ( Lezak et al. , 2004 ) . Despite potential impact executive impairment behavioral regulation quality life , study conduct survivor PBT specifically assessment executive functioning . Another fundamental neuro-cognitive domain social cognition , refers ability understand intention beliefs others ( Frith &amp; Singer , 2008 ) . Social cognitive deficit expect impair autonomy relationship , scarce attention devote study social cognition survivor PBT study attempt compare socio-cognitive data measure health-related quality life . It noteworthy executive function socio-cognitive skill improve throughout childhood adolescence , improvement skill frequently attribute maturation brain , especially prefrontal cortex ( e.g. , Tamnes et al. , 2010 ) . This suggest great impact disease treatment function children/adolescents .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>First , investigator calculate prevalence cognitive socio-cognitive deficit , compare performance patient ( children/adolescents adult ) normative data available task performance healthy control match socio-demographic criterion . Second , investigator compare neuropsychological score cognitive socio-cognitive task health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) data ( composite score domain ) . Comparisons neuropsychological HRQOL score perform two population ( child / adolescent adult ) . Third , investigator compare data two age group aforementioned variable ( cognitive behavioral executive assessment , cognitive affective TOM ) . The proximity task provide valid element comparison . The investigator compare questionnaires auto-and hetero-evaluation HRQOL scale , also executive behavioral questionnaire . Finally , evaluate investigator compare HRQOL patients/relatives ' data measure potential impact disease HRQOL relatives PBT survivor potential link data .</detailed_description>
