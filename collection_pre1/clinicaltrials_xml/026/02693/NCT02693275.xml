	<detailed_description>Study Design : This study conduct 4 clinical site consist two study visit . All study participant complete least one study visit . A small cohort participant complete second visit purpose assess test retest reliability across study sample . Subjects recruit use clinic 's relevant patient population IRB approve recruitment material . Interested volunteer participate initial screening , may do telephone person conduct clinic 's research staff . Upon preliminary confirmation subject meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion , appointment schedule first study visit . At first visit , study explain detail . Adults ask provide write informed consent . Parents guardians individual age 18 year old provide write informed consent behalf minor . Individuals age 7 18 year age also provide write assent .

All subject take appropriate version ; Child ( age 6 -12.11 ) , Adolescent ( age 13 - 19.11 ) , Adult ( age 20 - 79.11 ) 15-minute Quotient® System iPad Test . At visit , cohort participant across 7 age group ask return clinic second study visit . These participant ask , consecutive order enrollment , return clinic second study visit . Study participant complete visit one require participate retest cohort group may opt return clinic visit two . Once required number participant ( 350 - 400 ) complete second study visit , portion study close enrollment subject give option return retest visit ( visit 2 ) . Retest Visit 2 occur 7 - 14 day follow study visit 1 . Subjects assess change health status current medication since time visit 1 . Subjects repeat appropriate version ( Child , Adolescent Adult ) 15-minute Quotient® System iPad Test . ● Study Enrollment : A minimum 1440 subject oversampling 11 % . Total enrollment expect approximately 1600 . ● Study Population : Visit 1 : Male female subject age 6 year age 80 year . There total 16 age band approximately 90 subject enrol age band . Optimally , 50-50-male/female-gender stratification per age category . Visit 2 : A cohort least 350 subject complete study Visit 1 ask return Visit 2 . An oversampling 11 % anticipate bringing total number subject ask return Visit 2 approximately 400 . Visit 2 include male female participant 7 age band . - Study Procedures : 1.
