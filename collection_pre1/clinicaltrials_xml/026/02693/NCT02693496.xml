	<detailed_description>Lung nodules manifest single multiple independent lung consolidation shadow form quasi-circular . These lung nodule surround normal lung tissue , cause pulmonary atelectasis . In early standard , quasi-circular shadow within 6cm find lung categorize lung nodule . However , accord current standard , lesion within 3cm identified lung nodule . With widespread use lung cancer CT screening , lung nodule identify frequently . What optimal way manage CT finding ? Should adopt surgical removal observation ? An optimal solution determine clearly define standard care easy learn . We propose method call `` three plus two '' . The 'Three ' three-step test method , 'Two ' mean two alternative solution . Three-step test method include collect medical history , non-invasive examination , invasive examination . The two alternative solution surgical removal follow-up observation . We independently develop application base smartphone platform . This platform provide novel evidence-based research method observe dynamic evolution lung nodules patient . There prior study manage CT scan finding , either China internationally .</detailed_description>
