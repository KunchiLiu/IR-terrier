	<brief_summary>The purpose research study improve understand irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) underlie cause . The investigator use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) observe difference brain people diagnose IBS compare healthy control people ulcerative colitis , disease group already characterize . By correlative comparative study , investigator hope gain knowledge IBS order keep field move right direction become one step closer discover effective treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite recent breakthrough research , irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) lack comprehensive mechanistic characterization . While symptoms gastroenterological disorder describe , overall assessment IBS lead sufficient treatment management plan . By move away over-reliance symptom-based approach shift towards mechanism-based approach , investigator knowledgeable attempt address disease . In order accomplish , investigator work different patient subgroup , specifically IBS subject , healthy control ( HCs ) , disease control group ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . This allow comparison significant genetic , social , biological , neurological finding subgroup , help investigator grasp difference present people suffer IBS . The investigator approach study couple different way characterize IBS best possible manner . Blood sample MRI brain image collect genetic neurological factor associate IBS explore . Given highly interactive nature biological system within body , investigator plan explore interaction brain immune system well brain gut . In , specific gene contribute IBS , well change brain contribute result IBS , scrutinized.Additionally , immune system 's influence brain IBS patient compare healthy control UC . All information contribute therapeutic study future investigator continue develop diagnostic tool treatment IBS patient . Conducting study necessitates use human subject research purpose . In total , investigator recruit 120 IBS subject , 70 age-matched HCs , 100 UC subject . During initial screen visit , subject complete physical examination , short psychological evaluation ( MINI+ ) , pressure &amp; heat sensitivity test , quick blood draw , set questionnaire . In total , baseline visit take roughly two hour . On second visit , subject return complete questionnaire brain scan MRI machine . The subject disclose MRI safety procedure clear , undergo 60 minute scan session certify MRI technician . Once complete , subject complete study . IBS female subject indicate would like part longitudinal study return 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month MRI procedure describe , MR-Spectroscopy additional modality . They also complete 5 minute online survey every month 9 month assess symptom . The Neuroimaging Core Center Neurobiology Stress responsible brain imaging analysis year 4-5 . Gene expression profile assay microbiome related study occur Neuroscience Genomics Core Laboratory UCLA Center Systems Biomedicine year 4-5 well .</detailed_description>
