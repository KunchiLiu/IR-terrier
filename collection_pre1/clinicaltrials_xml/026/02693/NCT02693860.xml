	<detailed_description>This open-label , single center pilot study evaluate efficacy huJ591 trigger antibody−dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) response manifest peri-tumoral inflammatory response without apoptosis prostate cancer cell patient diagnose either high intermediate-risk prostate cancer . To participate patient require meet eligibility criterion . Patients may participate clinical trial undergo therapeutic treatment . The initial screening period ( 28 day prior start treatment clinical trial ) consist visit confirm eligibility , discuss risk / benefit participate trial radical prostatectomy ( without lymph node dissection ) , obtain patient prostate biopsy sample anti−prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) expression review . An enrolled subject 's participation study entail approximately 6 7 week therapy along additional 2 week time involve recovery radical prostatectomy . Adverse event collect throughout entirety study . The total duration patient study around 9 11 week . Medical information/Survival information collect routine followup visit ( standard care ) 3 year surgery .</detailed_description>
