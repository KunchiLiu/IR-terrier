	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study PV-10 Chemoablation Neuroendocrine Tumours ( NET ) Metastatic Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , open-label study evaluate safety , tolerability , effect tumor growth symptomology ( clinical biomarkers ) follow single intralesional injection PV-10 subject neuroendocrine tumor metastatic liver . Subjects divide two cohort ( 6 subject ) , first receive intralesional PV-10 one liver lesion ( maximum dose 15 mL PV-10 ) ass safety . If safety establish , cohort two receive treatment amenable lesion ( maximum dose 15 mL PV-10 ) . Subjects lesion treat 6 week initial treatment provide precede treatment PV-10 well tolerate .</detailed_description>
