	<brief_summary>The investigator attempt increase cure rate ITP medical therapy provide maintenance therapy Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) persistent/chronic ITP patient treat induction therapy combine rituximab dexamethasone . The investigator randomly assign patient MMF versus placebo order demonstrate safety ( e.g. , infectious risk ) efficacy ( platelet count stably &gt; 50x109/L 1 year therapy ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Dexamethasone Followed Mycophenolate Mofetil Placebo Patients With Immune Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There significant number Immune Thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) patient 18 year age old relapse become refractory short response initial therapy ( usually corticosteroid ) respond . Despite variety available therapy , patient persistently low platelet count bleed complication , patient suffer side effect current treatment . Thus , still remain unmet need good treatment patient . Based investigator ' experience , expect ITP patient treat intensive induction therapy ( Dexamethasone combine rituximab , R+3D ) increase platelet count , investigator hope 6-month course Mycophenolate Mofetil help patient maintain continuous response even achieve cure ITP . The increase platelet count likely result decrease risk bleed good health-related quality life . In addition , responder potentially able stop concomitant ITP medication suffer adverse event various ITP therapy avoid undergo splenectomy . This multi-center , randomize study help physician determine best treatment option ITP patient may help establish new standard care . The knowledge gain : 1. whether R+3D placebo confirm previous data R+3D 2. whether R+3D + MMF increase cure rate ITP 3. whether R+3D + MMF increase risk serious infection The investigator believe triple therapy result high rate serious infection base past track record R+3D MMF combination stronger immunosuppressive medication cyclosporine tacrolimus . Therefore risk limit worth increase cure rate expect .</detailed_description>
