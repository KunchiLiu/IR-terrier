	<brief_title>Durvalumab Patients With HER-2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Receiving Trastuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard usual treatment type disease point receive drug call trastuzumab target HER-2 receptor . Durvalumab new type drug many type cancer . This drug antibody laboratory test show work allow immune system detect cancer reactivate immune response . This may help slow growth cancer may cause cancer cell die . Durvalumab show shrink tumour animal study people seem promise clear offer well result standard treatment alone . The use durvalumab receive standard treatment study think one way over-coming resistance standard therapy add drug activates immune system , durvalumab show , thus `` re-sensitizing '' immune function kill cancer cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically and/or cytologically confirm HER2 positive ( assess locally current ASCO/CAP criterion ) breast cancer advanced/metastatic/recurrent unresectable curative therapy exists . Patients enrol RP2D / expansion cohort must accessible disease suitable biopsy consent biopsy prior treatment end cycle 1 . Paired biopsy strongly recommend patient . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior registration ( within 35 day negative ) . All patient must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 . The criterion define measurable disease follow : Chest xray ≥ 20 mm CT scan ( slice thickness 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10 mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15 mm measure short axis Patients must ≥ 18 year age . Patients must ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Previous Therapy Must prior exposure taxane , trastuzumab pertuzumab* preferably also prior exposure TDM1 . Taxane pertuzumab may adjuvant neoadjuvant setting . Must eligible trastuzumab treatment per provincial / formulary guideline ( i.e . patient two prior line either trastuzumab lapatinib ) . Must receive least one HER2 base therapy palliative setting . * Note : exception requirement prior pertuzumab may give . Consult CCTG . Cytotoxic Chemotherapy : There limit number prior regimen . Other Systemic Therapy : There limit number prior regimen ; however , patient may prior immune therapy . Patients must recover reversible toxicity relate prior chemotherapy systemic therapy adequate washout follow : Longest one follow : Two week , 5 halflives investigational agent , Standard cycle length standard therapy . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse last dose radiation date registration . Exceptions may make lowdose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation NCIC CTG . Concurrent radiotherapy permit . Surgery : Previous surgery permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse major surgery date registration , wound heal occur . Laboratory Requirements ( must do within 7 day prior registration ) Hematology Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L Chemistry Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) * AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN &amp; ≤ 5.0 x ULN patient liver metastasis Serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 x ULN : Creatinine clearance** ≥ 40 mL/min Female patient childbearing potential sexually active nonsterilized male partner must use least one highly effective method contraception study 90 day last dose durvalumab consult product monograph trastuzumab . Male partner female subject nonsterilized male patient sexually active female partner childbearing potential must use male condom plus spermicide study 90 day last dose durvalumab consult product monograph trastuzumab . Female partner male subject must use highly effective method contraception throughout period . Cessation birth control point discuss responsible physician . Subjects donate blood participate study , least 90 day follow last infusion durvalumab , time specify prescribe information trastuzumab , whichever occur long . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior registration trial prior test consider study specific document willingness participate . Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . In accordance CCTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient registration . Patients history malignancy require concurrent anticancer therapy . Patients brain metastasis eligible provide treat , stable ( CT scan prior enrolment mandatory patient know brain metastasis ) patient stable decrease dose steroid ( equivalent prednisone 10mg ) . Active prior document autoimmune inflammatory disorder ( include inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . colitis Crohn 's disease ) , diverticulitis exception diverticulosis , celiac disease serious gastrointestinal chronic condition associate diarrhea ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sarcoidosis syndrome , Wegener syndrome ( granulomatosis polyangiitis ) , rheumatoid arthritis , hypophysitis , uveitis , etc. , within past 2 year prior start treatment . The following exception criterion : patient vitiligo alopecia , Graves ' disease , hypothyroidism ( e.g . follow Hashimoto syndrome ) stable hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment ( within past 2 year ) . History primary immunodeficiency , history organ transplant require therapeutic immunosuppression use immunosuppressive agent within 28 day registration prior history severe ( grade 3 4 ) immune mediate toxicity immune therapy ( NOTE : Intranasal/inhaled corticosteroid systemic steroid exceed 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent dose alternative corticosteroid permissible . ) Live attenuate vaccination administer within 30 day prior registration within 30 day receive durvalumab . Any previous treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , immune base therapy include durvalumab . History hypersensitivity durvalumab trastuzumab excipient . Mean QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) ≥ 470 m calculate 3 ECGs use Fredericia 's Correction . Patients experience untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction ( uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within previous year cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require medication , history 2nd 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defect ) . Patients LVEF ≥ 50 % . Concurrent treatment investigational drug anticancer therapy . Patients serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol . This include limited : History significant neurologic psychiatric disorder would impair ability obtain consent limit compliance study compliance . Active infection ( include patient know active hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) tuberculosis infection require systemic therapy ) . active peptic ulcer disease gastritis Pregnant lactate woman . Women childbearing potential must pregnancy test ( urine serum ) proven negative within 14 day prior registration . If test positive , pregnancy testing may include ultrasound ruleout pregnancy falsepositive suspect . For example , betahuman chorionic gonadotropin high partner vasectomize , may associate tumour production hCG , see cancer . Patient consider eligible ultrasound negative pregnancy .</criteria>
