	<brief_summary>The role oxidative stress disease pathology increasingly recognize . At present , development biomarkers state infancy availability clinically validate assay lack . This study well determine normal value specific biomarkers oxidative stress . It also investigate normal value taurine , natural occur oxidative stress protectant . A primary specific application data evaluation oxidative stress , level natural protectant taurine , associate inflammation context cystathionine Î²-synthase ( ClinicalTrials.gov study : Oxidative Stress Markers Inherited Homocystinuria Impact Taurine ) .</brief_summary>
