	<criteria>1 . Male female , least 18 year age , inclusive . 2 . Subject symptomatic MPE require intervention . For effusion define malignant , least one follow must true : 1 . There histocytological confirmation pleural malignancy 2 . The effusion exudate ( per Light 's criterion ) context histocytologically proven malignancy elsewhere , clear cause fluid identify . 3 . Subject history least 1 ipsilateral pleural effusion cause dyspnea respond thoracentesis lung expand dyspnea improve . 4 . Subject willing able provide write informed consent . 5 . Subject willing able meet study requirement , include followup visit receive studyrelated telephone call . 6 . Subject sufficient pleural fluid allow safe insertion IPC . 7 . Subject negative pregnancy test appropriate . 8 . Subject caregiver able perform home drainage pleural effusion ( caregiver friend , family member pay healthcare professional applies US sit ; UK subject drainage manage homecare nurse ) . 1 . Subject significant trap lung , proximal bronchial obstruction likely lead trap lung . For subject eligible study , 2 separate study center clinician must agree significant trap lung CXR use visual estimation ( reference guide ) . The CXR use make decision must perform ≤30 day precede consent form sign , must perform preferably day , 7 calendar day pleural drainage . Significant trap lung deem present 1 follow criterion meet : 1 . A CXR show hydropneumothorax . 2 . A CXR show ≥20 % affect hemithorax free expect lung parenchymal marking suggestion pleural fluid . 3 . A CXR show ≥20 % affected hemithorax occupy pleural fluid AFTER pleural aspiration result symptom suggestive trap lung ( e.g. , chest pain cough ) . 2 . Subject Karnofsky score &lt; 50 , World Health Organization ( WHO ) / Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≥3 . Subjects performance status 3 may consider study removal fluid would likely improve performance score 1 . 3 . Subject pregnant , plan become pregnant , lactate . 4 . Subject history empyema . 5 . Subject history chylothorax . 6 . Subject uncorrected coagulopathy . 7 . Subject hypersensitivity new exist pleural catheter 's component . 8 . Subject evidence , opinion Investigator , either ongoing systemic pleural infection . 9 . Subject lobectomy pneumonectomy side effusion . 10 . Subject undergone previous attempt ipsilateral pleurodesis fail . 11 . Subject previously diagnose serious immunodeficiency disorder . 12 . Subject bilateral pleural effusion , least moderate size ( great onethird hemithorax CXR ) . 13 . Subject evidence fluid loculation attempt pleurodesis likely futile . 14 . Subject mediastinal shift ≥2 cm toward side effusion . 15 . Subject receive concurrent intrapleural chemotherapy radiation therapy ipsilateral chest . 16 . Subject clinical condition , diagnosis , social circumstance , opinion Investigator , would mean participation study would contraindicate . 17 . Subject access telephone . 18 . Subject document blood value ( complete blood count [ CBC ] , coagulation test , urea electrolyte , liver function test [ LFTs ] ) within last 10 day . 19 .
