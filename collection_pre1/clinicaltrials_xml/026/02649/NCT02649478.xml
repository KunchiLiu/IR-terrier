	<brief_title>Clinical Endpoint Bioequivalence Study Fluticasone Propionate Salmeterol Xinafoate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate clinical bioequivalence generic fluticasone propionate 100 µg salmeterol xinafoate 50 µg inhalation powder ( test ) Advair Diskus ( `` Advair '' ) 100/50 ( reference ) treatment asthma . The secondary objective study : - To demonstrate statistical superiority generic fluticasone propionate 100 µg salmeterol xinafoate 50 µg inhalation powder placebo . - To demonstrate statistical superiority Advair 100/50 placebo . - To investigate safety tolerability fluticasone propionate 100 µg salmeterol xinafoate 50 µg inhalation powder compare Advair 100/50 target population .</detailed_description>
