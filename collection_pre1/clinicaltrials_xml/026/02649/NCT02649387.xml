	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Treating Minimal Residual Disease Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia After Front-Line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine rate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) -negative response ( blood bone marrow ) time treatment ibrutinib maintenance . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Median time achieve MRD- ( negative ) status ( blood bone marrow ) initiation ibrutinib maintenance treatment . II . Toxicity profile ibrutinib maintenance therapy frontline induction . III . Durability MRD- state ( determined time first documentation MRD- first documentation MRD+ ( positive ) ( last date show MRD- censor ) . IV . Determine number patient improve remission category ( i.e. , upgrade clinical response achieve induction partial response [ PR ] complete response [ CR ] ) initiate maintenance therapy . V. Time requirement next therapy patient achieve confirm MRD- vs. remain MRD+ disease 48 week ( end 12 cycle ) . VI . Progression free survival ( determined International Workshop Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia [ IWCLL ] criterion ) among patient achieve confirm MRD- vs. remain MRD+ disease 48 week ( end 12 cycle ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct correlative study understand mechanism antitumor activity ibrutinib eradication MRD . II . Determine impact ibrutinib depression anxiety symptom well understand toxicity profile ibrutinib maintenance . III . Determine impact social support lack thereof mood symptom chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) patient receive maintenance treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 weeks* 36 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Note : *The last course may last 56 day accommodate study drug discontinuation visit . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
