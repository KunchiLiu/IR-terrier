	<brief_summary>Given up-regulation Wnt pathway identify significant role carcinogenesis advance head neck squamous cell carcinoma , investigator believe inhibition Porcupine via WNT974 result tumor control hence improvement disease free overall survival patient tolerable toxicity profile . As suggested pre-clinical model , patient tumor harbor Notch receptor ( four ) loss function mutation may great response rate treatment WNT974 . The investigator aim address question administration single agent WNT974 follow response radiologically along close clinical follow monitor toxicity .</brief_summary>

Exceptions exclusion criterion include follow : malignancy treat curatively , recur within 3 year prior study entry ; completely resect basal cell squamous cell skin cancer ; completely resect carcinoma situ type Patients receive anticancer therapy prior first dose WNT974 within follow time frame : Biological therapy prolong halflife ( e.g. , monoclonal antibody ) within 4 week , Cytotoxic agent associate delayed hematologic recovery ( e.g. , nitrosourea mitomycinC ) within 6 week , Other systemic anticancer agent within 3 week , Radiotherapy within 2 week Patients currently receive treatment medication meet one follow criterion discontinue least one week prior start treatment WNT974 : Strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 , CYP3A4/5 substrates narrow therapeutic index , know prolong QT interval also CYP3A4/5 substrate . Refer Appendix 1 guidance concomitant medication . Patients undergone major surgery within 2 week prior start study drug adequately recover previous surgery Active hepatitis B C infection Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unless use highly effective method contraception dose 30 day study treatment . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence , male female sterilization , combination two following : Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception , placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) , barrier method contraception . Postmenopausal woman allow participate study . Sexually active male must use condom intercourse take drug 90 day stop treatment father child period . Other severe , acute , chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation Patients reside prison .</criteria>
