	<brief_title>LY2606368 Combination With Cytarabine Fludarabine Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( HRMDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level LY2606368 base join study . Up 5 dose level LY2606368 test . The first group enrol receive low dose level . If intolerable serious side effect see group , next group receive high dose level . This continue high tolerable dose level LY2606368 find . Once high tolerable dose LY2606368 find , 20 participant enrol receive drug dose find well tolerate earlier part study order study safety effectiveness drug . All participant also receive dose level fludarabine cytarabine . Study Drug Administration : Treatment study give 2 phase : Induction Consolidation . Each cycle 28 day . Induction Phase : You receive 1 cycle treatment Induction phase . You may admit inpatient leukemia service receive study drug . On Days 1-4 , receive cytarabine vein non-stop fludarabine vein 2 hour . If age 65 , cytarabine fludarabine give Days 1-3 . You receive LY2606368 vein 2 hour 5 day , depend dose level LY2606368 assign . If disease respond Cycle 1 , may allow receive additional Induction cycle , also call Cycle 1 . If respond well study drug Induction , move Consolidation therapy . Consolidation Therapy : You may continue Consolidation therapy 3 additional cycle . During Days 1-3 cycle , receive cytarabine vein non-stop fludarabine vein 2 hour . On Days 1-2 , receive LY2606368 vein 2 hour . Study Visits : Induction Phase : On Day 1 ( 7 day ) Cycle 1 , physical exam . On Days 1 , 3 , 5 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PD test . On Days 1 4 5 Cycle 1 , EKG . Every week , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test On Day 28 ( Â± 3 day ) Cycle 1 , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy check status disease . Any time doctor think need , additional blood test . Consolidation Therapy : On Day 1 cycle , physical exam . Every week , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test Any time doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration/biopsy . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug 5 cycle ( 2 cycle Induction , 3 cycle Consolidation ) . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 30 day ( +/- 5 day ) last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You EKG either ECHO MUGA scan check heart function . - You bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy check status disease . Follow-Up Visits : If disease appear get good end-of-treatment visit , every 2-3 month 2 year : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You physical exam . These test perform local doctor . This investigational study . LY2606368 FDA approve commercially available . It use research purpose . Cytarabine fludarabine FDA approve commercially available treat certain type leukemia . Their use study combination LY2606368 consider investigational . Up 40 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
