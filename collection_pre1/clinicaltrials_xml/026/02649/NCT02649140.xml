	<brief_summary>Purpose : The aim present study investigate effect vinegar consumption 24-hour urinary risk factor associate calcium oxalate urinary stone formation blood biochemical parameter . Methods : The investigator recruit 50 healthy young student volunteer study . By simple random sampling technique , volunteer allocate two group ( group 1 , control group ; group 2 , vinegar group ) .Each participant vinegar group drink 15ml vinegar ( Ninghuafu , Sanxi , China ) noon even respectively period four weeks.The end point study comparison outcomes 24-hour urine blood biochemical parameter different group point-in-time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Vinegar Consumption 24-hour Urinary Risk Factors Associated With Stone Formation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The write history vinegar use China 5,000 year , use health care product since ancient time . In addition main component acetic acid , also contain acid , ester , polyphenols active substances.Previous study report effect vinegar , delay gastric emptying , relieve fatigue , regulate blood glucose lipid metabolism , antioxidant , reduce blood pressure . The China national epidemiological study urolithiasis conduct May 2013 July 2014 indicate vinegar may protective formation urolithiasis ( publish ) . Animal experiment show vinegar could inhibit oxalate calcium crystal formation rat kidney ( publish ) . Consequently , perform randomize control trial investigate effect vinegar consumption 24-hour urinary risk factor associate calcium oxalate urinary stone formation blood biochemical parameter . Methods : Study design participant : We recruit 50 healthy young student volunteer study . The inclusion criterion male age 18-35 year , normal renal function , without urolithiasis congenital urinary tract abnormality . The exclusion criterion include hematuria , urinary tract infection history kidney urinary diversion . We exclude male old 35 year usually work easy collect 24-hour sample . The reason exclude female trail last four week woman 's menstrual cycle could affect 24-hour urine collection . Randomisation : Trained research clinician enroll volunteer university nearby hospital . Volunteers allocate 1:1 ratio control group ( group 1 ) vinegar group ( group 2 ) simple random sampling technique , conduct clinical trial office urology department hospital Guangzhou , China . Procedures : Each participant vinegar group drink 15ml vinegar ( Ninghuafu , Sanxi , China ) dinner noon even respectively period four week , participant control group need intervention.All participant drink vinegar surveillance research clinician . Data collection : Baseline data collect randomization hospital . The baseline data protocol include urinary ultrasonography , spot urine examines , 24-hour urine analysis blood chemical examines . The parameter 24-hour urine analysis include Ph , volume , creatinine , oxalate , citrate , phosphate , uric acid , calcium , magnesium , sodium chloride . The standard blood analysis protocol include routine haematology , fast serum glucose , creatinine , urea , uric acid , high-density lipoprotein , low-density lipoprotein , triglyceride , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , total protein ( TP ) , albumin , glutamyltransferase ( GGT ) , serum total bile acid , cholesterol , sodium , potassium , calcium chloride ion . Another tube blood sample freeze -80 degree refrigerator analysis oxidation blood protein product ( AOPP ) , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , glutathion peroxidase ( GSH-PX ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) catalase activity ( CAT ) . Follow-up data include 24-hour urine analysis 7th , 14th , 21th 28th day period blood biochemical examines 29th day . The protocol 24-hour urine blood chemical examines baseline data . And participant ask make record meal seven days.The ANOVA repeat measure use perform data analysis .</detailed_description>
