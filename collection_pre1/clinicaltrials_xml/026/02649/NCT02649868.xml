	<brief_summary>Background : Liver cancer begin cell liver . It treat chemotherapy , radiation , even liver transplant . A less invasive treatment may able help people liver cancer . It call percutaneous transarterial embolization ( TAE ) . For TAE , material inject blood vessel block blood flow feed tumor . Researchers want test new material TAE may shrink tumor see x-ray CT image . The embolization may sometimes combine thermal ablation , cook tumor needle deliver heat electricity microwave . Objective : To test embolization material call LC LUMI bead . To see block blood vessel provide blood cancerous tumor see beads look x-ray CT image . Eligibility : Adults 18 85 year old diagnose liver cancer Design : Participants routine blood test , physical exam , x-rays . Participants screen blood test , physical exam , medical history . They compute tomography ( CT ) scan abdomen pelvis . This include contrast drink contrast ( dye ) inject vein . Participants admit clinic . They repeat screen test . Participants may test . These may include x-ray , scan , ultrasound . Participants evaluate general anesthesia . They get counseling procedure . Participants get anesthesia . The LC LUMI bead inject blood vessel . The bead contain iodine , make visible x-ray CT scan machine . Participants follow-up visit 12 month . They CT scan and/or radiologic test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LC Bead LUMI Radio-Opaque Embolic Beads Detect Characterize Vascularity Hepatic Tumors During Treatment With Transarterial Embolization ( TAE ) Alone Combined With Thermal Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) 3rd common cause cancer globally increase incidence worldwide . - Management hepatic malignancy primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) metastatic disease involve multidisciplinary approach surgery chemotherapy case HCC , transplant , anti-VEGF sorafenib , local regional image guide therapy . - Thermal ablation ( RFA MWA ) transarterial embolization ( TAE ) minimally invasive image guide local regional therapy extensively study decade , recently less extent study together combination therapy . - LC Bead LUMI , radiopaque embolic bead product ( company code BTG 13-002 ) , imageable spherical embolic product visualise X-ray base imaging ( e.g. , fluoroscopy CT ) . - The bead non-resorbable microspheres calibrate size range occlude artery purpose block blood flow target tissue . - LC Bead LUMI intend use embolization hypervascular tumor arteriovenous malformation ( AVMs ) . Objectives : -To determine image characteristic radiopaque bead treatment hepatic tumor use bead embolization . Eligibility : - At least great equal 18 year age - Patients pathologically proven hepatic-dominant neoplasm might otherwise candidate standard clinical TAE bead - ECOG performance status less equal 2 - Patients must normal organ marrow function per laboratory parameter - Patients minor allergy iodine also exclude , non-iodine-related exclusion criterion standard care exclusion criterion TAE Design : - Number Participants : 30 - Recruitment Time Frame : 2 year - Type Study : Feasibility study - This pilot study assess characteristic radio-opaque bland bead TAE treatment hepatic malignancy . Patients may also receive thermal ablation treatment conjunction TAE clinically indicate , although comparison bead treatment without thermal ablation part study aim . - Imaging evaluation therapy may perform regular interval follow completion treatment , govern standard conventional image regimen post treatment . - The choice combination imaging ( CT , Cone beam CT , fluoroscopy ) image , make clinical care team patient , base upon multidisciplinary recommendation NIH Clinical Center customary use standard care , purely clinical decision ( research-related ) . - The participant diagnose hepatic malignancy , eligible undergo transarterial embolization thermal ablation general anesthesia . The LC LUMI bead use transarterial embolization procedure . - Study period 12 month time initial treatment . - Patients evaluate multidisciplinary GI medical oncology clinic 30 patient enrol 1 year accrue 20 evaluable patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients pathologically proven hepaticdominant neoplasm might otherwise candidate standard clinical TAE . Extent hepatic metastasis &lt; 50 % total hepatic volume . At least great equal to18 year age : Because exceed rare someone age 18 develop hepatocellular carcinoma , exclude patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . ECOG performance status 02 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : No contraindication receive iodine product . Main Portal Vein Occlusion contraindication chemoembolization Prior selective internal radiation therapy ( SIRT ) 90Y one treatment per lobe single whole liver treatment . Patients take immunosuppressive drug unable come ongoing chronic anticoagulation eligible . Patients active bacterial infection systemic manifestation ( malaise , fever , leukocytosis ) eligible completion appropriate therapy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman nurse mother exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect require multiple imaging associate radiation dos , anesthesia risk thermal ablation fetus .</criteria>
