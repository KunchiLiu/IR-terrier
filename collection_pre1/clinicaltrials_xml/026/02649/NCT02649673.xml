	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , non-randomized dose-escalation study oral LCL161 administer combination oral topotecan . Topotecan US FDA approve treat metastatic ovarian cancer , stage IV-B cervical cancer , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . LCL161 , investigational product , oral small-molecule antagonist inhibitor apoptosis protein ( IAPs ) . Preclinical data suggest IAP antagonist work synergy anti-cancer agent . This study design evaluate combination two agent patient SCLC ovarian cancer treatment topotecan would appropriate . The study conduct 2 part . In dose-escalation part study , patient relapsed/refractory SCLC gynecologic malignancy eligible enrollment determine optimal dose drug combination administer . Patients continue treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The dose-expansion part study limit patient ovarian cancer relapsed/refractory SCLC ( 2 cohort 12 patient ) assess safety preliminary anti-tumor activity . Up 52 patient plan enrollment 3 center U.S .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>KEY POINTS : Dose Escalation Portion : Must histological diagnosis relapsed/refractory SCLC gynecological malignancy topotecan would indicate . Dose Expansion Portion : Must histological diagnosis relapsed/refractory SCLC ovarian cancer topotecan would indicate . Patients ovarian cancer must evidence recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer must previously receive platinum taxanebased chemotherapy regimen . Patients SCLC must receive platinumbased chemotherapy . Measurable nonmeasurable ( evaluable ) disease Adequate organ function Life expectancy â‰¥ 12 week . Patients brain metastasis may enrol radiation and/or surgery complete serial evaluation compute tomography magnetic resonance image 2 month demonstrate stable disease . More 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens give metastatic setting .
