	<brief_title>The Improvement Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency ( LSCD ) Unilateral Stem Cell Damage Amniotic Membrane Extract Eye Drop ( AMEED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cornea eye anterior portion refractive power transparent essential normal vision . The damage cornea surface reduce vision lead blindness , ultimately . Corneal epithelial time , limbal stem cell ( LSC ) involve corneal injury . Limbal stem cell ( LSC ) necessary repair reconstruction corneal reduction cell occur various cause include congenital cause , eye inflammatory disease burn . For cornea stem cell damage limbal stem cell deficiency ( LSCD ) , cornea becomes conjunctivalization . LSCD may involve one eye ( unilateral ) two eye ( bilateral ) . Due autologous transplantation problem patient unilateral LSCD recent success resolve problem , seem transplantation culture corneal stem cell amniotic membrane way treatment unilateral LSCD . It call ex vivo . Amniotic membrane modulate corneal epithelium heal promote re-epithelialization migration limbal stem cell suppress stromal inflammation , angiogenesis scarring . It well accept amniotic membrane transplantation ( AMT ) temporary patch normally dissolve within 2 week . Consequent reapplication membrane difficult patient . On hand , ex vivo , corneal tissue healthy eye must transport laboratory cell culture AM require equipment . There , also , risk cell infection transmission important issue . However , infected cell , re-biopsy healthy eye require uncomfortable difficult patient . Other study report amniotic membrane extract ( AME ) characteristic feature . We previously report effective potential AMEED limbal stem cell proliferation vitro also rabbit corneal epithelium heal vivo . This study prospective clinical trial use Amniotic Membrane Extract Eye Drop ( AMEED ) vivo culture limbal stem cell treatment unilateral corneal stem cell damage .</detailed_description>
