	<brief_summary>Essential tremor incurable , degenerative brain disorder result increasingly debilitate tremor , afflict estimate 7 million people US . In one study , 25 % essential tremor patient force change job take early retirement tremor . Essential tremor directly link progressive functional impairment , social embarrassment , even depression . The tremor associate essential tremor typically slow , involve hand ( sometimes head voice ) , worsen intentional movement , insidiously progressive many year . Deep brain stimulation emerge highly effective treatment intractable , debilitate essential tremor . However , since intention tremor essential tremor typically intermittent , commonly absent rest , currently available continuous deep brain stimulation may deliver unnecessary current brain increase undesirable side effect slur speech walk difficulty , hasten depletion device battery , necessitate frequent surgical procedure replace spend pulse generator . The overall objective early feasibility study provide preliminary data safety efficacy `` closed-loop '' deep brain stimulation intention tremor use novel deep brain stimulation device capable continuously sense brain activity deliver therapeutic stimulation necessary suppress tremor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Responsive Deep Brain Stimulator Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate brain signal related intention tremor essential tremor order deliver deep brain stimulation patient show symptom . By deliver stimulation need , investigator hypothesize treatment effective , cause few adverse side effect increase battery time device ( reduce number battery replacement surgery ) . Participation study require extensive pre-surgical screening determine eligibility deep brain stimulation surgery , deep brain stimulation surgical procedure , regular follow-up . Subjects see monthly post surgery 6 month . After 6 month , data assess closed-loop deep brain stimulation may offer stimulation set . If , stimulator setting change chronic responsive . If , subject continue receive chronic deep brain stimulation stimulation . Subsequent visit schedule every 6 month total 24 month study participation ( also month 9 ) . At end initial 24-month study period , subject choice 1 ) continue active stimulation current setting , 2 ) continue stimulation search new setting , 3 ) discontinue stimulation ( turn device ) , 4 ) device remove . If subject continue receive active stimulation , follow investigator see yearly interval .</detailed_description>
