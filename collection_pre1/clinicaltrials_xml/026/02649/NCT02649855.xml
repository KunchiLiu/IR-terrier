	<brief_summary>Background : Metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer cancer spread beyond prostate area . It control lower amount testosterone body . This call androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . The vaccine PROSTVAC might help immune system kill cancer cell . Researchers want add PROSTVAC docetaxel chemotherapy ADT . They think may work good prostate cancer ADT alone . Objective : To test add PROSTVAC docetaxel ADT work well prostate cancer ADT alone . Eligibility : Men age 18 year metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer Design : Participants screen : Physical exam Medical history Blood test Possible CT , MRI , bone scan : Participants lie machine . The machine take picture body . Electrocardiogram : Soft electrode stuck skin record heart signal . Participants 2 optional tumor biopsy study . Participants join 1 2 group . Both group get : ADT Docetaxel vein Steroids mouth vein docetaxel infusion PROSTVAC injection Both group first ADT . One 4 month , : Group A : Docetaxel every 3 week 6 cycle PROSTVAC 3 week last infusion Booster injection 2 week later every 3 week , 6 booster total Group B : PROSTVAC Booster 2 week later Docetaxel hour later Docetaxel booster every 3 week 6 cycle Participants visit 4-5 week last treatment . They visit every 12 week . Participants follow 15 year . This include physical exam every year 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel PROSTVAC Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - A phase III trial demonstrate combine docetaxel androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) significantly improve survival ( 57.6 vs 44.0 month ( HR=0.56 , ( 0.44-0.70 ) , p &lt; 0.0001 ) men metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer ( mCSPC ) . - PROSTVAC ( developed National Cancer Institute [ NCI ] license Bavarian Nordic Immunotherapeutics , Mountain View , CA ) therapeutic cancer vaccine prostate cancer . Early study demonstrate immunologic efficacy suggest clinical benefit . A phase III trial complete accrual . - Preclinical clinical study support potential synergy combination docetaxel PROSTVAC . The potential combine docetaxel vaccine mCSPC could improve upon survival advantage previously see . Objectives : Primary -To determine PROSTVAC combine docetaxel able induce great antigen spreading ( i.e . broad immune response ) great associate response score compare docetaxel alone 19 week . Key Eligibility Criteria : - Must castrate sensitive prostate cancer ( rise PSA testosterone 100 ) within 134 day start ADT ( Arm A B ) within 28 day start ADT ( Arm C ) - Histopathological confirmation prostate cancer - Patients must metastatic disease - Patients must performance status 0 2 accord ECOG criterion - Patients must adequate bone marrow , hepatic , renal function Design - This randomized trial ADT follow simultaneous docetaxel 75 mg/m ( 2 ) q3 week x 6 cycle + PROSTVAC q3 week x 6 cycle versus ADT follow sequential docetaxel 75 mg/m ( 2 ) q3 week x 6 cycle follow PROSTVAC q3 week x 6 cycle men newly diagnose mCSPC . - Patients start ADT ADT le 28 day assign treatment PROSTVAC 6 injection follow docetaxel 75 mg/m2 q3 week x 6 cycle .</detailed_description>
