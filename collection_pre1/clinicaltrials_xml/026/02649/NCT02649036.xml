	<brief_summary>Background : Inequality access healthcare challenge internationally . Despite medical emergency call consider access point pre-hospital emergency care hospital admission emergency situation , data inequality access healthcare emergency call report international literature . Study aim : The aim study two-fold : 1. evaluate association socio-economic characteristic citizen first-time emergency call Capital Region Denmark 2. evaluate association socio-economic characteristic citizen emergency call priority level response provide emergency medical dispatch center Capital Region Denmark . Method : Observational register base study adult citizen Capital Region Denmark . Educational level , household income employment use socioeconomic indicator . The unique civil registration number use link data Emergency Medical Dispatch Center data Civil Registration System , Danish register personal labor market affiliation , Danish Populations Education Register , Danish Income Statistics Registry national patient registry . Logistic regression model use association socio economic indicator first time emergency call association socioeconomic indicator priority level response provide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : In prehospital emergency medicine , emergency medical dispatcher play essential role gatekeeper emergency care emergency medical service possibly hospital admission . Dispatching task handle emergency call term appropriate triage , delivery pre-arrival instruction management resource citizens call help . Research within out-of-hospital cardiac arrest show medical dispatcher contribute increase survival , cardiac arrest identify emergency call , telephone assist cardiopulmonary resuscitation initiate . Optimal performance link chain survival dependent good performance healthcare professional prehospital setting , also person initiate resuscitation call help . This true OHCA also life-threatening situation outcome may affect interaction person call help medical dispatcher respond call providing advice adequate response emergency medical service . Research area , however , early stage . Inequality access healthcare challenge internationally . Despite medical emergency call consider access point pre-hospital emergency care hospital admission emergency situation , data inequality access healthcare emergency call report international literature . Study Objective : The aim study two-fold : 1 . To evaluate association socio-economic characteristic citizen first-time emergency call Capital Region Denmark 2 . To evaluate association socio-economic characteristic citizen emergency call emergency response provide emergency medical dispatch center Capital Region Denmark . Hypotheses : 1 . Low socioeconomic position ( measured educational level , employment , household income social indicator ) associate high incidence emergency call , compare high socioeconomic position . 2 . Within common medical contact cause ( chest pain , intoxication , breathe difficulty , abdominal pain/back pain , alter level consciousness , seizures unconscious/lifeless adult ) , low socioeconomic position ( measured educational level , employment , household income indicator ) associate low level emergency response , compare high socioeconomic position . Study design : The study investigation population Capital Region Denmark perform combine data Emergency Medical Services Danish central registry two-year period ( December 2011-November 2013 ) . Setting : The study base data Capital Region Denmark population 1.8 million . In Denmark , healthcare service cover income tax . In case emergency , single emergency phone number ( 1-1-2 ) call center identifies need police , fire medical assistance . In case medical problem , caller re-directed Emergency Medical Dispatch Center medical dispatcher answer , process respond call activate appropriate Emergency Medical Services . The medical dispatcher specially trained nurse paramedic experience within emergency medicine . Their decision-making process support criteria-based , nationwide Emergency Medical Dispatch System ( Danish Index Emergency Care ) , validate tool manage emergency call urgent case emergency . Analysis , study part 1 : • Logistic regression model use emergency call outcome variable ( yes/no ) socioeconomic indicator explanatory variable , calculate odds ratio probability first-time emergency call socioeconomic indicator . The analysis perform unadjusted adjusted age , gender , civil status , country origin , comorbidity . Analysis , study part 2 : - Ordinal logistic regression model use emergency response outcome variable ( four level ) socioeconomic indicator explanatory variable calculate probability emergency response . The analysis perform unadjusted adjusted age , gender , civil status , country origin comorbidity . - The analysis primarily perform complete case analysis secondarily weight analysis accord proportion miss personal identification number within response type original dataset .</detailed_description>
