	<brief_title>Detection Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSA ) Pregnant Women Assessment Impact OSA Pregnancy Course</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During pregnancy , obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) prevalence estimate 5 % 15 % associate maternal fetal comorbidities preeclampsia , neonatal intensive care admission , fetal growth retardation , preterm birth even grow , literature still relatively poor topic . To date , systematic screening OSA perform at-risk pregnant woman ( obesity , hypertension , diabetes , fetal growth retardation , suggestive symptom ) , probably mainly polysomnography complexity accessibility . As non pregnant woman , OSA must treat adequately pregnancy . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) reference treatment severe OSA . This device , blow air pressure upper airway , via nasal oro-nasal mask , able alleviate upper airway collapse responsible occurrence obstructive sleep apnea . It proven offer survival benefit patient severe disease improve sleep quality , cardiovascular variable health-related quality life . CPAP show improve fetal well-being pre-eclampsia . Oral appliance alternative mild moderate disease patient tolerate CPAP . Positional counsel sufficient case mild moderate positional OSA . Associated behavioural strategy ( diet exercise ) always recommend case excessive weight . Surgical treatment dedicate patient specific anatomic problem perform pregancy . Aim study : The primary aim study screen OSA risk pregnant woman Watch-PAT 200 , simplify sleep study tool use ambulatory mode able detect accurately OSA suspect patient . As secondary aim , observe impact OSA composite endpoint assess materno-fetal wellbeing .</detailed_description>
