	<brief_summary>Scientists develop instrument work like `` electronic nose '' . It able `` sniff '' smell separate different smell electronic `` signature '' . Studies use electronic nose strongly suggest smell sample take human ( e.g . urine/ stool/ sweat/ tear ) identify different electronic smell signature people different disease future might new easy way diagnose serious condition earlier stage . In small study , successfully show use electronic nose sniff stool sample seem identify people radiotherapy - go get serious bowel side effect radiotherapy . If finding correct , important would allow cancer doctor option change way give radiotherapy know person high risk serious side effect treatment start treatment side effect much early stage . In study investigator want confirm large study whether previous finding correct , see whether similar result obtain sniff urine rather stool ( would much easier everyone ) identify exactly part complicate `` smell '' signature different people get side effect . This may lead investigator able identify people make specific smell something change smell treatment start . The likeliest cause production smell predisposes side effect specific group germs live bowel . If germ identify , many possible way change germ population advance radiotherapy . Enormous improvement make treat cancer recent year lead hugely improve survival , however , treatment infrequently lead side effect . Of possible long term physical side effect cancer treatment , gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms common great impact daily activity . It become increasingly clear development side effect bowel relate dose way radiotherapy deliver .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Electronic Nose Predict Gastrointestinal Consequences Pelvic Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There enormous improvement outcomes patient diagnosed cancer recent year . Patients survive long number survivor cancer therapy increase 3 % annually UK 11 % USA.It estimate 4 million cancer survivor UK 2030.Patients cancer treatment many unmet need often cause therapy give cure control cancer . Of possible chronic physical side effect cancer treatment , gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms common great impact daily activity also frequently carry serious financial , psychological social implication . During treatment cancer , GI symptoms common cause poorly research despite impact patient ' quality life fact occur often require dose reduction cessation chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy potential impact outcome . In addition , GI side effect may settle anti-cancer treatment stop . In patient receive radiotherapy tumor pelvis , severe acute reaction predispose bad long term side effect . At least 17,000 British patient treat annually radiotherapy pelvic cancer . Up 80 % patient leave chronic alteration GI function , 50 % state affect daily activity 30 % change function moderate severe effect . While progress make define optimal management chronic change bowel function cancer treatment UK multi-professional guidance aid clinician publish would extremely valuable able predict advance might go develop serious problem result radiotherapy opportunity provide pre-treatment counseling , potentially modify cancer treatment introduce toxicity modifying therapy earliest opportunity . It widely believe technical advance delivery radiotherapy abolish GI problem however , recent compelling data demonstrate 30 % patient treat `` perfect '' radiotherapy - meeting every described constraint still develop significant un-predicted problem . While mechanisms gastrointestinal symptom occur cancer treatment start understood personal parameter change risk profile individual identify ( body mass index , concomitant chemotherapy , use statin ACE inhibitor , presence diabetes mellitus , hypertension , connective tissue disorder HIV infection ) reason patient remain symptom free whilst others experience severe side effect remain researched . It become clear development GI toxicity solely relate dose way radiotherapy deliver , phenomenon independent radiation call 'the consequential effect ' second reason people get chronic side effect radiotherapy . An important driver 'consequential effect ' increasingly believe microbiota , vast number bacteria live gut . The gastrointestinal microbiota complex ecosystem 1,000 bacterial specie one individual . The specie vary greatly individual within individual , flora composition remain stable majority specie time . The diversity microbiota high healthy people low people GI side effect pelvic radiotherapy , process closely parallels finding people much intensively researched inflammatory condition bowel . Normal gut flora produce gas metabolite ( Volatile Organic Compounds VOCs ) . The gold standard analyze volatile organic compound gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( GCMS ) . GCMS analyse gas identify chemical component gas . However , expensive require specialized laboratory process sample hence viable option day day clinical practice . Two alternative technique apply analyse VOCs : electronic sensing ( e-nose ) High Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry ( FAIMS ) . Electronic sense technique apply via instrument ( electronic nose ) attempt replicate biological olfactory system , investigate sample whole , instead identify specific chemical within complex sample . The air sample ( head space ) draw e-nose pass across array chemical sensor . The size array varies , 6 32 sensor . As sensor dissimilar , interaction sensor sample unique olfactory signature complex odor create . Fields Asymmetric Waveform Ion Mobility Spectometry ( FAIMS ) new technology capable separate gas phase ion atmospheric pressure room temperature . As electronic nose , FAIMS use real time analysis complex chemical component , look total chemical composition sample . Differences way ionised molecule move high electric field use draw mobility signature complex sample . The e-nose FAIMS technique use successfully small study diagnose lung disease , diabetes , bladder cancer , tuberculosis , cyanide poisoning , renal failure schizophrenia . Focusing gastrointestinal disorder , consistent change VOCs produce patient inflammatory bowel disease , bile acid malabsorption , gastrointestinal cancer , coeliac disease , Clostridium difficile infection identify compare healthy individual . In paper publish 2012 retrospective blind pilot study use e-nose 23 patient investigator analyse stool sample collect immediately start radiotherapy . Of 23 patient select , 11 subsequently minimal side effect radiotherapy 12 severe toxicity . The e-nose analysed sample astonishingly identify 100 % accuracy two completely distinct group patient : would develop severe toxicity radiotherapy would . The result study suggest substantial difference volatile gas produce stool sample two population , critical impact toxicity reason different fermentation product occur either microbiological composition stool differs two group , bacterial function somehow different . Whatever reason , finding suggest microbiota play critical role initiation radiation induce inflammation completely consistent finding study use complex methodology study investigate role microbiota GI condition .</detailed_description>
