	<detailed_description>In traditional IGRT radiation treatment plan simulate computer use x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) image alone combination CT MRI . The CT mostly provide information attenuation radiation beam need dose simulation tumours readily identify contour MRI . However , fusion CT MR image prone error time-consuming process automate reliably . Previous research ( Stanescu et al . ) show attenuation information obtain MRI , unlike CT , use ionize radiation create image . Eliminating CT scan therefore possible beneficial patient , avoids additional dose diagnostic x ray , health care system save resource use elsewhere . Our new MRI acquisition process technique ( perform 3 tesla i.e . 3T ) enable : 1. extraction 4 different quantitative parameter ( hence `` multi-parametric MRI '' , quantitative MRI relaxometry ) normally accessible traditional MRI , 2. automatic classification tissue ( e.g . bone , air , adipose , soft tissue , etc . ) need dose computation IGRT planning In first part study ( dosimetry ) MRI method use generate pseudo-CT replace traditional CT data . The hypothesis dosimetry accurately calculate primary brain cancer patient use pseudo-CT , thus allow radiation treatment plan use MRI . The IGRT treatment plan use qMRI compare plan conventionally . The second part study ( treatment monitoring ) aim evaluate ability qMRI technique provide clinical information distinguish progression pseudo-progression , assess treatment effectiveness prognosis . The hypothesis qMRI provide increase sensitivity biological change tumor associate disease progression conventional ( T1- T2-weighted ) MRI . The reason provide quantitative , rather weight , image , direct numerical comparison make image acquire different time point different centre . With traditional MRI , limit , qualitative comparison tumor morphology relative intensity within image make . Therefore , 3 follow-up MRI scan also acquire 3 , 6 12 month treatment recurrence , transformation , pseudoprogression monitor effectiveness treatment . These technique test primary brain cancer patient undergo IGRT , follow data require : 1. patient 's IGRT treatment plan , well plan CT MRI datasets , 2. additional scanning session approximately 45 minute duration acquire MRIs patient new technique 3T . One session prior begin course radiation therapy ( first part study ) remain completion radiation treatment ( second part study ) . Traditional treatment follow-up care unchanged .</detailed_description>
