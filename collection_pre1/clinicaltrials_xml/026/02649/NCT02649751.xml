	<detailed_description>ROSCO-CF phase II , dose ranging , multicenter , double-blind , placebo control study evaluate safety effect ( R ) -roscovitine subject Cystic Fibrosis carry 2 Cystic Fibrosis cause mutation least one F508del-CFTR mutation chronically infect Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The aim study assess safety increase dos roscovitine administer orally 4 cycle 4 consecutive day ( treatment `` '' ) separate 3 day treatment free period ( treatment `` '' ) 36 adult cystic fibrosis subject . These 36 patient allocate 3 group 12 subject randomize 2:1 ratio ( active drug match placebo ) . In group , 8 patient receive roscovitine ( 200 mg , 400 mg , 2 X 400 mg group 1 , 2 3 , respectively ) 4 receive match placebo . Treatment provide oral administration capsule . Each patient receive treatment throughout 28 day study . This phase II trial give preliminary information safety hint effect new experimental treatment . If data suggest short term treatment roscovitine provide safe , effective convenient approach CF patient chronically infect Pseudomonas aeruginosa , patient participate proof concept trial offer participate long term study .</detailed_description>
