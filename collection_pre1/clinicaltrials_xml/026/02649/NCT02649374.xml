	<detailed_description>The gut microbiome : The human body colonize multitude microorganism whose collective genome , microbiome , complement enhance genome . From perspective , humans `` supra-organisms '' colonize number microbial cell 10 time great sum human somatic germ cell , carry 150 time genetic information . The intestine contain large collection microbe among body 's `` habitat '' . In colon , example , bacteria reach density 1011 cell per gram luminal content . Together , gut microbe form community , microbiota , major impact health interaction host cell ( include component innate adaptive immune system ) , extraction nutrient energy diet , complex biotransformations variety ingest compound , include potential carcinogen . One main measure test analyze bacterial population diversity - identify different microbial component population , describe similar one another ( accord phylogeny ) within sample sample . Changes gut microbiome : The majority gut microbe generally view beneficial symbionts , recent work reveal wrong combination beneficial microbe harmful . Shifts composition microbiome occur different stage life , childhood , age , pregnancy . Changes composition ( dysbiosis ) also associate grow list disease , obesity , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , diabetes , metabolic syndrome others . Such association raise question whether dysbiosis contributes , , symptom disease . Microbiome transplant experiment demonstrate role microbiome several disease : several phenotype could transfer via microbiota , enhance fat gain , metabolic syndrome , colitis recently , fecal transplantation lean human subject human subject metabolic syndrome show increase insulin sensitivity . Fecal transplantation also use successfully treat IBD patient . Together transplantation-based study imply specific composition microbiota important factor onset , possibly progression chronic disease . Thus , gut microbiota may consider , extension , factor host fitness . Diet microbiome : One factor influence composition microbiome diet . Changes diet influence relative abundance composition microbiota almost immediately , compositional change become stable , dietary change long term . A examples recent study diet impact microbiota mention . In human , increase ratio Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes observe restrict calorie/carbohydrate content . Reduced dietary intake carbohydrate also show result decrease concentration butyrate produce bacteria . The type quantity dietary fat carbohydrate also show alter gut microbiome people metabolic syndrome . Other bacteria , Prevotella example , associate high intake carbohydrate simple sugar . A diet high fiber show associated increase Bifidobacterium , Lactobacillus , Enterococcus Ruminococcus . Ruminococcus also show increase abundance subject resistant starch diet . Changes due diet also describe mouse . For example , high fat diet profoundly alter composition microbiota towards enrichment Firmicutes . The female microbiome : Women go several major physiological transition lifetime , begin puberty , follow conception , pregnancy finally menopause . During change female body undergoes hormonal , metabolic , immunological change , change microbiome.In pioneer study investigator recently show gut microbiota profoundly alter pregnancy ( change dramatically gestation ) compare non-pregnant woman . Together investigator know change female vaginal microbiome ( reduce microbial richness diversity pregnancy along enrichment Lactobacilli ) microbial change unique woman ( dramatic shift hormonal level ) - ] investigator expect different pathology correlate alteration microbiome . In proposed research , investigator aim test whether correlation gestational diabetes melitus change microbiome , well change start glucose balance diet change alter microbiome . The aim study : 1 . To find difference microbiome composition trimester healthy pregnant woman 2 . To find difference microbiome composition GDM healthy pregnant woman trimester 3 . To find difference microbiome composition balance sugar GDM diet healthy woman ( without GDM ) GDM diagnosis till third trimester</detailed_description>
