	<brief_summary>The specific aim study : Primary : To determine presence regional distribution microglial activation , assess Fluorine-18 ( 18F ) label `` Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptor 06 '' ( PBR06 ) -PET , subject active Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ( RRMS ) , Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis ( SPMS ) , Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) compare healthy control Secondary : 1 . To assess relationship microglial activation clinical variable include disease severity comorbidities ( pain , fatigue and/or depression ) , well clinical MRI finding ( lesion atrophy ) 2 . A pilot substudy aim establish non-inferiority [ F-18 ] PBR06 compare Carbon-11 [ C-11 ] label `` Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptor 28 '' ( PBR28 ) PET patient RRMS . Hypothesis : The work hypothesis microglial activation multiple sclerosis Alzheimer 's disease compare healthy control pattern/ regional distribution microglial activation different Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) versus AD correlate disease severity comorbidities . In addition , investigator hypothesize [ F-18 ] PBR06-PET scan least good [ C-11 ] PBR28-PET scan , current gold standard .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Four group subject recruit : 1 . Subjects meet definition RRMS International Panel Criteria , active , define least one MS relapse past 12 month , least one gadolinium enhance lesion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) within 3 month enrollment . 2 . Subjects meet definition SPMS International Panel Criteria demonstrate deterioration Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score last 1 year 3 . Subjects meet definition probable AD base National Institute Neurological Communicable Diseases-Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ( NINCDS-ADRDA ) criterion . In term severity disease , select subject mild AD , define Mini-Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) score 20-26 . 4 . Healthy Controls The study perform two phase . In early pilot phase , 8 subject RRMS undergo [ C-11 ] PBR28 PET scan [ F-18 ] PBR06 PET scan . At end phase , formal interim analysis perform image characteristic [ F-18 ] PBR06 find non-inferior good [ C-11 ] PBR28 , rest study complete use [ F-18 ] PBR06 . All subject also undergo 3-Tesla ( 3T ) MRI brain . The goal sample size 30 subject include 6 healthy control , 8 subject relapse remit MS , 8 subject secondary progressive MS ( SPMS ) , 8 subject AD . Subjects recruit PI , one co-investigators , staff member list protocol Partners MS Center Behavioral Neurology Clinic Brigham Women 's Hospital . Side Effects Monitoring : No side effect radiopharmaceutical expect . The dose radiopharmaceutical administer study would expect effect , include physical dependence addiction . Subjects expose small amount radiation . The radiotracer prepare way ensure sterile pyrogen free , radiochemical purity ( RCP ) determine use Silica Gel-Instant Thin Layer Chromatography and/or high pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . In addition , [ F-18 ] PBR06 [ C-11 ] PBR28 non-FDA approve radioligands , use study review Radioactive Drugs Research Committee . Subject Safety : Subject monitoring MRI PET scan perform use 2-way intercom system scanner operator subject visual monitoring subject window scan room ( subject visible operator time ) . Subjects need lie still PET camera period 120 min , subject may find uncomfortable remain still time . Therefore , mention , subject give opportunity take break 20 minute 70 minute PET scan , follow last 30 minute scan complete . A standard head-support device use make subject comfortable scan . If subject find intravenous catheter duration scan uncomfortable , free withdraw study time . The MRI scan take place confine space make people claustrophobic . Claustrophobic individual exclude study . Also scan subject hear loud banging noise therefore wear ear plug reduce noise . Recruitment Process : Physicians Partners MS Center Brigham Women 's Hospital ( BWH ) Behavioral Neurology clinic may present study subject regular schedule clinic visit . If subject interested study , copy consent form give . At time subject 's initial screen visit , license physician investigator answer question subject may regard study subsequently obtain informed consent . In accordance NIH guideline , effort make attain mix study participant , term gender racial/ethnic representation . Consent Process : Informed consent obtain subject license physician investigator study protocol . If investigator clinician MS Center Behavioral Neurology clinic , allow obtain consent patient . Existing MS Center Behavioral Neurology clinic subject may send letter describe study copy consent document . Interested subject direct contact research staff via telephone number provide letter invite participation study set screen visit . They opportunity discuss study research study staff prior give consent outline . Subjects approach participation study routine clinical visit opportunity participate study time may choose return participation another time future . All subject inform free withdraw consent study time without affect quality type care receive BWH . Subjects inform may qualify study genetic analysis reveals low affinity binder translocator protein ( TSPO ) . Monitoring Quality Assurance : During study period , subject follow clinical neurologist adverse event disease progression . If problem report physician , receive care normally perform . In addition , Principal Investigator ( PI ) review laboratory result test undergone subject study period help co-ordinate necessary care patient 's primary provider .</detailed_description>
