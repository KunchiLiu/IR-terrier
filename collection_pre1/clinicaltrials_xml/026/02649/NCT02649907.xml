	<brief_summary>Investigative trial aim 1. description hormonal metabolic response meal contain different composition macronutrients 2. metabolic response test meal dependance hepatic muscular insulin sensitivity abdominal adipose tissue 3. effect weight loss hormonal response test meal contain different composition macronutrients Primary endpoint : Glucagon-like-peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , Glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) Ghrelin response nutritive stimulation characterize different nutritional composition Secondary endpoint : - difference substrate utilization depend nutritive composition - effect different hepatic muscular insulin sensitivity well impact visceral fat mass hormonal metabolic response - effect weight loss hormonal metabolic response different test meal Study procedure : After primary characterization 50 probands ( male female ) receive 3 different test meal within randomise ( meal order ) control trial . The three different test meal differ nutritional composition . During consumption test meal characterization endogenous hormonal response appetite behaviour perform . A nutritional counselling perform accord guideline German Nutrition Society ( DGE ) ensure stable nutritive behaviour three day test meal administration . After analysis hormonal response 3 different testmeals follow weight reduction period 3 month . Afterwards reevaluation probands ( administration 3 different test meal period 3 week ) perform . Principal aim study : Gain information lead understanding hormonal regulation food intake . The individual variability shall determine aim identification patient group show various intensity responses different macronutrients .</brief_summary>
