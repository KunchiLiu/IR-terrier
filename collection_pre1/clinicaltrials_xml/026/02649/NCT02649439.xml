	<brief_summary>Background : Some people treat prostate cancer still high prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level . This may indicate cancer . These people non-metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer ( nmCSPC ) biochemical recurrent prostate cancer . Researchers think immune system teach fight kill cancer cell . They think immunotherapy vaccine call prostvac could help reduce PSA level people type prostate cancer . Objective : To test prostvac decrease tumor growth rate measure PSA compare get surveillance alone . Eligibility : Men age 18 old nmCSPC biochemical recurrent prostate cancer Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood urine test Bone scan CT scan , MRI PET scan : They lie machine take picture body . Electrocardiogram : Soft electrode stuck skin record heart signal . Participants part 1 2 arm : Arm A get prostvac 6 month . Arm B surveillance 6 month follow prostvac 6 month . During prostvac period , participant get prostvac shot skin week 1 , 3 , 5 , monthly total 5 month . Participants follow-up visit least every month recover prostvac side effect cancer worsens . Visits may include repeat screen test . Participants follow 15 year . They physical exam every year first 5 year . They phone call year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostvac Patients With Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND - Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) surveillance treatment option prostate cancer patient biochemical progression localize therapy ( biochemically recurrent prostate cancer ) . The primary goal patient prevent morbidity cancer limit toxicity . - Prostvac ( Prostvac ; develop National Cancer Institute [ NCI ] license BN Immunotherapeutics , Mountain View , CA ) novel candidate prostate cancer immunotherapy treatment prostate cancer . It viral vector base therapeutic cancer vaccine administer via subcutaneous injection . In randomized control Phase 2 trial , Prostvac therapy associate prolongation survival men metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer . A phase III trial recently complete accrual patient population . - There also rationale use therapeutic cancer vaccine Prostvac earlier stage prostate cancer patient maximize potential therapeutic effect immune stimulate therapy . - Analysis previous trial use therapeutic cancer vaccine alone suggest therapy may alter tumor growth rate . OBJECTIVE Primary Objective : -Determine therapeutic cancer vaccine prostvac decrease tumor growth rate measure PSA rise 6 month compare group get surveillance alone . KEY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA - Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate - Patients negative CT Scan Tc-99m Bone Scan - Patients PSA 0.8 ng/ml patient follow radical prostatectomy patient follow definitive radiation therapy : rise PSA great equal 2 ng/mL nadir - Patients PSA double time 5-15 month - No history active autoimmune disease history organ compromise autoimmune disease - ECOG 0-1 DESIGN - Randomized study - Accrual goal 36 evaluable patient per arm ; randomize 1:1 : - Arm A : Prostvac 6 month OR - Arm B : Surveillance 6 month , Prostvac 6 month</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Histopathological documentation prostate cancer confirm either Laboratory Pathology National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center , Walter Reed National Military Medical Center , MSKCC , DFCI prior enrollment . If pathologic specimen available , patient may enroll pathologist report show histologic diagnosis prostate cancer clinical course consistent disease . Biochemical progression define follow : For patient follow definitive therapy : rise PSA great equal 2ng/mL nadir ( per RTOGASTRO consensus criterion ) . For patient follow radical prostatectomy : rise PSA surgical procedure . ( Patients must PSA great equal 0.8 ng/ml ) ECOG performance status 0 1 ( Karnofsky great equal 80 % ) . Patients must PSA double time 515 month . Patients must rise PSA confirm 3 value do least 1 week apart less 1 month . Recovery acute toxicity relate prior therapy , include surgery radiation , toxicity great equal grade 2 . Negative CT scan/MRI bone scan metastatic prostate cancer . Hematological eligibility parameter ( within 16 day start therapy ) Granulocyte count great equal 1000/mm3 Platelet count great equal 100 000/mm3 Hgb great equal 10g/dL Biochemical eligibility parameter ( within 16 day start therapy ) : Hepatic function : bilirubin le equal 1.5mg/dL ( OR patient Gilbert syndrome normal . No active malignancy within past 36 month ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ bladder ) lifethreatening illness Willing travel NIH , MSKCC , DFCI followup visit . 18 year age old . Able understand sign inform consent . Baseline testosterone great equal 100 ng/dl PSA le equal 30 ng/mL . The effect PROSTVAC develop human fetus unknown . For reason , men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study therapy least one month post therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Immunocompromised status due : Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity . Active autoimmune diseases Addison 's disease , Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjogren syndrome , scleroderma , myasthenia gravis , Goodpasture syndrome active Grave 's disease . Patients history autoimmunity require systemic immunosuppressive therapy threaten vital organ function include CNS , heart , lung , kidney , skin , GI tract allow . Other immunodeficiency disease Splenectomy Chronic administration ( defined daily every day continue use &gt; 14 day ) corticosteroid deem systemic investigator within 28 day first plan dose PROSTVAC . Use inhaled steroid , nasal spray , topical cream small body area allow . Serious intercurrent medical illness , judgment investigator , would interfere patient ability carry treatment program . Other medication use urinary symptom include 5alpha reductase inhibitor ( finasteride dutasteride ) alternative medication know alter PSA ( eg phytoestrogens saw palmetto ) History prior chemotherapy History prior immunotherapy within last 3 year Major surgery within 4 week prior enrollment ( Day 1 visit ) . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition poxviral vaccine ( e.g. , vaccinia vaccine ) Known allergy egg , egg product , aminoglycoside antibiotic ( example , gentamicin tobramycin ) . History atopic dermatitis active skin condition ( acute , chronic , exfoliative ) disrupts epidermis Previous serious adverse reaction smallpox vaccination Unable avoid close contact household contact follow highrisk individual three week Day 1 vaccination : Day 1 vaccination : ( ) child less equal 3 year age , ( b ) pregnant nursing woman , ( c ) individual current extensive eczema eczemoid skin disorder , ( ) immunocompromised individual , HIV . Receipt investigational agent within 28 day ( 56 day antibodybased therapy ) first plan dose study drug . Patients test positive HBV HCV Uncontrolled hypertension ( SBP &gt; 170/ DBP &gt; 105 ) Recruitment Strategies This study list available website ( www.clinicaltrials.gov , http : //ccr.cancer.gov/clinicaltrialssearchstart ) participant recruit current patient population NIH .</criteria>
