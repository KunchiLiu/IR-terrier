	<brief_summary>Children particularly vulnerable respiratory virus infection , especially influenza . Vitamin A &amp; D deficiencies associate vulnerability infectious disease respiratory tract . The central hypothesis protocol vitamin supplement enhance antibody response toward flu vaccine child . Children , 2-8 year old , randomized receive influenza virus vaccine vitamin A+D supplement influenza virus vaccine placebo . Children test vitamin level immune response influenza virus vaccination determine vitamin supplementation improve influenza virus vaccine-induced immune response . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To assess vaccine-induced total antibody ( include IgG IgA ) response influenza virus vaccine administration IgA/IgG plus IgA/IgM ratios 28 56 day sera SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : - To assess neutralize response toward influenza virus vaccine serum .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influenza Virus Vaccine Plus Vitamin A D Supplements Prevention Respiratory Virus Infections Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants randomize receive either influenza virus vaccine plus Vitamins A &amp; D influenza virus vaccine plus placebo . They stratify base retinol bind protein ( RBP ) level screen , use cut-off indicative Vitamin A insufficiency ( ≤22,000 ng/ml ) . Co-enrolled sibling participant first stratify RBP level , sibling within stratum equally assigned different arm provide great assurance balance treatment assignment . Children test vitamin level immune response influenza virus vaccination determine vitamin supplementation improve influenza virus vaccine-induced antibody immune response . All participant receive two dos influenza virus vaccination administer least 28 day apart . Vitamin level antibody responses toward vaccine measure day 0 ( baseline level obtain day 0 equal first influenza virus vaccination administration ) , day 28 , day 56 . Placebo Vitamins A + D ( level 20,000 IU 2,000 IU , respectively ) administer orally day vaccination . Blood serum sample collect participant Day 0 , prior receive influenza virus vaccine Day 28 , Day 56 follow-up visit . Parents ask fill diary card indicate food intake child study period along optional food frequency questionnaire give day 56 . Specific measurement day 28 , 56 include analysis vaccine-specific total IgA , IgG , IgA/IgG plus IgA/IgM ratio serum . Functional activity antibodies toward influenza vaccine also measure .</detailed_description>
