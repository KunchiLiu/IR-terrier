	<brief_title>Deep Venous Thrombosis After Hepatobiliopancreatic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thromboembolic event common cause morbidity mortality oncological patient . Up 20 % cancer patient suffer venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) induce underlying malignancy . Oncologic gastrointestinal surgery well-known risk factor VTE . About 4-6 % patient undergoing elective hepatobiliopanreatic surgery develop deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism . However , data refer incidence DVT shortly ahead surgical event , implement certain percentage postoperative DVT might already acquire operation . Furthermore , study evaluate rate symptomatic VTE . In study , patient undergo hepatobiliopancreatic surgery screen deep venous thrombosis day surgery , third postoperative day ( primary endpoint ) 90 day operation 2-point compression sonography low extremity . The development symptomatic VTE ( DVT pulmonary embolism ) record secondary endpoint . Risk factor , perioperative morbidity / mortality presence circulate tumor cell analyze regard VTE incidence .</detailed_description>
