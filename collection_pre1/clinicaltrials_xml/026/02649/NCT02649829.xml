	<brief_summary>In phase I/II trial , dendritic cell ( DCs ) load mesothelioma-associated tumor antigen WT1 use conjunction conventional chemotherapy frontline treatment malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) . The general objective provide first-in-human experimental demonstration combination platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy WT1-targeted DC vaccination feasible safe enable induction systemic situ mesothelioma-specific immune response patient MPM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) highly aggressive virtually case fatal cancer tightly associate prior asbestos exposure . Despite improvement time , prognosis patient diagnose MPM remain dismal median overall survival diagnosis 12 month . In single arm phase I/II trial investigator want demonstrate feasibility safety WT1-targeted dendritic cell vaccination MPM patient frontline treatment conjunction first line platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy induction systemic situ mesothelioma-specific immune response . During three year recruitment investigator aim include 20 patient diagnose histologically proven epithelial MPM ( WHO grade 0-1 ) able undergo leukapheresis , chemotherapy , immunotherapy pleurectomy/decortication ( P/D ; case resectable disease ) . Patients underwent prior treatment MPM history another malignancy within last five year exclude . The intention study administer four vaccine dose combination standard care four 3-weekly cytoreductive platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy cycle participant prior surgery ( P/D ) case resectable MPM . Patients receive four 3-weekly intradermal vaccination autologous WT1 messenger ( ) RNA-loaded dendritic cell ( V1-4 ) , day 14 start chemotherapy cycle ( CT1-4 ) . The dendritic cell therapy product generate administered Antwerp University Hospital , specifically Center Cell Therapy Regenerative Medicine ( CCRG ) Division Hematology , head Prof. Zwi Berneman . The DC vaccine embargo release safety quality control test result become available release criterion meet . A detailed overview applicable release criterion provide investigational medicinal product dossier . The embargo period generally last 3 week count day cryopreservation ( i.e . 8 day leukapheresis ) . Recruitment start November 2015 . Study-related follow-up include patient intend death . In addition feasibility safety chemoimmunotherapy schedule , investigator look time progression ( TTP ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , systemic immunogenicity local immunogenicity .</detailed_description>
