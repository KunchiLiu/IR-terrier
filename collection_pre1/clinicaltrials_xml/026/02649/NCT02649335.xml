	<brief_summary>Cirrhosis lead cause death India worldwide lead cause developed world include alcoholic liver disease , hepatitis C , recently , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . As cirrhosis advance , portal hypertension develop , result complication ascites , hepatic encephalopathy , variceal hemorrhage . Ascites common major complication cirrhosis , occur 50-60 % patient within ten year diagnosis . Development ascites ominous landmark disease progression 15 % patient ascites die within 1 year , 44 % within 5 year . Less 10 % patient develop refractory ascites associate poor prognosis high mortality , approximately 50 % within 6 month 75 % 1 year median survival approximately 6 month . Refractory ascites occur result splanchnic vasodilatation maximal activation sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) renin - aldosterone system ( RAAS ) . The therapeutic option available patient serial therapeutic paracentesis , liver transplantation trans jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt .The model end stage liver disease ( MELD ) score predicts survival patient cirrhosis . However , factor patient cirrhosis ascites also associate poor prognosis , include low mean arterial pressure ; low serum sodium , low urine sodium , high Child-Pugh score . Variceal bleed dread complication cirrhosis screen endoscopic recommend patient . About 60 % patient decompensated cirrhosis varix time diagnosis . Majority patient require non selective beta blocker ( NSBB ) standard care primary secondary prophylaxis prevention variceal hemorrhage . NSBB reduce portal pressure decrease cardiac output produce splanchnic vasoconstriction.. Endoscopic variceal band ligation ( EVL ) another modality treatment esophageal varix meta-analysis show EVL associate significantly low incidence first variceal hemorrhage without difference mortality compare NSBB . NSBB also show improve survival patient nonhemodynamic effect . Some patient may progress end stage liver disease characterize development refractory ascites complication . Most study NSBB compare EVL primary/secondary prevention variceal hemorrhage include patient predominantly child A/B cirrhosis variable number ascites without mention ascites grade trial exclude patient 's refractory ascites . These patient ascites received diuretic salt restrict diet standard care . However none study mention control ascites survival benefit patient advanced stage ( child B C ) cirrhosis ascites .In recent year role NSBB prevention variceal hemorrhage refractory ascites patient question deleterious effect survival.However use NSBB end stage liver disease show mixed result controversial . Therefore study plan know effect NSBB advance stage liver disease patient ascites varix prevent variceal hemorrhage , effect ascites survival .</brief_summary>
