	<brief_summary>The ex-vivo lung evaluate XLTF-UC180 localization tumor . The ultrasound probe put lung surface several different direction obtain cross section maximum diameter . The ultrasound image size measurement tumor record use ultrasound scanner ( EU-Y0008 , OLYMPUS MEDICALSYSTEMS CORP. , Tokyo , Japan ) . Next , bronchial stump specimen open small sized endotracheal tube insert inflate deflate lung . After inflation lung , tumor evaluate XLTF-UC180 see difference ultrasound image deflate inflated lung . After ultrasound evaluation , specimen deliver directly pathology laboratory actual tumor size histological diagnosis determine . In addition , evaluate difference US image pathological morphology use HE slide lung tumor . We work together surgical team confirm sign specimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Minimally Invasive Thoracoscopic Ultrasound Localization Pulmonary Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center clinical trial . Forty patient ( sufficient initial evaluation ) schedule lobectomy anatomical segmental resection malignant lung tumor enrol study . After lung resection , lung place surgical table similar position in-vivo situation Image Guided Therapeutic operating room ( GTx-OR ) within Toronto General Hospital . The lung evaluate XLTF-UC180 localization tumor . The ultrasound probe put lung surface several different direction obtain cross section maximum diameter . The ultrasound image size measurement tumor record use ultrasound scanner ( EU-Y0008 , OLYMPUS MEDICALSYSTEMS CORP. , Tokyo , Japan ) . Next , bronchial stump specimen open small sized endotracheal tube insert inflate deflate lung . After inflation lung , tumor evaluate XLTF-UC180 see difference ultrasound image deflate inflated lung . After ultrasound evaluation , specimen deliver directory pathology laboratory actual tumor size histological diagnosis determine . In addition , evaluate difference US image pathological morphology use Hemotoxylin Eosin ( HE ) slide lung tumor . We work together surgical team confirm sign specimen .</detailed_description>
