	<detailed_description>Diurnal fluctuation intraocular pressure EX-Press Valve Blebs Glaucoma Patients Department Ophthalmology , Hillel-Yaffe Medical Center , affiliate Bruce Rappaport School Medicine , The Technion , Haifa , Israel Introduction : Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reduction mainstay glaucoma management . ( 1 ) Medication alone sometimes sufficient reduce excessively high IOP , pharmaceutical intolerance may develop damage occur optic nerve , warrant surgical intervention . ( 2 ) The filtering bleb consider cornerstone IOP control glaucoma filtration surgery drainage device implantation . ( 3 ) It enable flow aqueous humor anterior chamber subconjunctiva , episclera , sclera choroid , thereby lower IOP . ( 4-6 ) Filtration drainage device , EX-Press device ( Alcon Laboratories , Fort Worth , Texas , USA ) , offer surgical alternative glaucoma medical therapy . ( 7 ) Open-angle glaucoma ( OAG ) generally manage decrease intraocular pressure ( IOP ) level physician believe prevent glaucomatous damage . However , significant proportion patient , visual field continue deteriorate spite office pressure within range normal value ( 8 ) . It suggest progressive damage case could cause peak IOP diurnal IOP variability detect tonometry office hour . ( 9 , 10 ) In another study , Asrani et al . ( 11 ) show IOP fluctuation independent risk factor patient glaucoma may need treat specifically . It possible certain drug surgical intervention effective others dampen fluctuation . The purpose study compare diurnal IOP fluctuation glaucoma patient treated medication Ex-press filtration surgery . Materials Methods The study include 20 open-angle glaucoma ( OAG ) patient underwent Ex-Press filtration surgery , 20 OAG patient treat medication alone . All patient 12 IOP measurement 2 hour interval , start 10 AM 10 AM follow morning . ICARE速 PRO tonometer ( Icare Finland Oy , Espoo , Finland ) use measurement IOP . The rebound motion light weight probe record contact probe cornea . ( 12 , 13 ) The rate deceleration probe function IOP . The ICARE速 PRO built-in inclination sensor allow downward measurement eye supine position well normal upright sit position . ICARE速 PRO allow measurement IOP seat supine position . During IOP recording , patient supine upright , tip probe apply perpendicular cornea . Two marker engrave piston probe indicate ideal positioning . The reliability measurement display ICARE速 PRO tonometer screen guide measurement . Fluctuations IOP compare Ex-press filtration surgery eye fellow ( intra-group comparison ) . Inter-group comparison IOP fluctuation perform Ex-press filtration surgery eye medically treat eye different patient .</detailed_description>
