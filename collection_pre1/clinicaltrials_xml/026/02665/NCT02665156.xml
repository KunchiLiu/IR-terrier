	<brief_summary>Objectives Specific Aims Time efficiency robot assist radical cystectomy ( RARC ) totally intracorporeal staple orthotopic neobladder remain main drawback procedure . According recent consensus panel , benchmark intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder 5 hour high volume center . This prospective single-stage phase 2 trial design assess time efficiency use robotic stapler versus conventional motorized stapler ( Linear stapler articulate Endo GIAâ„¢ , Covidien ) achieve target outcome ( total operative time &lt; 5 hr ) . Perioperative complication ( intraoperative 30-d postoperative complication accord Clavien classification system ) , 30-d/90-d/ 180-d complication readmission rate , early functional outcome ( time recovery urinary continence ) , 180-d 360-d neobladder stone formation rate analyze assess safety cost effectiveness procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary end point sample size determine total operative time &lt; 5hr . In last 50 case series ( data unpublished ) benchmark obtain 60 % patient ( p0 ) , expect improve time efficiency procedure use robotic stapler maintain total operative time procedure &lt; 5hrs least 80 % ( p1 ) case . According A'Hern , order verify significance hypothesis , estimate sample size 33 patient power 80 % significance level 5 % . The trial successful total operative time &lt; 5hrs least 25 33 patient . The population study include 35 patient muscle invasive bladder cancer without contraindication orthotopic neobladder . The first two case exclude order provide entire surgical team minimal skill necessary proper time efficient use new surgical device ( robotic stapler ) . The follow 33 consecutive case enrol outcomes analyze . The estimated time complete enrollment 9 month .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Pathologically confirm muscle invasive bladder cancer recurrent high grade urothelial carcinoma ( BCG failure ) All absoulte contraindication orthotopic neobladder ; Anesthesiologic contraindication penumoeperitoneum steep Trendelenburg position . cT4 disease ; clinical evidence metastasis ( cM1 ) outside pelvis .</criteria>
