	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Combination Nintedanib/Placebo Combination With Induction Chemotherapy Patients With Refractory First Relapse Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct Phase 1/Phase 2 trial . The primary objective Phase 1 determine safety tolerability combination Nintedanib + induction chemotherapy patient acute myeloid leukemia . The primary objective Phase 2 determine efficacy ( rate CR/CRp/CRi ) Nintedanib+ induction v Placebo+ induction . The secondary objective study include : determine overall response rate accord IWG AML 2003 criterion , toxicity profile safety combination , percentage patient bridge transplantation , overall survival , leukemia free survival include analysis censoring HSCT rate haematological improvement accord IWG MDS 2006 criterion . In addition , exploratory correlative study conduct .</detailed_description>
