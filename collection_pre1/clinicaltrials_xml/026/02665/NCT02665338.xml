	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking cause significant morbidity mortality United States . Smoking cessation difficult , average smoker attempt quit five time permanent success . Moreover , majority smoking quit attempt result relapse . Brain stimulation smoke cessation excite new area build advance neuroscience knowledge concern functional neurocircuitry addiction . Cortical stimulation perform non-invasively transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . Several study show TMS reduce cue-elicited craving smoker . Previous research group show single session 15 minute high frequency ( 10 Hz ) repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) 100 % motor threshold leave dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) reduce cue-induced craving compare sham TMS . However , mechanism crave reduce rTMS poorly understood behavioral neural level . Neuroimaging study nicotine dependence reveal cue-related response numerous brain area , include frontal , parietal cortex subcortical area . Recently functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study group show cue-induced craving induce brain activation ventral medial prefrontal cortex ( VMPFC ) , include medial frontal , orbital frontal anterior cingulate . This Chair Research Development Fund ( CRDF ) pilot proposal integrate two new techniques- TMS fMRI investigate DLPFC-VMPFC pathway smoker . Using double-masked method investigator hypothesize cue-induced exposure induce brain activity VMPFC , 15 minute rTMS DLPFC reduce cue-induced crave modulate DLPFC-VMPFC pathway ( increased activity DLPFC decrease activity VMPFC ) .</brief_summary>
