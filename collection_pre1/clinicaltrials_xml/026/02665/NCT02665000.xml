	<detailed_description>2 . Background clinical significance 2.1 Background The use simulate training popularized surgical technique provide spatial task orient train vital surgery . As junior resident perform laparoscopic appendectomy supervision registrar , concern patient safety early exposure without prior structured training program question . Furthermore , procedure perform office hour center , performance procedure junior doctor may result high conversion rate accord retrospective study do center.1 A recent leading article Kordowicz et al state challenge importance validate simulator train individual centers.2 2.2 Potential clinical significance The investigator propose validated training program allow safe training environment junior resident . This help provide standard laparoscopic training program use training future batch surgical trainee couple improved learning curve surgical technique . Studies do locally overseas also show presence junior doctor operation potentially increase operating time poor surgical outcomes.3,4 Therefore , investigator also hope validated training program resident , translate improve patient outcome safety . 2.3 Potential benefit participant Direct benefit subject include provision structured training program participant randomize Group A . Subjects group also receive critical assessment feedback laparoscopic skill , thus contribute development surgical skill . 3 . Methods Approach 3.1 Methodology A randomize control trial junior surgical resident le 10 laparoscopic appendectomy ' experience first surgeon recruit . They randomize either Group A Group B ( control ) . 3.2 Participants selection Junior surgical resident le 10 laparoscopic appendectomy ' experience first surgeon recruit . Up 20 case laparoscopic appendectomy show number require junior resident become competent procedure.5 Residents post-graduate year 1 ( PGY-1 ) exclude study . This PGY-1 resident require perform House Officer ( HO ) duty participate perform laparoscopic appendectomy procedure . Therefore , surgical resident PGY-2 PGY-5 recruit . 3.3 Training Program Participants Group A undergo 5 day train program laparoscopic appendectomy use Box Trainer Wet Trainer , whereas Group B receive additional training week . Each training session take 2 hour . Both group expose standard training current practice 5 supervised case laparoscopic appendectomy . After train , require perform another 5 case laparoscopic appendectomy perform surgeon supervision train surgeon . The operation record grade base validated GOALS score system 6 ( Appendix A ) . The Primary Outcome difference GOALS result 2 group . Secondary outcome include OSAT score ( Appendix B ) , patient outcome , resident ' feedback score well conversion rate open surgery . 3.4 Conducting study The study subject randomly assign computer-generated randomization process receive either structured training program prior standard current training practice ( Group A ) standard current training practice ( Group B , control ) . A power calculation perform assess number participant require control intervention group . To detect difference GOALS score 4 , assume alpha 0.05 , power 0.80 , minimum number subject need 16 . All recruit resident go aptitude test simulator ensure comparability 2 group prior intervention . Residents Group A receive 2 hour supervise training trained surgeon per day 5 day . The 2 hour include 30 minute discussion training case day , 1 hour hand practice Box Trainer well Wet Training follow 30 minute feedback session . Both group expose 5 case laparoscopic appendectomy train surgeon per current training practice . The participant would grade next 5 case laparoscopic appendectomy perform . The assessment include GOALS scoring : 1 . The supervise registrar 2 . 2 consultant surgeon grade resident 's performance individually base video record surgery The study single-blinded assessor know group resident belong . Blinding resident would possible study . However , would affect result primary outcome . The laparoscopic appendectomy perform within time period 6 month study show effect laparoscopic training persist beyond 6 month without reinforcement.7 Feedback score collate resident completion study . The feedback score detail level confidence resident performance assess case compare 2 group . A short summary process follow : 1 . Consent subject obtain 2 . Pre-intervention aptitude assessment do Group A B 3 . 5 day structure train program subject Group A 4 . Both group repeat aptitude test . 5 . Both group perform 5 training case supervise trained surgeon , current training standard . 6 . Assessment subsequent 5 case laparoscopic appendectomy subject group do senior surgeon assist case well 2 independent consultant surgeon . This scored GOALS assessment . 7 . Feedback score level confidence competence perform 5 assessed case collate subject 3.5 Advantages study methodology Thus far , locally validate training program literature . The study laparoscopic study conduct validated overseas tend focus whether use particular training tool ( e.g . use laparoscopic stimulator , didactic lecture etc . ) useful improve learn curve trainee . Therefore , research methodology unique attempt integrate different training modality prove improve train curve one seamless train program trainee . This seamless training include didactic lecture well train multiple different modality , show international journal improve learn curve trainee . 3.6 Potential limitation study Potential limitation include 1 . The difficulty level case appendectomy different . This effect mitigate randomization subject 2 group . In addition , GOALS assessment take consideration level difficulty particular case reflect final score . 2 . The amount intervention registrar assist surgery subject differ . The GOALS assessment take account allow registrar quantify amount assistance render intra-operatively . This thus reflect final score . 3.7 Potential harm/ hazard participants patient There potential risk patient study control arm resident receive supervision current day practice . All patient study also go standard care laparoscopic appendectomy additional cost borne patient . Similarly , participant Group B ( undergo training program ) , participant form disadvantage still undergo current training protocol . 3.8 Analyzing data All information record consolidated central form participant . The information obtain keep confidential kept office principal investigator ( PI ) . Access information give PI , co-PI collaborator . The result trial analyzed completion data collection . There preliminary analysis .</detailed_description>
