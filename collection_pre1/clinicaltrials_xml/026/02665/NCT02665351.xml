	<brief_summary>Peramivir first intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor ( NAI ) available treatment uncomplicated influenza adult . Data placebo-controlled trial outpatient show antiviral efficacy , safety , tolerability . Although unmet need intravenous therapy lie mainly patient hospitalize complicated disease , data limit feasibility ethical consideration placebo-controlled study . In study , investigator aim examine specifically treatment effect peramivir adult hospitalize influenza-associated low respiratory tract complication ( LRTC ) . Such finding may important implication clinical management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peramivir Treatment Response Adults Hospitalized Influenza-associated Lower Respiratory Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective ass virologic response peramivir influenza-associated low respiratory tract complication ( LRTC ) . The secondary objective ass safety tolerability . Adults confirm influenza polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and/or immunofluorescence assay seasonal peak 2011-2014 assessed eligibility . Consented individual randomize receive either peramivir 600mg every 24 hourly 300mg every 12 hourly 5 day . In subject achieve clinical resolution day 5 , regimen could continue day 10 ( virologic result unknown clinician ) .Renal-dosage adjustment , require , perform accord protocol . The study 's primary endpoint change influenza RNA load time . The secondary endpoint viral shed indicated culture RNA negativity day 5 , drug tolerability . Additionally , priori comparison endpoint historical control treat standard course oral oseltamivir ( 75mg bid 5 day ) clinical setting perform .</detailed_description>
