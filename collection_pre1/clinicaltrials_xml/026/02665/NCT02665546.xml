	<brief_title>Evaluation Exercise Capacity Exercise Limitation Patients With Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Langerhans cell antigen-presenting cell monocyte-macrophage lineage present various epithelium like airway . Langerhans cell histiocytosis ( LCH ) , also call histiocytosis X pulmonary eosinophilic granulomatosis , characterize proliferation infiltration Langerhans cell affect organ , include skin , lung , bone , pituitary gland , liver , lymph node thyroid gland . Several clinical presentation describe . In pediatric population , clonal neoplastic process responsible acute disseminate form ( Letterer-Siwe syndrome ) multifocal form ( Syndrome Hand-Schuller-Christian ) , unfavorable prognosis . In adult , LCH may affect one several organ multisystemic disease . The pulmonary form usually sporadic occur almost exclusively smoker , smoke history least 20 pack-years . It believe , unlike systemic form , exposure tobacco antigens generate polyclonal response recruitment accumulation Langerhans cell throughout interstitium small airway . LCH rare condition . The prevalence 3.4 % find series 502 surgical lung biopsy may underestimate , many patient may improve spontaneously may asymptomatic diagnosis define base radiological finding . The main clinical feature cough , dyspnea respiratory failure . The mean age diagnosis 20 40 year . Men woman equally affect , probably reflect characteristic smoke habit nowadays . In study Vassallo colleague , median survival 12.5 year diagnosis death patient LCH , low describe general population . Among predictor poor prognosis In study predictor bad prognosis include obstructive pattern , air trap reduction carbon monoxide diffuse capacity ( DLCO ) pulmonary function test . The diagnosis pulmonary LCH may establish combination compatible clinical radiological finding smoke patient . In high-resolution compute tomography , typical pattern coexistence cyst nodule , predominantly upper middle lobe , tends spare basal portion lung . Moreover , interstitial infiltrates , reticular density architectural distortion degree may find . Computed tomography , others cystic lung disease , useful monitoring disease progression ass treatment response . In case , histopathological examination may necessary , preferably surgical biopsy , transbronchial transthoracic biopsy may sufficient select patient . In pathology , LCH present focal change , separate apparently normal lung parenchyma , diffuse distribution bronchiolar predominance presence Langerhans cell organize loose granuloma lymphocytic infiltrate . Lesions apparently different age find : Initially , eccentric infiltration wall respiratory bronchiole find , promote gradual destruction . Inflammatory cell Langerhans cell also present . In advanced disease , lesion replace stellar fibrotic scar border cystic space different size . In electron microscopy , Birbeck granule may identify , numerous cell associated disease normal Langerhans cell . The immunohistochemical staining show membrane antigen cell surface Langerhans cell , S100 CD1a - latter specific - confirms diagnosis . Up 15 % pulmonary function test may normal patient LCH . The early finding reduce DLCO . The frequent change airflow obstruction air trap . Restriction find advanced case . In 102 patient LCH evaluate Vassallo colleague , mean DLCO 64 % predict , restrictive obstructive disorder find , respectively , 27.2 % 45.7 % patient . Smoking cessation mandatory treatment patient pulmonary LCH , isolate therapy determine partial complete resolution stabilization lesion majority patient . In patient , corticosteroid cytotoxic agent , cladribine etoposide , may necessary . However , lack robust evidence benefit medication . Lung transplantation consider advanced case . Extrapulmonary involvement LCH occur approximately 15 % adult affect bone , skin pituitary , may cause diabetes insipidus . Pneumothorax one common complication pulmonary LCH , find 4-17 % patient . Recurrence pneumothoraxcan high , especially conservative treatment perform . Pulmonary vascular involvement associate LCH increasingly discuss described literature . Evidence suggest contribution pathophysiology significant previously believe . Dauriat colleague find presence pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) 92 % LCH patient evaluate lung transplantation . Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) consist involvement pulmonary vasculature , mean pulmonary artery pressure ( Mpap ) , measure right heart catheterization rest , great equal 25 mmHg . This criterion may apply pulmonary capillary pressure end expiration le 15 mmHg . In second International Symposium Pulmonary Hypertension , occur Evian ( France ) 1998 , PH classify accord pathophysiological basis divide five group : 1 - pulmonary arterial hypertension ; 2 - relate left heart disease ; 3 - secondary chronic lung disease hypoxemia ; 4 - chronic pulmonary thromboembolism 5 - Miscellaneous . This classification several change since 1998 Fifth Symposium , occur 2013 Nice ( France ) . LCH currently include group 5 PH , contain multifactorial etiology pulmonary hypertension cause yet fully elucidate . However , since LCH present parenchymal abnormality , PH disease may secondary hypoxemia thus belong group 3 , believe remodel parenchyma , result , hypoxemia determine reduction cross-sectional area vessel , promotes increase pulmonary vascular resistance . This mechanism explain vast majority patient COPD GOLD IV present mPAP 20 mmHg , despite fact progression PH case slow , rate less 1 mmHg increase per year . In less 5 % patient , mPAP exceed 40 mmHg , value increase contribution cardiovascular component exercise limitation . In group 3 , presence HP strong predictor mortality , directly proportional mPAP . In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , survival inversely proportional value force vital capacity . Vascular change distant area parenchymal abnormality typical LCH suggest mechanism involve pathophysiology disease , still need elucidate . It believe production inflammatory cytokine growth factor activate granuloma cause pulmonary vascular remodeling . Moreover , granuloma directly infiltrate artery promote luminal obstruction , fibrosis hypertrophy intima medium . Fartoukh colleague retrospectively evaluate 12 lung biopsy patient LCH find arterial venular change , respectively , 60 % 75 % . Veno-occlusive-like disease see one third patient . In patient symptoms limitation exercise fully explain parenchymal abnormality , mean disproportionately low DLCO compare lung volume , predominant component pulmonary arterial hypertension , group 1 , benefit specific therapy proven . Furthermore , level pulmonary artery pressure find patient HCL similar find patient group 1. mPAP level higher patient LCH compare find patient COPD IPF , high impairment lung volume . Some report case series demonstrate symptomatic improvement , also survival , exercise capacity parameter right heart catheterization use single combine use pulmonary vasodilator phosphodiesterase inhibitor ( tadalafil ) , endothelin receptor antagonist ( bosentan ) analogues prostacyclin ( epoprostenol ) patient LCH . Thus , important establish correct diagnosis also classification pulmonary hypertension order define appropriate treatment , may result increase survival improvement quality life use specific therapy patient classify group 1 . On hand , side effect expense medication may prevent patient PH include group 3 , main focus correction hypoxemia , treatment parenchymal disease . Echocardiography safe cost-effective method screen evaluation PH patient . Data prevalence PH patient LCH scarce previous study include patient advanced disease undergo evaluation transplantation . A study evaluate patient disease different severity certainly contribute understand influence vascular parenchymal component patient LCH .</detailed_description>
