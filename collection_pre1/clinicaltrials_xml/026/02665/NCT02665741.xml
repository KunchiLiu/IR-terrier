	<brief_title>Comparison Colon Adenoma Detection Rate Using Two Distal Colonoscope Attachments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although mortality colon cancer decreasing , remain second lead cause cancer relate death United States . There multiple factor contribute decrease , increase awareness , improve screen technique , etc . Of available modality approve colon cancer screen United States , colonoscopy consider gold standard . Colonoscopy advantage diagnostic therapeutic , allow removal pre-cancerous polyp , polyp transform cancer . Colonic polyp occur location rectum cecum . Colonoscopy show effective decrease incidence cancer leave colon remains limited detection right side polyps /lesions 2 . This difference base location think due several reason . Typically right side colon less clean leave side colonoscopy , thereby impair visualization polyp . This problem overcome incorporate `` split bowel preparation '' , become standard care . However , problem able visualize polyp behind fold see colon persist despite improvement quality cleanse colon . Various endoscopic technology introduce goal assist manipulation colonic fold , thereby reduce chance miss polyp behind fold . Two colonoscope assist device include distal transparent cap Endocuff endoscopic overtube . The Endocuff overtube small device flexible arm arrange 2 row . Each row 8 short , soft arm project away device . These arm use peel back colonic fold without cause physical damage enable visualization behind colonic fold . The use Endocuff overtube show promising result term cecal intubation rate time well adenoma detection rate 3 . The transparent cap attachment clear plastic device fit end colonoscope extend short distance past tip colonoscope . It aid manipulation fold maintain suitable distance mucosa , goal improve visualization . Although study compare cap fit colonoscopy standard ( non- attachment ) colonoscopies show improved adenoma detection 4 , others show significant benefit 5 . Although , device compare conventional colonoscopy ( i.e without distal attachment ) , investigator 's knowledge , currently study compare two distal colonoscope attachment device head-to-head , none specifically evaluated effect detection right side adenoma . Also , UCDavis , device use specifically diagnostic colonoscopy removal large polyp choice specific device use dependends level comfort advance endoscopist . The endoscopists participate investigator ' study currently use device part routine colonoscopy , thus important provide head head comparison device help guide management practice . Therefore , investigator ' goal compare Endocuff overtube assist , transparent cap fit , non-cap fit ( standard ) colonoscopy patient present UC Davis Medical Center screen colonoscopy . In addition , 2 3 investigator employ water exchange method arm trial , investigator employ conventional air method colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
