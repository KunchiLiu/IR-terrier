	<detailed_description>Background Significance Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome ( PRES ) clinical-radiological syndrome . It first describe Hinchey et al . 1996 . It characterize variable combination headache , seizure , alter mental status , visual impairment , nausea , vomit focal neurological sign accompany symmetric vasogenic edema bilateral posterior cerebral circulation territory . PRES associate multiple risk factor , renal dysfunction , hypertension , cytotoxic drug , autoimmune disease pre-eclampsia eclampsia , occur wide range disease predispose factor . Lesions usually locate parietal occipital region . However , lesion may also involve unilateral cerebral hemisphere , anterior circulation area deep brain structure . According location lesion , five distribution pattern describe : mainly parietal-occipital pattern , superior frontal sulcus pattern , holo-hemispheric watershed pattern , partial asymmetric expression primary pattern central pattern . In addition , cytotoxic edema associate diffusion restriction , abnormal enhancement due blood brain barrier disruption , hemorrhage , infarction atypical finding may occasionally detect . PRES associate variety clinical condition . The occurrence PRES affect age gender , may present age group . The occurrence PRES may result either breakdown cerebral autoregulation disruption blood brain barrier , cause vasogenic edema endothelial dysfunction result circulate toxic mediator , sepsis , autoimmune condition , eclampsia . Up , pathophysiological mechanism PRES still clear , cerebral autoregulation impairment endothelial dysfunction consider important potential mechanism . PRES usually favourable prognosis . The clinical imaging finding often reversible underlying cause eliminate blood pressure control . Even , many patient still permanent neurological sequela mortality 5 % -15 % . Known risk factor PRES include hypertension , renal disease immunosuppressive therapy , researcher also find lymphopenia dyslipidemia potential risk factor PRES . The prognostic factor PRES include presence PRES risk factor , duration symptom , presence cytotoxic edema hemorrhage . Alhilali et al . retrospective analysis etiology , image finding cerebrospinal fluid examination 47 PRES patient lumbar puncture show clinical factor , image finding , cerebrospinal fluid laboratory result affect prognosis PRES , low CSF glucose , hypertensive encephalopathy , image finding hemorrhage increase risk fatal outcome , toxemia pregnancy find relatively protective effect . Recent research show correlation MRI finding LDH albumin level , suggest biochemical index may use prognostic factor . Although various risk factor PRES relate imaging finding well describe , previous study , relationship clinical factor , image finding , laboratory examination result prognosis PRES analyze respectively different investigator , relative effect prognosis remain unclear consistent conclusion . Here use multi-center approach conduct study ensure large patient sample . This propose multi-center retrospective study analyze factor influence prognosis patient PRES . The aim research study connection different cause , different imaging finding , laboratory finding clinical outcome patient PRES deepen understanding nature PRES . The pathogenesis PRES discuss base result obtain . This contribute predict prognosis patient PRES investigate pathogenesis PRES guide clinical treatment follow-up evaluation . Research Design Methods 1 . Overall Design The Research A multi-center retrospective case study , secure require Institutional Review Board approval , perform January 2016 July 2015 patient complete inpatient clinical record meet criterion 10 sub-centers include . Patients ' demographic data , clinical data , auxiliary examination , image finding follow-up data collect summarized . The imaging finding patient assess two neuroimaging physician , difference agree upon consensus . Following , connection different cause , different imaging finding , laboratory finding clinical outcome posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome analyze . 2 . Patients Grouping A total 400 patient complete inpatient clinical record meet criterion 10 sub-centers include research . The patient divide several subgroup accord cause disease , include hypertensive encephalopathy , cytotoxic drug , toxemia pregnancy ( pre-eclampsia eclampsia ) , autoimmune disease disease ( anemia , hypomagnesemia , infection , sepsis , etc. ) . 3 . Data Acquisition The following information collect review medical record follow-up patient meet inclusion criterion : Basic information : demographic sociological characteristic patient , name , gender , age ; Clinical date : include history past illness , etiology , symptom ( headache , seizure , visual disturbance , nausea vomiting , alter mental status , focal neurological sign , etc . ) , blood pressure/MAP time attack , therapeutic measure , time symptom onset control causative factor , hospitalization , etc . Examination identify cause PRES : include blood biochemical examination ( enzyme , metabolite , mineral , blood protein , etc . ) , lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid examination , EEG , blood gas analysis , etc . Imaging examination : include time PRES onset MRI examination , location lesion , distribution pattern edema , degree edema , cytotoxic edema appear , abnormal enhance appear , hemorrhage appear , MRA DSA examination , perfusion weight imaging , etc . Follow-up : Time interval PRES onset MRI follow-up ; Follow imaging finding ; Prognosis observation : discharge status , include partial complete recovery abnormal imaging , hemorrhagic ischemic complication appear , continue medication treatment ( antihypertensive drug , anticonvulsant drug , etc . ) , death ; time symptom onset recovery image abnormality ; recurrence interval time ; increase patient 's current MRI blood biochemical examination ; patient ' mRS score time onset , discharge follow-up achieve review case follow-up . 4 . Data Analysis All data save database . In study review etiology image finding , laboratory follow-up data patient select . Univariate multivariate analysis perform within group group accord subgroup . In research prognosis patient assess use modify Rankin scale ( mRS ) score . Single PRES related factor test Chi-square test . Intergroup comparison perform use student t-test normally distributed variable Mann-Whitney U test variable normally distribute . In binary variable analysis , logistic regression analysis use analysis factor related PRES . In polytomous variable analysis , multivariate logistic regression analysis perform analyze factor related PRES . 5 . Quality Control The patient identify strictly accordance establish inclusion exclusion criterion . The imaging finding patient assess 2 neuroimaging physician consensus reach consultation difference . The member group assess prognosis PRES unify training . Timeline Events Patients screen data acquisition phase . The project schedule initiate April 2016 complete data collection July 2016 . Data analysis phase . We plan complete data analysis 4 month data acquisition complete . Paper publishing stage . We plan complete paper publish 6 month data analysis finish . Data opening phase . We plan open data society stage paper publishing complete .</detailed_description>
