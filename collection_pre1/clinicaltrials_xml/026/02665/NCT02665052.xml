	<brief_summary>Loss arm use strength common problem stroke greatly affect independence activity daily live . Arm rehabilitation use robot-assisted repetitive task train show improve motor recovery . However , type exercise do home device large expensive . This study test whether portable , less costly , non-robotic repetitive training device call Bilateral Arm Training Rhythmic Auditory Cuing ( BATRAC ) perform home tele-rehabilitation format lead improvement arm hand use patient chronic stroke . The investigator plan test effectiveness home base tele-rehabilitation BATRAC compare clinic base approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Translating Intensive Arm Rehabilitation Stroke Telerehabilitation Format</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This longitudinal , single blind , randomize control trial three parallel 6 week intervention arm conduct three-year time period . After obtain informed consent , complete baseline testing , participant randomize one three study arm : 1 ) Home-based BATRAC Telerehab ( HBT ) + TTT , 2 ) Lab-based BATRAC ( LBB ) + TTT , 3 ) Delayed Entry Usual Care . This delayed entry group serve control initial six week enrollment NOT receive active study intervention randomize one two active intervention . Weekly phone call conduct control period record general activity ( household community ) monitor amount intensity arm use . Participants complete Home-based BATRAC training Lab-based BATRAC training three time week 6-9 week total 18 training session . Participants ask return follow-up 8 week training . A study evaluator blind intervention assignment complete outcome measure baseline , train completion , 8 week retention follow-up . The participant Home-based BATRAC telerehabilitation group give VA 's MyHealtheVet ( www.myhealth.va.gov ) website account asynchronous communication therapist access educational feature resource stroke , exercise caregiver support . The intervention describe . 1 . Home-based BATRAC telerehabilitation : The BATRAC training platform use conjunction VA MyHealtheVet website . This group MyHealtheVet account access Secure Messaging Option VA approve electronic messaging study therapist . The MyHealtheVet provide asynchronous communication study therapist , store performance information enter participant caregiver relate arm exercise duration , repetition complete distance reach . This account securely link VA approve use home device ( computer , cell phone tablet ) internet . MyHealtheVet training complete VA one-time home visit participant identify caregiver verify access , use . BATRAC train consist 45 minute high intensity bilateral reach rest period ( see Lab-based BATRAC training detail ) follow 15 minute video guide Transition Task Training ( TTT ) . These video link VA MyHealtheVet site study specific Youtube video demonstrate exercise . The initial training occur lab set therapist BATRAC instruction TTT exercise training . The participant caregiver opportunity ask question develop proficiency training session . For TTT , functional task present via MyHealtheVet Secure Messaging ( SM ) link URL instructive Youtube video clip exercise sequencing , level difficulty . After completion exercise session participant complete study report form attach SM . This information available off-line assessment performance research therapist . In case participant non-adherence , therapist contact participant via phone review exercise barrier motivate individual participate . If necessary , therapist could change exercise parameter send change within My HealtheVet SM . A video training set-up complete VA start end intervention monitor adherence consistency TTT activity . 2 . Lab-based BATRAC + TTT training : Participants randomize group receive 60 minute train lab ( 45 minute use BATRAC 15 minute TTT ) . The BATRAC training consist high intensity bilateral reach retrieving ( push handle away pull back ) constrain linear track promote maximum arm extension . The track set different angle work space . The training protocol group consist four , 5-minute period intersperse 5-minute rest period avoid fatigue . An auditory metronome set initially participant 's prefer speed period 1 3 participant move arm simultaneously ( in-phase ) . In period 2 4 participant move arm alternate ( antiphase ) movement . A fifth bout simultaneous arm movement include reach 45 minute training goal . Progression auditory cue frequency , direction travel ( pushing/pulling diagonal ) distance reach progress every 3 session base performance . If progression sustain five-minute bout end session , adjustment towards previous level make . This training follow 15 minute transition task training ( TTT ) describe supervision support need therapist . Transition Task Training ( TTT ) : Each participant receive 45 minute randomize BATRAC intervention follow 15 minute TTT . This training functionally base four domain real-world task : homemaking , hygiene , feeding , dress . Two goal direct functional task select four domain every two week prescribe individual base severity level , general interest goal . The task design progressive nature difficulty add change parameter ( movement amplitude ) demand ( resistance ) increase generalization real life challenge . Assist therapist caregiver provide prevent compensatory movement re-enforced . For home-based training , caregiver instruct provide assistance initial personal training well access set videos task . 3 . Delayed Entry Usual Care : Participants randomize group initially serve control receive study intervention except protocol study evaluation time interval receive active intervention weekly phone call record general activity level . After serve control , group enter delay active intervention group either lab-based BATRAC + TTT training , Lab-based Robot+ TTT .</detailed_description>
