	<brief_summary>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) investigational device approve treatment medical condition FDA allow use research purpose . In clinical trial tDCS associate pain relief decrease intensity duration chronic pain . tDCS potentially work stimulate brain deliver extremely low-level electrical current area forehead - area associate chronic pain . It anticipate current increase brain activity likelihood brain activity area , affect individual 's ability regulate pain . The purpose study compare eligible participant Pain Management Program The Menninger Clinic receive adjunctive real transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) versus receive sham tDCS resolution chronic pain . The primary objective : ( 1 ) improve pain tolerance ( 2 ) improve subjective pain experience . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) improve subjective experience sleep quality ( 2 ) increase physical activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic persistent pain pain continue present ; ongoing recurrent pain , last beyond usual course acute illness injury , unfavorably affect individual 's well-being . The Institute Medicine ( 2011 ) estimate 116 million American adult experience chronic pain direct indirect cost US economy total excess half trillion dollar annually . Current treatment chronic pain partially effective , especially use alone . There critical need develop new effective treatment chronic pain . Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) may helpful additional treatment patient chronic pain . Doctors scientist conduct research study want evaluate effectiveness investigational device ( tDCS ) delivers form brain stimulation additional treatment standard care Menninger Clinic 's Pain Management Program . Stimulation tDCS adjunctive medication-based treatment well non-medication treatment option ( physical therapy psychotherapy ) may improve individual 's ability tolerate physical emotional distress associate chronic pain . Therefore investigator propose engage clinical trial adjunctive tDCS chronic pain , restrict enrollment population receive service Pain Management Program .</detailed_description>
