	<brief_title>InterStim Implantation Rates Following Percutaneous Nerve Evaluation With Fluoroscopy Versus Without</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) well-established treatment refractory urinary urgency , frequency , retention urge incontinence well fecal incontinence . Patients whose symptoms refractory conservative therapy behavioral modification and/or medication candidate SNS . The InterStim system consist permanent tin lead implantable pulse generator ( IPG ) battery delivers sacral neuromodulation . This device typically implanted patient successful response trial sacral neuromodulation temporary lead external battery . The temporary lead placement know Percutaneous Nerve Evaluation ( PNE ) typically do outpatient procedure use local anesthetic . It standard practice use fluoroscopy intraoperatively confirm correct placement permanent lead . Additionally , physician also use fluoroscopy confirm correct placement temporary lead PNE others place lead base anatomical landmark expect elicited response S3 stimulation . The investigator propose randomize control trial compare rate implantation InterStim device follow ( PNE ) perform without fluoroscopic guidance .</detailed_description>
