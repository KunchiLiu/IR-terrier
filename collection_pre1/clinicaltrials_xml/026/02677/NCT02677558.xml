	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : The prevalence obesity increase alarm rate worldwide . The impact obesity cardiovascular health well document , much less known impact obesity pregnancy maternal cardiac function . The aim current study investigate cardiovascular system morbidly obese woman adapt circulatory change associate pregnancy . BACKGROUND : Overweight obesity major threat global health . In 2013 , 36.9 % men 38 % woman worldwide overweight obese define BMI ≥25 kg/m2 ≥30 kg/m2 respectively . According systematic analysis Global Burden Disease Study 2013 , South Africa rank third list world 's obese nation behind United States Mexico . The prevalence overweight ( BMI ≥25kg/m2 ) obesity ( BMI ≥30kg/m2 ) combine age group 20 year estimate 38.8 % men 69.3 % woman South Africa . In age group 20 year , 18.8 % boys 26.3 % girl . 42 % woman age 20 year 9.6 % girl 20 year consider obese . The impact obesity structure function heart well document . Obesity strongly associate risk factor development atherosclerotic disease hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes . In addition , evidence obesity lead structural functional change heart . The following change commonly encounter obesity : 1 . Left ventricular remodelling : Many study report obesity associate increase leave ventricular mass ( LV mass ) . LV mass commonly index body surface area ( BSA ) . In set significant obesity , LV mass/BSA often normal reduce , BSA increase LV mass . Many investigator therefore choose index LV mass lean body mass , height height raise power 2.76 . Recent study agree wall thickness cavity size seem increase obesity , wall thickness increase great extent , lead concentric pattern leave ventricular hypertrophy obesity . 2 . Right ventricular size : Only study look change right ventricle obesity . Wong et al . find mild increase RV cavity size wall thickness uncomplicated obesity . 3 . Left atrial size : Obesity associate increase leave atrial size . Hypertension , volume overload diastolic filling abnormality commonly lead increase leave atrial size . All commonly present obesity . 4 . Left ventricular systolic function : Recent study report LV ejection fraction preserve obesity even normal . There , however subclinical contractile abnormality already find obese child adolescent comparable find adult obese subject . 5 . Left ventricular diastolic function : The common finding isovolumetric relaxation time prolonged obesity . Reduced tissue doppler velocity also report . 6 . Right ventricular function : Reduced RV systolic diastolic function report individual BMI ≥35kg/m2 . It well establish obesity pregnancy associate increase risk thromboembolism , preeclampsia , postpartum haemorrhage , caesarean section instrumental delivery . The impact obesity pregnancy might however reach even . A well conduct retrospective study publish Hypertension year find association obesity pregnancy premature mortality morbidity major cardiovascular event later life . It think cardio-metabolic change obese pregnancy potentially unmask patient risk cardiovascular event later life . Transthoracic echocardiography detect subclinical alteration cardiac structure function . It non-invasive bear risk mother baby . A routine assessment haemodynamic status obese pregnant woman therefore potential establish woman increase risk haemodynamic complication pregnancy and/or later life . However , limited number study haemodynamic change morbidly obese parturients assess transthoracic echocardiography . STUDY OBJECTIVES : Hypothesis : 1 . We hypothesise cardiac dysfunction determine transthoracic echocardiography occur frequently morbidly obese pregnant woman pregnant woman normal BMI . 2 . We hypothesise severity observe cardiac dysfunction correlate degree obesity . Aims : 1 . To quantify incidence systolic diastolic dysfunction cardiac structural abnormality obese pregnant woman term . 2 . To quantify incidence systolic diastolic dysfunction cardiac structural abnormality healthy term pregnant woman normal BMI . 3 . To quantify severity cardiac dysfunction remodelling obese pregnant woman term . METHODOLOGY Study design : This prospective case control study carry Groote Schuur Maternity Clinic Mowbray Maternity Hospital Cape Town , South Africa . Characteristics study population : We aim recruit 40 obese pregnant , non-labouring woman term fulfil inclusion criterion . As control , 40 healthy non-obese non-labouring term pregnant woman recruit . Controls match age ethnicity . Recruitment : Patients study group control group recruit antenatal clinic antenatal ward . Informed Consent : Written inform consent obtain participant . Forms available English explain participant . The interview conduct participant 's language choice translator assist interpretation require . Data collection : After enrolment study inform consent , study patient control undergo echocardiographic examination describe . Demographic Data : At time point enrolment , follow data record participant accord standard care pregnancy : - age - gestational age parity - ethnicity - height weight - blood pressure Echocardiographic assessment : A full standard echocardiographic assessment accord protocol British Society Echocardiography14 perform experienced investigator ( pass European Echocardiography Examination ) , except subcostal view technically feasible pregnant woman . In addition , detailed right heart examination perform . The examination take place leave lateral position improve image quality prevent obstruction inferior vena cava . A GE echocardiography machine use . For acquisition , 3 cardiac cycle store analysed offline ( examination ) Centricity Electronic Medical Records software develop GE workstation Department Anaesthesia/Cardiology . All echocardiographic assessment offline analysis perform one experienced investigator without blind . Thereafter second experience investigator review image independently offline . Schedule : Data collection plan take place duration 3 month 2016 . Risks Benefits : Transthoracic echocardiography non-invasive procedure safe mother baby . No risk arise due participation study . The timing study interfere routine clinical care . If cardiac condition note examination echocardiographic finding require change plan care , communicate patient 's medical team without delay . Participation study therefore bring additional clinical benefit mother additional risk . Data handle Confidentiality : All demographic data pertain participant collect standardised form . Each participant assign unique study number . The echocardiography data store GE echocardiography machine use number , identify information . From data export hospital base echocardiography data system analysis ( Centricity Electronic Medical Records ) . The participant thus de-linked hospital admission number confidentiality protect . The record access assigned login Groote Schuur hospital available approve user Centricity system . A record hospital admission number maintain correlate echocardiography data clinical data allow patient 's medical team inform relevant pathology may impact patient care . The Principal Investigator access record log information make available outside University Cape Town . Study record identify patient keep confidential required law . Privacy regulation provide safeguard privacy , security authorise access . Except required law , data identify patient study record . The data collect remains intellectual property University Cape Town . Data Analysis : Demographic obstetrics data display mean standard deviation , median interquartile range , number percentage appropriate . Analysis record transthoracic echocardiography variable heart rate blood pressure make use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) General Linear Model significant p value define &lt; 0.05 perform F test collect data . Pearson 's correlation use assess strength linear relationship variable . The null hypothesis reject critical p &lt; 0.05 variable .</detailed_description>
