	<brief_summary>Air pollution continue key global issue many government focus great attention air quality legislation harmful environmental health impact . Whilst much remain unknown mechanism underlie negative health effect air pollution , generally acknowledge air pollution exposure lead increase cardiovascular , cerebrovascular respiratory mortality morbidity . The current study investigate systemic effect 72 hour period control diesel exhaust exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Acute Air Pollution Systemic Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exposure air pollution ( indoor outdoor source ) contribute premature death 7 million people year , primarily link cardiovascular respiratory condition . Within complex mixture air pollution comprises , combustion derive particulate matter ( PM ) suggest one harmful component cardiopulmonary system . In urban area PM derive combustion originates largely diesel vehicle . Numerous experimental chamber study demonstrate respiratory well cardiovascular dysfunction inhalation diesel exhaust . Many dysfunction drive inflammation oxidative stress . There much less knowledge concern systemic effect diesel exhaust exposure , especially long time course 24 hour . The investigator aim investigate time course systemic effect ( marker inflammation , cardiovascular dysfunction , oxidative stress ) blood urine sample take diesel exhaust exposure . The effect exercise rest experimental chamber exposure also investigate .</detailed_description>
