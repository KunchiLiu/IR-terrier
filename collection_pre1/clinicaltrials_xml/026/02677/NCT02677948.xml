	<brief_summary>This study combine two drug treatment relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) . Investigators propose combine ibrutinib , orally-administered , small molecule inhibitor Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( FDA approve treatment relapsed/refractory CLL ) , pacritinib , novel JAK2-FLT3 inhibitor show activity relapse lymphoma , include CLL/SLL . Investigators first demonstrate safety tolerability Pacritinib combine Ibrutinib phase I study , help establish MTD ( Maximum Tolerated Dose ) Pacritinib combine Ibrutinib . Once optimal dose Pacritinib establish phase I set , phase II evaluation seek establish efficacy combination Pacritinib Ibrutinib . Patients receive continuous treatment progressive disease follow study treatment total 2 year .</brief_summary>
