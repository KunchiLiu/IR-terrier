	<brief_summary>Follicular lymphoma ( FL ) common subtype indolent non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma often diagnose advanced incurable stage . In previous trail , Lymvac-1 , patient treat sequential intratumoral injection low-dose rituximab autologous dendritic cell , combine local radiotherapy site . The aim overcome tumor tolerance . In trial , clinical response correlate strongly systemic anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell response detect blood therapy . The primary aim plan study ( Lymvac-2 ) significantly improve rate immunological clinical response add iv anti-PD-1 antibody ( Pembrolizumab ) relative cohort patient previously treat intranodal immunotherapy without Pembrolizumab ( Lymvac-1 ) . The study include 20 patient untreated relapse FL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Intranodal Immunotherapy ( SIIT ) Combined With Anti-PD1 ( Pembrolizumab ) Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients advance stage follicular lymphoma , untreated relapse eligible study . Staging include PET/CT , CT bone marrow specimen . Lymphoma node must available surgical biopsy , radiation intranodal treatment . Additionally , must evaluable lesion measure systemic effect . The patient undergo leukapheresis collection monocyte culture ex vivo obtain immature dendritic cell ( DC ) . The treatment target single lymphoma node radiation ( single fraction 8 Gy ) , ultrasound-guided injection autologous DCs , low-dose rituximab ( 5 mg ) GM-CSF sc . This sequential intranodal immunotherapy ( SIIT ) repeat three time , target different lymphoma node . Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody ( Pembrolizumab ) give iv cycle SIIT every third week total 11 cycle . Patients evaluate clinical response PET/CT , CT bone marrow analysis . CD8 CD4 T cell response autologous tumor cell measure blood treatment flow cytometry . The primary aim induce systemic clinical response correlate T cell response may prolong time next standard therapy .</detailed_description>
