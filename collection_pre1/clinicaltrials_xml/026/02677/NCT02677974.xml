	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study ass occurrence bleeding , valve-related thromboembolism valve thrombosis On-X Aortic Prosthetic Heart Valve target International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) level 1.8 ( 1.5-2.0 range ) 5-year follow-up period . The objective compare adverse event rate patient subgroup list target 1.8 ( range 1.5 2.0 ) per On-X instruction use rate previous IDE trial ( G050208 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>On-X Aortic Prosthetic Heart Valve Low Dose Warfarin Post Approval Clinical Registry Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective , multicenter , observational single arm study newly-enrolled patient treat On-X Aortic Prosthetic Heart Valve . Assuming 20 % attrition 5 year 40 % enrolled patient high risk home monitoring patient , 510 patient enrol study . Patients standard anticoagulation ( INR 2.5 ( 2.0-3.0 range ) ) least 3 month initiation low dose ( INR 1.8 ( 1.5-2.0 range ) anticoagulation treatment . All center follow common protocol eligible patient enter registry within 1 year receive On-X Aortic Prosthetic Heart Valve . No special diagnostic therapeutic procedure do purpose protocol data collect prospectively patient 5 year . Data consenting patient participate site receive On-X Aortic Prosthetic Heart Valve enter online registry database . Patients recruit postoperatively within 1 year , typically first post-discharge visit 2 6 week also special visit surgeon agree . Low dose therapy begin earlier 3 month postop . Data entry non-randomized , continue sample size requirement meet enrollment registry close . To minimize bias patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion recruit agree participate follow-up entered database . A screen failure log patient agree participate kept enter identify reason decline enrollment . Once entered patient analyzed whole separate group TE risk factor warfarin monitor method . All patient contraindication aspirin prescribed daily 'baby ' aspirin ( 75-100mg ) consistency prior research current society guideline . The primary hypothesis registry confirm result see IDE trial , show use home monitoring anticoagulation clinic INR target 1.8 ( range 1.5 2.0 ) significantly increase patient risk relative current standard practice . The primary analysis compare overall composite event rate follow event : - Thromboembolism ( TE ) - Valve thrombosis ( VT ) - Major bleed Each component event combination TE plus VT examine separately secondary endpoint . The sample size registry calculate following assumption : - Incidence composite outcome estimate via Poisson regression - 1-sided test compare composite outcome reference value - 5 % significance level - 90 % power - Expected overall composite proportion IDE high risk treatment group ( pT ) = 0.0457/patient-year ( ptyr ) - Reference value ( p95 , upper 95 % confidence bound PROACT study ) = 0.0693/ptyr - 800 patient-years follow-up - Anticipated 5 year follow-up per subject - Loss follow-up 5 year 20 % The resulting enrollment target 510 subject , would result approximately 816 patient-years high-risk home-monitoring group . These subject recruit least 15 clinical center 35 center . The sponsor provide secure Part 11 compliant online database entry require preoperative , operative , follow-up adverse event data . All appropriate section registry must fill accurately completely . To protect patient confidentiality , sponsor use information registry statistical purpose related hypothesis trial routinely collect source document medical record , record may collect de-identified , i.e . adjudication adverse event . The statistical plan provide section follow generally AATS/STS guidance reference FDA international standard contain preferred method analyze heart valve study data . As primary secondary endpoint study exclusively adverse event method use analyze endpoint specifically use adverse event . The objective performance criterion generally use premarket study use post-approval study preference comparison rate calculate within AVR control arm prior IDE trial ( G050208 ) . The cohort analyze whole subgroup base INR monitor method TE risk category TE risk define clinical laboratory criterion G050208 , except history know hypercoagulability acceptable documentation new blood test hypercoagulability require . Confounding factor examine include age implant ( 50 , 50-65 inclusive , 65 ) , gender , preoperative NYHA classification , occurrence concomitant prior cardiac surgery ( include stent placement ) valve size ( 21 less , 23 ) . Early event present simple percentage . In study early event present three category : first standard 30-day postop date discharge ( whichever longer ) category , second 3-month prior eligibility home monitoring category third period prior enrollment ( 1 year depend upon patient ) . Late event determine time shift low INR possible time initiation home monitoring do . Late event analysis conduct two method : linearize rate ( cover total independent event ) Kaplan-Meier life table ( cover time first event ) . A steering committee registry shall include least 4 member least 2 cardiac surgeon , 1 cardiologist 1 statistician . The committee shall provide input study conduct change study design , data element require statistical procedure use analysis . They shall also review publication arises registry . The member identify prior commence enrollment registry . The committee also either act appoint separate clinical event committee ( CEC ) consist least 2 experienced clinical investigator participate registry . CEC member may member steer committee may also addition steer committee . Both steer committee CEC operate establish charter quality assurance . The anticipated us data collect FDA regulatory review part post approval study requirement publication aggregate data peer review meeting journal . It expect registry fully enrol within 1 year last site enrol follow-up limited 5 year per patient . Once fully enrol registry close entry patient .</detailed_description>
