	<brief_summary>This study consist two clinical series . With first series investigator monitor heal skin graft bioimpedance measurement . The bioimpedance measurement do purpose build patch electrode contact wound reference electrode . In second series investigator monitor close operational wound ( breast reconstruction surgery patient ) bioimpedance measurement . This series also conduct bioimpedance measurement wound operational wound . Both group 20 patient .</brief_summary>
