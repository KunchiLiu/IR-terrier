	<brief_summary>Calcific tendinitis shoulder common enthesopathy , characterize inflammation around calcium hydroxyapatite crystal deposit , usually locate supraspinatus tendon , near insertion place.1 The disease mainly affect individual 30 50 year age , painful 50 % patient frequently lead considerable restriction motion.2,3 It go three distinct stage : precalcific stage ( metaplasia matrix ) , calcific stage ( calcification matrix resorption calific deposit ) , postcalcific stage ( reconstitution matrix ) . Classifications calcific tendinitis propose previously . Gartner propose classification base plain film shoulder : type I deposit sharply outline densely structure . Type III deposit cloudy outline transparent structure . Type II deposit feature both.4 Type III plaques tendency resorb . Due progress musculoskeletal ultrasound past decade , classification calcific tendinitis base ultrasound finding also propose : arc-shaped ( echogenic arc clear shadowing ) , fragment punctate ( least 2 separated echogenic spot plaque without shadow ) , nodular ( echogenic nodule without shadow ) , cystic ( bold echogenic wall anechoic area ) .5 Plaques appear fragment , nodular , cystic ultrasound consider resorptive phase . The treatment patient calcific tendinitis typically conservative . The reported success rate vary 30 85 % .6 If pain become chronic intermittent several month conservative treatment , arthroscopic open procedure available curette calcium deposit , additional subacromial decompression perform necessary.7,8 As alternative , minimally invasive extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( ESWT ) postulate effective treatment option treat calcific tendinopathy shoulder , surgery.9-12 In recent year , radial shock wave develop . A radial shock wave low- medium-energy shock wave pneumatically generate acceleration projectile inside handpiece treatment device transmit radially tip applicator target zone . Radial shock wave show low pressure considerably longer rise time extracorporeal shock wave . In radial shock wave therapy ( RSWT ) , focal point concentrate target zone , occur ESWT , tip applicator . 13 Another new method conservative treatment calcific tendinopathy ultrasound-guided fine-needle repeat puncture calcific plaque , show previous study.14,15 The new method advantage easily operative , cheap , safe , proven high success rate . Although percutaneous needle aspiration large size needle ( â‰¥ 18 # needle ) alleviate symptoms 60 % patient resolve deposit 40 % 74 % ,16,17 large size needle could result tendon injury . In clinical practice , combination radial shock wave therapy ultrasound-guided fine needle repeat puncture frequently use show promise result , however , scientific report rarely publish before.18 The purpose study compare efficacy RSWT , ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture ( USNP ) , combination RSWT USNP treatment calcific tendinitis shoulder .</brief_summary>
