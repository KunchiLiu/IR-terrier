	<brief_summary>During reconstructive surgery involve autologous fat grafting ( AFG -- transplant fatty tissue one part body another ) , fat tissue remove one part body ( usually abdomen leg ) insert another part body . This fat must clean filter ( process ) insert back body . The goal clinical research study compare 3 technique process fatty tissue collect reconstructive surgery . Researchers want compare amount fat process length time need complete AFG technique surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Time Associated With Techniques Process Autologous Fat Grafts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 3 study group . This do one know one study group well , , bad group . You equal chance assign group . - If Group 1 , tissue process REVOLVE™ . In method , tissue wash medical solution spun low speed clean fatty tissue separate fat tissue substance transplant . - If Group 2 , tissue process PureGraft™ . This process use system filter wash fatty tissue medical solution separate unwanted substance transplant . - If Group 3 , tissue process Coleman technique . In process , fatty tissue place centrifuge , machine spin tissue high speed order separate different substance tissue . Once spin do , fat cell collect . Surgery : After assign study group , schedule reconstructive surgery . During surgery , study staff watch surgeon nurse perform surgery . The observer record long surgical team take complete key step surgery . In addition , study staff count number item ( syrinx tube ) use throw away surgery record amount usable tissue produce . After fatty tissue remove , process accord group assign . It place back body reconstructive surgery . If surgeon decides surgery use different AFG technique one assign surgery , still continue part study . Even change take place , AFG process reconstructive surgery perform standard way . Length Participation : Your participation study reconstructive surgery . There follow-up test visit . This investigational study . The REVOLVE™ , PureGraftTM , Coleman techniques FDA approve commercially available . Up 50 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
