	<brief_summary>Composition diversity intestinal microbiota subject influence diet significant impact health gut whole body via complex interaction food constituent , bacteria , host . Polyphenols poorly absorb upper gastrointestinal tract reach colon , may reciprocal relationship microbiota . Because polyphenols mediate gut health reduce risk pathogenesis remain elucidated , propose conduct pilot control feed study examine impact polyphenols constituent free dry whole cranberry powder ( FWCP ) composition diversity gut microbiota , well substantiate bioavailability cranberry polyphenols . The central hypothesis underlie propose research FWCP polyphenols diminish magnitude plant food free diet induced increase Alistipes , Bilophila Bacteroides increase Enterococcus , Bifidobacterium , Eggerthella lenta , Blautia coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group . The propose research novel study examine specific impact FWCP polyphenols incorporate plant food free diet gut microbiota . This propose study innovative positive result demonstrate high degree confidence impact FWCP constituent production beneficial short chain fatty acid , carcinogenic bile acid , atherogenic trimethylamine . The result generate study use plant food free dietary regimen background diet provide definite proof microbial modulating action FWCP , inform mechanism action urinary tract infection ( UTI ) , use formulate message consumer communication gut health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators propose conduct randomize , control feeding , crossover trial 10 adult regular bowel movement ( ≥5 times/wk ) willing consume diet free plant food . The trial include two 5-d intervention phase 2-wk washout period crossover . All meal provide subject intervention phase . Subjects randomly assign receive either Con FWCP diet contain 30 gram match placebo FWCP . The dose select order provide sufficient amount flavonoid PAC comparable average flavonoid PAC intake 157 mg 95 mg/d , respectively US . The plant food free diet formulate contain animal base ingredient . All meal design overseen Helen Rasmussen , PhD , RD , prepare kitchen Metabolic Research Unit . Packed frozen meal provide subject consume home work . Coffee , tea , plant-based beverage allow intervention phase . All subject require provide informed consent prior enrol study . Individuals screen study eligibility accord exclusion criterion , follow : 1 ) antibiotic medication drug know influence fecal microbiota take 3 mo study ; 2 ) active treatment doctor diagnose disease , cancer , cardiovascular disease , gastrointestinal disease ; 3 ) regular use dietary supplement ; 4 ) colonoscopy 2 mo prior enrollment schedule study ; 5 ) value standard blood biochemistry critically abnormal base study physician 's discretion ; 6 ) use ≥14/wk serve alcohol . Subjects meet eligibility criterion value blood biochemistry within normal range ask participate study . During trial , eligible subject require attend 1 screen visit 9 study visit 5-7 wks . At end Visits 2 6 , subject receive randomly assign frozen meal begin consume study meal 5 d. Subjects may consume study meal ≥5 da post-intervention stool sample collect . The whole stool sample place sealed bag cooler ice pack transport MRU within 24 h. Morning spot urine 30 mL fast blood well clinical data collect intervention phase . All collect sample store -80 degree C use . The sample size human trial estimate base effect FWCP plant food free diet induced increase bile tolerant bacteria increase Enterococcus , Bifidobacterium , Eggerthella lenta , Blautia coccoides-Eubacterium rectale . Since data literature illustrate effect FWCP bile tolerant bacteria power calculation , investigator employ propose crossover control feed trial 10 subject test hypothesis . Fecal DNA extract enzymatic digestion bead-beating step follow use QIAamp Stool DNA Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) . 16S rRNA gene amplicons generate extracted DNA use PCR barcoded primer set target V4 variable region . Amplicons sequence Illumina ® MiSeq Sequencer Tufts University Core Facility direct Dr. Anne Kane . Microbiota Analysis perform use Qiime v 1.7 . Operational taxonomic unit generate use UClust . Alpha beta diversity parameter calculate use Qiime . Urinary flavonoid phenolic acid determine routine HPLC-electrochemical detection method . Anthocyanins glucuronidate metabolite urine quantify LC-MS/MS assay investigator use routinely . Fecal short chain fatty acid determine use GC-MS method establish laboratory . The pH value fecal water feces determine use pH meter centrifugation . Individual bile acid feces determine use LC-QTOF-MS method . TMA feces determine use spectrophotometric assay .</detailed_description>
