	<brief_summary>The change heart evaluate course chemotherapy cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMRI ) leave ventricular ( LV ) nuclear scan look left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) . Serial LVEF evaluation detect cardiotoxicity , usually cardiac damage present likely irreversible . Each patient 's sensitivity chemotherapy different . The study do assess ability radiotracer 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 image cell damage apoptosis , cell death , heart effect chemotherapy . This may allow doctor identify patient develop cardiotoxicity future . These patient may benefit change chemotherapy dose alteration change alternative drug .</brief_summary>
