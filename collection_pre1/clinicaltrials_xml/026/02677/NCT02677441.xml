	<brief_summary>This study evaluate non-inferiority conservative management acromioclavicular clavicle disjunction , compare surgical management . Half patient treat specific standardized rehabilitation protocol , half treat coracoclavicular acromioclavicular fixation , follow another specific standardize rehabilitation protocol . Outcomes : The primary outcome non-inferiority conservative management surgical management Rockwood III-V Acute acromioclavicular joint dislocation ( ACJD ) without PICCAT American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons ( ASES score ) one year . If non-inferiority reach , non-inferiority conservative management surgical management Rockwood III-V ACJD PICCAT use ASES score one year evaluate . Secondary outcomes radiological criterion ( i.e . comparison ipsilateral contralateral coracoclavicular distance anterior view ; dynamic posterior shaft cross-body adduction Basamania/Alexander view ) return sport , work absenteeism , complication rate , cosmetic result , patient satisfaction , Constant score , Single Assesment Numeric Evaluation ( SANE ) score , Acromioclavicular Joint Instability ( ACJI ) score , ASES score others timepoints , range motion implicate shoulder . Finally , multivariable regression analysis perform order evaluate impact predictor interest ASES score one year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conservative Surgical Management Rockwood Type III V Acromioclavicular Dislocations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rationale : ACJD either manage conservatively surgically . Concerning functional outcome , usually accept ACJD Rockwood state I II treat conservatively.It still debate whether grade III treat surgically , expert opinion suggest grade IV V well surgical outcome conservative . The main literature fail demonstrate superiority surgical management functional outcome . Despite , operative management result well cosmetic outcome , conservative management associate low duration sick leave less cost . It purpose worldwide expert consensus ( ISAKOS consensus ) dynamic posterior clavicle impaction trapezius muscle ( PICCAT ) could predictive factor poor functional outcome case conservative management . Hypothesis : H0 : ASES score one year follow-up well surgical management conservative management . H1 : one year ASES score conservative management inferior surgical management . H1 first test without PICCAT . If H1 validate , test include patient , PICCAT . Study design : This multicentric case-control study randomize 1:1 conservative surgical treatment ACJD . It non-inferiority trial include 176 patient suffers acute ACJD Rockwood grade III-V. Conservative management consist sling 10 day follow standardized physical therapy program , ( Cote et al . 2010 ) surgical management consist coracoclavicular acromioclavicular fixation specific rehabilitation . Clinical follow-up last one year . Statistical analysis Non-inferiority statistical analysis perform upon appropriate unilateral 95 % confidence interval margin ( Z = -1.645 ) , non-inferiority margin 6.4 , correspond ASES minimal clinically important difference . Analysis plan case `` intention treat '' method , , patient conservative management group undergo surgery unsatisfied , ASES score measure prior surgery instead one year follow-up . No statistical adjustment potential confounders plan . Sample size calculation : ASES score minimal clinically important difference estimate 6.4 . ASES standard deviation surgical management ACJD estimate 9.7 . If truly difference surgical conservative treatment , 80 patient require 90 % sure low limit one-sided 95 % confidence interval ( equivalently 90 % two-sided confidence interval ) non-inferiority limit -6.4 . Mazzoca , one main author ISAKOS consensus ( ISAKOS ) , report operate 50 % Rockwood type III-V ACJD . From , strongly suppose 50 % Rockwood type III-V ACJD present PICCAT . Considering 10 % drop-outs , therefore need 80/ ( 50 % ) *110 % = 176 patient .</detailed_description>
