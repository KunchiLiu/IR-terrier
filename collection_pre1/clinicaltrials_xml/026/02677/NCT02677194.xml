	<brief_title>HeaLED : Pilot Study Skin Healing Under LED Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cutaneous heal physiological process occur many occasion : posttraumatic , post-burn , also postsurgery aesthetic intervention . Most often , topical product use create favorable environment wound heal . LED ( Light Emitting Diode ) light emit diode produce monochromatic non-coherent polychromatic radiation electric current pass . Some LED emit wavelength visible near infrared report promote wound healing . In literature , vitro study show stimulation fibroblast keratinocyte proliferation effect irradiation LED . Animal study also show LED treatment able stimulate healing angiogenesis . Despite existence strong data vitro animal study , clinical data human regard wound healing still poor . Thus , still clear whether LEDs real interest skin healing , , wavelength optimal parameter . Despite , LEDs use widely , unfortunately without clear demonstration effectiveness without determination optimal parameter treatment could guide clinician . The main objective study evaluate efficacy day 3 different parameter LED enhance wound heal dermabrasion CO2 fractional laser mini-zones 10 healthy volunteer . Design study : - screen visit ( day-7 day-21 ) : information patient , verification inclusion criterion , preselection 7 mini-zones , collection inform consent . Clinical examination , vital sign . Pregnancy test woman old enough procreate . - V1 ( inclusion ) : clinical examination , vital sign , new pregnancy test woman old enough procreate , randomization allocation treatment ( LED parameter ) 7 mini-zones 1,5x1,5 cm level forearm , one allocate control ( laser ) . Dermabrasion fractional laser CO2 ablative , evaluation pain every zone VAS post-act . Exposition LED ( 630nm , 830nm 590 nm ) . Water loss measure colorimetry laser exposition LED . Clinical evaluation local tolerance post-laser post-LED + standardize photograph . Application heal cream twice day area treat healing . - V2 ( 24 hour ) : evaluation local tolerance , photo , colorimetry , waterloss measure session LED . - V3 ( 48 hour ) : evaluation local tolerance , photo , colorimetry , waterloss measure session LED - V4 ( 72 hour ) : clinical exam , clinical local tolerance evaluation healing , waterloss measure , colorimetry standardize photo - V5 ( J7 ) : evaluation local tolerance , colorimetry waterloss measure , standardize photo . V6 ( J21+/-3 day ) : clinical exam , clinical local tolerance evaluation healing , waterloss measure , colorimetry standardize photo . Final visit study</detailed_description>
