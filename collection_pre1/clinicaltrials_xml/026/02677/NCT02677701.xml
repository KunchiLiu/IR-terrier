	<brief_title>Testing Effect Adding Chronic Oral Azithromycin Inhaled Tobramycin People With CF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial azithromycin 500mg take orally thrice weekly vs. placebo subject cystic fibrosis chronic airway infection P. aeruginosa utilize chronic inhaled tobramycin therapy . It include approximately 120 subject able complete primary 6-week study phase . Subjects least 12 year old baseline FEV1 25-100 % predict . Subjects continue use clinically prescribe inhaled tobramycin cycle on/off every 4 week . They provide over-encapsulated azithromycin 500mg tablet placebo primary study phase . An optional extension phase offer subject complete primary 6-week study . This 8-week extension phase include initial 4 week without use inhale tobramycin inhaled antibiotic , follow 4-week period inhale tobramycin use . All subject participate extension phase study provide azithromycin 500mg tablet take thrice weekly entire 8-week period . This study investigate use chronic oral azithromycin affect previously demonstrate benefit health use inhaled tobramycin . The primary measurement focus lung function . Additional measurement focus disease-related quality life report subject trial . Exploratory outcome , include measurement safety , also plan .</detailed_description>
