	<brief_summary>Many gynecologic , urologic pelvic reconstructive surgery require accurate way identify open ureter ensure work correctly . Historically , indigo carmine , intravenous medication dye urine blue , use help visualize open ureter cystoscopy camera place inside bladder . In June 2014 , FDA announce current shortage indigo carmine . Thus , investigator need evaluate method assess ureteral patency . Ideal alternative agent low-risk , inexpensive , provide comparable visualization , readily available easy use . Examples agent currently use evaluate ureter , include oral pyridium , IV sodium fluorescein , mannitol . These agent help identify open ureter either dye urine different color pyridium sodium fluorescein , different viscosity urine mannitol . This study compare three method evaluate ureteral patency time cystoscopy compare method : mannitol , sodium fluorescein , pyridium .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Ureteral Patency Post-indigo Carmine Era</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many gynecologic , urologic pelvic reconstructive surgery require accurate intra-operative evaluation ureteral patency . Numerous study show cystoscopy detects great proportion bladder ureteral injury visual inspection alone.The rate ureteral injury gynecologic surgery range 0.6 11 % discover routine intraoperative cystoscopy depend procedure . In review Gilmour et al , incidence bladder injury study perform routine cystoscopy 4-fold high study . Early recognition injury repair primary surgery often result less morbidity patient , successful outcome , increased ease repair . Cystourethroscopy surgical procedure fiberoptic endoscope introduce urethra examine entire lumen urethra bladder disease abnormalities systematic manner.There numerous indication diagnostic cystourethroscopy gynecologic surgery . The important indication rule cystotomy intravesical intraurethral suture mesh placement , verify bilateral ureteral jet ensure patency , evaluate suspect urine leak laparotomy , laparoscopy vaginal surgery . Historically , indigo carmine , indigotindisulfonate sodium use assist cystourethroscopy . Ureteral function assess visualization ureteral efflux blue dye intravenous injection indigo carmine . Indigo carmine many advantage . These include know drug interaction metabolite , easy dose 40mg 5 10 cc 0.8 % solution , change urine non-physiologic blue color ease visualization ability give medication intravenously immediately prior procedure . In patient normal renal function adequate hydration , dye visible approximately ten minute , half-life four five minute . Because large molecular size , largely excrete rather reabsorb . There contraindication use indigo carmine . It use caution patient cardiovascular disease secondary mild pressor effect . The U.S. Food Drug Administration announce current shortage indigotindisulfonate sodium June 2014 . This due inability obtain active agent . There two supplier indigo carmine United States : Akron American Regent . Akron discontinue manufacture indigo carmine plan resume production . American Regent plan continue manufacture indigo carmine base component availability . Methylene blue alternative indigo carmine . Like indigo carmine , give intravenously . However , risk . Methylene blue variably metabolize multiple end product largely metabolized leukomethylene , colorless therefore , may visualize urine . It use pregnant patient glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency risk induce hemolytic anemia . It may also cause methemoglobinemia give high dos great 7mg/kg . Lastly , methylene blue monoamine oxidase inhibitor cause serotonin syndrome patient take serotonergic agent . Given shortage indigo carmine risk associate use methylene blue , investigator need evaluate method assess ureteral patency . Ideal alternative agent low-risk , inexpensive , provide comparable visualization , readily available , easy use . Preoperative oral phenazopyridine intravenous urelle sodium fluorescein agent dye urine . The use safety profile oral phenazopyridine bladder analgesic well establish use single short course . Within one hour ingestion , urine acquire characteristic orange tint . A recent study Hui et al show bilateral ureteral patency bladder mucosal integrity confirm case 124 woman receive oral phenazopyridine prior pelvic surgery . Phenazopyridine safe , inexpensive dye assist effectively confirmation ureteric patency cystoscopy plan pelvic surgery . Consistent literature , pyridium use institution visualization ureter . Some report concern include obscure bladder mucosa strike similarity bloody ureteral efflux pyridium-dyed urine alarm intra-operatively . Doyle et al use sodium fluorescein alternative indigo carmine assess ureteral patency . This study find ten percent sodium fluorescein give intravenously dose range 0.25 1.0 cc result good visualization ureteral jet . Sodium fluorescein injection routinely use retinal angiography use significantly high dos cystoscopy require . They prove safe cost effective . A prospective study measure adverse reaction patient undergo ophthalmic angiography find common reaction nausea ( 2.9 % ) , vomit ( 1.2 % ) flushing rash ( 0.5 % ) .Mannitol low-viscosity , isotonic distend medium commonly use hysteroscopy . As viscosity different urine , may allow good visualization flow urine cystoscopy . It provide excellent visibility endoscopic surgeon also possess property potential impact patient safety . Five percent mannitol typically used transurethral resection hysteroscopy . Excess mannitol absorption know cause hyponatremia ; however , uncommon event . The severity hyponatremia directly relate volume irrigation fluid retain . Absorption great 1000mL typically require cause clinically significant hyponatremia . In study , investigator use 300mL mannitol distend bladder . Therefore , risk hyponatremia minimal .</detailed_description>
