	<brief_title>Mechanisms Non-Invasive Neuromodulation Interventions : Influence Human Neurochemistry Functional Connectivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) non-invasive brain stimulation method effective treat psychiatric non‐psychiatric disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder , obsessive compulsive disorder , pain syndrome improve motor function neurodegenerative disease follow stroke . rTMS use series brief pulse magnetic field apply surface head period time ( e.g . 20 minute ) . The effect rTMS transient , critically dependent upon location , frequency intensity stimulation . Several study provide evidence rTMS influence excitability function neuron ( neuromodulation ) one hour , near , distant , site stimulation . However still unclear transient local distant change function induce specific rTMS protocol mediate . In project combine expertise Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) rTMS neuromodulation develop test protocol examine change produce non-invasive brain stimulation healthy subject . rTMS applied outside scanner use standard TMS coil MRI/S 7 Tesla acquire immediately rTMS . Our aim increase understand two different rTMS protocol , inhibitory ( 1 Hz ) excitatory ( 5 Hz ) , apply primary motor cortex presume dominant hemisphere , affect functional connectivity neurochemistry brain .</detailed_description>
