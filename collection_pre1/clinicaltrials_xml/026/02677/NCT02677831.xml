	<detailed_description>In propose research , investigator plan conduct longitudinal study cohort 5,000+ men woman age 55 year old address issue relate healthy aging . The study population consist community-based middle old age men woman catchment area 7 hospital ( 2 north , 2 middle , 2 south 1 east , half urban half rural ) . In proposed study , investigator recruit subject catchment area 7 hospital expand data collection include interviewer-administered data , physical examination blood urine specimen . In addition , cohort follow annually mortality morbidity re-examined every five year . For newly propose study , order systematically address issue relate healthy aging , specific aim group five inter-related area emphasis ( five component project ) . The five component project : A . Factors may influence physical functioning change old person . B . The benefit healthy lifestyles cardiovascular disease risk profile , quality life physical functioning old person . C. Individual macro-level risk factor cardiovascular disease old person . D. Neuropsychiatric disorder elderly : risk factor impact health . E. Genetic environmental factor frailty/successful age related chronic disease elderly . The propose starting date March , 2008 . The first nine month devote development protocol , manual operation , pilot testing , central training , dress rehearsal . The baseline examination begin November , 2008 last 4 year . The examination consist three part , home visit , clinic examination Heart Rate Variability . The home visit include interviewer-administered questionnaire ( informed consent , contact/follow-up information , sociodemographic data , health condition/medical history , family disease history , physical functioning , geriatric condition , mental health , cognitive function , social health environment , lifestyle quality life , etc . ) physical assessment ( peak flow test , grip strength , physical performance measure ) . It estimate home visit take 2 hour . The clinic examination include urine collection , blood pressure , phlebotomy , Primary Care Evaluation Mental Disorders ( high risk people ) , anthropometric measure ( body height , weight , circumference measure waist hip ) , body composition , visual test , clock draw test , Digit-Symbol Substitution Test , EKG , Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) , Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) , Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) , physical examination , three mobility test ( single leg stance , time go , six-minute walk test ) , brief questionnaire . The clinic examination estimate take approximate 2.5 3 hour . Quality data collection continuously monitor . Two round Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) measurement conduct . During round , HRV measure twice total duration 40 minute . Those installed pacemaker exclude investigator HRV examination . The first round HRV test conduct clinic examination , second round perform one week later . It estimate 60 participant need enrol HRV test , participant need complete four time HRV measurement . This repeated measurement HRV allow u test whether reliability investigator HRV measurement acceptable intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) least 0.6 ( α=0.05 , 1-β=0.8 ) . The HRV test stop least 60 participant enrol Taipei site . The responsible investigator co-investigators experience correspond area research . They collaborate successfully various project many year . During study , investigator meet via conference call face-to-face meeting twice month discuss issue relate examination , quality data , scientific direction , data analysis manuscript preparation . The propose study provide unique opportunity enhance investigator understand cardiovascular disease risk factor profile , physical mental performance functioning , frailty , quality life , morbidity mortality representative cohort old people Taiwan . It provide opportunity ass effect healthy lifestyle prevention chronic illness , disability , quality life old age . This study effect healthy lifestyle middle old age overall health among old person , investigator propose , particular societal relevance give mark growth number older person Taiwanese population , extensive chronic disease-related morbidity , disability , loss independence , large health care cost , mortality . Positive result study inform policy regard allocation resource promote healthy lifestyle age population compress onset morbidity disability , maintain high quality life reduce health care cost .</detailed_description>
