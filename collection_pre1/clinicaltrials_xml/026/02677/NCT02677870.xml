	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Kuvan Amish PKU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) cause deficiency enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . PAH responsible rate limiting step phenylalanine catabolism . This reaction dependent tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) . BH4 catalytic cofactor enzyme PAH . Supplementation synthetic BH4 ( saproterin dihydrochloride KuvanTm ) show activate residual PAH activity lower Phe level certain patient . It may also chaperone effect bind abnormal PAH protein decrease degradation . Saproterin approve oral drug develop reduce blood Phenylalanine ( Phe ) level increase Phe tolerance BH4 responsive patient hyperphenylalaninemia . Certain genotype find good predictor Saproterin responsiveness ; however , correlation imperfect . Therefore standard care perform trial Saproterin therapy ass responsiveness every PAH patient regardless genotype . Currently recommendation include patient two null mutation . The purpose study determine Amish patient PKU show responsiveness high dose , prolong Saproterin trial . The population interest high frequency specific splice site mutation , 1066-11G &gt; A mutation . This splice site mutation lead protein conformational change abrogation function . Previous study genotype indicate &lt; 1 % residual activity PAH enzyme insignificant responsiveness Saproterin . However , specific study Phe level evaluate 24 hour single-dose BH4 challenge standard dose 20mg/kg . Recently , observation several Amish patient suggest promise patient may responsive Saproterin longer trial medication ( Personal comment - Samuel Yang , MD ) . In addition , study evaluate PAH enzyme activity patient , find evidence genotype may need high cofactor concentration optimal enzyme activity therefore may require high dose Saproterin currently recommend 20mg/kg ( 9 ) . To date , formal clinical trial do . To answer question whether genotype responsive Saproterin high dos , prolonged period , investigator propose randomized clinical trial compare blood Phe level patient treat standard-dose Saproterin treat high-dose Saproterin . The result study could reveal new population Saproterin responsive PKU patient . This could call question null mutation PAH gene responsiveness Saproterin . This may lead investigation genotype previously think unresponsive Saproterin . Further , diet treatment alone proven difficult Amish population cultural economic reason . This study include patient three local center potential fourth , state , center participate . All patient enrol University Hospitals Case Medical Center . Consent obtain phone person . - Amish patient University Hospitals Case Western Reserve/Rainbow Babies Children 's Hospital/Center Human Genetics - Amish patient Akron Children 's hospital Akron , Ohio - Amish patient The Center Children Special Needs ( DDC clinic ) , Middlefield , Ohio - Patients Shodair Children 's Hospital Helena , Montana . These patient may recruit patient require meet enrollment goal . Study patient present preferred clinic 5 office visit . Initial testing/Part 1 : length 4 week Recruited patient present clinic part 1 study . After informed consent obtain , molecular genetic testing perform . Testing include sequence analysis PAH gene . This test necessary identify specific genotype present patient . The investigator expect majority population homozygous heterozygous describe splice site mutation . Any patient find one ( ) identifiable mutation sequence include study . Genotypes group analyze separately conclusion study . Patients wish undergo genetic testing include study . Each patient also initial blood Phe level drawn form dry blood spot filter paper card supply test company . All Phe test perform Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment ( CLIA ) certify laboratory The Clinic Special Children Strasburg , PA. Baseline assessment tool ( BRIEF , PKU-QOL ) also perform initial visit . Patients give unique study number investigational drug pharmacy begin part 1 study describe . In part 1 study , patient receive medication . Each patient treat diet alone . Patients maintain stable , Phe restrict diet ( include formula ) consistent diet time enrollment . This monitor food diary keep 3 day week . Specifically , patient expect keep diary 3 consecutive day lead blood draw . Based diary , average weekly Phe intake Phe tolerance calculate record . Patients also complete food frequency tool , review part 1 , 2 3 's initial visit . We use tool , plus allow patient regular access dietician order encourage maintenance stable diet . Blood Phe concentration measure weekly ( Monday ) blood spot card . Patients require weekly clinic visit Phe level draw . Blood spot card perform home mail reference laboratory . In order teach enable patient become comfortable perform blood spot home , nursing staff ( DDC clinic ) travel patient 's house weekly part 1 study ( total 3 home blood spot ) . For part 2 3 study , patient family able , perform blood spot home . Those family remain uncomfortable perform blood spot continue blood spot collect home nursing . Initial visit : - Venous blood draw PAH gene sequence - Baseline Phe level dry blood spot card office - Executive functioning quality life assessment tool ( BRIEF , PKU-QOL ) give - Baseline diet information collect record . Average weekly Phe calculate , Phe tolerance calculate . - Food frequency tool complete review . Blood Phe value Phe tolerance part 1 study ( diet treatment alone ) compare blood Phe value Phe tolerance part 2 3 , low-dose high-dose treatment . Part 2 : length - 4 week Study number randomize `` standard-dose Saproterin '' `` high-dose Saproterin '' group ( treatment group A treatment group B ) . The investigational drug pharmacy provide study patient medication kit , begin treatment period . Goal high-dose Saproterin dose 40mg/kg ( round nearest 500mg ) , provide form pre-packaged 500mg packet powder . Labeled dose packet cover investigational drug pharmacy unidentifiable patient . Standard-dose Saproterin 20mg/kg ( round nearest 100mg ) provide form 100mg tablet . Dosing tablet unidentifiable patient . Medication give orally daily . Initial part 2 visit : 4 week diet period - Food diary collect previous 4 week ( 3 per week ) . Average weekly Phe calculate , Phe tolerance calculate . - Food frequency tool complete review . - Baseline Phe level drawn dry blood spot card office - Executive functioning quality life assessment tool ( BRIEF , PKU-QOL ) give - Provided medication kit ( high standard-dose , 4 week supply ) Final part 2 visit : 4 week treatment - Food diary collect previous 4 week ( 3 per week ) . Average weekly Phe calculate , Phe tolerance calculate . - Executive functioning quality life assessment tool ( BRIEF , PKU-QOL ) give - Empty medication bottles/packet kit collect patient ass compliance - Review potential adverse event This end part 2 . There 2 week `` wash period '' patient receive treatment . The length washout period determine base mean elimination half-life saproterin previous clinical trial . The mean elimination half-life saproterin range 3.9 17 hour . In previous trial , washout period consist 7 30 day . No efficacy assessment perform differentiate support one washout period ( BioMarin Pharmaceuticals , Inc. Data file ) . Based elimination range , determine two week washout period sufficient . Patients maintain steady diet time . Part 3 : length - 4 week The cross-over occur treatment group : A B B A . Initial part 3 visit : 2 week washout period - Food diary collect previous 2 week ( 3 per week ) . Average weekly Phe calculate , Phe tolerance calculate . - Food frequency tool complete review . - Baseline Phe level perform dried blood spot card office - Executive functioning quality life assessment tool ( BRIEF , PKU-QOL ) give - Provided medication kit ( high standard-dose , 4 week supply ) - Review potential adverse event Final part 3 visit : 4 week treatment - Food diary collect previous 4 week ( 3 per week ) - Executive functioning quality life assessment tool ( BRIEF , PKU-QOL ) give - Empty medication bottles/ kit collect patient ass compliance - Review potential adverse event During part , patient maintain stable , Phe restrict diet include formula ( diet part 1 study ) . All Phe level blind researcher access conclusion study . At conclusion study , data analyze , complete list blood Phe level obtain study ( high low-dose treatment ) send patient 's primary metabolic physician . Physicians discuss long term Saproterin treatment patient base Phe level . The study conclude part complete group A B receive trial high standard-dose Saproterin . All medication discontinue time .</detailed_description>
