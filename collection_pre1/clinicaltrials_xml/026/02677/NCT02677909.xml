	<brief_summary>In study , aim conduct pilot test AbStats device . The v2.0 prototype low-profile set sensor fit externally around abdomen embed specialized wireless sensor . The device continuously , safely , comfortably monitor intraabdominal acoustic signal , store data HIPAA compliant software system . We focus trial high-impact inpatient population : ileus surgical critical care unit . We compare device 's signal profile patient ileus vs tolerate feeding without high gastric fee residual . Our study follow specific aim : Specific Aim # 1 : To measure sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV ) , negative predictive value ( NPV ) initiation day ( `` PID 0 '' ) AGIS signal predict PID # 1 feeding failure . Specific Aim # 2 : Among patient tolerate feed PID # 1 , measure sensitivity , specificity , PPV , NPV AGIS predict feeding failure subsequent icu day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computer-Aided , Non-Invasive , Acoustic Gastrointestinal Surveillance ( AGIS ) ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AGIS device consist two acoustic sensor place abdomen `` hear '' segment abdominal cavity . Other sensor configuration possible need . Initial test device conduct UCLA VA-Wadsworth separate IRB approval ; however , time , remain human subject enrol CSMC . We collect AGIS data patient undergoing GI abdominal surgery day surgery throughout inpatient hospital course . We recruit patient already schedule undergo GI abdominal surgery . The AbStats/AGIS system utilized measure analyze bowel sound correlate clinical finding . We exclude subject consent , cognitive inability follow direction , abdominal wall condition disallow topical coverage deem treat physician ( e.g . abdominal wound , advance cellulitis , etc. ) . We obtain consent patient incorporate AGIS device inpatient stay . The technical staff orient device . However , physician member staff available time help position device need . A research coordinator collect clinical data enter data secure spreadsheet . Study team member willcollect follow data patient medical record patient consent study : Age , Sex , Race/Ethnicity , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , Abdominal symptom per chart review , abdominal examination finding per chart review , day ICU , day step monitor unit , day ward , daily vital sign proximity time device worn , include temperature recording , respiratory rate recording , heart rate recording , blood pressure recording , medication usage . Patient data pertain return bowel function abstract , include : date/time bowel sound first record chart , date/time first flatus record chart , date/time first bowel movement record chart , date/time vomit episode , date/time oral diet initiate , amount diet tolerating , need placement nasogastric decompression tube . Patients ask fill diary symptom possible .</detailed_description>
