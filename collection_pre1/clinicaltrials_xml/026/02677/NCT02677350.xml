	<detailed_description>Twenty ( 20 ) subject treat 20 million ( 2 x 10^7 ) allogeneic MSC 's total divide 10 injection 2 million cells/cm tract 0.5 ml volume ( total volume 5 ml per visit ) 4 week interval maximum 4 treatment session base discretion endoscopist time injection.. For patient 6 fistula tract , large tract inject . The first four ( 4 ) subject receive initial injection treat less 5 day apart . As stated response , first four ( 4 ) patient initial safety follow period one month prior proceed treatment patient . Follow : Clinical ( CDAI , PDAI , perianal examination +/- anesthesia ) , endoscopic ultrasound performed time treatment . MRI evaluation perform screening , 4 week fourth treatment ( week 16 ) 16 month , fistula closure achieve . Clinical evaluation perform month 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 . Endoscopic ultrasound MRI also perform need symptomatic patient abscess suspect . Duration Study participation : 17 Months ( Follow-up visit 4 , 7 , 10 16 Months post treatment .
