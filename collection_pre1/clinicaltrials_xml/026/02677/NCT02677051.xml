	<detailed_description>This study double blind randomized treatment trial test sulforaphane improve core symptom autism . It design try replicate previous trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01474993 ) report isothiocyanate , sulforaphane treatment lead improvement multiple metric . Significant improvement see behavior measure Aberrant Behavioral Checklist ( ABC ) Social Responsiveness Scale ( SRS ) . In addition significantly great number participant receive sulforaphane improvement social interaction , abnormal behavior , verbal communication per Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) . In addition The investigator attempt account variability response sulforaphane treatment test allele gene relevant sulforaphane metabolism . The investigator also measure glutathione level , also important sulforaphane metabolism part regulate sulforaphane.. Sulforaphane potent naturally occur inducer mammalian cytoprotective enzyme know . Therapeutic potential base least part ability up-regulate gene responsible alleviation oxidative stress regulate immune system inflammatory response 40 Males autistic disorder randomly select receive either sulforaphane placebo . Seven visit require subject include enrollment , screening , baseline , week 4 , 10 18 follow visit seek 22 .</detailed_description>
