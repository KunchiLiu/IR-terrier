	<criteria>Histologically proven adenocarcinoma prostate . Identifiable prostate cancerrelated osseous metastasis bone scan NaF PET/CT vertebral body , pelvis bone . Such lesion must amenable serial NaF PET/CT image . Preference give subject multiple lesion image one image acquisition session obtain maximal information well location lesion amenable bone biopsy . Patients must start enzalutamide treatment metastatic castrateresistant prostate , cycle 1 day 1 occur within 14 day first baseline NaF PET/CT . Subjects allow receive enzalutamide treatment concurrent study long enzalutamide treatment study prohibit concurrent participation . Men race ethnic group age ≥18 year . The effect NaF develop human fetus unknown . For reason radiopharmaceutical use diagnostic image therapeutic agent image procedure use trial may know teratogenic , men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients must able comply study procedure , include ability willingness lie flat ≥ 30 minute image undergo bone biopsy . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Known bleed diathesis therapeutic anticoagulant ( warfarin , lowmolecular heparin , heparin analogue ) would increase risk complication bone biopsy . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition sodium fluoride F18 ( NaF ) .</criteria>
