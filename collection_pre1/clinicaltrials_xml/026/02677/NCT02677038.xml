On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test biomarker test . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . On Day 15 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 8 week 40 week every 12 week ( Weeks 52 , 64 , 76 , ) , CT scan MRI check status disease . At time study , may test repeat doctor think need safety . The study doctor tell need test repeat . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your active participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : As soon possible last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You core needle biopsy biomarker test . - If disease appear gotten bad , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker testing . If stop study treatment disease gotten bad , continue CT scan MRI every 8 week 40 week every 12 week , disease appear get bad . Follow-Up Visit : About 30 day end-of-treatment visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Long-Term Follow-Up : About 2 month end-of-treatment visit every 2 month study , call study staff ask take anticancer treatment . Each call last 10-15 minute . This investigational study .
