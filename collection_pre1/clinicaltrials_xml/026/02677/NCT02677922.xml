	<brief_summary>This Phase 1b/2 study open-label , randomize , multicenter trial evaluate safety efficacy oral AG-120 + Subcutaneous ( SC ) azacitidine oral AG-221 + SC azacitidine subject newly diagnose AML IDH1 IDH2 mutation , respectively . The study population consist subject candidate receive intensive Inductive chemotherapy ( IC ) . The study comprise Phase 1b dose-finding AG-120 expansion stage Phase 2 randomize stage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Oral AG-120 Plus Subcutaneous Azacitidine Oral AG-221 Plus Subcutaneous Azacitidine Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study redesign expand number patient analyze Phase 1b stage study determine safe effective dose AG-120 administer azacitidine future study . The Phase 1b ( AG-120 expansion ) stage evaluate safety , tolerability , clinical activity oral AG-120 administer Subcutaneous azacitidine . The Phase 2 stage study longer include AG-120 administered azacitidine ( IDH1 subject ) IDH1 patient longer included azacitidine alone arm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy follow criterion enrol study : 1 . Subject ≥ 18 year age time sign informed consent form ( ICF ) . 2 . Subject must understand voluntarily sign ICF prior studyrelated assessments/procedures conduct . 3 . Subject willing able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . 4 . Subject newly diagnose , primary ( ie , de novo ) secondary ( progression MDS myeloproliferative neoplasm [ MPN ] , therapyrelated ) AML accord WHO classification ≥ 20 % leukemic blast bone marrow : Have Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 ( IDH2 ) gene mutation ( R132 , R140 , R172 ) IDH mutational status assess locally ; site without local test capability , referral lab identify . By investigator 's assessment candidate receive intensive Inductive chemotherapy ( IC ) . 5 . Subject Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 . 6 . Subject adequate organ function define : Serum aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( AST/SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT/SGPT ) ≤ 3 x ULN , unless consider due leukemic organ involvement . Serum total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN . Higher level acceptable attribute ineffective erythropoiesis , 3 time upper limit normal Gilbert 's syndrome ( eg , gene mutation UGT1A1 ) , leukemic organ involvement . Serum creatinine &lt; 2 x ULN creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min base Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) : GFR ( mL/min/1.73 m2 ) = 175 × ( Scr ) 1.154 × ( Age ) 0.203 × ( 0.742 female ) × ( 1.212 African American ) 7 .

Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) * may participate , provide meet following condition : Agree practice true abstinence ** sexual intercourse use highly effective contraceptive method ( eg , combine [ contain estrogen progestogen ] progestogen associate inhibition ovulation , oral , injectable , intravaginal , patch , implantable hormonal contraceptive ; bilateral tubal occlusion ; intrauterine device ; intrauterine hormonereleasing system ; male partner sterilization [ note vasectomize partner highly effective birth control method provide partner sole sexual partner FCBP trial participant vasectomize partner receive medical assessment surgical success ] ) screen throughout study , least 4 month follow last study treatment ; Have negative serum βsubunit human chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) pregnancy test ( sensitivity least 25 mIU/mL ) screening ; Have negative serum urine ( investigator 's discretion local regulation ) βhCG pregnancy test ( sensitivity least 25 mIU/mL ) within 72 hour prior start study treatment Treatment Period ( note screen serum pregnancy test use test prior start study treatment Treatment Period perform within 72hour timeframe ) . 9 . Male subject must agree practice true abstinence sexual intercourse agree use highly effective contraceptive method ( describe ) nonpregnant female partner child bear potential screening throughout course study avoid conception partner course study least 4 month follow last study treatment ( 6 month follow last dose azacitidine Canada ) . Furthermore , male subject must agree use condom treat azacitidine least 4 month follow last azacitidine dose . The presence follow exclude subject enrollment : 1 . Subject suspect proven acute promyelocytic leukemia base morphology , immunophenotype , molecular assay , karyotype . 2 . Subject AML secondary chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) . 3 . Subject receive targeted agent Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 ( IDH2 ) mutation . 4 . Subject receive prior systemic anticancer therapy , HSCT , radiotherapy AML . Note : Hydroxyurea allow prior enrollment control peripheral leukemic blast subject leukocytosis . ( however , hydroxyurea give within 72 hour prior administration azacitidine ) . For subject secondary AML ( eg , MDS MPN ) treatment prior cancer exclusionary ; full treatment information collect within CRF . The use trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) suspect APL exclusionary provide discontinue prior initiation treatment protocol . 5 . Subject receive 1 cycle prior treatment azacitidine , subject receive prior treatment decitabine Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Clarification : Subjects newly diagnose Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) currently receive 1st cycle azacitidine ( 7 day ) screen study . On study , Cycle 1 must start 28 day ( +/ 3 day ) initiation prestudy azacitidine . 6 . Subject suspected central nervous system ( CNS ) leukemia . Evaluation cerebrospinal fluid require CNS involvement leukemia suspect screen . 7 . Subject immediate lifethreatening , severe complication leukemia uncontrolled bleeding , pneumonia hypoxia shock , and/or disseminate intravascular coagulation . 8 . Subject significant active cardiac disease within 6 month prior start study treatment , include New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV congestive heart failure ; acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) ; and/or stroke ; leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 40 % echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan obtain within 28 day prior start study treatment . 9 . Subject prior history malignancy , MDS , Myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) , AML , unless subject free disease ≥ 1 year prior start study treatment . However , subject follow history/concurrent condition allow : Basal squamous cell carcinoma skin Carcinoma situ cervix Carcinoma situ breast Incidental histologic find prostate cancer ( T1a T1b use tumor , node , metastasis clinical staging system ) 10 .
