	<brief_title>Neratinib Treating Older Patients With Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate safety tolerability neratinib adult age 60 old locally advanced metastatic HER2 over-expressing breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe full toxicity profile include grade toxicity measure National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4 . II . To estimate rate grade gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicities diarrhea , nausea , vomit . III . To estimate rate dose reduction , delay discontinuation relate study drug . IV . To describe pharmacokinetic parameter neratinib adult 60 old . V. To estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . VI . To estimate event free survival ( EFS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . VII . To evaluate role cancer-specific geriatric assessment tool predict treatment toxicity . VIII . To estimate adherence rate neratinib old adult ( percentage dose neratinib take ) . IX . To explore association pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter geriatric assessment finding . X . To explore serum biomarkers age ( interleukin [ IL ] -6 , C-reactive protein [ CRP ] , D-dimer ) associate treatment toxicity . OUTLINE : Patients receive neratinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
