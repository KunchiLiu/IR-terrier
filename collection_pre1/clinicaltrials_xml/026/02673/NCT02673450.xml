	<brief_title>PER3 Clock Gene Polymorphism , Clock Gene Expression Delirium Intensive Care Unit .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increase number patient treat ICUs worldwide . The majority patient survive critical illness discharge hospital . In recent decade , improved therapy survival ICUs increase focus long term outcomes post-ICU rehabilitation . Both physical mental problem follow admission ICU therapy find year discharge . It therefore important discover factor may significant impact worsen outcome , order prevent treat impairment . Cognitive deficiency may affect large proportion post intensive care population mild cognitive impairment demonstrate 40 % patient evaluate three month discharge . Recovery slow one year follow , 25 % patient still show impairment comparable mild traumatic brain injury . The presence delirium ICU stay associate worsen cognitive outcome 3 12 month follow . Both patient 's global cognition especially executive function impair . Furthermore , long duration delirium period associate poorer cognitive function . Incidence delirium also show association high mortality rate longer hospital stay compare patient without delirium . In previous study , second day admission high incidence delirium . Alterations sleep architecture shallow sleep disruption sleep wake cycle , common ICU patient patient delirium . Sleep deprivation often see delirious patient , consequently , suggest risk factor development delirium . The circadian rhythm inborn cycle biological activity base 24 hour interval , rhythmicity interacts sleep homeostasis order regulate sleep-wake cycle individual . In human , circadian rhythm control suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) ( circadian clock ) mediate melatonin secretion pineal gland regulate sleep-wake cycle . A number factor , especially daylight , influence SCN . When blue light ( 460-480 nm wavelength ) reach retina excites photoreceptors , communicates pineal gland secretion melatonin reduce minimum . Melatonin secrete night blue light absent promotes sleep activation melatonin receptor . Melatonin secretion also interact number body function , include core body temperature cardiac immune system . It one key molecule circadian rhythmicity . The circadian rhythm affect light , also synchronized factor , include shift work , artificial light exposure exercise . A number genetic marker know clock gene play major role circadian control different process body . These gene may determine individual 's chronotype ( morningness/eveningness ) , sensitivity sleep disturbance sleep deprivation , much significance function still unknown . A group gene name PERIOD gene show involved determine individual sleep wake regulation . PERIOD3 ( PER3 ) find three subtypes : PER3 4/4 , PER3 4/5 PER3 5/5 . The number refer variable number tandem repeat polymorphism motif 54 nucleotide repeat 4 5 U . Studies large population show 10 % individual homozygous 5'-variation , 50 % 4'-variation 40 % heterozygous . Patients homozygosity long allele ( PER35/5 ) slow wave sleep long sleep duration compare sub-types . Though difference melatonin cortisol level see , two type react differently sleep deprivation . PER35/5 individual perform poorly variety cognitive test compare PER34/4 . This information might help identify subgroups patient especially sensitive development delirium . A recent study explore relationship PER3 genotype postoperative cognitive dysfunction find association . The distribution PER3 subtypes expect previous study . However , possible association PER 3 genotype cognitive dysfunction never investigate ICU patient . A number gene involve circadian rhythm . These gene express rhythmic manner follow natural light/dark cycle . In healthy subject , severely disturbed expression clock gene Clock , Cry1-2 , Per1-3 , Rorα , Bmal1 , Rev-erb CSNK1ε demonstrate injection endotoxin . In septic ICU patient , desynchronised expression Cry-1 Per-2 demonstrate . This disturbance link secretion proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα ) interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) . The implication disturb circadian rhythm demonstrate associated patient delirium , might future able identify patient higher risk develop delirium - even comatose heavily sedate patient . Something possible current diagnostic method . In study , therefore wish investigate relationship PER3 gene polymorphism incidence delirium . This may help identify patient group high risk develop delirium potentially prevent treat patient earlier stage . The objective identify difference melatonin cyclic gene expression delirious patient , compare critically ill patient . This may new perspective diagnosis delirium heavily sedate patient .</detailed_description>
