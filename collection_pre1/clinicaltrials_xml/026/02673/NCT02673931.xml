	<detailed_description>Patients coronary artery disease ( CAD ) associate atherosclerotic renal cerebral disease make organ especially vulnerable ischemia open heart surgery . At Heart Center Rigshospitalet Copenhagen investigator perform 1000 open heart surgery operation yearly . The primary indication CAD without associate valvular disease . Surgical treatment patient CAD perform coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) off- pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( OPCAB ) . CABG require use extracorporeal circulation , case OPCAB . During extracorporeal circulation heart arrest anticoagulated . Blood expose artificial surface mechanical stress potentially result increase risk systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , arterial embolus organ hypoperfusion potential multi organ failure . The 30-day mortality follow elective CABG 1-2 % , increase 7 % associate valve surgery . The elderly patient reduce renal function concomitant disease 30-day mortality high 20 % . Patients die follow open heart surgery often severe heart failure include cardiogenic shock , occlusion graft native coronary artery , renal failure , stroke/transient ischemic attack severe inflammation prior death . The incidence renal failure require dialysis dependent renal function prior surgery . With elderly patient surgery incidence increase . Renal failure often see conjunction progression heart failure development new onset heart failure . Factors associate brain involvement cardiac surgery macro embolism , systemic hypotension , systemic venous hypertension maldistribution cerebral blood flow . The incidence postoperative cognitive deficit 50 % depend measure . After 12 month figure approximately 30 % . Known factor associate cognitive deficit age duration bypass , however type surgery ( valve insertion ) , temperature , equipment ( oxygenators , filter ) technique de-airing may important . For neuropsychological deficit micro embolism , alter brain flow systemic inflammatory response probably involve . The incidence complication OPCAB unknown , expect slightly low . Many pharmacological intervention test order protect brain surgery vary degree success ( Ketamine vs. Remifentanil , Glucose , insulin , potassium solution ; Platelet activate factor antagonist ; Piracetam ; Lidocaine ; Ramacemide ; Clomethiozole . None make clinical practice . Glucagon-like-peptide-1 agonist - Background Exenatide proven effective reduce infarct size model acute myocardial infarct reperfusion swine . Several animal study clinical study publish demonstrate beneficial effect glucagon-like-peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) analog treatment various degenerative neurological disease . The fact type-2 diabetes show associated development development Alzheimer 's disease Parkinson 's disease lead hypothesis insulin signal impairment could involve disease process . By introduction incretins GLP-1 analog treatment option type-2 diabetes , increase awareness potential role amelioration symptom associate neurodegenerative disease emerge . In fact GLP-1 analog beneficial effect memory formation synaptic plasticity brain animal model , prevent detrimental effect β-amyloid rat model . Clinical study yet prove association human . In addition well know GLP-1 analogs cross blood-brain barrier . Regarding ischemic injury stroke model GLP-1 analog also draw attention . Exenatide ( also know exentide-4 ) infuse focal brain ischemia show reduce infarct volume mouse . In clinical testing human recent randomize clinical study investigate effect Exendin-4 ( Exenatide ) final infarct size myocardial infarction . Patients receive Exenatide tend low final infarct size large salvage index evaluate cardiac magnetic resonance 3 month follow index event . These finding confirm late trial . Importantly investigational drug administer acutely ill patient , receive acute revascularization acute myocardial infarction , increase risk adverse event , excess adverse event include hypoglycemia pancreatitis report . Restrictive vs. liberal oxygen administration wean circulatory by-pass - Background Weaning cardiopulmonary bypass process complete cardiac surgery procedure , , heart stop , function heart lung substitute extracorporeal blood pump oxygenator . After completion surgical procedure heart allow start beating , gradually take function extracorporeal by-pass . Also patient ventilate . During process standard procedure administer 100 % FiO2 weaning process ensure sufficient oxygen supply heart organ . The FiO2 often reduce accord patient need transfer intensive care unit . This study hypothesize FiO2 50 % superior standard FiO2 100 % reduce incidence primary secondary endpoint describe , base follow background data . Preclinical data suggest hyperoxia increase cerebral damage neurological dysfunction follow brain ischemia . Most data originates cardiac arrest model no-flow state induce cerebral injury neurological dysfunction assess . Fairly small randomize controlled trial ( RCT 's ) human find increased level neuron-specific enolase ( NSE ) S-100B patient randomize FiO2=100 % compare FiO2=30 % . Hyperoxia ischemia investigate several setting , final consensus benefit hazard yet establish . In follow term hyperoxia use situation FiO2 increase level 50 % simplicity . Hyperoxia may increase risk develop lung injury ( hyperoxia-induced lung injury - HALI ) , carry high morbidity mortality . However , condition seem require several day extremely high FiO2 significant various ventilation mode may significant impact well . The risk HALI associate short period hyperoxia seem small . Ischemia reperfusion injury investigate small study relation circulatory bypass significant impact magnitude increase biomarkers related cardiac injury accord review . Oxygen administration transport primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) patient ST segment myocardial infarction recently associate increased release creatinine kinasis large final infarct size cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . The impact shorter course oxygen supplement wean circulatory bypass yet investigate . A direct influence hyperoxia increase systemic vascular resistance also suggest , hyperoxia may associate improved tissue oxygenation , clinical effect find remain understood . A recent systematic review metaanalysis suggest risk surgical site infection may reduce hyperoxia . However , large RCT abdominal surgery find increase mortality hyperoxia , particular patient undergo surgery malignancy . In summary , hyperoxia may reduce risk associate surgery regard surgical site infection possibly reperfusion injury , whereas effect overall benefit term mortality may detrimental . Further research need , time equipoise regard benefit hyperoxia wean patient circulatory bypass exit . Most patient require degree oxygen supplement lung ventilate apnea circulatory bypass , hence study pragmatically study restrictive ( FiO2=50 % ) vs. liberal oxygenation strategy ( FiO2=100 % ) Following open heart surgery damage brain , kidneys myocardium frequently see due organ ischemia . Animal experiment well small human study suggest GLP-1 agonist may able reduce ischemic damage . Currently , protective treatment available . A GLP-1 agonist potential protect brain , kidney heart open heart surgery . The treatment easily administer short time large population risk . Thus , large scale randomize study test efficacy GLP-1 agonist placebo conclusively determine patient benefit treatment give pre-operatively . Restrictive vs. liberal oxygenation wean circulatory bypass test clinical trail see equipoise assess net clinical benefit strategy exist . Clinical Hypothesis 1 . A GLP-1 agonist start pre-operatively patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft reduce mortality morbidity due damage heart , brain kidney . 2 . Restrictive oxygenation ( FiO2=50 % ) wean circulatory bypass surgical procedure reduce mortality morbidity due damage heart , brain kidney well reduce significant surgical site infection ( require surgical debridement and/or prolong hospitalization ) compare liberal oxygenation ( FiO2=100 % ) .</detailed_description>
