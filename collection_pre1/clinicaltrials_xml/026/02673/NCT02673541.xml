	<brief_title>Study Lumen- Apposing , Covered , Self-Expanding Metal Stent ( Axios™ ) Versus Multiple Double Pigtail Stents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis ( AP ) responsible nearly quarter million hospital admission annually affect around 40 per 100,000 person per year ( 1 ) . The majority patient experience clinically mild course ; however , many one five patient develop severe illness associate high mortality ( 2 ) . In early phase disease , acute inflammatory process may involve necrosis pancreatic peri-pancreatic tissue ( 3 ) . There also delay complication may develop locally , usually period week , include formation walled-off fluid collection . These sometimes composed simple fluid term pseudocysts , case represent organization encapsulation sterile infect necrosis term walled-off pancreatic necrosis ( WOPN ) ( 4 ) . The indication drain debride collection usually depend upon number factor , principally whether symptomatic , infected , responsible local systemic complication . The contemporary management strategy walled-off pancreatic fluid collection shift recent year . Surgery , even percutaneous catheter drainage , longer consider initial mainstay therapy place endoscopic drainage simple pseudocysts ( 5 ) ( 6 ) . In addition good evidence support endoscopic approach patient infected necrosis ( 7 ) . There numerous publication report success direct endoscopic transmural drainage necrosectomy ( ETD/N ) variety indication include infect sterile walled-off collection ( 8 ) . The issue deserve attention matter select best technique accomplish ETD/N . The current process involve first create cystenterostomy gain access walled-off collection , dilate tract , insert drainage device . However , variety available device method use drainage , knowledge , none date directly compare randomize control trial . The conventional approach involve insert either pair plastic double pigtail stent self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) cystenterostomy : approach limitation , may require multiple endoscopic session definitive resolution ( 9 ) . One , pigtail stent narrow lumen ( 7F-10F ) often migrate become occlude ( 10 ) . Two , SEMS also tendency occlude , cause local trauma bleed infection , migrate , lead also use double pigtail help anchor SEMS place ( 11 ) ( 12 ) . These challenge lead innovation large caliber cover stent flanges either end facilitate apposition cyst wall enteral tissue , prevent migration , allow necrosectomy wide lumen . To knowledge least two designs production ; AXIOS™ stent Nagi stent ( 13 ) ( 14 ) . There fair amount experience , particularly use AXIOS™ stent ( without novel NAVIX access system ) WOPN pseudocysts , majority report show safe effective ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) ( 20 ) . The device also successfully use novel indication include access drainage gallbladder intrathoracic fluid collection ( 21 ) ( 22 ) ( 23 ) . The AXIOS™ stent FDA approve indication drain wall pancreatic necrosis . The present study aim compare clinical efficacy cost effectiveness AXIOS™ stent versus `` conventional '' approach use double pigtail plastic stent treatment patient walled-off pancreatic necrosis .</detailed_description>
