	<brief_summary>Introduction : Patients end stage renal disease expose metabolic hemodynamic complication due disease result dialysis treatment related complication . Uremic toxin due middle molecular weight effectively remove Hemodialysis . Their accumulation lead chronic oxidative stress chronic inflammation state associate increased morbidity mortality . In addition , dialysis session oxidative stress ( OS ) inflammation provoke blood interacts dialyzer . In recent year use Online Hemodiafiltration ( OL- HDF ) enter order enable good uremic toxin clearance . This relatively new method therapy allow large volume blood filtration single dialysis therapy compare standard hemodialysis . It combine diffusion convection clear middle molecular weight substance effectively compare Hemodialysis . This method find reduce rate cardiovascular morbidity mortality among dialysis patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Benefit Ðžn-Line High Convection Volume Hemodiafiltration Treatment Versus High Flow Dialysis Reduction Oxidative Stress Health Related Quality Life Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine whether dialysis high convection volume OL HDF reduce oxidative stress inflammation level , improve hemodynamic stability metabolic complication compare dialysis High Flux ( HF ) membrane . Methods : After rush period 3 month HF membrane , 45 dialysis patient treat HF 6 month convert 6 month OL HDF treatment . The hemodynamic stability measure treatment throughout study Quality life assess reliable valid tool develop adapt specifically ESRD population accord Kidney Disease Quality Life Short Form ( KDQOL- SF ) . We propose measure biomarkers inflammation oxidative stress blood sample collect end period follow ( The number blood sample analyze : 45 patient 3 sample per patient total 135 sample ) . - Total glycated protein relation total protein oncotic pressure sample . We show oncotic pressure serve good measure albumin concentration albumin measure routine clinical laboratories3 . - Albumin detection index4 level albumin , measure oxidation inflammation ( negative acute phase protein ) . - Levels Beta2m . - Levels Klotho : It show reduced serum soluble Klotho associate all-cause mortality , even adjust confound variable , imply level serum soluble Klotho play role predictive indicator overall mortality patient ESRD . - Levels myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) , product neutrophils degranulation due activation dialysis treatment . - Oxidation reduction potential ( ORP ) , global measure oxidant antioxidant activity ( A new instrument introduce research laboratory ) - Advanced oxidation protein product ( AOPP ) , measure total protein oxidation Implication : The study examine whether OL-HDF dialysis high convection volume associate reduction oxidative stress inflammation marker improvement quality life dialysis patient . The result study encourage use new treatment mode order reduce high morbidity result OS inflammation among patient .</detailed_description>
