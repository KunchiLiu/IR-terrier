	<detailed_description>1 . Study overview Prospective , open-label , randomize , multicenter trial test safety efficacy physiology- imaging-guided PCI patient intermediate coronary stenosis . 2 . Primary hypothesis Primary hypothesis FFR-guided strategy show significantly low rate patients-oriented composite outcome 24 month index procedure , compare IVUS-guided strategy patient intermediate coronary stenosis . 3 . Study population 1300 patient derive population Korean China patient stable angina intermediate coronary stenosis coronary angiography receive percutaneous coronary intervention enrol present trial . 4 . Enrollment criterion 1 . Inclusion Criteria - Subject must ≥ 18 year - Subject able verbally confirm understandings risk , benefit treatment alternative receive invasive physiologic image evaluation PCI he/she his/her legally authorize representative provide write informed consent prior study related procedure . - Patients suspect stable angina , regardless result non-invasive test ④ Patients intermediate stenosis non-culprit vessel acute coronary syndrome - De novo coronary lesion major coronary artery ⑥ Intermediate degree stenosis ( 40-70 % stenosis visual estimation ) eligible stent implantation ⑦ Proximal mid segment lesion major coronary artery ⑧ Target vessel size &gt; 2.5mm visual estimation 2 . Exclusion Criteria - The patient know hypersensitivity contraindication follow medication : Heparin , Aspirin , Clopidogrel , Prasugrel , Ticagrelor , Biolimus , Everolimus , Zotarolimus , Contrast medium ( Patients document sensitivity contrast medium effectively premedicated steroid diphenhydramine [ e.g . rash ] may enrol . Those true anaphylaxis prior contrast medium , however , enrol . ) - Culprit vessel acute coronary syndrome exclude . ③ Patients active pathologic bleed - Gastrointestinal genitourinary bleeding within prior 3 month , major surgery within 2 month . - Systemic ( intravenous ) Biolimus , everolimus , zotarolimus use within 12 month . ⑥ Female childbearing potential , unless recent pregnancy test negative , possibly plan become pregnant time enrollment study . - History bleed diathesis , know coagulopathy ( include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ) , refuse blood transfusion ⑧ Non-cardiac co-morbid condition present life expectancy &lt; 1 year may result protocol non-compliance ( per site investigator 's medical judgment ) . ⑨ Target lesion locate coronary arterial bypass graft [ 5 ] Sample size calculation Sample Size Calculation Hypothesis : The FFR-guided strategy show significantly low rate patients-oriented composite outcome 24 month index procedure , compare IVUS-guided strategy patient intermediate coronary stenosis . Based event rate previous trial evaluate FFR-guided PCI strategy ( FAME I 2 year result ) 2 meta-analysis compare IVUS-guided PCI versus angiography-guided PCI strategy6 , predict rate patient-oriented composite outcome ( POCO ) 24 month PCI 15 % 20 % , respectively . • Primary endpoint : patient-oriented composite outcome ( composite all-cause death , MI , repeat revascularization ) 24 month PCI • Design : Equality ( two-sided test ) • Sampling ratio : FFR-guided strategy : IVUS-guided strategy = 1:1 • Type I error ( α ) : two-sided 2.5 % • Accrual time : 2 year • Total time : 4 year ( accrual 2 year + follow-up 2 year ) • Assumption : POCO 15.0 % vs. 20.0 % FFR IVUS-guided strategy , respectively • Statistical power ( 1- β ) : 80 % - Primary statistical method : Kaplan-Meier survival analysis log-rank test - Potential withdrawal rate : total 2 % Based assumption , expect number event 222 . We would need total 1,300 patient ( 650 patient group ) consideration withdrawal rate .</detailed_description>
