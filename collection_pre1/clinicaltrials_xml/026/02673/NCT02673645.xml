	<detailed_description>The University Chicago Education Lab research team carry randomize controlled trial promise academic intervention 2015-16 academic year partnership Chicago Public Schools ( CPS ) SAGA Innovations . Male female CPS student grade 9 10 randomly assign either receive investigator believe best-practice intensive academic support , control group receive status quo CPS community service , one academic year ( AY2015-16 ) . The intervention high-dosage math tutor provide SAGA Innovations ( previously Match Education Boston ) . A previous randomized control trial conduct University Chicago research team find one year intervention , deliver AY2013-14 , generate one two extra year academic growth math , normal U.S. high school student learn one year . The estimated effect math achievement order 0.19 0.30 SD , depend exact test norming use . The effect one-third black-white test score gap math National Assessment Education Progress ( NAEP ) among thirteen-year-olds ( 0.80 SD ) . The intervention also improve student grade math , 0.58 point 1-4 grade scale , compare control mean 1.77 . These gain particularly important math success versus failure strong predictor high school graduation . This current study aim replicate investigator ' previous finding , end research team look academic , behavioral , long-term effect high-dosage math tutor program youth . This study also design explore issue central effort scale-up promising strategy , include variation tutor quality whether optimal tutor-student student-student pairing term gender race . The SAGA Innovations program expand nationally recognize innovation high-dosage , in-school-day tutoring develop Match Education 's charter school Boston . The tutor program meet schedule course , Math Lab , day normal school day , provide addition student 's regular math class . Students take course receive elective credit upon completion . Every student work full-time , professional tutor entirety school year . The content tutor session align student learn regular math course , also target address individual gap math knowledge . Also follow original model develop Match Education , SAGA tutor use frequent internal formative assessment student progress individualize instruction . In addition replicate previous study suggest promise high-dosage tutor model improve academic outcome at-risk youth , study also aim provide insight ability program serve youth much large scale . Despite great need program affect national dropout crisis improve youth outcome , little known take promising education intervention scale . This study begin explore whether trade-off effectiveness scale randomly assign student pairing randomly assign pairing tutor . Tutors separately rank high low quality SAGA leadership , randomly assign tutor student , investigator able explore effect , , tutor quality student outcome . In addition , study look whether gender race composition student-tutor pairing student-student pairing effect outcomes . This work enable investigator begin learn variation tutor effectiveness optimal way match kid tutor . The research team hop work important implication scale promise strategy within Chicago beyond .</detailed_description>
