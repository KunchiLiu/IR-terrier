	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year old . Part 1 : Subjects solid tumor refractory , relapse intolerant standard therapy , standard therapy exists consider investigator inappropriate standard therapy . Part 2 : Subjects histologically confirm , locally advanced refractory TGCT ( include metastatic disease ) deem unresectable orthopedic surgeon similar qualify personnel . Measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior initiation dosing must agree use acceptable method birth control time negative pregnancy test 3 month last dose study drug , Fertile men must also agree use acceptable method birth control study drug 3 month last dose study drug . All associate toxicity previous concurrent cancer therapy must resolve ( ≤ Grade 1 Baseline ) prior study treatment administration . Willingness ability provide write informed consent prior studyrelated procedure comply study requirement . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 02 . Life expectancy ≥ 3 month . Adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal function . Symptomatic brain metastasis . Investigational drug use within 14 day ( 5 halflives , whichever long ) first dose PLX73086 . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy ( exclude skin cancer resection ) , significant traumatic injury within 14 day initiate study drug ( unless wound heal ) anticipation need major surgery study . Active secondary malignancy unless malignancy expect interfere evaluation safety approve Medical Monitor . Examples latter include basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , insitu carcinoma cervix , isolated elevation prostatespecific antigen . Subjects completely treat prior malignancy evidence disease ≥ 2 year eligible . Inability take oral medication significant nausea vomiting , malabsorption , external biliary shunt , significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption . Baseline mean QTcF ≥ 450 msec ( male ) ≥ 470 msec ( female ) Screening . Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia include bradyarrhythmias and/or subject require antiarrhythmic therapy ( exclude beta blocker digoxin ) . Subjects control atrial fibrillation exclude Congenital long QT syndrome subject take concomitant medication know prolong QT interval ( e.g. , tricyclic , azithromycin , methadone ) . History clinically significant cardiac disease congestive heart failure &gt; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 2 . Subjects must unstable angina ( anginal symptom rest ) newonset angina within last 3 month myocardial infarction within past 6 month . Arterial venous thrombotic embolic event cerebrovascular accident ( include transient ischemic attack ) , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism within 6 month start study medication ( except adequately treat catheterrelated venous thrombosis occur 1 month start study medication ) . Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer well inhibitor breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) within 14 day 5 drug halflives , whichever longer , start study drug . Subjects &gt; Grade 1 ( high low ) serum potassium , magnesium , calcium level . Women breastfeed pregnant . Nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . Known HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy . Subjects know active hepatitis B C , chronic hepatitis B C require treatment antiviral therapy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness ( i.e. , active infection ≥ Grade 2 ) concurrent condition , opinion Investigator , would interfere study endpoint subject 's ability participate . The presence medical psychiatric condition , opinion Principal Investigator , make subject inappropriate inclusion study .</criteria>
