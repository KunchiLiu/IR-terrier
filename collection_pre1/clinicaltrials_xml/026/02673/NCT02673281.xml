	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - Study Aim 1 . To assess mechanism underlie biological effect short-term walnut consumption appetite functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) assess neurocognitive function/memory - Study Aim 2 . To investigate effect walnut consumption ( 48g per day 5 day ) appetite satiety analyze molecule regulate energy homeostasis adipokines , well rest metabolic rate measure energy expenditure . - Study Aim 3 . To investigate effect walnut ( 48g per day 5 day ) insulin resistance , lipid , inflammatory marker obesity well effect walnut consume part mixed meal , glucose excursion , insulin secretion excretion gut peptide free fatty acid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Overview : The study short-term , pilot , double-blinded , randomize , cross-over inpatient study test effect either 48 g walnut per day vs. ad libitum diet without walnut appetite satiety , insulin resistance , basal metabolic rate , lipid , adipokines , heart rate , vascular reactivity , marker inflammation . The investigator propose subject stay control environment Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) entire duration arm study ( 5 day ) , separate arm one month long wash period . Walnuts/placebo administration form milkshake identical macronutrient content . Each study subject feed identical diet admission minimize variability . Study Design : Screening : Potential subject initially screen telephone determine eligible inclusion study accord inclusion/exclusion criterion . If pas phone screening ask come CRC screen visit . They detail medical history , physical exam , fast lab test fructosamine , international normalize ratio ( INR ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) , complete blood count ( CBC ) , metabolic panel include glucose lipid profile , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , vitals , anthropometry pregnancy test woman eligible participation sign inform consent study . Subjects meet eligibility criterion randomize start either active intervention placebo . Subjects complete 3-day food diary prior visit 1 document baseline diet . They also meet dietitian advise follow prudent diet maintain stable exercise pattern 2 week first visit visit . Subjects also advise avoid walnuts period . Subjects also require maintain weight +/- 3kg screening study visit . In-patient CRC Admission : In order ensure stable study condition , eligible subject ask stay CRC Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) period 5 day study visit . They receive advice isocaloric diet allow eat ad libitum randomize prior first visit regard sequence study visit . All subject 2 5-day visit CRC , one receive active milkshake contain 48g walnut daily single morning meal instead breakfast , another receive `` placebo '' milkshake without nut . Subjects hunger assess use visual analog scale breakfast , lunch dinner day . These inpatient visit separate 1-month washout period . Subjects investigator blind regard study sequence . For inpatient series , subject admit CRC night first day study . On day 1 , subject baseline measure vitals , anthropometry , brief medical history , physical exam , pregnancy test woman . Prior leave CRC day 5 , subject vitals , blood draw several marker include fructosamine , lipid panel , high sensitivity c-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , adiponectin leptin , rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) , anthropometry body composition measure . On last day , also undergo neurocognitive test fMRI fast state view food cue mixed meal challenge either without walnut . Subjects discharge CRC final testing evaluate milkshake consume day 5 resume normal diet period 4 week time return CRC 5 day second study visit . Prior Visit 2 participant complete another 3-day food diary . If receive placebo milkshake first visit , walnut milkshake second visit vice-versa .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>10 otherwise healthy men woman , 1865 year old , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 30kg/m2 BMI &gt; 27kg/m2 comorbidities would require treatment obesity ( assessed screening questionnaire medical history physical exam examination screen visit ) . Diagnosis diabetes , define per American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) criteria hemoglobin a1c ( Hba1c ) &gt; 7.0 % and/or fast glucose &gt; 125 mg/dL and/or random glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL Subjects medical condition treatment would interfere study outcome would make participation potentially harmful pregnancy breastfeeding , anemia , unstable heart disease , stroke , malabsorption syndrome accord detailed medical history . Present alcoholism drug abuse use medication dose would change plan initiate new medication study period . These condition screen detailed history system review . Individuals nut allergy allergies ingredient milkshake ( walnut , mango , strawberry , banana , berry medley , pineapple juice , safflower oil , walnut flavor ) exclude . Subjects type bioimplant activate mechanical , electronic , magnetic mean ( e.g . cochlear implant , pacemaker , neuron biostimulators , electronic infusion pump , etc . ) Subjects type metallic implant could potentially displace damaged MRI , aneurysm clip , metallic skull plate , surgical implant etc . metal contain tattoo . Anxiety small space and/or claustrophobia Subjects neurological psychiatric problem may interfere complicate testing ( e.g . presence titubation ) Body weight limitation MRI scan table ( 330lbs/150 Kg ) body dimension could difficult performance scan . Subjects adhere experimental protocol reason Uncontrolled infectious disease ( e.g . human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis , chronic infection etc ) Any uncontrolled endocrine condition , e.g . Cushing 's , Acromegaly , etc Any cancer lymphoma Eating disorder like anorexia , bulimia Weight loss surgery gastrectomy</criteria>
