	<detailed_description>Acute appendicitis ( AA ) , common intra-abdominal surgical pathology overall incidence approximately 7 % mortality 0.2-0.8 % . Treatment choice surgical removal inflame appendix use open laparoscopic appendectomy . Until first laparoscopic removal inflame appendix Kurt Semm 1980 , gold standard surgical treatment acute appendicitis remain open appendectomy first describe McBurney 1891 . At begin , LA remain questionable whether benefit procedure outweigh disadvantage . However , since laparoscopic technology advance surgeon ' expertise increase , many surgeon successfully perform multitude laparoscopic procedure AA , continue increase trend use . Eventually , LA prove feasible least safe correspond open procedure , rapidly gain worldwide acceptance . There techniques LA literature gain access describe modern textbook . The traditional approach LA use three port . Over past decade , successful attempt perform procedure few port report include two-port technique , single-port technique , hybrid approach . The two-port appendectomy technique consist one port provide access rigid telescope work channel , second port grasp forceps use retract appendix . In single-port assisted technique , stitch place appendix anterior abdominal wall pull appendix create tension facilitate dissection , appendectomy perform intracorporeally . The hybrid technique form combination open laparoscopic approach . Namely appendix pull one port , traditional open appendectomy perform extracorporeally . The author ' primary objective 1 ) identify simple , safe feasible way perform laparoscopic appendectomy patient uncomplicated acute appendicitis . 2 ) determine health relate quality life patient use Euro Qol ( EQ ) - 5 Dimensions ( 5D ) - 3 Levels ( 3L ) ( EQ-5D-3L ) Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) calculate cost per quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) gain procedure ( LAA TLA ) . 3 ) Purpose surgical algorithm approach acute appendicitis consideration quality health cost . For purpose , case-control study design January 2015 investigate issue .</detailed_description>
