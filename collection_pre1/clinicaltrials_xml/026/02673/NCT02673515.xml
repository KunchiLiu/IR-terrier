	<detailed_description>Intermittent fast dietary regimen define alternate fast `` feeding '' cycle . In addition caloric restriction ( dietary regimen limit daily food intake low one 's daily caloric need ) , intermittent fasting seem activate cell autophagy ( cellular `` recycle '' program ) potentially increase cellular stress resistance remove accumulate molecule potentially toxic . In fact , mouse maintain intermittent fasting without decrease overall food intake show effect body weight reduction equal case even exceed calorie restriction . However , additionally , intermittent fasting combine even high-fat diet feeding period protect mice obesity , hyperinsulinemia , hepatic steatosis , inﬂammation compare control feed ad libitum high-fat diet despite calorie intake , make intermittent fast regimen promise approach reduce morbidity mortality various specie . The best described widely practice version intermittent fast `` alternate day diet '' `` alternate day fast '' ( ADF ) . In animal model , ADF consist ad libitum `` feed day '' alternate 100 % restriction `` fast day '' . However human , often modify allow small amount food consumption `` fast day '' ( e.g . 25 % individual´s energy need ) . Findings recent modify ADF study show significant reduction body weight . However , knowledge molecular effect alternate day diet human metabolism autophagy still scarce since detailed analysis molecular metabolic parameter remain unexplored , especially healthy individual . The overarch aim research project elucidate extent alternate day fasting ( thereby intermittent fasting ) influence human physiology healthy individual short long term . The secondary objective study define novel molecular marker age age-related disease .</detailed_description>
