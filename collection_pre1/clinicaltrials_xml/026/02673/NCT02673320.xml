	<brief_summary>The studied pathology concern post traumatic cervical spinal cord contusion narrow spinal canal . The pathophysiology remain controversial . This pathology enjoy consensus support . Many question remain regard surgical care delay . The purpose study demonstrate non-inferiority early surgical treatment compare surgery perform delay among patient identify cervical spinal cord contusion posttraumatic narrow cervical canal . In current state knowledge practice , treatment post traumatic spinal cord contusion narrow spinal canal spinal decompression perform remote diagnosis . The generally accept delay 15 day . The surgical technique conventional cervical spinal decompression surgery . The type decompression ( anterior posterior ) dependent compression therefore clinical radiological analysis . The choice technique surgical approach therefore leave discretion surgeon . After completion clinical radiological diagnosis post-traumatic spinal cord contusion narrow spinal canal , patient hospitalize intensive care Neurosurgery Service University Hospital concern . After anesthetic consultation determine feasibility surgery absence vital injury involve life-threatening , early surgery within 48 hour diagnosis consider ( accord assign group ) . The surgical technique conventional cervical spinal decompression surgery . Way posterior surgery , laminectomy spinal stenosis significant great equal 3 floor prefer . In case , type surgery discretion surgeon opinion Staff Neurosurgery . The surgical procedure identical two group . Alone , delay surgery varies : le 48 hour first group 15 day second . During different monitor visit ( D0 ( surgery ) , D7 , M3 , Y1 Y2 ) , follow criterion assess : quality quickness motor sensory recovery , early post-operative evolution long medium term evolution also disability functional sequelaes .</brief_summary>
