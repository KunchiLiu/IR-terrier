	<detailed_description>This longitudinal study examine ongoing interaction domain cognitive motor development infant neuromotor disability , well compare difference group infant receive two type intervention . The specific aim study : 1 . To measure change head , trunk pelvis primary orient segment body achievement sit transition crawl infant neuromotor disability . 2 . Describe change problem-solving cognitive ability infant neuromotor disability transition stable sit crawl . 3 . Using eye-tracking technology , quantify evolution focused attention infant neuromotor disability motor skill sit transition crawl emerge . 4 . Compare motor skill , visual attention cognitive change sit crawl emerge group infant neuromotor disability receive two different intervention , determine effect distinctly different paradigm : one focus simply build motor skill , build motor cognition together . This longitudinal study , group comparison determine effectiveness intervention , within group comparison determine change time . Measures occur home baseline , end month 1 intervention , end month 2 , end month 3 , 9 month follow-up visit , total 5 measurement time . Each session take approximately 1 hour time . Because want look child 's movement posture , child clothe either undergarment bathing suit allow view trunk , legs arm 5 measurement session . We video child 's movement posture play two standardized infant test measurement session . The child sit floor independently reach toys move many developmental posture ( crawl , pull stand , move sit ) . The parent always next child measurement session . Children participate one parent-delivered intervention 3-months randomize one two group . Both intervention group parent-delivered intervention , differ goal differ training . Parents train one follow approach : Motor-based problem solve approach body weight support ( BWS ) approach . In approach , parent receive weekly , one-hour session home update train physical therapist advance program individual infant . Thus , total 12 session therapist . Each program individualize two infant exactly skill set . This individualization program standard practice early intervention . Generally , suggestion follow standard developmental guideline , sequence skill present order normal development . Both approach currently use early intervention young child developmental disability , know effective , either approach effective .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Infants diagnosis neuromotor disorder cerebral palsy , birth history developmental history indicative cerebral palsy ( prematurity , intraventricular hemorrhage , periventricular leukomalacia ) select study . The infant Gross Motor Function Classification Scale ( GMFCS ) level I , II , III , infant level IV V would unlikely reach level sit independence enter study . Additional behavioral inclusion criterion : age 9 month 3 year time entry study ; child already independent prop sit ( sit arm support ) least 1 minute , able lift one arm sitting ( place sit ) reach toy place directly front without lose balance blindness , dislocate hip , pending orthopedic neurologic surgery would interrupt time period intervention , additional diagnosis affect neuromuscular system spina bifida . A child would qualify study sit skill mature . Mature sit operationally define : ability sit independently without use arm support five minute without fall ; reach toy use hand without disrupt balance ; move sit position independently .</criteria>
