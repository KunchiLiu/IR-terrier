	<detailed_description>More woman diagnose breast cancer worldwide . While vast majority survive disease , adverse treatment effect common , may persist beyond treatment period contribute burden cancer . After survive breast cancer , woman often struggle upper-body side effect cancer treatment tight scar tissue , arm swelling , decrease shoulder function . This limit woman 's physical well-being , affect ability take care family , return work , ultimately impact quality life . Specific upper-body rehabilitation exercise participation general exercise show prevent , attenuate rehabilitate many physical psychosocial side effect breast cancer treatment . New way deliver rehabilitation need ensure continued capacity undertake grow demand cancer rehabilitation . There currently great diversity quality access cancer rehabilitation . Equal access evidence-based , homogeneous , high-quality rehabilitation need independent geographical area residence set rehabilitation ( municipality hospital ) . Online rehabilitation integrate current survivorship rehabilitation program offer opportunity deliver homogeneous intervention across country . At time , little effort make develop online rehabilitation platform breast cancer survivor , thus evidence support expect benefit online rehabilitation available . Study objective : The study aim test platform feasible acceptable woman early post-surgery month . The hypothesis support film accessible upper-body rehabilitation exercise website promote improve adherence motivation home-based exercise illustrate ≥75 % participant perform home-based program 5-7 time weekly ≥ 75 % participant report somewhat satisfied intervention . Study design : As primary aim study assess feasibility intervention , single-group design chosen . This capture information enrol participant retention , adherence , acceptability intervention test . Outcomes related feasibility intervention collect follow 12-week intervention . Using PICOT format trial parameter : Population : Women underwent surgery breast cancer within last 8 week Intervention : Participants get leaflet upper-body rehabilitation exercise access online rehabilitation platform 12-week study period . The platform website video upper body rehabilitation exercise , mindfulness session instruction lymphatic drainage combine additional information prevention early detection late effect breast cancer treatment . The intervention tailor woman specific upper body exercise base baseline arm assessment . The physiotherapist deliver leaflet exercise educational information support engagement home-based exercise . In addition intervention , participant offer exist rehabilitation program trial site . The program differ site site , generally include post-surgery upper-body rehabilitation group session , general whole body aerobic resistance train individual treatment instruction physiotherapist issue note group session . Comparison : For feasibility study , control group use . Outcome : Outcomes recruitment rate , adherence retention , participant satisfaction , capacity/resources response-rate questionnaire concern intention , attitude , subjective norm , perceive behavioral control home-based exercise , shoulder function . Time intervention : Participants recruit eight week breast cancer surgery , start municipal rehabilitation , inclusion follow 12 week . Study conduct : This study obtain ethical approval Danish National Committee Health Research Ethics , Danish Data Protection Agency submit ethical approval University British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board . The study conduct accordance protocol Helsinki Declaration . All study participant sign inform consent form prior begin study .

Patients eligible offered participate comply inclusion exclusion criterion . Outcomes : Outcomes assess baseline end study . The baseline assessment include standardized questionnaire clinical upper-body assessment . Similar questionnaire complete 12-week follow visit . Primary outcome : The primary objective study determine feasibility acceptability type online rehabilitation breast cancer survivor prior progression full RCT . Feasibility measure use four indicator list . Recruitment rate : All reason ineligibility participant refusal participate record explain change make eligibility criterion future study . Retention Adherence safety intervention : Participants ask record adherence home-based rehabilitation program ( i.e . session per week ) logbook weekly basis return logbook end study . Program-specific outcomes time spend rehabilitation exercise , pain/discomfort follow home-based rehabilitation exercise reason discontinue rehabilitation program include logbook , well participation rehabilitation exercise activity , breast cancer-specific group-based rehabilitation session treatment physiotherapist . Participant adherence home-based exercise prescription calculate proportion week home-based program perform 5 7 time . In addition , participant ' use website track , specifically website track number time duration participant log onto website across 12 week . Participants enrol study fail complete end study assessment record dropout . All dropout contact determine reason non-participation collect suggestion change . If willing , ask complete participant satisfaction questionnaire ( see detail ) . Feasibility define drop &lt; 10 % adherence &gt; 75 % prescribed home-based exercise session determine report perform home-based program 5 7 time weekly weekly logbook . Participant Satisfaction : At end study data describe participant satisfaction collect answer question acceptability . All participant give questionnaire , deliver Easy Research , ask rank various aspect intervention home-based exercise support video , mode delivery , software , etc . `` satisfied '' , `` satisfied '' , `` somewhat satisfied '' `` satisfied '' . Feasibility define &gt; 75 % participant report `` '' `` somewhat satisfied '' intervention . Capacity/ Resources : The amount time spend participant standard upper-body assessment , instruction home-based intervention assistance need use website study period track . We also record additional appointment require teach home-based rehabilitation program assist use website . Secondary outcome : In addition feasibility outcome , aim examine change outcomes interest may occur result participation 12-week intervention . Intention , Attitude , Subjective norm , Perceived behavior control rehabilitation exercise : To answer question motivation , participant ' reaction intervention , intend use , perceive appropriateness rehabilitation exercise answer . Behavioral change motivation home-based rehabilitation exercise measure fundamental adherence . The study method theoretically base framework Theory Planned Behavior validate measure motivation exercise among cancer survivor include breast cancer patient . The Intention , Attitude Subjective Norm Questionnaire 13-item Theory Planned Behavior questionnaire modify use online home-based rehabilitation . Clinical outcome upper-body function : At baseline 12-week intervention , physiotherapist blind prior baseline measurement perform standard upper-body assessment participant . Following measure assess : 1 ) active shoulder mobility flexion external rotation 2 ) upper body muscle strength use Manual Muscle Testing 3 ) arm circumference measure five point along arm use standardize protocol measurement tape 4 ) patient-reported pain tightness measure use 0-10 VAS scale . Ability perform activity daily live : The self-reported QuickDASH ( Disabilities Arm , Shoulder , Hand ) 11-item questionnaire assess arm disability affect multiple arm joint . The QuickDASH administer baseline 12-week follow visit , use ass change arm function study period . Timeline propose sample size : This study first assess feasibility new online rehabilitation platform . The aim start recruitment feasibility study 11 site soon ethical approval obtain . For feasibility study , goal recruit many woman possible eight-week recruitment period . Following 12-week intervention , study expect complete June 2016 .</detailed_description>
