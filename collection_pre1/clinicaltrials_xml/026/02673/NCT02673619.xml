	<brief_summary>Umeclidinium ( UMEC ) potent pan-active long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) . It anticipate topical administration UMEC block stimulation muscarinic receptor , thereby reduce overproduction sweat subject suffer hyperhidrosis . This study assess clinical effect , pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability topically apply UMEC follow daily topical administration , 28 day , palm , subject primary palmar hyperhidrosis . The study also investigate topically apply UMEC , high possible concentration , decrease palmar hyperhidrosis systemic anticholinergic adverse event profile similar observe inhaled administration . This double blind ( Sponsor unblind ) , repeat dose , randomize , parallel group , placebo control study . Study enrol 55 subject .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female subject 18 65 year age inclusive , time signing inform consent may consider enrolment . A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define , Premenopausal females one following : Documented tubal ligation Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion Hysterectomy Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy OR Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) estradiol level consistent menopause ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) 30 day prior first dose study medication 30 day last dose study medication completion followup visit . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . The subject HDSS score 3 4 . The subject diagnosis primary , palmar hyperhidrosis , define excessive , palmar sweat least 6 month duration without apparent cause least one follow characteristic : Positive family history hyperhidrosis Hyperhidrosis bilateral relatively symmetrical First episode hyperhidrosis 25 year age Cessation focal sweating sleep . The subject Baseline/Day 1 gravimetric assessment least 150 mg sweat produce rest , period 5 minute separately palm . ( Measurements repeat two time two different day , screen and/or Baseline/Day 1 visit , subject need qualify least one occasion palm . ) The subject agree avoid use nicotinecontaining product ( include nicotine patch ) treatment period The subject capable give sign informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol The subject unstable life threaten cardiac disease : Myocardial infarction unstable angina last 6 month Unstable life threaten cardiac arrhythmia require intervention last 3 month New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IV heart failure The subject diagnosis Type 1 Type 2 diabetes , receive treatment control blood glucose level . The subject diagnosis hyperthyroidism , confirm thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) , receive treatment hyperthyroidism . The subject diagnosis narrowangle glaucoma , urinary retention , prostatic hypertrophy bladder neck obstruction opinion study Investigator Medical Monitor would prevent use anticholinergic . The subject irritation active infection palm area , include sweat gland . The subject current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone Investigator deem clinically insignificant ) The subject ALT &gt; 2xUpper limit normal ( ULN ) bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) screening . The subject QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) &gt; 450 milli second ( msec ) QTc &gt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . The QTc accord Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) , Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) , and/or another method , machineread manually overread The specific formula use determine eligibility discontinuation individual subject determine prior initiation study . In word , several different formula use calculate QTc individual subject low QTc value use include discontinue subject trial . For purpose data analysis , QTcB , QTcF , another QT correction formula , composite available value QTc use specify Reporting Analysis Plan ( RAP ) . The subject history allergy hypersensitivity anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist ingredient preparation . The subject prior surgical procedure palmar hyperhidrosis . The subject treatment radiofrequency and/or microwave device palmar hyperhidrosis The subject botulinum toxin injection palmar hyperhidrosis last year prior Baseline/Day 1 The subject treatment iontophoresis palmar hyperhidrosis within 4 week prior Baseline/Day 1 The subject use antiperspirant palm within 2 week Baseline/Day 1 The subject menopausal female symptom menopause sweat flush within 3 year Baseline/Day 1 The subject use prohibit medication within indicate washout period The subject test positive follow screening within 3 month first schedule dose study medication : Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) Hepatitis C antibody . The subject positive prestudy drug and/or alcohol test screen The subject positive test Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody screen . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . This apply UMEC subject participate 1.85 % cohort participate 1.15 % cohort The subject exposure four investigational medicinal product within 12 month prior first dose day . The subject condition , judgment Investigator , would put subject unacceptable risk participation study ( e.g. , subject renal failure ) . The subject clinically significant abnormality laboratory value , accord Investigator , would put subject undue risk due study participation . The subject abnormal finding screen ECG deem clinically significant Investigator . The subject pregnant lactating plan become pregnant study .</criteria>
