	<brief_summary>This study aim analyze way human body respond temporary lack oxygen , ischaemia . Prospective participant complete health screen confirm overall health / low cardiovascular risk profile.The participant require pneumatic blood pressure cuff inflation 200mmHg upper arm 5 minute deflate 5 minute repeat cycle inflation deflation 3 time . Blood test vein forearm would take , , do order compare result establish change concentration local circulate compound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Local Circulating Compounds Released Following Blood Pressure Cuff Inflation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence exist short period ischaemia ( lack oxygen deliver tissue body ) protect local remote area body subsequent prolong period serious ischaemia . It show substance release circulation short period ischaemia may cause protection . This study aim identify compound . After participant inform study opportunity ask question , informed consent obtain . Following , modified Exercise Sports Science Australia questionnaire brief medical history obtain . Blood pressure reading , height , weight waist circumference would measure . This establish picture overall general health cardiovascular risk profile . Those meet study eligibility criterion proceed subsequent day blood pressure cuff inflation protocol . Consumption caffeine alcohol consume within 4 hour prior protocol participant must minimise physical activity 4 hour prior protocol . After rest 15 minute arrival , baseline venous blood test take dominant arm . A standard pneumatic blood pressure cuff place around non-dominant upper arm inflate 200mmHg 5 minute . The cuff deflate completely 5 minute . This cycle repeat 3 time , cycle commence soon previous one complete . At end final deflation , second venous blood sample take arm cuff . 10 minute , final venous blood test take dominant arm . Blood sample process store appropriately analysed mass spectrometry . Changes compound cuffed limb opposite limb baseline blood sample analyse .</detailed_description>
