	<brief_summary>This trial study well gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA ligand Glu-urea-Lys ( Ahx ) -HBED-CC ( 68Ga-PSMA ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) work detect prostate cancer may come back patient elevate prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) initial treatment . A rise blood level PSA , protein make prostate , treatment surgery radiation patient without symptom indicate cancer may come back ( recurrence ) . PSA however determine whether disease locate prostate place body . 68Ga-PSMA radioactive tracer target specifically bind tumor cell express PSA make light . PET CT make computerize picture area inside body radioactive substance light . 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT may able see small tumor standard imaging may help determine whether prostate cancer come back body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT detection recurrent prostate cancer initial therapy patient elevate PSA non-contributory bone scintigraphy , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA ligand Glu-urea-Lys ( Ahx ) -HBED-CC intravenously ( IV ) . Beginning 45-60 minute later , patient whole body ( skull base mid-thighs ) PET/CT scan . After completion study procedure , patient follow every 12-24 week 12 month .</detailed_description>
