	<brief_summary>Rationale Aims : Infection dengue virus ( DENV ) cause major morbidity mortality throughout world . In 2012 , estimate 3.6 billion people live area risk DENV infection , include Singapore . The key pathology DENV infection vascular leakage , occur mild case become life-threatening severe case patient may develop dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) dengue shock syndrome ( DSS ) . Mast cell ( MCs ) strongly activate DENV preliminary study show activation level correlate disease severity human patient . Thus , investigator propose use MC stabilize drug , ketotifen , limit immune pathology characteristic dengue infection treat dengue-induced vascular leakage . Methods : The ability Ketotifen reduce vascular leakage DENV patient determine assess pool fluid pleural cavity ( measure MRI CXR ) 5 day drug administration , evaluate percent change compare baseline fluid level . Additional measure vascular leakage immune pathology compare secondary objective . The trial conduct randomized , double-blind study compare response dengue patient give either ketotifen placebo ( n=55 per arm ) . Importance propose research : Currently , target treatment exist limit vascular leakage DENV infection . If Ketotifen identify effective prevent pleural effusion and/or plasma leakage DENV patient , would constitute advance clinical management DENV fever . This finding would also support large-scale trial determine whether Ketotifen use prevent severe vascular leakage occur DHF/DSS . Benefits/Risks : Ketotifen record safety tolerability human , regulatory approval , widespread use . Side effect generally mild . The potential exists , effective , many painful life-threatening symptom DENV infection result plasma leakage would improve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketotifen Treatment Vascular Leakage During Dengue Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 230 million individual infected year dengue virus ( DENV ) Flavivirus spread mosquito vector cause substantial worldwide morbidity mortality . Infection DENV result dengue fever ( DF ) , usually self-limiting illness . However , many individual experience much severe form disease , dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) dengue shock syndrome ( DSS ) , characterize widespread vascular pathology , prominent manifestation plasma leakage lead shock , potentially , death . Currently , treatment DHF/DSS supportive care analgesic , fluid replacement bed rest . Management severe DENV infection typically require prolonged hospitalization accompany careful fluid management . At time , target treatment DF , DHF DSS , make improvement care DENV patient urgent clinical need . In particular , need therapeutic intervention prevent vascular leakage . Animal study suggest drug class mast cell ( MC ) `` stabilizer '' effectively limit vascular leakage mouse model DENV infection . Drugs target MCs use human decade , particularly treatment allergy asthma . One `` MC stabilizer '' , ketotifen , act prevent degranulation MCs . Ketotifen oral drug currently use prevent asthma . It commonly supply form salt fumaric acid , ketotifen fumarate . Ketotifen clinical track record great 30 year safe drug currently approve use Singapore . In formulation also use treat irritation reduce vascular leakage , eye . It MC stabilize agent prevents degranulation MCs , well production additional mediator contain within MC granule , include leukotrienes platelet activate factor . Ketotifen also function antihistamine direct H1-receptor blocking function . The bioavailability oral dose ketotifen human approximately 80-90 % . Drug level peak serum 2-4 hour ingestion . Patients asthma sometimes require treatment ketotifen week prior observe improve asthmatic response , think represent time require chronic inflammation subside time require MC stabilization , occur immediately animal model . The mean elimination half-life ketotifen 12 hour . Side effect include drowsiness , dry mouth , slight dizziness , central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulation weight gain . Patients commonly prescribe 1-2mg tablet , twice day . Treatment DENV-infected mouse MC stabilizer , cromolyn ketotifen , result reduced vascular leakage compare untreated control two separate mouse model DENV infection . These finding apparent use two separate measure vascular leakage endpoint readout : evans blue perfusion , key experimental technique show plasma leakage tissue , hematocrit analysis , clinical parameter commonly use diagnose DHF human patient . This randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled , clinical study ketotifen adult dengue infection . The study conduct outpatient study National University Hospital ( NUH ) Singapore General Hospital ( SGH ) , daily MRIs chest X-rays conduct Clinical Imaging Research Centre ( CIRC ) National University Singapore ( NUS ) . A final visit convalescence ( Day 21 ) site enrolment . One hundred ten ( 110 ) patient randomize 1:1 ketotifen placebo . A baseline MRI pleural cavity , liver , spleen kidney take . Tablets placebo ketotifen self-administered 5 day . Patients give daily clinical exam , Day 1 Day 5 , blood sample collect plasma chymase level , viral load , hematology , clinical chemistry , inflammatory product profile additional laboratory test . After administration final dose drug , blood drawn follow MRI perform CIRC NUS ass fluid accumulation within pleural cavity primary clinical endpoint , assessment liver , spleen kidney experimental endpoint .</detailed_description>
