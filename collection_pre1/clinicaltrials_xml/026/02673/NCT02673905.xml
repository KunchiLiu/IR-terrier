	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate efficacy engineer cartilage transplant ( N-TEC ) comparison cell-activated matrix ( N-CAM ) treatment articular cartilage lesion knee . The main innovation trial use nasal chondrocytes implantation tissue contrast cell seed matrix . The goal trial : ( ) evaluate whether implantation mature graft ( tissue therapy ) beneficial quality durability repair tissue clinical outcome , ( ii ) determine potential mature graft integrate adjacent cartilage form hyaline repair tissue ( iii ) ass efficacy treatment correlation characteristic defect ( e.g . `` acute '' versus `` chronic '' set ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although cartilage damage joint develop mostly old people due degeneration cartilage , also occur regularly young people due accident . Especially large cartilage defect spontaneous self-healing . If defect leave untreated , risk development osteoarthritis later significantly increase . However , current treatment option defect involve difficult operation technique , require tedious rehabilitation limit application large injury availability/quality donor material . Furthermore , often lead entirely satisfactory clinical result due low quality repair tissue . In many case permanent pain restrict mobility persist . Even use new cell therapy lead satisfactory result long term . An innovative promising approach tissue engineering , cartilage manufacture laboratory use body 's cell . First result clinical phase I study show use engineer nasal cartilage regeneration articular cartilage ( knee joint ) feasible safe . In addition preliminary clinical result regard efficacy also promise . The goal phase II clinical study compare efficacy tissue therapy one cell therapy . In order achieve investigator enroll 108 patient study divide two group , one receiving cell therapy tissue therapy . Patients must display symptomatic , isolated cartilage lesion grade III-IV ( accord grade International Cartilage Repair Society ( ICRS ) ) 2 8 cm2 femoral condyle and/or trochlea , 18-65 year old must consent oral write manner order enrol study . After write informed consent obtain , patient test see comply inclusion exclusion criterion . Subsequently blood ( 72ml ) cartilage biopsy ( tissue sample ) nasal septum patient take . The cartilage cell ( Chondrocytes ) isolate tissue , expand 2 week place collagen matrix . For cell therapy result construct culture 2 day allow cell adhere matrix . For tissue therapy construct culture 2 week , allow cell form cartilage tissue . After perform quality test implant release manufacturer base sterility , cell viability case tissue therapy product deposition matrix . Subsequently , construct implant knee . At 6 week well 3 , 12 24 month operation follow-up perform . During follow-ups 12 24 month questionnaire ( KOOS , Euro Quality Life ( EQ ) -5d ) fill patient MRIs perform 3,12 24 month . While questionnaire ( especially Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS-Score ) ) provide subjective information efficacy treatment , MRIs shed light integration implant defect give information quality repair tissue . Retrospectively data analyze correlation status defect time treatment : acute ( symptom since less 2 year ) chronic ( symptom since 2 year ) . This give indication whether one treatment ( cell tissue therapy ) effective define indication ( acute chronic ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient ≥18 ≤65 year old time screen . Patient localize articular cartilage defect femoral condyle and/or trochlea knee . 2 localized cartilage defect accept total defect size ≤ 8 cm2 , cartilage defect locate femoral condyle and/or trochlea cartilage defect treat NCAM NTEC . Patient defect grade 3 4 accord ICRS classification . Patient defect size ≥2 ≤8 cm2 assess MRI/arthroscopy . Patient intact ( ≤ICRS Grade 1 ) articulate joint surface ( `` kiss lesion '' ) . Patient intact meniscus ( maximum 1/3resection ) . Patient stable knee joint sufficiently reconstruct ligament . If , ligament repair do operation within 6 week plan cartilage treatment . Patient maximum baseline score 75/100 KOOS subjective knee evaluation . Patient willing able give write informed consent participate study comply study requirement , include attend followup visit assessment complete postoperative rehabilitation regimen . Patient investigator subinvestigator , research assistant , pharmacist , study coordinator , staff relative thereof directly involve conduct protocol dependency employment sponsor . Patient unable understand patient information Patient unable undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) sensitive gadolinium Patient prior surgical treatment target knee within 12 month use mosaicplasty and/or microfracture ( Note : prior diagnostic arthroscopy debridement lavage acceptable within 12 month ) . Anterior cruciate ligament repair accept , target knee stable primary ACL reconstruction perform within 6 week plan cartilage treatment . Patient onset symptom &gt; 5 year . Patient relevant meniscus tear . Partial meniscal removal allow , exceed 1/3 . Meniscus suture allow parallel , successful , cartilage treatment might add 12 month later . Patient radiologically apparent degenerative joint disease target knee determine Kellgren Lawrence grade &gt; 2 . Patient chronic inflammatory arthritis , and/or infectious arthritis . Patient unstable knee joint insufficiently reconstruct ligament . If ligament repair necessary , repair perform operation within 6 week plan cartilage treatment . Patient malalignment ( valgus varusdeformity ) target knee ≥ 5° . In suspected case , mechanical axis must establish radiographically complete leg image stand a.p . rather p.a . projection . If alignment surgery necessary , surgery perform within 6 week plan cartilage treatment . Patient osteochondral defect ( define bony substance defect &gt; 3mm depth ) . Bone marrow edema allow . Patient relevant bilateral low limb pain . Patient known systemic connective tissue disease . Patient know autoimmune disease . Patient known immunological suppressive disorder take immunosuppressive . Patient currently systemically intraarticularly take steroid and/or use steroid within 30 day prior plan treatment . The patient known history HIV/AIDS . ( Protection staff ) The patient known history Treponema pallidum ( syphilis ) . ( Protection staff ) The patient active hepatitis B C infection verify antigen . Patients cure hepatitis B C infection and/or verify antibody exclude . ( Protection staff ) The patient site surgery active systemic local microbial infection , eczematization inflammable skin alteration ( include protozoosis : Babesiosis , Trypanosomiasis ( e.g . ChagasDisease ) , Leishmaniasis , persistent bacterial infection , Brucellosis , spot typhus fever , Rickettsiosis , Leprosy , Recurrent Fever , Melioidosis Tularaemia ) . Patient known history cancer . Patient known history primary hyperparathyroidism , hyperthyroidism , reduce kidney function , chronic renal failure prior pathological fracture , independent genesis . Patient degenerative muscular neurological condition would interfere evaluation outcome measure include limit Parkinson 's disease , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Patient body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 30 kg/m2 . Patient pregnant , lactate anticipates become pregnant within 24 month surgery . Patient currently participate , participate clinical study within 3 month prior screen visit . Patient known current recent history illicit drug alcohol abuse dependence define continue use alcohol drug despite development social , legal health problem . Patient psychiatric cognitive impairment , opinion investigator , would interfere patient 's ability comply study requirement , e.g. , Alzheimer 's disease . Patient condition , , opinion investigator , would make patient unsuitable study . Patient unable tolerate local anesthesia Any known allergy , especially porcine collagen , penicillin streptomycin Patient unwilling and/or unable give write informed consent participate study comply study requirement , include attend followup visit assessment complete postoperative rehabilitation regimen .
