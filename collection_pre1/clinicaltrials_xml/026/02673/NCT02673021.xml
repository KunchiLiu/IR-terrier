	<brief_title>MARK 1A Series : Percutaneous Microwave Ablation Patients With Lung Tumor ( )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical resection gold standard treatment localize non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , surgery invasive patient surgical candidate , thus provide opportunity percutaneous microwave ablation , primary metastatic disease . Patients deem inoperable typically treat targeted therapy radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , cryoablation stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) , systemic therapy . Percutaneous microwave ablation ( MWA ) alternative option target treatment cancer . Microwave tumor ablation procedure use heat make electric current destroy tumor ( ablation ) . With imaging equipment , ultrasound CT ( compute tomography ) , small incision make skin , tumor locate treated radiofrequency energy . The cell kill microwave ablation typically remove eventually replace fibrosis scar tissue . Patients follow 1 year contrast enhance chest CT , chest PET/CT chest PET/MRI evaluate lesion outcome .</detailed_description>
