	<detailed_description>Lack train sonographers remote community limit access sonography many patient . As result , patient must travel transported secondary tertiary care centre , often delay diagnosis subsequent treatment , create burden patient family , increase healthcare cost . Robotic telesonography , expert remotely performs sonography real time , recently emerge opportunity provide sonography regardless availability skilled operator site . Studies primarily originate Europe demonstrate robotic telesonography abdominal , pelvic , obstetric , cardiologic application adult . However , full potential robotic telesonography across many imaging application yet explore , robotic telesonography yet trialed Canada . This study aim demonstrate feasibility robotic telesonography centre establish sonography service use comparator robotic telesonography . Approximately 30 patient recruit substudy ( obstetric , adult abdominal , pediatric abdominal ) . All patient receive conventional robotic scan crossover design . The sonographer perform scan ask complete data collection form collect information duration exam challenge encounter . Following completion scan , patient-site assistant provide questionnaire patient ( child , parent/guardian patient ) regard his/her experience system . A physician review image generate use either robotic telesonography conventional sonography system report finding standardize report form .</detailed_description>
