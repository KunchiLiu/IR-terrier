	<brief_summary>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) result blockages artery ( blood vessel ) decrease blood flow leg . This may cause difficulty pain walk activity use leg muscle . Exercise may help improve blood flow leg improve ability walk . This research project conduct patient PAD require revascularization . The goal examine effect 3 month exercise rehabilitation neuromuscular stimulation leg blood flow , physical function , quality life general health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-revascularization Rehabilitation Improve Function Veterans With PAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) associate decline physical function impair quality life ( QOL ) nearly 20 % old Veterans result substantial VA health care cost . Revascularization address anatomical pathology , restore mobility function QOL . Optimal therapy may require post-revascularization rehabilitation address linger defect skeletal muscle limit function ; however , current standard care revascularization include rehabilitation . Exercise training neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) may enhance function increase muscle perfusion . Together , two therapy may work complementary manner improve outcome old Veterans PAD revascularization . The investigator enroll Veterans ( 50-80 year age ) PAD plan percutaneous revascularization . Participants complete research test consist : ) Assessment mobility function QOL ; b ) Treadmill test assess ambulatory capacity , calf muscle perfusion ; c ) A gastrocnemius needle biopsy measure capillary density angiogenic growth factor expression . Participants undergo baseline test prior revascularization repeat research test 2-3 week revascularization determine effect revascularization functional outcome . After post-revascularization testing , 52 patient randomize one four group ( Exercise-only , NMES-only , Exercise+NMES , Standard Care ; n=13/group ) . After completion 3-month intervention , participant repeat test determine effect intervention compare standard care .</detailed_description>
