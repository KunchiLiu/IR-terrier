	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well fludeoxyglucose F-18 ( 18F-FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) work predict response chemotherapy patient stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery ( resectable ) . Performing diagnostic procedure , fludeoxyglucose F-18 PET/CT , one course chemotherapy may help doctor predict patient 's response treatment early help plan best treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludeoxyglucose F-18 PET/CT Predicting Response Chemotherapy Patients With Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether percent change maximum standardized uptake value ( SUVmax ) FDG-PET/CT T0 T1 measure mediastinal lymph node predict mediastinal downstaging patient stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate predictive accuracy mediastinal downstaging two FDG-PET/CT-based marker measure mediastinal lymph node : SUVmax T1 change SUVmax T0 T1 . II . To evaluate predictive accuracy mediastinal downstaging FDG-PET/CT-based marker measure primary tumor , include percent change peak standardize uptake value ( SUVpeak ) ( base PET Response Criteria Solid Tumors [ PERCIST ] criterion ) , total lesion glycolysis ( TLG ) metabolic tumor volume ( MTV ) T0 T1 . III . To evaluate whether percent change SUVmax FDG-PET/CT T0 T1 measure mediastinal lymph node predict overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F-18 PET/CT baseline course 1 chemotherapy . Patients undergo 1 3 chemotherapy regimen discretion investigator . CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN 1 : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 . Patients also receive cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN 2 : Patients receive docetaxel IV 60 minute cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN 3 : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
