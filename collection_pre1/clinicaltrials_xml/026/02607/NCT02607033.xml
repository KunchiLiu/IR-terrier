	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) affect estimate 12 -15 million adult US estimate 20 % old Veterans . Those PAD ambulate slow gait experience decrease leg strength , dysmobility , reduce quality life , serious morbidity often premature death . It estimate 60 % individual PAD overweight obese . While PAD worsen mobility , obesity add functional burden older adult PAD . Individuals diagnose PAD , also obese typically claudicate 40 % quickly non-obese individual take 20 % long recover claudication . Studies older obese adult without PAD demonstrate combination exercise weight loss effective improve physical function body composition exercise alone . While finding likely translate old adult PAD , hypothesis yet test . This study design determine whether weight loss exercise ( WL+EX ) versus exercise ( EX ) alone 1 ) improve mobility function ( walk ability ) great extent exercise alone 2 ) determine mechanism underlying change mobility function measure muscle microvascular perfusion composition . The investigator hypothesize combine intervention weight loss exercise ( aerobic restive ) result great improvement mobility function improve muscle perfusion reduce muscle fat infiltration exercise alone obese Veterans PAD .</detailed_description>
