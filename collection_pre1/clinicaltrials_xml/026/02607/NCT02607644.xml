	<brief_summary>Introduction : The laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) use primary airway paramedic Singapore Civil Defense Force 's Emergency Ambulance Service ( SCDF 's EAS ) management out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , endotracheal intubation require skilled experienced personnel , local paramedic train level skill competency . However , self-reported insertion success rate paramedic field currently 50-87 % . Devices like laryngeal tube show higher placement success rate fewer complication . Aim : Investigators aim evaluate efficacy safety new device , Laryngeal Tube ( LT ) , compare LMA . They hypothesize LT superior LMA term placement success rate paramedics SCDF 's EAS , associate few adverse event . Methodology : Investigators propose conduct prospective , longitudinal multi-centre randomize trial compare LMA LT patient cardiac arrest ( medical traumatic ) manage SCDF EAS . The trial recruit 875 eligible patient present SCDF irrespective destination hospital period 1 year detect expect 15 % difference placement success rate . Currently LMA use standard care SCDF 's EAS patient cardiac arrest . Results : Besides primary outcome , secondary outcome dislodgment rate , time placement , number attempt adverse event analyze useful guiding future SCDF cardiac arrest protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endotracheal intubation ( ETI ) consider gold standard airway management definitive airway provide ventilation prevention aspiration patient unable protect airway . However , use skilled , experienced personnel difficult pre-hospital setting . It may also result unrecognized oesophageal intubation . Currently ETI recommend Singapore Civil Defence Force ( SCDF ) ambulances MHA ( Medical Advisory Committee ) local paramedic train level skill competency . Furthermore , reduce emphasis early tracheal intubation unless achieve highly skilled individual minimise interruption chest compression accord 2010 resuscitation guideline . In view reason , ETI recommend Ministry Home Affair 's Medical Advisory Committee ( MAC ) . Instead , disposable laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) use primary airway paramedic SCDF 's Emergency Ambulance Service ( EAS ) management medical traumatic cardiac arrest patient approve MAC use adult child . However still complication LMA incomplete seal partial airway obstruction mask misplacement kink . In addition , SCDF 's self-reported success rate LMA 50-87 % .Hence need explore alternative LMA . The American Heart Association ( AHA ) recommend advanced airway adjuncts Laryngeal Tube ( LT ) Oesophageal-tracheal tube ( Combitube ) alternative airway strategy . Other device include pharyngeaotracheal lumen airway oesophageal obdurator airway - oesophageal gastric tube airway ( EOA-EGTA ) . Investigators choose LT alternative adjunct high insertion success rate LMA . It also low complication regurgitation , vomit dislodgement come sizes accommodate paediatric adult . Method use quite simple inserted blindly oropharynx push resistance felt device fully insert denoted marking device . Our long term objective improve exist EAS 's cardiac arrest protocol placement success rate low complication adverse event rate hospital cardiac arrest . The result study review SCDF 's Medical Advisory Committee ( MAC ) . The result also determine choice rescue airway use hospital eg operating theatre , emergency department , endoscopy room . Primary objective : Investigators aim evaluate efficacy Laryngeal Tube ( LT ) primary airway management cardiac arrest patient compare placement success rate LT LMA ( Laryngeal Mask Airway ) Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest manage Singapore Civil Defence Force ambulance Secondary Objective : To compare safety two airway device compare follow outcome : 1 . Number placement attempt require , 2 . Dislodgement rate 3 . Time successful placement airway device . Hypothesis : The LT efficacious LMA primary airway device prehospital management cardiac arrest SCDF 's EAS do paramedic Singapore Civil Defence Force 's Emergency Ambulance Service ( SCDF 's EAS ) . Investigators propose conduct prospective longitudinal multi-centre ( fire station ) randomise study compare laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) laryngeal tube ( LT ) .The trial recruit 875 eligible patient 1 year . They randomise Emergency Ambulance Service ( EAS ) ambulance station manage SCDF two trial group use longitudinal multi-centre randomise trial design . Group 1 use new laryngeal tube ( LT ) protocol 12 month group 2 continue laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) protocol 12 month . Investigators record expertise/experience/training variable paramedic , adjustment make analysis . Singapore General Hospital ( SGH ) submit ethic application Centralised Institutional Review Board ( CIRB ) behalf SCDF recruit case present SCDF , irrespective destination hospital . This SCDF IRB . All enrol patient follow review Emergency Department hospital record medical related adverse effect . The local self-reported LMA insertion success rate 50-87 % , base survey do part large analysis cardiac arrest figure period July 2012 June 2013 . Results European American airway trial involve paramedic report vary LT insertion success rate 100 % . Most cardiac arrest case occur out-of-hospital , conveyed SCDF EAS . Patients give treatment eligibility criterion meet treatment indicate protocol . No write consent seek part routine clinical care . Half 30 SCDF ambulance use LT ( half day train usage ) another half continue LMA 12 month . The treatment ambulance station provide randomise . Stratified randomisation 3 stratum carry . The 1st stratum , 2nd 3rd stratum consist ambulance come fire post equip 1 ambulance , 2 ambulance 3 ambulance respectively . Block randomisation within stratum carry randomise ambulance administer LMA LT . Sample size calculation base test 2 proportion repeat measurement design . Assuming sample size 35 paramedic arm achieve 80 % power detect increase successful insertion rate 0.95 LT arm 10 patient measurement per paramedic , Compound Symmetry covariance structure successful insertion proportion LMA arm 0.800 , correlation observation subject 0.5 , alpha level 0.05 . The number SCDF paramedic estimate 70 , thus expect total sample 700 patient . Assuming dropout rate 20 % , investigator would need enrol total 875 patient . This number patient correspond number patient hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) need intubation expect study period . Frequency table descriptive statistic 95 % confidence interval outcome variable list calculated . Associations treatment group endpoint analyse use t-test/ Mann-Whitney chi-square test odds ratio present applicable . Multivariate logistic regression use adjust relevant covariates analysis primary end point success ( Y/N ) insertion . In control arm , LMA insert per current SCDF protocol . The LMA insert curved portion tube flat side cuff face patient . The patient 's mouth need open head tilt backward ( except suspect neck injury ) . By keep lead edge flat time insertion , direct cuff hard palate maintain constant pressure oropharynx smooth , continuous motion resistance encounter . For intervention arm , LT insert blindly oropharynx push resistance felt device fully insert denoted second black line . The LT two cuff , one distal middle part tube . The cuff simultaneously inflate one syringe . The distal cuff obstructs oesophagus proximal cuff occludes pharynx . In right position , distal aperture face glottis aperture .</detailed_description>
