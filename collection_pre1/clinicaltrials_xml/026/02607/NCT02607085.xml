	<brief_summary>This study evaluate management subject Standard Care ( SOC ) admit Emergency Department ( ED ) hyperkalemia ( potassium value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L ) . Demographics medical history data , include previous ED visit and/or hospital admission hyperkalemia reason current ED admission , record . Subjects receive intervention/treatment hyperkalemia study-related potassium value determine 30 minute , 1 , 2 , 4 hour start treatment . Subjects receive intervention/treatment initial 4-hour period study-related potassium value determine 4 hour baseline potassium measurement . Available data obtain part SOC management include physical examination , vital sign , fluid intake urine output , ECGs , clinical laboratory data , result chest x-rays . Data regard subject 's chief complaint upon admission ED , possible cause subject 's hyperkalemia , admit discharge diagnosis record ; subject 's overall discharge summary also collect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate management subject Standard Care ( SOC ) admit Emergency Department ( ED ) hyperkalemia ( potassium value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L ) . If initial SOC potassium value suspect , second confirmatory SOC sample obtain must ≥ 5.5 mmol/L continue study participation . It acceptable site use point care analyzer obtain SOC potassium ED 's standard practice . Demographics medical history data , include previous ED visit and/or hospital admission hyperkalemia reason current ED admission , record . If baseline study-related potassium value determine prior first intervention/treatment unable obtain , SOC potassium value qualify subject entry study use subject 's baseline . Enrollment subject baseline potassium value &lt; 6.0 mmol/L limit maximum 50 subject . Subjects receive intervention/treatment hyperkalemia ( eg , intravenous [ IV ] calcium , insulin/glucose , beta2-agonists , diuretic , IV bicarbonate , sodium polystyrene sulfonate ( SPS ) , dialysis and/or intervention hyperkalemia ) study-related potassium value draw 30 minute , 1 , 2 , 4 hour start treatment . Subjects receive intervention/treatment initial 4-hour period study-related potassium value draw 4 hour baseline potassium measurement . The timing intervention/treatment collection recordable outcome follow admission ED record , together procedure follow , well dose route administration . In addition concomitant medication collect 14 day prior ED admission continue discharge ED . If subject admit care ( eg , hospital , ICU , observational unit , etc ) , post-ED concomitant medication collection perform 7 day follow admission unit discharge unit , earlier . Recordable outcomes limited pulmonary edema , ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation , pulseless electrical activity arrest , new clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) change ( include limit severe bradycardia , advanced heart block , bundle branch block , tachycardia [ &gt; 100 bpm ] ) , palpitation , hypoglycemia , gastrointestinal-related event ( eg , nausea , vomit , diarrhea ) event deem significant investigator . In addition , recordable outcome require positive-pressure ventilation , central venous access , intubation , chest compression , IV vasopressor , IV vasodilator , IV anti-arrhythmics , IV fluid bolus , and/or emergency dialysis result death collect . Available data obtain part SOC management include physical examination , vital sign , fluid intake urine output , ECGs , clinical laboratory data , result chest x-rays . Data regard subject 's chief complaint upon admission ED , possible cause subject 's hyperkalemia , admit discharge diagnosis record ; subject 's overall discharge summary also collect . As applicable , date time record follow : ED admission , hospital admission , intensive care unit admission , observation unit admission , step admission , regular floor admission , discharge ( admission ) , dialysis , Do Not Resuscitate order , death , event deem significant investigator . If feasible , bill information and/or Diagnosis-Related Group ( DRG ) cod and/or Ambulatory Payment Classifications ( APC ) associate ED visit interventions/treatments collect .</detailed_description>
