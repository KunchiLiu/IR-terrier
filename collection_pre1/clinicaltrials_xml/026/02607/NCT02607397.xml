	<brief_summary>The cost particle therapy ( PT ) considerably high conventional radiotherapy ( RT ) photon . Considering potential dosimetric advantage PT , necessary determine PT cost-effective photon per indication regard quality life , survival , progression free survival . Given lack evidence benefit particle therapy relevant case , investigator propose silico trial investigate extend proton therapy decrease amount irradiate normal tissue , consequently , risk side effect surround normal tissue well risk secondary tumor . Given validate dose-response curve and/or NTCP model , 10 % low mean dose proton therapy normal tissue compare photon therapy result least 20 % low risk side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ROCOCO - Low Grade Glioma - Planning Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients low grade glioma far good prognosis patient high grade glioma . Despite low incidence initial favorable biological behavior , low-grade glioma behave malignant brain tumour lead considerable morbidity mortality especially young patient . Low-grade infiltrate glioma adult include diffuse astrocytoma , oligoastrocytoma oligodendroglioma . With WHO 2007 classification variety within low grade glioma patient group large . With introduction molecular marker like IDH , MGMT , 1p/19q classification glioma 's general matter debate , shifts treatment prognosis . In context , importance molecular marker recognize use design new trial . Because improved determine long term survivor like low grade glioma patient , reduce long term side effect become even relevant . One prominent side effect radiotherapy low grade glioma patient decline neurocognitive function loss memory . This enable patient daily activity cause loss quality life . The hippocampus associate limbic system long know important memory formation pre-clinical model show loss hippocampal stem cell radiation well change architecture function mature neuron . Cognitive outcomes clinical study begin provide evidence cognitive effect associate hippocampal dose cognitive benefit hippocampal spar . With currently develop IMRT technique attempt make low dose hippocampus . Besides hippocampus dose posterior part cerebellum seem influence cognition . Koziol write recently current consensus paper gather diverse view variety important role play cerebellum across range cognitive emotional function . This paper consider cerebellum relation neurocognitive development , language function , work memory , executive function , development cerebellar internal control model reflect upon way well understand cerebellum 's status `` supervise learning machine '' enrich ability understand human function adaptation . This silico planning study compare different treatment ( photon , proton C-ion ) focus normal tissue radiation exposure fix tumor dose , use delineation gross target volume ( GTV ) , clinical target volume ( CTV ) plan target volume ( PTV ) . The comparison base dosimetric parameter normal tissue mean hippocampus dose , etc . In addition , NTCP fix tumor dose expect TCP determine . Cobalt Gy equivalent dos use report proton C-ion dose . In case proton , constant RBE value 1.1 used tumor normal tissue . The RBE C-ions calculate base model use participate center . The GSI in-house treatment planning system use RBE value calculate basis local effect model ( LEM ) . The LEM I ( alpha/beta=2 ) base radial dose distribution charge particle cross cell nucleus , well radiosensitivity repair capacity tissue . The TPSs use UHM also base LEM model . The model use NIRS utilizes fix RBE value dependent depth body , independent dose level tumor type .</detailed_description>
