	<detailed_description>Learning read fundamental skill teach early year elementary school education . Students experience difficulty reading risk long-term struggle academic achievement . In fact , achieve reading proficiency end third grade establish key predictor life success . While number factor contribute read problem , undiagnosed untreated ocular condition may present one possible etiology . To investigator 's knowledge , large scale prospective study evaluate prevalence vision disorder child read difficulty . Previously , Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study perform visual assessment Baltimore area child 6 month 5 year age establish prevalence select ocular disorder pre-school population . Little known type vision problem affect grade school population without read difficulty . There general consensus undiagnosed untreated vision problem may contribute read difficulty , although extent treatment improve reading performance well establish . Although study demonstrate treatment vision problem improve read performance , publication efficacy school-based intervention identify treat vision problem school-age child lack . If successful , school-based intervention could significant impact improve read performance , especially high poverty neighborhood child high risk poor read aptitude limited access eye care service . The primary goal research study determine prevalence vision problem early school age population read difficulty . To adequately address question , investigator administer read vision assessment 400 second third grader participate school within Baltimore City Public School system . In addition , investigator obtain information many child vision problem receive treatment past , , . The investigator also determine school handle refer child felt poor reader order assist planning future intervention . This study conduct two-year period . In first year , investigator conduct baseline vision read assessment participate subject . In second year , investigator conduct follow vision reading assessment child treat eyeglass eye exercise subset subject healthy eye exam . The investigator plan evaluate barrier intervention , possible assist overcome barrier , example replace lost/broken eyeglass . A secondary goal examine impact vision treatment read performance . Children refractive error convergence insufficiency provide treatment free charge . The investigator evaluate impact treatment vision function read performance . In subsequent phase project , investigator also hope learn novel treatment ( e.g . iPads ) impact read performance .</detailed_description>
