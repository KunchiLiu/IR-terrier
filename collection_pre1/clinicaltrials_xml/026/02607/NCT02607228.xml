	<brief_summary>This study consist two phase : Dose Escalation ( Phase 1b ) Dose Expansion ( Phase 2 ) The Dose Escalation phase evaluate safety tolerability GS-5829 single agent combination enzalutamide , well determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) GS-5829 single agent combination enzalutamide participant metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) . The Dose Expansion phase evaluate following : - In group 1 , efficacy GS-5829 single agent participant mCRPC progress receive enzalutamide ( may also receive abiraterone ) - In group 2 , efficacy GS-5829 combine enzalutamide participant mCRPC progressed receiving treatment abiraterone ( may previously receive enzalutamide ) - In group 3 , efficacy GS-5829 combine enzalutamide participant mCRPC Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) progression , radiographic progression , receive treatment enzalutamide ( participant may also previously receive abiraterone )</brief_summary>
