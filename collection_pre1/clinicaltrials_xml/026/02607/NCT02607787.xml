	<brief_summary>The aim study assess feasibility effectiveness home-based walk strengthen intervention physiological , biochemical psychological outcome colo-rectal cancer survivor . The intervention consist 12-week home-based walking strengthen programme colo-rectal cancer survivor post anti-cancer treatment . It aim gradually increase participant physical activity level start achieve recommend level least 150 minute moderate intensity aerobic activity per week strengthen exercise major muscle group least twice per week . As well usual care , intervention group receive weekly telephone call behaviour change interview baseline . Participants recruit Cancer Centre Belfast City Hospital . Assessments take baseline ( 0 week ) , post intervention ( 12 week ) also 3-month follow-up ( 24 week ) . The control group receive assessment time-points however continue receive usual care intervention information ( include pedometer , exercise booklet , diary behavioural change interview ) give 3-month follow-up appointment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The number people live beyond cancer ever increase ever need facilitate appropriate rehabilitation patient . Exercise intervention increase physical activity well document ability improve multiple aspect health cancer survivor ; include quality life , fatigue well all-cause cancer-specific mortality . Whilst main outcome study feasibility , novel aspect analysis biological marker blood . Although much evidence benefit exercise colo-rectal cancer survivor , biological mechanism underlie effect population still elusive . Therefore intervention design investigate feasibility effectiveness home-based walk strengthen programme physiological , biochemical psychological outcome colo-rectal cancer survivor . Participants first approach surgeon/oncologist assessed eligibility . If deem eligible refer researcher wait room give information study . If interested , receive participant information sheet consent form take home period least 24 hour , researcher call confirm interest . Visit 1 schedule order participant sign consent form receive 'ActiGraph ' accelerometer wear 7 consecutive day order measure baseline physical activity level . With permission , patient GP advised letter patient commence study . After seven day participant attends Northern Ireland Clinical Research Facility Belfast City Hospital first assessment session . The outcome measure assess include analysis feasibility , quality life , fatigue , biological marker , anthropometry , strength , cardiovascular endurance physical activity level . The intervention group receive behaviour change counsel session along exercise booklet , diary pedometer . Weekly phone call make intervention participant 12 week monitor progress . The control group receive usual care without weekly phone call . On week 11 group post accelerometer record activity level attend City Hospital repeat assessment . Both group contact week 23 post accelerometer final time follow-up assessment complete . It assessment session control group receive behaviour change session intervention material . After assessment day , blood sample transport via specifically design fridge , Ulster University campus store -80 degree Celsius future analysis . All study information questionnaire collect data store per University protocol storage container designate locked room campus .</detailed_description>
