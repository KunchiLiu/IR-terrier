	<brief_summary>A prospective study design evaluate change tissue cerebral oxygenation follow administration blood patient undergoing spinal surgery . Red blood transfusion ( autologous allogeneic ) indicate improve oxygen delivery tissue hence tissue oxygenation . Despite presumed efficacy , limited data demonstrate change tissue oxygenation administration blood . Furthermore , administration autologous blood cell saver allogeneic blood associate acute long-term deleterious physiologic effect may impact perioperative course . As , data need clearly delineate benefit transfusion perioperative period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Cerebral Oxygenation During Administration Cell Saver Blood Allogeneic Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study include patient present spinal surgery . There change anesthetic perioperative care patient . Per usual clinical routine , cell saver use intraoperatively limit need allogeneic blood . Tissue cerebral oxygenation monitor use near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . The device apply non-invasively like pulse oximetry muscle bed ( usually deltoid ) forehead measure tissue oxygenation . These device use routinely operate room cardiothoracic intensive care unit . Although use every major orthopedic procedure , device routinely use various high risk clinical scenario . As clinically indicate , cell saver blood ( autologous ) allogeneic blood administer . During time , tissue cerebral oxygenation record every 5 minute start 10 minute transfusion continue 30 minute follow transfusion .</detailed_description>
