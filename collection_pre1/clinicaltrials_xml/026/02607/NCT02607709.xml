	<detailed_description>Background : Two three tumour upper urinary tract locate renal pelvis . Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma probably common among tumours upper urinary tract compare tumour urinary bladder . Thus , muscle-invasive tumour represent approximately 45 % renal pelvic tumour compare 25 % tumour within urinary bladder . As bladder , lymph node metastasis rare non-muscle invasive disease . Information regard indication , extent possible curative potential currently lack lymphadenectomy conjunction nephroureterectomy urothelial carcinoma upper urinary tract ( UUTUC ) . There , however , retrospective series survival data patient lymph node metastasis report long term survival surgery monotherapy similar survival proportion bladder cancer lymph node metastases radical cystectomy . A retrospective study Tokyo expand available prospective study , 68 patient UUTUC submit template-based lymphadenectomy . Another retrospective study Japanese group , show 5-year cancer-specific recurrence-free survival significantly high complete lymphadenectomy group incomplete lymphadenectomy without lymphadenectomy group . Tanaka N et al . report recurrence rate nephroureterectomy without lymphadenectomy 1 3 year 18.9 29.8 % , respectively . Hypothesis : Complete lymphadenectomy nephroureterectomy invasive urothelial carcinoma may reduce incidence lymph node metastasis , local recurrence , distant metastasis improve cancer survival rate . Purpose : To evaluate influence complete lymphadenectomy recurrence cancer specific survival rate compare limited lymphadenectomy . Primary endpoint/analysis : Recurrence free survival five-year postoperative . Secondary endpoint : Incidence lymph node metastasis , local recurrence and/or distant metastasis , cancer specific overall survival one , three five-year postoperative . Complications rate accord Clavien classification within first thirty day postoperatively . Another endpoint/analysis : Multivariate analysis possible preoperative risk factor lymph node metastasis ( tumour size , preoperative urinary cytology , lymph node enlargement CT , PET-CT positivity ) postoperative risk factor lymph node metastasis ( stage , grade , tumour diameter , presence necrosis tumour ( none ; &lt; 10 % ; &gt; 10 % total tumour area ) , number lymph node excise ) . Design : Prospectively randomize template base lymphadenectomy , patient clinically muscle-invasive UUTUC renal pelvis upper 2/3 ureter . One one , control clinical trial . Patients randomly allocate two group , 183 patient group . Group A schedule receive routine standard open robot assist nephroureterectomy without lymphadenectomy except clinically enlarge . Group B schedule receive mapped lymphadenectomy conjugation nephroureterectomy .</detailed_description>
