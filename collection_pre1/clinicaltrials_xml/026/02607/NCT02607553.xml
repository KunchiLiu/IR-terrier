	<brief_title>Safety Activity G-202 Patients With Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma That Expresses PSMA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epithelial tumor , include clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , ability grow finite size absence vascularization . RCC characterize highly-vascularized tumor inhibit angiogenesis potential impair tumor growth , include growth RCC . Therapeutic target integral biological pathway RCC , include involve VEGF mTOR , produce robust clinical effect revolutionize treatment metastatic RCC . These approach offer significant clinical benefit sequential use agent become empirical standard care . However , complete durable response uncommon resistance develop median interval 6-15 month . This raise press clinical need additional therapeutic approach patient metastatic clear cell RCC . The purpose study investigate approach target delivery cytotoxic chemotherapy G-202 patient advance , refractory RCC . This study base prodrug tumor targeting , inactive form toxic agent administer systemically get activate specific location body , result high concentration cytotoxic form tumor location . G-202 prodrug activate PSMA blood vessel tumor , normal tissue ; activate , G-202 lead disruption intracellular calcium level subsequent induction apoptosis . Thus , G-202 expect bring cell death RCC destroy blood supply RCC tumor . This single-arm , open-label Phase II clinical trial evaluate safety activity G-202 patient RCC express PSMA .</detailed_description>
