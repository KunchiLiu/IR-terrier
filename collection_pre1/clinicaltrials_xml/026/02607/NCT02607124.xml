	<brief_summary>In research study investigator want learn effect , good bad , study drug Ribociclib give radiation therapy . The investigator ask people research study newly diagnose high grade glioma , tumor screen Rb1 protein , recently finish radiation therapy . Patients DIPG Bi-thalamic high grade glioma need tumor tissue screen Rb1 protein need finish radiation therapy . Tumor cell grow divide quickly . In normal cell , protein call cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK 4 6 ) control cell division . Another protein Rb1 also control cell division work stop cell divide become cancer cell . But cancer , CDK 4 6 protein control make cell divide grow quickly . The study drug , ribociclib stop CDK 4 6 protein . When CDK 4 6 protein stop , normal Rb1 protein work slow cell growth . For patient HGG , study tumor tissue must normal Rb1 protein . The researcher think study drug give soon radiation therapy , may help improve effect radiation stop tumor grow . The study drug , Ribociclib consider investigational yet approve United States Food Drug Administration . The study drug test child adult cancer prior research study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Ribociclib , CDK4/6 Inhibitor , Following Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ribociclib show acceptable toxicity profile adult pediatrics . Available data suggest 70 % DIPG patient intact RB 90 % HGG patient expression RB , therefore CDK4/6 inhibition suitable target . Given dismal prognosis child DIPG HGG , appropriate evaluate long term feasibility early efficacy Ribociclib follow radiation therapy patient RB+ tumor . The aim upfront biopsy molecular study propose identify subgroup patient benefit use checkpoint inhibitor set intact RB pathway . This study play major role move field DIPG/HGG research forward investigator intend reveal feasibility upfront stereotactic biopsy specific pathway directed therapy follow radiation therapy ultimate goal add additional target therapy combination Ribociclib result improve outcome patient diagnose fatal tumor . The current proposal novel pediatric study obtain biopsy DIPG prior therapy administer molecularly target therapy follow radiation therapy child newly diagnose DIPG HGG . In study , investigator assess assess long-term feasibility early efficacy Ribociclib administer daily 3 week one week every 28 day follow radiation therapy least 6 course 12 course patient newly-diagnosed non-biopsied DIPG RB+ biopsied DIPG HGG . Moreover , investigator approach devastate disease multi-disciplinary team evaluate quality life functional outcome result effective intervention .</detailed_description>
