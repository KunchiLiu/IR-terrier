	<detailed_description>Objectives : aim project two-fold : - The first aim evaluate relationship fatigue physical capacity , among multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient early stage disease relation plasmatic cytokine level ; - The second aim ass effectiveness self-management program physiotherapy , base endurance resistance physical exercise , MS patient early stage disease . Rationale scientific background : Multiple sclerosis affect one person per thousand people France Belgium . Two thousand patient newly diagnose France year . Fatigue early disabling symptom MS , affect 50 80 % MS patient . Fatigue describe patient chronic disable symptom associate decline motivation need rest . Fatigue occur spontaneously induced physical mental activity , acute infection , ingestion food . It occur time usually worsen along day . Fatigue multiple origin patient MS : brain lesion load , cortical atrophy , dysfunction hypothalamo-pituitary axis , depression physical deconditioning . Several approach seem promise improve fatigue : energy conservation program , help patient organize daily activity avoid fatigue , cognitive behavioural therapy , medication physical exercise . Patients MS show indeed degradation cardio-respiratory endurance . This degradation seem occur early course MS , already present patient mild neurological impairment . A deconditioning regularly find patient complain fatigue . However , literature provide clear information relationship physical deconditioning fatigue , early stage MS . Exercise medicine therefore promise approach management fatigue . Several study show improvement fatigue gait ability program physical exercise . Dalgas ( 2008 ) Sandoval ( 2013 ) propose recommendation endurance resistance exercise MS patient . Following recommendation , endurance training make walk cycling exercise , 2 3 time per week , intensity correspond 60-80 % predict maximal heart rate . The recommended duration session 10 40 minute , depend patient ' motor impairment . Resistance train preferentially supervise therapist , least first session . If training self-managed home-based , use weight body elastic band seem sufficient bring improvement muscle strength . Three four set exercise , separate 2-4 minute rest period , intensity 8 15 repetition 70 % predict maximum strength ( RM ) , seem effective carry 2-3 time per week . Each program include 4 8 various exercise . Few study rat benefit program long term early stage disease . A precocious exercise prescription could prevent deconditioning effect , include fatigue . Currently , small number patient benefit physiotherapy treatment base physical exercise . On one hand , multidisciplinary rehabilitation program ( include physiotherapy , occupational therapy , neuropsychology , physical exercise , ... ) implement impairment severe ( e.g . immediately relapse ) , due strict criterion reimbursement establish social insurance . Therefore , patient slightly impaired benefit program . Moreover , lack rehabilitation facility allow limited number patient participate multidisciplinary program . On hand , rehabilitation centre organize face-to-face group-based physiotherapy program specifically target physical exercise patient MS . Indeed , face-to-face program remain mainly focused neurodevelopmental theory ( Bobath , â€¦ ) . Finally , multidisciplinary program specific exercise-based program mostly implement hospital large centre rehabilitation . However , structure seem necessary main objective physical exercise , even stressful patient mild impairment . An alternative treatment may self-management physical exercise program , supervise physical medicine rehabilitation team . These program require limited cost patient society , do ecological environment ( i.e . patient life ) . These community-based rehabilitation program could therefore enable good adhesion treatment hospital treatment . The effectiveness self-managed rehabilitation poorly assess . Results literature conflicting , evidence lacking . These author point need randomise control trial . The aim project therefore implement physical exercise program patient early stage MS , include resistance cardio-respiratory endurance exercise . A multicenter , single-blind , randomise control trial carry assess effectiveness . This project also study fitness fatigue patient whose walk capacity preserve . It also note fatigue relate plasma level various cytokine ( e.g . Interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-10 , Interferon-gamma ( IFNg ) , Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ( TNFa ) ... ) suggest physical exercise could reduce fatigue effect transcription gene cod cytokine . In follow section , term `` self-management program '' refer whole program , include education , exercise , coach patient . Research project : This multicentre , single-blind , randomise control trial . All patient initially consultation investigator screen visit , two week inclusion . Inclusion exclusion criterion check , motivational interview patient do . Randomisation also carry visit , stratify enable equivalence Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score experimental control group . The randomization separate center . The first evaluation perform day study inclusion ( see ) , another investigator . A investigator carry assessment patient . The second evaluation take place two week later . Treatment begin week follow evaluation patient group . No detailed information give patient group 's treatment . They inform aim study compare two rehabilitation treatment , one base physical exercise one base relaxation . Patients experimental group participate four two preliminary group-based educational session one hour . The first session , group-based session , aim explain theoretical base physical exercise MS disease ( one hour ) . The next three session , face-to-face interview devote demonstration initial practice exercise patient perform self-management program ( three one hour ) . Patients individual appointment thirty minute immediately last session , order define program tailor individual goal . They ask least three physical exercise session per week , forty-five minute , period three month . The type exercise intensity also specify patient occasion . These exercise carry self-management program , directly supervise therapist . Patients control group receive two four session ( first one group second explain practice relaxation help soothe music ( four two hour ) . They invite practice relaxation home , least forty-five minute per day , least three time week , period three month . Two Three last evaluation conduct patient : one within week end study , one six month inclusion one nine month inclusion , order assess long-term effect treatment . At end study ( nine month inclusion ) , patient control group opportunity benefit self-management program exercise indirect supervision , comparable treatment receive experimental group study . All patient continue parallel usual medical paramedical treatment , include physiotherapy , treatment remain unchanged project . Protocol exercise : see Patients access virtual training book internet , ask list detail workout within hospital home ( number , date , duration , exercise conduct , intensity ) . If patient access internet home , train logbook give inclusion , allow list exercise detail session . The training monitor week electronic training book , therapist ( physician physical therapist ) , recommendation self-management training convey virtual logbook . A phone contact patient therapist schedule every two week . The patient encourage continue exercise regular basis . Recommendations tailor patient 's capacity exercise able achieve previous week . Every four week , group-based reminder session take place refer hospital , one experimental group one control group , order check adverse effect , exercise perform correctly , patient remains motivated continuation support . The internet logbook patient review occasion therapist order adapt exercise patient 's capability exercise carry previous week . For patient would internet home , exercise follow adapted week telephone contact patient therapist , consultation organise two week allow therapist examine training book adapt exercise necessary . The relaxation session control group carry help soothe music . Patients receive Compact Disc soothe music inclusion . Patients also electronic training logbook review week therapist . They phone contact therapist every two week , discuss treatment adapt necessary . They also reminder session every four week . Statistics : Pearson Spearman correlation coefficient permit study relationship fatigue physical capacity . The calculation intraclass correlation coefficient test reproducibility two first evaluation . A two-factors analysis variance ( ANOVA ) carry investigate effectiveness self-management program ( Group X time ) . The Holm-Sidak test use post-hoc test .</detailed_description>
