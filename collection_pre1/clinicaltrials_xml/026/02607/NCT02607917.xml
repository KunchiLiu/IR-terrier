	<detailed_description>Proposed demonstration implementation project increase appropriate use aspirin primary prevention acute myocardial infarction stroke population Minnesota . Although significant progress reduction acute myocardial infarction stroke apparent , cardiovascular disorder continue lead cause morbidity mortality . In recent year , context positive result large randomized clinical trial , grow consensus aspirin , appropriately use , reduce cardiovascular morbidity men age 45-79 woman age 55-79 year . The use aspirin primary prevention recommend U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Report 2009 recently CDC/CMS 'Million Hearts ' ABCs ( aspirin , blood pressure , cholesterol , smoke ) campaign . Aspirin use also recommend Healthy People 2020 goal . However , many adult would benefit , take aspirin . The investigator fortunate receive large philanthropic donation launch campaign increase appropriate aspirin use State Minnesota . The propose grant request fund evaluate campaign innovative approach proposes . In context innovative mass medium effort , investigator intend test new method health system change increase appropriate aspirin use . Using two-arm design , investigator define 24 geographic area state form basis group-randomized trial . This design allow u distinguish effect intervention method . The intervention evaluate sequential survey target-age general population baseline follow-up . Appropriate aspirin use population primary goal endpoint . Simultaneous survey adjacent Upper Midwestern state ( Iowa , North South Dakota , Wisconsin ) ass secular trend . Morbidity mortality data monitor disease trend complication associate aspirin use . A substantial pilot study middle size community Northern Minnesota allow u refine validate intervention measurement method community level . This pilot also demonstrate behavior change magnitude supportive design assumption . This program , successful , result generalizable program test real world population setting .</detailed_description>
