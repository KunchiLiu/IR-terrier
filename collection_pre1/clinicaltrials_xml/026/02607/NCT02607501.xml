	<brief_summary>An open label , prospective , multicentre , single-arm , post marketing study evaluate safety , technical feasibility , efficacy eCLIPs™ Family Products treatment bifurcation intracranial aneurysm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European eCLIPS™ Safety , Feasibility Efficacy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study obtain data technical feasibility , safety , efficacy eCLIPs™ Products treatment bifurcation aneurysm . Specifically , procedural success eCLIPs Bifurcation Remodelling System ( BRS ) evaluate determine feasibility product safety measure major stroke death within 30 day , major territorial stroke neurological death within one year . Additional endpoint evaluate data collect assess procedural success eCLIPs Products Microcatheter , Microintroducer , Detacher ) collect efficacy information eCLIPs Products . A rate 69 % aneurysms achieve Raymond Class 1 occlusion 12 month endpoint choose criterion success subject treat eCLIPs Device coil ( primary endpoint ) . An upper 95 % confidence interval 10 % rate major ipsilateral stroke death 1 month , 12 month endpoint choose demonstrate clinically safety ( primary endpoint ) .</detailed_description>
