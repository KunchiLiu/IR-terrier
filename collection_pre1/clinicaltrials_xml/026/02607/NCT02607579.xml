	<brief_title>Comparing Exparel &amp; Ropivacaine Pain Relief Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) associate intense early postoperative pain . Effective pain management follow total knee arthroplasty imperative facilitate early ambulation , mobilization rehabilitation . The postoperative pain regimen enhance functional recovery addition provide efficient analgesia minimal side effect . To manage postoperative pain effectively , multimodal analgesia include acetaminophen , Toradol , Solu-Medrol , opioids local anesthetic use . Periarticular infiltration perform intra-operatively combine ultrasound guide adductor-canal peripheral nerve block effective reduce pain follow TKA without cause quadriceps motor block impede mobilization . There publish trial investigator could find date , compare adductor canal block single dose Exparel adductor canal block standard ropivacaine . A liposome manufactured spherical lipid vesicle use slowly release drug thereby extend duration action . Exparel compound slowly release bupivacaine . Local anesthetic block conduction excitable tissue dose related fashion . The first tissue affected nerve , make drug choice neural block . Their local adverse effect include neurovascular manifestation prolong numbness , tingle , feel `` pin needle '' strange sensation . These effect reverse time . There additional potential risk adverse effect due procedure drug administer . The procedure well establish local anesthetic history long term use human .</detailed_description>
