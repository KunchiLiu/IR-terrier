	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety Efficacy Intratumoral IMO-2125 Combination With Ipilimumab Pembrolizumab Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label Phase 1/2 study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ass safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , immunogenicity , efficacy IMO-2125 administer combination ipilimumab pembrolizumab . The study conduct 2 part ; dose-escalation portion ( Phase 1 ) evaluate safety tolerability multiple dose level Phase 2 portion ass efficacy .</detailed_description>
