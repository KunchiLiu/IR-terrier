	<brief_summary>Hypercholesterolemia important risk factor cardiovascular disease , asociated primarily high plasma level LDL lipoprotein , turn depend endogenous hepatic synthesis cholesterol absorption intestinal level . It demonstrate reduce plasma LDL beneficial , mainly use statin , first treatment option moderate hypercholesterolemia . Phytosterols reduce intestinal absorption cholesterol reduce incorporation lipid micelle . Consequently , phytosterols become relevant alternative treatment low hypercholesterolemia . The target population 40 65 year old individual low hypercholesterolemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect On Serum Cholesterol Of Dairy Products With Addition Of Esterified Phytosterols</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Different protocol demonstrate phytosterol intake fluctuates 1000 2000 mg per day decrease LDL around 10 % , independently level blood triglyceride HDL ( high density lipoprotein ) concentration . In fact , National Cholesterol Education Program American Heart Association recommend addition 2 g/day phytosterols daily diet adult . This also recommended FDA ( Food Drug administration ) . Phytosterols delivery proven effective administrate lipid matrix margarine dressing low-fat skim milk yogurt , prove hypolipidemic effect . The investigational product consist powder milk drink yoghurt addition esterified phytosterols , total daily intake 1.95 g/day ( 1.17 g/day free equivalent ) . Primary objective : To evaluate impact Chilean population phytosterols incorporate dairy product reduction LDL cholesterol . Secondary objective : 1 . To evaluate potential change blood cholesterol concentration accord nutritional state age . 2 . To determine appearance symptom and/or effect intervention period . The trial design evaluate effect phytosterols incorporate low fat dairy product Chile , consumption one glass milk powder 90 mL drinking yoghurt , result daily consumption 1.95 g/day esterify phytosterols . This amount fall within demonstrated effective dos report literature .</detailed_description>
