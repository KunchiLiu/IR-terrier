	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Following tooth extraction , alveolar ridge undergoes mark change . During first year tooth extraction , 50 % bucco-lingual ridge dimension lose . Furthermore , ridge reduction become pronounce buccal lingual/palatal aspect . The hard tissue model remodelling follow tooth extraction study dog model . It demonstrate socket first occupy coagulum replace granulation tissue , provisional connective tissue woven bone . This immature hard tissue subsequently replace lamellar bone bone marrow . During heal phase , height buccal bone wall substantially reduce . In addition , 30 % marginal portion alveolar process extraction site lose . Several approach test preserve improve dimension contour ridge follow tooth extraction include use various graft filler material autograft , allograft , xenograft and/ barrier membrane . The recent study animal well human show placement xenograft fresh extraction socket promote de novo hard tissue formation , particular marginal portion extraction site . Moreover , consider dimension hard tissue wall maintain profile ridge preserve . The data concern socket preservation technique human still scarce . Therefore , firm conclusion dimensional change draw currently ; reality , socket preservation procedure may aid reduce bone dimensional change follow tooth extraction . However , completely prevent bone resorption loss width height may still expect ; even procedure allow good location implant placement minimize need GBR procedure simultaneously implant placement compare natural heal site . The histologic histomorphometric evaluation show early phase hard tissue formation alter extraction socket graft deproteinized bovine bone mineral immediately tooth removal . The author suggest modify wound heal bone modelling may influence presence multinucleated cell occur tissue harbour xenogenic graft . Thus , graft site , substantial amount newly form bone could detect apical portion socket graft material absent . In remain portion graft socket mildly inflame provisional matrix surround majority bovine bone mineral particle , whose surface frequently , always , coat multinucleated cell . The biological behaviour explain type biomaterial resorbable/or slowly resorbable . Given premise , prospective , randomized-controlled multicenter clinical study compare dimensional healing pattern , quality de novo bone formation implant placement large tooth extraction site graft two type xenograft : MP3 vs. Apatos Tecnoss- Osteobiol . Specific objective : - To augment fresh premolar molar extraction site MP3 Apatos ; - To evaluate dimensional ridge change MP3 Apatos ( clinical measurement volumetric evaluation computerize analysis study cast ) ; - To place implant ( BT EVO , Biotec , Povolaro , Italy ) 3 month graft ( diameter , length , need additional GBR procedure ) ; - To evaluate histological aspect bone biopsy take osteotomy preparation site ; - To follow monitor implant success treat site 24 month . The present study test first outcome null hypothesis difference 2 biomaterials alternative hypothesis difference ; - second long-term outcome performance implant place graft site . . Statistical Analysis The sample size calculate primary outcome measure ( implant failure ) ; decide recruit 30 patient group . Data analysis perform descriptive statistic independent sample t-test use comparison mean value group evaluate significant difference two treatment group .
