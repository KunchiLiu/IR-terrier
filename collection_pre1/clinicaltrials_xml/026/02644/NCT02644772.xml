	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether investigator predict patient risk re-exacerbation COPD within 30 90 day use change lung capacity initial exacerbation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Repeat Hospitalisations Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients admit hospital acute exacerbation COPD approach participate study . The investigator analyse change lung capacity ( measurement spirometry inspiratory capacity ) physical activity level first three day admission , discharge day 30 follow-up visit . The investigator record quality life symptom score time point day 90 telephone visit . Data relating patient overall health status -disease severity , co-morbidity , cognition , psychological status , home environment adherence inhale medication collect . The investigator look relationship change exacerbation within 30 90 day . The central hypothesis proposal clinical course follow exacerbation COPD may monitor measurement inspiratory capacity ( IC ) , marker lung hyperinflation . Resolution exacerbation related increase inspiratory capacity threshold level improvement , risk re-exacerbation within subsequent 30 90 day low . The investigator assess accuracy IC predictor exacerbation feasibility measure IC early stage COPD exacerbation .</detailed_description>
