	<brief_summary>Psoriasis vulgaris common , chronic , relapse skin disease characterize predominant involvement skin , nails joint . Recent advance patho-physiology shifted notion psoriasis 'disease skin ' 'T-cell mediate systemic disease ' . Better understanding pathogenesis co-morbidities along development novel therapeutic like biological response modifier change way dermatologist approach management psoriasis . Based extent involvement effect quality life , psoriasis may mild moderate severity . This turn form basis treatment majority patient . Topical therapy like coal tar , calcipotriol corticosteroid sufficient mild localize psoriasis . In widespread severe form associate significant decrease quality life patient , phototherapy systemic therapy indicate either alone combination . Although introduction biological therapy revolutionize treatment psoriasis recent year , new therapeutic option continue elude vast majority patient develop developed world traditional agent like methotrexate , cyclosporine , acitretin phototherapy still form backbone treatment . The association psoriasis metabolic syndrome well document . Metabolic syndrome cluster risk factor include central obesity , atherogenic dyslipidemia , hypertension glucose intolerance strong predictor cardiovascular disease , diabetes stroke . Metformin , oral hypoglycemic agent biguanide class know multitude action various facet metabolic syndrome . Recently also find inhibit keratinocyte proliferation cell culture model psoriasis . The present study design randomize control double blind pilot study 40 patient chronic plaque psoriasis moderate severity ( PASI ≥ 6 DLQI ≥ 6 ) metabolic syndrome ( By modify ATP III criterion ) 4 impaired glucose tolerance ( define two-hour glucose level 140 199 mg per dL 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ) recruit randomized two arm , A B 20 , use random number table . Patients arm A treated topical anti-psoriatic treatment ( include coal tar vitamin D3 analogue ) oral metformin 1g/day 850mg twice daily patient arm B treat topical anti-psoriatic treatment oral placebo tablet . Post randomization patient follow regular interval 24 week . During visit , patient arm assess severity psoriasis psoriasis activity severity index ( PASI ) body mass index ( BMI ) . Fasting blood glucose insulin level , glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) parameters metabolic syndrome ( include waist circumference , fast lipid profile blood pressure ) assess baseline week 16 24 . The primary aim study assess efficacy safety oral metformin add therapy treatment chronic plaque psoriasis moderate severity . The secondary aim ass effect metformin parameter metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>
