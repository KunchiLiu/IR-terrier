However , CPM rate increase among breast cancer patient , increase rate CPM particularly pronounce among young woman breast cancer , several study identify young age diagnosis one strong determinant CPM.11-13 Physicians researcher observe discuss trend number year yet little do intervene.14 The goal propose research well understand improve surgical decision process young woman breast cancer . Using qualitative research method , comprehensively assess patient experience - patient CPM patient - well physician perspective regard decision . Based finding , investigator determine best improve quality process , e.g. , correct misperceptions , set realistic expectation regard impact surgery ( include reconstruction ) QOL , improve communication health care provider , good management anxiety surround diagnosis . This qualitative research design build prior quantitative analysis , gain depth perspective focus group interview , certain issue identify impact surgical decision process , include anxiety , fear recurrence , patient-physician communication .</detailed_description>
