	<brief_title>Evaluation Physical Cognitive Performance After Simulated Road March Combines Physical Cognitive Load Using Virtual Reality Environment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>12 young , healthy civilian volunteer participate study . After read signing informed consent form , subject undergo medical examination include ECG , anthropometric measurement Vo2max test . Afterwards , subject perform randomly 3 experimental day , consist physical cognitive performance evaluation simulate road march use virtual reality environment ; without additional load , combine cognitive load road march , without physical load ( without march , wait evaluation ) control . The experiment take place dome room , system use : 1 . CAREN high ( Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment ) screen virtual scene dome . 2 . MOTEK ( Motek MedicalÂ© , Netherlands ) two track treadmill ( leg ) place rotatable platform . cognitive task example : navigation , identification remember cars/aircraft . Physical cognitive performance evaluate experimental day , perform protocol . end march , cognitive performance evaluate validated test laptop ( SYNWIN activity research service ) executive function evaluation base Trail Making Test ( TMT ) , afterwards , Physical performance evaluate HRV time exhaustion test ( 30 min end cognitive test ) .</detailed_description>
