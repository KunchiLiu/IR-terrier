	<detailed_description>Protocol Intrathecal Methotrexate Progressive Multiple Sclerosis : An Open Label Single Arm Study Introduction Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) characterize pathologically demyelination , axonal loss , glial scar formation . Clinically , patient relapsing-remitting course MS ( RRMS ) time may become progressive without remission - secondary progressive MS ( SPMS ) . About 15 % patient progressive course onset call primary progressive ( PP ) ( 1 ) . In past decade , several treatment approve mainly use RRMS . Treatments SPMS may still effective early phase course , become ineffective late phase SPMS ( 2,3 ) For PPMS , currently approve treatment . Thus , effective therapy need develop treatment SPMS PPMS . Methotrexate ( MTX ) , anti-metabolite , clinical use since 1948 find produce temporary remission acute childhood leukemia . Methotrexate irreversibly bind inhibits dihydrofolate reductase , inhibit formation reduce folate , thymidylate synthetase , result inhibition purine thymidylic acid synthesis , thus interfere DNA synthesis , repair , cellular replication . Because indirect immunosuppressive effect , MTX use treat autoimmune condition rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis ( 4 ) . Low dose oral MTX ( 7.5 mg weekly ) find mildly effective , slow deterioration patient SPMS ( 5 ) . There accumulate evidence progressive MS patient follicular lymphoid structure meninges Virchow-Robin space ( 8 ) . These follicle enrich lymphocyte dendritic cell may drive CNS inflammatory response disease . This CNS restrict immune response may unaffected systemic immunomodulation immunosuppressive therapy . Therefore , intrathecal therapy may target pathological follicular lymphoid activity . The safety intrathecal MTX ( ITMTX ) demonstrate widespread use treat lymphoproliferative disease leptomeningeal metastasis ( 9 ) . Sadik et . Al . report feasibility safety use intrathecal methotrexate ( ITMTX ) treatment unresponsive patient progressive form MS ( 10 ) . In open label study find ITMTX may beneficial effect progressive form MS well tolerate serious adverse event . In Last year investigator treat 8 patient IT MTX accord propose protocol . Until patient receive 1-3 therapy IT MTX without significance adverse event . The adverse event report : fatigue several day post therapy mild headache . Objective The investigator aim evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability intrathecal methotrexate administration progressive MS patient . Methods Study Population 30 progressive MS patient Inclusion Criteria - Age 18-750 year - Clinically definite diagnosis MS accord McDonald criterion 2010 . - Progressive disease form define confirm expanded disability status scale ( EDSS ) progression without relapse least 0.5 point great six month prior enrollment . Exclusion criterion - Pregnancy - Active infection - Significant associate medical condition malignancy , heart disease concurrent autoimmune condition . - Known allergy MTX . - WBC &lt; 4000 cells/µL - Lym &lt; 800 cells/µL - Treated fingolimod natalizumab 3 month prior enrollment Treatment The physician administer 12.5 mg MTX dilute concentration 4 mg/mL 0.9 percent sodium chloride 4 mg Dexamethasone via lumbar puncture needle . These dos standard dose IT treatment MTX . Treatments schedule 3 month apart 1 year .A tota 4 treatment 1 year . A CBC differential obtain treatment assess level hematological suppression . Evaluation A . Patients evaluate every 3 month physician treat physician following : Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) . 25 FW , 9 PHT , Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( SDMT ) , fatigue scale ( FSS ) depression scale ( BDI ) . In visit patient ask adverse event ( AE ) instruct report u every AE/ medical complain experience visit . AEs follow resolution completion study , whichever come first . All Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) follow event resolution , condition stabilizes , event otherwise explain , subject lose follow-up . The investigator responsible ensure follow-up include supplemental investigation may reasonably indicate elucidate nature and/or causality SAE . Any follow-up information regard SAEs must report Helsinki committee within 24 hour . Treatment The physician administer 12.5 mg MTX dilute concentration 4 mg/mL 0.9 percent sodium chloride 4 mg Dexamethasone via lumbar puncture needle . These dos standard dose IT treatment MTX . Treatments schedule 3 month apart 1 year .A tota 4 treatment 1 year . A CBC differential obtain treatment assess level hematological suppression . Laboratory test After obtain informed consent perform procedure , physician perform lumbar puncture 25 gauge needle cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sample obtain analyze parameter include cell count differential , protein glucose concentration , oligoclonal band , IgG concentration , cellular analysis flow cytometry CD3+ , CD20+ , CD14+ cell subset , measurement several soluble mediator : CXCL13 , CD23 , light chain , TNFa , IFNg , IL-17 , IL-2 , IL-10 , BDNF Neurofilaments study ELISA MRI scan Brain MRI scan do within 1 week treatment . The MRI protocol include follow sequence : T1 , T2 , FLAIR , T1 gadolinium , DTI .</detailed_description>
