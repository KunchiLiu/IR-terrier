	<brief_title>Comparison Human Acellular Vessel ( HAV ) With ePTFE Grafts Conduits Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , prospective , multicenter , multinational , open-label , randomize , two-arm , comparative study . Subjects sign inform consent would undergo study-specific screening assessment within 35 day day inform consent . On day surgery ( Day 0 ) , subject could still undergo screen assessment , confirmation inclusion/exclusion criterion , determine eligibility randomize study . Eligible study subject randomize receive either HAV one two commercially available ePTFE graft follow 24 month post-implantation routine study visit regardless patency status . After 24 month , subject patent study conduit follow ( study conduit remain patent ) 5 year ( 60 month ) post implantation routine study visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects ESRD , longer , candidate creation autologous AV fistula therefore need placement AV graft arm ( upper forearm ) start maintain hemodialysis therapy . Either hemodialysis expect start hemodialysis within 12 week study conduit implantation . At least 18 year age Screening . Suitable anatomy implantation straight loop conduit either forearm upper arm ( cross elbow ) . Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL platelet count ≥100,000 cells/mm3 prior Day 0 ( within 35 day ) . Other hematological biochemical parameter within range consistent ESRD prior Day 0 ( within 35 day ) . Adequate liver function prior Day 0 ( within 35 day ) , define : ≤2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) serum bilirubin , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ≤1.5 International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) prothrombin time ( PT ) ≤ 18 second unless subject take anticoagulant time Female subject must either : Of nonchildbearing potential , define postmenopausal ( least 1 year without menses prior Screening ) document surgically sterile post hysterectomy ( least 1 month prior Screening ) Or , childbearing potential , case : Must negative urine pregnancy test Screening , Must agree use least one form follow birth control method duration study : Established use oral , injectable implanted hormonal method contraception Placement intrauterine device intrauterine system Barrier method contraception : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/ gel/ film/ cream/ suppository Subject , legal representative , able communicate effectively investigative staff , competent willing give write informed consent , able comply entire study procedure include schedule followup visit .
