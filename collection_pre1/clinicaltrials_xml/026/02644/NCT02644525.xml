	<brief_summary>Background : Many people live west central Africa risk infection small worm call Loa loa . This infection acquire bite fly . Baby worm call microfilariae live blood . The infection commonly cause skin itching , mild temporary limb swelling , sometimes adult worm see white eye infect individual . Very rarely , people infection develop problem kidneys heart result worm effect immune system . Because vast majority people infection minimal symptom , people Cameroon usually get treat . But infection Loa loa cause serious problem people treat infection parasite ( namely , river blindness lymphatic filariasis ) . Researchers want find drug call imatinib treat Loa loa infection patient infection safely receive drug cure river blindness lymphatic filariasis . Researchers believe imatinib safe drug use Loa loa , lab drug kill worm slowly , whereas drug cause treatment reaction usually kill worm quickly . Objective : To test imatinib treat Loa loa infection kill worm slowly . Eligibility : People age 18 65 non-severe Loa loa infection otherwise healthy Design : Participants screen physical exam blood urine test . Participants baseline visit . This include physical exam blood urine test . It may include stool sample . Participants randomly assign get 1 dose either imatinib placebo Participants return clinic every day 1 week , week 3 week . Visits include physical exam blood test . They urine test first week . Participants follow-up visit 3 , 6 , 12 month take imatinib placebo . These include physical exam blood test . They may include urine stool sample . If participant develop side effect , treat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Microfilaricidal Kinetics Imatinib Treatment Loa Loa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With discovery people experience severe treatment reaction follow mass drug administration ( MDA ) ivermectin onchocerciasis lymphatic filariasis control co-infected Loa loa , need new filaricidal drug . Currently , Loa loa infection , consider relatively nonpathogenic , treated endemic area . However , treatment Loa loa result toxicity people concurrently treat onchocerciasis lymphatic filariasis , find new treatment Loa loa become priority . Imatinib recently show microfilaricidal vitro concentration physiologically achievable single oral dose human . Since ivermectin-based treatment reaction associate microfilarial ( MF ) concentration &lt; 25000 MF/ml rapid killing , study subject Loa loa infection low microfilarial level ( &lt; 5,000 MF/mL ) , level safely treat previously ivermectin . We aim perform dose escalation study identify minimum single oral dose effective slow microfiaricidal drug Loa loa . If imatinib find effective kinetics favor slow microfilarial killing , serve basis large study patient high microfilarial load would treat , risk population current MDA campaign . This double blind , randomize , pilot phase 2 dose-escalation trial . Subjects ( n = 5 ) receive dose imatinib 200 , 400 , 600 , 800mg . Symptoms blood microfilarial concentration assess baseline , daily first 7 day , weekly next 21 day , 3 , 6 , 12 month . These compare untreated placebo-controlled group 5 subject data collect respective day .</detailed_description>
