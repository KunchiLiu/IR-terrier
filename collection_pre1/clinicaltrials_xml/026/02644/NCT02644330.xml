	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety minimally invasive transthoracic device closure ventricular septal defect . This multi-center randomized control trial . Because characteristic surgical clinical trial , surgeon , ultrasonic department doctor , anesthesiologist , operate room nurse intensive care unit nurse need inform . Therefore result trial need system evaluate objective method reduce bias .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Transthoracic Device Closure Perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several examination need do patient , include X-ray , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , blood routine examination , liver kidney function , electrolytes , coagulation function infectious index check . And divide two group obtain informed consent : surgical group ( 50 case ) ; closure group ( 50 case ) . If closure fail , patient closure group convert surgical repair cardiopulmonary bypass . Recheck X-ray , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , blood routine examination , liver kidney function electrolyte need do patient two day operation . The patient follow X-ray , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram first month , third month , sixth month first year .</detailed_description>
