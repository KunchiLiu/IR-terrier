	<brief_summary>This safety ( Phase 1 ) trial use mebendazole recurrent pediatric brain cancer include medulloblastoma high grade glioma , long respond standard therapy . The drug mebendazole oral drug chewable 500 mg orange flavor tablet . It already approve treat parasitic infection . The purpose study determine safety side effect increase dos mebendazole , follow treatment additional 12 patient best tolerate dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Mebendazole Therapy Recurrent/Progressive Pediatric Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral mebendazole patient recurrent/progressive pediatric brain tumor confirm tolerance MTD oral mebendazole assess tolerance dose expansion cohort . Secondary Objectives study include determine safety , tolerability toxicity mebendazole patient population , determine plasma level mebendazole patient population Determine progression-free overall survival mebendazole extend cohort patient treatment refractory pediatric brain cancer . Mebendazole ( MBZ ) drug develop treat human helminthic disease FDA-approved treatment roundworm , common hookworm , American hookworm , pinworm whipworm . MBZ use well document frequently use tropical country higher dos rarer parasitic infection brain . We show efficacy preclinical laboratory model high grade glioma medulloblastoma . Mebendazole therapy demonstrate safety phase I clinical trial adult high grade glioma glioblastoma . This trial complete maximum approved enrollment 24 patient treated mebendazole , high dos consistent dose publish severe parasitic infection . Laboratory study indicate mebendazole enters brain brain tumor concentration may effective combination anti-cancer mechanism . In animal model brain cancer evidence suggest mebendazole prevent cell proliferation interfere tubulin formation , may prevent formation new abnormal blood vessel fee tumor growth . The patient experimental trial age 1 21 diagnosis medulloblastoma , high grade glioma , tumor resume growth continue grow despite standard medical therapy . High grade glioma World Health Organization ( WHO ) grade III IV . It include diagnosis pediatric glioblastoma , anaplastic astrocytoma , diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma . Patients fail form experimental therapy may also eligible trial . Mebendazole provide cost form chewable 500 mg tablet , recommend take three time daily meal food . The pill chew meal , ground mix food drink . It mild orange flavor similar consistency antacid tablet . Although side effect rare vast majority reversible , include stomach upset , decrease blood count , elevate liver enzyme due inflammation . The main additional procedure beyond take drug , patient request consent three additional blood draw check blood ( serum ) level drug ensure absorb sufficient dos . Patients continue receive drug long attend physician opinion therapy cause severe side effect , clear indication patient respond mebendazole therapy . Patients withdraw trial time reason , may eligible experimental therapy afterwards .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must confirm recurrent/progressive brain malignancy fail least one prior treatment regimen . 2 . Age inclusion trial time patient enrollment ≥ 1 year , 21 year ( prior 22nd birthday ) recurrent medulloblastoma recurrent high grade glioma may consent treated protocol . Patients turn 22 course trial continue treat . 3 . Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) &gt; 50 % patient ≥10 year age . Lansky score ≥ 50 child &lt; 10 year age . 4 . Life expectancy great 10 week . 5 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000 cell per microliter Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 750 cell per microliter Platelets ≥ 75,000 cell per microliter aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal Total Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal OR Creatinine Clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 patient creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal 6 . The effect mebendazole develop human fetus unknown . In rats evidence teratogenic effect , although evidence adverse effect woman accidently take mebendazole ( low dos ) pregnancy . For reason , woman childbearing potential agree use birth control take mebendazole reasonable risk pregnancy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 7 . Ability patient ( applicable parent legal guardian ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document , parent legal guardian give assent case young patient unable understand sign consent . 8 . For patient parent/legal guardian able comply treatment plan , study procedure followup examination . 9 . Failed previous front line standard care therapy currently use patient 's initial diagnosis . 10 . Ability swallow pill , liquid formulation patient parent/legal guardian keep accurate medication record . 1 . Patients know allergy mebendazole . 2 Patients previously severe side effect , agranulocytosis neutropenia , conjunction previous mebendazole benzimidazole class drug parasitic infection . 3 Patients take metronidazole safely move different antibiotic great 7 day prior start mebendazole therapy . Metronidazole mebendazole combination associate StevensJohnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis case report . 4 Patients previously take mebendazole part experimental anticancer protocol , fail therapy . 5 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , uncontrolled hypertension , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , chronic hepatitis , acute hepatitis , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 6 Pregnant woman exclude mebendazole Class C agent potential teratogenic effect . Because know mebendazole excrete breast milk , breastfeed discontinue mother treated mebendazole . 7 Patients human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B surface antigen hepatitis C positive ; history chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis . 8 Patients history medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality opinion investigator may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation result . 9 Patients available followup assessment unable comply study requirement .</criteria>
