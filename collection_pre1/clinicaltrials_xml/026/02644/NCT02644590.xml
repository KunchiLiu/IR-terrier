	<detailed_description>Premature extensive atherosclerosis increase risk cardio-vascular disease ( CVD ) major cause morbidity mortality patient type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) , 20 fold increase mortality CVD . Most subject diabetes develop hypertension major determinant microvascular cardiovascular complication . The pediatric population much less studied nevertheless sufficient data suggest risk CVD emerge childhood . Up 16 % adolescent T1DM hypertension , study use 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) normotensive adolescent T1DM identify loss diurnal systolic rhythm nocturnal hypertension . Moreover , many normotensive patient , may loss physiologic drop BP night ( `` non-dippers '' ) correlate early vascular change . This early change frequently lead frank hypertension later . The prevalence CVD population point importance early identification know CVD risk factor early intervention . Data Pathological Determinant Youth ( PDAY ) study show early change lead atherosclerosis exist adolescence . These data stress importance identify asymptomatic patient early stage vascular change . Sleep Hypertension : During adolescence , total sleep duration change sleep/wake time shift teenager go bed late wake even later . The circadian timing system responsible phase delay sleep influence hormonal change puberty , specifically delay melatonin secretion . Only 20 % adolescent meet recommendation hour sleep week ( 9-9.25 h ) , adolescent frequently overcompensate weekend delay awaken time . There limited data describe sleep pattern type T1DM patient . Altered sleep may great relevance adolescent T1DM , disrupt sleep architecture occur child diabetes , sleep depravation impair insulin sensitivity diabetic subject . We previously publish study compare sleep habit diabetic non-diabetic adolescent , show despite intensive treatment require involve eat inject insulin certain time , include early morning , diabetic adolescent make adjustment sleep habit compare healthy adolescents10 . It previously report certain situation disrupt sleep occurs , include night shift worker , loss `` nocturnal dip '' blood pressure.11 In preliminary observational study perform diabetes clinic Safra child 's hospital able identify 50 % adolescent T1DM `` non-dippers '' measure continuous BP use ABPM . More 20 % diabetic adolescent frank hypertension 95th % ile age height compare 0 % control group , despite normotensive clinic visits12 . In addition , significant increase hypertension load see diabetic compare health control sleep , wake hour . All information describe , point towards hypothesis adolescent T1DM risk develop nocturnal hypertension still remain normotensive assess clinic visit . Studies carry Grossman et al . Sheba medical center show impaired nocturnal melatonin secretion non-dipper hypertensive patient , improvement nocturnal BP use control release ( CR ) melatonin . 13-14 Melatonin circulate neurohormone secrete predominantly night . It important convey daily cycle light darkness body , thus regulate circadian rhythm . In addition ' regulatory role , melatonin antioxidative capacity , immunomodulatory potency , anabolic property may diminish treatment insulin . It show adolescent T1DM secrete reduce level melatonin compare healthy controls.15 Melatonin use many year pediatric population various sleep disorder study assess property , include nocturnal BP control , good safety profile.16-17 . Study Aim : To assess effect treatment melatonin nocturnal hypertension adolescent young adult T1DM . PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION The suggested study take place pediatric diabetes clinic Sheba medical center . We aim recruit 30 adolescent age 12-21years T1DM . Recruitment phase plan last year . Inclusion criterion : T1DM least 2 year . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Known hypertension . 2 . Use BP lower medication . 3 . Abnormal kidney function liver function . 4 . Lactose intolerance . Study design : Cross sectional analysis : Each subject overnight ABPM do . The purpose phase identify subgroup `` non-dippers '' . The group `` non-dippers '' recruit interventional phase . Interventional phase : 15-20 subject abnormal ABPM study treat Melatonin-CR 2mg ( Circadin® ) total 4 week repeat ABPM do . Comparison ABPM result first test second test follow 1 month melatonin treatment do . Methods : Eligible patient approach recruited routine clinic visit . After consent , subject provide ABMP device , either clinic visit deliver home one investigator research assistant . The patient instruct position BP cuff arm start record BP . Blood pressure monitor do use ABPM device ( SpaceLabs ) commonly use clinical purpose . During follow day test , ABPM device collect family investigator . Melatonin tablet provide subject , take within 1 hour go sleep night . Subjects contact follow first night study monitor adverse event , subject provide contact information researcher report adverse reaction mey occur month study . Safety : Apart extensive use melatonin child , excellent safety profile , specific brand use study - Circadin® , control release formulation , use multiple study , include child good safety profile18-21 . Indications termination study participation participant : 1 . Development adverse effect melatonin . 2 . Intercurrent medical condition require hospitalization treatment BP lower medication . 3 . Participant parent wish stop study reason . Clinical surveillance study : Participants contact follow first night receive melatonin weekly completion study , screen adverse event . Participants receive direct phone number physician study group contact time question relate drug adverse event study . Any adverse event document severe , consideration give regard stop study altogether report Helsinki committee ministry health . Statistical analysis : Rates abnormal nocturnal BP compare pretreatment group post treatment group use x2 analysis . Continuous variable systolic diastolic BP compare use t-test , pre post treatment . Pearson 's correlation coefficient use correlation analysis BP clinical data diabetes duration , metabolic control ( HbA1c ) . Multivariate analysis use assess clinical demographic strong predictor nocturnal HTN . Clinical importance : Nocturnal hypertension identify use ABPM early sign hypertension adolescent T1DM . We previously show present significant number diabetic adolescent . Melatonin , previously show adult , may modify change would desirable effect patient risk cardiovascular complication .</detailed_description>
