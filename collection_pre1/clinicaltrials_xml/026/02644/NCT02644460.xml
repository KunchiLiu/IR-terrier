	<detailed_description>Stratum A- Appropriate dose RT administer 30-33 fraction approximately 6 week Stratum A patient . Treatment abemaciclib ( LY2835219 ) start day RT continue twice daily RT maximum treatment duration 2 year . Investigators plan treat maximum 4 cohort research participant ( dosage level 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) escalating dos abemaciclib ( LY2835219 ) start dose level 1 ( 80 % adult dose ) . A cycle define 28 day first 6 week therapy constitute dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) -evaluation period . Participants must take abemaciclib mouth intact capsule . Stratum B - Abemaciclib ( LY2835219 ) administer orally twice daily basis continuously 28 day , define one cycle . The maximum treatment duration 2 year . Investigators plan treat maximum 4 cohort research participant ( dosage level 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) escalating dos abemaciclib start dose level 1 ( 80 % adult dose ) . Dose escalation independent Stratum A escalation . A cycle define 28 day first 4 week therapy constitute DLT-evaluation period .
