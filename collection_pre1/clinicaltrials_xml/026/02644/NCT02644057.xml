The underlie pathophysiology CRS poorly understand consider multifactorial . Worsening renal function define increase serum creatinine &gt; 0.3mg/dl baseline occur 20-30 % patient ADHF associate great length hospital stay , hospital readmission death . A number intervention use include give diuretic help decongestion help heart pump blood effectively . Sometimes therapy effective may even lead worsen renal function . In case , inotrope agent increase contractility heart use help pump blood vital organ .

	<detailed_description>Heart failure recognize one common indication hospitalization amongst adult age &gt; 65 year United States estimate Medicare cost 17billion . Chronic heart failure one life threaten cardiovascular disorder think affect nearly six million US population annual death rate 600,000 . Cardiorenal syndrome although completely understood full context - term coin disorder heart kidney whereby acute chronic dysfunction one precipitate acute chronic dysfunction . Concomitant kidney failure amongst patient acute decompensated heart failure commonly observe . Direct indirect effect heart failure hemodynamic insult identify primer acute kidney injury dysfunction . Patients preexist underlying renal disease likely develop worsen renal failure set ADHF venous congestion important hemodynamic factor driving . Worsening renal function define increase serum creatinine &gt; 0.3mg/dl baseline occur 20-30 % patient ADHF associate great length hospital stay , hospital readmission death . The treatment ADHF include step intravenous diuretic therapy addition optimize baseline medicine limit frequently diuretic resistance worsen creatinine level precluding use Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEi ) , Angiotensin Receptor Blocking Agents ( ARBs ) , Spironolactone . Ultrafiltration/Aquapheresis still remain option treat non-responders medical therapy . Inotropes know produce beneficial hemodynamic effect heart lead well titration oral regimen . Short term continous intravenous infusion inotropic agent patient document severe systolic dysfunction present significantly depress cardiac output maintain end organ perfusion show beneficial per ACC/AHA guideline 2013 management heart failure . The use intravenous inotropes remain still controversial topic term short live long term efficacy renal recovery acute decompensated heart failure . In view large proportion patient admit acute decompensated heart failure real world study compare different inotropes improve kidney function , investigator aim compare efficacy dobutamine milrinone improve kidney function also effect length stay , symptomatic improvement medication optimisation 1 . The primary objective study objectively measure response dobutamine v milrinone renal recovery patient cardiorenal syndrome ( &gt; 0.3mg/dl increase creatinine baseline ) admit acute decompensated heart failure . These objective measure include change serum creatinine , change weight . 2 . The secondary objective measure length hospitalization , readmission rate unscheduled visit clinic ER 60 day follow period . The investigator also measure change symptom assess use global dyspnea visual analog scale every 24 hour patient discharge . 3 . The secondary objective also include measure diuretic dose , medicine optimization include initiation beta blocker / ace inhibitor discharge , 30 day 60 day interval 4 . The investigator subdivide patient ischemic versus non ischemic end trial see response category patient</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; 18 year 2 . Admitted hospital primary diagnosis Decompensated Heart Failure 3 . Onset cardiorenal syndrome ( increase creatinine &gt; 0.3mg/dl ) hospitalization . After hospitalization within 7 day time admission receive intravenous diuretic heart failure medication optimization . Before hospitalization set escalate dos outpatient loop diuretic heart failure medication optimization 4 . Persistent volume overload For patient pulmonary artery catheter , peristent volume overload include : Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &gt; 22mm Hg one follow clinical sign :2+ peripheral edema and/or pulmonary edema pleural effusion chest Xray . For patient without pulmonary artery catheter persistent volume overload include atleast 2 following : 2+ peripheral edema , jugular venous pressure &gt; 10 mm Hg pulmonary edema pleural effusion chest Xray 5 . BNP &gt; 400 6 . Cr1.23.0 1 . Intravascular volume depletion 2 . Acute coronary syndrome within 4 week 3 . Indication hemodialysis 4 . Systolic Blood pressure &lt; 90mm Hg MAP &lt; 60mm Hg time enrollment 5 . Alternate explanation worsen renal function , obstructive nephropathy , contrast induce nephropathy , ATN 6 . Clinical instability likely require addition intravenous vasoactive drug include vasodilator and/or inotropic drug 7 . The use iodinate radiocontrast material past 72 hour anticipate use intravenous contrast current hospitalization 8 . Underlying rhythm disorder</criteria>
