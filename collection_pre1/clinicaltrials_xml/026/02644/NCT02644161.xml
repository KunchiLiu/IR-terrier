	<brief_summary>An 8-week , assessor-blind , randomize control trial conduct . A total 138 patient post-stroke depression ( PSD ) randomly assign combination acupuncture treatment ( CAI ) ( n = 69 ) least acupuncture stimulation ( LAS ) ( n = 69 ) 3 session per week 8 week . Treatment outcomes measure use 17-item Hamilton Self-Rating Depression Scale ( HAMD-17 ) , Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , Self-Rating Depression Scale ( SDS ) depression symptom ; Barthel Index ( BI ) physical function , Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) cognitive performance . The assessment perform baseline monthly thereafter . The study conduct School Chinese Medicine Clinics , Tung Wah Hospital , Kowloon Hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Acupuncture Treat Post-stroke Depression ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mood depression common serious consequence stroke ( Paolucci , 2008 ) . There approximately 30 % stroke patient develop PSD , either early late stage stroke ( Paolucci , 2008 ) . Despite fact PSD strongly associate poor prognosis increase disability , often neglect clinical management , minority PSD patient could receive proper diagnosis treatment ( Gustafson et al. , 1995 ; Paolucci , 2008 ; Williams et al. , 2004 ) . Although pharmacological treatment , represent various type antidepressant , recommend first-line drug PSD , effectiveness unsatisfactory clinical use largely hamper due apparent shortcoming . A large portion PSD patient could obtain satisfactory outcome antidepressant treatment , particular elderly ( Bhogal et al. , 2005 ; Paolucci , 2008 ) . Pharmacotherapy related side effect ; particularly cardiovascular system may exacerbate stroke patient ' condition ( Paolucci , 2008 ) . Furthermore , stroke patient often medicate various class drug , addition antidepressant agent may increase risk drug-drug interaction , result unexpected unpredictable adverse event ( Hemeryck Belpaire , 2002 ) . The development alternative treatment strategy PSD patient therefore highly desire . While acupuncture effective reduce pain disorder , also possess psychotropic potential treat psychiatric symptom , particular depression , anxiety sleep disturbance . Our systematic review meta-analysis suggest clinical outcome acupuncture equivalent antidepressant treat major depression superior pharmacotherapy improve clinical response reduce severity PSD , few incidence adverse event ( Zhang et al. , 2010 ) . Recently , investigator develop novel acupuncture stimulation mode call dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation ( DCEAS ) , electrical stimulation directly deliver dense acupoints ( 6-8 pair general ) locate forehead innervate trigeminal sensory pathway . This pathway intimate afferent fiber project brainstem reticular formation , pivotal brain region contain serotonin ( 5-HT ) norepinephrine ( NE ) neuronal cell involve process mood signal . neuroanatomic rationale DCEAS electrical stimulation dense scalp acupoints could enhance activity brainstem nuclei contain 5-HT NE neuronal system via trigeminal sensory nucleus , modulate brain region related mood processing ( Zhang et al. , 2012 ) .Our serial clinical study demonstrate effectiveness DCEAS alike modes patient major depression , postpartum depression , insomnia obsessive compulsive disorder ( Chung et al. , 2012 ; 2014 ; Huang et al. , 2004 , 2005 ; Qu et al. , 2013 ; Zhang et al. , 2009 , 2012a ) . Most recently , pilot study confirm DCEAS effective reduce stroke patient ' depressive symptom ; combination DCEAS body acupuncture ( CAI ) effective reduce neuropsychiatric sequela stroke ( Man et al. , 2014 ) . These encouraging result warrant large-scale controlled trial . The pathogenesis PSD mainly associate decreased serotonin ( 5-HT ) norepinephrine ( NE ) function brain ( Gustafson et al. , 1995 ) . On hand , neuro-anatomic rationale DCEAS electrical stimulation dense scalp acupoints could enhance activity brainstem nuclei contain 5-HT NE neuronal system via trigeminal sensory nucleus , modulate brain region related mood processing ( Zhang et al. , 2012b ) . Based study , investigator hypothesize CAI could yield well treatment outcome improve PSD compare Least acupuncture stimulation ( LAS ) control . An apparent advantage TCM clinical practice individualize personalized treatment , i.e. , treatment protocol tailor meet individual 's current clinical manifestation different stage illness , term differentiation syndrome . Previous study suggest potential relationship therapeutic efficacy acupuncture TCM syndromes PSD ( Dang , 2013 ; Wu , 2010 ; Xin et al. , 2005 ) . The investigator determine whether correlate TCM syndromes PSD CAI treatment . The work hypothesis propose study CAI effective intervention improve PSD comorbid symptom often observe stroke patient . To test hypothesis , 8-week , assessor-blind , randomize , control trial propose determine : ( 1 ) whether patient treat CAI could produce significantly great improvement treat LAS ( 2 ) whether correlate TCM syndromes PSD CAI treatment .</detailed_description>
