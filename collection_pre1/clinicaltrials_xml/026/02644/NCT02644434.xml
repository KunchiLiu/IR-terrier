	<detailed_description>1 . Statistical Design Analysis . 1.1 Analysis Population ( ) . 1.1.1 Intent Treat Population ( ITT , primary clinical endpoint ) . The ITT population set consist subject sign write informed consent randomize , regardless strategy select . The primary analysis superiority ITT analysis primary clinical endpoint , side branch occlusion main vessel stenting . 1.1.2 Per Protocol ( PP , clinical endpoint ) . If require , additional analysis Per-Protocol ( PP ) population conduct primary secondary endpoint . The PP population consist subject correctly receive ( ) assign study stent . Should subject correctly receive ( ) assign study stent ( ) , PP analysis require clinical endpoint . 1.2 Statistical Methods . 1.2.1 Statistical Hypothesis Primary Endpoint . H0 : Pt-Pc ≥0 ; H1 : Pt-Pc &lt; 0 ; Pt Pc rate side branch occlusion intentional strategy ( test ) convention strategy ( control ) group , respectively . The study power 80 % show differences rate side branch occlusion intentional strategy group conventional strategy group . The primary analysis perform ITT patient population . 1.2.2 Statistical Test Method Primary Endpoint . Normal approximation test difference two proportion ( pooled proportion ) Fisher 's exact test ( applicable ) use test two-sided hypothesis superiority proportion . If P value two-sided test &lt; 0.05 , intentional strategy ( test ) conclude superior conventional strategy . This correspond two-sided upper 95 % confidence bound difference treatment group side branch occlusion ( intentional strategy - conventional strategy ) less delta . 1.2.3 Sample Size Parameters Primary Endpoint . - A 1:1 treatment allocation ratio intentional strategy group conventional strategy group - A two-side significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 - 80 % power show difference rate side branch occlusion intentional strategy group conventional strategy group - The rate side branch occlusion intentional strategy group : 4.0 % - The rate side branch occlusion conventional strategy group : 10.0 % - The primary endpoint would reach immediately main vessel stenting , therefore , attrition rate 0 % The 10 % rate side branch occlusion conventional strategy group base V-RESOLVE study . It reasonable assume , intentional strategy bifurcation lesion V-RESOLVE score ≥12 point , rate side branch occlusion would decrease 4 % intentional strategy group . Thus , present study require 283 subject intentional strategy group 283 conventional strategy group , total number 566 . 1.3 Secondary Endpoint Analysis . For secondary endpoint result intentional strategy conventional strategy group compare . For clinical endpoint analysis perform follow-up visit , mean 1 Month , 3 Months , 6 Months 12 Months . The analysis perform ITT population , applicable , PP population . For secondary endpoint conventional p-values 95 % confidence interval difference Kaplan-Meier calculate . Dichotomous variable evaluate use Fisher 's exact test . Continuous variable evaluate two-sample t-test , 95 % confidence interval p-value report . For time-dependent analysis , Hazard Ratios evaluate use Cox proportional hazard model Kaplan Meier estimate evaluate accord log-rank test . 1.4 Missing Data . Every effort undertaken minimize miss data . The following approach handle miss data adopt base type outcome endpoint analyze . Kaplan-Meier estimate censor incomplete data last date available follow-up information , assume complete reporting event date event status unknown date . 1.5 Calculating Days Event . When calculate days-to-event , date event take place always compare index procedure date , also case stag procedure take place . 1.6 Within Patient Correlation . In case patient one lesion analyze , in-patient correlation take account . 2 . Study Data Reporting , Monitoring Quality Assurance . 2.1 Data Recording . The data collection tool study validate electronic data capture system contain system generate audit trail . Data require accord protocol record investigational site personnel via data entry internet base Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) software system . All internal external investigational site personnel seek access must go train process grant access electric Case Report Form ( eCRF ) . Training record maintain . All personnel access eCRF support Service Desk ( applicable ) . Clinical data management perform accordance applicable sponsor's/Clinical Research Organization ( CRO ) 's standard data cleaning procedure . This applicable data record eCRF well data source ( e.g . laboratory , ECG , adjudication committee ) . Edit check query build EDC application describe Data Management Plan . Queries generate rule raise reviewer generate resolve within EDC application . During review , subject data check consistency , omission , apparent discrepancy . All Adverse Events , medication medical history ( applicable ) cod use Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) . Data receive external source central lab reconcile clinical database . Serious Adverse Events clinical database reconcile safety database . 2.2 Source Documentation . It investigator 's responsibility data entry make eCRF support source document maintain subject enrol study . Source document include recording observation notation clinical activity report record necessary evaluation clinical study . The site must implement process ensure availability require source documentation . 2.3 Monitoring . Monitoring clinical investigation study site responsibility monitor organization train qualified Clinical Research Associates ( CRAs ) . Monitoring perform described Monitoring Plan . 2.4 Audit Inspection . To ensure compliance Good Clinical Practices ( GCP ) regulatory requirement , member sponsor 's ( designate CRO 's ) quality assurance unit may arrange conduct audit assess performance study study site study document originate . The investigator/institution inform audit outcome . In addition , inspection regulatory health authority representative Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) possible . The investigator notify sponsor immediately inspection . The investigator/institution agree allow auditor inspector direct access relevant document allocate his/her time time his/her staff auditor/inspector discuss finding issue . Audits inspection may occur time completion study . In accordance GCP Sponsor 's audit plan , study may select audit representative Sponsor . Inspection site facility ( e.g. , pharmacy , Device storage area , laboratory etc . ) review study relate record occur order evaluate study conduct compliance protocol , GCP , applicable regulatory requirement . 2.5 Archiving . All Case Report Forms ( CRFs ) , study record , report source document support CRFs must retain file responsible Investigators minimum 2 year follow notification Sponsor designee investigation complete , retain accordance local international guideline identify clinical study agreement . This documentation must accessible upon request international regulatory authority , Sponsor ( designee ) . The sponsor designee , must approve archive transfer documentation relocation purpose premise , writing , prior actual file transfer . The investigator must notify Sponsor , writing , transfer location , duration , procedure access study documentation . The Investigator must contact Sponsor , designee , destruction record report pertain study ensure long need retain . If Investigator retire , relocates , reason withdraw assume primary responsibility keep study record , custody per write notice must submit Sponsor , designee , indicate name address person accept primary responsibility . The Ethics Committee ( EC ) must notify write name address new custodian . 2.6 Deviations Protocol . A protocol deviation define event study conduct accord protocol applicable regulation . Protocol deviation collect include , limited following : - Failure obtain informed consent failure obtain informed consent prior study procedure ; - Enrolling subject meet inclusion criterion , meet exclusion criterion ; - Not complete protocol-required examination evaluation . A Protocol Deviation eCRF need complete separately type deviation submit Sponsor review Regulatory Body , EC require . Protocol deviation reportable Sponsor soon possible occurrence . 2.6.1 Site Non-Compliance . If excessive protocol deviation note , Sponsor reserve right suspend study enrollment sufficient system place site reduce deviation , withdraw site participation study . 2.7 Compliance Standard Regulations . The protocol , informed consent form study-related document submit EC / IRB . The study perform accordance Declaration Helsinki GCP . The trial start clinical site write approval study obtain appropriate national EC/IRB .</detailed_description>
