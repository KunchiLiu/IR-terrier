	<brief_summary>This pilot study try minimize pain exposure new red light source ( RhodoLED® , Biofrontera Bioscience GmbH , Leverkusen , Germany ) use PDT without compromise effect AKs . The study design open prospective , two-armed , split-face design . Participants AK lesion distribute symmetrically scalp , forehead , cheek , torso , back , arm and/or dorsal part hand eligible inclusion . The purpose investigate modify irradiation protocol lower pain effect AK clearance rate compare standard PDT irradiation protocol . Before study-related procedure perform , participant thoroughly inform study give opportunity ask question . The participant thereafter sign date inform consent form . This constitute visit 0 . On visit 1 , randomization either standard modify irradiation protocol perform one side face/body irradiation protocol apply side face/body . The participant AKs two comparable site , i.e . two cheek , arm dorsal part hand . One side randomize receive PDT BF200-ALA irradiation RhodoLED® lamp side receive BF200-ALA Aktilite CL-128 lamp ( PhotoCure ASA , Oslo , Norway ) , traditional lamp use department mention . The treatment give visit 1 . During treatment , participant ask continuously , every third minute , estimate pain treatment side use visual analogue scale , VAS , ( 0 pain 10 bad pain imaginable ) . At end treatment , participant also ask summarize treatment whole VAS-scale . After visit 1 , participant fill follow-up diary form question regard adverse effect ( AEs ) hour day treatment . The efficacy treatment also assess follow-up ( FU ) visit , visit 2 . The investigator aim non-inferior analysis , i.e . new modified irradiation protocol least good standard irradiation protocol . The randomization blind investigator FU visit minimize possibility favor one irradiation protocol .</brief_summary>
