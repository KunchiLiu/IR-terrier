	<detailed_description>A supraglottic airway device ( SAD ) , also refer laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) , medical device maintains patient airway , allow unobstructed ventilation anaesthesia . They design sit patient 's hypopharynx ( throat ) , elliptical head form seal around supraglottic structure ( patient `` voice box '' ) . They common use since 1989 , transform anaesthetic practice predominant airway device within anaesthesia , use approximately 56 % general anaesthetic case UK ( 1 ) . Their popularity routine use stem perceive benefit traditional form airway management couple high overall success rate low complication rate . SADs , anaesthetic practice , insert induction general anaesthesia , supervision , train medical professional . All patient fully monitor set Association Anaesthetist Great Britain Ireland ; Recommendations standard monitor anaesthesia recovery ( 2 ) . Devices use concordance manufacturer instruction . Successful first time placement achieve large majority patient allow provision oxygen ventilation . In patient , one device size device may present sub-optimal performance result removal device . Further action scenario would include attempt second insertion device , attempt insertion alternative size device attempt alterative design device order achieve patent airway . Further attempt may take limited avoid unnecessary trauma . In case use SAD abandon patient intubate endotracheal tube order provide safe secure airway . Alternatives use SAD airway management include use simple facemask tracheal intubation endotracheal tube . Advantages use SAD anaesthetic airway management compare facemask improve oxygen saturation less operator/anaesthetist fatigue . Compared endotracheal tube advantage use SAD improved haemodynamic stability induction emergence anaesthesia , reduce anaesthetic requirement , improve quality emergence , low incidence sore throat , increase ease placement reduce risk dental damage . Risks use LMA compare endotracheal tube increase gastric insufflation aspiration common patient poorly select anaesthesia SAD . Sore throat common complication study There significant development design SAD market recent year development `` second generation '' range device involve new material design integrate protective bite block , gastric drainage channel improve supraglottic seal enhance patient safety use device . There new `` third generation '' SADs market design may enhance anaesthetic practice improve patient safety . This study follow similar ethically approved protocol use publish study compare airway equipment ( 3,4 ) . These 2 example hundred LMA study throughout literature . The Ambu AuraGain new device study fully . Comparative study frequently assess oropharyngeal leak pressure ( OLP ) , fibre optic assessment glottic alignment , ease insertion , ability insert nasogastric tube gastric port frequency manipulation . We propose crossover design well detect difference two device eliminate confound difference patient characteristic demographic . There significant development design SAD market recent year Our proposal would carry randomise crossover comparison new `` third generation '' SAD ; AuraGainTM ( Ambu , Copenhagen , Denmark ) current `` second generation '' SAD ; i-gel ( Intersurgical Ltd , Wokingham , UK ) examine compare key performance indicator use . The AuraGain new device market compare device yet .</detailed_description>
