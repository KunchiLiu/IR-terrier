	<brief_summary>Flatfoot , one common foot problem experience preschool-aged child , characterize collapse foot 's medial longitudinal arch . Children motor developmental delay often flatfoot , accord clinical observation , research indicate preschool age main stage medial longitudinal arch development period . There flatfoot symptom due poor arch shock effect , poor walk endurance , likely cause gait problem grow . The lack stable foot structure support maintain posture may lead delayed motor development . Early training intervention help balance stability main rehabilitation goal motor developmental delayed child . With understanding foot development motor development delay child , proper intervention provide improve movement stability low limb . The possible deformation foot structure resultant pain future also prevent .</brief_summary>
