	<brief_summary>Post-endodontic pain ( PP ) still major problem endodontic patient , analgesic routinely prescribe . Incidence PP report extensively , review . PP complicate multi factorial process affect factor related patient , tooth skill experience dentist , interrelation factor consider PP , study data might confuse . Any study try evaluate effect specific technique new device incidence characteristic PP control confound factor describe involve tested outcome . report mention variable prevalence PP , range 82.9 10.6 % . These variation difference study method , treatment procedure root canal treatment , selection patient experience skill dentist , vary different study compare . Many study confirm chemomechanical debridement root canal result extrusion dentinal chip , pulp tissue fragment , necrotic tissue , microorganism , root canal irrigants apical foramen . All preparation technique instrument , regardless maintain short work length apical terminus report related extrusion infect debris , extrude less material others extrude . Periapical inflammation postoperative flare-up may result apical extrusion debris also refer `` worm '' necrotic debris A common outcome study examine amount apically extrude debris technique involve push-pull filing motion usually produce great mass apical debris rotational action Files reciprocate in-and-out filing motion , may act piston , extrude debris irrigants . While file continuous rotation motion like screw conveyor improve transportation dentinal chip debris coronally . In study , investigator compare post-endodontic pain two system . Mtwo ( continuous rotation system ) safe-sider ( reciprocate system ) . Therefore , aim study Evaluation post-endodontic pain root canal treatment two rotary system : Mtwo &amp; safe-sider</brief_summary>
