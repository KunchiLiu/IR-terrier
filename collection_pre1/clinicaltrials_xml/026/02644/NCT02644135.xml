	<detailed_description>Significance Background Respiratory tract disease major cause morbidity mortality throughout world accounting approximately 4 million death worldwide . Asthma , pneumonia , acute bronchiolitis account almost 22 % pediatric hospitalization United States . Pneumonia remain top ten cause admission across age group United States . Much directly cause , trigger respiratory virus include influenza , parainfluenza , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , adenovirus . In addition well-known pathogen , advancement molecular genomic technique increase detection identification new respiratory virus also contribute respiratory disease . There also renew attention respiratory viruses previously consider benign , include human rhinovirus coronaviruses , mount evidence virus also lead clinically severe disease . Influenza one lead cause infectious related death hospitalization child 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic especially severe young population . Respiratory disease cause variety micro-organism especially virus . Despite frequency burden acute respiratory infection worldwide across age group , limit progress management treatment respiratory virus infection aside use anti-influenza drug . The ability prevent acute respiratory disease also limit except use influenza vaccine . The availability product use ease , low cost posse broad spectrum antimicrobial antiviral activity could play major role reduce overall occurrence , morbidity mortality associate acute respiratory disease . Moreover , upper respiratory infection lead cause outpatient illness U.S. military professional serve single great cause lose workdays military . Unfortunately , infection prevalent , also severe , constitute primary cause infectious disease hospitalization U.S. military personnel include Navy shipboard submarine personnel , new recruit basic training facility . Military trainee newly-mobilized troop particularly subject upper respiratory infection epidemic outbreak due crowd living condition , stress work environment , exposure respiratory pathogens disease-endemic area . Additionally , pulmonary disease result ubiquitous infection particularly impactful high altitude extreme environment common Air Force/Navy activity . Oasis Health Care develop technology product combine microbial barrier ability along broad spectrum anti-infective agent cetylpyridinium chloride ( CPC ) 0.1 % . This formulation call Halo commercially available over-the-counter treatment xerostomia . The spray formulation high mucoadhesion property prolong retention time oral cavity . Cetylpyridinium chloride like chlorhexidine quarternary ammonium salt . However , due posse certain advantage latter target pathogenic bacteria spar beneficial one ( see ) . Due chemical structure , CPC demonstrate significant antiviral activity especially respiratory virus ( see ) . Toxicology study show evidence acute chronic toxicity animal model irritant effect , over-the-counter mouthwash contain cetylpyridinium chloride market 45 year . Expanding indication use cetylpyridinium-based spray formulation ( Halo ) potential formulation prevent respiratory virus infection ( cold flu ) long term goal . This proposal examine effect Halo frequency duration clinically apparent acute respiratory infection respiratory virus burden measure PCR young healthy adult respiratory virus season Cleveland , Ohio . Selection enrollment participant Study Enrollment Withdrawal One hundred two healthy male female participant , age 18-45 enrolled two group . It estimate 204 subject need screen ( 2:1 screen eligible ) enroll 102 subject . At screening/enrollment , subject stratify whether receive inactivated live influenza virus vaccination . Subjects recruit customary IRB-approved method . Children , pregnant woman , prisoner vulnerable individual enrol . Clinical/Laboratory Evaluations Study Schedule Screening/Enrollment Written inform consent obtain clinical evaluation perform . As noted safety section : . study product acceptable safety profile pose significant toxicological risk individual . The formulation consist ingredient long history safe use oral healthcare product . A posterior pharyngeal nasal swab obtain ascertain baseline bacterial fungal organism multiplex PCR respiratory virus . Study product ( randomization ) provide next scheduled visit , study procedure review , contact information reach study personnel provide , study diary distribute . Appointments 1st monthly evaluation make . Scheduled Follow-up Visits At visit , interval medical concomitant medication history obtain . Solicited unsolicited adverse reaction ascertain . The study diary review participant . An oropharyngeal exam conduct study clinician fuller symptom-directed physical exam perform indicate . A posterior pharyngeal nasal swab obtain visit ascertain bacterial fungal organism multiplex PCR respiratory virus . The enrollment interim visit pharyngeal nasal swab analyse real time , swab store future use determine funding . Study bottle collect count . Study product provide next scheduled visit , study procedure review , contact information reach study personnel revisit . Appointments next monthly evaluation make . Final Study Visit This study visit conduct within 2 month complete last dose Halo/Placebo . At visit , interval medical concomitant medication history obtain . Solicited unsolicited adverse reaction ascertain . An oropharyngeal exam conduct study clinician fuller symptom-directed physical exam perform indicated . Interim Visits Subjects instruct contact study personnel event develop acute upper respiratory disease define within 72 hour onset symptom sign ( allow weekend holiday ) . At visit , interval medical concomitant medication history obtain . Solicited unsolicited adverse reaction ascertain . An oropharyngeal exam conduct study clinician fuller symptom-directed physical exam perform indicate . If pharyngitis exudate observe suspected , rapid group A streptococcal ( GAS ) screen perform . Subjects positive Group A streptococcal infection give prescription appropriate antibiotic referral follow-up care need . If individual present symptom sign acute influenza fever , sore throat , myalgia , headache chill , test influenza prescribed Tamiflu need . A posterior pharyngeal nasal swab obtain ascertain baseline bacterial fungal organism multiplex PCR respiratory virus . Any visit physician 's office , emergency department , urgent care center need hospitalization record . Subjects carefully instruct record duration symptom sign record study-supplied diary . Statistical Analysis Sample Size Calculations Initially , primary outcome control group vs. treatment group compare use t-test independent sample , technique use estimate sample size . Specifically , sample size calculation carry assume two group equal size random assignment balance . Further , assume average 2 event would occur control group , contrast average 1.5 event treat group ( SD = 1 ) , average duration illness would 4 day 3 day control treat group , respectively ( SD = 2 ) . Taking alpha 0.05 , sample size 23 per group would allow detection 25 % difference primary outcome two group 80 % power . The sample size increase 51 per group account potential loss follow-up . 29 Randomization Based whether enrol study participant receive type flu shot within past 3 month , participant classify influenza vaccine recipient non-recipients . Within category , randomly assign control group treatment group . The assignment balance equal number assign group . Interim Analysis The investigator carry interim analysis patient recruit follow one half month . Since pilot study , analysis carry stringent level significance . Statistical Analysis Standard technique descriptive statistic use compare demographic patient characteristic two treatment group . Since additional focus pilot study obtain accurate estimate moment distribution outcome variable , confidence interval also provide . Descriptive summary number event duration infection generate two group . As state , t-test use compare estimate average number event per person well average duration illness two group . To extent small sample size allows , investigator utilize regression technique count data , use SAS GENMOD , model number event per person adjust relevant covariates .</detailed_description>
