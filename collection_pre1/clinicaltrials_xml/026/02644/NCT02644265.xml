	<brief_summary>Detecting preserve consciousness brain-injured patient traditional clinical mean require presence motor function . Otherwise , patient may erroneously classify vegetative state . In order circumvent need motor function , paradigm use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) develop . According recent meta-analysis , 15 % patient clinical diagnosis vegetative state follow command perform mental imaginary task , strongly suggest indeed conscious . This utmost importance prognosis , treatment , resource allocation . However , consciousness paradigm usually employ rehabilitation medicine . Therefore , opportunity optimize patient outcome early stage may lose . As novel approach , CONsciousness NEurocritical Care cohorT study use fMRI EEG ( CONNECT-ME ) import full range consciousness paradigm neurocritical care . The investigator aim assess patient acute brain injury preserve consciousness serial multimodal evaluation use active , passive rest state fMRI- EEG-based paradigm . A prospective longitudinal database biobank genomic metabolomic research establish . This approach add essential clinical information , include detection preserve consciousness patient previously think unconscious . Due complexity , project divide nine work package . Eventually , investigator establish clinical service systematic assessment covert consciousness , well interdisciplinary research group dedicate neuronal mechanism consciousness recovers acute brain injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CONNECT-ME : Consciousness Neurocritical Care Cohort Study Using fMRI EEG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Searching consciousness non-communicating brain-injured patient clinical examination essential , yet challenge . The origin many clinical sign entirely clear significance whether patient conscious even less certain . In addition , consciousness may wax wane within second hour day month . Indeed , many 40 % patient disorder consciousness ( DoC ) misclassified vegetative state ( VS ) . Although patient may show sign consciousness clinical examination lose motor output , able willfully modulate brain activity command , occasionally even answer yes question perform mental imagery task . For patient acute brain injury caregiver , significant ethical practical implication , least prognostication , treatment decision , resource allocation end-of-life consideration . Technologies base functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) develop last two decade assist clinical evaluation patient VS minimal conscious state ( MCS ) . There three main approach test preserve consciousness : ( ) Active paradigm patient require execute cognitive task , outline , ( ii ) passive paradigm rely documentation preserve large-scale functional cortical connectivity , follow external stimulus , ( iii ) rest state condition assumptions patient 's conscious state make extrapolation pattern spontaneous brain activity . Consciousness paradigm offer excite opportunity far almost exclusively employed rehabilitation medicine , address patient chronic brain disorder , typically several year follow onset injury . Moreover , study mainly restrict spot assessment , take account consciousness fluctuate time . In addition , important methodological issue remain , include uncertainty specificity sensitivity different paradigm applicability brain disorder various etiology . Lastly , almost study employ either fMRI- EEG-based paradigm , although two modality necessarily yield identical result give patient rather complement . As investigator recently point review meta-analysis , systematic evaluation similarity differences technology essential , preferentially multimodal serial assessment . In present protocol , novel approach investigator focus evaluation consciousness patient acute phase brain injury . The aim establish , validate improve fMRI- EEG-based consciousness paradigm intensive care ( ICU ) step unit . This assist clinician precisely estimate level consciousness various acute disorder brain . The project comprise multidisciplinary approach include expertise neurology , clinical neurophysiology , anesthesiology functional neuroimaging . The investigator hypothesize serial multimodal assessment well reflect change level consciousness single unimodal evaluation . Within next two three year , investigator wish establish full clinical service fruitful research milieu cover entire spectrum fMRI- EEG-based consciousness paradigm acute brain injury . The ability identify preserve cognitive ability follow acute brain injury utmost importance improve diagnosis , guide therapeutic decision well predict outcome non-responsive patient . Eventually , present research project lead efficient decision make neurocritical care , thereby optimize resource allocation improve quality life survivor acute brain injury . Study Design : Due complexity , project divide 3 phase , include 9 work package . - During first phase project investigator aim set different part consciousness testing , , clinical rating scale ; fMRI-based active , passive rest state paradigm ; EEG-based active , passive rest state paradigm . This do step step pragmatic manner accord local requirement resource . To end , prospective , longitudinal database set , collect relevant clinical , neurophysiological imaging data , well biobank cerebrospinal fluid blood sample ( work package 1-7 ) . - During second phase project investigator wish combine diagnostic part implement simultaneously use convenience sample suitable non-communicating patient acute brain injury ( n=20 ) neurological neurosurgical ICU step unit , Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen University Hospital . These patient test presence preserve consciousness cognitive ability full range fMRI- EEG-based consciousness paradigm , well standardized bedside examination clinical rating scale ( work package 8 ) . - In third phase project investigator wish develop full clinical service evaluation patient DoC follow acute sub-acute brain injury , include comprehensive neurological evaluation fMRI- EEG-based consciousness paradigm , build infrastructure fruitful research activity future ( work package 9 ) . Detailed regularly updated procedure work package provide Amendments Study Protocol ( see ) . - Work package 1 ( rest state fMRI ; systematic clinical examination ) : The investigator start evaluate convenience sample DoC patient acute brain injury ( n=10 ) , admit ICU and/or neurological neurosurgical step unit Rigshospitalet , use rest state fMRI , since relevant protocol already available institution . A systems-level approach , include assessment auditory default mode network , use describe earlier . At time , investigator establish systematic clinical examination protocol , include - limited - Full Outline UnResponsiveness ( FOUR ) Coma Recovery Scale-Revised ( CRS-R ) . Exclusion criterion include contraindication examination MRI , severe cardiorespiratory compromise similar acutely life-threatening condition , evidence severe pre-morbid neurological deficit aphasia deafness , lack Danish English language proficiency , age le 16 year , patient without evidence intact primary auditory sensory cortex function reveal pretest screen brainstem auditory evoke potential ( BAEP ) somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEP ) . The investigator aim un-sedated patient ; however , patient wean sedation , level sedation lower low possible level order maximize chance detect presence consciousness . - Work package 2 ( clinical database ) : In order maximize learn effect present institution facilitate research , relevant clinical , neurophysiological imaging data collect comprehensive longitudinal database . Clinical outcome data assess , either telephone interview follow visit , use establish rating scale ( e.g . modify Rankin Scale ( mRS ) , Barthel index ) hospital discharge 3 , respectively , 12 month . Approval establish database distribute information derive mean scientific publication obtain accord current legislation Danish authority Datatilsynet ( The Danish Data Protection Agency ) Sundhedsstyrelsen ( The National Board Health ) . - Work package 3 ( active fMRI paradigm ) : The investigator establish active fMRI paradigm mean visual imaginary task ( play tennis , navigate familiar surround ) describe earlier , use similar convenience sample ( n=5-10 ) work package 1 . Patients clinically evaluate daily basis , include 30 min prior fMRI assessment , order capture fluctuation consciousness level accurately possible . Prior inclusion , patient examine brainstem auditory evoke potential ( BAEP ) somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEP ) order ensure intact primary auditory sensory cortex integrity . - Work package 4 ( passive fMRI paradigm ) : The investigator wish set passive fMRI paradigm use two oddball paradigm ( `` subject 's name '' , respectively , semantic ambiguity ) , assess patient ( n=5-10 ) clinically neurophysiologically ( BAEP , SSEP ) outline . - Work package 5 ( rest state EEG ) : In order correlate rest state EEG clinical outcome data , investigator assess historical EEG database , available Department Clinical Neurophysiology , Rigshospitalet , EEG complexity advance EEG measure follow acute brain injury 18 . - Work package 6 ( active EEG paradigm ) : Similar fMRI , investigator establish active EEG paradigm use visual imaginary task ( play tennis , navigate familiar surround ) describe earlier ( Cruse et al . 2011 ) . Clinical evaluation patient ( n=5-10 ) perform outline previously . - Work package 7 ( passive EEG paradigm ) : The investigator set passive EEG paradigm use oddball paradigm ( `` subject 's name '' , respectively , semantic ambiguity ) describe previously . As cognitive correlate accept P300 prolong evoked potential , well elaborate measure EEG complexity . Clinical evaluation patient ( n=5-10 ) perform previously describe . - Work package 8 ( consecutive sample assess full range fMRI- EEG-paradigms ) : In work package , correspond second phase project , investigator wish combine consciousness measure order systematically comprehensively evaluate consciousness acute brain injury patient , use full range clinical assessment well active , passive rest state fMRI- EEG-based paradigm . The investigator aim 20 consecutive TBI and/or non-TBI non-communicating DoC patient admit neurological neurosurgical ICU step unit ( inclusion criterion ) . Prior inclusion , primary auditory sensory cortex integrity verify use BAEP SSEP . Exclusion criterion include referred work package 1 . - Work package 9 ( full clinical service ; biobank ) : Once investigator show comprehensive fMRI- EEG-based consciousness paradigm feasible patient acute brain injury ICU intermediate care unit , wish establish full clinical service national referral center evaluation DoC patient follow acute brain injury .
