	<brief_summary>The purpose trial study compare two different anchorage technique . Adolescent patient need orthodontic treatment randomize Group A B . Both group treat extraction maxillary first premolar fix appliance . Anchorage reinforce miniscrews Group A molarblock Group B . The hypothesis : - miniscrews well anchorage capacity molarblock , - placement miniscrews cause pain discomfort tooth extraction , - molarblock provide increase anchorage - miniscrews cost-efficient conventional anchorage technique ,</brief_summary>
