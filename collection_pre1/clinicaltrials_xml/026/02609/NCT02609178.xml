	<brief_title>Basic Study Fabricating Biomorphic Crowns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For occlusal surface design , subject would give 3 crown use different fabricating guidance -- FGP technique ( FGP ) , average setting technique ( AVR ) conventional technique ( CON ) , separately . Upon baseline visit , general tooth preparation procedure would perform , include impression take treatment tooth preparation . Sometimes photo take need . On try-in visit , subject would ask fill questionaires ( Likert 's scale ) adjusting time crown would record . Moreover , t-scan would use assess occlusal equilibrium . All , include adjust visit FGP , subject visit clinic 3 time would take 3-week time . The Institutional Board ( IRB ) Stomatological Hospital Fourth Military Medical University ( FMMU ) would supervision whole study responsible quality assurance plan , data check source data verification . Subject recruitment would do within patient visit department prosthodontics Stomatological Hospital FMMU interest towards study . One clinician would appoint enroll subject accord standard . To avoid error , examination do study shall accomplish clinician crown fabricate study shall design technician . The clinician technician participate would receive adequate training study ensure performance . Every subject study assign inform consent begin study establish case report form ( CRFs ) . During study , adverse event ( crown chipping , crown drop iatrogenic gingivitis , etc ) happen , subject require contact investigator within 24 hour ; investigator report IRB within 24 hour . Following treatment compensation would do accord clause state informed consent sign subject . The whole study need subject total . During study , subject right quit study time discuss investigator advance . These subject deem `` unavailable '' . If subject n't contact investigator quit study ( investigator ca n't contact within follow-up period ) , record deem `` miss '' . All information collect study would protect use within study . The statistical analysis study would process aid department statistic FMMU .</detailed_description>
