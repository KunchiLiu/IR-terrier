	<brief_summary>Proximal humeral fracture incidence 4-5 % third common fracture elderly . Compared fracture upper limb second common fracture distal radial fracture . 65 % patient proximal humeral fracture old 60 year . Being aware demographic change even increase incidence fracture . Kannus et al . show incidence 298 per 100,000 least 80 year old patient 2007 . Palvanen et al . predict increase incidence 50 % 2030 . Approximately 80 % humeral fracture minimally non-displaced treat conservatively good functional result . In 20 % humeral fracture indication surgical treatment accord modify Neer-Criteria . These criterion fulfil angulation least 45 degree fracture fragment , displacement humeral shaft humeral head least 1 cm dislocation tuberculum least 5 mm . Up evidence superiority surgical treatment literature . At moment frequently use surgical technique treatment proximal humeral fracture angle stable plate fixation . There various publication concern topic publish investigator research group . In 10-years result majority patient show excellent good , also 16 % show unsatisfactory result lock plate fixation . Main risk poor outcome revision surgery cause secondary displacement ( 14 % ) also confirm result study . In study investigator could show high risk secondary displacement 2-part-fractures gross primary dislocation large metaphyseal fracture zone ( AO 11-A3 ) , especially osteoporotic patient . More common fracture problem surgical treatment . A secondary varus dislocation head fragment cutting-out common complication angle stable lock plate AO 11-A3 fracture elderly . The primary reason mechanism failure certain instability transmetaphyseal fracture region surgical neck cause loss impaction porous spongiosa . Because force head screw high call screw-bone-interface rather weak surgical treatment . Currently exist various approach avoid failure primary screw implantation . One possibility increase stability screw-bone-interface cement augmentation screw tip . To date exist clinical study report result lock plate fixation augmentation cannulate head screw although widely use method everyday surgery , especially elderly . A second possibility prevent secondary displacement surgical treatment 2-fragment-fractures use intramedullary nail . A development intramedullary nail multiplanar nail . Screws insert various different level direction lead clearly high stability . A comparison two treatment option augment lock plate versus multiplanar angle stable lock nail 2-part proximal humeral fracture carry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Because lack clinical study compare cement augment lock plate multiplanar humeral nail system 2-part proximal humeral fracture , decision surgical method currently depend surgeon favour . Because randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) sufficiently answer question one treatment option provide advantage compare method plan perform RCT . Investigators hypothesis : The cement augment angle stable plate fixation system PhilosTM augmentation ( Depuy-Synthes ) achieve significant difference concern intra- postoperative complication revision rate , functional outcome patient satisfaction compare multiplanar proximal MultiLoc®-Nail ( Depuy-Synthes ) term Disabilities Shoulder , Arm Hand-Score ( DASH ) Constant Score ( CS ) , American Shoulder Elbow Score ( ASES ) , Oxford Shoulder Score ( OSS ) , Range motion ( ROM ) Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) .</detailed_description>
