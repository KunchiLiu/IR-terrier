	<detailed_description>Surgical treatment breast cancer frequently associate postoperative pain surgical area , restrict movement ipsilateral upper limb increase risk chronic pain . This usually occur even though management analgesic commonly use postoperative period . Properly treatment acute postoperative pain essential implication : improve general welfare patient , good withstand future medical intervention , facilitate recovery short long term believe positive impact survival cancer . Persistent pain breast cancer management considerable negative effect quality life survivor . Several risk factor describe preoperative , intra-operative postoperative period persistent chronic pain . In postoperative period important risk factor severity acute pain . For , pain relief essential component care patient undergo breast cancer surgery . Current evidence suggest treatment acute postoperative pain reduces risk persistent chronic pain syndrome . The surgical wound infiltration local anesthesia use routinely patient manage Cancer Institute Clinica Las Americas describe safe accessible procedure management acute postoperative pain . Paravertebral block represent interest alternative management perioperative pain , often use breast surgery , hernia repair thoracotomy child adult . Although complication associate block uncommon , implementation Ultrasound-guided approach become standard performing say method . Such consideration lead u evaluate whether patient breast cancer undergo mastectomy , thoracic paravertebral block could better relief acute pain comparison surgical wound infiltration local anesthesia . This study control randomized one two intervention group ( paravertebral block local anesthesia infiltration surgical wound ) allocation trial . In patient , general anesthesia routine postoperative analgesic use .</detailed_description>
