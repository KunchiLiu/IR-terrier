	<detailed_description>This study assess serum potassium cardiac rhythm trend subject end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) 3 time weekly maintenance hemodialysis least 60 day . Approximately 240 Subjects meet eligibility criterion sign inform consent form enrol study , subject number assign . The number subject 3K high dialysate limit 60 , remainder subject 1K 2K dialysate . Baseline data collect include subject demographic , dialysis prescription , symptom assessment . In addition , result clinical laboratory test urea reduction ratio ( URR ) , dialyzer clearance-time-volume distribution urea ( Kt/V ) , intact parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) obtain within 4 week prior first dialysis treatment Study Day 1 collect regular monthly lab establish baseline . Subjects assess dialysis clinic/research center period 12 day . Subjects start study first day give week 's dialysis regimen ( ie , Monday Tuesday ) . Subjects Monday , Wednesday , Friday dialysis schedule skip Saturday visit , subject Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule skip Sunday visit 12-day study duration . Subjects undergo blood collection visit , include 6 dialysis day 5 inter-dialysis day . On dialysis day , blood sample collect immediately end dialysis treatment . During dialysis treatment Study Days 1 3 , additional blood sample obtain 30 minute 1 hour ( ± 15 minute ) start dialysis chemistry . On inter-dialysis day , dialysis clinic/research center make effort collect blood sample approximate time dialysis treatment would start day dialysis . Otherwise , sample may collect subject able visit dialysis clinic/research center . Vital sign include heart rate blood pressure , body weight collected visit . On dialysis day , pre- post-dialysis weight collect , along vital sign obtain dialysis . A specifically design symptom assessment also perform specify time throughout study . The subject also undergo cardiac rhythm monitor use non-invasive , Food Drug Administration clear , wearable device ( BodyGuardian® remote monitor system ) throughout 12 day participation study . This used ass cardiac arrhythmia , well correlate S-K level signal-averaged , processed ECG .</detailed_description>
