	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize neutrophil monocyte develop influence Interferon- gamma-1b ( IFN-γ-1b , Actimmune* ) vivo display enhance function across broad range activity relate large part transcriptional activation effect cytokine . The investigator evaluate effect IFN-γ healthy human subject vivo gene expression , biologic activity marker , functional activity myeloid cell single dose study steady state study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect IFN-γ Innate Immune Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Named potent ability interfere protect viral infection , interferon ( IFNs ) many regulatory effect immune system.1 Of member two class compound , IFN-γ diverse powerful immune effect . Studies mostly evaluate IFN-γ interaction cell adaptive immunity , include macrophage lymphocyte . Effects innate immunity , particularly polymorphonuclear leukocyte neutrophils monocyte less well study . However , investigation suggest IFN-γ may involve signal transduction , gene expression , respiratory burst neutrophil NADPH oxidase ( Nox2 ) activity , phagocytosis , motility , microbicidal activity , apoptosis . Not function enhance IFN-γ ; clinical use cytokine drive , part result . For example , primary motivation initiate investigation beneficial clinical effect Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) effect Nox2 activity.2 Most data area base study use differentiate neutrophils peripheral blood.1 However , phenotype neutrophil develop influence cytokine , change express exposure differentiate cell IFN-γ , critical understanding physiologic effect IFN-γ broad application use treatment range human disease . To expand understanding role IFN-γ development functional integrity neutrophil , investigator complete series study PLB-985 cell vitro culture system myeloid cell . In proposal , investigator evaluate innate immune activation phagocyte function healthy adult volunteer receive IFN-γ .</detailed_description>
