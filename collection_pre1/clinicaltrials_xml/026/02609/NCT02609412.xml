	<brief_summary>Latent myofascial trigger point ( LMTRP ) impair neuromuscular performance occur , patient asymptomatic subject . As evidence suggest LMTRP transform active trigger point , therapy seem warrant . Besides modality , self-massage use foam roller ( self-myofascial release ) apply treatment . However , data efficacy method concern LMTRP . Thus , present study aim evaluate effect different form self-myofascial release LMTRP pain . Healthy patient LMTRP calf randomly allocate one three group : 1 ) 90 static compression sensitive LMTRP mean foam roll , 2 ) dynamic self-myofascial release roll back forth calf muscle 90 use foam roller , 3 ) placebo laser acupuncture sensitive LMTRP . All subject participate familiarization session foam roller one week prior treatment . As outcome , pressure pain threshold assess algometer . The investigator hypothesize , static compression reduce pressure pain LMTRP effective dynamic self-myofascial release . The investigator expect placebo treatment least effective method .</brief_summary>
