	<brief_title>Assessment Immediate Adverse Reactions From Dotarem Children Under 2 Years Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our primary outcome ass safety Dotarem patient 24 hour Dotarem injection . The patient monitor hospital least 2 hour follow completion MRI exam . Many patient receive sedation MRI would monitor normally 1 hour exam complete . Patients monitor adverse event occur observation period . The type event , time onset , duration symptom , intensity reaction ( mild , moderate , severe ) , causality ( relate , probably relate , relate , definitely relate , unclassifiable ) , subsequent outcome ( require treatment , favorable outcome , recovery sequela , death ) document . Parents give information sheet prior discharge indicate possible adverse event may occur related administration Dotarem instruction call , necessary , occur . Parents call radiology department next day identify adverse event occur first 24 hour discharge hospital . Our secondary outcome ass image quality exam . The pre-contrast image compare combined pre- post-contrast image follow administration Dotarem radiologist blind patient ' clinical information ass improvement image quality delineation structure contrast . 200 patient expect enrolled study course 18 month . Exclusion criterion : Patients 2 year age old . Patients receive MRI exam without contrast . Patients GFR &lt; 30 . Patients know renal failure prior gadolinium base contrast agent hypersensitivity reaction . Patients receive MRI exam use different gadolinium-based contrast agent . Patients accompanied parent include . Patients unable complete MRI exam prior contrast administration exclude . Inclusion criterion : Any patient 2 year age undergoing MRI exam neuraxis body without contrast part standard care . Included patient may schedule simultaneous sedation MRI . Nonsedated patient also qualify study . Patients qualify Dotarem administration usually preselected radiologist depend type exam reason study . While , use Dotarem approve FDA patient population , off-label use agent routinely perform routine clinical care patient age group practice . Those patient would give Dotarem part routine standard care ask enroll . Written consent obtain parent . Patients recruit 18 month period time . All MRI exam perform 3T GE Discovery 750W 1.5T GE Signa HDXT 23.0 . All patient follow information record : age , sex , weight , risk factor ( renal disease , cardiac disease , autoimmune disease , dehydration , medical condition ) , reason exam , type exam , dose Dotarem , route injection ( manual power injection ) , premedication regimen ( i.e . steroid ) , tolerance injection . In addition , applicable , types medication use sedation record well route sedation : deep sedation , laryngeal mask airway , general endotracheal anesthesia . Patients give weight-based dose Dotarem 0.2mL/kg ( 0.1 mmol/kg ) body weight . It administer intravenous bolus injection flow rate approximately 1-2 mL/second either manual power injection . During MRI exam , patient undergo continuous monitor heart rate peripheral oxygen saturation . Sedated patient monitor similarly reach Aldrete score &gt; 6 . After monitor device remove . The patient observe monitor total 2 hour exam elapse . All adverse drug event ( ADEs ) document include nausea , headache , injection site pain , injection site coldness , burn sensation , heart arrhythmia , allergic reaction ( cardiac respiratory arrest , laryngeal edema , angioedema , urticarial , seizure , syncope , tremor , muscle spasm weakness , diarrhea , drool , fever . If ADE occur , time relate injection Dotarem record . A crash cart available directly across hallway MRI suite Sedation/Nursing area radiology . Nursing staff staff radiologist available time immediate reaction . If severe anaphylactic bronchospasm reaction occur , patient bring Emergency Department . Management treatment acute reaction contrast medium follow guideline outline Table 4 ACR Manual Contrast Media Version 10.1 ( 2015 ) . Aldrete Scoring System : Activity Voluntary movement limb command 2 Voluntary movement 2 extremity command 1 Unable move 0 Respiration Able breathe deeply cough 2 Dyspnea , hypoventilation 1 Apnea 0 Circulation B/P + 20 % pre-anesthetic level 2 B/P + 20 % -50 % pre-anesthetic level 1 B/P + 50 % pre-anesthetic level 0 Consciousness Fully awake 2 Arousable 1 Unresponsive 0 Color Pink 2 Pale , dusky , blotchy , jaundice , 1 Cyanotic 0 Phone Call : The follow phone call parent next day ( &gt; 24 hour ) include ask parent follow question : Did child experience follow discharge hospital MRI exam ? Headache Y/N Nausea Y/N Dizziness Y/N Dysgeusia Y/N Feeling Hot Y/N Injection site reaction Y/N Vomiting Y/N Rash ( include generalize , macular , popular , pruritic ) Y/N Erythema Y/N Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactoid ( i.e . urticarial , facial edema , eyelid edema , flushing , cough , sneezing , wheeze , chest pain , cyanosis ) Y/N Dyspnea Y/N Paresthesia Y/N Following child 's discharge MRI , he/she clinic appointment tests/exams hospital ? If , ? Our secondary outcome ass image quality exam . Patients initially undergo pre-contrast MRI examination follow administration Dotarem . The pre-contrast image compare combined pre- post-contrast image independently 3 radiologist blind clinical information . The three primary image component judge contrast enhancement , border delineation , internal morphology . In addition , within component , radiologist assign result base pre-defined score scale . These include follow : Pre-contrast image vs. Paired pre-post contrast image : Border delineation : better , , good , miss Internal morphology : better , , good , miss Contrast enhancement : better , , good , miss Better define patient combined pre- post-contrast exam image great pre-contrast image alone . Same define patient characteristic lesion disease change follow contrast administration inherent characteristic lesion/disease enhancement expect . Missing identifies patient score assign .</detailed_description>
