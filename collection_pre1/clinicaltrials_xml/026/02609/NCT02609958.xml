	<brief_summary>This single arm , multicentre , Phase 2 study ass efficacy safety ASLAN001 patient advance metastatic cholangiocarcinoma progress least 1 line systemic therapy . 25 evaluable patient enrol study . After evaluation initial response first 10 evaluable patient , Sponsor make decision recruitment additional 15 evaluable patient . If response observe , study stop . The primary objective ass efficacy varlitinib ( also know ASLAN001 ) measure ORR ( base RECIST v1.1 ) . The secondary objective ( 1 ) evaluate efficacy varlitinib , measure DoR , PFS , OS DCR , ( 2 ) ass ORR , DoR , PFS , DCR OS tumor EGFR/HER2 status , ( 3 ) ass safety tolerability ASLAN001 monotherapy . Exploratory objectives explore possible relationship response ASLAN001 protein expression level gene mutational status proteins gene via IHC PCR/Sequencing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ASLAN001 Patients With Advanced Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma Who Progressed Least 1 Line Systemic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) malignancy arise biliary epithelium characterize poor prognosis poor response current treatment . Emerging portion biliary tree , include group tumours epidemiologic , morphologic , biologic , clinical heterogeneity . Despite recent medical advance , long-term outcome recurrence rate CCA poor . The 5-year survival rate follow surgical resection 11-40 % . Tumour recurrence rate high 50-65 % , median time recurrence 12-43 month . In United States , incidence mortality CCA increase last 30 year without clear underlying etiological reason . The curative therapy surgical ; however option many patient give stage disease presentation metastasis . While improvement diagnostic modality neoadjuvant chemotherapy allow detection earlier stage great survival rate , prognosis still unfavorable . Therapies decrease tumour growth , improve resection outcome , increase survival rate , decrease recurrence would make great impact quality life CCA patient urgently need . Currently , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved agent use unresectable CCA include gemcitabine , capecitabine , cisplatin , oxaliplatin , fluoropyrimidines ( include 5-fluorouracil ) , combination . However , none FDA-approved primarily use CCA specifically . Gemcitabine cisplatin combination therapy , along fluoropyrimidine-based gemcitabine-based regimen part guideline unresectable cancer per National Comprehensive Cancer Network . To date , effective chemotherapy regimen administration gemcitabine cisplatin oxaliplatin , become standard care systemic therapy . Even efficacious treatment find modestly increase overall survival ( 11.7 month vs 8.3 month patient receive gemcitabine alone ) progression-free survival ( 8.4 vs 6.5 month ) . Standard treatment second-line chemotherapy CCA unclear significant evidence specific therapy indicate chemotherapy beyond progression first-line chemotherapy improve survival . CCA involve mutation member ErbB family , include EGFR HER2 mutation . EGFR overexpressed intrahepatic extrahepatic CCA ( 30.8 % 20.9 % , respectively ) independent prognostic factor intrahepatic case , per Yang et al 2014 . While study find overexpression HER2 exclusively extrahepatic sample ( 4.5 % ) , previous study implicate protein extra- intrahepatic tumour . Settakorn et al ( 2005 ) show HER2 expression correlate high histological grade intrahepatic CCA . Kim et al . ( 2007 ) find HER2 ( gene protein level ) overexpressed approximately 30 % extrahepatic CCA patient prognostic factor survival lymph node metastasis . EGFR , HER2 , HER4 single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein receptor , member type I receptor tyrosine kinase family . Upon ligand binding , activation induces homo- heterodimerization subsequent phosphorylation intracellular tyrosine , lead cell proliferation survival therefore cancer development progression . EGFR HER2 inhibitor demonstrate clinical efficacy cancer treatment . The simultaneous inhibition represent new therapeutic approach broadly target different tumour type may effective selective inhibition receptor . Varlitinib , also know ASLAN001 potent , orally active inhibitor receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor ( EGFR ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 4 ( HER2 , HER4 ) . In cell-based assay , varlitinib show potently inhibit phosphorylation EGFR , HER2 , HER4 dose-dependent manner . In cell line overexpressing HER2 , varlitinib also inhibit phosphorylation HER2 downstream effector AKT . ASLAN hypothesise varlitinib inhibit EGFR , HER2 , HER4 mutation result CCA , thus turn inhibit growth cancerous cell development/progression . ASLAN believe varlitinib compound may beneficial patient cancer simultaneous inhibition receptor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must advance ( unresectable ) metastatic , intra extra hepatic adenocarcinoma originate bile duct . Histologicallyconfirmed diagnosis require first 10 evaluable patient . The following patient could confirm histologically cytologically . Patients must disease progression fail least 1 line systemic drug regimen advance cholangiocarcinoma due disease progression intolerance . Presence radiographically measurable disease base RECIST v1.1 . No evidence biliary duct obstruction , unless obstruction control local treatment , biliary tree decompress endoscopic percutaneous stenting subsequent reduction bilirubin 1.5 x upper level normal ( ULN ) . Patients respective country 's legal age old time write informed consent . Patients Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Patient must able understand willing sign inform consent form donate tumour tissue ( archival fresh ) evaluation relevant exploratory endpoint . The first 10 evaluable patient need adequate archival tissue exploratory objective . Patient adequate organ hematological function : Hematological function , follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Renal function , follow : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN eGFR &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 Hepatic function , follow : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ALT ≤ 5 x ULN Patient radiation local treatment within past 6 week target lesion ( ) . Patients major surgical procedure within 21 day prior study entry . Patient brain lesion , know brain metastasis ( unless previously treat well controlled period least 3 month ) . Patient malabsorption syndrome , diseases significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel , difficulty swallow retain oral medication . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , diabetes , hypertension , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients history malignancy unless remission 1 year . ( Nonmelanoma skin carcinoma carcinomainsite uterine cervix treat curative intent exclusionary ) . Female patient pregnant breast feed . Patients previously treat Varlitinib . Patients receive investigational drug ( use investigational device ) within last 14 day receive first dose study medication . Patient unresolved unstable serious toxicity ( ≥ CTCAE 4.03 Grade 2 ) prior administration another investigational drug and/or prior cancer treatment . Patients known history HIV , decompensated cirrhosis , chronic hepatitis B HBV DNA &gt; 2000 IU/ml persistent abnormal ALT past 6 month , chronic hepatitis C persistent abnormal ALT past 6 month . Known History drug addiction within last 1 year . Patients need continuous treatment proton pump inhibitor study period . Any history presence clinically significant cardiovascular , respiratory , hepatic , renal , hematologic , gastrointestinal , endocrine , immunologic , dermatologic , neurologic psychiatric disease condition opinion Investigator could jeopardize safety patient validity study result .
