Clinical study compare haptic design yield controversial result regard position stability capsular bag , recommend site IOL fixation uneventful cataract surgery . Most previous study measure IOL position base Purkinje reflection . The measurement time-consuming patient reluctant cooperate image acquisition . Purkinje measurement detect anterior chamber depth ( ACD ) reveal IOL position along axis . Clinical Scheimpflug system base rotate Scheimpflug imaging , hand , able acquire sufficient 3-dimensioinal data point within reasonably short period , usually second . It show system one best method estimate IOL position . To good compare intracapsular stability single-piece 3-piece IOLs , investigator measure IOL position rotate Scheimpflug image system test visual quality patient implanted IOLs .</detailed_description>
