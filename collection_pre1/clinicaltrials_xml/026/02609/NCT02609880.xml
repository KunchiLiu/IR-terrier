	<detailed_description>Gynecologic cancer cause substantial morbidity mortality among woman . Developing , implementing , disseminate intervention reduce morbidity mortality secondary gynecologic cancer public health priority . To extent psychological factor may influence quality life tumor biology among woman gynecologic cancer , psychological intervention may represent important adjunct standard clinical care population . Among individual cancer , emerge evidence stressor psychological response stressor activate central peripheral stress system , result downstream effect tumor microenvironment , e.g . hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis dysregulation , inflammatory/growth factor upregulation may favor tumorigenesis . Little known whether psychological intervention may modulate biobehavioral factor may promote tumorigenesis among woman gynecologic cancer . This significant gap literature . Sleep quality , pain , mood three patient-centered outcome may represent important intervention target woman gynecologic cancer , insomnia , pain , negative mood state ( 1 ) prevalent ( 2 ) associate HPA dysregulation inflammatory/growth factor upregulation population empirical research . This study examine cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) intervention effect patient center physiological outcome among woman gynecologic cancer undergo adjuvant chemotherapy . Grounded within Central Arousal Theory Stress ( CATS ) biobehavioral model tumor biology , central hypothesis CBT intervention target insomnia pain ( ) improve nighttime sleep pattern , pain , negative mood state , ( b ) reduce cortisol level , normalize daytime cortisol rhythm , reduce proinflammatory/proangiogenic cytokine level woman gynecologic cancer . The multidisciplinary team research/clinical experience psycho-oncology , psychoneuroimmunology ( PNI ) , behavioral sleep medicine , pain , reproductive immunology , gynecologic oncology . The research study innovative ( 1 ) combine empirically-supported CBT technique insomnia pain multicomponent intervention tailor woman gynecologic cancer , ( 2 ) examine CBT effect central sensitization pain among individual cancer use quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) . The result research significant public health initiative , although gynecologic cancer among leading cause cancer-related death among woman , paucity research examine effect psychosocial intervention patient-centered physiological outcome population .</detailed_description>
