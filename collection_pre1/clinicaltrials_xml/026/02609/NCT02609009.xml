	<brief_summary>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) affect 2 - 3 % child adolescent older 10 year unknown cause . It initially think back pain ( BP ) occurrence similar one encounter healthy adolescent . Recently though , literature show BP seem occur twice often healthy adolescent 's . As , BP appear condition might detrimental effect well-being population , , investigator know , associated increase healthcare cost . Of interest , BP adolescent would appear predictive factor adult BP . Is vertebral manipulation ( VM ) viable alternative ? Since 2006 , four guideline agreement value approach acute chronic BP adult . Unfortunately , study find adolescent . The purpose investigator study verify VM efficacious improve AIS patient ' back pain find help patient obtain good quality life improve spinal flexibility . Recruitment take place Ste-Justine 's hospital patient 2 evaluation , conduct independent orthopaedist ( baseline 4 week ) . Patients allocate either experimental ( VM ) usual medical care group . Spinal manipulation treatment spin 4-week period . The investigator study first trial evaluate efficacy vertebral manipulation adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patient back pain . Finally , study find available effective treatment regard back pain management population . A well-structured trial need provide clinician well understand best evidence regard treatment protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis ( AIS ) define Scoliosis Research Society ( SRS ) three-dimensional deviation vertebral column unknown origin appear adolescent old 10 year . Chronic non-specific back pain ( CNSBP ) often associate adolescent scoliosis patient associate prevalence almost double non-scoliosis healthy adolescent . Furthermore , CNSBP seem predictor CNSBP adulthood . Few study evaluate BP among AIS patient , conflict result , regard back pain prevalence , observe . Among , two study look back pain adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . Ramirez et al . retrospectively evaluate , 2442 scoliosis adolescent patient ' file establish BP prevalence 32 % . He conclude establish prevalence similar one encounter general non-scoliotic adolescent population . Joncas Labelle prospectively evaluate 239 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis prevalence BP . They observe BP present 54 % patient , average pain intensity 49,4 mm . More recently , Sato 's look back pain prevalence adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . He conduct large-scale cross-sectional epidemiological study , 43 630 child age 9 15-year-old ask complete take-home questionnaire . They report back pain prevalence 58.8 % scoliosis patient compare 32.9 % non-scoliosis patient . In regard BP Management AIS Patients , comprehensive review literature yield study BP management AIS patient . Spinal manipulation therapy ( SMT ) recognize safe therapy low back pain perform primarily chiropractor , physical therapist , osteopath . To best investigator knowledge , one pilot clinical trial conduct among child adolescent even musculoskeletal disorder frequent condition treat , population , chiropractor . This pilot trial report minor adverse event though 120 spinal manipulation deliver curve progression report intervention group . In light paucity literature management back pain nonsurgical AIS patient consider lack evidence regard efficacy SMT back pain adolescent , lack guidance regard management back pain adolescent , would important evaluate effectiveness SMT compare usual medical care back pain among adolescent idiopathic nonsurgical scoliosis . The primary objective pilot study verify effect Spinal Manipulative Therapy back pain management adolescent idiopathic nonsurgical scoliosis . The secondary objective two-fold : 1 ) verify effect SMT low back function , 2 ) verify feasibility acceptability SMT accord patient ' level satisfaction . This pilot study also serve verify implementation strategy proceed subsequent large trial recruitment rate , treatment compliance loss follow , adverse event occurrence ( appendix E ) . Methods : Study Design This pilot study prospective single centre randomize control trial one experimental one control group . This study recruit Ste-Justine University Hospital Montreal , Canada , patient require attend least 80 % treatment session otherwise consider non-compliant . Chiropractors recruit professional regulatory board . Different questionnaires instrument employ trial : questionnaire ; Brief Pain Inventory Questionnaire , Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire ; Instruments : modify Fingertip-to-floor distance , modified-modified Schöber test , Biering-Sorenson back muscle extensor test . Patients evaluate upon trial entry 4 week ( end trial ) . Any co-interventions document accounted analysis . Eligible patient randomize accord block 4 either experimental ( SMT ) control ( UMC ) arm inform consent obtain . The randomization list generate managed independent statistician . Statistical software SPSS version 22 use data analysis . All analysis conduct intention-to-treat principle . To ensure balance , group compare respect possible confounders ( age , gender , brace etc . ) baseline . Means ( Std . Deviation ) frequency present group . Tests 2-tailed significance level set 0.05 . Statistical analysis include t-test ( Mann-Whitney ) continuous variable χ2 categorical variable . Considering patient 's inclusion criterion chronic pain , definition , chronic pain define constant period time ; investigator expect variable time influence . Ste-Justine University Hospital ethical committee approve study .</detailed_description>
