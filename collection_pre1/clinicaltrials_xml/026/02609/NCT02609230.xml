	<brief_title>A Dose-Escalation Study Onc201 Administered Every One Three Weeks Advanced Solid Tumors Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) ONC201 , give single agent , patient advance solid tumor multiple myeloma , two dose schedule include every 3 week weekly . For first arm ( A ) , dose escalation use follow single patient dose-escalation cohort base 'Design 4 ' propose Simon colleague : 125 , 250 , 500 , 625 mg . Following completion Arm A dose escalation , subsequent cohort test minimum 3 patient . The Arm B dose cohort consist dose level administer every one week ( plan dose 250 , 375 , 500 625 mg ) . Dependent PK PD data , emerge efficacy data , additional dose level Arm A Arm B may explore . For Arm A , single patient cohort use first instance DLT second instance grade 2 toxicity . Either occurrence lead immediate use modify 3+3 design ~40 % dose increment . Arm B use 3 + 3 design cohort . It anticipate 16 - 48 evaluable patient dose escalation additional 17 patient expansion phase enrol study course 2 year . Patients receive ONC201 3-week cycle disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient discontinues reason . The maximum duration treatment 12 month unless determine patient would derive benefit continued therapy beyond 12 month .</detailed_description>
