The total duration program eight week . During time participant ask keep brief daily log activity break workday . At end 8-week program participant return laboratory repeat health assessment . ASSESSMENTS : All participant complete follow test procedure : - Metabolic blood panel . Blood drawn quick finger stick ass total cholesterol , triglyceride , LDL , HDL , fast glucose . - DEXA scan . Participants lie body scanner 10 minute assess body composition . - Body measurement . A trained research assistant measure height , weight , waist circumference . - Blood pressure . A trained research assistant measure blood pressure use automate blood pressure cuff . In addition , participant complete follow assessment outside laboratory : - Questionnaires : Participants ask complete series questionnaire . This take 15-20 minute . - Accelerometer : Participants ask wear motion sensor total 21 day ( three 7-day period ) . This small apparatus wear around waist day .
