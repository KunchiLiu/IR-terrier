	<brief_summary>Lower extremity ulcer pose significant clinical , humanistic economic burden society . Millions Americans afflict painful , open , drain sore low extremity . These sore refer venous leg ulceration ( VLUs ) .1-5 Under best circumstance ulcer require week month heal . Not uncommonly wound care specialist see patient suffer year face amputation limb option alleviate pain . Standard care result heal 50 % venous leg ulcer 12 week . However , roughly half patient suffer venous ulcer require advanced therapy . Human amniotic membrane replaces damage extracellular matrix characteristic chronic ulcer . In addition , contain cytokine may accelerate healing . In clinical practice recent study , Dehydrated Human Amniotic Membrane appear effective bioengineered skin product . This RCT design evaluate Amnioband Dehydrated Human Amniotic Membrane venous leg ulcer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amnioband Standard Care vs. Standard Care Alone Treatment Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multi-center , randomize , trial design evaluate safety effectiveness Amnioband Dehydrated Human Amniotic Membrane plus multi-layer compression therapy versus multi-layer compression alone heal venous leg ulcer . The Standard Care therapy study multi-layer compression therapy . A number compression bandage system commercially available . The choice compression discretion principle investigator . The Screening Phase ( 1-14 day ) consist series screen assessment design determine eligibility follow , meet eligibility criterion ( describe detail ) , At 14 day first Screening Period Visit ( S1 ) , write informed consent subject obtain Investigator suitably qualify designee performance protocol-specific procedure . Subjects treated compression therapy target ulcer must receive minimum 14 day compression prior enrollment . At first Screening Period Visit ( S1 ) , Investigator select study ( target ) ulcer . Each subject one VLU select study ( target ) ulcer . In situation subject one VLU S1 visit , Investigator select large VLU meet eligibility criterion protocol study ( target ) ulcer . The Screening Period design determine whether subject eligible proceed Treatment Period study . The Treatment Phase ( 12 Weeks ) begin series assessment design confirm subject ' continue eligibility . Subjects continue meet eligibility criterion randomize one three group : ( 1 ) standard care : multi-layer compression ( 2 ) weekly application Amnioband Dehydrated Human Amniotic Membrane ( 3 ) biweekly application Amnioband Dehydrated Human Amniotic Membrane . During Treatment Phase , subject evaluated weekly basis . Efficacy evaluation week include Investigator assessment ulcer heal measurement ulcer size use digital camera device . Safety evaluation Treatment Phase consist adverse event assessment visit . Subjects three group whose ulcer achieve closure 12 week deem treatment failure . Subjects control arm may cross Amnioband arm fail achieve closure although subject include analysis .</detailed_description>
