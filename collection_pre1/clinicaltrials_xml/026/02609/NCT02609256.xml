	<brief_summary>Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction ( MMCI ) high rate disability mortality . At present , effective treatment except craniotomy decompression , controversy craniotomy decompression still exist . The project prospective , randomize , single center , open label , clinical control trail . The eligible patient enrollment follow : ( 1 ) malignant cerebral artery infarction within 48h onset ; ( 2 ) craniotomy decompression perform due contraindication , refuse patient relative . The patient randomly assign 2 group : ( 1 ) Medical therapy group : receiving osmotic therapy mannitol glycerol fructose，anti-platelet treatment , statin , symptomatic treatment control blood pressure , blood sugar , infection , tracheal intubation incision , etc ; ( 2 ) Stereotactic infarct tissue aspiration ( SITA ) group : basis medical treatment , receive minimally invasive aspiration infarct tissue 24-48 hour stroke attack . This study aim compare efficacy safety SITA patient MMCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction ( MMCI ) fatality rate 80 % , due massive brain edema , increase intracranial pressure , cerebral herniation . The herniation-induced death usually occur first week , despite aggressive osmotherapy mannitol hypertonic saline , sedation , eventually hyperventilation , buffer , hypothermia . A grow evidence show decompression craniectomy ( DC ) produce significant reduction mortality rate improvement neurological outcome , controversy DC still exist . There urgent need find effective treatment method . Given brain tissue necrosis-induced edema cerebral herniation key reason fatality disability MMCI patient , investigator argue reduction cerebral tissue volume stereotactic infarct tissue aspiration ( SITA ) likely reach decompression effect similar DC . Recently , investigator perform SITA 2 MMCI patient qualify decompressive craniectomy , refuse patient relative , neurological function significantly improve . The project prospective , randomize , single center , open label , clinical control trail . The eligible patient enrollment follow : ( 1 ) age 40 90 year old ; ( 2 ) malignant cerebral artery infarction within 48h onset ; ( 3 ) craniotomy decompression perform due contraindication , refuse patient relative . The patient randomly assign 2 group : ( 1 ) Medical therapy group : receiving osmotic therapy mannitol glycerol fructose，anti-platelet treatment , statin , symptomatic treatment control blood pressure , blood sugar , infection , tracheal intubation incision , etc ; ( 2 ) SITA group : receiving minimally invasive aspiration infarct tissue 24-48 hour stroke attacked basis medical treatment . This study aim compare efficacy safety SITA patient MMCI .</detailed_description>
