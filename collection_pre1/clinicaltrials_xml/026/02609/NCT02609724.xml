	<brief_title>Effectiveness Fluoroscopy-guided MLD Treatment BCRL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According International Society Lymphology , lymphoedema need treat Decongestive Lymphatic Therapy ( Consensus Document ISL 2013 ) . This two-stage treatment programme . During first intensive phase , lymphoedema maximally reduce . This phase consist skin care , manual lymph drainage ( MLD ) , multi-layer bandaging exercise therapy . The second maintenance phase aim conserve optimise result obtain first phase . It consist skin care , compression low-stretch elastic sleeve , exercise lymph drainage . Skin care , multi-layer bandaging , elastic sleeve exercise treatment modality ( instruct patient ) perform patient . MLD apply physical therapist hence entail big financial cost patient Health Care ( KÃ¤rki et al 2009 ) . The effectiveness MLD apply intensive phase investigate 5 randomise control trial , conflict evidence . So , investigation warrant determine relative benefit MLD . The effectiveness MLD apply maintenance phase never investigate ( Devoogdt et al 2010 , Oremus et al 2012 , Huang et al 2013 , Ezzo et al 2015 ) . A possible explanation MLD obviously proven effective , MLD apply inefficient way : MLD , hand manoeuvre apply lymph node lymphatics may anatomically present . After axillary dissection and/ radiotherapy ( treatment breast cancer ) , lymphatic system damage : lymph node remove often fibrosis superficial lymphatic system occur . As result , rerouting lymphatic drainage occur . Rerouting patient-specific , consequently , possible traditional MLD need abandon tailored approach need establish . Lymphofluoroscopy aid apply efficient MLD . During lymphofluoroscopy , fluorescent substance inject subcutaneously hand visualizes transport lymph hand axilla demonstrate alternative pathway towards lymph node . A second explanation traditional method MLD proven effective , research show MLD high pressure ( vs low pressure ) effective improve lymph transport , well glide ( v glide ) . During new method MLD ( fluoroscopy-guided MLD ) , therapist performs hand movement functional lymphatics lymph node . In addition , hand movement apply high pressure lymph transport lymph collateral stimulate apply strike across skin . Therefore , main scientific objective entail examine effectiveness fluoroscopy-guided MLD versus traditional MLD versus placebo MLD , apply part intensive maintenance phase Decongestive Lymphatic Therapy , treatment BCRL</detailed_description>
