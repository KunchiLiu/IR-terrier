	<brief_title>Manual Therapy After Ankle/Hindfoot Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study enroll 76 subject stiffness ankle and/or hindfoot fracture . Stiffness define study ankle lunge test . This test measure dorsiflexion ( DF ) weight bear position , side-to-side difference &gt; 5.0 centimeter ( cm ) use criterion determine ankle stiffness great three time small real difference 1.38 cm . Potential subject recruit either orthopedic surgeon PI must satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion . Those individual meet eligibility criterion agree participate sign inform consent appropriate Internal Review Board ( IRB ) undergo baseline assessment . The baseline assessment perform clinician blind subject 's treatment group assignment . Participants randomize receive manual therapy ( MT ) control group ( CONTROL ) base list generate computer program sequentially number place seal envelope baseline measure complete . Participants give chance practice functional test prior baseline assessment , chance rest need . The order test administer randomize computer generate process . Participants ask perform follow test : single limb stance ( average 3 trial ) , Star excursion balance test ( anterior , posteromedial , posterolateral direction ) ( average 3 trial ) , ankle lunge test ( ALT ) , foot assessment platform , MyotonPRO walk across GAITRite mat . Patients perform test without shoe order standardize footwear subject , test perform affected unaffected side . After baseline measure take , participant randomize either MT Control Group . Participants manual therapy group receive joint mobilization participant control group receive sham manual therapy treatment consist soft tissue mobilization Grade I mobilizations proximal tib/fib joint . Treatment manual therapy group base physical therapist 's clinical decision make fellowship train manual therapy . For instance , patient talar neck fracture lack dorsiflexion , therapist may choose avoid anterior-posterior talocrural joint mobilization may place increased stress talar neck mobilize instead talonavicular joint and/or subtalar joint base stiffness . After receive treatment , participant perform test measure random order , allow rest much need . The amount time need rest test document . Participants return 2 additional follow visit 7 10 day initial examination measurement ; however , ask fill self-reported questionnaire perform test measure second treatment . Participants follow 7-10 day last manual therapy treatment final measurement test measure . Participants control group ask follow-up time point manual therapy group initial baseline measure ask complete questionnaire test time point manual therapy group . Subjects ask avoid practice balance beginning exercise normal activity daily live time . Specific Aim 1 : To evaluate manual therapy improve range motion , muscle stiffness , patient ankle stiffness ankle/hindfoot fracture control group . The dependent variable Aim1 weight bear dorsiflexion range motion ( ROM ) , foot mobility , muscle stiffness . The independent variable Aim1 treatment group ( MT v CONTROL ) time . The primary aim examine use linear mixed model repeat measure account correlation among repeated observation patient . Time ( baseline , assessment 1 assessment 2 ) treatment group ( MT CONTROL ) model fixed effect , ALT primary dependent variable ( DV ) . Separate model construct similar fashion foot mobility magnitude ( FMM ) muscle stiffness DV . The hypothesis interest group-by-time interaction . Treatment effect calculate between-group difference change score baseline assessment 1 assessment 2 . Specific Aim 2 : To evaluate patient receive three manual therapy treatment great improvement spatial temporal gait parameter control group . The dependent variable Aim 2 gait velocity stance time . The independent variable Aim 2 treatment group ( MT v CONTROL ) time . The primary aim examine use linear mixed model repeat measure account correlation among repeated observation patient . Time ( baseline , assessment 1 assessment 2 ) treatment group ( MT CONTROL ) model fixed effect , gait velocity primary dependent variable ( DV ) . A separate model construct similar fashion stance time DV . The hypothesis interest group-by-time interaction . Treatment effect calculate between-group difference change score baseline assessment 1 assessment 2 . Specific Aim 3 : To evaluate patient receive three manual therapy treatment great improvement balance control group . The dependent variable Aim3 distance reach star excursion balance test single limb stance time . The independent variable Aim3 treatment group ( MT v CONTROL ) time . The primary aim examine use linear mixed model repeat measure account correlation among repeated observation patient . Time ( baseline , assessment 1 assessment 2 ) treatment group ( MT Control ) model fixed effect , distance reach star excursion balance test ( SEBT ) primary dependent variable ( DV ) . A separate model construct similar fashion single limb stance time DV . The hypothesis interest group-by-time interaction . Treatment effect calculate between-group difference change score baseline assessment 1 assessment 2 .</detailed_description>
