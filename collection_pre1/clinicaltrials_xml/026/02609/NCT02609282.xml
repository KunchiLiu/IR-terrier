	<brief_title>The Impact Hourly Prompts Reducing Prolonged Sitting Work</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The health benefit physical activity widely recognise increase evidence show detrimental effect sedentary behaviour health . Both total sedentary time temporal pattern accumulation sedentary behaviour significant effect health , prolong , unbroken period sit harmful . Working adult spend considerable proportion time work domain high level prolong sedentary behaviour many workplace . There limited evidence small-scale study workplace intervention reduce prolonged sedentary behaviour office worker . Providing advice stand regular interval work day use passive computer-based prompt , significantly reduce prolonged sit 40 minute per day increase self-reported energy expenditure . This indicate potential resource-light intervention change behaviour workplace , however , evidence effectiveness , feasibility acceptability currently limit . This proposal part ongoing collaboration NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde Healthy Working live . Representatives 10 organisation involve Healthy Working Lives initiative previously consult find intervention acceptable employer identify company interested participate pilot study . The consultation generate considerable interest project use outlook calendar ( available many staff ) provide prompt stand-up intervention consider acceptable many employer . This pilot intervention therefore build group 's exist research . 30 desk-based employee recruit participant via email invitation use poster display office . Volunteers screen regard inclusion/exclusion criterion give participant information sheet ask provide sign consent . The study 2-arm RCT 30 participant split equally control intervention group , group receive education reduce prolonged sitting , intervention group also receive hourly prompts stand period 10 week . Participants randomly assign group either individual basis cluster physical location within office ( minimise influence neighbour colleague different group ) . The method randomisation decide upon individual volunteer screen . Activity monitoring make baseline ( education session ) week 10 intervention 3 month post-intervention ( week 22 ) . All participant ask complete questionnaire ascertain basic demographic data , knowledge attitude towards sedentary behaviour previous engagement health promotion initiative . They ask wear water-proofed ActivPal monitor front thigh period 7 day ( 24 hour day ) order measure pattern sedentary behaviour baseline . To accompany measurement also keep diary record wake work hour 7 day period . Following baseline measurement participant attend education session cover : sedentary behaviour ( different physical activity ) , health problem associate prolonged sedentary behaviour , much sitting recommend advice reduce break prolonged sitting . Participants randomly assign ( use seal envelope prepare researcher involved recruitment intervention implementation ) either control intervention group group contain 15 participant , possible , physically separate within office . The control group return work normal following education session , whereas intervention group series prompt upload onto Microsoft Office calendar , via excel file , remind stand period one minute , every hour work day . These prompt run period 10 week . Participants able dismiss prompt soon appear choose whether stand remain seat . They also able dismiss group prompt accumulate period away computer . The impact work therefore think minimal . The content prompt brief , vary contain positively frame message . During last week 10 week period , control group intervention group ask wear ActivPal monitor keep diary period 7 day . 12 week end intervention period , 7 day ActivPal diary measurement repeat semi-structured focus group run participant organisational representative aim explore feasibility , acceptability , meaningfulness effectiveness intervention . Focus group record use digital voice recorder , topic guide regard content outline annex 6 annex 7 . The validated ActivPal monitor use acceleration signal thigh categorise data sitting/lying , stand walking , primary outcome measure total time spend sit work , time spend prolonged sit event work . Electronic copy data keep 10 year , alongside electronic paper copy baseline questionnaire diary audio transcribed account focus group , line Glasgow Caledonian University 's data protection policy . Physical activity data basic demographic data also keep password protect database secure server . The data hold database identifiable . The information collect may use analysis staff student School Health Life Sciences Glasgow Caledonian University later date . Access database control Dr Ben Stansfield , Reader School Health Life Sciences . At end study participant receive individual report detail pattern sedentary behaviour , intervention . They also access amalgamate report give employer summarise overall finding include key outcome focus group .</detailed_description>
