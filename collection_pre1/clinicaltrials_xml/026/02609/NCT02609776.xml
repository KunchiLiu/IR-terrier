	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Study JNJ-61186372 Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label ( participant know identity study drug ) , multicenter ( one study site ) , first-in-human study consist 2 part . Part 1 dose escalation Part 2 dose expansion cohort . In Part 1 , participant evaluable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) enrol cohort increase dose level JNJ-61186372 , administer 28 day treatment cycle . The dose escalate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD , maximum administer dose [ MAD ] , MTD find ) reach . Part 1 follow traditional 3+3 design . At dose level , 3 participant complete Cycle 1 . If dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) occur 3 participant , escalation continue new cohort 3 participant . Data Part 1 use determine recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . In Part 2 , participant document epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation measurable disease , whose disease progress treatment market EGFR inhibitor , enrol receive JNJ-61186372 RP2D determine Part 1 . For part , study consist 3 period : Screening period ( 28 day prior first dose study drug ) ; Treatment period ( first dose study drug last dose study drug ) ; Follow Up period ( 30 day last dose ) . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant must histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) metastatic unresectable . Participants must either progressed prior therapy , ineligible , refuse currently available therapeutic option For Part 2 : Participants must also document epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation ( include primary mutation exon 19 deletion , L858R acquire mutation T790M , mutation consider activate ) For Part 1 : Participant must evaluable disease . For Part 2 : Participant must measurable disease accord Response Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 For Part 2 : Participants disease must progress treatment market EGFR inhibitor Participant must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 Participant uncontrolled intercurrent illness , include limit poorly control hypertension , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , ongoing active infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement confound study result Participant prior chemotherapy , target cancer therapy , immunotherapy , treatment investigational anticancer agent within 2 week 4 halflives whichever longer , first administration JNJ61186372 . For agent long halflives , maximum required time since last dose 4 week . Toxicities previous anticancer therapy resolve baseline level Grade 1 less , except alopecia peripheral neuropathy Participants untreated brain metastasis . Participants treat metastasis stable base upon central nervous system ( CNS ) image corticosteroid treatment least 2 week prior study treatment eligible Participant history malignancy disease study within 5 year Screening ( exception squamous basal cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix , malignancy opinion investigator , concurrence sponsor 's medical monitor , consider cure minimal risk recurrence ) Participant fully recover major surgery significant traumatic injury prior first dose study drug expect major surgery study period within 6 month last dose study drug</criteria>
