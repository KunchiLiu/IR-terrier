	<detailed_description>The drug test study call vedolizumab subcutaneous ( vedolizumab SC ) . Vedolizumab SC test treat people moderate severely active Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . This study look clinical remission participant CD receive vedolizumab SC maintenance therapy achieve clinical response vedolizumab IV induction therapy . The study enroll approximately 824 patient . Participants enter 6 week Induction Phase administer open-label vedolizumab IV 300 mg via infusion Days 1 15 , assess clinical response Week 6 . Participants achieve clinical response Week 6 randomly assign one two treatment group : - Vedolizumab SC 108 mg Q2W - Placebo SC Q2W Participants achieve clinical response randomize Maintenance Period , instead receive third infusion vedolizumab IV 300 mg Week 6 . This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 71 week . Participants make multiple visit clinic , plus final visit 18 week last dose study drug follow-up assessment .
