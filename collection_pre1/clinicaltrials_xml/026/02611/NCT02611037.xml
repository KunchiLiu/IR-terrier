	<brief_title>Transarterial Chemoperfusion : Cisplatin , Methotrexate , Gemcitabine Unresectable Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single arm , phase 2 study lead safety cohort evaluate safety efficacy transarterial chemoperfusion treatment cisplatin ( 35 mg/m2^ ) , methotrexate ( 100 mg/m^2 ) gemcitabine ( 1000 mg/m^2 ) patient unresectable MPM . During lead phase study , 3 patient treat 50 % reduce dose methotrexate ( 50 mg/m^2 ) regular dos cisplatin ( 35 mg/m^2 body surface area ( BSA ) ) gemcitabine ( 1000 mg/m^2 BSA ) .</detailed_description>
