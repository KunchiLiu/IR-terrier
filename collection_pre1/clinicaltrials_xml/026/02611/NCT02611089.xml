	<detailed_description>The objective work understand origins soft tissue defect disable , disfigure limb anomaly call radial dysplasia , mechanism normal limb development disrupt patient produce phenotype . The investigator aim use knowledge improve treatment . Currently , despite sophisticated surgical treatment , limb malformation child bear typically recurs grow : thus 'unsolved problem ' . The investigator previously show , experimental mouse model radial dysplasia , underlie soft tissue problem change muscle connective tissue derivative , cause abnormal soft-tissue patterning . The investigator wish expand work investigator ' patient population compare sample post-natal muscle connective tissue derivative radial dysplasia patient control sample . The investigator ask patient undergo corrective hand surgery let investigator take small tissue sample plan operation . The investigator also ask patient form hand surgery , surgery hand injury , let investigator take similar sample comparison . In either case , scar peri-operative treatment unchanged . The investigator examine tissue sample investigator ' laboratory look change tissue architecture , cellular composition , cell signalling , behave grow culture . The investigator also make attempt derive cell line biopsy sample use study , explore cellular phenotype functional capacity . Simultaneously , investigator look long-term surgical outcome range genetic change investigator ' patient population . Eligible patient refer consideration ( separate ) 100,000 genome project ; expand investigator ' knowledge genetic change underlie limb anomaly . The ability combine data genotype , long-term phenotype soft tissue change give comprehensive overview condition . The investigator expect lead well understanding patient subgroup , provide rational basis improve treatment approach .</detailed_description>
