	<brief_summary>This study investigate effective way sterilize duodenoscopes ( `` scope '' ) use Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) . Right , BIDMC use standard method high level disinfection sterilize scope . Because infection pass scope institution U.S. , investigator explore whether add two different sterilization process reduce risk contamination . Bacteria may pass patient 's intestine scope . Or , scope contaminate , bacteria may pass scope patient . In order understand bacteria pass , investigator take sample patient 's intestinal bacteria compare bacteria , , find scope .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duodenoscope Disinfect Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This study design evaluate effect supplement standard high-level disinfection additional high level-disinfection sterilization procedure frequency duodenoscopes contamination . Duodenoscopes randomly assign one three arm : - Standard high-level disinfection currently perform BIDMC ( standard HLD ) - Standard high-level disinfection additional exposure time disinfectant ( double HLD ) - Standard high-level disinfection follow ethylene oxide ( HLD/ETO ) The study conduct follow element : 1 . All duodenoscopes randomly assign study arm duodenoscope use Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatogram ( ERCP ) procedure include study , include duodenoscopes introduce study . 2 . All duodenoscopes use ERCP follow culture obtain sterile fashion 3 . Patient study consent obtain patient rectal surveillance clinical culture obtain time ERCP procedure consent among patient undergo ERCP . Patients blind duodenoscope disinfection/sterilization assignment . 4 . The ERCP procedure perform accord standard clinical practice . Among patient consent specimen collection , duodenal aspirate obtain procedure . 5 . Among consent patient , rectal surveillance swab collect post-procedurally ERCP staff . 6 . After ERCP completion , current BIDMC-employed train technician perform assign disinfection/sterilization procedure .</detailed_description>
