	<brief_summary>Non-invasive brain stimulation gain increase popularity research support past several year . Recent research indicate might benefit improve hand function people spinal cord injury . The purpose study evaluate effect type non-invasive brain stimulation , know tDCS , hand function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) technique low intensity electrical current apply skull order excite underlie brain tissue . It study many population ( stroke , spinal cord injury , learn disability , migraine , memory ) may useful counterpart traditional rehabilitation neurological injury . Preliminary study member investigator 's lab group indicate beneficial , single-session effect tDCS hand function people spinal cord injury . Longer-term , multi-session trial warrant . Another approach research support augment effect hand function training peripheral nerve somatosensory stimulation ( PNSS ) . Unlike tDCS , excite brain tissue directly , PNSS excite brain via indirect approach . Members investigator ' lab find combination PNSS fine motor training effective improve hand function either intervention alone . Multi-session trial PNSS conduct ; however yet compare another clinically accessible adjunctive therapy , like tDCS , multi-session trial . The investigator plan study comparative effect tDCS hand function training PNSS hand function training hand function training alone people neck-level spinal cord injury . People acute/subacute ( &lt; 6 month post-injury ) chronic ( &gt; 1 year post-injury ) injury enrol , order look responses tDCS different stage recovery . Before begin training , participant complete approximately three hour test arm/hand function self-reported perception overall function . Participants randomly assign receive either tDCS , PNSS , sham tDCS combination personalize fine motor training . This training take place 3 times/week , total 3 hour training/week , 4 week . Fine motor training base principle show optimize neuroplasticity ( change brain and/or spinal cord ) , yet customize , order allow participant work towards individualize goal . At end 4 week , participant complete three-hour post-test use measure examine change arm hand function . Participants ask return Shepherd Center 4 - 6 week follow post-intervention assessment complete post-intervention assessment .</detailed_description>
