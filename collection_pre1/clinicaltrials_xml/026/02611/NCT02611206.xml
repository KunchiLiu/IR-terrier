	<brief_summary>This study open-label 6-week ( 30 session ) trial active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) use fix frequency ( 10 Hz ) vary stimulation intensity use 3+3 study design safety tolerability amongst adolescent . This mean enroll 3 participant time give rTMS stimulation intensity energy 80 % motor threshold ( MT ) . If three participant complete 6 week treatment major safety event ( i.e . seizure ) , increase energy next 3 participant 5 % . If 1 3 participant major safety event , enroll 3 patient SAME energy . We proceed manner , increase 5 % 3 subject safely complete treatment energy , maximum energy 120 % motor threshold . If 2 participant intensity level cohort experience major safety event , discontinue run subject energy level . If happens initial energy level 80 % MT , stop study . If reach 2 event higher energy cohort , return previous energy level complete remainder subject energy level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Adolescent Depression : Efficacy , Predictive Biomarkers , Mechanisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adolescents Treatment Resistant Depression ( TRD ) ( n=30 ) recruit inpatient outpatient adolescent mental health clinical service UMN surround area . Adolescents parent undergo consent process initial clinical evaluation . This initial evaluation do use Kiddie Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia ( K-SADS-PL 2009 ) Children 's Depression Rating Scale-Revised ( CDRS-R ) . Participants family also ask complete Antidepressant Treatment Report ( ATR ) , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI-II ) , Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) , Inventory Depression Anxiety Symptoms ( IDAS ) , Temporal Experience Pleasure Scale ( TEPS ) , Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale ( SHAPS ) , Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) , Edinburgh Handedness Scale , Weschler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence ( WASI ) Tanner Pubertal Staging Questionnaire . Participants also ask complete NIH Toolbox , Children 's Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( CAVLT ) , Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System ( D-KEFS ) Trail Making Test . Adolescents TRD fit inclusion/exclusion criterion ( presence major depression CDRS-R raw score &gt; 40 ; history least one fail treatment trial antidepressant [ define Antidepressant Treatment Report ] ; history seizure disorder ; presence MRI contraindication [ e.g . claustrophobia metallic implant ] ) schedule : A . A baseline MRI ( describe ) B . 6 week series rTMS visit describe C. A post-treatment MRI D. A post-treatment clinical assessment ( blind treatment assignment ) E. 6 monthly follow visit In first rTMS visit , study physician fit cap , determine ideal location stimulation , measure MT MEPa . Adolescents receive 6 week rTMS , 20 minutes/day , 5 days/week administer trained technician . Active treatment 43 train 10 Hz , stimulation intensity vary describe , inter-train interval 20 second , 1680 pulses/session . A member research staff meet weekly patient complete CDRS-R , monitor treatment tolerance use Side Effects Form Children Adolescents , measure MT MEPa . Adolescents also complete BDI-II , C-SSRS-SLV , IDAS , TEPS , YMRS , SHAPS weekly . At week four , participant ask repeat NIH Toolbox , Children 's Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( CAVLT ) , Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System ( D-KEFS ) Trail Making Test . Scanning take place Center Magnetic Resonance Research 3T Siemens Prisma scanner baseline ( clinical assessment , first treatment ) last rTMS treatment . Participants complete MRI safety form provide urine sample rule substance use ( participant ) pregnancy ( female ) . A high-resolution T1 image collect ( voxel size=1mm isotropic ; TR=2530ms ; TE=3.65ms , T1=1100ms , flip angle=7° , 5 minute ) . Functional data acquire use Human Connectome Project ( HCP ) 38 multiband echo planar image sequence ( whole brain T2*-weighted functional volume , 72 contiguous slice ; TR=720ms ; TE=34.2ms ; flip angle=55o , FOV=212mm ; voxel size=2mm isotropic ; matrix=106x106 ; multiband factor=8 ; 12 minute ) rest eye open view fixation cross . Participants ask complete task fMRI present series visual stimulus , ( human face vary emotion expression positive , negative neutral word print face ) . During task , participant ask decide whether word print face positive negative regardless emotion face show . Each subject complete four distinct block task . After completion rTMS session , participant undergo final assessment ask meet evaluator complete CDRS-R . They also ask complete BDI-II , C-SSRS , TEPS , SHAPS , IDAS NIH Toolbox . After completion rTMS session , participant ask return see researcher every month 6 month assess length treatment response .</detailed_description>
