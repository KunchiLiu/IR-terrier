	<brief_summary>The rationale design initial utilization standard-of-care therapy mCRC ( radioembolization ) dose-calculation algorithm verify predictive treatment response . Prediction treatment failure enable propose subsequent locoregional therapy select base safety profile feasibility . While goal study assess feasibility safety approach , end goal improve overall patient outcome improve hepatic tumor control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Ablative Strategies After Endovascular Radioembolization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As median time radiographic response range 3-8 month publish data , utilization post-treatment PET/MRI dosimetry offer powerful mechanism immediate ( within 36 hour ) prediction lesion likely fail radioembolization . This early prediction enables window subsequent locoregional therapy prior re-initiation systemic chemotherapy . The investigator propose evaluate patient undergo radioembolization mCRC use PET/MRI derive dosimetry obtain within 36 hour radioembolization procedure . Patients four tumor few receive average dose ( Davg ) less 30 Gy candidate subsequent locoregional therapy ( stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) microwave ablation ) . This strategy ideally increase therapeutic index locoregional therapy , particularly patient population exhaust option systemic therapy . After radioembolization , patient divide 5 stratum per protocol schema . Patients receive Davg great 30 Gy hepatic lesion place Stratum 1 undergo subsequent therapy . Patients four few lesion receive Davg le 30 Gy place Strata 2 , 3 , 4 base distribution underdosed lesion . Stratum 2 comprise patient four few underdosed lesion less 3 cm touch vasculature great 4 mm size . Patients stratum receive percutaneous microwave ablation underdosed lesion . Stratum 3 compose patient 4 few underdosed lesion amenable microwave ablation virtue either size ( great 3 cm ) proximity hepatic vasculature great 4 mm diameter . These patient treat SBRT underdosed lesion . Patients combination lesion amenable microwave ablation ( due either size proximity vasculature ) treat Stratum 4 combine approach - microwave ablation lesion amenable SBRT remain underdosed lesion . Finally , Stratum 5 consist patient 4 underdosed lesion disease progression ; patient refer systemic therapy candidate locoregional therapy study .</detailed_description>
