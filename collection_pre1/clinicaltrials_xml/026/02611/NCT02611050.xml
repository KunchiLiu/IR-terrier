	<detailed_description>Multi-vessel coronary artery disease treat percutaneous coronary intervention , coronary artery bypass grafting , medical therapy . Treatments risk benefit tradeoff , make patient preference integral treatment decision . The Multi-vessel Coronary Artery Disease Option Grid patient decision aid develop improve decision make process patient clinician . Objectives : 1 . Evaluate The Multi-vessel Coronary Artery Disease Option Grid impact patient treatment decisional conflict , knowledge , share decision making . The randomized controlled trial compare validate standardized measure patient decisional conflict , share decision making , condition specific treatment knowledge Option Grid usual care patient . The investigator hypothesize Option Grid patient improvement patient decisional conflict , share decision making , knowledge compare usual care patient . Baseline feasibility enrollment site prior randomization use identify current treatment pattern , prepare intervention delivery fidelity . Registry data use identify patient treatment receive compare Option Grid usual care arm . 2 . Examine physician patient process factor influence Multi-vessel Coronary Artery Disease Option Grid use . Semi-structured interview process evaluation use describe Option Grid use experience identify factor associate beneficial Option Grid use .</detailed_description>
