	<brief_summary>Dendritic cell ( DCs ) serve sentry immune system . DCs recognize foreign compound ( antigen ) body , internalize process . When DCs uptake foreign antigen , migrate secondary lymphoid organ , process antigen present T cell . Various DC subset unique cell lineage , surface protein marker , tissue localization determinant identify . For example , Langerhans cell ( LCs ) interstitial dendritic cell ( intDCs ) DCs find stratify epithelium , skin . Though expressed skin , differ respect origin surface protein content activate distinct type immune response . They may also different specificity capture antigens presentation circulate T cell . To date , unknown role , , different DC population reside repopulate skin play development progression skin graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) follow bone marrow transplant .</brief_summary>
