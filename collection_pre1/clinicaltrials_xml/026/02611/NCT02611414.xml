	<brief_title>Effectiveness tDCS Treatment Functional Dyspepsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional dyspepsia high prevalent disease substantial cost health system . There many available treatment , disappointing result report clinical trial . TDCS noninvasive , secure painless technique brain stimulation . It deliver battery-operated device transfer low intensity electrical current surface brain . Then modulation cortical excitability influence central neurological function . It report efficacy treatment many disease depression chronic pain . Impairment central mechanism interpretation threshold pain related functional dyspepsia . Therefore , tDCS may benefit dyspeptic patient . This study double blind randomize controled trial test tDCS effectiveness functional dyspepsia . Seventy functional dyspeptic patient enrol , randomize either tDCS sham tDCS .</detailed_description>
