	<brief_summary>The investigator image patient prostate cancer use new PET imaging agent ( Ga-68 HBED-CC PSMA ) order evaluate 's ability detection prostate cancer patient high risk disease prior prostatectomy , patient biochemical recurrence patient castrate resistant prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Gallium-68-HBED-CC-PSMA Imaging Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imaging stag prostate cancer critical surgical treatment planning . Patients suspect metastatic prostate cancer image use Gallium-68 label HBED-CC PSMA order demonstrate utility . The investigator plan utilize data obtain approval HBED-CC PSMA compound , agent become available clinical imaging prostate cancer patient . This compound show superior choline base PET agent stag prostate cancer , Carbon-11 Fluorine-18 compound . But compound patent therefore company private entity make investment require bring HBED-CC PSMA market . In vacuum availability , academic group must take lead order collect necessary data future FDA approval . This study focus three patient population image . In pre-prostatectomy population , primary objective determine sensitivity specificity detection nodal metastasis . In biochemical recurrence population , primary objective determine sensitivity recurrence location . In castrate resistant prostate cancer population primary objective determine PSMA PET detect metastatic lesion conventional imaging .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Known prostate cancer clinical concern presence metastatic disease delineate : Treatment naïve patient one follow risk factor : CAPRA ( Cancer Prostate Risk Assessment ) score ≥ 5 , PSA ≥ 15 ng/mL and/or Gleason score ≥ 4+4 . Patients biochemical recurrence prostatectomy radiation therapy PSA double time le 12 month . . These patient may receive androgen deprivation therapy prior image . Patients castrate resistant prostate cancer progressive disease define PCWG2 criterion ( 27 ) . . Patients castrate resistant prostate cancer either treatment treatment 2 . Age &gt; 18 . 3 . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 50 ( ECOG/WHO equivalent ) . 4 . Ability understand write informed consent document , willingness sign . 1 . Patients exceed weight limitation scanner able enter bore PET scanner due BMI . 2 . Inability lie still entire imaging time ( e.g . cough , severe arthritis , etc. ) . 3 . Inability complete need investigational due reason ( severe claustrophobia , radiation phobia , etc . ) .</criteria>
