	<brief_title>Video vs. TTG Respiratory Inhaler Technique Assessment InstructioN ( V-TRaIN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) result million hospitalization United States annually COPD third lead cause 30-day re-hospitalizations . Clinical trial establish efficacy treatment primarily dispense via respiratory inhaler device reduce morbidity health care utilization use correctly . Unfortunately , effectiveness medication real-world setting limit fact patient often use inhaler correctly . Current guideline recommend assess teach inhaler technique health care encounter , include hospitalization . My work find 75 % hospitalized patient urban , predominantly underserved population misuse respiratory inhaler , highlight miss opportunity educate patient high potential benefit . Hospitalization , therefore , provide potential 'teachable moment ' correct misuse . My preliminary data indicate one strategy , in-person teach-to-goal ( TTG ) , effective teach hospitalized patient proper inhaler technique effective simple verbal instruction . While TTG promise method improve care patient use inhaler , several limitation prevent widespread adoption . First , TTG rely in-person assessment education , well train monitor instructor ensure fidelity , make time-consuming costly . Also , single educational session ensure long-term retention , post-discharge reinforcement may need , may impractical in-person TTG . One potential method surmount TTG 's limitation use interactive video module education ( VME ) , method use health education clinical context . Through iterative self-assessments video-demonstrations tablet computer , VME potential less costly , maintain fidelity , easily extend post-discharge set in-person TTG . However , certain question remain VME . It unclear whether VME yield similar result compare TTG , whether patient ability , willing use , VME post-discharge setting . Therefore , widespread implementation VME , critical rigorously develop test VME inhaler education hospital set . Ultimately , also important understand patient ' ability willingness use post-discharge VME educational reinforcement allow strategy transition patient across care setting hospital home .</detailed_description>
