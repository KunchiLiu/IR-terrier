	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) associate various psychological disorder symptom . Depression present 15-47 % MS patient , estimate three time great general population . Anxiety depression closely associate , independently interaction , fatigue . Mohr et al . ( 2003 ) show improvement depressive symptom closely associated decrease severity fatigue . These symptom represent disable symptom heavy psychosocial consequence patient , example affect relationship , leisure activity employment . Given also young age MS occur important symptom adequately recognize treated prevent chronicity . A recent study psychological treatment depressive symptom patient medical disorder state treat comorbid depression one priorities medical care setting . Feinstein ( 2011 ) highlight treatment depression public health care service may also adjust accord availability resource access . Thereby essential establish brief cost-effective intervention reduce depression symptom psychological burden improve Quality Life ( QoL ) patient . Mindfulness-based intervention proven effective improve depressive symptom enhance QoL many different chronic condition recently also MS patient . Mindfulness could define nonjudgmental awareness acceptance one 's moment-to-moment experience . As described Bishop et al . ( 2004 ) , mindfulness consist two main component : self- regulation attention particular orientation toward experience . Self-regulation attention concern nonjudgmental observation awareness physical sensation , affective state thought arise . Orientation experience refers attitude acceptance curiosity toward one 's experience . Mindfulness effect distress tendency escape over-engage one 's disturbing feeling thought . Several study highlight effect mindfulness psychological health : ithas associate high level QoL , life satisfaction , self-esteem , empathy , self-compassion , sense autonomy competence among clinical non-clinical population . In addition , thesestudies show negative correlation mindfulness negative affect psychopathologicalsymptoms , depressive symptom , rumination , anger , difficulty emotion regulation , social anxiety . These study also show efficacy MBI improve anxiety depression symptom related physical illness like cancer , chronic fatigue syndrome , fibromyalgia , chronic pain , arthritis , diabetes , heart disease , stroke , traumatic brain injury . Several study neuroimaging biological marker also point effect mindfulness neurobiological level , show effect regulation emotional response inhibition amygdala proper function prefrontal cortex alter cortisol immune pattern consistent less stress mood disturbance , decrease blood pressure . In recent year , widespread mindfulness-based approach , generically call Mindfulness Based Intervention ( MBI ) , base upon MBSR also incorporate technique derive clinical psychology psychotherapy , mainly focus emotion regulation , development somatic resource , self-compassion ( directed towards towards others , i.e . love kindness compassion meditation , great focus MBSR mind-body integration interpersonal relationship . MBI consider effective cost-effective treatment address difficulty derive serious psycho-social impact highly disable chronic disease , MS , change range emotional evaluative dimension underlie general aspect well-being . MBI therefore useful counteract suffer cause symptom , fatigue , depressive anxiety symptomatology distress deal disability . A key objective MBI intervention improvement QoL . Moreover , study report stress may one factor influence risk MS exacerbation . This highlight even importance develop intervention aim reduce stress patient MS . The study Grossman et al . ( 2010 ) , knowledge study evaluate efficacy group MBI MS compare usual care , show cost-effective relatively brief group intervention may improve broad range parameter well-being patient MS . This study limitations research project aim overcome , lack control group assess specificity MBI , lack objective measure emotional measure psychopathological symptom . In project , propose include active control intervention ( psycho-education plus relaxation ) addition usual care , assess psychological functioning MS patient semi-structured clinical interview ( SCID ) addition self-report measure . Moreover , aim evaluate efficacy MBI MS patient depressive symptom , measure score great 13 Beck Depression Inventory-II . The NICE guideline ( 2009 ) indicate psychological intervention mindfulness psycho-education , combine drug therapy alternative depend case , result effective term efficacy term cost-effectiveness compare drug therapy alone . Also highlight Hofmann et al. , ( 2010 ) MBI may effective population mood disorder . Furthermore , project aim involve patient ' caregiver ask participate group patient assign . We expect caregiver benefit treatment receive , due load stress difficulty relate management chronic disable disease like MS . Furthermore , recent study show patient ' depressive state influence deterioration QoL depression caregiver . In fact MBI deal directly disease , attitude relate self , others life . Finally , project base MBSR protocol order maximize clinical utility people suffer MS depression , tailor mindfulness intervention need specific population . We apply modified MBSR protocol integrate body center technique Sensorimotor Psychotherapy ( SP ; Ogden et al. , 2006 ) . SP develop Pat Ogden model Ron Kurtz , body psychotherapy build mindfulness ( Kurtz , 1990 ) . Most point already part MBSR model , integration deepen specifically increase clinical efficacy . We aim evaluate whether group-based Mindfulness Based Intervention reduce depressive symptom improve QoL patient , also reduce correlate symptom , like anxiety , fatigue perceive stress modify perception disease deal interpersonal relationship . Primary aim : evaluate efficacy MBI depressive symptom QoL MS patient , compare active control intervention usual care group , assess whether expect benefit maintain 6-month follow-up . The secondary aim study ass whether Mindfulness Based Intervention improvement anxiety symptom , fatigue perceived stress ; another secondary aim evaluate efficacy intervention perception illness whether participate MBI improve also interpersonal relationship . Another secondary aim evaluate efficacy MBI depression , QoL relate symptoms caregiver .</detailed_description>
