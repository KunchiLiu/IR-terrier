	<detailed_description>Lymphedema chronic , debilitate disease cause lymphatic flow obstruction . Breast cancer-related lymphedema ( BCRL ) secondary mastectomy and/or radiation therapy grow health concern , report incidence high 94 % breast cancer survivor . Behavioral adjustment aggressive therapeutic management reduce long-term impairment optimize quality life . However , currently standard clinical procedure identify patient great BCRL risk fundamental gap exist even basic knowledge lymphatic system respond node dissection subsequent therapy . Specialized image method demonstrate reduced lymphatic flow velocity lymphatic contractility impairment may signify great BCRL risk , however approach frequently require radioactive tracer exogenous contrast agent alter physiological environment primarily available specialized center . As , method simply impractical routine BCRL monitoring human report clinical trial endpoint . Recent work demonstrate spin labeling , popular noninvasive MRI method measure perfusion , adapt measure lymphatic fluid flow axillary lymph node . Furthermore chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST ) MRI , popular method measure protein content pH change brain , breast , liver , translate lymphatic system assess sensitive change interstitial protein accumulation , hallmark lymphedema progression . Recent work provide motivation technique demonstrate , use commercially available equipment , consistent change lymphatic property detectable vivo ( ) condition cuff-induced lymph flow manipulation , ( ii ) affect vs. unaffected arm BCRL patient . Here , method implement sequence standard clinical MRI measure lymph structure expand understand lymph physiology different stage BCRL response therapy . Hypothesis ( 1 ) . Axillary lymph node vessel , velocity lymphatic fluid , interstitial protein accumulation visualize reproducible manner use noninvasive MRI approach frequently use measure analogous metric brain , breast , liver . Aim ( 1 ) . Turbo-spin-echo , spin labeling , CEST MRI apply assess lymph collector volume , lymphatic flow velocity , interstitial protein accumulation , respectively , together first time healthy female volunteer . Intraclass Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient calculate understand reproducibility age-dependence parameter uncompromised lymphatic system . Hypothesis ( 2 ) . ( 2a ) The MRI protocol apply Aim ( 1 ) use detect ( ) increase interstitial protein accumulation ( ii ) reduction lymphatic velocity patient mild moderate BCRL , ( 2b ) functional metric variable limb volume measurement patient early BCRL disease stage follow common manual lymphatic drainage ( MLD ) therapy , thereby demonstrate utility image biomarkers identify lymphatic dysfunction monitor therapy response . Aim ( 2 ) . The Aim ( 1 ) protocol apply patient preclinical ( Stage 0 ) , mild ( Stage I ) , moderate ( Stage II ) BCRL together volumetric limb measurement MLD therapy . A Wilcoxon rank-sum test use ass difference parameter patient volunteer different BCRL stage well pre- post-MLD therapy . These data provide exemplar novel , internal imaging measurement lymphatic function vary disease severity therapy administration . Hypothesis ( 3 ) . In preclinical BCRL patient ( Stage 0 ) , reduce lymphatic velocity increase interstitial protein accumulation correlate elevate two-year BCRL progression risk . Aim ( 3 ) . Stage 0 BCRL patient undergo identical MRI protocol outline Aim ( 1 ) follow-up disability metric record two year post-therapy . A multi-parametric analysis use test correlation hypothesize image biomarkers BCRL progression , thereby demonstrate extent acute MRI may use stratify risk patient high risk BCRL . This work first time translate noninvasive , multi-modal MRI protocol , demonstrate clinical potential brain , liver , breast application , human lymphatic system well characterize lymphatic dysfunction , therapy response , BCRL risk grow breast cancer survivor population .</detailed_description>
