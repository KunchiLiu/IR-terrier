	<brief_title>LDCT Screening Non-smokers Taiwan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer rank No . 1 lethal cancer Taiwan , five-year survival rate ( 5-yr SR ) 15 % . Most patient early lung cancer asymptomatic , 75 % patient cancer-related symptom diagnosis local distant metastasis . Compared 5-yr SR 70-90 % stage I/II lung cancer , 5-yr SR late stage IIIb/IV le 15 % . Despite progress pharmaceutical treatment late stage disease , early detection still way improve outcome even cure potentially lethal disease . Low dose compute tomography ( LDCT ) recognize best tool available early diagnosis lung cancer . However , radiation exposure , high cost high false-positive rate major concern adapt detection tool general population . Recent study Europe US show LDCT screen high-risk cigarette smoke population effectively reduce lung cancer mortality . However , major type lung cancer Taiwan adenocarcinoma , commonly occur non-smoker . Therefore , risk prediction model generate study western country may suitable directly adapt country . LDCT screen lung cancer detection non-smoker remain controversial issue worldwide , include Taiwan . Facing unmet need , urgent establish risk assessment model predict lung cancer risk non-smokers evaluate efficacy LDCT screen non-smoker high-risk population . There three specific aim propose study carry three phase . The first ( pilot ) phase ( 2014 2015 , 14 month ) , aim establish LDCT screen protocol risk assessment model lung cancer prediction . 4500 subject enrol first LDCT screening , preliminary result analyze . The second phase ( 2016-2017 , 24 month ) considers perform follow LDCT enroll another 7500 subject LDCT screen follow . The fine tuning LDCT screen protocol risk assessment model perform . The third phase ( 2018-2019 , 24 month ) complete image clinical follow subject , detection rate lung cancer , false-positive rate , cost-effectiveness analysis LDCT screen non-smoker lung cancer Taiwan establish . Aim 1 : To evaluate risk assessment model predict lung cancer non-smokers According result LDCT screening , expect improve risk prediction model nonsmoker female establish GELAC study . The revise risk model help recognize high risk population . Aim 2 : To establish protocol LDCT screening pilot study Taiwan Establishing work protocol procedure LDCT screen assure homogeneous behavior among study site Aim 3 : To establish efficacy LDCT screening lung cancer non-smoker Lung cancer detection rate , false-positive rate , cost-effectiveness analysis LDCT screen non-smoker lung cancer Taiwan establish .</detailed_description>
