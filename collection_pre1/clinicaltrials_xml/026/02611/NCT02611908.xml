	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether combination obinutuzumab ibrutinib ( administer 840 mg per day ) might useful treatment CLL SLL respond longer respond treatment ibrutinib alone . The study evaluate whether regimen reduce amount cancerous cell body . Subjects treat ibrutinib dose 840 mg day mouth , well obinutuzumab infusion . Although agent approve FDA treatment CLL SLL , combination dose schedule ibrutinib consider experimental .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Obinutuzumab With High-dose Ibrutinib Treatment Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia With Progressive Disease Single Agent Ibrutinib .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 study patient CLL small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) experience disease progression single ibrutinib . This study evaluate optimal ibrutinib dose ( include dose high 420 mg ) combine obinutuzumab . During screen period , patient continue ibrutinib previous tolerate dose , unless require stop ( e.g . : precede clinical trial ) . On cycle 1 , day 1 , dose ibrutinib assign base dose cohort . Patients cohort 1 receive ibrutinib 420 mg PO daily . Patients cohort 2 receive ibrutinib 560 mg PO daily . Cohort 3 700 mg PO daily . Cohort 4 840 mg PO daily . On cycle 1 , day 1 , patient also initiate treatment obinutuzumab ( 100 mg day 1 , 900mg day 2 , 1000mg day 8 , 15 , 28 q 28 day total 8 dos ) . The primary safety endpoint determination DLTs first 28 day . The primary efficacy endpoint overall response rate assess 2 month final dose obinutuzumab .</detailed_description>
