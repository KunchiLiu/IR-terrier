	<brief_summary>The hypothesis efficient prevention thrombosis aspirin diagnosis become less useful patient achieve complete hematologic response ( CHR ) and/or benefit hamper increase hemorrhagic risk especially elderly patient . Hence , investigator propose prospective randomize study assess benefit / risk ratio aspirin maintenance high risk Essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) patient , complete hematological response Hydroxyurea .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxyurea Versus Aspirin Hydroxyurea Essential Thrombocythemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ET myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) characterize high platelet level . Increased occurrence thrombosis hemorrhage main complication ET . In regard , key factor define high risk ET include age 60 year , past history thrombosis , platelet &gt; 1500 109/L less degree cardiovascular risk factor . These criterion currently serve therapeutic guideline use cytoreductive therapy , hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment choice first line set . The use antiplatelet agent i.e . low-dose aspirin also generally recommend . However , benefit aspirin never formally demonstrate ET . Only indirect evidence come ECLAP study enrol patient polycythemia vera ( PV ) . Of note ECLAP study , efficacy aspirin assess diagnosis correlate thereafter hematological response cytoreductive therapy . In general non-MPN population study , primary prophylaxis aspirin associate risk reduction major vascular event , increase risk hemorrhage , especially consider age prior gastrointestinal history . In recent retrospective study , combination aspirin cytoreduction report prevent thrombosis concomitantly increase bleed risk compare HU alone , especially patient older 60 year , thus question benefit long term use aspirin therapy . These data raise question actual benefit aspirin maintenance , patient efficiently treat cytoreductive therapy . Hence , investigator propose prospective randomize study assess benefit / risk ratio aspirin maintenance high risk ET patient , complete hematological response Hydroxyurea . Patients Aspirin interruption possible extra-ET indication enrol control observational arm .</detailed_description>
