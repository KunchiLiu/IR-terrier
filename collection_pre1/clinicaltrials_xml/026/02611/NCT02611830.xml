	<detailed_description>The drug test study call vedolizumab subcutaneous ( vedolizumab SC ) . Vedolizumab SC test treat people moderate severely active ulcerative colitis . This study look clinical remission well mucosal heal , durable clinical response , durable clinical remission , corticosteroid free remission participant UC receive vedolizumab SC maintenance therapy achieve clinical response vedolizumab IV induction therapy . The study enroll approximately 400 patient . All participant enter 6 week Induction Phase administer open-label vedolizumab IV 300 mg via intravenous infusion ( IV ) Week 0 ( Day 1 ) Week 2 ( day 15 ) , assess clinical response Week 6 . Participants achieve clinical response Week 6 randomly assign one three treatment group : - Vedolizumab SC 108 mg Q2W Placebo IV Q8W - Vedolizumab IV 300 mg Q8W Placebo SC Q2W - Placebo SC Q2W Placebo IV Q8W Participants achieve clinical response Week 6 randomized Maintenance Period , receive third infusion vedolizumab IV 300 mg Week 6 . This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 71 week . Participants make multiple visit clinic , plus final visit 18 week last dose study drug follow-up assessment .
