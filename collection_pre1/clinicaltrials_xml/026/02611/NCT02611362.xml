	<detailed_description>The use antiretroviral medication reduce risk acquire HIV infection ( Pre-exposure Prophylaxis , PrEP ) efficacious promise new prevention strategy . In published study , failure PrEP associate poor adherence low plasma drug level . This indicate optimal PrEP treatment require behavioral intervention promote adherence . Averting increase risk behavior also essential maintain PrEP 's protective effect . Interventions need address on-going HIV risk behavior relevant person use PrEP ( e.g . young adult MSM ) . Borrowing recent literature HIV prevention treatment adherence , intervention utilize intuitive easy use technology motivational component show promise behavior change dissemination . This study examine multi-level technology integrate medication monitoring device ( Wisepill dispenser ) WITH interactive smartphone base app/game immersive appealing . This novel , intuitive multi-level technology measure PrEP adherence , promote engagement treatment safe sexual behavior . The smartphone app/game develop include content consistent Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills ( IMB ) Model . While game , participant experience absorb action-oriented adventure increase information health ( e.g . knowledge PrEP treatment HIV ) , improve motivation ( e.g . action-figures experience health benefit adherence ) , build skill ( e.g . utilize clinician partner , condom self efficacy ) . Adherence data participant ' Wisepill device integrate app/game wirelessly translate enhancement game play . In-depth interview young adult PrEP open trial intervention inform development intervention procedure . A small randomized control pilot study among 50 participant PrEP examine preliminary efficacy intervention ( integration Wisepill dispenser IMB inform app/game ) . It hypothesize , compare subject control group , participant IMB Gaming Intervention show : improve adherence PrEP , high blood ARV level , decrease HIV risk behavior , improve self efficacy attitude PrEP treatment adherence . The specific aim : 1 . To create engage absorb smartphone base app/game content consistent Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills ( IMB ) model measure improve PrEP treatment adherence safer sex behavior , receive feedback game 's utility acceptability in-depth interview MSM ( estimate mean age 27 ) . 2 . To conduct open trial IMB Gaming Intervention ( integrate electronic , portable medication dispenser IMB game , Viral Combat ) MSM obtain qualitative quantitative information acceptability , feasibility . These data use modify approach technology need . 3 . To evaluate , 24 week randomize control pilot study ( n=50 ) , preliminary efficacy IMB Gaming Intervention integrate electronic medication dispenser IMB inform app/game compare time , attention , technology match group . We examine impact IMB Gaming Intervention improve treatment adherence ( measure medication dispenser opening , clinic visit attend , self-report ) biological measure ( ARV level ) . We also examine impact HIV risk behavior .</detailed_description>
