	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common third leading cause cancer-related death worldwide . Recurrence tumor within liver remnant common , report 5-year recurrence rate 70 % . Repeat hepatectomy effective treatment intrahepatic HCC small proportion resection rate poor functional liver reserve postoperative complication . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) become main effective treatment small HCC ( ≤5.0cm ) . The efficacy RFA recurrent HCC report comparable achieve surgery minimal , high local recurrence rate RFA . It report immunotherapy patient underwent curative treatment HCC , adjuvant immunotherapy activate CIK cell increase recurrence-free overall survival . But little evidence adjuvant immunotherapy recurrence HCC . Cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) , kind effective T cell specific recognize kill antigen target cell clone amplification receive antigen information antigen present cell play key role clear cancerous cell . So hypothesis RFA combine immunotherapy ( Highly-purified CTL ) superior RFA recurrent HCC . The aim prospective study compare outcome RFA combine immunotherapy ( Highly-purified CTL ) RFA small recurrent HCC partial hepatectomy .</brief_summary>
