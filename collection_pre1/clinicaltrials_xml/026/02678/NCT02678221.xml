	<brief_summary>Intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) define fetal abdominal circumference ( AC ) estimate fetal weight ( EFW ) &lt; 10th centile . In asymmetrical IUGR parameter classically affect abdominal circumference ( AC ) . Fetal growth restriction ( FGR ) complicate approximately 0.4 % pregnancy severely increase risk perinatal morbidity mortality . This particularly due premature delivery , fetal secondary maternal indication development pre-eclampsia . Consequence deficient uteroplacental blood flow , include IUGR , pre-eclampsia , placental abruption implicate 50 % iatrogenic premature birth . For reason , problem severe IUGR form substantial portion population tertiary care centre care . The effect early-onset IUGR particularly significant : born alive , less third survive neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) stay without significant neurodevelopmental sequela . Survival rate severely growth-restricted fetus remote term ( &lt; 28 week ' gestation ) vary 7 % 33 % . As early-onset IUGR child born preterm , significant risk neonatal mortality , major minor morbidity , long-term health sequela . The use ultrasound Doppler waveform analysis pregnancy complicate IUGR suggests compromise uteroplacental circulation placental hypoperfusion . Currently specific evidence-based therapy placental insufficiency severe IUGR . Non-specific intervention include primarily lifestyle modification , reduce stop work , stop aerobic exercise , rest home , hospital admission rest surveillance . These intervention , support evidence randomize trial , use belief rest enhance uteroplacental circulation expense gluteus quadriceps muscle . There evidence ex vivo animal model growth restriction phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil citrate increase average birth weight improve uteroplacental blood flow ( umbilical artery , uterine artery ) .</brief_summary>
