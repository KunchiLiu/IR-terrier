	<brief_title>Injection-Assisted Cold Snare Polypectomy Versus Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Small Colorectal Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polypectomy basis colorectal cancer prevention interrupt adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence . Most polypectomy perform diminutive ( â‰¤5mm ) small ( 6-10mm ) colorectal lesion represent &gt; 90 % overall burden resect polyp . Although potential neoplasia usually size-dependent , recent evidence suggest even diminutive small polyp harbor substantial risk advance neoplasia ( series high 9-10 % ) . Complete resection neoplastic polyp pivotal , 8.8 % 50 % interval cancer may arise consequence incomplete polypectomy . However , ideal method remove small colorectal polyp remain uncertain . Cold snare polypectomy become standard technique allow comprehensive safe resection diminutive polyp , though significant incomplete resection rate challenge implementation CSP large ( particular 8-10mm ) polyp . Submucosal injection solution contain stain dye could improve outcome cold snare polypectomy : ) lift lesion submucosal chromoendoscopy could sharply delineate margin facilitate capture removal use cold snare , b ) formation submucosal cushion could minimize mechanical damage submucosal vessel , prevent occurrence immediate bleeding . Use electrocautery believe reduce risk incomplete resection , although less attractive safety standpoint due risk complication include delayed bleeding , post-polypectomy syndrome perforation . Injection submucosal solution order lift lesion ( injection-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection , EMR ) facilitate `` hot '' resection sessile flat neoplasm allow deep resection margin compare conventional polypectomy , minimize electrocautery damage create safety cushion . Despite highly efficient , EMR still carry substantial risk complication ( series 7-8 % ) generally limited uptake technique among endoscopists removal small polyp . Therefore , investigator design randomize control trial ass whether injection-assisted cold snare polypectomy may noninferior EMR resection small ( 6-10mm ) colorectal polyp . METHODS The study conduct endoscopy unit Benizelion General Hospital ( Heraklion , Crete , Greece ) Konstantopoulio General Hospital ( Nea Ionia , Athens , Greece ) . Consecutive subject age 18 year agree inform consent least one polyp eligible size ( 6-10mm ) randomly assign two group : 1 . Injection-assisted cold snare polypectomy ( I-CSP ) . Polyps group resect cold snare technique pre-lift lesion submucosal injection methylene blue-tinted normal saline solution . The polyp small rim normal tissue snare closely remove single piece without use electrocautery . 2 . Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) . Polyps group remove single piece use `` inject-and-cut '' EMR technique . Methylene blue-tinted normal saline solution inject submucosal space follow application snare cautery lesion resection . All polypectomy specimens retrieve suction polyp trap use retrieval forceps send histopathological examination . The polypectomy site rinse tap water carefully inspect residual polyp . Targeted biopsy obtain area polypectomy site margin suspicious residual tissue . Protrusions polypectomy base I-CSP record biopsy take separate histological assessment . Histological evaluation polypectomy specimens post-polypectomy biopsy specimen rely criteria World Health Organization perform experienced GI pathologist blind polytectomy technique use endoscopic finding .</detailed_description>
