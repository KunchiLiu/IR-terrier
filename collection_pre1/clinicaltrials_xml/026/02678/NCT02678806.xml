	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma one ten lead cancer type worldwide also Asia , five-year relative survival rate relatively quite low1-3 . For hepatocellular carcinoma treatment , current option surgical resection , embolization chemotherapy , radiation therapy , variety ablation therapy , biological gene therapy , etc . Among , use radiation therapy get attention , change past palliative treatment current curable treatment . From oncologic point view , narrow margin &lt; 1 cm microvascular invasion safe often associate high rate recurrence short patient survival.On hand , also believe intrahepatic recurrence arise multicentric carcinogenesis distant resection margin . To address issue , investigator go conduct series retrospective prospective study investigate effect adjuvant Radiotherapy centrally locate hepatocellular carcinoma narrow margin ( &lt; 1 cm ) hepatectomy tumor recurrence .</brief_summary>
