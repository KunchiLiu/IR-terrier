	<brief_title>Functional Performance Evaluation NU-FlexSIV Socket</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose clinical trial assessor-blinded prospective randomize cross-over trial wherein participant unilateral transfemoral amputation randomize use one two socket condition ( i.e. , sub-ischial ischial containment ) cross socket condition . Random allocation ( computer-generated ) utilize block random size use assign initial treatment condition . The trial balance subject receive treatment ( i.e. , socket condition ) subject participate number period ( i.e. , two ) . While washout period strictly necessary , effectively include subject need transition back usual , pre-study socket/prosthesis second test socket fabricate . Allocation intervention conceal investigator subject enrol . The start socket design enclose sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope . Envelopes open sequentially participant 's name detail write appropriate envelope . Blinding prosthetic intervention challenge give device must custom-fabricated donned day subject . Hence , study assessor blind . The blinded assessor responsible administration clinical performance patient-reported measure well process motion analysis data .</detailed_description>
