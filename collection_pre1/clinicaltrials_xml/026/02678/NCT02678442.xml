	<brief_summary>This clinical trial compare two needle use biopsy technique acquire tissue pancreatic cancer . The hypothesis tissue yield , measure tumor DNA cellular material superior Flexible Needle Biopsy ( FNB ) compare conventional Fine Needle Aspiration ( FNA ) . Specifically , FNB increase proportion case sufficient DNA obtain allow genomic profiling whole exome sequencing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Fine Needle Biopsy ( EUS-FNB-SC ) Using Novel Fork Needle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-blinded randomized control trial pair evaluation conventional FNA needle versus FNB needle stratify lesion location ( pancreas head tumor versus pancreas body/tail ) . A minimum 4 pass ( 2 needle ) perform lesion . After pas needle , on-site cytopathologists evaluate adequacy degree pathological change obtain material . Based information provide onsite cytopathologists , endosonographer repeat FNA enough histological material obtain confirm diagnosis . Patients assess immediately procedure first 30 day follow-up .</detailed_description>
