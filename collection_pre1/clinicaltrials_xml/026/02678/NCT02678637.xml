	<brief_summary>Mitochondrial disorder group inherit disorder cause malfunctional mitochondrion . Mitochondria find every cell body , disorder therefore give symptom every tissue , especially high energy need brain , heart muscle . The disorder highly disable . The aim study investigate relation muscle strength contractile cross sectional area ( CCSA ) leg patient affect mitochondrial disease . The hypothesis disrupt relationship strength CCSA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mitochondrial disorder group inherit disorder cause mutation gene encode mitochondrial protein . The protein encode gene mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) nucleus , make disorder maternally inherit autosomal recessive dominant . The mitochondrion find almost cell body main source energy . The energy produce electron transport chain , compose four multi subunit complex ( I IV ) . A mutation one complex typical cause mitochondrial disease . Since mitochondrion find almost every cell , mitochondrial disease give rise symptom many organ . The symptom depend kind mutation patient , usually include muscular neurological problem , cell especially high energy need . It believe muscle weakness mitochondrial disease cause reduce ability produce energy . However , recent research suggest structural change muscle well . The hypothesis structural change muscle affect function . The aim study investigate relation muscle strength contractile cross sectional area ( CCSA ) calf patient affect mitochondrial disease . In healthy individual close relation strength CCSA , strength decrease accord decrease CCSA . In mitochondrial disease , hypothesis disrupt relationship strength CCSA . The investigator recruit 30 subject verify mitochondrial disease , compare result healthy individual ( result earlier research project ) . A Dixon MRI use find CCSA calf muscle muscle dynamometer use find strength . These two variable compare .</detailed_description>
