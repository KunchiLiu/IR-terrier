	<detailed_description>BMN 190 recombinant form human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 ( TPP1 ) , enzyme deficient patient CLN2 disease ( also know classical late-infantile CLN2 , cLINCL , Jansky-Bielschowsky disease ) , form Batten Disease . As enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) , BMN 190 design restore TPP1 enzyme activity . BMN 190 design reduce progressive , pathologic accumulation lysosomal storage material , improve symptom disease . 190-203 Phase 2 open-label study evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy BMN 190 patient sibling enrol 190-201 study . Study drug administration consist 300mg dosing administer via intracerebroventricular ( ICV ) infusion every week ( qow ) , duration 96 week .</detailed_description>
