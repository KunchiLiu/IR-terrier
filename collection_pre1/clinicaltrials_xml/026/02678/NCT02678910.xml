	<detailed_description>The research procedure conduct University Kentucky ( UK ) Medical Center and/or Norton Healthcare Facility Norton Hospital , Kosair 's Children 's Hospital Norton Cancer Institute . Participants study provide ovarian tissue cryopreservation personal use provide research pool ovarian tissue establish technology enable long-term preservation ovarian function . The study conduct collaboration NIH fund Oncofertility Consortium Northwestern University . The duration study participant reach age 41 year . Participants broken four category : Participants Categories 1-3 surgical removal ovarian tissue use method determine surgeon base medical/surgical diagnosis treatment . Participants undergo elective removal ovary ( Category 4 ) undergo procedure call laparoscopy remove ovary . This surgery perform general anesthesia one ovary remove total instrument channel employ standard technique operative laparoscopy . This surgical procedure perform solely fertility preservation potentially coordinate another procedure placement central line future chemotherapy laparotomy another purpose . Although one ovary remove , participant 's ovary must appear normal procedure complete . The ovary remove chosen time surgery base appearance ease removal . After surgery complete , participant procedure except routine post-operative visit . A 0.5 cm cross section short axis ovary provide Department Pathology routine histological evaluation , remain tissue process cryopreservation . If pathology find evidence cancer ovarian tissue provide surgery , may request participant 's tissue ( even tissue frozen use ) return pathology detailed examination . In case , tissue available participant use fertility preservation purpose Tissue collect national research repository Oncofertility Consortium intend direct use participant , advance science behind ovarian tissue cryopreservation transplantation . Participants elect take part portion study may still participate study store ovarian tissue future use . The tissue obtain research may therefore use : - Optimize technique freeze thaw ovarian tissue use transplant vitro follicle maturation ( IFM ) - Investigate factor affect successful maturation immature follicle obtain ovarian tissue include use 3-dimensional bio-gel scaffold , growth factor , hormone , culture condition - Determine efficacy ovarian tissue cryopreservation technique - Provide long term follow-up participant ovarian tissue frozen use b. Cryopreservation : Ovarian tissue cryopreserved National Physicians Cooperative Oncofertility Consortium . The ovarian tissue remove UK Norton Healthcare facility evaluate gross disease pathologist , embryologist , andrologist reproductive endocrinology infertility ( REI ) physician . The ovarian cortex dissect medulla cut strip culture/holding medium , wash remove blood cell , cryopreserved . Cryopreservation perform use modification technique describe Gosden et al . ( 1994 ) vitrify use modification technique Kuwayama et al. , 2007 . The procedure cryopreservation/vitrification may modify improvement become available . The designated laboratory director UK Norton Healthcare , Northwestern University responsible overall quality ovarian tissue cryopreservation . c. Tissue storage : Cryopreserved participant tissue transfer Reprotech , Ltd ( RTL ) Roseville , Minnesota storage subsequent release . Reprotech , Ltd. FDA compliant American Association Tissue Banks accredit long term storage facility reproductive tissue . Based extended period time tissue likely store Reprotech , Ltd. provide maximum flexibility participant involve . In way , participant store tissue long wish ship fertility treatment center choice time use . The participant determine tissue use technology change base unique circumstance . Reprotech , Ltd. perform fertility treatment affiliated fertility center potential conflict interest . Tissues designate research provide research laboratory Northwestern University via National Physicians Cooperative Oncofertility Consortium either fresh frozen . All research tissue de-identified ; participant identify number , name . No information participant identify release publish connection study . Only investigator co-investigators access file match participant tissue specimen number . All data store confidential database include Cancer Central Clinical Database ( C3D ) provide NIH National Cancer Institute Oncofertility Consortium . Data study location permanently store investigator co-investigators . d. Infectious Disease Screening Testing : Banking subsequent use ovarian tissue regulate Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . In order comply current tissue banking regulation prepare future change regulation ovarian tissue storage , participant test screened number infectious disease prior bank ovarian tissue.The test include limited test Hepatitis B C HIV . The testing perform test mandate donor leukocyte rich tissue must perform within 7 day tissue procurement . In way , tissue could potentially use participant could also suitable use another individual ( surrogate ) future indicate participant 's medical diagnosis . If ovarian tissue vaginally remove surgery site also collect vaginal swab participant Gonorrhea Chlamydia test . Please note HIV screen test positive , confirmatory test perform . Should screen test detect participant infect HIV information communicate confidentially personal contact qualify professional . Participants meet qualified professional provide HIV counseling . There risk associate study risk outline study inform consent document . Benefit vs. Risk : There guarantee participant get benefit take part study , although 26 baby bear transplanted frozen ovarian tissue . A females participation may provide mean restore fertility reproductive hormonal function future observe previous report . A females participation may also advance investigator 's understanding successfully freeze thaw ovarian tissue manner permit subsequent use participant patient point future . A females participation may also advance investigator 's knowledge successfully mature follicle oocyte ( egg ) contain tissue may help participant others future . However , significant possibility may direct benefit participant participation research study . Specifically , possibility ovarian cryopreservation result successful pregnancy future . There alternative take part study alternative address study inform consent document . Costs : All expense relate research procedure cover research fund include oophorectomy , anesthesia , pathologist 's fee infectious disease testing . If participant elect contribute tissue research pool time consent , later find enough tissue contribute research pool , charge cryopreservation . Either participant insurance company , Medicare Medicaid responsible cost care treatment participant would receive study would normally receive condition . These cost consider medically reasonable necessary part care receives take part study . This include confirmatory HIV test follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) test . There also cost associate handle , processing , ship storage ovarian tissue . Those cost outline study inform consent document . In unlikely event participant hurt injured participating study medical cost relate care treatment responsibility submit insurance . Also , University Kentucky Norton Healthcare pay wage may lose harmed study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Undergo standard care surgery , chemotherapy , drug treatment , and/or radiation treatment prevention medical condition malignancy expect result permanent complete loss subsequent ovarian function . Or , medical condition malignancy require removal part one ovary . May newly diagnose recurrent disease . Those enrolled time initial diagnosis eligible receive therapy view likely result complete permanent loss ovarian function . Participant undergoing elective removal ovary fertility preservation must two ovary . Participant already store cryopreserved ovarian tissue frozen state prior undergoing cancer treatment ( surgery , chemotherapy radiation ) eligible enrollment inform consent . Is candidate chooses utilize embryo oocyte banking . Psychological , psychiatric condition prevent give fully inform consent . Underlying medical condition significantly increase risk complication anesthesia surgery . Participants large cancerous mass ovary remove ; cryopreservation perform portion ovary . Blood test indicate participant enough eggs remain ovary .</criteria>
