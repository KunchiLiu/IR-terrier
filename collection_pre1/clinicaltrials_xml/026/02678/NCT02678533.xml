	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess feasibility Plerixafor use combination G-CSF ( Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor ) 5 Fanconi anemia patient mobilize collect sufficient number peripheral blood CD34+ cell peripheral blood apheresis , gene therapy study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobilization Collection Peripheral Blood Stem Cells Patients With Fanconi Anemia Using G-CSF Plerixafor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fanconi anemia autosomal recessive disease average survival around 24 year old . The number cell producted bone marrow decrease around 5-10 year old . Hematological symptom occur around 7 year old . 80 % patient Fanconi anemia clinical sign bone marrow failure first decade life . Generally macrocytosis first noticeable sign . Then lead thrombocytopenia , anemia pancytopenia . Epidemiologic study show nearly patient medullar aplasia 40 year old , first cause mortality . It must emphasize complication may occur simultaneously patient , joint therapeutic intervention need . There basic treatment . Some currently use treatment cure cytopenia . These treatment involve blood transfusion , oral androgen , hematopoietic growth factor administration , Epo G-CSF treat anemia neutropenia . These treatment curative . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation treatment able restore permanently hematopoiesis . However , treatment lead high level risk develop solid tumor complication . All data justify develop stem cell gene therapy treatment use lentiviral vector express wild-type FANCA gene CIBER promoter . Three study show potential number cell mobilized patient Fanconi anemia . The aim first , show administer G-CSF plerixafor may lead collect enough cell potentially perform gene therapy graft . Secondly study assess tolerance , stem cell ' mobilization kinetic collect cell ' biological feature . This study perform Necker Children Hospital . 8 patient enrolled order reach 5 treated patient analyse many injection day require reach cell ' number goal . Sequential blood sample patient draw monitor complete blood count ( CBC ) , platelet , CD34+ cell rate stem cell phenotype . The clinical biological data anonymously enter electronic case report investigator end study .</detailed_description>
