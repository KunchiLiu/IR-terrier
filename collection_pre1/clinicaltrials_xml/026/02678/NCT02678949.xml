	<brief_summary>The multiple breath washout ( MBW ) one pulmonary function test display flow gas concentration plot time , show exponential decay end-tidal gas concentration ( washout curve ) . A number index describe washout curve propose , commonly report Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) . This simple measure ventilation heterogeneity derive MBW , use challenge short action bronchodilator response inhale steroid , conductive airway acinar . Patients moderate severe asthma characterize abnormality , conductive acinar airway .

	<detailed_description>The method use measure lung function , spirometric test , generally reflect function airway high caliber elastic retraction lung . However , use clinical practice limit physiological variability inconsistency measurement , therefore value predictor peripheral obstruction question . The Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) simple measure ventilation heterogeneity derive multiple breath-washout ( MBW ) curve , use challenge short action bronchodilator inhale steroid , conductive acinar airway . Patients moderate severe asthma characterize abnormality , conductive acinar airway . The LCI one index derive concentration curve obtain MBW quantify inefficiency gas mixing lung . A phase III slope analysis MBW curve distinguish maldistribution ventilation due structural change ( acinar v conductive lung zone ) . The conductive MBW index ventilation heterogeneity relate proximal lung structure , convection dominates gas transport . The acinar MBW index ventilation heterogeneity related peripheral lung , convection-diffusion interaction occur . Therefore follow research question could : abnormality heterogeneity ventilation pediatric patient diagnosis asthma , mild moderate , respect healthy population , measure MBW whether alteration persist use conventional treatment inhale steroid B2 agonists short-acting . The general objetive identify change LCI ( heterogeneity ventilation ) retrieve MBW curve child diagnosis mild moderate asthma , challenge short-acting B2 agonists one month treatment knowledge dose inhale steroid . Specific objective ; 1. . Difference baseline result spirometry LCI ( derive form MBW curve ) , control health group , child mild moderate asthma . 2. . Changes LCI ( acinar conductive ventilation heterogeneity ) obtain MBW curve , baseline value challenge short-acting B2 agonist inhale steroid group patient mild moderate asthma . 3. . Determine whether alteration LCI patient mild moderate asthma originate acinar conductive airway . Methodology . The LCI calculate cumulative volume exhale ( CVE ) MBW test , divide functional residual capacity ( FRC ) . This index number turnover lung volume patient must breathe clean lung tracer gas ( 1/40th initial concentration ) . The expiratory N2 concentration plot volume change Total Lung Capacity ( TLC ) Residual Volume ( RV ) , slope ( dN2 ) N2 alveolar plateau calculate computer analysis best-fit line phase III expiratory volume-concentration curve . The measurement accept vital capacity ( VC ) MBW within 10 % VC . During MBW test , patient perform slow , full inspiratory expiratory VC maneuver inspiratory expiratory flow rate approximately 0.5 l/s.The VC obtain spirometry test . Design ; Clinical , control , parallel , longitudinal , comparative trial . Sample universe ; Patients sex 7-17 year age attend Pediatric Pulmonology Service Hospital Infantil de Mexico , diagnosis control mild moderate asthma . It include control group ( health child ) , criterion normality compare result spirometry LCI derive MBW curve obtain group , result study group patient mild moderate asthma . Inclusion criterion ; - For patient asthma : Informed write consent sign parent guardian patient assent sign patient . - For control group : Informed write consent sign parent guardian consent subject control appropriate , sign subject . - Patients 7 17 year age diagnosis mild moderate asthma accord criterion Global Initiative Asthma 2014 ( Global Strategy Asthma Management Prevention . National Institutes Health 2014 ) , treat inhaled steroid come outpatient clinic Pediatric Pulmonology Service Hospital Infantil de Mexico . - An evolution asthma &gt; 6 month . - Control subject ( healthy ) 7 17 , contact telephone accordance list count Laboratory Pulmonary Physiology participate study bioassay calibration equipment . - Able perform spirometry test multiple-breath washout . - No exacerbation asthma past 4 week . - Accept washout period ( without treatment ) 1 week realization study pulmonary function ( visit 2 ) . - Accept use short-acting B2 necesary reason . - Do suffer chronic disease , asthma . Exclusion criterion ; - Patient acute chronic pulmonary disease asthma . - Patient history asthma exacerbation 4 week prior inclusion study . - Patients diagnosis severe asthma accord criterion Global Initiative Asthma 2014 ( Global Strategy Asthma Management Prevention . National Institutes Health 2014 ) , - Other co-morbidities . Criteria elimination ; - Patients meet criterion acceptability repeatability spirometry , MBW interpretation accord American Thoracic Society . - Asthma exacerbation week washout period . - Removal informed consent . Sample size ; Taking account magnitude effect LCI MBW pediatric subject asthma , pre postbronchodilation basis clinical study carry previously ( Singer F , Abbas Ch , Yammine S , Casaulta C , Frey U , Latzin P. Abnormal small airway function child mild asthma . ) Chest 2014 ; 145 ( 3 ) : 492-499 ) . Where rate LCI prebronchodilator 2.96 ± 1.6 20 minute postbroncodilatador clearance rate 1.83 ± 1.24 . Considering magnitude effect rate LCI 1.13 , standard deviation 1.6 . With α = 0.05 ( bilateral ) , β = 0.20 , 80 % statistical power . The sample size 30 patient per group , take account great loss 20 % , sample size increase 35 subject per group . Selection patient sample distribution ; 3 group patient include : Group 1 ) Healthy group ( control ) . Group 2 ) Patients mild asthma treatment low dose inhaled steroid . Group 3 ) Patients moderate asthma treatment intermediatte dose inhaled steroid . Visit 1 . Explanation study . Review criteria inclusion . Signature case write informed consent . For Group 1 ; Only baseline spirometry MBW test perform . No intervention . For group 2 3 . Be ask suspend current medication 7 day ( washout period ) , indicate albuterol inhale necessary . Visit 2 ( 1 week Visit 1 ) . Groups 2 3 ; baseline spirometry MBW test . At end study , patient group receive one dose 400 mcg inhale albuterol spacer device . Twenty minute dose albuterol , repeat spirometry MBW test . After patient complete study , ask restart medication inhale steroid ; 100 mcg/day fluticasone group patient mild asthma ( Group 2 ) 200 mcg/day fluticasone moderate asthma patient group ( Group 3 ) . Visit 3 ( 4 week Visit 2 ) . Groups 2 3 ; basal spirometry MBW test . Statistical analysis . Descriptive statistic use obtain measure central tendency dispersion quantitative variable ( average , standard deviation 95 % confidence interval ) . It compare evaluate effect inhale steroid β2 agonist short action rate LCI distribution ventilation ( acinar conductive airway ) analysis Student 's related sample . The level significance establish p = ≤ 0.05 . Ethical Issues There procedure obtain approval Ethics Committee Hospital Infantil de México .</detailed_description>
