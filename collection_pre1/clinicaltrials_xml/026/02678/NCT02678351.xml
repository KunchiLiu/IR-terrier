	<brief_summary>This phase II/III trial study gallium 68 Ga ( 68Ga ) -prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ( PET/MRI ) find tumor patient prostate cancer undergo surgery tend spread quickly ( intermediate-risk ) likely come back spread ( high-risk ) . Diagnostic procedure , PET/MRI , may help find diagnose prostate cancer find far disease spread . Radioactive drug , gallium Ga 68-PSMA , bind tumor cell specific receptor , may allow doctor see small tumor standard care contrast-enhanced compute tomography ( CT ) MRI scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI detection regional nodal distant metastasis patient intermediate high-risk prostate cancer schedule undergo prostatectomy lymph node dissection . OUTLINE : Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA intravenously ( IV ) . Patients undergo PET/MRI 45 minute administration radiopharmaceutical injection . After completion study , patient follow 24-48 hour .</detailed_description>
