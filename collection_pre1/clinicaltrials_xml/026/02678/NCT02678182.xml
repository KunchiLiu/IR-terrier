	<brief_title>Planning Treatment Oesophago-gastric Cancer : Maintenance Therapy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open label , multicentre , randomise phase II clinical trial . An adaptive trial design propose allow ineffective treatment discontinue early , potentially add novel treatment arm trial progress . Patients initially receive standard chemotherapy locally advance metastatic oesophago-gastric adenocarcinoma , accord local practice base upon HER-2 status ( test locally ) . In order eligible trial entry , HER-2 negative patient receive platinum-fluoropyrimidine base chemotherapy doublet triplet ( Arm A ) , whilst HER-2 positive patient ( IHC 3+ IHC 2+ FISH positive ) receive cisplatin combination either capecitabine 5-FU ( CX CF ) plus trastuzumab chemotherapy ( Arm B ) . Potentially eligible patient register trial office whilst undergo first line chemotherapy . Patients become eligible trial recruitment randomization follow completion least 6 cycle standard chemotherapy ≥SD ( stable disease ) end-of-treatment CT scan . Eligible patient randomise accord HER-2 status follow : - HER-2 positive patient ( ~20 % ) currently randomise assign maintenance single-agent trastuzumab ( current UK standard ) , comparator arm development . - HER-2 negative patient ( ~80 % ) randomise 1:1:1 fashion surveillance ( current UK standard ) , maintenance capecitabine , maintenance immuno-modulatory therapy ( anti-PD-L1 antibody ) Patients stratify accord : locally advance disease versus metastatic disease , performance status ( 0 versus 1 versus 2 ) . Review patient occur every 4 week observation arm . In maintenance therapy arm , patient review every 3 every 4 week depend upon treatment strategy . CT assessment response occur every 12 week ( 3 month ) arm trial . Treatment continue indefinitely occurrence either disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient withdrawal another reason . The trial run RMH GI clinical trial unit Professor David Cunningham over-arching CI . Effective arm phase II portion trial may take forward phase III maintenance trial power overall survival . It also hop , robust data becomes available biomarker-selected population ( e.g . MET-positive , FGFR-amplified ) , may possible amend overall trial design incorporate biomarker-targeted maintenance therapy HER-2 negative population .</detailed_description>
