	<detailed_description>Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) affect person 's ability move feel sensation body . SCI also indirect cause persistent pain , call Central Neuropathic Pain ( CNP ) . This pain typically develop several month injury . In 30 % 40 % SCI patient , severe CNP affect everyday live include sleep mood . Medical treatment CNP moderately effective costly , patient health care system . In previous study , characteristic 'signatures ' brain wave related CNP define . Based , novel treatment CNP base neurofeedback develop clinically test five SCI patient . Electroencephalograph ( EEG ) use record patient ' brain wave show patient computer screen simple graphical form ( e.g . bar ) . Patients trained change brain activity , consequence , pain reduce . Costly laboratory device use study , adequate alternative could offer patient . In study , cheap , portable , wireless user friendly , Conformité Européenne ( CE ) mark EEG device use train 10 patient self-administer therapy comfort home . Participants give initial training use equipment ask use system home 3 month - initially , 3-5 time week , if/when pain subsides , least week require . The primary purpose study determine whether portable system neuromodulation useful tool administer therapy pain ( intensity pain measure visual numerical scale ( VNS ) ) . The secondary purpose study quantitative analysis change brain activity due therapy , measure EEG; patient ' perspective home base neuro-therapy ( assessed questionnaire one-to-one , semi-structured interview ) .</detailed_description>
