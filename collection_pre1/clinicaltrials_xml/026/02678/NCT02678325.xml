	<brief_summary>The objective study compare difference daily protein intake critically ill patient two standardized enteral nutrition formula ( 20 % versus 33 % percent ) caloric density 1.2 kcal/ml . The total amount protein take day four start early enteral feeding define primary endpoint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Basel Enteral High Protein Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For year , Surgical Intensive Care Unit University Hospital Basel use early enteral approach feed critically ill patient different formula high protein content ( 20 % total energy ) . However , energy goal first week 20 kcal normal-weight 12.5 kcal obese patient , result daily protein amount 0.8 1 g/kg bodyweight ( BW ) , additional protein administer . Due suggestion dietetic service University Hospital Basel , Fresenius Kabi produce whey base enteral feed formula intensive care patient . Specific adaptation patient group include micronutrient fatty acid profile well low fibre . Surgical Intensive Care Unit University Hospital Basel offer opportunity test formula clinical practice hypothesize specific high-protein ( 30 % energy ) enteral formula reach amount daily caloric intake high total daily amount protein equal intestinal tolerance compare usual intestinal nutritional formula . In order test hypothesis , investigator plan double-blind , randomize control study aim achieve target protein quantity ≥1.3 g/kg BW energy target 20kcal/kg BW per day , base new , specifically design formula critically ill patient . The amount protein day four start early enteral feeding define primary endpoint . Secondary endpoint total amount calorie , nitrogen balance day five well side effect like gastric residual content , diarrhoea constipation . Inclusion criterion expect stay ICU four day long admission 18 year age old Exclusion criterion consist BMI ≤ 18 , pregnancy , intestinal perforation , mechanical intestinal obstruction , terminal state consuming disease , severely impaired liver function noradrenaline ≥0.5µg/kg BW/min.. On purpose , 90 critically ill patient get either two enteral feeding product describe . In case event increase protein intake obtain protein-rich formula , additional study investigate influence early protein-rich nutrition skeletal muscle waste critically ill patient . In pre-study investigator administer high protein formula 20 patient test tolerance suitability nutritional Targets question . Tolerance define absence one follow clinical symptom : - Reflux - Diarrhoea - Constipation - Nausea - Vomiting</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patient ( age 18 year old ) expect stay ICU four day upon admittance longer expect enteral feed least four day . BMI ≤ 18 Mechanical intestinal obstruction Intestinal perforation Severely impaired liver function Terminal state consume disease Noradrenaline ≥0.5µg/kg BW/min Pregnancy</criteria>
