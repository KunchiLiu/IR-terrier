	<brief_summary>This study evaluate two group patient melanoma spread eye liver : one group ( 50 % ) get high-dose chemotherapy deliver specifically liver , group ( 50 % ) get one 4 standard best alternative care treatment . Patients group get repeat cycle treatment cancer liver advance follow death . This study evaluate effect treatment long patient live long take cancer advance respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion v Best Alternative Care Patients With Hepatic-dominant Ocular Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist 3 phase : screening phase , treatment phase , follow-up phase . Screening Phase : Screening assessment conduct within 28 day prior randomization determine patient 's overall eligibility . These assessment include medical history , physical examination , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) , 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , echocardiogram ( ECHO ) , vital sign , full hematology biochemistry , radiologic assessment disease status , evaluation vasculature compatibility Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion ( PHP ) . Treatment Phase : Eligible patient randomize treatment Melphalan/HDS 3.0 mg/kg Ideal Body Weight ( IBW ) Best Alternative Care ( BAC ) must begin treatment within 14 day follow randomization . BAC treatment : dacarbazine ( DTIC ) ; transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) ; ipilimumab ; pembrolizumab , base institution 's rank order BAC treatment base standard care ( SOC ) . For Melphalan/HDS treatment , patient receive 6 treatment . Each treatment cycle consist 6 week acceptable delay another 2 week next planned treatment allow recovery melphalan-related toxicity , need . Tumor response assess cohort every 12 week ( + 2 week ) hepatic disease progression . If patient receive 1 treatment , disease assessment scan conduct 12 week date first treatment . The assessment scan review Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) , also refer Independent Central Review . At time hepatic progressive disease ( PD ) observe , patient remove study treatment . Melphalan/HDS treatment also discontinue event recovery treatment related toxicity require 8 week last treatment . An end-of-treatment visit conduct approximately 6 8 week follow final dose study treatment . Ongoing adverse event ( AEs ) end-of-treatment visit follow severity return baseline CTCAE Grade &lt; 1 . The maximum possible duration study treatment patient 12 month . Follow-up Phase : In event disease progress end-of-treatment visit , disease assessment scan continue every 12 week ( + 2 week ) disease progression document . Patients contact phone every 6 month survival status first two year follow completion study treatment , yearly thereafter , death , withdrawal inform consent become lose follow-up , whichever occur first . Patients monitor two year , follow completion study treatment , development myelodysplasia secondary leukemia .</detailed_description>
