	<brief_title>Multi-center Phase I/IIa Trial Autologous Tumor Lysate ( TL ) + Yeast Cell Wall Particles ( YCWP ) + Dendritic Cells ( DC ) Vaccine Addition Standard Care Checkpoint Inhibitor Choice Metastatic Melanoma Patients With Stable Slowly Progressing Disease .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metastatic melanoma patient CPI monotherapy minimum 3 month stable slowly progress disease identify screen inclusion/exclusion criterion . Eligible patient counsel consented tissue procurement . They undergo excisional core needle biopsy clinically indicate , tissue ship liquid nitrogen shipper FedEx central facility Greenville , SC . The tumor store frozen vaccine preparation . Vaccine development require 48 hour preparation . Upon verification adequate tissue obtain , patient counsel consented participation trial . The patient qualify participation trial categorize base tumor 's response CPI monotherapy . These patient continue treatment CPI . Once consent , patient receive single injection Neupogen ( G-CSF ) 300 μg SQ 24-48 hr prior 70 mL blood collect sent central facility DC isolation preparation . Those tolerate Neupogen refuse 120 mL blood drawn send . Additional blood may draw additional vaccine dos need make re-made reason . Vaccines prepare produce TL freeze/thaw cycling load pre-prepared YCWP . The TL-loaded YCWP introduce DC phagocytosis thus create TLPLDC vaccine , frozen single dose vial . Each vial contain 1 x 106 TLPLDC label patient 's unique study number . The frozen autologous TLPLDC send back site total 6 single dose vial vaccine complete QA/QC test lot-release ( usually 3 week ) . The primary vaccination series include monthly inoculation 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 month follow booster 6 9 month lymph node drain area ( preferably anterior thigh ) . Once receive , first inoculation occur within 4 week . Safety data collect local systemic toxicity grade report per Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.03 . Patients follow-up respective site evaluation metastatic disease per SoC . They image , CT/PET-CT , meet Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria version 1.1 Guidelines Evaluation Immune Therapy Activity Solid Tumors monitor disease . Blood ( 50 mL ) collect patient prior inoculation 12 month enrollment total 7 time point total 350 mL blood 1 year . The collected blood send central facility immunologic test T-cell response .</detailed_description>
