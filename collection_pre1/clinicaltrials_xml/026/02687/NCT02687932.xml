	<detailed_description>Functional ischemic mitral regurgitation ( MR ) report occur 40 % patient myocardial infarction , prevalence functional MR likely increase age population improve survival rate myocardial infarction . The presence functional MR associate increase incidence heart failure death , patient significant functional MR incur two-fold increase risk mortality four-fold increase risk heart failure . Functional MR cause adverse leave ventricular remodel myocardial injury enlargement leave ventricle ( LV ) , apical lateral displacement papillary muscle , leaflet tethering reduce closing force . The leaflet normal secondary functional MR treatment considerably different functional primary MR . Surgery definitive therapy primary severe MR primary MR usually cure surgical valve repair . However , surgical indication unclear severe functional MR , outcomes surgery functional MR remain suboptimum . Operative mortality , long-term mortality heart failure rate still high patient severe functional MR despite surgical improvement . According current guideline , mitral valve surgery may consider severely symptomatic patient severe secondary functional MR persistent symptom despite optimal medical therapy heart failure . Because secondary functional MR usually develop result LV dysfunction , diuretic , beta blocker , angiotensin-converting-enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) , aldosterone antagonist give patient functional MR line guideline management heart failure . However , functional MR appear remain common despite use drug current medical treatment usually insufficient reduce MR reverse adverse LV remodeling . Persistence functional MR due insufficient effectiveness current medical treatment significantly increase morbidity mortality , compare surgical percutaneous revascularization , significantly high mortality observe patient manage medical therapy . Quantitative assessment MR strongly recommend guideline regurgitant volume effective regurgitant orifice area ( EROA ) MR measure accurately reproducibly Doppler echocardiography . The EROA MR important prognostic value primary secondary functional MR. Because functional MR carry adverse prognosis grade relationship MR severity reduce survival , therapy induce beneficial reverse remodel LV reduce MR , may improve survival . ACE inhibitor ARBs could partially attenuate LV dilatation remodel myocardial injury , publish data prospective trial regard whether attenuation remodel ACE inhibitor ARBs reduce functional MR. LCZ696 dual-acting inhibitor renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) neutral endopeptidase ( NEP ) . As LCZ696 offer therapeutic advantage concomitantly block RAAS NEP , LCZ696 effective reduce risk death cardiovascular cause hospitalization heart failure patient chronic heart failure ACE inhibitor . Because NEP involve metabolism number vasoactive peptide natriuretic peptide , NEP inhibitor vasodilating effect , facilitate sodium excretion profound effect LV remodel . Trials hypertension heart failure preserve ejection fraction also show LCZ696 great hemodynamic neurohormonal effect ARB alone . To date , proven pharmacological therapy improve functional MR , development medical therapy forefront research consider limited role surgery manage functional MR. Investigators hypothesize LCZ696 superior ARB alone improve functional MR patient LV dysfunction functional MR via synergistic effect NEP RAAS inhibition LV remodeling , try examine hypothesis multicenter , double-blind , randomize comparison study use echocardiography .</detailed_description>
