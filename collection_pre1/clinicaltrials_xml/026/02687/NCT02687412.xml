	<brief_summary>Fast-track surgery ( FTS ) pathway , also know enhanced recovery surgery ( ERAS ) , FTS multidisciplinary approach aim accelerate recovery , reduce complication , minimize hospital stay without increase readmission rate reduce healthcare cost , without compromise patient safety . It use successfully non-malignant gynecological surgery , proven especially effective elective colorectal surgery . However , consensus guideline develop gynecological oncology surgery although surgeon attempt introduce slightly modify FTS programme patient undergo surgery . NO randomise controlled trial . The advantage fast-track likely extend gynecology , although far scarcely report . There exist research show FTS gynecological oncology provide early hospital discharge gynaecological surgery meanwhile high level patient satisfaction . The aim study identify patient follow FTS program discharge earlier anticipated major gynaecological/gynaecological oncologic surgery analyze complication surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods/Design Comparison Fast-Track ( FT ) traditional management protocol . primary endpoint length hospitalization post-operation ( , mean±SD ) . It calculate difference date discharge date surgery . The secondary endpoint complication group assess first 21 day postoperatively . Including infection ( wound infection , lung infection , intraperitoneal infection , operation space infection ) , postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) , ileus , postoperative hemorrhage , postoperative thrombosis APACHE II score . The advantage fast-track likely extend gynecology , although far scarcely report . NO randomised control trial . The aim study compare LOS ( Length hospitalization post-operation ) major gynaecological/gynaecological oncologic surgery analyze complication surgery . This trial show whether FTS program achieve early hospital discharge gynaecological surgery meanwhile low level complication .</detailed_description>
