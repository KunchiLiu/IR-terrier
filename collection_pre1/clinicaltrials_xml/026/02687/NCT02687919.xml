	<brief_summary>This research study . The investigator invite participant participate research study age 18-45 , stable Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ( RRMS ) , able walk 25 ft with/without assistive device , none following : liver disease , kidney disease , diabetes , active heart disease , heart block arrhythmia , bleed disorder , concurrent diuretic use , anti-coagulation anti-platelet use , psychosis psychiatric disorder likely impact ability comply study procedure , change prescription medication mental health problem depression anxiety last three month . The purpose research study determine whether modified Paleolithic diet result change health person RRMS compare usual care . The investigator define usual care typical usual physician recommendation treatment RRMS . The Paleolithic diet ( Paleo diet ) , also refer caveman diet , Stone Age diet , hunter-gatherer diet , modern nutritional plan base presumed ancient diet wild plant animal ancestral human Paleolithic era ( period 2.5 million year duration end around 10,000 year ago development agriculture ) . The diet consist mainly fish , grass-fed pasture raise meat , vegetable , fruit , fungi , root , nut , excludes grain , legume , dairy product , salt , refine sugar , process oil . To investigator ' knowledge , neurologist prescribe medication may reduce prevent future disability , prescribe dietary modification unless need concomitant disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Initial visit/baseline measure intervention control group ( 1-2 hr ) : Subject Info Demographics , Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) , Blood draw ( vitamin B-1 ( thiamine ) , vitamin B-9 ( folate ) , vitamin B-12 ( cobalamin ) , vitamin K , homocysteine , C-reactive protein ) , MS Functional Composite ( MSFC ) [ Timed 25-Foot Walk ( T25-FW ) , 9-Hole Peg Test ( 9-HPT ) , Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ( PASAT ) ] , 6-minute walk , Paced Visual Serial Addition Test ( PVSAT ) . Complete home/office/other : Automated Self-Administered 24-hour recall application ( ASA24 ) . Two-week run-in intervention control group : Return survey instrument : [ Multiple Sclerosis Quality Life-54 ( MSQOL-54 ) , Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire ( VSAQ ) , Medication , Vitamin , Supplement Log , Food Diary ] . Randomization ; train intervention control group ( 1-2 hr ) . Training intervention group involve orientation subject modify paleo diet food logging ; control group train consist study expectation ( maintenance normal diet ) food logging . Both conduct research team member , subject , individual basis . Begin 3-month study : 1 short follow-up call per week , first three week , every week thereafter ask intervention control group subject need assistance study procedure provide assistance needed/possible ensure subject accurately maintain daily food log/diary ( 5 min ; could longer/shorter depend subject need ) . If subject ( intervention control arm ) difficulty fill Food Log/Food Diary , he/she opportunity meet research team member location subject 's choosing ( include web-conferencing ) supplemental instruction . At 1 month day return final visit , complete home/office/other : Automated Self-Administered 24-hour recall application ( ASA24 ) . Final visit* intervention control group ( 1-2 hr ) : Multiple Sclerosis Quality Life-54 ( MSQOL-54 ) , Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) , Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire ( VSAQ ) , Medication , Vitamin , Supplement Log , Food Log , Blood draw ( vitamin B-1 ( thiamine ) , vitamin B-9 ( folate ) , vitamin B-12 ( cobalamin ) , vitamin K , homocysteine , C-reactive protein ) , MS Functional Composite ( MSFC ) [ Timed 25-Foot Walk ( T25-FW ) , 9-Hole Peg Test ( 9-HPT ) , Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ( PASAT ) ] , 6-minute walk , Paced Visual Serial Addition Test ( PVSAT ) . *End participation intervention group cross-over ( control 3-month intervention ) interest control group subject . If regular in-person meeting possible ( two-week recall and/or supplemental instruction ) , subject may choose communicate research staff via web conferencing application ( Google Hangout ) .
