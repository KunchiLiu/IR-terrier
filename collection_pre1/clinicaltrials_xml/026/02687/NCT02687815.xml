	<brief_summary>This study determine whether vitamin D3 prevents severe asthma attack child serum vitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) level &lt; 30 ng/ml treat inhaled corticosteroid asthma . Half participant receive vitamin D3 dose 4,000 IU/day , half receive placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Results experimental study , observational study , two small trial suggest vitamin D reduce risk severe asthma exacerbation , protective effect may due immune modulation viral illness and/or increase response inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) . On basis finding , investigator hypothesize vitamin D reduces incidence severe asthma exacerbation high-risk school-aged child serum vitamin D level &lt; 30 ng/ml treated ICS persistent asthma . The investigator hypothesize protective effect result reduce incidence common viral illness enhance response ICS . These hypothesis test 48-week randomized double-masked placebo-controlled trial vitamin D3 supplementation prevent severe asthma exacerbation 400 child age 6 14 year vitamin D insufficiency deficiency ( serum 25 ( OH ) D &lt; 30 ng/ml ) experience severe exacerbation prior year ( marker high risk subsequent event ) , ( run-in period ) well control medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid . Our primary aim determine whether vitamin D3 ( 4,000 IU/day ) reduce risk severe asthma exacerbation ( primary outcome ) participate child . Secondary aim determine efficacy vitamin D3 supplementation : 1 ) prevent severe asthma exacerbation due viral infection , 2 ) reduce daily average cumulative dose inhale corticosteroid .</detailed_description>
