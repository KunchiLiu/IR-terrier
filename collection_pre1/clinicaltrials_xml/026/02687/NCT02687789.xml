	<brief_summary>Bacterial Vaginosis ( BV ) common infectious disorder characterize disturbance vaginal microbiological milieu . Anaerobic bacteria , Gardnerella vaginalis Atopobium vagina overgrow physiologic vaginal flora dominate Lactobacilli . BV arise remit spontaneously often present recurrent disease . New finding indicate presence adherent bacterial biofilm vaginal mucosa seem reason recurrence BV well overgrowth condition anaerobic bacteria . Biofilms define structured consortium bacteria embed matrix extracellular polymeric substance ( EPS ) . The purpose study achieve substantial result respect tolerability safety , gain knowledge clinical efficacy Vaginal suppository WO3191 , investigation perform parallel-design , double-blind , randomise , control manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Efficacy Vaginal Suppository WO3191 Post-treatment Bacterial Vaginosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation multicentre , parallel-group , double-blind , controlled trial open Follow-up Phase 12 week . It conduct gain clinical experience knowledge certify medical device Vaginal suppository WO3191 woman bacterial vaginosis . In investigation Investigational Medical Device ( IMD ) use post-treatment follow standard therapy oral metronidazole BV . IMD apply 2 time week 3 week . The primary purpose evaluation safety local tolerability WO3191 , therefore adverse event ( AEs ) adverse device effect ( ADEs ) document . Furthermore , patient ask possibly arise subjective vaginal symptom ( burn , itch , bleeding , pain , dryness ) examine possibly arise objective vaginal finding ( redness , petechial bleeding , dryness , swell ) . The secondary purpose investigation gain clinical experience knowledge Vaginal suppository WO3191 respect efficacy post-treatment bacterial vaginosis . In addition pH-values microbiological data shall examine . Furthermore , difference Vaginal suppository WO3191 ( Group A ) comparator ( Vagisan® Lactic Acid , group B ) respect safety , tolerability efficacy post-treatment bacterial vaginosis shall evaluate exploratively . Patients complete regular visit ( Visit 1 - 4 ; Visit 1 - Screening , Visit 2 - Randomization , Start application IMD ; Visit 3 - one week Visit 2 ; Visit 4 - two week Visit 3 , End application IMD ) investigation shall attend observational Follow-up Phase 12 week final Visit 5 . At Visit 5 recurrence BV well sustainability efficacy Vaginal suppository WO3191 evaluate .</detailed_description>
