	<brief_summary>Rationale Aim : The standard treatment acute appendicitis child appendectomy . An increase body evidence adult literature suggest acute appendicitis may treat effectively antibiotic alone , avoid need surgery . The aim study investigate effectiveness non-operative treatment acute appendicitis child . Study design : Pragmatic , parallel-group , unmasked , non-inferiority multicentre randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Patient allocation : Children randomly allocate ( age 5-16 year ) diagnosis acute appendicitis either laparoscopic appendectomy treatment antibiotic . Randomization perform use stratification ensure equal distribution group present clinical demographic feature may influence outcome include gender , duration symptom center . Interventions : One group child undergo laparoscopic appendectomy current standard treatment child acute appendicitis . The group treat intravenous antibiotic . A treatment pathway specifically design study use . Primary Outcome : To meaningful parent , clinician treat , child acute appendicitis , primary outcome treatment failure define : ( ) additional intervention relate appendicitis require general anesthesia within 1 year randomization ( include recurrence appendicitis non-operative treatment , treat appendectomy ) ( ii ) negative appendectomy . Secondary outcome : ( ) complication ; ( ii ) time discharge follow randomization ; ( iii ) number duration hospital admission . Sample size data analysis : The propose RCT 20 % non-inferiority margin test null hypothesis treatment antibiotic inferior appendectomy . Based data collaborate center pilot study perform , expect recruitment 978 child total ( 90 % power ) 19 month allow drop . Follow-up 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Appendectomy Versus Non-Operative Treatment For Acute Non-Perforated Appendicitis Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Acute appendicitis commonest surgical emergency child . The lifetime risk develop appendicitis 7-8 % , peak incidence teenage years.The associate financial burden treat appendicitis large . For 100 year , surgical removal appendix deem necessary effectively treat acute appendicitis . Appendectomy remain cornerstone treatment acute appendicitis , exception phlegmon appendix mass . However , recent year surgical dogma challenge grow literature suggest antibiotic without surgery may effective treatment acute appendicitis adult recently child . However non-operative management acute appendicitis remain controversial unproven due lack large prospective randomize controlled trial . Although appendectomy generally simple procedure , require general anesthesia abdominal operation inherent risk potential complication . Complications related surgery anesthesia event occur 10 % child within 30 day appendectomy . Although non-operative approach may avoid risk reduce complication rate , would viable alternative surgery unless equally effective cure acute appendicitis . The exist literature relate efficacy non-operative treatment acute appendicitis predominantly adult patient . Several trial systematic review report . A recent meta-analysis conclude benefit non-operative treatment include few complication , good pain control , short sick leave combine failure recurrence rate patient treat non-operatively make approach less effective overall . In child , literature limit . The significant study : Abes et al [ 6 ] describe successful , non-operative treatment 15 16 child short duration illness , minimal diagnostic criterion image ; Armstrong et al [ 7 ] report 75 % success rate 12 child treat non-operatively along matched comparison group undergo surgery ; two RCTs USA compare appendectomy antibiotic treatment child perforate appendicitis [ 8,9 ] ( different patient group one intend study ) ; single centre , preference-based , non-randomized study compare laparoscopic appendectomy antibiotic treatment [ 10 ] report interim result . In preparation multi center RCT , investigator perform pilot RCT one participating center ( Karolinska Institute , Stockholm ) [ 11 ] . Successfully demonstrated feasibility recruitment RCT safety non-operative treatment child acute appendicitis . Based observation , response parent ask whether child acute appendicitis really need operation , randomize control trial compare appendectomy non-operative treatment child acute appendicitis do . The principal research question : Can child acute uncomplicated ( non-perforated ) appendicitis treat without appendectomy ? Rationale Trial This trial potential significantly alter clinical practice one common acute health condition child . A finding non-inferiority treatment antibiotic compare appendectomy would transformative healthcare child acute appendicitis Canada abroad , include low- middle-income country . Reducing need surgery treatment childhood appendicitis represent potential cost saving healthcare system , enable improved access child non-emergent condition await surgery . Methods/Design Research question Can child acute non-perforated appendicitis treat antibiotic , rather appendectomy ? Trial design The APPY trial design pragmatic , parallel-group , unmasked , non-inferiority multicentre , international randomize control trial . The protocol develop accordance SPIRIT guideline trial conduct report accord CONSORT statement . Participants Children ( 5-16 year age ) suspect acute uncomplicated appendicitis enrol 16 hospital across Europe North America . All center specialist Pediatric Surgery Referral Centers train Specialist Pediatric Surgeons Pediatric Surgery Training Programs . All child suspect acute non-perforated appendicitis assess on-call surgeon determine eligibility study . This base clinical and/or ultrasound diagnosis acute non-perforated appendicitis . The patient child inform trial invited participate . Randomization After sign informed consent , standardize data set collected participant participate institution . Patients enrol study randomize group ( 1:1 ratio ) use online stratify randomization tool , allow instant assignment treatment group 24 hour per day concealment allocation . Allocation group stratify take account factor may affect outcome treatment : 1 ) Sex : Male ; Female ; 2 ) Duration symptom &lt; 48hrs ; &gt; 48hrs ; 3 ) Center . Interventions Patients allocate non-operative antibiotic treatment appendectomy . Non-operative treatment group : Participants allocate non-operative treatment treat accord treatment pathway standardize across center comprise intravenous fluid treatment , minimum 12 hour intravenous antibiotic , minimum period 12 hour take clear fluid , regular clinical review . During next clinical round , alternatively approximately 12 hour randomization , review clinical symptom conduct detect symptom sign significant clinical deterioration include , limited , increase fever , increase tachycardia , increase pain tenderness . If patient well , may advance regular diet assess discharge work day , depend clinical progression . If stable without deterioration improve point discharge continue non-operative management . A patient improve 48 hour non-operative management undergo appendectomy . All decision make treat physician care team consideration input parent child appropriate . Children non-operative treatment successful receive minimum 12 hour intravenous antibiotic switch oral antibiotic show clinical improvement . They discharge home meet standardize set criterion use center : vital sign ( include temperature ) within normal limit , tolerate light diet orally , adequate oral pain relief mobile . They receive total course 10 day antibiotic ( intravenous oral ) follow randomization . Children within non-operative treatment group remain care attend pediatric surgeon retain overall responsibility care . If child 's clinical condition deteriorates time , undergo laparoscopic appendectomy , receive post-operative care identical child appendectomy treatment group ( see ) , care might dictate sound clinical judgement . The choice antibiotic vary center antibiotic regimen current standard care center . This due ( ) vary antibiotic regime among participate center present influenced local factor , include antimicrobial stewardship drug cost ( 26 ) ( ii ) lack evidence support specific antibiotic regimen childhood appendicitis . Allowing center maintain current antibiotic protocol improve study feasibility increase generalizability result . However , duration combine intravenous oral therapy standardize 10 day . Following discharge , child receive non-operative treatment offer elective appendectomy . They counsel risk recurrence part permission process trial use best available current data . Recurrence appendicitis within 1 year follow-up period treat appendectomy ; child eligible re-enrollment . Appendectomy group : Children allocate appendectomy undergo laparoscopic appendectomy within approximately 18 hour randomization current standard care center participate study . Participants receive intravenous antibiotic time randomization treat post-operatively intravenous antibiotic accord defined standardized treatment regime base consensus trial . Specifically , child macroscopically normal appendix non-perforated acute appendicitis receive antibiotic . Children perforate appendicitis continue receive intravenous antibiotic minimum 3 day , may receive additional antibiotic per local practice . The type antibiotic use center identical use non-operative treatment group . Following cessation intravenous antibiotic , criterion discharge home identical non-operative treatment group .</detailed_description>
