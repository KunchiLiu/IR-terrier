	<brief_title>Does Immunogenicity Have Influence Efficacy Anti-TNF Therapy Patients With AS : An Inception Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease predominantly affect sacroiliac joint spine . It prototype spondyloarthritides ( SpA ) one common rheumatic disease . Sacroiliitis early manifestation disease accompany spinal involvement cause inflammatory back pain ( IBP ) . IBP usually start insidiously early adulthood typically felt deep buttock and/or low lumbar region . It improve activity return rest usually accompany morning stiffness last least 30 minute . Involvement spine patient AS usually limited sacroiliac joint lumbar region usually extend thoracic cervical segment . Currently sign diagnostic AS radiographic sacroiliitis . However radiography detect structural change take ten year appear unequivocally . In patient bone tenderness due enthesitis may primary complaint . Arthritis hips shoulder occur patient associated bad prognosis . Typical arthritis pattern AS patient asymmetric usually involve low extremity joint . There several extra-articular feature AS common acute anterior uveitis . Until recently treatment option AS limited base non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , traditional disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) rheumatoid arthritis physical therapy . The last decade witness major advance AS therapy use anti-tumor necrosis factor ( anti-TNF ) agent . Anti-TNF agent substantial effect axial disease also peripheral arthritis , enthesitis extra-articular feature ( like psoriasis inflammatory bowel disease ) . Currently four anti-TNF agent approve AS : ( 1 ) infliximab monoclonal chimeric antibody give dose 5 mg/kg every 6-8 week ; ( 2 ) etanercept human TNF receptor fusion protein administer subcutaneously dose 50 mg/once week ; ( 3 ) adalimumab humanize monoclonal antibody administer subcutaneous injection dose 40 mg fortnightly ; ( 4 ) golimumab fully human monoclonal antibody administer subcutaneously dose 50 mg month . Since head-to-head study compare anti-TNF agent treatment AS patient rank prescription anti-TNF agent . Mixed treatment comparison ( statistical model allow simultaneous multiple meta-analysis different pair-wise comparison ) infliximab , adalimumab etanercept show statistically significant difference . Indeed similar improvement Bath ankylose spondylitis activity index ( BASDAI 50 ) score ASAS partial remission ( 45.2 % 51.0 % BASDAI 50 22.1 % 22.4 % partial remission ) report randomize controlled clinical trial . Although many AS patient respond well anti-TNF therapy , considerable amount additionally significant proportion patient stop treatment . In clinical practice report 1-year 2-year drug survival rate anti-TNF agent 70-85 % 60-75 % , respectively.Moreover substantial proportion patient either increase administered dosage dose frequency become necessary . Therefore factor , predict response relate primary secondary non-response anti-TNF treatment grow attention among treat specialist . In study provide overview clinical trial observational study show increase acute phase reactant , high disease activity , functional status , young age , HLA-B27 positivity independent baseline predictor response anti-TNF treatment increase acute phase reactant , presence peripheral arthritis , male sex predictor long-term drug survival . Immunogenicity refers development antibody adaptive immune system response foreign substance . The development anti-drug antibody extensively study rheumatoid arthritis show anti-drug antibody vary impact clinical efficacy depend whether antibody neutralize non-neutralizing . Recent review demonstrate neutralizing antibody associate reduced chance achieve minimal disease activity clinical remission , decrease drug survival , increase dose escalation adverse drug reaction RA patient . However data regard immunogenicity patient treat AS scarce somewhat controversial . In small study include 38 AS patient treated infliximab de Vries et al show anti-infliximab antibody find significantly often ( 59 % vs 5 % ) mean serum infliximab level significantly low ASAS20 non-responders . In above-mentioned study infusion reaction also seem associated development anti-drug antibody . In another study de Vries et al ( 26 ) find antibody etanercept similar serum etanercept level responder non-responder AS patient ( n=53 ) . Same group also observe anti-adalimumab antibody become detectable 31 % AS ( n=35 ) patient 6 month period correspond diminished serum drug level . Arends et al report 0 30 % AS patient ( n=60 ) develop anti-drug antibody one year follow-up anti-TNF treatment patient anti-IFN anti-ADA antibody significantly low drug serum level . The objective prospective cohort study evaluate influence serum drug level development anti-drug antibody clinical response anti-TNF agent . The assessment demographic , clinical laboratory variable associate development anti-TNF drug antibody baseline disease course also evaluate . Via study , might also possible reveal impact anti-drug antibody long-term efficacy safety particular drug survival AS patient treat daily clinical practice .</detailed_description>
