	<brief_title>Safety Efficiency Study Pioglitazone Combination With Imatinib Mesylate Treat Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although tyrosine-kinase inhibitor profoundly convert outcome chronic myelogenous leukemia patient , could complete cytogenetic response , large majority patient could come complete molecular response undetectable breakpoint cluster region-Abelson chimeric oncogene transcript . According previous research , pioglitazone may target leukemia stem cell induce cell cycle make exit quiescent undivided state . Subsequently , pioglitazone may gradually erode leukemia stem cell lead undetectable minimal residual disease . Thus investigator expect assess safety efficiency pioglitazone combination imatinib mesylate clinical trial . Maybe combination therapy induce patient detectable molecular response deeper molecular response . Furthermore , pioglitazone may extensively adapt treatment chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia patient common protocol .</detailed_description>
