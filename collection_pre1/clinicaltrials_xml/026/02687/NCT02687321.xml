	<brief_title>The Role HE4 Follow-up Advanced Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer ( OC ) second common gynaecologic cancer lead cause death gynaecologic malignancy among woman industrialize country . The global incidence develop develop country estimate 165,000 new case per year . A heavy difference prognosis exist early-stage disease FIGO I-II ( International Federation Gynaecology Obstetrics advance stage ( FIGO III-IV ) . Unfortunately , present , effective screening strategy malignancy ; ( 70-80 % ) case diagnose advanced-stage disease , explain high mortality rate . These aggressive feature OC encourage recent year big effort order find new strategy early diagnosis OC . These study focus dominant new marker diagnostic algorithm among new marker . HE4 one promising . It protein initially identify epithelium distal epididymis may involve sperm maturation . Despite wide distribution , overexpressed pathological tissue , demonstrate good sensitivity specificity detect OC , overcome traditional role CA-125 . Despite aggressive upfront treatment strategy ( surgery plus chemotherapy ) , lead clinical remission 80 % patient , relapse-free survival varies 95.8 % ( early FIGO stage ) 33.6 % ( advanced stage ) 2 year . At present , periodical evaluation CA-125 combine physical examination recommend strategy OC follow-up , typically every 3 4 month first 2 year primary treatment every 6 month fifth year . Five year ' overall survival rate , however , 49.7 % ( range 83 % -89 % stage I OC 18 % stage IV ) . New marker test follow-up patient OC improve surveillance program performance : challenge try anticipate diagnosis OC recurrence translate early diagnosis relapse survival improvement . Few study available date HE4 use follow ovarian cancer . All study analyze small number woman ( 8-73 ) . HE4 show earlier indicator recurrence OC respect CA-125 , lead-time 5 8 month . Only 1 prospective control study publish . In study sensitivity specificity HE4 , alone association marker ( CA-125 , CA-72-4 ) , seem high diagnosis OC relapse respect CA-125 alone . The side question whether patient advantage earlier detection recurrent disease , term overall survival , disease-free survival , quality life . Early detection treatment cancer general recurrence usually associate good outcome patient , rationale behind screen program follow-up strategy . In OC follow-up , periodical CA-125 evaluation detect recurrence cancer 5 month clinical sign symptom . At time , remind , treatment relapse OC rarely curative heavy adverse effect , elevation CA-125 often cause anxiety patient undergoing follow-up . The main study , try clarify role CA-125 OC follow-up MRC OV05/EORTC ( European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer ) 55955 trial randomize study compare early versus delay treatment woman relapse OC . Patients delayed treatment group treat clinical symptomatic relapse . Women assign early treatment start chemotherapy 4.8 month earlier allocate delayed treatment . With median follow-up 56.9 month , evidence difference overall survival 2 group . In particular , result provide evidence improve overall survival well quality life early treatment group . The author ' explanation finding lead-time CA-125 rise clinical recurrence could short chemotherapy give beneficial effect . At present , periodical evaluation CA-125 combine physical examination recommend strategy OC follow-up , typically every 3 4 month first 2 year primary treatment every 6 month fifth year . Five year ' overall survival rate , however , 49.7 % ( range 83 % -89 % stage I OC 18 % stage IV ) .</detailed_description>
