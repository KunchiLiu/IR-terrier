	<brief_title>Study Everolimus Maintenance Therapy Metastatic NEC With Pulmonary Gastroenteropancreatic Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A platinum base chemotherapy ( Cisplatin Carboplatin ) plus Etoposide standard care NEC originate gastro-intestinal tract lung , base retrospective study . In clinical study clinical practice median number cycle administer six due dose depend toxicity platinum concept maximum response . The expression mTOR pathway evaluate gastroenteropancreatic - Neuroendocrine tumor ( GEP-NEC ) . The Investigator find 6/9 ( 67 % ) poorly differentiate GEP-NEC evaluate express p mTOR . Interestingly expression observe small cell carcinoma ( 10 ) . Recently , demonstrate mTOR pathway overexpressed NEC ( 11 ) . Based activity Everolimus treatment patient well moderately differentiate p-NET evidence even poorly differentiate form express pathway m-TOR conceivable Everolimus could active even NEC . In particular want test hypothesis maintenance therapy ( early second line ) Everolimus 10 mg/daily non progressive patient first line chemotherapy could improve outcome prolong progression free survival ( PFS ) . The NORDIC NEC study recently publish retrospectively analyzed 305 patient metastatic GI NEC ( unknown primary predominantly GI metastasis ) . In large retrospective study patient Ki-67 &lt; 55 % le responsive platinum base chemotherapy longer survival patient Ki-67 &gt; 55 % ; Ki-67 &lt; 55 % positive prognostic factor negative predictive factor platinum base chemotherapy ( 7 ) . These data indicate GI-NEC might consider unique entity , even classify G3 accord WHO 2010 classification . In randomized Phase 2 trial investigator want evaluate activity Everolimus 10 mg/daily maintenance therapy patient NEC Ki-67 &lt; 55 % . In fact subgroup NEC patient could benefit mostly maintenance treatment Everolimus 10 mg/daily since less chemo responder show well prognosis G1-G2 NET . There standard second line therapy NEC patient treat platinum base doublet , nevertheless Temozolamide Capecitabine ( TX ) represent regimen use set , base small retrospective series ( 8 ) . Therefore study recommend patient first progression ( even study ) receive TX ( Capecitabine 750 mg/m2 po BID day 1-14 plus Temozolomide 200 mg/m2 po quaque die ( QD ) day 10-14 q28 ) order homogenize second line treatment . However , second line treatment choose single investigator . The aim study evaluate activity maintenance therapy ( early second line ) Everolimus 10 mg daily patient stable disease , partial response complete response 6 cycle induction chemotherapy Cisplatin Carboplatin plus Etoposide alternative first line chemotherapy administer accord clinical practice . The primary endpoint progression free survival ( PFS ) define time randomization first evidence progressive disease date death , whichever occur first . Documentation disease progression define per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) criterion base investigator assessment . The censor date patient know progression-free would date last tumor assessment . Secondary objective : - Overall survival ( OS ) define time randomization death cause - Safety profile : Safety treatment evaluate serious non serious adverse event ( AEs ) . AEs grade accord Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE v4.03 ) - Evaluation prognostic/predictive factor tumoral tissue patient treat maintenance everolimus 10 mg/daily . The expression mTOR kinases involve pathway assessed immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) - Detection count circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) peripheral blood sample VERIDEX® correlation CTCs number outcome patient term PFS OS - Detection circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) correlation ctDNA level outcome patient term PFS OS . Evaluation mTOR pathway gene mutation ctDNA This study population comprise subject diagnose GEP-NEC large-cells neuroendocrine carcinoma Lung Ki67 &lt; 55 % stable disease , partial complete response 6 cycle first line chemotherapy . Adverse Event : An AE noxious , unintended , untoward medical occurrence may appear worsen subject course study . It may new intercurrent illness , worsen concomitant illness , injury , concomitant impairment subject 's health , include laboratory test value ( specify criterion ) , regardless etiology . Any worsening ( i.e. , clinically significant adverse change frequency intensity preexist condition ) consider AE . A diagnosis syndrome record AE page case report form ( CRF ) rather individual sign symptom diagnosis syndrome . Disease progression report AE . An overdose , accidental intentional , whether associate AE , abuse , withdrawal , sensitivity toxicity investigational product report AE . If overdose associate AE , overdose adverse event report separate term . All subject monitor AEs study . Assessments may include monitor follow parameter : subject 's clinical symptom , laboratory , pathological , radiological surgical finding , physical examination finding , appropriate test procedure . All AEs record Investigator time subject sign inform consent least 30 day last dose CT last study visit , whichever period longer . Adverse Events serious adverse event ( SAEs ) record AE page CRF subject 's source document . All SAEs must report PIs within 24 hour Investigator 's knowledge event facsimile , appropriate method , use SAE Report Form , approve equivalent form . All SAEs also report Novartis safety desk within 15 day learn . Serious adverse event summarize . Safety analysis : All pat receive least 1 dose study drug evaluate safety toxicity . Adverse event ( AE ) term severity grade assign investigator use CTCAE v. 4.03 . Safety analyse include listing and/or summary follow : - Treatment emergent adverse event ( TEAEs ) , include seriousness , severity possible relationship study drug - Dose adjustment - CTCAE grade laboratory non laboratory parameter Number Patients : Thirty pt ( 20 experimental arm 10 control arm ) randomize Statistical method : This open-label study . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrollment allow enroll study . Those patient enter study trial allocate arm A arm B . Assignment treatment determine prior Cycle 1 d1 use interactive response system mail central location . Patients sequentially allocate arm A arm B 1:2 ratio . This phase II study power statistical comparison arm A B . The number patient sufficient exploratory analysis activity Everolimus maintenance therapy set patient . Only result analysis encouraging , second step study power comparison arm A B .</detailed_description>
