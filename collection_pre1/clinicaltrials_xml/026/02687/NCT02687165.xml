	<brief_title>Uncovering Neural Immune Mechanisms Chronic Pain Post Treatment Lyme Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At least 5-15 % patient Lyme disease ( 7,500-45,000 new case year ) develop Post-treatment Lyme Syndrome ( PTLS ) - debilitate residual symptom last month year , even receive antibiotic treatment . Often patient PTLS experience chronic pain muscle joint nerve . Because many PTLS patient pain persists despite antibiotic know medicine modulate pain pathway brain help reduce eliminate pain , plan treat patient medicine FDA approve treatment pain . This medicine know Milnacipran ( trade name `` Savella '' ) ; medicine addictive show reduce chronic pain multiple action pain pathway . All patient study treated FDA approve medicine . Second , wish test whether pain improve even add medicine know modulate glutamate transmission involve pain brain . This medicine - D-Cycloserine - actually antibiotic , currently FDA approve treatment tuberculosis . Because action glutamate receptor , hypothesize help decrease pain even patient Lyme-related pain . In order test hypothesis , 6 week Milnacipran , patient give additional treatment - either D-Cycloserine placebo pill ( placebo pill contain active medication . ) At end 12 week , evaluate improvement compare patient start study use clinical neuroimaging ( fMRI ) test . Finally , want know whether patient PTLS over-active central pain circuit brain . Because pain process brain 's pain circuit , wish examine whether people suffer PTLS hyper-active pain circuit make sensitive pain normally-active pain circuit . To , compare patient PTLS healthy volunteer conduct careful neurologic brain imaging ( fMRI ) study . We hope study provide valuable information brain process pain signal PTLS whether treatment approach effective .</detailed_description>
