	<brief_summary>Growing evidence provide many observational study establish strong link decrease sleep duration poor glucoregulation . Sleep deprivation poor sleep quality induce insulin resistance decrease glucose tolerance healthy individual . However , influence poor sleep quality glycemic control patient Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) unknown . Persistent sleep deprivation among patient T1DM report , sleep loss attribute part nocturnal hypoglycemia . Nocturnal iatrogenic hypoglycemia limitation current intensive insulin therapy . Although severe hypoglycemia associate adverse event seizures death , less severe nocturnal hypoglycemia link broad range adverse consequence , acutely long term . Hypoglycemia stimulate sympathetic nervous system stress response , lead stimulation hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA ) . This result counter regulatory hormone cascade , elicit excessive cortisol secretion , know cause sleep disturbance could impair glucose homeostasis hypoglycemic event . The hyperinsulinemia T1DM patient promote HPA hyperactivity well , also associate impaired sleep quality lead sleep fragmentation , decrease slow wave sleep shorten sleep duration . Sleep disturbance due nocturnal hypoglycemia exacerbate HPA axis dysfunction , adversely affect sleep-wake cycle . The goal study understand impact nocturnal hypoglycemia sleep .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study duration 4 week long , subject undergo 1 week run-in period follow 3 randomized week observational study . During 1 week run-in period , subject familiarize CGM data collection procedure . Following run-in week , subject randomize specific order observation week . The three observation week resistance training week , aerobic exercise week control week explicit exercise . During observation week , 4 intervention plan , two aerobic exercise resistance training week . See Schematic detail . During aerobic exercise week intervention visit , subject exercise ~45 minute treadmill resistance training week , subject perform strength training exercise 1-3 set per exercise weight lift 8-12 repetition ( ~60-80 % 1-repetition max ) . The duration resistance training period expect ~45min . Subjects continue perform daily activity week . During week , subject wear one subcutaneous DexcomTM G4 DexcomTM G4 Share continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) system , one activity monitor- ActiGraph wGT3X-BT ActiGraph GT9X , one insulin pump ( subject 's pump ) one Samsung Galaxy S4 phone load two applications- meal memory move . The CGM system provide sense glucose data every 5 minute . The CGM data blind patient prevent abrupt change behavior . The accuracy sense data obtain reference measurement capillary blood glucose . The activity monitor secure dominant wrist us accelerometer collect movement data high frequency ( 80Hz ) . The activity monitor measure motion ambient light , data would use determine various sleep quality measure . The subject 's insulin dosage information pump download data analysis purpose . The subject 's daily meal intake ( photographic log note diary ) daily movement pattern information download phone . During 4 exercise intervention visit , subject 's heart rate , accelerometry information torso oxygen consumption measure breath breath may collect data analysis purpose .</detailed_description>
