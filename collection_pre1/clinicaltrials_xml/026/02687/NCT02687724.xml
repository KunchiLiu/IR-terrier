	<brief_summary>GLM dose Optimisation Adequate Levels Achieve Response Colitis ( GOAL-ARC ) . A nationwide multi-centred randomise control trial ( RCT ) investigate use GLM dose adjustment ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . The primary objective ascertain dose adjustment GLM base GLM drug level FCP level result high response remission rate standard SmPC dosing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>UC chronic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) line large intestine become inflame . There official database give accurate figure think least 20,000 people live IBD Ireland . Males female affect equally patient diagnosed age , include baby child . The peak age incidence age 15 35 , second ( small ) peak 50 70 . GLM human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody produce murine hybridoma cell line recombinant DNA technology . It part immunosuppressants pharmacotherapeutic group TNF-α inhibitor . It license use several chronic inflammatory condition include UC , Psoriatic arthritis , axial spondylitis , rheumatoid arthritis . The design GOAL-ARC aim address impact dose escalation GLM immediately follow induction subsequent maintenance phase response suboptimal drug level persist inflammatory burden represent raised faecal calprotectin ( FCP ) . FCP show correlate closely endoscopic disease activity6 .</detailed_description>
