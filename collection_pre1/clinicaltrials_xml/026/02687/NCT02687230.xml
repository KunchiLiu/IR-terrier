	<detailed_description>This open label , nonrandomized , dose-escalation trial fix dose MVT-2163 varying antibody mass MVT-5873 . The study design identify optimal dose ( total antibody mass ) optimal timing , tumor image use PET scan . This trial include dose escalation expansion phase . During dose escalation portion study , determination optimal time perform PET image make . Following identification `` optimal '' dose timing , 10 additional subject image use best dose timing . In portion study subject screen visit , 28 day later , eligible study receive MVT-2163 . Each cohort 3-6 subject . Subjects cohort 1 administered MVT-2163 alone day 1 . Subjects cohorts 2 3 receive MVT-5873 day 1 , follow approximately 10 minute later MVT-2163 . Subjects return visit clinic day 2 , 4 , 7 additional imaging safety assessment . A follow-up visit occur day 28 . The study also evaluate tissue distribution pharmacokinetics MVT-2163 , base data , study estimate radiation dosimetry MVT-2163 . Safety assessment perform use ECGs , vital sign measurement , assessment performance status , clinical laboratory measurement .</detailed_description>
