	<brief_summary>The prevalence dysphagia may high 22 % individual 50 year age . There therapeutic option offer individual . One recent therapeutic option Expiratory Muscle Strength Training ( EMST ) , use successfully maintain increase expiratory force generating pressure , cough function , swallow number disease population . Recently , investigator note improvement oral transit time swallow individual Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) could potentially attribute improved base tongue function muscle activation . There one study demonstrate breathe training result increase prolonged submental ( chin ) muscle activation evidence surface electromyography . However , study investigate activation tongue muscle various swallow breathing exercise . A small needle electrode ( fine wire EMG ) standard care diagnose muscular disease determine amount muscle recruitment muscle throughout body . This aim research study examine effect breathe exercise swallow exercise tongue muscle activity healthy adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study measure tongue muscle activation use fine wire EMG place tongue muscle ( underneath chin ) swallow breathe exercise . A neurologist trained EMG perform procedure ensure best placement minimize discomfort participant . While needle place , participant complete series swallow task breathe exercise use small , handheld training device . All swallow breathing task view x-ray order see movement time tongue swallow muscle task . Participation study take one , one-hour visit Shands Dental Tower lab space procedure complete .</detailed_description>
