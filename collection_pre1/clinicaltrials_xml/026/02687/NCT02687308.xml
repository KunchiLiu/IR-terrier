	<detailed_description>Introduction The best way treat localized prostate cancer radical prostatectomy ( RP ) . This surgery perform since 1905 , introduce Young . Initial result disappoint due high rate bleed , incontinence , impotence surgical complication . It knowledge anatomical basis vascularization innervation male pelvis Patrick Walsh radical retropubic prostatectomy ( RRP ) development become first choice treatment initial stage prostate cancer . Large series literature result show excellent long-term cancer control , 80 % patient evidence disease ( biochemical clinical ) 10 year . Urinary incontinence rate RRP vary widely , regard absence urinary incontinence 18 month surgery uniform presenting continence rate 90 % . However continence rate short term much low . The definition recovery sexual function surgery ability keep satisfactory sexual intercourse without use oral drug . The key factor recovery erectile capacity power prior surgery patient 's age surgical technique employ . Academic series open RRP report recovery rate 70 % bilateral preservation nerve , 50 % unilateral preservation 18 month . Recent study show benefit minimally invasive approach , laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( LRP ) , recently , robot-assisted radical prostatectomy ( RARP ) , respect complication like intraoperative bleeding , still demonstrate conclusively advantages oncological control . However recovery erectile function urinary continence seem recover good earlier . It believe 200-250 case learn curve reach level rate complication positive surgical margin become stable similar open radical prostatectomy , high cost robotic technology still limited generalization approach many country . The exponential adoption minimally invasive robot-assisted radical prostatectomy ( RARP ) remarkable unprecedented . According unverified estimate Da Vinci surgical system manufacturer ( Intuitive Surgical , Sunnyvale , CA ) 80 % radical prostatectomy within US perform robotically 2010 . This dramatic shift radical prostatectomy practice pattern occur despite lack evidence high quality method , yet demonstrate oncology benefit , safety cost effectiveness compare open surgery . While majority study make compare radical prostatectomy : robot X laparoscopic X open , show slight advantage first two regard intraoperative complication , especially bleed , post operative complication speed recovery continence sexual potency . There significant bias study , surgical technique use procedure differs significantly minimally invasive open surgical technique . The evolution minimally invasive prostate surgery base entirely different anatomical benchmark describe Patrick Walsh open radical prostatectomy . While robotics laparoscopic technique dissect prostate , bladder neck neurovascular bundle , antegrade way , bladder neck apex . With careful bladder neck dissection preservation , incremental careful nerve-sparing procedure meticulous rectoprostatic dissection posterior layer Denonvilliers ' fascia , aim maximize preservation fiber locate within periprostatic tissue cover lateral anterior surface prostate , urethrovesical anastomosis perform monofilament running suture . The Walsh open radical retropubic prostatectomy ( RRP ) technique completely different several way , dissection make prostatic apex bladder neck , retrograde direction , posterior layer Denonvilliers ' fascia always include specimen , urethrovesical anastomosis usually perform multifilament interrupted suture , indicate major difference . This trial propose prospective randomize study perform radical prostatectomy due open surgery use technique minimally invasive surgery , antegrade , bladder neck apex , careful bladder neck dissection preservation , incremental careful nerve-sparing procedure urethrovesical anastomosis perform monofilament running suture , describe Pasadena consensus procedure assist robot . A pilot study perform test feasibility technique manage complete ten surgery stage without conversion standard radical prostatectomy technique Patrick Walsh . Patients method This technique perform incision ( open surgery ) compare anatomical radical prostatectomy technique describe Patrick Walsh perform surgeon . Two hundred forty patient select localized prostate cancer indication radical surgery , confirm biopsy stag protocol urology service HUPE UERJ Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . Patients randomize two arm , accord kind technique , three set accord three different main surgeon . Randomization perform software site `` www.randomizer.org/ '' November 17 , 2015 , follow : Arm 1 - open retrograde radical retropubic prostatectomy ( RRP ) .
