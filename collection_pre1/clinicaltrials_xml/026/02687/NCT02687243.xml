Children highly anxious often require medication surgical procedure take long recover . While many attempt make reduce PA child , exist intervention limited expense time intensive nature . Thus , current lack effective efficient method reduce anxiety child surgery prompt u develop propose test new intervention . The investigator develop novel , interactive tablet base Virtual Reality program , StoryTelling Medicine ( STM ) , help reduce anxiety child undergo elective surgery , associate negative effect . STM age appropriate , customizable program prepare child complex surgical procedure guide hospital setting . The investigator examine STM effective reduce PA adverse effect child undergo surgery .

	<detailed_description>Children PA suffer physically emotionally , develop fear physician healthcare provider . These child tend avoid future medical care lead increase suffer child family , well high rate morbidity health care cost . There paucity research evaluate effect AudioVisual intervention reduce perioperative anxiety child undergo surgery . To date , one examine physiological effect PA intervention design reduce . In past 2 year , investigator conduct 3 pilot study examine stability perioperative anxiety child ( n=90 ) parent , well feasibility recruitment test protocol , pilot test interactive tablet-based application . The investigator establish PA reliably validly measured child rate participant recruitment , data collection , website adherence follow-up protocol propose study feasible acceptable . The investigator progress conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) . This RCT first examine effect STM reduce PA perioperative outcome child undergo elective surgery . Therefore , investigator include behavioral ( i.e. , observer- self-rated ) biological measure stress ( i.e. , heart rate , salivary cortisol ) understand impact STM PA . Unlike exist intervention , customizable STM program provide simulated hospital environment educate , also increase child 's cop ability well prepare surgery . In addition reduce child 's PA , also play important role reduce parental anxiety prepare parent knowledge tool support child throughout surgical process.The investigator believe STM promise tool improve child 's health ease familial societal cost PA easy cost-effective way . Given many child hospital receive adequate preoperative preparation , STM potential provide proper perioperative care every child need .</detailed_description>
