	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether fusion technique pre-radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) cross-sectional imaging ( CT MR ) real-time ultrasonography would improve feasibility RFA patient liver tumor comparison ultrasonography guidance alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-procedure Planning Radiofrequency Ablation Using CT MR/US Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RFA one commonly use local therapy primary secondary liver tumor . For successful safe procedure , safe route electrode lesion visibility essential RFA , condition usually evaluate pre-RFA planning ultrasonography ( USG ) . However , RFA sometimes abort due limited sonic window various cause challenge identification small isoechoic tumor hepatocellular carcinoma among dysplastic nodule . Therefore , precise target assure safe route would clinical importance . In preliminary study , investigator attempt determine US CT/MR fusion technique would able improve RFA feasibility patient liver tumor comparison conventional US alone technique .</detailed_description>
