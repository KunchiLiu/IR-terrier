	<brief_title>Dose-finding , Pharmacokinetics , Safety , Tolerability Meropenem-Vaborbactam Pediatric Subjects With Serious Bacterial Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In current era increase resistance extend spectrum cephalosporin , carbapenem antimicrobial agent frequently antibiotics `` last defense '' resistant pathogens serious infection , include find complicate Urinary Tract Infections ( cUTI ) . The recent dissemination serine carbapenemases ( e.g . KPC ) Enterobacteriaceae many hospital worldwide pose considerable threat carbapenems member beta-lactam class antimicrobial agent . Rempex develop meropenem-vaborbactam administer fix combination IV infusion , treat serious Gram-negative infection , cUTIs , include infection cause bacteria resistant currently available carbapenems . This study open label , dose-finding , pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerability study single dose infusion meropenem-vaborbactam pediatric subject birth less 18 year age serious bacterial infection</detailed_description>
