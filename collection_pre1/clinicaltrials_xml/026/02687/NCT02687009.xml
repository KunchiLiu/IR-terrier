	<brief_title>A Study Niclosamide Patients With Resectable Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Niclosamide drug traditionally use parasitic infection recently show regulated Wnt signal pathway cell level Frizzled receptor . The Wnt pathway critical embryogenesis , differentiation progenitor cell , support proliferation neoplastic tissue . In cancer , activation Wnt pathway lead increased transcription gene important growth , proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis , genetic stability , migration , angiogenesis . The Wnt pathway particular importance colorectal cancer . The purpose study obtain safety data along pharmacokinetic data information change WNT pathway signal follow niclosamide administration human . This phase I study support future study patient advance cancer cancer dysregulation Wnt pathway .</detailed_description>

Patients rectal cancer receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy also eligible . Karnofsky performance status great equal 70 % Age ≥ 18 year . Adequate hematologic function , ANC &gt; 1500/microliter , hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( may transfuse use erythropoietin achieve level ) , platelets ≥ 100,000/microliter ; INR &lt; 1.5 , PTT &lt; 1.5X ULN Adequate renal hepatic function , serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL , bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ( except Gilbert 's syndrome allow bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ) , ALT AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal . Ability understand provide sign informed consent fulfills Institutional Review Board 's guideline . Ability return Duke University Medical Center adequate followup , require protocol . Patients concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation therapy exclude Known active brain leptomeningeal metastasis ( define symptomatic metastasis ) continue requirement glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastasis . Treated , asymptomatic metastasis permit provided patient steroid least 1 month prior day 1 study drug . Patients serious intercurrent chronic acute illness , cardiac disease ( NYHA class III IV ) , hepatic disease , illness consider Principal Investigator unwarranted high risk investigational drug treatment . Patients medical psychological impediment probable compliance protocol exclude . Concurrent ( within last 5 year ) second malignancy non melanoma skin cancer , cervical carcinoma situ , control superficial bladder cancer , carcinoma situ treat . Presence know active acute chronic infection include : urinary tract infection , HIV viral hepatitis . Patients prior use niclosamide allergy niclosamide exclude protocol . Concomitant use strong CYP3A4 , CYP 1A2 , CYP2C9 substrates ( See http : //medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/maintable ) . Pregnant nursing woman exclude protocol since research may unknown harmful effect unborn child young child . If patient sexually active , patient must agree use medically acceptable form birth control receive treatment period 12 month follow last dose niclosamide . It know whether treatment use study could affect sperm could potentially harm child may father study . Patients complete bowel obstruction high risk GI perforation severe hemorrhage . Patients inflammatory bowel disease .</criteria>
