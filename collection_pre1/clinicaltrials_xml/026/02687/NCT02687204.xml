	<brief_summary>Blood clot form extremity ( deep venous thrombosis ) lung ( pulmonary embolus ) fear complication reconstructive surgery . One ten patient symptomatic pulmonary embolus dead 60 minute . Patients deep venous thrombosis develop post-thrombotic syndrome , know major driver poor quality life . These phenomenon , broadly know venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , substantial downstream ramification , US Surgeon General American Society Plastic Surgeons ( ASPS ) , among others , underscored importance VTE prevention surgical patient . Reconstructive surgery , commonly perform fix traumatic injury defect cancer excision , often involve borrow tissue adjacent distant area body ; reconstructive surgery patient routinely surgical injury involve 20 % total body surface area . Injury resultant inflammation know increase metabolism certain drug , include use prevent VTE surgery . Enoxaparin blood-thinning medication decrease likelihood blood clot formation . Previous research show reconstructive surgery patient give enoxaparin surgery less likely develop VTE . However , despite receive standard dose enoxaparin , many patient still develop life-threatening complication . The investigator believe patient metabolize enoxaparin differently base degree surgical injury create reconstruction , seek critically examine enoxaparin metabolism reconstructive surgery patient . The propose research evaluate enoxaparin affect blood base standard , ASPS-recommended dose reconstructive surgery ; investigator also examine whether extent surgical injury alters metabolism well . Enoxaparin effectiveness track use anti-Factor Xa ( aFXa ) level . If subtherapeutic aFXa level observe , study also design , implement test clinical enoxaparin dose-adjustment protocol achieve appropriate post-operative aFXa level . Further research base data examine reduction VTE risk aFXa-driven enoxaparin dosing use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ultimate goal investigator research well understand interplay enoxaparin dosing , degree surgical injury , blood clot major reconstructive surgery . Ultimately , research expand medicine 's understanding post-operative VTE occurs , allow investigator individualize patient 's VTE prophylaxis strategy base unique characteristic , improve patient safety reconstructive surgery .</detailed_description>
