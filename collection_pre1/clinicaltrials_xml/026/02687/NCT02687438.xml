	<detailed_description>The PROPEL mometasone furoate-releasing implant ( Intersect ENT , Menlo Park , CA ) first FDA-approved device reduce need post-operative intervention maintain patency deliver steroid medication directly ethmoid cavity follow surgery . Five recently publish clinical trial demonstrate mometasone furoate-releasing implant place hospital operating room office set produce statistically significant reduction inflammation , polyp formation , postoperative adhesion . In addition , implant find significantly reduce need postoperative prescription oral steroid decrease frequency postoperative lysis adhesion . Minimal adverse effect report trial .</detailed_description>
