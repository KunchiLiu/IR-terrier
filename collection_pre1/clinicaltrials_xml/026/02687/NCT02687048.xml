	<brief_summary>Falls significant consequence old adult , include fracture , disability , death ( 1 ) . Risk factor fall include impaired physical cognitive function ( 1 ) . Thus , old adult chronic stroke significant risk fall ( 2 ) . Exercise evidence-based approach reduce fall risk , even among live stroke-related impairment ( 3,4 ) . More recently , mindfulness base meditation gain recognition positive impact physical cognitive health ( 6,7 ) . Thus , investigator hypothesize combine exercise mindful meditation may great impact fall risk reduction compare exercise alone . To begin explore hypothesis , conduct 12-week proof-of-concept study among 20 old adult chronic stroke ( i.e. , suffer first clinical stroke &gt; = 12 month prior study entry ) . Participants randomly allocate either : 1 ) exercise ; 2 ) exercise + mindfulness base meditation . Outcomes include measure mobility , balance , cognitive function . 1 . Rubenstein , L..

	<detailed_description>Purpose : The intent study investigate whether , stroke survivor , combination Otago exercise program ( OEP ) mindfulness base meditation ( MBM ) may efficacious OEP alone respect balance , mobility , executive function . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize exercise home program combine MBM efficacious exercise alone improve balance , mobility , executive function stroke survivor . Justification Study : Each year , 40 000 Canadians experience stroke approximately 40 % stroke survivor leave moderate severe impairment ( 1 ) . Balance problem common stroke survivor implicate diminished function activity daily live ( ADLs ) mobility associate increase risk fall ( 2 ) . Stroke survivor show great postural sway alter weight distribution pattern , especially move weight direction affect low extremity ( 3 ) . These pattern see static dynamic balance level function ( 2 , 3 ) . Falls commonly see stroke even less serious fall may lead stroke survivor develop fear fall limit activity ( 4 ) . Executive function also commonly negatively affected stroke . Executive function refer high-level cognitive process include initiation , planning , sequence , monitoring , solve novel problem , modify behaviour light new information , perform two task concurrently , generate strategy , inhibition work memory ( 5 , 6 ) . Between 19-75 % stroke survivor show impaired executive function skill ( 6 , 7 ) . Persistent deficit executive function stroke survivor negatively impact recovery elevate risk functional dependence , failure return work , poor social participation ( 6 ) . The investigator plan conduct 12-week proof-of-concept study examine whether mindfulness base meditation ( MBM ) combine home-based exercise program efficacious exercise alone improve mobility , balance executive function outcomes stroke survivor . Should result find MBM enhance outcome CVA survivor , MBM could consider broadly application within physical therapy . It low cost low risk intervention option . All participant study benefit receive instruction home exercise routine . Half participant benefit learn MBM . The Otago exercise program ( OEP ) evidence-based falls prevention home-based program . The original OEP randomize control trial ( 4 total ) reduce fall among OEP community dwell adult age 65 96 year 35 % ( 8,9,10 ) . The OEP consist muscle strengthen balance exercise ( do 3x/week ) walking plan ( do 2x/week ) ( 9 ) . The OEP find improve fall executive function old adult risk fall ( 11 ) . Recent research suggest mindfulness base meditation ( MBM ) positively impact cognitive function include attention , memory executive function ( 12 ) . MBM process `` training mind function nonjudgmental minute minute mode '' ( 13 ) . MBM aim reorient individual present broaden self awareness ( 14 ) . MBM many form include Mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) , Mantra-based meditation Buddhist-based mindfulness practice ( 12 ) . All form MBM promote attention internal experience bodily sensation , thought , emotion , sight sound ( 15 ) . There emerge evidence MBM may increase hippocampal volume functional brain connectivity well promote cognitive function ( 16 , 17 ) . Previous study involve variety meditation technique report preliminary positive effect attention , memory , executive function , process speed cognition ( 12 ) . The majority study small contain control group ( 14 ) . Randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) meditation technique report low dropout rate high compliance rate ( 12 ) . Three RCTs outcome measure executive function demonstrate significant improvement ( 18,19,20 ) study able demonstrate significant finding ( 12 ) . A systematic review benefit mindfulness-based intervention follow transient ischemic attack stroke include four study result demonstrate positive trend favor benefit across range outcome include anxiety , depression , mental fatigue , blood pressure , perceive health quality life ( 21 ) . An unexpected finding PhD thesis investigate Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) improvement mobility upper extremity outcome measure ( 22 ) . There need RCTs investigate potential benefit meditation technique propose study novel term combine potential exercise program meditation stroke survivor . Should research project reveal MBM combination OEP improve outcome respect balance , mobility executive function , physiotherapists medical clinician may wish prescribe therapeutic combination optimize effectiveness balance retrain stroke survivor . Objectives 1 . To assess whether participant participate 12 week OEP MBM show significant improvement follow measure : 1 . Timed Go dual task Timed Go 2 . Short Physical Performance battery ( SPPB ) test balance 3 . 4 metre walk test mobility 4 . Stroop colour word test response inhibition 5 . Trail make test set shift 6 . Digit symbol substitution test cognition 2 . To explore whether mindful attention impact either intervention measure Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ( 23 ) . Research Method : Twenty community-dwelling stroke survivor participant express interest future study recruit mail . Individuals unable walk 6 metre independently , unable follow simple instruction , chronic medical condition would limit exercise participant concurrent condition dementia exclude study . Individuals also exclude unable read speak English aphasic . Participants randomize either : 1 ) OEP ( EX protocol ) ; 2 ) OEP + MBM ( EX Plus protocol ) . For EX protocol , participant receive revise version Otago individualize home-based exercise program ; trained physiotherapist make 5 home visit throughout 12-week intervention . The participant expect complete home exercise prescribe three time per week . Participants select EX Plus group receive MBM coach via 6 one-hour small group session experience meditation instructor . These participant expect practice home follow online audio recording write instruction minimum five time per week . Outcome measure physiological fall risk , mobility , cognitive function mindfulness assess baseline 12 week . Statistical Analysis : Baseline measure group conduct use independent sample T-test . Between-group difference 12 week compare multiple linear regression analysis . Experimental group baseline score include covariates ; alpha set &lt; 0.05 . For group comparison , percentage change score assign variable significantly different baseline .</detailed_description>
