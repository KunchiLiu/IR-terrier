	<brief_summary>The purpose trial determine efficacy safety combine therapy use thermotherapy ( TT ) ( one session , 50 degree Celsius 30 '' ) + miltefosine standard dose 2.5 mg/kg/day 21 day treatment uncomplicated CL Peru Colombia</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use topical treatment Cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) option widely explore currently list option WHO situations patient lesion ( ≤ 4 ) less ≤ 4 cm diameter locate area body may treat topically . Local heat , especially one produce radio frequency wave ( Themo-Med® ) widely test CL Old New World . The advantage use thermotherapy include : 1 ) high security profile ; 2 ) one session require ensure compliance treatment ; 3 ) easy use field since machine operate battery ; 4 ) effectiveness depend specie Leishmania cause lesion physical measure ; 5 ) use patient systemic treatment antimonials contraindicate , include woman pregnant breastfeeding . In New World , Thermo-Med® evaluate Mexico , Guatemala , Colombia Brazil ( one randomize clinical trial ) , report cure rate 90 % , 73 % , 64 % 75 % respectively There clinical trial evaluate efficacy miltefosine CL give less 20 day . The 21-day course choose give best chance combination approach base ) result Phase II trial conduct Colombia show mean dose miltefosine 133 mg/day/20 day result cure rate 82 % 20 ; b ) report show daily administration 100 mg/day ( 2.5 mg/kg body weight/day 28 day ) result mean maximum concentration drug serum day 23 treatment 70,000 ng/ml21 . The theoretical advantage offer combination ) use two approach currently recommend use individually good information regard efficacy safety use alone ; b ) use topical plus systemic treatment would hypothetically additive effect , since systemic treatment would eliminate circulate remain parasite locate periphery lesion topical treatment fails remove might cause relapses22,23 ; c ) offer opportunity increase current cure rate report treatment approach available used alone ; ) reduce length treatment miltefosine hopefully cost rate adverse event associate 28 day treatment miltefosine .</detailed_description>
