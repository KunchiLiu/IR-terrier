	<brief_title>A Study Intravenous EEDVsMit Children With Recurrent / Refractory Solid CNS Tumours Expressing EGFR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subject enrol study receive EEDVSMit IV injection twice weekly 20 min infusion begin study day 1 first cycle ( 4 week ) weekly subsequent cycle . Subjects undergo radiological assessment tumour first cycle , every second cycle thereafter . Dosing EEDVSmit continue unless radiographic evidence progressive disease ( PD ) per RECIST criterion version 1.1 , subject becomes intolerant study medication , sign symptoms clinical progression evident determine principal investigator , subject/parent/guardian withdraws consent . Suspected tumour progression confirm repeat scan 4 week exclude possibility pseudoprogression . Determination EGFR expression eligibility subject assess local site . In addition , radiological assessment confirm measurable disease RECIST criterion also require entry Part B study . The study conduct two part : Part A -Dose Exploration Part B -Dose Expansion . Part A - Dose Exploration : The dose exploration part study aim determine recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) patient group . A standard dose escalation roll 6 design use . Part A commence dose one log scale maximum dose test recent adult recurrent glioma trial ( first 4 dos administer 1/10 start dose ) escalate maximum 8x109 EEDVSMit evaluate safety tolerability , EEDVSMit . The first 4 dos administer reduced log reduction . Part B - Dose expansion : The dose expansion phase ( Part B ) begin upon completion dose exploration ( Part A ) . Up 12 subject recurrent/refractory solid CNS tumour treat Recommended Phase Two Dose ( RPTD ) . All dos , include first 4 , dose level establish Part A ( RPTD ) .</detailed_description>
