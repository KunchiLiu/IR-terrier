Spectacle correction ( applicable ) measurement enrollment visual acuity must meet follow criterion base cycloplegic refraction within 6 month : Requirements spectacle correction : For patient meet criterion strabismus i. Hypermetropia correct must undercorrected +1.50 D spherical equivalent , reduction plus sphere must symmetric two eye . Otherwise , spectacle correction investigator discretion . For patient meet criterion anisometropia combinedmechanism i. Spherical equivalent must within 0.50 D fully correct anisometropia ii . Hypermetropia must undercorrected +1.50 D spherical equivalent , reduction plus must symmetric two eye iii . Cylinder power eye must within 0.50 D fully correct astigmatism iv .
