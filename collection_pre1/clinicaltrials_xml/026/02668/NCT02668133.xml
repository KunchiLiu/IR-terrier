	<brief_summary>Background : Community based-intervention trial conduct among infant young child low- middle-income country find zinc supplementation young child ( form liquid supplement dispersible tablet ) increase linear growth weight gain , reduce prevalence diarrhea respiratory infection , lower all-cause mortality . Aside supplement , additional dietary zinc also provide `` home-fortification '' complementary food small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement ( SQ-LNS ; 20g/d ) , typically formulate peanut-based paste enrich vitamin mineral complex contain 8 mg elemental zinc ( ZnSO4 ) . However , efficacy LNS delivery vehicle preventive zinc supplementation remain uncertain . Two recent study , provide LNS contain 4-10 mg Zn daily 6-9 month find significant difference plasma zinc concentration end intervention period compare placebo . This lack response may due reduce absorption zinc part complex food matrix provide cereal-based meal ; SQ-LNS cereal grain contain moderate high concentration phytate , main dietary factor know substantially reduce zinc absorption . The addition exogenous phytases efficacious strategy reduce phytate content food , increase bioavailability dietary zinc ; however , efficacy approach yet demonstrate SQ-LNS . Objective : The overall objective study ass efficacy add exogenous phytase SQ-LNS investigate intra-individual difference fractional absorption zinc ( FAZ ) among child receive additional dietary zinc ( 8 mg/d ) SQ-LNS without phytase . Trial approach : The study double-blind randomize controlled clinical trial , design permit within-child comparison zinc absorption SQ-LNS , without exogenous phytase , use triple stable-isotope ratio tracer technique . The clinical study enroll 34 child age 18-23 month . The main outcome interest intra-individual difference FAZ porridge-based meal contain SQ-LNS without phytase . An additional 16 child enrol pilot feeding study determine portion size study meal . Trial setting : Keneba , The Gambia Trial intervention : The SQ-LNS ( 20g ) use study provide Nutriset , S.A.S . The exogenous phytase ( DSM phytase Tolerase 20000G ) derive Aspergillus niger ; phytase add SQ-LNS production phase , enzymatically active vivo time consumption . Feeding Protocol Study Diet : The study diet 2day absorption study consist follow : 1 ) Two stable-isotope label test meal per day ( porridge make locally procured non-fermented cereal , mixed 10 g SQ-LNS ) , child randomize receive either SQ-LNS phytase SQ-LNS without phytase first day alternative product second ; 2 ) One additional standardize meal per day ( e.g . rice sauce ) ; 3 ) Low-zinc , low-phytate food ( e.g . banana ) breast milk , consume ad libitum request ( exception 1 hour 2 hour test meal ) . Children feed caregiver supervision study fieldworker . The SQ-LNS product ( without phytase ) provide child twice per day one day prior start stable isotope absorption study , order habituate child study diet location . Children attend study clinic daily four day enrol study total ten day . Zinc absorption study : The FAZ zinc measure triple-isotope tracer ratio technique , use orally administer extrinsic label ( Zn-67 Zn-70 ) intravenous Zn-68 . Urine sample , collect pre- post-isotope administration ( 1 , 5-9 ) analyze zinc isotope ratio ICP-MS. FAZ calculate base mean isotopic ratio obtain enriched urine sample , base tracer : tracee ratio method . TAZ calculate multiply FAZ total zinc intake test meal . Data Collection : The follow information collect subject : brief medical history ; physical examination ; weight height ; daily morbidity pre-intervention blood sample hemoglobin , complete blood count plasma zinc concentration , malaria systemic inflammation ( C-reactive protein Î±-1-acid glycoprotein ) .</brief_summary>
