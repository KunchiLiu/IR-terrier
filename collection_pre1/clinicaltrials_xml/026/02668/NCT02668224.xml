	<brief_summary>It randomize , control clinical trial , healthy volunteer . They two group : test one perform vibration training ( 1h Vibrasens 3 time week , 24 session ) whereas control group training . The primary outcome maximal voluntary strength .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Effects Tendon Vibrations Neuromechanical Muscular Properties .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>These last 10 year , new idea bear : vibration could potential effect muscular recondition . Researchers previously demonstrate effect plantar ankle flexion , increase strength , healthy volunteer . Nowadays physician would like demonstrate effect another muscular group : ankle 's dorsal flexor . 24 session program 8 week . Moreover , last result show modification nervous capacity cortical voluntary activation . Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) great tool explore neuromuscular function , cortical stage . The use tool allow characterization effect vibration train cortical activation state .</detailed_description>
