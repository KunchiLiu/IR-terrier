	<brief_summary>The implantable-cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) small medical device use treat dangerously fast potentially life-threatening heart rate . For patient risk , ICD detect abnormal rhythm provide life-saving therapy deliver shock . ICD therapy risk benefit weigh patient 's perspective . An ICD battery need surgically replace 4 7 year ensure ongoing function . At present , majority battery automatically change without elicit patient ' preference . There need good way engage patient . Patients want involve healthcare decision , yet half patient ICD know ICD replacement optional . To ensure patient receive treatment value want , member interprofessional team ensure treatment decision align patient ' expectation , value preference . This rest principle share decision make member healthcare team patient deliberate together arrive decision best reflect preference value patient . To facilitate achievement goal , patient decision aid ( PDA ) use . As result , investigator develop PDA ICD replacement . The purpose feasibility trial collect preliminary data test feasibility conduct large trial , evaluate PDA acceptability ease use . Eligible consented participant face ICD replacement randomize receive decision aid usual care . The investigator assess decision aid improve participant ' knowledge ICD therapy replacement surgery , increase patient ' perceive involvement decision , determine whether actual choice reflect personal value .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decision Support Adults Facing Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Pulse Generator Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) due ventricular arrhythmia serious cause cardiovascular death Canada . The implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) reduce incidence SCD high-risk patient deliver internal shock restore normal rhythm . The life expectancy ICD generator estimate four seven year , must surgically replace ensure ongoing function . Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD ) replacement become increasingly common constitute nearly 40 % ICD procedure . For part , ICDs automatically replace . With every ICD replacement , net benefit continue ICD therapy assess individually view procedural risk , inappropriate shock , psychological risk , change health status , potential harm suffer end-of-life . Some study show mortality benefit ICD attenuate advance age comorbidities . There many legitimate reason decline ICD generator replacement . The chronic nature cardiac condition and/or diagnosis life-limiting disease since initial implantation may compel patient reconsider health care goal support quantity life , prioritize one quality . This important distinction ICD prolong die process deliver shock ( ) result pain discomfort patient , helplessness witness . Other patient report psychological distress , others report truly understanding effect live ICD receive one , possibly lead change treatment preference face decision replace . Also , replacement procedure include substantially great risk infection reoperation compare initial implantation . These complexity warrant decision support prepare patient make decision . Yet , mean exists support patient ' decision-making context ICD replacement . A decision support intervention ( include patient decision aid decision coaching ) develop use user-centered design various stakeholder potential end-users , could moderate treatment related uncertainty prepare patient make high quality decision inform base personal preference value . Objectives : 1 . Conduct pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) determine feasibility conduct large trial . 2 . To determine effect decision support intervention adult face ICD replacement attribute decision quality decision-making process</detailed_description>
