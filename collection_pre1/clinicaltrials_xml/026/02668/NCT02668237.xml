	<detailed_description>Community-Acquired Pneumonia ( CAP ) child recurrent pathology multiple severity score . Almost two three case identify emergency treat ambulatory patient present reassure clinical state . The etiology never really identify , initial treatment always base probabilistic antibiotic re-evaluated H48 , case bacterial infection , way , potentially severe . This old conception oppose new discovery , particularly pediatric unit strictly viral pneumonia important predict ( least 30 50 % ) lead hyper prescription antibiotic , useless . Molecular test ( `` multiplex '' ) allow simultaneous detection huge number pathogenic agent , virus bacteria , available . Aware non specificity clinical data guide diagnostic , project base new strategy diagnostic , use multiplex PCR quick result ( less 2 hour , 20 pathogen , include 17 virus ) couple antigenic urinary test allow complete , quick , etiologic diagnostic soon child support emergency . Children randomize two group inclusion : quick diagnostic strategy versus usual practice . Analyse centralize anti-infectious treatment optimization ( antibiotics antiviruses ) , aim well treat patient , minimize cost , decrease selection pressure multi-resistant bacteria .</detailed_description>
