	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) potential complication cardiac surgery . In animal model , excess exogenous Cl- ion bloodstream associate AKI . Normal saline IV fluid high level Cl- ion blood usually carry . An alternative IV fluid sell name Isolyte low Cl- ion level . There literature compare AKI outcome cardiac patient patient receive normal saline vs. Isolyte . The investigator propose recruit randomize 30 trial-completing cardiac surgery patient ( 40 enrol ) 2 study arm compare renal outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) potential complication patient undergoing cardiac surgery . AKI post-cardiac surgery patient associated adverse outcome , prolong intensive care hospital stay , diminish quality life , increase long-term mortality , increase risk chronic kidney disease require dialysis . The mortality cardiac surgery patient AKI severe enough require renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) high 60 % . One putative agent associate AKI animal model receive crystalloid fluid resuscitative intervention excess exogenous chloride ion ( Cl- ) . As compare non-Cl- contain solution animal model , excess Cl- appear lead hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis , increase renal vascular resistance , reduce renal blood flow , reduce glomerular filtration rate - injurious kidney function . Historically , one common balance salt-solutions use adult cardiac surgery 0.9 % normal saline ( NS ) , crystalloid solution 154 mmol/L Cl- . This much high physiologic plasma level 103 mmol/L . Isolyte , less commonly use crystalloid solution , much closer physiologic level 98 mmol/L Cl- . In context cardiac surgery , literature expressly compare effect balance crystalloid solution Isolyte versus NS AKI incidence . There single trial examine low-Cl- containing colloid solution cardiac surgery find less metabolic acidosis ; however , AKI marker AKI measure outcomes lone trial , know whether low Cl- solution effect AKI risk human . AKI result series extremely complex cellular molecular pathway involve endothelial , epithelial , inflammatory , interstitial cell . The gold standard identification classification AKI dependent serial serum creatinine ( Scr ) measurement , measurement unreliable acute change kidney function . Recent study show tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase ( TIMP-2 ) perform well exist marker predict development moderate severe AKI ( Kidney Disease : Improving Global Outcomes [ KDIGO ] stage 2 3 ) within 12 hour sample collection . To enhance sensitivity utilize TIMP-2 , investigator plan also measure urinary insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 ( IGFBP7 ) . Along TIMP-2 , IGFBP7 also inducer G1 cell cycle arrest , key mechanism implicate AKI . This study utilize urinary [ TIMP-2 ] * [ IGFBP7 ] multiplicative product composite biomarker index investigate impact intraoperative infusion NS versus Isolyte post-cardiac surgery renal function . This biomarker identify patient risk imminent ( within 12 hour ) AKI KDIGO criterion . Patients present cardiac surgery already quite ill often multiple comorbidities . Acute kidney injury population associate significant morbidity mortality . The available literature indicate fairly simple intervention could plausibly reduce incidence AKI , yet examine human . Generating evidence basis substantially improve safety patient need cardiac surgery . This intervention reduce AKI may also apply broad non-cardiac surgery population well .</detailed_description>
