	<brief_title>Ipilimumab ( Immunotherapy ) MGN1703 ( TLR Agonist ) Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level MGN1703 base join study . Up 4 dose level MGN1703 test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level MGN1703 . Each new group receive high dose MGN1703 group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose MGN1703 find . This call dose escalation . In another part study ( call dose expansion ) 3 group 12 additional participant enrol . Two ( 2 ) group receive MGN1703 high tolerable dose find dose escalation . One ( 1 ) group receive first dose level MGN1703 ( find tolerable ) . The study doctor tell dose MGN1703 receive . All participant receive dose level ipilimumab . You receive ipilimumab standard dos . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 21 day . You give MGN1703 injection skin Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle . Each administration 1-4 injection multiple part body ( upper arm thigh , abdomen thighs , abdomen upper arm ) . The study doctor tell many time inject . If dose expansion , may receive MGN1703 injection directly tumor . The study doctor tell receive study drug way . You also receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute Day 8 Cycles 1-4 . Study Visits : During Week 1 every cycle , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . During Week 2 Cycles 1-4 , physical exam . During Week 3 Cycles 1 3 , blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw routine test biomarker test . During Week 3 Cycles 2 4 : - Blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw routine test biomarker test . - Urine collect routine test . - You EKG . - You image scan check status disease . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pregnancy test . If melanoma dose expansion , Day 1 Cycle 3 biopsy biomarker test ( include genetic biomarkers ) . During Cycle 4 every even-numbered cycle ( Cycles 6 , 8 , 10 , ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw routine test biomarker test . - You image scan check status disease . After 1 year study , scan every 4 cycle . During Cycle 4 every 4 cycle ( Cycles 8 , 12 , 16 , ) : - Urine collect routine test . - You EKG . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pregnancy test . Every 30 day 90 day last dose study drug , call member study staff ask new anticancer drug may start feel . You may also ask question routine clinic visit information may collect medical record . If call , call last 10-15 minute . Length Study : You may receive MGN1703 combination ipilimumab 4 cycle . After , may continue take MGN1703 alone long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You participation study 90 day last dose study drug . This investigational study . MGN1703 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Ipilimumab FDA approve commercially available treatment unresectable ( remove surgery ) metastatic ( spread ) melanoma . Up 60 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
