	<detailed_description>Chronic widespread pain ( CWP ) , cardinal feature fibromyalgia , associate lose work productivity , psychological ill health , poor quality life . It one common reason referral rheumatologist . The cost CWP high term individual , societal health cost : example , United States , mean per-patient cost ( include pain non-pain-related medication , physician consultation , test procedure , emergency department visit ) 6 month follow new diagnosis fibromyalgia report $ 3481 , comparable patient rheumatoid arthritis result bad quality life . Current guideline recommend pharmacological , physical , psychological therapy although importance attribute individual therapy inconsistent . There good evidence musculoskeletal pain condition generally long duration symptom , less likely symptom improve , include specific intervention . This particularly CWP , develop , challenge manage effect improvement . A systematic review meta-analysis randomise control trial ( RCT ) Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ( CBT ) patient fibromyalgia conclude CBT improve cop pain , reduces depress mood healthcare-seeking behaviour patient . The delivery CBT telephone show effective , acceptable accessible . The MUSICIAN study , investigator recently conclude , test telephone deliver CBT ( tCBT ) and/or exercise patient chronic widespread pain consulting GP . Three month end therapy , intervention result significantly well primary outcome measure ( patient global health ) treatment usual , significant additional benefit receiving intervention . Recent analysis demonstrate benefit maintain 2 year end therapy . The investigator conduct comprehensive literature review aim identify randomise trial aim prevent onset either CWP fibromyalgia . This review identify publish trial . Further , search 11 international clinical trial registers/databases ( include US , UK , Europe , Australia/New Zealand , Japan ) , undertaken Autumn 2013 identify ongoing trial aim prevent onset CWP ( fibromyalgia ) . There several reason may desirable try prevent CWP onset , namely majority CWP patient important symptom improvement current management ( even within trial ) . Prediction model epidemiological study develop identify `` high risk '' patient , make approach feasible . Research use General Practice Research Database demonstrate prior receive diagnosis fibromyalgia primary care , person long-term prior history consultation symptom . Although first prevention trial area , concept prevention use CBT address musculoskeletal disorder respect intervention neck pain low back pain people become patient mental disorder . The investigator conduct prospective epidemiological study demonstrate possible identify `` high risk '' group . In first study , high risk group CWP onset identify basis two factor : somatic awareness ( use Somatic Symptom Scale ) illness behaviour ( use Illness Behaviour Score ) . This replicated second study conduct applicant . These `` aetiological model '' exclude pain therefore investigator re-analysed data latter study ( also consider pain status ) identify best predictor onset result model suitable use prevention study . The result `` risk model '' require regional pain two following : maladaptive behavioural response illness ) , high number somatic symptom , sleep disturbance . In second `` validation '' study , population 2,374 person without CWP , 653 satisfied definition `` high risk CWP '' 139 develop CWP twelve month later ( Positive Predictive value 21.3 % ) . Amongst person deem high risk ( n=1721 ) , 77 develop CWP Negative Predictive Value 95.5 % . The investigator previously show short long-term effectiveness tCBT CWP ( compare usual care ) . Specifically demonstrate sustained improvement patient global assessment change , reduce psychological distress , fear movement reliance passive coping style . Secondly investigator develop refined statistical model identify person high risk future development CWP . The investigator therefore propose study test whether tCBT reduce risk CWP onset amongst high risk . Three health board Scotland research sit study . The three health board NHS Grampian , NHS Highland , NHS Greater Glasgow Clyde . The study require involvement 7 8 equivalent general practice . The investigator mail randomly select sample adult age 25 year register participate general practice study area . The Scottish Primary Care Research Network ( SPCRN ) involve recruitment patient study primary care . SPCRN staff provide GP practice expert service undertake search electronic database identify random sample potentially eligible patient prepare ethically approve letter send . Searches undertaken GP practice screen survey questionnaires sent Health Informatics Centre Services Dundee behalf practice . Patients return complete survey questionnaires research team University Aberdeen response assess research team eligibility patient send invitation letter eligible . The `` screening questionnaire '' determine whether ) respondent meet study eligibility criterion b ) respondent would willing contacted regard treatment trial `` musculoskeletal health '' . The questionnaire include : - Pain assess specific question experience pain , consultation body manikin ( provide site also allow u exclude already chronic widespread pain ) . - Illness Behaviour Scale - Somatic Symptoms Scale ( exclude pain item ) - Sleep Problem Scale - Quality Life Wellbeing - General Health Questionnaire - Chalder Fatigue Scale A list eligible patient provide general practitioner advance , option indicate unsuitable study . Patients would send information study subsequently contact member research team telephone , appropriate , consent recruited trial . Included mail eligible patient information sheet , consent form , best-time-to-call slip . Once patient return signed consent form best-time-to-call slip , member research team phone . The researcher read script give information study , patient opportunity ask question study . If patient consent participate participant recruit study randomise one arm trial . Follow-up questionnaire mail participant 3 , 12 24 month treatment start date ( participant active treatment group ) dummy treatment start date ( usual care ) . Instruments include follow-up questionnaire screen survey questionnaire . Additionally , follow-up questionnaire include Patient Global Impression Change , question health care usage . Participants option withdraw treatment study time . Those withdraw treatment continue send follow-up questionnaire unless participant request receive . Failure participant complete follow-up questionnaire particular timepoint count withdrawal unless participant request receive follow-up . Our previous longitudinal study onset CWP ( subsequent replication ) suggest 21 % `` high risk '' person identify develop CWP course next twelve month . Our previous data base person pain least 2 3 `` risk factor '' . There publish study prevention CWP base measure effect . However MUSICIAN study subject , although report CWP screen survey , long CWP enrolment interview . These participant however still eligible take part , provide participant regional pain . Therefore subject regional pain provide sub-population base likely effect tCBT . Amongst subject , receive tCBT reduce odds CWP end study OR 0.5 95 % CI ( 0.2-1.4 ) compare usual care . Thus study power ability current study reduce onset CWP 21 % 12 % , 90 % power 5 % significance level . The investigator assume , base prior data , 75 % person allocate tCBT arm adherent intervention , 80 % subject return follow-up questionnaire assess outcome . Accordingly investigator require 473 subject per arm total 946 subject recruit . In MUSICIAN exactly 50 % find eligible willing consider take part ultimately randomise . A previous trial cognitive-behavioural intervention prevent chronic pain find 36 % patient identify eligible end recruit study . If 80 % eligible patient agree contact take part , equate 45 % eligible willing consider take part randomise - high number clinical trial CWP reflect fact prevention trial rather treatment trial may less attractive potential participant . Thus investigator aim find total 2102 subject eligible willing consider take part . Assuming participation rate survey 30 % , 1 4 people `` risk '' , ( use data MUSICIAN ) 80 % people return questionnaire agree consider take part , investigator require survey 35 037 person . A pre-defined statistical analysis plan develop signed trial steer committee undertake data analysis . Comparison arm intention-to-treat basis ( main analysis ) per protocol sensitivity analysis . Characteristics study participant two treatment arm describe use simple summary statistic . Descriptive statistic include mean standard deviation normally distribute continuous data , median inter-quartile range skew continuous data count percentage categorical data . No formal statistical comparison make baseline characteristic . Primary secondary outcome describe three follow-up time : 3 , 12 24 month , use appropriate summary statistic .</detailed_description>
