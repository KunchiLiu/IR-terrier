	<brief_title>Comparing Effects EST EPBD Patients With Acute Biliary Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early endoscopic retrograde choledocho pancreatogram endoscopic sphincterotomy suggest patient acute biliary pancreatitis reduce complication mortality . Retrospective study investigator ' hospital show endoscopic papillary balloon dilation safe treatment acute biliary pancreatitis . However , report literature concern prospective study compare effect endoscopic sphincterotomy endoscopic papillary balloon dilation treatment acute biliary pancreatitis . Moreover , presence infective microorganism biliary and/or pancreatic duct may play important role onset outcome acute biliary pancreatitis . Blood bile obtain via endoscopic mean another way know causative bacterium/bacteria . However , still need considerable period time get result culture . Recently , next-generation sequencing technology develop , facilitate analysis large number microorganism different environment human body site . 16S ( svedberg unit ) ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid sequence analysis metagenomics two effective DNA sequencing approach , use study uncultivated gut microbial community . Aims : 1 . To study clinical effect endoscopic sphincterotomy endoscopic papillary balloon dilation acute biliary pancreatitis . 2 . To compare result obtained traditional bile/blood culture metagenomics . Methods : Beginning Jan 2016 , patient age ≥ 20 year acute biliary pancreatitis concomitant either sign acute cholangitis bile duct obstruction enrol study . Participants randomize either endoscopic sphincterotomy endoscopic papillary balloon dilation group . The treatment effect safety group compare . The primary endpoint relative successful rate retrieval common bile duct stone group . The secondary endpoint frequency use mechanical lithotripter , drainage procedure , complication mortality , well number treatment section . Besides blood culture exam , bile aspirate place single-use , 5-French , standard catheter ( guide-wire cannulation ) bile duct injection contrast agent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography . Approximately 10 mL bile collect transfer sterile tube . Half bile obtain transported microbiology laboratory blood culture bottle anaerobic transport system . Bacteria culture identify accord standard protocol use clinical microbiology laboratory . Another half bile specimen send metagenomic study . Finally , investigator try compare result obtain traditional bile culture /blood culture metagenomics , understand effect infective microorganism biliary and/or pancreatic duct acute biliary pancreatitis . In addition , investigator want find best mean early accurate diagnosis pathogen responsible infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age ≥ 20 year acute biliary pancreatitis concomitant either sign acute cholangitis bile duct obstruction enrol study . They randomize two treatment group ( sphincterotomy vs. balloon dilation ) . Patients diagnose acute gallstone pancreatitis fulfill two item c , plus one item , e : 1. abdominal pain typical pancreatitis ; 2. elevation serum amylase and/or lipase three time normal ; 3. imaging study ( abdominal ultrasound abdominal computed tomography ) show evidence pancreatitis 4. common bile duct stone , acute cholangitis ( Charcot 's triad ) , total bilirubin ( total bilirubin ) &gt; 4mg / dL , bile duct dilatation ( diameter &gt; 6mm intact gallbladder , &gt; 10mm gallbladder remove ) plus total bilirubin 1.8 ~ 4mg / dL ; 5. exclude cause acute pancreatitis . septic shock serious coagulopathy ( international normalize ratio 1.5 , partial thromboplastin time great twice control , platelet count &lt; 50 x 1000 / Cumm ) malignant tumor biliary pancreatic tract severe cardiovascular mental illness cooperate exam treatment ; pregnant woman patient ever receive surgery endoscopic treatment biliopancreatic tract</criteria>
