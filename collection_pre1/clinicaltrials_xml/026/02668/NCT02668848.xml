	<brief_summary>The investigator previously find blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ( BUN/Cr ) ratio &gt; 15 independent predictor early deterioration acute ischemic stroke . Another study conduct determine whether urine specific gravity , another indicator hydration status one easily obtain , also independent predictor early deterioration stroke-in-evolution ( SIE ) patient . The investigator also conduct preliminary study , enrol ischemic stroke patient BUN/Cr ratio &gt; 15 find daily Bun/Cr base hydration help decrease post stroke infection rate improve 3 month functional outcome . In study , daily urine specific gravity use adjust hydration therapy ischemic stroke patient initial Bun/Cr ratio &lt; 15 . The primary outcome post stroke infection rate first 7 day admission , secondary outcome 3 month functional outcome use mRS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke remain major medical issue . According American Heart Association ( AHA ) report 2012 , new recurrent stroke occur around 795,000 people year , 1 every 18 death United States due stroke . The incidence stroke may even high Chinese population US population . In Taiwan , average annual incidence rate first-ever stroke people 36 year 330 per 100,000 . The associated disease burden stroke increase annually remain significant health concern . Common medical complication stroke include infection , fall , pressure sore , depression . A systematic review show 30 % patient develop post-stroke infection . Though rate pneumonia urinary tract infection stroke 10 % , pneumonia associate high mortality . If stroke patient become infected admission , may experience neurologic deterioration , poor functional outcome , increase length stay ( LOS ) . Adequate hydration necessary maintenance physiologic homeostasis . Dehydration frequent cause mortality elderly patient . Dehydration common early feature acute ischemic stroke may contributor poor outcome . In absence know biological marker dehydration , biochemical data analyze identify marker . These study show blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) /creatinine ( Cr ) ratio ≥ 15 use marker dehydration . Our previous study also reveal BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 15 independent predictor stroke-in-evolution ( SIE ) . These study suggest BUN/Cr ratio may use identify patient acute ischemic stroke dehydrate benefit hydration therapy . The investigator conduct phase II single arm control trial patient acute ischemic stroke BUN/Cr ratio ≥15 conduct January 2011 December 2013 . The result demonstrate blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ( BUN/Cr ) -based hydration therapy decrease length stay ( LOS ) rate post-stroke infection . Since BUN/Cr ratio indicator hydration status , urine specific gravity also indicator hydration status , investigator hypothesize urine specific gravity would also independent predictor early deterioration . A urine specific gravity &gt; 1.010 indicates urine concentrate kidney mean body might relatively dehydrate . Because increase urine specific gravity occur early increase BUN/Cr ratio , investigator think increase urine specific gravity might earlier predictor early deterioration ischemic stroke BUN/Cr ratio . In study , daily urine specific gravity use adjust hydration therapy ischemic stroke patient initial Bun/Cr ratio &lt; 15 . The primary outcome post stroke infection rate first 7 day admission , secondary outcome 3 month functional outcome use mRS .</detailed_description>
