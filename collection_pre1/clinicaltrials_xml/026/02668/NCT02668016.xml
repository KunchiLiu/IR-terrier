	<brief_title>Self-Assessment Method Statin Side-effects Or Nocebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : 50 participant recruit trial . Method : At baseline participant detail interview study doctor ass past medical history previous symptom attribute statin assess eligible enrol . Eligible participant enrol InForm allocate participant random predefined order take study intervention . These random code generate trial unit statistician supply production pharmacy . The participant dispense High Density Polyethylene ( HDPE ) containers pre-specified order assign inform . Each participant receive 12 set HDPE container pre-labelled . 4 set HDPE container contain medication , 4 contain 1-month supply match placebo 4 contain 1-month supply atorvastatin 20mg . At start next calendar month screen visit participant commence trial intervention . The research nurse call participant remind start 1st day next month screen thereafter participant also receive monthly reminder phone switch next set HDPE container month . Each day participant rate daily symptom phone application also complete 3 additional questionnaire monthly basis . The study nurse call participant end month assess progress trial . Each participant return box dispense visit ( applicable ) study end order pill count undertaken assess medication adherence . The placebo atorvastatin pill visually identical . The study enroll participant intend re-start clinical use statin . Participants ' medication continue manage normal physician , restriction starting , stop change dos For safety reason participant 's physician ask consult investigator prior consideration starting , amend dose , lipid lower medication 3.4 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES For trial , participant receive smartphone preferred application download exist phone allow real-time daily documentation symptom experience visual analogue scale 0-100 . Participants receive train simple touch-screen interface leaflet information also provide . There optional daily reminder disable intrusive . Participants rate symptom every day , daily score aggregate monthly score . This preferable score month , participant may struggle remember aggregate symptom burden especially vary day . Each month participant fill two validated questionnaire impact side-effects quality life . These EuroQol ( EQ-5D-3L ) , well-validated measure health relate quality life , Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Medicine ( TSQM ) questionnaire , validate treatment satisfaction questionnaire . EQ-5D-3L ass five domain health overall self-rated health use visual analogue scale . EQ-5D-3L conventional assess efficacy medication quality life may sufficient assess side effect , therefore TSQM questionnaire also use . Use health relate quality life questionnaire treatment satisfaction questionnaire allow assessment participant ' multiple health state , overall self-rated health status treatment satisfaction , provide test convergent validity measurement invariance monthly aggregate symptom burden score . The investigator also ask participant fill short questionnaire detail potentially physician , restriction starting , stop change dos For safety reason participant 's physician ask consult investigator prior consideration starting , amend dose , lipid lower medication .</detailed_description>
