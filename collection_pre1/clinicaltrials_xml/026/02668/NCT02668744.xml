	<brief_summary>The investigator recently complete NIH R21 grant , randomize control trial ( RCT ) test effect gardening , nutrition , cook program 375 low-income Hispanic student live Los Angeles . Preliminary result study show intervention compare control student reduction BMI parameter waist circumference , increase daily intake dietary fiber vegetable , improve lipid profile . The investigator want expand replicate study : ) use cluster randomize school design ; b ) implement program school hour ; c ) increase sample size ; ) lengthen intervention period one school year ; e ) collect comprehensive metabolic measurement child ; f ) enhance family workshop ; g ) collect parental data ; h ) develop evaluate sustainability strategy . Thus , overall goal project test effect large school-based gardening , nutrition , cook RCT ( call `` Sprouts '' ) dietary intake , dietary-related behavior , obesity , relate metabolic disorder low-income Hispanic youth family Central Texas . Sixteen elementary school randomize either : 1 ) Sprouts intervention 2 ) Control ( delay intervention ) . At intervention school , investigator build edible garden ; form train Garden Leadership Coalitions ( GLCs ) ; teach 20 Sprouts in-school lesson student ; teach nine family-based Sprouts lesson throughout school year . The following measure obtain student baseline post-intervention : height , weight , BMI , waist circumference , body composition ( via bioimpedance ) , blood pressure , glucose , insulin , lipid ( via voluntary fast blood draw ) , dietary intake , relate psychosocial behavior ( e.g. , preference/motivation/self-efficacy eat FV ) . The investigator also measure anthropometrics , dietary intake , related dietary psychosocial variable parent baseline post-intervention . After intervention year , investigator provide series training workshops resource GLCs schoolteacher sustain Sprouts program subsequent year . The investigator measure sustainability employ school process logs/surveys , structure interview , school observation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A School-based Gardening Obesity Intervention Low-income Minority Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Garden Leadership Coalition ( GLC ) : The investigator establish GLCs school intervention phase , facilitate school-level component intervention . These GLCs comprise interested teacher , school staff , senior citizen , parent , child , group different unique school site . Edible Gardens : Raised bed use garden site , easy build , make garden access easy child developmental level , ensure soil free heavy metals/contaminants , reduce weed garden area . Each school site get material supply need garden upkeep teaching lesson , . Curriculum : A total 18 lesson ( 1 hour ) teach weekly course intervention year . The curriculum culturally tailor Hispanics , include culturally appropriate recipe , content , activity . The curriculum map State Texas Assessments Academic Readiness ( STAAR ) standard science , math , language art , health , social study . The 9 parent lesson ( 1 hour long ) parallel nutrition garden topics/activities teach child . The parent curriculum available English Spanish culturally adapt evaluate . The curriculum strong emphasis cooking component focus grow cook food culturally appropriate . School Lessons : The investigator hire bilingual nutrition garden educator experience teach nutrition/ gardening program teach Sprouts curriculum . Lessons teach educator separately 3rd-5th grade classroom throughout school year part normal school day . Although nutrition garden educator provide teach lesson first year , schoolteacher attend lesson , provide initial training continue program subsequent year . Family Lessons Schools : The bilingual garden/nutrition educator also teach monthly Sprouts lesson throughout school year family participants school . Delayed Intervention Control Schools : The control school receive delay intervention ( identical intervention describe ) year post-testing wave . Baseline post-intervention measurement occur control parent student within time period intervention school . Every control school receive garden , identical size structure intervention school . Evaluation Measures : Evaluation measure collect baseline end school year arm ( intervention control school ) . Measurements occur first four week school fall last four week school spring . Most measure child collect school normal school hour , whereas blood draw collected school campus school start . Parent questionnaire hand mail home consent obtain . The questionnaire translate Spanish , culturally appropriate , take ~60 minute complete . Anthropometrics , Body Fat , Blood Pressure : For child parent , weight measure use digital scale near 0.1 kg , height measure use wall-mounted stadiometer near 0.1 cm . BMI ( kg/m2 ) BMI percentiles Center Disease Control ( CDC ) age- gender-specific value use . Waist circumference ( WC ) measure record nearest 0.1 cm . Body composition assess use Bioelectrical Impedance Tanita Body Fat Analyzer . Blood pressure obtain duplicate automatic cuff accord recommendation American Heart Association . Parental height , weight , body fat , WC , blood pressure collect first last family workshop ( expect subsample ) . Therefore investigator ask self-reported height weight questionnaire packet . Dietary Intake : The questionnaire use School Physical Activity Nutrition Project diet intake question , design ass child 's intake food group , specific focus fruit fruit juice , vegetable , potato ( include exclude French fry ) , whole grain , meat/poultry/fish , dairy , legumes , saturate fat , `` add sugar '' ( sweeten cereal , soft drink , sweet ) . The investigator also collect 24-hour diet recall subset child . Trained interviewer collect three recall telephone . All recall data analyze use Nutrition Data System Research ( NDS-R 2012 , University Minnesota ) . Demographic Dietary Psychosocial Measures : Demographic information include age , socioeconomic status ethnicity obtain via questionnaire . Parents fill brief medical history form child rule exclusion criterion . Children parent complete questionnaire assess preference motivation fruit vegetable Intake , self-efficacy garden , cook , eat FV , food insecurity , home eating environment . All parent questionnaires available English Spanish , write 3rd grade read level . Fasting Blood Sample : Certified phlebotomist perform fast blood draw student first thing morning school start school baseline end school year . Students parental consent assent participate blood draw . Students assent participate blood draw still allow participate Sprouts program . Fasting blood drawn ass glucose , insulin , lipid , adipocytokines . Blood sample spun , aliquoted , frozen , transported University Texas ( UT ) campus assay . All child elevate glucose level ( abnormal Type 2 diabetes range ) elevate blood pressure contact via telephone Dr. Pont ( Co-I study ) explain test result refer immediately health clinic follow-up . However , child still allow participate study . Train Trainer Workshops : At begin sustainability year , educator lead three `` train trainer '' workshop . Schoolteachers give complete curriculum manual , electronic copy student curriculum , access teach material need every lesson . The workshop connect teacher community resource train teacher : structure/flow lesson , lesson activities/content , cooking/preparation skill , available resources/materials . Sustainability Measures : During Sprouts intervention sustainability year , investigator collect pilot data sustainability strategy implement intervention control school . Structured interview conduct GLC member document member information , leadership structure , meeting times/places , garden designed/built , workshop offered/attended , fundraise medium event , type produce harvest , produce use distribution plan , community resource leverage , barrier future action plan . Structured interview conduct teacher , principal , administration staff , GLCs , district director staff evaluate various aspect program include : ) use maintenance garden ; b ) successful unsuccessful components/strategies implement sustain program ; c ) additional material/resources/training request and/or need . Participant Screening/Recruitment : Sixteen elementary school allocate either Sprouts intervention ( n=8 school ) Control group ( n=8 school ) . All participant parent sign assent consent form , approve UT-Austin 's Institutional Review Board . Based previous intervention work Hispanic community , investigator anticipate ~50 % parent consent child participate , child complete baseline measure . The investigator anticipate 15 % attrition post-intervention measurement due parents/students move away sick absent school . Based parental participation rate Los Angeles ( LA ) Sprouts , investigator anticipate 25 % parent return parental baseline questionnaire , investigator assume 15 % attrition rate post-testing . Based blood draw participation rate LA Sprouts , investigator anticipate 50 % participate child ( n=1,200 ) also participate blood draw pre-intervention 40 % ( n=960 60 per school ) post-intervention . Data Management Analyses : Data merge , edit , clean use system file create REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) , secure web application build manage database . The database ideal field data collection accessible key personnel location . All data enter use double data entry method . Summary statistic , graphical analysis , frequency distribution use describe data intervention control group . Data transform need . The investigator handle miss data use two primary approach : multiple imputation full information maximum likelihood estimation method . For Aim 1 : The investigator test child parent participate Sprouts compare control increase change average consumption vegetable serving per day decrease average change BMI z-scores , waist circumference , fast glucose , insulin use well-known statistical method cluster randomize trial . Several analytic strategy employ determine effect intervention vegetable intake many primary outcome variable . The investigator plan conduct two-stage nested analysis variance model , special case mixed effect linear regression model also know repeated measure analysis variance model . The term model include true mean outcome variable , fix effect intervention arm , one random cluster effect ( school ) , random error term . In case , school ( cluster ) regard nest within intervention arm student parent within school ( cluster ) . The analytic approach secondary outcome measure ( i.e. , blood pressure , percent body fat , metabolic syndrome , adipocytokines , dietary intake variable , related dietary psychosocial behavior ) involve similar use linear mixed model . For Aim 2 : To test effect Sprouts intervention change vegetable intake availability relate dietary behavior parent , investigator use similar well-known statistical method describe Aim 1 . For Exploratory Aim , investigator conduct descriptive statistic collect pilot data sustainability strategy ( qualitative quantitative data obtain via structured interview focus group ) intervention control school .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Weight status : Normal weight child ( age sexspecific BMI &lt; 85th percentile base CDC BMI growth charts68 ) overweight obese child ( BMI≥85th percentile ) . Gender Age : Students 3rd5th grade ( 8 11 ) parent Hispanic Origin : This study include ethnicities/races ; however , select school &gt; 50 % Hispanic , therefore , expect majority student parent Hispanic . Children parent presently take medication ( ) diagnose disease could influence dietary intake body composition Previously diagnose major illness since birth ( e.g . chronic birth asphyxia , cancer , etc . ) Any physical , cognitive , psychological disability would prevent participation study .</criteria>
