	<brief_title>The Effect Dream Doctors Children Undergoing Digestive Endoscopic Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect Dream Doctors child undergo digestive endoscopic procedure : Physiological biological assessment emotional cognitive consequence . Background : Since advent pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy early 1970 's , remarkable increase number diagnostic therapeutic procedure perform infant child . Performance endoscopy child require patience , experience , expertise adult . The anxiety child related parent 's separation , loss self-control , unknown surroundings strange people take care , frequently unpleasant even painful procedure . Painful frightening procedure child show result short-term physiologic change long-term behavioral change . The response unpleasant stimulus stress fear may exaggerate child experienced pain . Most infant child many teenager need deep sedation light general anesthesia complete successful safe procedure . Induction general anesthesia stressful procedure . Strategies reduce preanesthesia anxiety include pharmacologic non-pharmacologic intervention . However , evidence base mainly self report rather objective measurement . Therefore , objective non-invasive measurement utilized current study , provide assessment tool regardless child 's age . Multiple study , begin 1970 's , show humor many positive effect physical mental health well-being . Previous investigation report humor beneficial effect immune system , stress relate potentially fatal illness , pain tolerance , mental function . Dream doctor professional medical clown stage artist , receive training specifically understand medical patient 's need give patient adjuvant therapy hospital admission ambulatory treatment . Laughter physiological effect different body mechanism affect cardiovascular system ( decrease heart rate blood pressure ) , strengthen immune system , lower level stress hormone like Norepinephrine . Humor also help strengthen bond therapist patient reduce stress anxiety enhance recovery . The Israel dream doctor project , integrate professional medical clown medical service provide Israeli hospital . The DDs part multidisciplinary staff , principally , pediatric ward . Studies already prove presence medical clown significantly reduce level anxiety induction anesthesia child . In pediatric ward Afula Medical Center , investigator experience DDs prepare child kidney scan . Pre-Puls Inhibition PPI A computerized human startle response monitoring system ( SR-HLAB STARTLE REFLEX , San Diego Instruments , San Diego , CA ) use deliver acoustic startle stimulus via headphone record score correspond electro myographic activity orbicularis oculi muscle . Two disposable electrode ( sensor area 12 mm2 ) place approximately 0.75-1cm pupil orbicularis oculi muscle 3rd reference electrode mastoid bone . The skin area electrode site clean cotton swab saturate rub alcohol , prepare gently rub small amount EEG &amp; ECG Skin Prepping Gel ( Signa Gel- Parker Laboratories Inc. , Fairfield , New jersey , USA ) , clean cotton swab . The session ( total 56 trial ) start 3 min acclimatization period 60 dB background noise level deliver continuously throughout test session . The session comprise two block . block1 : comprise randomly deliver six trial single 40 msec 120 dB `` pulse alone '' startle stimuli order evaluate startle response , ten `` pre '' stimulus ( 74 , 78 , 82 , 86 92 dB ) , thirty `` pre pulse '' trial consist single 120 dB pulse precede ( 120 msec inter-stimulus-interval ) 20 msec pre pulse 14 , 18 , 22 , 26 32 dB background ( i.e. , 74 , 78 , 82 , 86 92 dB ) . Block1 trial deliver average 20 sec inter-trial-interval ITI ( 15-25 sec , total 46 trial ) . Block2 : comprise last ten trial `` pulse alone '' startle , fix 2 sec ITI order evaluate measure habituation response repeat delivery startling stimulus . Finally , prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) calculate percent habituate response follow [ 100- ( max response `` pre pulse '' trial / max response `` pulse alone '' trial X 100 ) ] GSR - Galvanic Skin Response Electrodermal activity measure difference skin conductivity . Two 5 mm electrode place finger 2 4 non-dominant hand . The electrode connect sensor amplify receiver 10Hz sample rate . Different portion skin show difference conductivity , due sweat related stress . Thus , measure skin conductivity non-dominant hand show reduce variability . Hypothesis study : 1 ) DDs lessen level anxiety attention impairment child undergo gastroscopy . 2 ) DDs improve satisfaction child parent gastroscopy . The aim study : 1 ) To explore influence DDs satisfaction child parent undergo gastroscopy , utilize questioner . 2 ) To explore effect DDs anxiety attention child parent , undergo gastroscopy mean GSR , startle response pre-pulse inhibition ( PPI ) test measure anxiety-related biologic index . Patients Methods : This randomize , control study conduct child undergo deep sedation pediatric upper gastrointestinal endoscopy Gastroenterology institute Emek Medical Center , Afula , Israel . One hundred child ( age 1-18 year ) schedule undergo deep sedation elective gastroscopy enrol . During enrollment , potential clown involvement explain parent . Patients assign one two group : Group 1 : child parent presence DD upon arrival Gastroenterology institute throughout induction sedation , gastroscopy recovery . Group 2 : child parent undergo gastroscopy deep sedation without presence DD . The randomization process : In Afula Medical Center , investigator perform gastroscopy weekly . During study period investigator perform gastroscopy one week DD one week without DD.The patient aware fact week DD participate sedation induction patient ( every week ) . The DD use various method entertain child alleviate stress accord child 's age . The parent child give anxiety questioner fill induction sedation . At end gastroscopy parent child give satisfaction questioner . The child perform Pre-Pulse inhibition ( PPI ) test GSR gastroscopy assess physiological biological emotional cognitive consequence . The parent perform PPI test GSR , gastroscopy ( caffeine nicotine consumption allow 30min examination ) . The anesthesiologist nurse recovery room fill questioner evaluate behavior child induction sedation awaken . While insert IV line blood spot take stress hormone : cortisol , epinephrine , norepinephrine . The following physical index measure : blood pressure , pulse , saturation body temperature . The amount drug give deep sedation evaluate . The current study hold two major innovativeness : ( ) The effect DD part medical team gastroscopy child . ( b ) The physiological biological evaluation emotional cognitive consequence child parent gastroscopy . Statistical analysis : The study design Mixed design ( 2X3 ) , DD subject factor ( without DD ) stage treatment within subject factor ( prior , gastroscopy examination ) .Thus , conduct Two-Way ANOVA ( 2X3 ) post hoc Tukey 's test . Significant interaction analyze One-Way ANOVA . Moreover relate physiological biological measurement questioner item , Pearson 's correlation calculate . The study schedule : 1 . Recruitment : 1.5 year 2 . Study period : patient study hold day gastroscopy . 3 . Examination blood serum ELISA : 3 month . 3 . Analysis result : three month 4 . Targeted date completion project : two year study begin . Project staff : 1 . Dr Peleg Sarit - Board certify Pediatrics Pediatric Gastroenterology Nutrition . 2 .
