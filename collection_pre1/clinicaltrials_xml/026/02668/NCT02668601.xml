	<brief_summary>Our study aim examine effect intrauterine exposure GDM metabolic risk Hispanic child . Our primary hypothesis predict intrauterine exposure GDM associate one three critical factor involve development diabetes : 1 ) increase adiposity , 2 ) insulin resistance , 3 ) decrease beta cell function Hispanic child compare non-exposed child match ethnicity , age , gender , Tanner stage . In subset cohort , also examine effect intrauterine exposure gestational diabetes brain pathway regulate appetite body weight child age 6 15 year old .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal GDM Hispanic Youth : Risk Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity rate increase dramatically last two decade , particularly child . Obesity major risk factor type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , disproportionate prevalence obesity T2D people Hispanic origin . While number factor contribute development obesity T2D compelling evidence suggest profound role diabetic utero environment . Epidemiological study show exposure maternal diabetes utero associate significant risk develop obesity diabetes later life . Provocative study animal model suggest metabolic imprint result exposure alter metabolic milieu diabetes pregnancy lead abnormality development specific fetal tissue , include hypothalamus pancreatic islet . Based finding , goal research test hypothesis exposure maternal gestational diabetes mellitus utero result change intrauterine development mediate increase risk obesity diabetes . Through ongoing study genetics type 2 diabetes access hundred Hispanic offspring well characterize GDM control mother . We , therefore , unique position perform mechanistic study examine effect intrauterine exposure GDM metabolic risk Hispanic child adolescent . Our primary hypothesis predict intrauterine exposure GDM associate one three critical factor involve development diabetes : 1 ) increase adiposity , 2 ) insulin resistance , 3 ) decrease beta cell function Hispanic child compare non-exposed child match ethnicity , age , gender , Tanner stage . To examine effect exposure GDM brain pathway involve regulation energy homeostasis , perform additional functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study subset large cohort .</detailed_description>
