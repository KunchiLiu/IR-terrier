	<detailed_description>Arterial catheterization often perform critically ill patient continuous hemodynamic monitoring blood sampling . However , insertion radial artery catheter traditional palpation may technically challenge , particularly pediatric patient . There publish study use ultrasound guidance radial-artery catheter placement mostly elective surgery child receive inhalation deep sedative medication . Recently set publish pediatric intensive care unit .</detailed_description>
