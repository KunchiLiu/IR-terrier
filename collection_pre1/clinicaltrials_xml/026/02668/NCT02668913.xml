	<brief_summary>This pilot feasibility study assess use commercial molecular profile service UK 's National Health Service ( NHS ) . The impact knowledge patient 's molecular profile , time take generate knowledge , assess analysis change physician ' treatment decision prior follow generation patient 's molecular profile . Implications benefit therapy recommend profile also assess follow treatment outcome collect : best response ( base routine clinical , radiological biochemical assessment ) , progression free survival ratio ( post Caris Molecular profile versus prior treatment ) overall survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The concept molecular profile lead personalise medicine base hypothesis use treatment select molecular profile approach favourably change clinical course individual patient . In order best determine next step particular patient 's clinical course , necessary understand patient diagnose , treat respond treatment past , also fully characterize molecular profile patient 's tumour , maximum information potential positive negative treatment outcome gather . In pilot feasibility study , treatment plan devise individual patient treat oncologist assess . The primary endpoint frequency oncologist change treatment plan base tumour 's molecular phenotype respective drug consider associate high likelihood benefit lack benefit . Ultimately however , treatment decision remain hand treat physician study protocol prescribe dictate use particular treatment . In patient recurrent ovarian cancer gynecological malignancy standard care define , treatment currently choose empirically base population-based response rate . With use molecular profiling treat physician get chance revise treatment plan consider individual molecular profile patient 's tumour light know predictive power biomarkers efficacy certain drug .</detailed_description>
