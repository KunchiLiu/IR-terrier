	<brief_title>Pasireotide LAR Pegvisomant Study Acromegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pasireotide Long Acting Release ( Signifor ® ) , novel long-acting multi-receptor ligand somatostatin analogue , show effective treatment GH-secreting pituitary adenoma currently use long-acting somatostatin analogue ( LA-SSAs ) . The long-term efficacy acromegaly patient use LA-SSAs combination PEGV 90 % term normalization IGF-I . The combination PEGV pasireotide LAR study yet . Combining PEGV pasireotide LAR could result low dose less injection pegvisomant . This may ultimately lead cost-effective treatment improve quality life .</detailed_description>
