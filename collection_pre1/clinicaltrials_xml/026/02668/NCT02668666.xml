	<brief_title>Palbociclib Combination With Tamoxifen First Line Therapy Metastatic Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center trial . INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : - Palbociclib 125 mg administer orally daily day 1-21 ( D1-D21 ) 28-day cycle . Subjects take palbociclib D22-D28 . - Tamoxifen 20 mg administer orally daily every day 28-day cycle ( i.e. , continuously ) . Palbociclib take food combination tamoxifen . Subjects take dose approximately time day . It encourage , mandatory , premenopausal subject also receive treatment goserelin equivalent ( e.g. , Lupron ) give injectable subcutaneous implant D1 every 28 day cycle every 3 month . Disease assessment perform completion every 2 cycle . Treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , subject refusal , subject death either progression disease , therapy , cause . Subjects voluntarily stop study , progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity follow total 24 month discontinuation study drug . To demonstrate adequate organ function , screen lab perform within 14 day prior registration protocol therapy : Hematological ( must meet ALL follow criterion ) : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 × 10 9/L - Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL - Platelet count ≥ 100 × 10 9/L Renal ( must meet ONE follow criterion ) : - Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN - Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 × ULN , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) ≥ 40 mL/min Hepatic ( must meet ALL follow criterion ) : - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN ≤ 5 × ULN subject know hepatic metastasis - Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN ≤ 5 × ULN subject know hepatic metastasis - Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow applicable inclusion criterion participate study : Female ≥ 18 year age time consent . NOTE : Both pre postmenopausal woman eligible . Premenopausal status define either : Last menstrual period within last 12 month . In case therapyinduced amenorrhea , plasma estradiol /or FSH premenopausal range per local normal range . Women locoregional recurrent metastatic disease , determine biopsy metastatic lesion , amenable curative therapy . Histologically and/or cytologically confirm diagnosis ER positive and/or PR positive ( ER &gt; 1 % , PR &gt; 1 % ) , HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer . NOTE : Subject HER2negative breast cancer ( base recently analyze biopsy ) define negative situ hybridization test IHC status 0 , 1+ 2+ . If IHC 2+ , negative situ hybridization ( FISH , CISH , SISH ) test require local laboratory test . Metastatic disease evaluable imaging study . Subjects may measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 boneonly disease . Boneonly subject eligible disease documented/ evaluate bone scan , CT MRI . Their disease assess use MDA criterion . No prior systemic anticancer therapy advance HR+ disease . NOTE : Subjects receive adjuvant treatment aromatase inhibitor time recurrence allow participate .

NOTE : HIPAA authorization may include informed consent obtain separately . Women childbearing potential ( WOCP ) must pregnant breastfeeding . A negative serum urine pregnancy test require within 72 hour study registration woman childbearing potential . If urine test confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Women childbearing potential ( WOCP ) must willing use two effective method birth control use double barrier method ( condom , sponge , diaphragm , vaginal ring spermicidal jelly cream ) , total abstinence course study 120 day last dose study drug . The use hormonal contraceptive discourage . NOTE : Women consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy ) . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Subjects meet criterion may participate study : Prior treatment CDK 4/6 inhibitor . Confirmed diagnosis HER2 positive disease . Known uncontrolled symptomatic CNS metastasis . Subjects know brain metastasis eligible tumor treat definitive resection /or radiotherapy neurologically stable least 1 month steroid . Subjects advance , symptomatic , visceral spread life expectancy le 4 month . Prior ( neo ) adjuvant treatment tamoxifen within 12 month study entry . Prior history blood clot , pulmonary embolism deep vein thrombosis . Subjects impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . Subject concurrent malignancy malignancy within 3 year randomization , exception adequately treat basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell skin carcinoma , nonmelanomatous skin cancer curatively resect cervical cancer . Subject concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition would , investigator 's judgment , contraindicate subject participation clinical study . Subject currently receive follow substance discontinue 7 day prior start treatment : Known strong inducer inhibitor CYP3A4/5 , include grapefruit , grapefruit hybrid , pomelo , starfruit , Seville oranges . Medications narrow therapeutic window predominantly metabolize CYP3A4/5 . Known strong inducer inhibitor CYP2D6 . Subject major surgery within 14 day prior start study drug recover major side effect surgery . Known history human immunodeficiency virus [ ( HIV ) HIV 1/2 antibody ] . Known active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) ( test mandatory ) Any clinically significant infection define acute viral , bacterial , fungal infection require specific treatment . NOTE : Antiinfective treatment must complete ≥ 7 day prior study registration . Any severe , uncontrolled medical condition , include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus unstable congestive heart failure Known allergy palbociclib excipients Presence nonhealing wound , fracture , ulcer within 28 day prior study registration . Any condition , opinion investigator , might jeopardize safety subject interfere protocol compliance . Any mental medical condition prevents subject give informed consent participate trial . Treatment investigational agent within 28 day prior registration protocol therapy subject must recover acute toxic effect regimen .</criteria>
