	<brief_title>Assessing Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Site Using Different Endoscopic Imaging Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Residual neoplasia EMR common . Optimal surveillance protocol clearly define . There need good image modality evaluate residual disease . Suspected residual tissue confirm repeat colonoscopy empirically treat . However , lead either frequent colonoscopy overtreatment . This present cost financial burden patient . With introduction newer colonscopes near focus/zoom capability , important ass whether near focus technology offer well accuracy detection residual neoplastic tissue . With good accuracy confidently rule residual neoplasia use new image modality , additional treatment biopsy previous EMR may avoid . Furthermore , interval surveillance colonscopy lengthen . Hypothesis study : Using standard white light without near focus provide good sensitivity negative predictive value compare narrow band image without near focus assess previous endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) site residual neoplasia</detailed_description>
