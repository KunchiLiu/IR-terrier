	<brief_title>Investigating Use Drains ( Internal ) Quilting Sutures Seroma Formation Following Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The mainstay treatment majority breast cancer surgical excision primary tumour either remove lump ( wide local excision ) whole breast , mastectomy . Breast cancer commonly spread lymph node armpit ( axilla ) meaning surgery remove cancer also involve surgery axilla sample lymph node . The common complication follow mastectomy fluid collection deep wound call seroma . This generally minor complication may cause significant discomfort / distress patient . If seroma significant size cause discomfort , usually drain use needle syringe near wound . This improve patient discomfort , seromas lead wound heal problem may delay onset adjuvant treatment , radio- chemotherapy . The incidence seroma variable , commonly quote incidence seroma formation 15 % 27 % . In bid reduce seroma formation , surgeon use drain follow mastectomy theoretically remove excess fluid may accumulate follow surgery . This current practice unit North Tees . Despite widespread use drain follow mastectomy , clear evidence suggest use drain significantly reduces seroma formation . There also consensus guideline use postoperative drain . Most surgeon advocate removal drain volume drain less 50ml/day . Patients drain in-situ may keep inpatient drain removal , others may go home drain frequent review home breast care nurse team . As consequence , drain may contribute long postoperative stay also link higher postoperative pain score . The nature behaviour seromas remain ambiguous ; hard predicting patient trouble . There one argument however , seroma fluid may increase presence drain . This drain may irritate tissue underneath wound , result tissue produce fluid may accumulate seroma . Therefore , lie theoretical basis drain avoid altogether . Other measure adopt drain bid reduce seroma formation . One main one use 'quilting suture ' deep wound . These previously use either addition drain without . Quilting suture aim reduce 'free space ' left tissue follow removal breast adhere tissue together . The free space , commonly call 'dead space ' risk factor accumulation fluid . It show study without drain , suture ( stitch ) reduce incidence seroma reduce length inpatient stay . Aim/Objective : This pilot study aim determine effect drain quilt suture incidence symptomatic seroma formation follow mastectomy axillary surgery breast cancer . A symptomatic seroma define fluid collection beneath mastectomy wound develop post-operatively , cause tension heal wound discomfort patient , thus need drainage . This usually approximately 100mls great quantity fluid . Outcome measure : See Population Eligibility Criteria : see Sample size : This feasibility study recruit patient four NHS Foundation Trusts North-East England ( North Tees Hartlepool , Northumbria , Gateshead Newcastle Hospitals ) . The principle research centre North Tees . No power calculation use determine sample size . A small sample use assess feasibility intervention aim use study pilot large study future would sample base power calculation . Seroma incidence quote around 15-27 % .2 University Hospital North Tees Hartlepool alone treat approximately 500 patient diagnose breast cancer every year . Each centre recruit 30 patient , approximate 10 per group . This give total sample size 120 patient . Subjects recruit breast clinic consent surgery . They approach regard study part consent process . Randomisation process : Block randomisation use computer generate opaque seal envelope sequence stratified centre . Variable block size preferable necessary give three arm study multiple study site . According site , participant label four block 30 randomisation make sure site allocate 10 group . These label A1-30 D1-30 . The reason method participant label 1-120 , would need someone always access next randomisation group . As pilot study , would facility 24-hour randomisation call-line . Participants allocate either group 1 , 2 3 ( detail 'Study Procedure ' ) . Informed write consent : Consent study take time consent surgery breast clinic . This undertaken specific consent form . The patient also give information leaflet time , option return another clinic consenting later . Study Procedure : Patients eligible consent subject study randomize one three group receive treatment hospital present . Pre-operative practice operative technique standardise site routine practice . Group 1 allocate receive drain intra-operatively . Group 2 receive drain intervention . Group 3 receive drain receive quilt suture . A sealed envelope open theatre nursing staff immediately wound closure reveal randomisation code . Patients group 2 3 breast care nurse blind regard use quilting suture . Surgery carry consultant experienced registrar . Subjects group 1 discharge hospital ambulatory pain control oral analgesia . They may go home drain in-situ discharge drain remove . The drain either case remove output le 50ml 24h . Patients group 2 3 discharge ambulatory similarly analgesic requirement meet oral preparation . Patients follow breast clinic two week post surgery . Those randomised receive drain ( Groups 2 3 ) anticipate longer postoperative inpatient stay . On contrary , anticipated may discharge sooner group 1 . End study : The end study mark subject ' seromas cease symptomatic needing drainage . Participants follow routinely within breast clinic part on-going cancer management . Assessment safety : No additional toxicity data require include . Any adverse event safety issue deal accordance standard hospital protocol . Subject withdrawal : Patients free withdraw study time . This may define pre post intervention . The reason withdrawal note patient record . Data recording : Each patient assign case report form . The patient review 24h post-operatively data collect clinician . At 24h , data drainage volume drain group , pain score examination wound conduct . Pain score 48h scoring system also use . Pain score record use validate visual analogue score ( VAS ) . The patient review day hospital discharge . Upon discharge , breast care nurse collect data seroma incidence , aspiration volume wound care . Data enter secure hospital-based Microsoft Excel spreadsheet . Transfer data via NHS.net NHS.net email ensure security . Statistical consideration : This pilot study require small patient number therefore descriptive statistic use . Source data/documents/confidentiality : The Data Protection Act , NHS Research Governance Framework relevant NHS code practice follow regard collection , storage , processing disclosure personal study information . Participants give study number onset trial , link personal data separate database . The main data collect reference unique study number thus data anonymised kept confidential . Data collect case report form . This entered secure hospital-based spreadsheet . The researcher access data . No patient identifiable detail remove hospital site . All paper copy file hospital-based master research file . The patient consent form file subject ' hospital record . As four-centre study , data transfer site North Tees however patient identifiable information transfer study reference number . Transfer secure NHS.net email account data hold 5 year . Quality control &amp; quality assurance : This low risk trial major issue anticipate . A formal data monitoring committee need . Either Consultant Surgeons highly skilled specialist registrar carry surgery . Patients closely follow surgical team breast care nurse open access breast care service . If however high complication rate experience particular group , method stop . Quality control maintain strict adherence study protocol , principle GCP , research governance clinical trial regulation . Ethical consideration : The main ethical issue surround trial two third patient receive current practice four trust , receive drain . However , suggest receive drain , less favourable outcome . The main risk patient symptomatic seroma , may require drainage . However , patient risk seromas whether drain put , actually receive drain , may lower incidence seroma , less pain time hospital . There strict compliance principle Declaration Helsinki MRC/ICH good clinical practice .</detailed_description>
