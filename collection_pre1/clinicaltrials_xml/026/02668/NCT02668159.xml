	<detailed_description>Sedentary lifestyle excess calorie intake contribute dramatic increase occurrence obesity , metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) , type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) The first step reduce excessive CVD risk associate presence MetS adoption healthier lifestyle . A balanced diet , include high-nutritive low-energy food fish , important component healthy diet . Fish major source n-3 PUFA , high-quality protein , essential nutrient vitamin D. Fish consumption may therefore improve component MetS reduce incidence T2D CVD obese subjects.The foundation project stem well-recognized fact Canadians meet weekly dietary recommendation fish consumption ( i.e . 2 servings/week ) thus intakes n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) fish protein low general population , even low obese subject . Since people simply dislike fish certain type fish contain toxic contaminant , include heavy metal environmental pollutant , fish consumption remain low . Therefore , dietary choice limit intake key nutrient , thus increase risk MetS , T2D CVD . Also , fish one rich food source dietary vitamin D may also contribute health benefit fish consumption . Indeed , currently estimate ∼40 % Canadians low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] concentration ( ≤50 nM ) ∼70 % 75 nM . In addition , obesity important risk factor low serum 25 ( OH ) D.The main objective study investigate acute effect mechanisms action fish peptide vitamin D glucose metabolism , parameter insulin sensibility secretion , cardiometabolic risk profile overweight men . A four-arm randomized crossover design use test metabolic effect consume prior 3h-oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , supplement contain either fish peptide ( 3 gram ) , vitamin D3 ( 1000 IU ) , combination fish peptide + vitamin D3 placebo .</detailed_description>
