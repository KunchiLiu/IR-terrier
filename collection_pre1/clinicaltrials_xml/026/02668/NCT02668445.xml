	<brief_title>Molecular Response After Concurrent Exercise With Low Glycogen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two experimental exercise trial ; low carbohydrate ( = LOW ) high carbohydrate ( = HIGH ) trial . During experimental day subject complete continue submaximal cycle bout morning follow resistance exercise session early afternoon . During LOW trial subject receive low carbohydrate mixed meal , HIGH trial subject provide high carbohydrate meal . In addition , experimental day subject receive adequate protein beverage . Lastly , protein provide post resistance exercise .</detailed_description>
