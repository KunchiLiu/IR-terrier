	<detailed_description>T2D pose significant public health problem . Hyperglycemia associate variety vascular complication , clinical trial medication regime design achieve near-normal HbA1c mostly negative . The lack benefit observe trial may due fact target HbA1c rather glucose variability , conduct patient establish T2D already experience complication disease . In early T2D , management postprandial glycemia may particularly important minimization metabolic memory effect preservation beta cell function . Postprandial glycemia early T2D largely driven dietary intake , research finding guide clinician regard best dietary approach prescribe mixed . Studies do , to-date , use one-size-fits-all dietary regime take consideration person 's unique glycemic response food . The investigator know decade research behavioral method require engage patient lifestyle behavior change . The investigator argue tailor approach participant 's glycemic response gut microbiome enhance self-efficacy way achieve standard behavioral method alone , turn , reduce glycemic variability metabolic memory effect . Co-PI Segal et al . demonstrate subject high between-subject variability postprandial response food , suggest universal dietary recommendation limit utility control elevate postprandial glucose . The machine learn algorithm devise group integrate multidimensional data accurately predict personalize postprandial glycemic response . In subsequent validation study 100 participant , show personally-tailored intervention base predict response result significantly improve postprandial glycemic response , accompany beneficial change gut microbiota .</detailed_description>
