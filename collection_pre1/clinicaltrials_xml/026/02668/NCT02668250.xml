	<detailed_description>The population expand age . With increase age population demographic life expectancy , number elderly patient ( age â‰¥ 80 ) undergoing surgery rise . Elderly patient constitute increasingly large proportion high-risk surgical group . In 2010 , patient age 80 yr represent 2.1 % patient undergoing high risk surgery France ( PMSI database ) , concentrate 27 % in-hospital death . Cardiac complication postoperative pulmonary complication equally prevalent contribute similarly morbidity , mortality , length hospital stay . Specific optimization strategy general anesthesia test high-risk patient undergo major surgery improve outcome . Meta-analyses demonstrate goal direct hemodynamic therapy significantly reduce mortality surgical complication high-risk patient . A lung-protective ventilation strategy high-risk patient undergo major abdominal surgery associate improved clinical outcome . Retrospective study indicate combination excessive depth anesthesia , hypotension low anesthesia requirement result increased mortality . These approach peroperative care remain discussed literature also incorporated common clinical practice . Moreover , review perform sensitive analysis elderly . Whether multi-parametric optimization strategy anesthesia include several specific intervention impact short-term postoperative major morbidity mortality elderly know . The addition depth anesthesia monitor hemodynamic monitoring goal direct hemodynamic therapy may improve tissue perfusion reduce hemodynamic side effect anesthetic agent , particularly elderly therapeutic window agent reduce . The effect low protective ventilation may also additive previous measure reduce perioperative build-up oxygen debt . Our hypothesis combine optimization strategy anesthesia concern hemodynamic , ventilation , depth anesthesia may improve short- long- term outcome elderly undergoing high risk surgery .</detailed_description>
