	<brief_summary>The purpose project evaluate whether omega-3 fatty acid supplementation ( combine eicosapentaenoic acid docosahexaenoic acid [ EPA/DHA ] supplement ) augment effect 12-week resistance training program old men . Outcome variable include inflammatory biomarkers systemic circulation , body composition performance measure . The specific inflammatory marker blood include : C-reactive protein , tumor necrosis factor-α , interleukin-1β , interleukin-6 . Remaining parameter include : body composition ( assessed dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) , muscle strength ( assessed chest press leg press one-repetition maximum strength test ) , functional ability ( assess time go test well 6-minute walk test ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Summary : Sarcopenia prevalent health concern many old individual find strategy ameliorate reduce loss skeletal muscle mass strength deem important maintain functional ability independence individual 's age . Currently , resistance training consider standard care induce anabolic stimulus preserve well enhance muscle mass strength age individual . One mechanism whereby old adult seem lose muscle mass age via chronic low grade inflammation . Finding complementary strategy reduce inflammation , time building skeletal muscle mass strength , consider essential combating increase prevalence sarcopenia observe population age . Using nutritional supplementation strategy , omega-3 fatty acid , seem provide effect reduce inflammation also act anabolic stimulus skeletal muscle growth . It know whether provide omega-3 fatty acid ( form EPA/DHA supplementation ) along resistance training result great increase skeletal muscle mass strength resistance training alone old population . Hypotheses : The primary hypothesis research project omega-3 fatty acid supplementation resistance train 12 week decrease marker inflammation resistance training placebo cohort old adult . A secondary hypothesis project omega-3 fatty acid supplementation resistance train 12 week provide great increase skeletal muscle mass , strength , functional ability resistance training placebo cohort old adult .</detailed_description>
