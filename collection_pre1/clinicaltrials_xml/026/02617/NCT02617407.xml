	<brief_title>Livionex Oral Microbiome Dental Plaque Control HSCT Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized ( 2:1 ) pilot study . A total 30 child undergo HSCT able cooperate saliva collection dental exam enrol study . Rational : As chemotherapy radiation therapy result break-down mucosal barrier , HSCT recipients significant risk bacteremia sepsis oral pathogen . Children undergoing HSCT significant difficulty achieve good oral hygiene dental plaque control sensitivity oral tissue lead intolerance teeth brush standard dentifrice . This usually result plaque buildup moderate severe gingival inflammation , persist transplantation . The investigator hypothesize improved oral hygiene well plaque control HSCT recipient may result reduced oral inflammation , decrease amount oral bacterial pathogen , reduce risk oral-pathogen related bacterial infection . Primary Objectives : To evaluate adherence oral hygiene use daily compliance log evaluate efficacy Livionex速 compare standard toothpaste PreviDent速 5000 plus plaque gingivitis reduction HSCT recipient . Study duration : Therapy 7 day follow-ups 44 day . It take 25 month enroll patient complete follow-up . Safety Assessments : The incidence bacteremia oral pathogen follow 44 day first day intervention . The investigator anticipate risk bacteremia cause oral pathogen decrease study procedure ; however , significantly increase incidence bacteremia oral pathogen document either case control , study stop . Efficacy : The investigator measure adherence protocol teeth brush twice per day use test control dentifrice . The investigator evaluate change dental plaque score gingival inflammation day 0 7 , 44 patient , well compare plaque score gingival inflammation test control group . At baseline , day 7 , day 44 , optical coherence tomography use image thereby quantify plaque presence . Also , plaque stain perform standardized photograph take allow plaque distribution mapping . On day , saliva sample collect 1.0 mL blood take daily morning blood draw . Saliva ( 2.0 mL ) culture total viable bacteria oral streptococci . Saliva blood assess full bacterial profile use shotgun sequencing ( microbiome ) . Unique Aspects This Study : This study use new dentifrice show improve plaque control pediatric HSCT recipient goal improve plaque control HSCT . This first study explore composition plaque oral microbiome pediatric HSCT recipient . This study gather data possible link oral microbiome systemic bacteremia HSCT , effect plaque reduction oral microbiome , effect systemic antibiotic use oral microbiome .</detailed_description>
