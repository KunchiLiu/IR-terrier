	<brief_summary>The new P2Y12 inhibitor prasugrel ( Efient®-Effient® ) ticagrelor ( Brilique®-Brilinta® ) show promising result respective TRITON PLATO trial make prasugrel ticagrelor recommend first line treatment acute coronary syndrome ACS ( ESC Guidelines : Class 1 LOE B ) . These two drug show superiority clopidogrel ACS patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , dramatic diminution stent thrombosis , reduction death Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) well reduction death meta-analysis . The field elective PCI ( stable patient ) study 2 new drug clopidogrel remain standard care . However , off-label use prasugrel ticagrelor increase patient undergo high risk elective PCI ( leave main , diabetic , multiple stenting , high risk stent thrombosis , clopidogrel pretreatment… ) support scientific evidence . More half PCI patient undergo elective stenting proven ischemia and/or stable angina , relatively safe procedure use late generation stent . However complication remain either frequent consider PCI-related myonecrosis/myocardial injury link prognosis patient rare serious consider stent thrombosis , Q wave MI stroke , leave room improvement two new drug . The investigator propose perform multicenter international study stable patient undergo elective PCI randomization clopidogrel ticagrelor . The investigator hypothesize study show superiority new P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel elective PCI primary ischemic endpoint ( peri-procedural MI myocardial injury ) without significant excess bleeding ( BARC definition ) .</brief_summary>
