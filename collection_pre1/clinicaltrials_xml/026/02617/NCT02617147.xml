	<brief_title>Choroidal Thickness Vitrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since development new OCT modality , like enhance depth swept-source OCT imaging , good visualization evaluation retinal structure choroidea become possible . 23G Vitrectomy membrane peel seem influence posterior segment structure eye data show clear evidence evaluate change surgery . Only little information currently available influence change result vitreous surgery central choroidea . Hence , aim study evaluate influence result choroidea use two different OCT device . To assess influence vitrectomy change central choroidea compare result image choroidea two different OCT device . This prospective , open , non-randomized , observational , MPG study This study perform Department Ophthalmology , Medical University Vienna . 40 Patients undergo vitrectomy include study . The investigation help gain new information effect vitrectomy choroid . The measuring procedure use study well tolerate use routine clinical practice non-invasive .</detailed_description>
