	<brief_summary>During video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy ( VATS ) , surgeon insert small camera attach thoracoscope put image onto video screen . Instruments insert via small incision , lung resection complete . Robotic thoracic surgery ( RTS ) use similar minimally invasive approach , precise instrument involve RTS allow surgeon view lung use 3-dimensional imaging . The instrument give surgeon increase range motion surgery , research demonstrate RTS less steep learn curve compare VATS . Both VATS RTS demonstrate good result compare traditional thoracotomy ( open surgery ) . However , Robotic lobectomy yet compare directly video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy ( VATS ) prospective manner . There two major barrier widespread adoption robotic thoracic surgery . The first barrier lack high-quality prospective data . To knowledge , prospective trial compare VATS RTS early stage lung cancer . The second major barrier widespread adoption robotic technology thoracic surgery perceive high cost Robotic lobectomy . To address barrier , investigator undertake first randomize control trial compare Thoracoscopic Lobectomy Robotic Lobectomy early stage lung cancer . Prospective randomization eliminate bias retrospective data serve determine whether exist advantage Health Related Quality life ( HRQOL ) patient outcomes favour Robotic Lobectomy VATS Lobectomy . Furthermore , prospective cost-utility analysis , trial provide high quality data evaluate true economic impact robotic technology thoracic surgery Canadian health system .</brief_summary>
