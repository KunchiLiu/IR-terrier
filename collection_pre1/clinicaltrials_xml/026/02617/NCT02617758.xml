	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study Fentanyl Transdermal System ( JNJ-35685-AAA-G021 ) Compared With DURAGESIC Fentanyl Transdermal Patch Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single application 2-way Crossover ( medication provide participant different sequence ) pivotal study determine bioequivalence market reference formulation DURAGESIC test formulation Fentanyl transdermal system ( JNJ-35685-AAA-G021 ) . Approximately 56 healthy participant participate study . Participants randomly assign 1 2 treatment sequence . The study consist 3 part : Screening Phase ( within 21 day first study drug administration first period ) , open-label treatment Phase consist 2 single-application treatment period ( 26 day ) End-of-Study ( end Period 2 ) . The total study duration participant 43 day maximum 59 day . Participants receive single application 100 microgram per hour ( mcg/h ) dose DURAGESIC fentanyl transdermal system Treatment A ( Reference ) 100 mcg/h Fentanyl transdermal system ( JNJ-35685-AAA-G021 ) Treatment B ( Test ) . Bioequivalence primarily evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant must healthy basis physical examination , medical history , vital sign , 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) perform Screening . This determination must record participant 's source document initial investigator Not childbearing potential : postmenopausal [ great ( &gt; ) 45 year age amenorrhea least 12 month ; permanently sterilize ( example , bilateral tubal occlusion [ include tubal ligation procedure consistent local regulation ] , hysterectomy , bilateral salpingectomy , bilateral oophorectomy ) ; otherwise incapable pregnancy Of childbearing potential practicing reliable method birth control , throughout study 1 week study complete . The method must consistent local regulation regard use birth control method participant participate clinical study : example , establish use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception ; placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) ; doublebarrier method : condom spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ; male partner sterilization ( vasectomized partner sole partner participant ) ; true abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle participant ) A woman childbearing potential must negative serum ( betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ betahCG ] ) test Screening urine pregnancy test Day 1 first treatment period A man sexually active woman childbearing potential vasectomy must agree use barrier method birth control example , either condom spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository partner occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository , men must also donate sperm study 3 month completion study Participant must willing able adhere prohibition restriction specify protocol Participant history current clinically significant medical illness include limited , cardiac arrhythmia cardiac disease ; hematologic disease ; coagulation disorder ( include abnormal bleeding blood dyscrasia ) ; lipid abnormality ; significant pulmonary disease , include bronchospastic respiratory disease ; diabetes mellitus ; hepatic renal insufficiency [ ( creatinine clearance 60 milliliter per minute ( mL/min ) ] ; thyroid disease ; neurologic psychiatric disease ; infection ; illness investigator considers exclude participant could interfere interpretation study result Clinically significant abnormal value hematology , clinical chemistry , urinalysis Screening deem appropriate investigator Clinically significant abnormal physical examination , vital sign 12 lead ECG Screening deem appropriate investigator Use medication treatment would significantly influence exaggerate patch adhesion would alter inflammatory immune response study product [ example , antihistamine , systemic topical corticosteroid , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , cytotoxic drug , immune globulin , Bacillus CalmetteGuerin ( BCG ) , monoclonal antibody , radiation therapy ] . Throughout study , prescription nonprescription medication ( include vitamin herbal supplement ) study drug [ Fentanyl Transdermal Therapeutic System ( TTS ) , Naloxone Naltrexone ] prohibit , except acetaminophen hormonal contraceptive woman participant . The use acetaminophen allow 3 day study drug administration . Throughout study , maximum 3 dos per day 325 milligram ( mg ) acetaminophen , 3 gram ( g ) time confinement dose period allow treatment headache pain History drug alcohol abuse accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( 4th edition ) criterion within 5 year Screening positive test result ( ) alcohol and/or drug abuse ( barbiturate , cannabinoids , alcohol , opiates , cocaine , amphetamine , benzodiazepine , hallucinogen ( phencyclidine , psilocybin , dlysergic acid diethylamide [ LSD ] ) , barbiturates Screening</criteria>
