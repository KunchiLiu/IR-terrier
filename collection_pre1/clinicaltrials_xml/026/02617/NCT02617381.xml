	<brief_summary>`` This validation study questionnaire . This multicenter diagnostic study , assess sensitivity specificity simple structure questionnaire , identify patient require haemostatic investigation , pre-operative patient . This study also allow assessment sensitivity specificity routine care strategy . All patient recruit pre-anaesthesia visit anaesthesiologist , different anaesthetic sector day week , different type surgery represent . Each day ( Monday Friday ) , first 2 eligible patient offer take part study . Routine care strategy modify study protocol . In addition , simple structure questionnaire complete patient research assistant pre-operative consultation As recommended diagnostic study , gold standard ( see secondary endpoint paragraph ) perform consistently patient avoid verification bias . The improvement screen need investigation use questionnaire compare routine care measure count many patient adequately reclassify questionnaire compare routine care strategy , regard gold standard ( use Net Reclassification Index ) .

	<brief_title>Pre-operative Haemorrhagic Risk Screening , Using Standardized Questionnaire Before Scheduled Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>`` Screening need extensive haematological investigation order determine existence inherit acquire haemostatic abnormality pre-anaesthesia visit part routinely use strategy prevent perioperative haemorrhagic complication . In France , screen mainly base basic set haemostatic test : prothrombin time ( PT ) , activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) platelet count ( PC ) . When test abnormal , patient may undergo complete set haemostatic test , need , referred haematologist advice . Nevertheless , publish study point scarce efficacy preoperative PT/aPTT/PC test hemorrhagic risk assessment . Therefore , 2011 several professional society advise AGAINST use strategy advocate replacement structure questionnaire screen need haemostatic investigation ( validate increase risk perioperative haemorrhage ) . Nevertheless , performance screen strategy rely structure questionnaire never study pre-anaesthesia context . This probably explain many anaesthesiologists still continue prescribe PT/aPTT/PC detect haemostatic abnormality n't use questionnaire . Thus , hypothesis validate structured simple questionnaire accurate screening strategy determine patient require haemostatic investigation preoperative setting . One main reason non compliance guidance advise use screen haemostatic test ( PT/aPTT/PC ) identification patient potential haemorrhagic risk probably relate fact alternative strategy propose anaesthesiologists ( use structure questionnaire ) never investigate context pre-anaesthesia visit . Therefore , present project would estimate diagnostic performance ( sensitivity specificity ) simple structured questionnaire identify patient require haemostatic investigation ( i.e . patient haemostatic investigation would conclude increase haemorrhagic risk ) . The innovative approach project relate : ( ) choice simple structure questionnaire , specifically conceive use pre-anaesthesia visit ; ( ii ) study design take account need final user ( anaesthesiologist surgical team ) . To estimate diagnostic accuracy questionnaire pre-anaesthesia visit , identify patient require haemostatic investigation haemorrhagic risk assessment define full haemostatic investigation ( i.e . patient full haemostatic investigation would conclude increase haemorrhagic risk ) - To estimate diagnostic accuracy ( specificity , sensibility likelihood ratio ) current routine care strategy pre-anaesthesia visit ( i.e . structured questionnaire , prescription haematological test sole discretion anaesthesiologist ) identify patient require haemostatic investigation HgR define gold standard ( full haemostatic investigation ) . - To measure improvement identification patient require haemostatic investigation HgR assessment use simple structured questionnaire , compare usual care , pre-operative patient ( i.e . describe many patient adequately reclassify use questionnaire ) . - To describe many patient major peri-operative bleeding event respect answer simple structured questionnaire .
