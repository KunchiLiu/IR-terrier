	<detailed_description>Rocuronium block neuromuscular transmission neuromuscular junction , cause paralysis affect skeletal muscle . There several study report positive relationship muscle mass amount neuromuscular junction . Until , dose rocuronium judge patient 's weight height . However , height weight represent exact muscle mass . The purpose study find relationship muscle mass muscle relaxation time . Measurement muscle mass obtain use bioelectrical impedence analysis .</detailed_description>
