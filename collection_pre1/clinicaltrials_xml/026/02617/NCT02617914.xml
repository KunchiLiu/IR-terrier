	<brief_summary>The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) common condition critical ill patient affect 7.2 people / 100,000 population / year 7 % patient invasive mechanical ventilation 24 hour . ARDS carry high hospital mortality 48 % consumes large amount critical care resource . ARDS patient often present severe hypoxemia refractory conventional treatment thus evaluate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . However , uncertainty regard appropriate indication ECMO clinical evidence ECMO rescue treatment still controversial . In 2012 Grasso colleague therefore present case series influenza A ( H1N1 ) ARDS patient describe use esophageal pressure measurement individualized PEEP titration achieve end expiratory plateau pressure lung ( PPLATL ) 25cm H2O . After perform measurement 14 patient , ventilator setting could adjust half patient increase PEEP result increase oxygenation measure extend criterion extracorporeal support long meet conventional treatment invasive mechanical ventilation could continue . However , uncertainty remain whether result generalizable ARDS cause . In addition , increase PEEP might impact cardiac function might therefore associated clinical important hemodynamic effect patient . The investigator aim evaluate hemodynamic change patient severe ARDS individualized PEEP treatment strategy employ . ARDS define stratify accord Berlin ARDS definition . A naso-gastric probe capable measure esophageal pressure insert directly admission ICU previously describe . Invasive mechanical ventilation oesophageal pressure measurement do use GE Healthcare Carescape R860 ventilator . A pulmonary artery catheter ( Edwards CCOcomb ) insert evaluate hemodynamic parameter cardiac output , pulmonary artery pressure leave atrial pressure . Volumetric parameter measure use tanspulmonary thermodilution device ( Edwards EV1000 ) . Cardiac function address addition use predefined echocardiography protocol .</brief_summary>
