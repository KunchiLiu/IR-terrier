	<brief_summary>Occasionally , doctor need able see whether diaphragm - muscle chest help control breathe - move properly . If diaphragm paralyze move properly , affect person 's breathing . After certain nerve block - part body frozen use local anesthetic - nerve control diaphragm movement anesthetize , cause diaphragm paralysis . Ultrasound use see diaphragm measure movement , easy fast way debatable . The investigator wish compare two ultrasound-based method image diaphragm movement see one offer quick easy way determine diaphragm paralyze .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background rationale The diaphragm muscle help control breathing : upon inhalation , diaphragm contract , help draw air lung . Air exhale diaphragm relaxes . Measurement diaphragmatic movement important tool assess function diaphragm . With introduction ultrasound technology bedside , motion diaphragm lung visualize real time . This afford practitioner ability detect diaphragm paralyze move properly . For example , phrenic nerve , control diaphragm movement , often anesthetize interscalene brachial plexus block . As result , diaphragm block side paralyze , compromise breathing . This serious implication patient already suffer respiratory difficulty . There several previously describe method assess diaphragm movement use ultrasound . The investigator wish compare two method determine one user-friendly offer fast time measure diaphragm movement . The first method rely ability identify image right leave diaphragms acoustic window liver spleen , respectively , record diaphragm movement M-mode . The second method rely ability identify location diaphragm image lung sliding , follow re-orientation ultrasound probe enable measurement change diaphragm thickness respiration . The investigator hypothesize , due obvious visibility structure involve , second method result accurate confirmation diaphragm paralysis . Study objectives The primary objective determine two ultrasound-based method image diaphragm offer fastest easy way confirm diaphragm paralysis . A secondary objective determine inter-rater reliability among two individual use scan method . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize image lung slide ultrasound follow diaphragm thickness measurement easy fast practitioner detect diaphragm motion/paralysis . Study procedures Following informed write consent , eligible patient recruit University Alberta pre-admission clinic ( PAC ) day ward . Once patient arrives block area , study investigator scan patient 's diaphragm side use one two scan method . The scan method use determine randomly ; investigator give sealed envelope contain brief instruction method diaphragm imaging use . The investigator scan one side patient side . The order scan leave participate investigator . A study team member record length time take investigator obtain deem optimal image , save ultrasound machine . Following , regional block administer . Once regional block deem working , second set diaphragm scan do . A study investigator give brief instruction perform scan method , one do pre-block . Again , time take obtain optimal image record , image save ultrasound machine . This end study procedure , patient transfer operating theater .</detailed_description>
