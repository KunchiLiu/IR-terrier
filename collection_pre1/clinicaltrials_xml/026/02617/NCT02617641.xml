	<brief_summary>Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) one lead cause coronary artery disease mortality , among top reason health care utilization Canada . Physical activity counsel core component secondary prevention intervention increase physical activity associate reduced mortality risk , improve quality life , reduce coronary risk factor , reduce health care utilization . Despite health benefit , 40 % 60 % patient ACS event insufficiently active . Web-based intervention offer innovative alternative intervention delivery via Internet secondary prevention . However , paucity randomize controlled trial test , ACS patient , computer-tailored intervention include video within tailor algorithm . The purpose multicenter randomize control trial test web-based intervention , TAVIEenM @ RCHE , use tailored-videos nurse , 'virtual nurse ' , aim increase physical activity walk ACS patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Web-Based Tailored Nursing Intervention Increase Walking Patients After Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After baseline data collect , participant ( N = 148 ) randomize either one two group : 1 ) access 4-week TAVIEenM @ RCHE intervention additional `` booster '' 8 week ( experimental group ) 2 ) access list publicly available website ( control group ) . Participants include report insufficient level physical activity prior hospitalization , serious medical condition impede adherence moderate-intensity physical activity . Data collection occur recruitment ( in-hospital ) , baseline ( home 3 week post-hospital discharge ) , 5 12 week post baseline . The data analysis consistent intention-to-treat principle . Baseline characteristic compare use descriptive statistic identify trend group imbalance . For analysis primary outcome change step per day baseline 12 week , secondary outcome change step per day baseline 5 week , repeat measure ANCOVA model compare adjust difference experimental control group significance 0.05 . For analysis two secondary outcome change energy expenditure walk moderate-intensity physical activity baseline 5 week , baseline 12 week , repeat measure MANCOVA model compare adjust difference experimental control group significance 0.05 .</detailed_description>
