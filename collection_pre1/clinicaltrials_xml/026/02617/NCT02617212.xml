	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether immediate definitive abutment connection dental implant effective prevent marginal bone loss compare conventional treatment late abutment/implant connection , include three disconnection reconnections .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implant Abutment Dis-/Reconnection Peri-Implant Marginal Bone Loss .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study randomize clinical trial participant allocate one two arm accord propose intervention : experimental group , abutments permanently connect immediately implant placement procedure ; control group ( active comparator ) conventional treatment , abutment disconnect reconnected three time . Considering inclusion exclusion criterion related oral systemic health , sample participant select among partially edentulous patient seek dental implant treatment Fortaleza University School Dentistry . The sample size calculate base standard deviation 0.17 mm , significance level 5 % 80 % statistical test power . To detect clinically significant difference 0.2 mm , group compose 11 participant . Therefore , consider 10 % margin possible dropout miss data , study include 24 participant divide two group . Each participant receive one two implant accord his/her need , study may include 24 implant . A single surgeon perform implant surgical procedure order reduce variation inherent clinical experience . After local anesthesia incision top alveolar ridge , bone expose mucoperiosteal flap elevation . The mucosal thickness measure implant site , lingual/palatal flap elevation , periodontal probe . The drilling sequence do accord manufacturer 's recommendation , saline solution irrigation , intermittent movement speed 1200rpm . The implant develop final insertion torque 32Ncm enable abutment connection torque , indicate experimental arm . The implant primary stability also measure resonance frequency analysis ( Osstell ; Osstell AB , Gothenburg , Sweden ) . A minimum 65 ISQ require single-stage surgery . Thus , implant contemplate requirement exclude study receive conventional treatment two-stage surgery necessary . Before finish surgical procedure , volunteer randomly assign one two arm open seal envelope random sequence generate Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , Washington , USA ) . Therefore , surgeon identify volunteer 's arm end drilling , insertion stabilization implant . Each implant allocate control arm ( active comparator ) receive conventional treatment three abutment disconnection reconnections . At experimental arm , implant receive prosthetic abutment definitive way immediately surgical procedure , avoid abutment disconnection . The surgery arm finish suture , drug prescription postoperative recommendation . All implant receive temporary crown three month definitive prosthesis six month surgery . Intraoral radiograph do paralleling technique immediately surgery ( baseline ) 3 , 6 , 12 24 month later . The radiographs dimension correct ImageJ software ( National Institutes Health , Bethesda , Maryland , USA ) implant know dimension reference . Each implant radiograph evaluate previously calibrate examiner minimum 0.8 intra-rater reliability intraclass correlation coefficient . The examiner know arm X-rays belong . Primary secondary outcome data submit normality test compare use statistical test pair unpaired sample .</detailed_description>
