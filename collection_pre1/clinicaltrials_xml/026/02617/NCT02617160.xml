	<brief_summary>Pump therapy gain popularity treatment mode patient type 1 diabetes . Utilizing pump therapy require development application new spectrum theoretical knowledge practical skill patient . Furthermore , occasionally need tailor pump setting , i.e . insulin correction factor , carbohydrate ratio , basal plan insulin activity time , order optimize improve glucose control . These adjustment base collected information include insulin delivery , blood glucose measurement , continuous glucose monitoring data , meal . Analyzing multitude information data overwhelm many patient , caregiver health care provider . Unfortunately , physician need expertise fully fulfill task , , time consume . Thus , summary data insulin dose adjustment suggestion miss . An automated tool pump set adjustment improve glycemic control without escalate burden patient health care system . Such advisor assist professional team routine follow-up patient visit . To address challenge , investigator develop MD-Logic Pump Advisor ( MDPA ) , automatically analyse treatment information , learn patient 's need accordingly suggest adjustment insulin dosing . The MDPA use information gather glucose monitoring , insulin dose meal data daily routine home care . Following 5 minute data collection analysis , algorithm learns suggest pump-setting change optimization glucose control . The objective research project , call MD-Logic Advise4U , test MD-Logic pump advisor clinical study . The study generate data necessary address safety , reliability , efficacy algorithm</brief_summary>
