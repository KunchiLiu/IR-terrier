	<brief_summary>Oligozoospermia , refers low concentration sperm . A low sperm count poor sperm quality cause infertility 20 % couple fertility problem , contributory factor 25 % couple . In majority case , cause find . For mild male infertility , intra uterine insemination ( IUI ) procedure choice pregnancy rate 6.5 % . In IUI , sperm insert use thin , flexible catheter directly woman 's uterus . Azoospermia affect 1 % male population 20 % male infertility situation . Over 50 % azoospermic case due testicular failure , include absence fail production well low production maturation arrest process spermatogenesis . ICSI allow successful fertilization even immature sperm obtain directly testicular tissue . This do TESA ( Testicular sperm aspiration ) TESE ( Testicular sperm extraction ) . In case TESE small strip testicular tissue extract intention find viable sperm cell use IVF ICSI . Men non-obstructive azoospermia 0 3 mature spermatid per seminiferous tubule contrast 17-35 mature spermatid men normal spermatogenesis . TESE success rate approximately 50 % differ accord etiology . Unfortunately , method point sperm may find . TESE accompany pain , tissue loss , reduce success future TESE due tissue scar testosterone deficiency . The complex process spermatogenesis include maturation young spermatid spermatozoas , process take approximately 74 day . During spermatogenesis , spermatogonial stem cell transform spermatid release seminiferous tubule epithelium lumen . Non-motile spermatozoon transport seminifreous tubule epididymis testicular fluid secrete Sertoli cell aid peristaltic contraction . During transport epididymis , sperm cell develop ability progress forward , undergo capacitation attach penetrate egg . The electric charge spermatic cell term zeta potential ( electrokinetic potential ) define electric potential slip plane sperm membrane surroundings . Mature sperm possess electric charge −16 −20 mV . In animal study conduct , positive electrical current low amplitude bellow sensation level situate around scrotum four normospermic one oligospermic male pig . At end research concentration spermatocytes epididymis obtain surgery find 200 1600 percent baseline . Our intention evaluate positive electrical current low amplitude bellow sensation level situate scrotum increase concentration spermatocytes ejaculate . If hypothesis confirm may become method treat male infertility . The period improvement still unclear .</brief_summary>
