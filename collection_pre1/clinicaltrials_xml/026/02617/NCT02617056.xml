	<brief_summary>It generally acknowledge patient dementia best care home . However , outbursts various behavioral disturbance , e.g. , combativeness , appear case often necessitate institutionalization . These outburst often without apparent warning , limit preventive intervention . The measurement electrical activity skin well-studied indicator stress agitation . The investigator propose monitor electrical activity skin patient dementia order determine whether sign agitation may occur outburst . If skin electrical activity give sufficient warning , preventive intervention may try . If successful , ability predict prevent outburst behavioral disturbance allow patient care home long period . It primary aim project determine whether skin electrical activity give warn ; possible preventive measure subject future study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Objective ( ) : The key goal project develop method objectively monitor , ultimately , predict outburst aberrant behavior commonly see among patient variety neuropsychiatric condition : dementia , PTSD , TBI , schizophrenia . This initial study patient dementia . The analytic focus measurement electrodermal activity ( EDA ) , widely-studied physiological recording indicate sympathetic tone ; central hypothesis approach sympathetic tone increase prior outburst , therefore , may allow therapeutic intervention prevent . Alterations sympathetic activity implicate literature four condition . Here , EDA record hold advantage require neither effort communication part subject , noninvasive procedure . These factor make EDA potentially useful clinical assessment arousal among patient dementia , first specific group study protocol . 2 . Research Design : The general design study monitor EDA subject small device worn wrist , ankle arm ; pattern spontaneous EDA assess feature may predict occurrence outburst . In initial study dementia patient , investigator first survey EDA responses commonly use paradigm ( e.g. , visual stimulus , EDA response ) . Currently , little known EDA population , investigator redress ( 1 ) establish behavioral physiological baseline subject study , ( 2 ) determine two class dependent measure cohere , ( 3 ) evaluate whether pattern EDA differ function aberrant behavior often see dementia : wandering , combativeness , `` sundowning '' ( agitation typically develop late day ) . These behavior often group literature term `` disorder arousal '' , clinically well know present sign disorientation case , distress . ( 4 ) Moreover , quantitative assessment EDA change conceivably may reveal pattern may signal onset problem behavior . Each subject serve his/her control , provide within-subject measure EDA signal time correlation aberrant behavior . It worth note key EDA measure subject bias base experimenter rating . Further , aberrant behavior also rat time , use quantitative rating scale . In second class analysis , investigator perform group contrast subject without aberrant behavior , operationally define rating scale , determine patient problem behavior distinctive group respect EDA pattern . All statistical analysis perform anonymized data , blind group membership . 3 . Methodology : EDA measure standard technique subject : electrode may place hand , foot , ankle , wrist , arm accord preference configured measure conductivity potential . In one portion study , wearable device measure EDA use determine whether EDA predict occurrence outburst . In study dementia patient , assessment perform inpatient dementia care facility Bedford VAMC ( GRECC ) . Over two-year period , investigator anticipate enrol 60 subject . Recruitment criterion include toleration EDA record device worn wrist ( similar watch ) ankle . Skin potential , skin conductance , membrane electrical power monitor data record electronically . Data de-identified assign serial subject number patient ; table link number subject 's identity keep secure VA server , allow re-identification data analysis . 4 . Findings : If successful , EDA may predict outburst aberrant behavior enough lead time permit preventive intervention . 5 . Clinical Relationships : The investigator hypothesize : ( ) stable physiologic baseline obtain EDA measure , ( b ) EDA signal alter function aberrant behavior ( `` disorder arousal '' ) within-subject basis , ( c ) group difference emerge sample patient without aberrant behavior . 6 . Impact/Significance : If EDA bear sensitive measure disorder arousal , measure may find application assessment treatment dementia .</detailed_description>
