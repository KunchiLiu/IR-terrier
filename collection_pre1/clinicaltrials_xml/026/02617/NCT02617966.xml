	<brief_summary>Background : Retinal disease cause loss rod cone photoreceptors . Symptoms include vision loss night blindness . Researchers want learn rod cone function healthy people people retinal disease . They want know well person see dark test severity retinal disease . Objectives : To find well person see dark test severity retinal disease . To find help detect retinal disease track change . Eligibility : People age 5 older : Retinal disease OR 20/20 vision well without correction least one eye Design : Participants screen medical eye history eye exam . Those retinal disease also : Eye imaging : Drops dilate eye picture take . Visual field testing : Participants look bowl press button see light . Electroretinogram ( ERG ) : An electrode tap forehead . Participants sit dark eye patch 30 minute . Then get numb drop contact lens . Participants watch light retina signal record . Visit 1 3 8 hour . Participants 6 visit 6 12 month . Visits include : Eye exam image Time course dark adaptation : Participants view background light 5 minute push button see color light . Dark adapt sensitivity : Participants sit dark 45 minute . They push button see color light . For participant retinal disease , ERG visual field test</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective protocol investigate local change rod cone photoreceptor function across retina healthy volunteer participant retinal disease . Study Population : Up 80 healthy volunteer 250 participant , age 5 old , retinal disease . Design : This single-center , observational , case-control study comprise three related aim make use recently release commercial Dark Adapted Chromatic ( DAC ) perimeter . For aim 1 normal range establish dark-adapted retinal sensitivity blue red stimulus DAC perimeter . For aim 2 , normal range establish describe kinetics dark adaptation follow bleach retinal rhodopsin DAC perimeter . For aim 3 , local change rod cone photoreceptor function across retina participant retinal disease examine measurement kinetics dark adaptation and/or dark-adapted retinal sensitivity DAC blue red stimulus . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome study establish normal range kinetics dark adaptation ( time ) dark adapt retinal sensitivity ( dB ) Medmont DAC blue red stimulus . The secondary outcome examine change kinetics dark adaptation dark adapt retinal sensitivity participant retinal disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant must 5 year age old . Participant ( legal guardian ) must understand sign protocol inform consent document . Participant must able cooperate testing require study . For Participants retinal disease : Participant must retinal disease , define evidence loss retinal dysfunction and/or degeneration establish standard clinical method include perimetry , ERG imaging . Participant must measurable visual acuity . For Healthy Volunteers : Participant must visual acuity 20/20 good , without correction ( e.g. , glass contact lens ) least one eye . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant change preretinal medium sufficient obscure view retina .</criteria>
