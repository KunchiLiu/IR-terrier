	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics AZD1775 Plus MEDI4736 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , multi-center , dose-escalation study ass safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics oral therapy AZD1775 combine fixed-dose MEDI4736 . Immunogenicity , pharmacodynamics , preliminary anti-tumour activity patient refractory solid tumour also investigate . In initial design study novel combination AZD1775 MEDI4736 test . The start dose AZD1775 125 mg BID , 5 day 9 day 14-day cycle . This designated Schedule A . This dose well tolerate . Two six patient experience dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . The protocol amend include two additional dosing schedule , designate Schedules B C. In Schedule B patient receive MEDI4736 Day 1 , AZD1775 Day 15-17 Day 22-24 28-day cycle . In Schedule C , patient receive MEDI4736 Day 1 , AZD1775 Day 8-10 , Day 15-17 Day 22-24 28-day cycle . AZD1775 dose maximum 6 day ( Schedule B ) 9 day ( Schedule C ) 28-day cycle . In Schedule B C , dexamethasone administer anti-emetic first day AZD1775 consecutive dosing day block AZD1775 administer least 1 week MEDI4736 administration . Three six patient enrol dose level 1 Schedule B evaluate safety 28 day cycle prior open Schedule C dose level 1 enrolment . Following safety evaluation three six patient Schedule C dose level 1 , decision make Safety Review Team ( SRT ) move forward one schedule dose escalation . Dose escalation continue identification Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) . Once MTD determine cohort expand total 18 patient collect safety data preliminary assessment efficacy . Alternative dose levels/cohorts and/or schedule may explore emerge data suggest would appropriate . The first day Cycle 1 Schedules B C precede seven day lead-in AZD1775 monotherapy enable serial sample assessment pharmacokinetic parameter .</detailed_description>
