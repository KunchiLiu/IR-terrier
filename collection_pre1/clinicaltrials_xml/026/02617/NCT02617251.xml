	<brief_summary>Many study show deprived patient consume healthcare resource non-deprived patient , particular term increase length stay ( LOS ) readmission rate , impact hospital efficiency healthcare system whole . There many type indicator available assess deprivation hospital set French decision maker currently use reliance public aid allocate additional funding hospital , base percentage deprive patient admit . However limit method : assess one dimension deprivation , target population often know existence aid , clear threshold effect . An alternative solution use ecological deprivation index obtain aggregate different variable measure specific time place , i.e . patient 's place residence time care . One index , FDep , develop specifically France , although others Carstairs index European deprivation index also exist . The primary objective study study association deprivation , measure FDep , hospital care efficiency paediatric neonatology patient , measure difference patient LOS national average LOS diagnosis-related group , DRG ) . The secondary objective carry budget impact analysis impact deprivation hospital paediatric neonatology ward , study association deprivation readmission 15 day , study relation FDep currently use deprivation indicator , ass add value FDep compare indicator whether use routine practice . In order , exhaustive retrospective study use French hospital claim database carried year 2012-2014 . Deprivation index calculate base patient ' postcode . The primary endpoint calculate use national LOS present French national cost study . Similarly , budget impact look difference production cost derive national cost study adjust LOS statutory health insurance 's tariff , allow u ass whether hospital stay associate gain , loss budget-neutral hospital . Readmissions 15 day identify record linkage . Descriptive analysis summarise hospital patient characteristic . Uni- bivariate analysis carry focus variable interest ( e.g . average deprivation index legal status hospital , mean LOS depend number paediatric bed etc. ) . The deprivation index divide quantiles norm endpoint assess quantiles . An ANOVA ( Kruskal-Wallis test ANOVA hypotheses meet ) test whether result differ quantile . For readmission rate , ChiÂ² test performed . In order study association deprivation endpoint , investigator model endpoint use main explanatory variable deprivation index . Three main type explanatory variable add model : patient characteristic ( age , sex , severity level etc . ) , hospital characteristic ( legal status , size , number full-time equivalent etc . ) environment/context characteristic ( number paediatricians 1,000 inhabitant , rural vs. urban area etc. ) . In order ass add benefit use deprivation index vs. current indicator , sub-cohort construct Paris teach hospital ( AP-HP ) unfortunately , whether patient receives public aid present hospital claim database available local level . The investigator look distribution patient public aid quantile deprivation index run previous model use two type indicator one compare statistical performance pair model .</brief_summary>
