	<brief_title>Partial Breast Irradiation Low-risk Ductal Carcinoma In Situ After Breast-conserving Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized clinical trial demonstrate recurrence DCIS low recurrence occur around tumor bed . Besides , cosmetic outcome report well partial breast irradiation group compare whole breast irradiation group . However , whether partial breast irradiation safety DCIS still unknown . The purpose study evaluate feasibility safety partial breast irradiation low risk DCIS breast-conserving surgery .</detailed_description>
