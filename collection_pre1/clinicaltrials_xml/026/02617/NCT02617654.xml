	<brief_summary>Recent study show many Type 1 diabetes patient remain endogenous insulin production , albeit low level . Finding means increase production would tremendous interest , since residual C-peptide concentration &gt; 0.1 nmol/l previously show markedly low HbA1c , decrease blood glucose fluctuation diminish risk ketoacidosis . It also substantially reduce risk severe hypoglycemic event late complication . Liraglutide may incretin effect directly potentiate beta-cell function , also hold potential mitogenic cell . The hypothesis present trial treatment liraglutide direct effect beta-cell function , less immediately observe , also progressively improve C-peptide concentration time .</brief_summary>
