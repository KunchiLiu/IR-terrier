	<brief_summary>The Greulich Pyle technique ( G &amp; P ) commonly use ass bone age child , particularly context suspect skeletal dysplasia . However show applicable child Asian African ethnicity may applicable United Kingdom ( UK ) Caucasian child , relatively mature large child mid 1930 's ( G &amp; P develop ) . It generally agree updated standard require rapid reliable bone age assessment . The development standard require irradiation normal child . To ethically , radiation exposure must keep low possible . Two recent study suggest bone age assessment reliably achieve dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan . As far investigator aware , Tanner &amp; Whitehouse ( TW3 ) method , prefer ( e.g . endocrinologist nutritionist ) , assess dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan - although main focus study , popularity amongst certain specialty , investigator shall assess TW3 method also . Modern techniques available textbook , also available digital ( on-line ) format possible integrated hospital PACS system . The investigator believe team require experience expertise successfully carry project . Before conduct require large cross-sectional study , investigator must first confirm DXA fact replace radiograph bone age assessment child ; objective current study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This small prospective feasibility study perform 12-month period . Children book left hand radiograph bone age assessment ( either isolation part dysplasia skeletal survey ) recruit . This require purposive sample 2 male 2 female follow 5 age group ( &lt; 5 ; 5 7 ; 8 10 ; 11 13 ; 14 16 year ) . There therefore total 20 child ( 10 male ) . Because aim study compare result DXA radiographs correspond child , ethnicity individual child issue ; word investigator assess reliability DXA reliability G &amp; P TW3 . Relevant clinician identify patient appropriate clinic Sheffield Children 's Hospital . Only patient leave hand radiograph bone age assessment basis clinical need approach . Age appropriate information sheet give , study briefly discuss . When arrive Radiology Department leave hand radiograph , appropriately certify radiographer seek inform consent provide left hand radiograph actually perform , also DXA leave hand 6 year old ask complete brief questionnaire . Researcher 1 anonymise hand radiograph DXA scan , correspond patient image identifiable . Researcher 1 also document patient age sex , ethnicity body weight height ( clinical information require purpose feasibility study ) . Researchers 2 , 3 4 independently assess image use G &amp; P TW3 . All observer interpret random selection half image ( independently ) second occasion least 2 month first ; occasion Images interpret random varied order . Images read two batch 10 radiograph 10 ( non-corresponding ) DXA scan first read 5 radiograph 5 ( non-corresponding ) DXA scan second read . Statistical analysis largely irrelevant small feasibility study . The investigator ' main aim ass whether G &amp; P TW3 reliably assess hand DXA image . The concordance 1 ) independent reading three observer radiographs DXA ( i.e . compare modality ) 2 ) individual observer occasion ( i.e . compare observer reliability modality ) evaluate use interclass intraclass correlation coefficient . The investigator calculate mean standard deviation difference DXA radiograph observer . Statistical analysis perform use Statistical Package Social Sciences , version 21 Mac ( SPSS , Chicago , IL ) .</detailed_description>
