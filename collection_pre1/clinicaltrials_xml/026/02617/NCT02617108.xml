	<brief_summary>Patients want go TCRS randomly divide 2 group . In Group 1 ( 100 patient ) , Foley catheter balloon inflate 4 ml normal saline solution place uterine cavity end operation five day . In Group 2 ( 110 patient ) , woman receive treatment ( comparison group ) . All subject underwent two hysteroscopy , one three month initial surgery . At second third look hysteroscopy , incidence intra-uterine adhesion analyze .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Foley Balloon Therapy Preventing Post-operative Adhesion Following Transection Uterine Septum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The uterine septum ( US ) common congenital uterine malformation , account 75 % Mullerian anomaly . Transcervical resection septum ( TCRS ) show several cohort study improve outcome , although evidence prospectively conduct randomized trial lacking . TCRS generally consider safe concern may complicate post-operative formation intrauterine adhesion . Some investigator therefore recommend use postoperative adjuvant therapy view prevent adhesion formation , case hysteroscopic surgery Asherman syndrome . The adjuvant measure propose include postoperative estrogen therapy , placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) Foley catheter uterine cavity . Unlike case Asherman syndrome various adjuvant therapy often use appear benefit , uncertain adjuvant measure benefit necessary case TCRS . In study , investigator compare postoperative adhesion formation rate receive Foley catheter therapy receive therapy determine usefulness Foley catheter therapy reduce postoperative adhesion formation .</detailed_description>
