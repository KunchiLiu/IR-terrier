	<detailed_description>Removal colonic polyp reduces colon cancer although polyp find small , removal large polyp safely effectively remove wide field EMR . Residual polyp tissue find follow colonoscopy approximately 15 % case however remain focus attempt improve EMR efficacy . All patient undergo surveillance colonoscopy EMR Westmead Hospital Endoscopy unit step assessment therapy scar record . Data enter large prospective audit database also analyse separately . Data store coded format . The individual step outcome scar interrogation therapy also assess analyse . It expect result help guide optimal approach assessment confirm efficacy therapy recurrence aid endoscopic approach large colonic polyp .</detailed_description>
