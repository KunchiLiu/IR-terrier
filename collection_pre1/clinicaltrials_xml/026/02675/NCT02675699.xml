	<brief_title>The Optimising Family Engagement HENRY ( OFTEN ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Rising rate obesity preschool child alarm emphasise need evidence-based approach prevent obesity , successfully implemented community . Although robust , theory-based prevention programme exist , often challenge get parent attend adopt positive behaviour change family . AIM : To evaluate effectiveness recently develop 'Optimisation intervention ' optimise parent engagement community base obesity prevention programme 'HENRY ' , use routinely collect process data exist site commission deliver HENRY UK DESIGN : Multi-centre , cluster randomise control trial . As research judge ability local authority Centres optimise implementation HENRY , cluster randomise design , choose local authority unit randomisation . Local authority randomise 1:1 allocation ratio ( HENRY+ Optimisation Intervention ; HENRY alone control ) statistician Leeds CTRU , use minimisation algorithm random element , stratify baseline level implementation ( proportion Centres meet none 2 primary outcome implementation criteria/ meeting 1 2 criterion ) ) size local authority ( number Children 's Centres ( &lt; 10/ ≥10 ) ) area deprivation ( ≤10 % / &gt; 10 % rank within Index Multiple Deprivation Lower Layer Super Output Area ) . Consent participate sought cluster level ( local authority ) Centres within local authority use opt-out approach . CONTROL ARM : HENRY deliver standard . HENRY ( Health , Exercise , Nutrition Really Young ) 8-week programme deliver Children 's Centres ( CCs ) , aim provide parent skills knowledge support healthy lifestyle preschool child family . It set 2006 Department Health support aim reverse rise trend school entry age obesity . HENRY currently deliver 32 local area across England Wales train health community practitioner . ACTIVE ARM : HENRY standard plus optimisation intervention enhance parent engagement ( recruitment attendance ) 8 week programme . A tailored 'Optimisation ' intervention develop NIHR fund ( CDF 2014-07-052 ) support local authority Children 's Centres promote HENRY implementation , base observation positive deviant , interview Children Centre staff stakeholder , input parent . The result optimisation package multi-component intervention implement multi-levels ( local authority , Centres , parent ) . Precise detail currently disclose risk contamination . ANALYSIS : Primary outcome analysis intention-to treat Population use 3-level hierarchical model , course ( participant ) nest within CCs within LA , adjust randomization minimisation variable . Differences parent engagement , correspond 95 % CI , p-values ICCs report .</detailed_description>
