	<brief_title>Habitual Physical Activity Sedentary Behavior Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study 1. describe habitual physical activity sedentary behaviour pattern knee osteoarthritis patient schedule total knee arthroplasty , 2. investigate effect unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty objectively subjectively measured physical activity , sedentary behaviour health outcome knee OA patient 3. compare subjective measure functional ability sedentary behaviour ( questionnaire ) objective measure habitual physical activity sedentary behaviour ( accelerometry ) total knee arthroplasty . Study design : This longitudinal follow-up study cohort participant diagnose knee osteoarthritis undergoing total knee arthroplasty . After enrolment study , baseline assessment do prior total knee arthroplasty . After total knee arthroplasty , participant followed-up assessment do baseline also do 6 week , 3 6 month post-operatively . Habitual physical activity sedentary behaviour measure use accelerometry ( Actigraph GTX3+ ActivPal monitor ) specific time points.The ActiGraph wear participant 24 hours/day seven day assessment time point . It attach elastic nylon strap participant wear belt around waist side right/left hip ( depend knee operate ) . Thus , ActiGraph wear side leave hip total knee arthroplasty leave knee vice versa . Participants ask remove ActiGraph showering , bath swimming . After seven day accelerometer wear , accelerometer collect next possible visit hospital arrangement make collection participant location convenient . An ActivPAL tap thigh patient waterproof tap patient ask keep ActivPAL amount time ActiGraph . The ActivPAL cover waterproof tap therefore , need remove ActivPAL showering , bath swimming . The ActivPAL collect time ActiGraph . In addition , general health , functional ability , generic quality life sleep pain questionnaire conduct time point participant . Study Site : The study conduct Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital Johannesburg , South Africa . It accredit central hospital 1088 bed serve patient across Gauteng neighbour province . The hospital situate Parktown also , serve main teach hospital University Witwatersrand , Faculty Health Sciences . Study participant recruit Division Orthopaedics hospital . This hospital chosen : ( 1 ) tertiary hospital run several specialist clinic include Orthopaedic Division total knee arthroplasty perform ( 2 ) collaboration Academic staff Faculty Health Sciences University Witwatersrand hospital Staff teach research facilitate accessibility patient . Sample Size Determination : Based anticipate 2 % decrease amount time spend sedentary behaviour per day ( , average 16 hour day , equate 20 minute reduction ) , sample size calculation show total sample 107 participant require study detect significant effect knee arthroplasty sedentary behaviour power 80 % . The effect total knee arthroplasty change habitual physical activity sedentary behaviour assess three timepoints ( baseline , six week three six month ) .</detailed_description>
