	<brief_title>Vaccine Efficacy Diabetic Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our goal determine individual 's level inflammation determine response vaccination . The age process certain disease , like type-2 diabetes , characterize chronic inflammatory condition . These individual high rate influenza disease health care cost ; hence , yearly vaccination recommend . There paucity information compare vaccination high-risk group identify biomarkers predict vaccine efficacy . The investigator hypothesize elderly diabetic patient reduced response seasonal influenza vaccination inversely proportional level chronic inflammation . In pilot proposal , investigator examine adult elderly diabetic non-diabetic adult marker inflammation vaccine efficacy influenza vaccination . These study help understand chronic inflammatory disease impact immunologic function future research mitigation strategy .</detailed_description>

Group 2 : They ≥65 year age , medically stable ambulatory ; active systemic serious concurrent illness ; diabetes . Group 3 : If 1864 year age , currently diabetic , meet criterion list diabetic subject Group 1 , exception prediagnosed type2 diabetes mellitus ( e.g. , history hemoglobin A1C HbA1C score &gt; 6.5 % ) . NOTE : Current diabetes define patient report physician diagnosis . Subjects history diabetes resolve long require therapy consider current diabetes , e.g , woman history gestational diabetes , steroidinduced medicationinduced . Group 4 : If ≥65 year age , currently diabetic , meet criterion list nondiabetic subject Group 2 , exception prediagnosed type2 diabetes mellitus ( e.g. , history hemoglobin A1C HbA1C score &gt; 6.5 % ) . Year 2 Subjects exclude follow : history know suspected impairment immunologic function , include clinically significant liver disease , arthritis , moderate severe renal ( kidney ) disease , HIV , ongoing infection history bleed disorder receive anticoagulant within last 3 week history heart failure history receive immunosuppressive therapy within last 6 month history receive longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy 2 consecutive week within 3 month history receive blood bloodderived product within last 3 month daily aspirin intake &gt; 325mg pregnant There inclusion/exclusion criterion base race .
