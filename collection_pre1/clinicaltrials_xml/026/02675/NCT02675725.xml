	<brief_title>Kinetics Sublingual Microcirculation During Fluid Bolus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluid therapy one cornerstone treatment organ failure . The investigator assume fluid bolus increase delivery oxygen cell resolve shock . The evaluation treatment do clinical sign organ perfusion en ( little use ) invasive hemodynamic monitoring . Previous research suggest in-vivo microscopy microcirculation importance determine type shock reaction treatment tissue level . Evaluation microcirculation do measuring red blood cell velocity three different site sublingual region . This necessary order take heterogeneity account , hard fix camera one spot observation period . The purpose study asses kinetics sublingual microcirculation one place fluid bolus . The great advantage recording fluid therapy compare pair data , wherein subject control . By choose time interval long enough observation change , short enough manual fixing camera , seem possible serve purpose ( 15-30 minute ) . This seem crucial red blood cell flow capillary density measure . It expect fluid therapy normalization red blood cell flow velocity microcirculation result decrease capillary density formation edema tissue . This consider tipping potentially beneficial deleterious effect fluid therapy . After cardiac surgery patient transfer ICU stabilisation . Within specific indication patient receive fluid bolus , indication hypotension , hyperlactataemia , tachycardia decrease urine production . The fluid bolus 250 ml crystalloids 15 minute . The investigator observe sublingual microcirculation fluid bolus . To ass red blood cell velocity capillary vessel density one spot fluid bolus .</detailed_description>
