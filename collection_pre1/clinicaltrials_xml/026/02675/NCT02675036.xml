	<brief_title>Interceptive Study Ectopic Eruption Permanent Maxillary Canine Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study objective : 1 . Evaluate effectiveness concomitant extraction maxillary deciduous canine maxillary deciduous first molar compare extraction deciduous maxillary canine interceptive measure improve eruption path ectopic maxillary canine . 2 . Evaluate whether difference use analgesic , pain discomfort two treatment group 1 . Procedure : After informed consent patient randomly assign one two group . Group1 : Extraction deciduous canine Group 2 : Extraction deciduous canine deciduous first molar Randomization The block randomization method use . Block size randomly vary 2 , 4 , 6 8 . Blocks generate free software http : //www.randomization.com . Allocation concealment do enclose assignment sequentially numbered envelope . Envelopes torn open use . The randomization process do staff member TkNN involve trial . Prior extraction topical anesthetic give two minute , buccal palatal infiltration local anesthetic ( 1,8 ml dose , 20mg/ml lidocain 12,5 g/ml epinephrine ) . Patients parent give oral postoperative information , include recommendation use non-prescription analgesic discretion . Clinical Radiographic control evaluation : Patients control clinically radiographically ( DPT ) 6 12 month . If improvement detectable 12 month , alternative treatment suggest ( surgical exposure , fix orthodontic appliance , extraction ) . All case need alternative approach follow tooth erupt mouth . Sector , alpha angle d-distance measure DPT-images Dental anxiety Before extraction perform patient answer modify dental anxiety scale ( MDAS ) . Pain discomfort When patient perform extraction receive two questionnaire , regard pain discomfort use analgesic , fulfill home return mail . The first part shall answer first even extraction perform second part answer one week post extraction .</detailed_description>
