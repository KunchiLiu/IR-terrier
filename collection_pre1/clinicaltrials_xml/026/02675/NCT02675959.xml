	<criteria>Patients must demonstrate one follow Sickle Cell Disease Complications ( patient Cohort 2 meet criterion section 4.4 instead ) Clinically significant neurologic event ( stroke ) neurologic deficit last &gt; 24 hour accompany infarct cerebral MRI Minimum two episode acute chest syndrome ( defined new pulmonary alveolar consolidation involve least one complete lung segment associate acute symptom include fever &gt; 38.5 , chest pain , tachypnea , intercostal retraction , nasal flaring , use accessory muscle respiration , wheeze , rale , cough attributable asthma bronchiolitis ) precede two year period prior enrollment fail , noncompliant decline hydroxyurea treatment , prior chronic RBC transfusion therapy , exchange transfusion erythrocyte pheresis . The acute chest syndrome event occur despite adequate supportive care measure ( i.e . despite use supportive care intervention include asthma therapy and/or hydroxyurea ; patient decline hydroxyurea noncompliant therapy eligible meet pulmonary criterion define inclusion ) . Recurrent painful event ( least 3 2 year prior enrollment prior chronic chronic RBC transfusion therapy , exchange transfusion erythrocyte pheresis ) . Pain occurred typical site associate vasoocclusive painful event explain cause sickle cell disease . Pain last least 24 hour require parenteral narcotic treatment , equianalgesic dose oral narcotic parenteral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug . These painful event may treat setting ; however , event , include event manage home , consider eligibility documentation event clinical record may review investigator . Abnormal TCD study require start chronic transfusion therapy and/or exchange transfusion . At least one silent infarct lesion MRI scan head . An infarctlike lesion define MRI signal abnormality least 3 mm one dimension visible two plane fluidattenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) T2weighted image , determine neuroradiologist.207 = OR Cohort # 2 ONLY 98 : Patient must 21 34.99 year age , patient must demonstrate least two follow : WBC &gt; 13,500 cells/microliter baseline acutely ill ( two separate occasion ) &gt; 2 week VOC event hospitalization . Tricuspid Regurgitant Jet Velocity ( TRV ) &gt; 3.0 m/s Requiring Chronic Monthly Transfusions ( &gt; 12 transfusion 12 month ) History sepsis Nterminal probrain natriuretic peptide ( NTproBNP ) &gt; 160 ng/L clinical baseline acutely ill hospitalize . Females pregnant breastfeeding eligible SCD Patients document uncontrolled infection time study entry eligible . SCD patient unaffected HLA match family donor willing proceed donation eligible study . Karnofsky Lansky ( age appropriate ) Performance Score &lt; 50 % ( hemiplegia alone secondary previous stroke exclusion ) Demonstrated lack compliance medical care . Patients clinically significant fibrosis cirrhosis liver eligible . Patients previously receive HSCT eligible . Patients contraindication use defibrotide</criteria>
