	<detailed_description>This study prospective , multi-center , randomize control study delay start arm , conducted common implant protocol . Up 40 study subject implant six center Europe . Subjects evaluate baseline , implant , post-op ( randomize ) 1- , 2- , 3 , - 4- 6-months post-implant . Baseline data include collection demographic medical history , completion physical exam , Functional Tongue Exam ( FTE ) , subject quality life ( QoL ) questionnaires ( Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire ( FOSQ ) Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) ) . Adverse event data collect time baseline test 6-month study follow-up . Implant eligibility assessment include home sleep testing ( HST ) , surgical consultation drug induce sedate endoscopy ( DISE ) determine subject qualified candidate implant . Subjects meet baseline pre-screening requirement implant Inspire system . Intra- post- operative procedure data collect . Subjects see post-operative check one week implant . During visit , subject randomized 1:1 ACTIVE group DELAY group . However , Inspire system activate ( turn `` '' ) first month post-implant allow post-surgical healing . Only subject randomized ACTIVE group return 1-month follow-up visit time device activate ( turn `` '' ) . The subject provide patient remote instruct use . These ACTIVE arm subject instruct use Inspire system nightly basis return 2-month visit in-laboratory sleep study complete device titration . All subject ( ACTIVE DELAY ) return 3-month visit complete HST ( DELAY subject ' therapy remain HST ) . In addition , QoL patient satisfaction survey , Functional Tongue Exam ( FTE ) , general health assessment , include adverse event review , collect . Subjects DELAY arm therapy activate end 3 month visit , return 4-month visit in-laboratory sleep study complete device titration . All subject return 6-month final visit two-night HST complete . In addition , QoL patient satisfaction survey , physical exam FTE data collect ; device check complete well adverse event review . Therapy usage device adjustment data , well subject satisfaction therapy survey , collect additional analysis . Safety data collect throughout study .</detailed_description>
