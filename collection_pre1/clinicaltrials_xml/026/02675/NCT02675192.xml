	<detailed_description>Aging affect almost tissue physiological function , skeletal muscle affect organ . The progressive decline weight muscular function link age contributes lack autonomy dependence , also increase mortality risk . Sarcopenia also prevalent condition , detect 13-24 % 60 year old , 50 % 80 year old . However , strong inter-individual variation prevalence sarcopenia exist . Some elderly ( 60 year old ) reveal biological age 80 year old , whereas 60 year old people reveal biological age 60 year old . The key issue understand biological age skeletal muscle different people . Previous sarcopenia study Humans really focus chronological aging , base comparison young old people . No study consider inter-individual modification ( biological age ) sarcopenia . Furthermore , study associate study `` omic '' , histological , epigenetic data , obtain integrated point view Human Sarcopenia . In study , mechanism involve biological age skeletal muscle age people ( chronological age ) specify .</detailed_description>
