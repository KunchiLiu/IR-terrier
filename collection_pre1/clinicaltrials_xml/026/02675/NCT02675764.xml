	<brief_title>Sensory Stimulation Enhance Hand Function Post Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke survivor suffer persistent hand impairment diminishes functional ability independence , despite multiple course rehabilitation . Sensory stimulation prime central excitability increase therapy outcome . The investigator develop new sensory stimulation technique hand , use imperceptible vibration apply wrist skin . Wearable device vibrate function low cost easily adopt rehabilitation purpose impact wide range patient sensorimotor impairment . Despite potential clinical benefit easy adoption high impact , knowledge long-term efficacy new sensory stimulation technique underlie mechanism limit . The objective pilot project assess impact novel sensory stimulation technique investigator develop enhance outcomes 2-week hand therapy well central nervous system responsiveness chronic stroke survivor . This impact assess double-blind stratify randomize control trial . The hypothesis ( ) improvement hand function great experimental group receive wrist subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation therapy compare control group wear device vibration ( placebo ) . ( b ) Improvement hand function associate neurophysiologic measure central nervous system responsiveness . Clinical neurophysiologic evaluation perform , immediately , 2 week 2 week standardize hand therapy program subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation wrist vs. sham . The investigator preliminary study demonstrate acute effect remote subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation immediately improve clinical sensory motor function hand well cortical excitability healthy young adult chronic stroke survivor single-session study . The expected outcome demonstration subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation wrist enhances hand function , immediately ( preliminary study ) also complement therapy chronic stroke survivor . This project also provide preliminary insight regard plasticity occur hand therapy augment subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation . This research positive impact lead portable sensorimotor orthosis worn wrist improve hand function patient sensorimotor deficit , thus improve quality life .</detailed_description>
