It also result stop delay treatment.Radiation therapy chest use late stage lung cancer , often lead inflammation esophagus . The inflammation expect occur 75 % patient , usually begin within week start radiation therapy . The esophagitis cause pain difficulty eating . The endocannabinoid system prominent gastrointestinal system , cannabis show greatly inhibit inflammation . The compound ( − ) -trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ-9-THC ) effect reduce inflammation pain . Cannabidiol component cannabis produce subjective intoxicating effect , also prominent anti-inflammatory property . The goal study perform double-blind , placebo-controlled study investigate efficacy cannabis , compare placebo , participant undergo RT ( Radiation Therapy ) lung cancer . Cannabis high concentration cannabidiol use , cannabinoid change perception produce intoxication , low Δ-9-THC . In way , hope maximize benefit cannabis , lower possible side effect cannabis medically ill participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Outline Patients refer study physician , patient medically clear participation . The patient undergo additional screening study . A study physician review study procedures potential participant , include potential side effect . Patients show facility inform monitored time . Patients randomize use randomization assign one two group : cannabis ( 15.76 % CBD ; 3.11 % Δ-9 -THC ) v `` placebo '' cannabis ( 0.0 % CBD/ 0.01 % Δ-9-THC ) . Participants visit Marijuana Research Laboratory , 3-5 day week 6 week administer 1-2 cannabis cigarette course 2-3 hour session . Two cannabis condition test : Placebo ( 0.01 % THC ; 0.00 % CBD ) CBD : THC ( 15.76 % CBD ; 3.11 % THC ) provide National Institute Drug Abuse . Participants undergo baseline measurement mood , physical symptom give 2 NIDA ( National Institute Drug Abuse ) cannabis cigarette , consume smoke vaporizer ventilate room . After 90 minute cannabis availability end , participant ask remain laboratory additional 45 minute allow effect cannabis wear . Participants undergo baseline measurement mood , physical symptom give equivalent 2 NIDA cannabis cigarette . Cardiovascular subjective effect measure mood , abuse liability drug tolerability collect baseline , end 90 minute cannabis availability end session . Detailed measure food intake ( caloric content , macronutrient intake ) record begin immediately cannabis administration duration session . In addition visual analog scale , participant ask complete measure mood cannabis effect screen , , session . Participants assessed end session experience clinician . Opioid use : Participants ask provide number opioid medication take follow : 1 ) baseline ( week prior start session ) ; 2 ) session , participant ask opioid use since previous session . The amount opioids use converted oral morphine equivalent tally day . Food intake : Participants ask complete daily food diary duration study . Detailed measure food intake ( caloric content , macronutrient intake ) also record cannabis session . Participants also weigh weekly . PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scan : As part clinical care , patient receive PET/CT scan use radiotracer [ 18F ] FDG low dose CT attenuation correction anatomic localization . This data request PET center , participant consent , order ass extent esophagitis two group .</detailed_description>
