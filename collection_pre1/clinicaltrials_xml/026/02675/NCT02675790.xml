	<brief_title>Moderate Dose Hydroxyurea Secondary Stroke Prevention Children With Sickle Cell Disease Sub-Saharan Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sub-Saharan Africans disproportionately affect sickle cell disease ( SCD ) . In populous country sub-Saharan Africa , Nigeria , 150,000 child severe form SCD , sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) , bear per year compare 1,100 birth United States . In Nigeria , every birth year cohort child SCA follow 18th birthday premature death , least 15,000 overt stroke . The prevalence stroke among child SCA , particularly low-income country , associate increased rate morbidity premature death . If untreated , 50 % child first overt stroke recurrent stroke within two year event . Regular blood transfusion standard therapy secondary stroke prevention high stroke risk population . However , monthly blood transfusion therapy feasible option child SCA sub-Saharan Africa several reason , include high cost monthly transfusion limit blood supply . Preliminary data observational study suggest hydroxyurea ( HU ) therapy may effective alternative strategy secondary stroke prevention child SCA . In sub-Saharan Africa , critical unanswered question appropriate HU dose secondary stroke prevention maximize therapeutic benefit minimize toxicity child . In preparation application , last 9 month , achieve follow milestone SPIN trial ( NCT01801423 ; NIH/NINDS Grant number 1R21NS080639-01 ) : 1 ) demonstrate feasibility HU therapy primary stroke prevention Africa , 92 % eligible participant enrol ; 2 ) show favorable data moderate dose HU therapy ( 20 mg/kg/day ) safe ; 3 ) demonstrate HU therapy may effective primary stroke prevention ( 3 month start HU therapy , two-thirds child SPIN Trial ( n=25 ) baseline elevate transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) measurement decrease TCD value normal level ) ; 4 ) demonstrate short-term safety HU therapy , deaths increase hospitalization compare prospectively followed comparison group ( n=210 ) 7 death high rate all-cause hospitalization ; 5 ) reveal good adherence HU therapy base biological correlate , mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) , validate Morisky Medication Adherence Scale ; 6 ) conduct one-month intensive clinical research training Vanderbilt University , pair ongoing mentor one year multi-disciplinary team Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital ( AKTH ) affiliate satellite clinic , Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital ( MMSH ) locate Kano , Nigeria . Our result date indicate child develop stroke HU therapy , rate adverse event low comparison group normal TCD measurement baseline follow period time ( median 25 month ) . In SPIN trial , treatment comparison group follow 3 year . Based encouraging early result primary stroke prevention SPIN Trial among child SCA Kano , Nigeria , propose definitive partial phase III trial study team , wherein test hypothesis moderate dose HU therapy ( 20 mg/kg/day ) result 80 % relative risk reduction compare low dose HU therapy ( 10 mg/kg/day ) secondary stroke prevention among child 1 - 18 year age SCA acute overt stroke . The aims two center randomize partial double-blind Phase III clinical trial : 1 ) ass efficacy moderate dose HU therapy secondary stroke prevention compare low dose HU therapy among child SCA ; 2 ) determine whether moderate HU therapy decrease rate all-cause hospitalization compare low dose HU therapy ; 3 ) ass prevalence stroke incidence recurrent stroke among individual SCD age 1 - 18 active study site January 1 , 2014 December 31 , 2016 . We randomly allocate 60 child meet inclusion criterion ratio 1:1 follow-up least 24 month per participant pool 10,000 child SCA attend two study site , AKTH MMSH , locate Kano , Nigeria . Similar method operation procedure SPIN Trial participant site use conduct propose trial . Among study population 10,000 child SCA Kano , &lt; 1 % receive TCD measurement two study site ; therefore , expect â‰¥ 100 child initial stroke annually , base incidence 1 per 100 patient years.2 Among initial stroke untreated , include child stroke study site , expect least 50 % recurrent stroke within two years.3 Rarely opportunity conduct trial likely result paradigm shift medical care child stroke . Completion trial provide target strategy secondary stroke prevention region world regular blood transfusion therapy routinely available , child stroke leave reasonable alternative stroke prevention .</detailed_description>
