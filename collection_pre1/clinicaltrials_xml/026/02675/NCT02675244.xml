	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine whether repair tricuspid valve ( TV ) patient mild moderate tricuspid regurgitation ( TR ) , time plan mitral valve surgery ( MVS ) , would improve heart health receive compare . At point , medical community split opinion whether surgeon routinely repair mild moderate TR patient undergo planned mitral valve surgery , study answer question .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Benefit Concurrent Tricuspid Valve Repair During Mitral Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The tricuspid valve control flow blood heart right ventricle right atrium . TR condition valve close fully suppose blood leak back right atrium . When TR become severe , surgery usually perform correct . The purpose research determine whether repair tricuspid valve patient mild moderate TR , time plan mitral valve surgery , would improve heart health receive compare . There new `` experimental '' procedure test study : mitral valve procedure tricuspid valve repair procedure well establish surgery regularly perform together patient severe TR . The available evidence address issue definite : base less rigorous method investigation , result conflict . The study propose use rigorous scientific method result high level certainty surgical treatment best patient condition . This study enroll people schedule mitral valve surgery mild moderate tricuspid regurgitation .</detailed_description>
