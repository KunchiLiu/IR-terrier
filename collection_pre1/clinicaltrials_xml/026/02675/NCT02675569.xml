	<brief_summary>This pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) multi-center , parallel-arm , open label . It test feasibility safety randomize elderly patient end-stage kidney failure start hemodialysis tunneled/non-tunneled catheter one follow vascular access strategy : ( ) attempt fistula creation ( intervention ) , ( b ) continue use catheter ( comparator ) . A total number 100 participant enrol pilot RCT . The rationale trial include : ( 1 ) importance intervention question relate choice vascular access patient treated hemodialysis ; ( 2 ) lack evidence clinical trial decision-making area ( observational study available ) ; ( 3 ) exist study suggest fistula use associate well patient outcome prone selection bias ; ( 4 ) need clinical trial compare impact two frequently choose strategy vascular access ( catheter fistula ) hemodialysis population ; ( 5 ) feasible safe trial design . The result obtain pilot RCT determine feasibility safety conduct large RCT , power primary outcome all-cause mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : This pilot RCT help address challenge relate patient recruitment , protocol adherence , safety , data collection hemodialysis population . The primary outcome pilot RCT feasibility , measure patient recruitment protocol adherence . The secondary outcome include feasibility-related outcome , safety ( include expect procedure-related outcome cause hospital admission ) , protocol violation . Hypothesis : Results obtain pilot RCT provide feasibility safety data conduct large RCT , establish good understand clinical outcome associate use fistula versus catheter vascular access hemodialysis population . Research Method : This multicenter , open-label , RCT , expect conduct 36 month . All screened people meet eligibility criterion follow data collect minimal dataset : eligibility , age , sex , program/center , height , weight , comorbid condition , detail prior treatment acute chronic kidney failure ( e.g. , previous peritoneal dialysis , kidney transplant , hemodialysis ) . Every consent participant follow additional data collect baseline : baseline laboratory value , baseline hemodialysis initiation , history access procedure , patient-reported outcome measure ( include data quality life vascular access questionnaire ) , grip strength . The pilot RCT consist 6 month site preparation , approximately 24 month participant accrual , 6 month additional follow-up time last randomized participant . An additional 6 month use assess preliminary data , prepare report pilot RCT , prepare submit funding application large RCT . Participants pilot RCT roll large RCT , therefore follow total 36 month ( 3 year ) randomization ass adherence trial protocol , assess safety outcome , collect qualitative data . Statistical Analysis Plan : The primary analysis pilot RCT descriptive . The proportion people meet feasibility endpoint accompany 95 % confidence interval calculate . Investigators describe participant characteristic evaluate reason protocol violation , well calculate rate drop-ins event . Interim subgroup analysis conduct pilot RCT . Expected Procedure-Related Outcomes ( Safety Data ) : As catheter fistula treatment strategy standard care , procedure-related outcome well know . Investigators collect expect procedure-related outcome ( i.e. , event potentially causal relationship strategy ) occur within 7 day execution access relate intervention . These include hospital admission prolongation hospitalization , status change , bacterial infection , catheter exit site infection , cannulation injury event . In addition , sit report incident participant death occur trial period . Cause death determine trial site investigator , base trial-specific list classification , adjudicate accuracy appropriate member trial steer committee , blind treatment arm .</detailed_description>
