	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury require dialysis ( AKI-D ) increase considerably last 15 year . The national rise incidence acute kidney injury several ramification term cost health service result cost therapy also later consequence AKI development chronic kidney disease cardiovascular disease . Mortality patient AKI-D high remains unchanged last decade England . In recent year become clearer even national incidence case-fatality AKI influence regional variation . In last three decade , many study report unwarranted variation wide range procedure , performance cesarean section coronary angiography treatment early prostate cancer , stroke , ailment chronically ill . In surgical care evidence variation may drive force patient illness medical appropriateness access care socioeconomic factor , provider capacity local system , medical malpractice pressure , distinctly different local practice . Despite public health burden AKI-D England , unclear regional variation exist AKI-D . Variation incidence AKI-D different region country may influence patient physician demographic region , physician preference nature hospital serve population . To reduce incidence case fatality AKI-D , imperative understand variation incidence case-fatality AKI-D exists different region country . To address gap knowledge , investigator combine national database hospital admission discharge census data office national statistic period fifteen year determine trend change regional incidence case fatality AKI require dialysis England . The investigator also explore various determinant regional variation dialysis require AKI . Methods Data source The investigator extract 2000-2015 data Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) , data warehouse contain detail admission , outpatient appointment , A &amp; E attendances National Health Service ( NHS ) hospital England . Definitions The investigator identify case AKI use validated International Classification Diseases , Tenth Revision , Clinical Modification ( ICD-10-CM ) cod diagnosis code , keep objective study . Patients follow code include : N17.0 acute renal failure ( ARF ) tubular necrosis , N17.1 ARF acute cortical necrosis , N17.2 ARF medullary necrosis , N17.8 ARF N17.9 ARF , unspecified . ARF replace new terminology , AKI , due lack ICD10 cod AKI , investigator use ICD10 code ARF henceforth , refer AKI study . The investigator also extract available secondary diagnosis 24 Office Population Censuses Surveys Classification Interventions Procedures , 4th revision ( OPCS-4 ) code . To identify patient AKI-D , investigator include OPCS code X40.3 hemodialysis X40.4 hemofiltration 25 procedure . Patients chronic kidney disease stage 5 ( CKD-5 ) start chronic dialysis end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) ICD-10 code N18.5 N18.6 respectively exclude . The investigator also exclude OPCS-4 code Arteriovenous fistula ( L74.2 ) Arteriovenous graft ( L74.3 ) inpatient admission . HES data stratifies patient location 16 different region . The geographic region England stratify per Office National Statistic ( ONS ) nine region : North East , North West , Yorkshire Humber , East Midlands , West Midlands , East England , London , South East South West . Patients ' geographical location outside nine region exclude . Patients admit , discharge study period include study . The investigator also obtain complete hospital discharge region estimate effect hospitalization AKI-D incidence rate , along number nephrology consultant region 2000 2015 Health Social Care Information Centre ( HSCIC ) annual census medical dental staff NHS . The investigator also obtain linkage ONS UK Renal Registry ( UKRR ) long-term patient renal outcome . To obtain population incidence AKI-D region , mid-year population region year 2000 2015 obtain ONS .</brief_summary>
