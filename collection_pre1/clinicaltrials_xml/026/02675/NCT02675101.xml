This study 3 treatment arm : A ) Whole nuts high fat content ( almonds walnut ; 110g total/day , n=15 ) , B ) Olestra : Fat Free PringlesTM potato chip ( ≈29 crisp , 18g Olestra/day ; n=15 ) , C ) Vegetable oil : Original PringlesTM potato chip ( ≈29 crisp , 17.4g oil/day ; n=15 ) .

	<brief_title>Nuts Olestra Persistent Organic Pollutant Reduction ( NO-POPs ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent organic pollutant ( POPs ) mostly fat-soluble halogenated chemical long half-lives . POPs endocrine disruptors , associate increase risk diabetes , alteration thyroid function , hypertension , dyslipidemia neurobehavioral alteration study child , adult include elderly . Some prevalent POPs include organochlorine pesticide , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDEs ) . Most POPs excrete bile due lipophilic nature . However , substantial amount reabsorb small intestine return blood stream ( entero-hepatic circulation ) . Two small clinical trial find bile acid sequestrants ( cholestyramine , cholestimide ) enhance fecal excretion organochlorines 2-3 day treatment significantly lower blood concentration 6 month . One pilot trial report decrease blood PCB concentration adult 1 year treatment fat-free potato crisp make olestra , non-absorbable synthetic fat , versus standard potato crisp . POPs think bind olestra excreted feces . Replication find need . Nuts , could yield similar effect . Nuts foods high-fat content incompletely absorbed intestine ( 21-24 % calorie absorb ) . As people age , body burden POPs increase . The almost ubiquitous presence endocrine disrupt POPs US adult substantial public health concern , particularly establish treatment reduce body concentration POPs . There potential dietary intervention important role reduction POPs population level due low cost wide use . The investigator aim measure 24 POPs ( 9 OC pesticide , 10 PCBs , 5 PBDEs ) blood ( participant ) stool sample ( subset 10 participant per treatment arm ) treatment period . The specific aim pilot study : 1 . Assess effectiveness recruitment strategy , acceptance compliance treatment arm , establish feasibility conduct large trial . 2 . Conduct preliminary testing hypothesis : Consumption olestra ( fat free Pringles ) : A ) increase fecal content ( excretion ) POPs , B ) decrease blood level POPs , compare control arm ( standard crisp ) . 3 . Conduct preliminary testing hypothesis : Consumption nut : A ) increase fecal content ( excretion ) POPs , B ) decrease blood level POPs , compare control arm ( standard crisp ) .</detailed_description>
