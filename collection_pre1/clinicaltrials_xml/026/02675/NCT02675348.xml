	<detailed_description>This investigation involve 10 week randomise , balance , double blind parallel group between-subjects design aim analyse effect combine exercise post exercise nutrition strategy ( hydrolysates beef protein , whey protein isocaloric carbohydrate placebo ) training outcome , body composition blood marker period regular training feed intervention . Participants divide three-treatment group 1 ) Hydrolysed meat-protein ( Beef ) ; 2 ) Whey ( Whey ) 3 ) non-protein iso-energetic placebo ( CHO ) . Once consider eligible study , initial familiarisation period baseline test , participant randomly assign one intervention group : Beef ; Whey CHO . Each group follow 10-week periodised endurance training intervention combine one three specific supplementation treatment ( Beef , Whey CHO ) . Measurements blood , body composition , muscle structure endurance performance determine train intervention . Once informed consent health history obtain , baseline Assessment ( t1 ) , participant divide three similar profile group , match body mass , age , sex performance ( Vo2max ) . 1 ) The Beef protein group ( Beef n=12 ) take 20g hydrolysate beef protein powder 250 ml water 2 ) The whey group ( n=12 ) take 20 g whey intact isolate powder mix 250 ml water 3 ) contrast group ( CHO n=12 ) take iso-energetic non-protein , carbohydrate ( 20 f maltodextrin plus 250 ml water ) contrast . Participants : Thirty six participant , recruit Kent , Medway University Campus , take part project . After informed risk , discomfort , benefit involve , participant sign write informed consent regard participation . Intervention Familiarization period : Participants undertake 1 session familiarisation test procedure . A qualified conditioning coach control assist participant order guarantee correct understand assessment procedure ( Body composition , vo2max test , muscle thickness , etc ) . All participant instruct appropriate use Rate Perceived Exertion ( 6-20 ) Borg scale heart rate monitor control load training intensity test training . Endurance Training : Participants commit follow polarise triphasic endurance-training model . This model contain three intensity zone calculate low intensity [ â‰¥ first ventilatory threshold ( VT1 ) , ~ 70 % HRmax ] ; moderate intensity [ VT1 respiratory compensation point ventilatory threshold 2 ( VT2 ) , &gt; 70 &lt; 90 % HRmax ] ; high intensity [ &gt; VT2 , 90 % HRmax ] ( Esteve-Lanao et al. , 2007 ) . Participants train 4 6 time per week total percentage distribution 75 80 % low intensity ; 10 % moderate intensity , 15 10 % high intensity . Supplementation protocol : Training day : Immediately ( &lt; 10 min ) com Non-training day : breakfast . Supplements placebo provide powder form mix 250 ml plain water moment consumption . Supplements placebo look taste identical . Thus , total one 20g dos administer daily base . Participants ingest total 70 dos total 10 week study intervention . Supplement provide 14 day base blind researcher Participants return back empty bag supplement/placebo consume previous 14 day period .</detailed_description>
