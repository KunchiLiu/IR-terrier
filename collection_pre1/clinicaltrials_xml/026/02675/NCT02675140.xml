	<detailed_description>Subjects ethical approval This randomize , control double-blinded cohort study perform Dayi , Pixian Meishan country , Sichuan Province , western China , suburbs Chengdu city low class socioeconomic status , March 2012 September 2014 approximately 216 anemic preschool child age 3-6 year randomly recruit nine kindergarten three country study intervention period . The eligibility criterion participation follow : 1 ) apparent health ; 2 ) Hb concentration &lt; 110 g/l &lt; 80 g/l ; 3 ) C-reaction protein ( CRP ) &lt; 10 mg/L ; 4 ) parental guardian approval participation aspect study ; 5 ) parental/guardian agreement avoid additional use vitamin mineral supplement de-hookworm administration trial . Children Hb &lt; 80 g/l /or CRP &gt; 10 mg/l send hospital special treatment . We conduct census regional kindergarten determine household include eligibility preschool child . Then field health worker conduct family survey determine child include . Eligible family visit field worker explain protocol , answered question , obtain write informed consent parents/guardians . The enrollment research plan review approved institutional ethic committee Chengdu Women 's Children 's Central Hospital Chongqing Medical University Sichuan province , China . The present study comply code ethic World Medical Association ( Declaration Helsinki ) . The primary objective present study measure change serum Hb intervention . A sample size 60 anemic preschool child per group require detect absolute difference 10 g/L Hb concentration among three intervention group supplementation 95 % power α= 0.05 two-sided two-sample t-test . To allow 20 % rate dropout duration study , initially plan recruit 72 anemic child per group ( totally 216 ) . We estimate prevalence anemia preschool child locality 16 % [ 17 ] , eventually 1350 child recruit initial Hb screening study intervention 450 group . Intervention All eligible anemic child randomly divide three group : Group 1 receive intervention control group ; Group 2 receive 400 mg single-dose albendazole administration Group 3 receive 200,000 IU vitamin A capsule combine 400 mg single-dose albendazole initially . For ethical reason , child control group give single-dose albendazole end study . Immediately recruitment , child one class assign study number previously randomly assign intervention control group fix , equal allocation group prepare third party . The RAND function Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA , USA ) use generate computer randomly permutated code . The physician , nurse , field health worker , parent , child laboratory personnel blind treatment assignment child throughout study period . The data manager , statistician , investigator remain blinded group assignment end data analysis . The total duration intervention evaluation six month . Vitamin A capsule albendazole tablet provide Sichuan Pearl Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd . Compliance Compliance albendazole tablet vitamin A capsule monitor use record table , teacher record whether child consume `` '' `` none '' albendazole tablet vitamin A capsule . To avoid exchange albendazole tablet vitamin A capsule classmate , three group physically separate move opposite corner classroom . Distribution consumption albendazole tablet vitamin A capsule take place close supervision ; child group 2 group 3 allow leave classroom return original seat finish eat albendazole tablet vitamin A capsule . The distribution tablet perform nursery manager , health care worker nursery teacher . Information acceptability albendazole tablet vitamin A capsule obtain short questionnaire administer . Questionnaire interview A 30-minute questionnaire conduct trained interviewer recruitment . The questionnaire include question demographic information ( child 's age , sex ) , educational level main caregiver ( least responsible half care time child ) , monthly family income , use vitamin/mineral supplement trial food frequency recall ( frequency deep-colored vegetable milk , liver egg ) . Anthropometric measurement Anthropometric examination conduct trained anthropometric nurse baseline follow-up ( 6-mo ) time point use standardized technique eliminate intra-examiner error . Duplicate measurement perform child . The inter-examiner coefficient variation weight height examiner group le 5 % . Weight record use weigh scale ( 100Med , Beijing , China ) near 100 g subject minimal clothing bare foot . Similarly , height measure standard position height scale ( Haode , Guangzhou , China ) near 0.1 cm . By use reference data World Health Organization ( WHO ; 2005 ) , Z-scores calculate height age ( HAZ ) , weight height ( WHZ ) , weight age ( WAZ ) . All index compute use Anthro ( 2005 ) personal computer , recommend WHO ( http : //www.who.int/childgrowth/software/en/ ) . Blood sample collection biochemical assessment At begin 3 6 month intervention , three blood sample ( 1 mL ) collect venipuncture antecubital vein subject breakfast hospital . A quarter milliliter drawn container contain heparin measure Hb hemoglobincyanide method ( Maker , Chengdu , China ) . The interassay variation lower 5 % intra-assay variation lower 10 % . The blood sample immediately store 4° C prevent micro-hemolysis separate within 5 h. The remain blood centrifuge 3000g 5 min room temperature . The centrifuged serum sample divide aliquot immediately transport laboratory store -20°C . The concentration serum ferritin ( SF ) measure use commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ( Sunbiote , Shanghai , China ) . Serum soluble transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) measure microparticle-enhanced immunoassay ( Sunbiote , Shanghai , China ) . CRP measure particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetry ( Sunbiote , Shanghai , China ) . Serum retinol concentration determine use high-performance liquid chromatography . Serum retinol measure experienced examiner Pediatric Laboratory Chongqing Medical University biochemical index Clinical Laboratory Center Chengdu Women &amp; Children 's Central Hospital .</detailed_description>
