Patients Stage III ( IIIB IIIC ) colon cancer define 7th Edition American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) Cancer Staging Manual randomize 1:1 placebo experimental agent regorafenib follow completion least four month standard adjuvant therapy ( e.g. , 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin , oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ) , capecitabine , oxaliplatin ( CapeOx ) , ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Regorafenib Following Completion Standard Chemotherapy Patients With Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study determine value regorafenib improve DFS . The secondary aim evaluate dose tolerance long term toxicity two year regorafenib follow standard adjuvant therapy , evaluate effect use regorafenib overall survival ( OS ) . Eligible patient double-blind study randomize take either regorafenib 120 mg placebo orally , daily 21 consecutive day 28 day cycle 26 cycle ( 2 year ) . Accrual study approximately 1118 randomized patient . These 1118 patient provide approximately 313 DFS event time primary analysis . An initial futility analysis perform 312 patient study least 3 month . The decision continue trial determine success early stop endpoint define follow : - The toxicity profile regorafenib compare placebo acceptable . - The regorafenib regimen tolerable prolonged administration . An estimated compliance rate 60 % 6 month regorafenib require continuation study . If toxicity acceptable compliance regorafenib least 60 % nominally , accrual continue . The second futility analysis conduct approximately 67 DFS event observe . Trial conduct accrual continue unless primary endpoint ( DFS ) trend far opposite direction ( hazard ratio great equal 1.1 ) . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . NSABP C-13 include Behavioral Health Outcomes correlative science component . A C-13 Quality Life ( QOL ) questionnaire administer baseline ( consent prior randomization ) 3 month , 6 month , 12 month , 18 month , 24 month , 30 month . Submission blood sample C-13 correlative science study study requirement patient . Submissions also include archived primary tumor tissue resect colon primary . Blood sample pharmacokinetics ( PK ) collect Day 15 Cycle 1 Day 15 Cycle 2 , additional blood sample biomarkers collect various time point future analysis .</detailed_description>
