	<brief_summary>This prospective , observational study inflammatory mechanism lipid metabolism resuscitation cardiac arrest target temperature management . Investigators focus elucidate two biochemical pathway . The first neuregulin-1 ( NRG-1 ) , growth factor regulate cell resistance oxidative stress , cell survival proliferation . The second relate lipid peroxidation pro-inflammatory lipid precursor . Participants undergo blood sample 7 day follow cardiac arrest , analyse perform . Patient characteristic , clinical circumstance , outcomes recorded association inflammatory pathway characterize .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuregulin-1 ( NRG-1 ) growth factor crucially regulate cell resistance oxidative stress , cell survival proliferation . In preliminary study , investigator find novel role NRG-1 regulation pro-inflammatory activation human mononuclear myeloid cell ( monocyte macrophage ) . These cell represent major contributor tissue perpetuation inflammation . The investigator hypothesize NRG-1 play role prevention additional brain damage mediate post-cardiac arrest cell-mediated inflammatory response . To test hypothesis , investigator determine NRG-1 protein level NRG activity different time point peripheral blood patient resuscitation cardiac arrest . Using flow cytometry , investigator also investigate expression ERBB ( neuregulin ) receptor monocytes . The investigator evaluate relationship circulate NRG-1 , ERBB receptor expression , marker inflammation , duration ischemic time , biomarkers severity neurological cardiac injury cardiac arrest . A second inflammatory pathway concern lipid metabolism . An `` obesity paradox '' exist cardiac arrest myocardial infarction disease , mild moderate obesity seem protective mortality despite high incidence adverse event therapy . To characterize role lipid post-resuscitation inflammatory milieu , investigator prospectively determine serial serum lipid profile , measure lipid peroxidation pro-inflammatory lipid precursor lean obese post cardiac arrest patient . This allow researcher investigate independent association body mass index ( BMI ) , lipid profile , lipid peroxidation , pro-inflammatory lipid precursor post-resuscitation inflammatory state , functional outcome . Participants undergo series blood draw 7 day , standard 6 month follow ass functional outcome . Investigators record standard element postresuscitation care include demographic , clinical characteristic , laboratory value include biomarkers neurological injury , radiographic finding .</detailed_description>
