	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether treatment study drug tetrahydrouridine-decitabine ( THU-Dec ) combination nivolumab effective treatment nivolumab alone patient NSCLC . Decitabine investigational ( experimental ) drug work deplete DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) . DNMT1 enzyme , protein cause chemical change , often increase cancer . Blocking DNMT1 show reduce tumor formation . Decitabine experimental study approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) patient lung cancer . Decitabine approve FDA treat patient blood disease call myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS , condition bone marrow make blood cell normally ) . THU investigational ( experimental ) drug work block enzyme break decitabine . This enzyme highly express solid tissue body , limit distribution decitabine tissue , include solid cancer tissue . So , THU increase time cell body expose decitabine . The idea THU also increase time lung cancer cell expose decitabine . THU experimental also approve FDA , although extensively used clinical trial , include several cancer trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To determine non-cytotoxic oral THU-Dec combine nivolumab improve objective response rate nivolumab Secondary objective : ) To evaluate clinical efficacy end point toxicity oral THU-Dec combine nivolumab ii ) evaluate induction T-cell response patient metastatic NSCLC iii ) To evaluate hypothesis regard mechanism resistance predictive biomarkers response nivolumab Study design : This Phase 2 randomize two arm trial nivolumab alone combination THU-Dec , previously treat patient stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . The primary goal trial compare efficacy oral THU-Dec way enhance anti-tumor immune response nivolumab nivolumab alone . The primary efficacy endpoint overall RECIST-defined response . To accomplish goal 60 patient randomize 2:1 THU-Dec plus nivolumab nivolumab respectively .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologicallyproven NSCLC Subjects must receive 1 prior systemic therapy disease , prior treatment immunotherapy ; ( include immune checkpoint inhibitor drug , immunotherapy vaccine ) ; Patients EGFR ALK alteration need progress TKI treatment Measurable disease per RECIST1.1 Disease access bronchoscopic , surgical percutaneous biopsy Eligible biopsy safety perspective Agrees percutaneous biopsy prior study , may eligible archival tissue biopsy recent therapy . ECOG performance status 0 2 Adequate organ function define follow criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥8.5g/dL ≥5.6mmol/L Serum creatinine ≤1.5 time upper limit normal Measured calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 30mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 time institutional upper level normal ( ULN ) Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 time upper limit normal Direct bilirubin ≤ upper limit normal subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) ≤2.5 time upper limit normal ≤5 time upper limit normal subject liver metastasis ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 time upper limit normal ≤5 time upper limit normal subject liver metastasis Albumin ≥ 2 mg/dL Patients history brain metastasis eligible study treatment minimum 1 week follow completion gamma knife whole brain radiotherapy . ( patient underwent surgical resection brain metastasis need wait 4 week study treatment ) Patients ideally steroids start study treatment , however patient steroid taper dose 2mg/day Decadron time study treatment allow ; steroid taper quickly clinically feasible . Subjects must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Any follow within 6 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , severe peripheral vascular disease ( claudication ) procedure peripheral vasculature , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , New York Heart Association grade II great congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , clinically significant bleed pulmonary embolism . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness ( HIVpositive subject combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction oral THUDec . Appropriate study undertaken subject receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Pregnancy breastfeed ( pregnant breastfeed woman exclude study oral THUDec potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown , potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother oral THUDec , breastfeed discontinue mother treated oral THUDec . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent ; Patients receive palliative radiation therapy within 1 week prior day 1 allow . Patients treatment target therapy ( like EGFR ALK TKIs ) may start study treatment 5 day last treatment . Receiving investigational agent Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 217 day last dose trial treatment . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy .</criteria>
