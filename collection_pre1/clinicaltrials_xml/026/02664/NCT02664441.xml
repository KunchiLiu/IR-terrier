	<brief_summary>The propose multicenter study test effect glucagon-like peptide ( GLP ) -1 agonist exenatide weekly extended-release ( ExQW , Bydureon® ) clinical outcome metabolic parameter double-blind , placebo-controlled 36 week randomize trial 18 week open label extension . Following baseline test , 48 patient randomly assign equal allocation ExQW match placebo injection 36 week , follow 18 week open label extension patient receive ExQW . Changes weight status , body composition , free-living total daily energy expenditure ( EE ) doubly label water ( DLW ) , activity acetimetry , energy intake ( questionnaire food diary ) , well glucose tolerance hormonal parameter energy homeostasis insulin resistance assess treatment end placebo-controlled phase ( week 36 ) . Activity , metabolic outcome , energy intake also assess study week 18 ( mid treatment randomize study ) , well week 54 ( end open label treatment ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Energy Balance &amp; Weight Loss Craniopharyngioma-related Hypothalamic Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excessive weight gain cardiometabolic sequela frequent complication hypothalamic tumor , condition know hypothalamic obesity ( HO ) . Most tumor region craniopharyngiomas ( CP ) ,1 constitute 5-9 % childhood brain tumor . Patients CP typically become obese feature metabolic syndrome compare matched control . Overall , 3-19-fold high cardiovascular mortality report , recent nationwide population-based study Sweden demonstrate increase rate cerebral infarction ( 7-fold ) , death due cerebrovascular disease ( 5-fold ) , type 2 diabetes mellitus ( 6-fold ) CP patient comparison general population . Thus , early effective management obesity vital population , resistant treatment uncomplicated obesity . Recognized risk factor severe obesity include large hypothalamic tumor lesion affect several medial posterior hypothalamic nuclei impact satiety signal pathway . Structural damage nuclei often lead uncontrolled appetite , rapid weight gain , central insulin leptin resistance , decrease sympathetic activity , low energy expenditure ( EE ) , increase energy storage adipose tissue . Recently , investigator develop semi-quantitative assessment hypothalamic damage brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) predict risk HO development CP . Previous result treat HO glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonist ( GLP1RA ) rat human provide promise proof-of-principle data support current randomize clinical trial . The primary hypothesis study drug cause weight loss via intact hindbrain signal pathway offer desperately need option treatment HO , even obese HO subject severe hypothalamic damage . Induction weight loss GLP1RAs believe related multiple mechanism involve gastrointestinal tract , vagus nerve , brain lead increased satiety . Peripheral administration GLP-1 GLP1RA reduce blood glucose energy intake human rodent , long-term treatment result loss body weight . Critically , investigator know whether GLP1RA treatment affect EE activity , whether site size brain lesion affect response GLP1RA treatment . The investigator ' previous clinical study GLP1RA exenatide obese adolescent adult generate critical safety efficacy data need design clinical trial . In pilot study conduct Children 's Hospitals Clinics MN , pretreatment hyperphagia associate BMI reduction . Using data , investigator design prospective , multicenter trial examine effect GLP1RA BMI , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor , energy homeostasis factor subject HO secondary CP .</detailed_description>
