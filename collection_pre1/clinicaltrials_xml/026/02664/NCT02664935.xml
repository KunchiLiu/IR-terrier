	<brief_summary>The trial consist series parallel multi-centre single arm phase II trial arm , test experimental target drug population stratify multiple pre-specified actionable target putative biomarkers . The primary objective evaluate whether signal activity drug- ( putative ) biomarker cohort separately . A Bayesian adaptive design adopt achieve objective statistical detail give Protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial primarily enrichment putative biomarker design , include patient positive least one actionable target include trial . Patients positive one putative biomarker receive experimental target drug specific putative biomarker . Putative biomarkers within drug cohort choose majority case expect patient positive two putative biomarkers within drug . In rare situation patient positive two putative biomarkers relevant across different drug , treatment allocate accordance follow strategy : - All amplification rearrangement treat targeted agent appropriate irrespective concomitant mutation . This yield crucial predictive biomarker information . - For concomitant mutation decision make Chief Investigator case-by-case basis base close consideration pathway preference likely dominance one signal pathway another together pre-clinical efficacy study address activity drug presence concomitant mutation . A trump strategy devise purpose .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must complete standard care therapy treat oncologist think appropriate . As minimum patient must fail one line treatment ( either radiological documentation disease progression due toxicity ) . Patients progress surgical resection adjuvant therapy eligible entry without need administration first line metastatic therapy , progress within 6 month complete adjuvant treatment . Patients also eligible without necessity first line regimen relapse within 6 month completion definitive chemoradiation . Consented provide adequate specimen adequately characterise molecular genotype tumour molecular prescreening accord molecular exclusion rule ( see section 6.4 definition adequate sample ) . Histological cytologically confirm NSCLC stage III ( suitable radical radiotherapy surgery ) stage IV . This include patient may abnormal histology , IHC strongly support either squamous cell carcinoma ( p63 positivity ) adenocarcinoma ( Thyroid transcription factor 1 [ TTF1 ] positivity ) . If physician pathologist convince multidisciplinary review patient stage III IV NSCLC IHC negative morphology distinguish specific subtype , patient eligible nonhistology specific cohort . CT scan head , chest abdomen within 28 day treatment demonstrate measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 . Adequate haematological function within 7 day treatment . Haemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L . Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L . Adequate hepatic function within 7 day treatment patient liver metastasis ( see arm specific entry criterion adequate hepatic function patient liver metastasis ) . Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Alanine transferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Aspartate transferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Adequate renal function within 7 day treatment . Creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) &gt; 50 ml/min ( measure calculate Cockcroft Gault equation ) . Age ≥ 18 year . Females must agree use adequate contraceptive measure , breast feeding must negative pregnancy test prior start dose childbearing potential must evidence nonchildbearing potential fulfil one follow criterion screen : Postmenopausal define age 50 year amenorrhoeic least 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment Documentation irreversible surgical sterilisation hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy bilateral salpingectomy tubal ligation . Women age 50 year old would consider postmenopausal amenorrhoeic 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment luteinizing hormone ( LH ) follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level postmenopausal range institution . Provision sign date , write informed consent prior study specific procedure , sample analysis . Major surgery ( exclude placement vascular access ) , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , investigational agent anticancer therapy within 4 week prior treatment . Nausea , vomit , chronic gastrointestinal disease ( e.g . inflammatory bowel disease ) would preclude adequate absorption . Any psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition hamper protocol compliance . Concurrent malignancy invasive cancer diagnose within past 3 year except adequately treat basal cell carcinoma skin situ carcinoma uterine cervix . Judgement investigator patient participate study patient unlikely comply study procedure , restriction requirement . Any unresolved toxicity grade 2 , 3 4 previous treatment ( exclude alopecia ) Registration ( see CTCAE ) . Patients previous symptomatic brain metastasis spinal cord compression exclude unless adequate treatment , evidence progression symptom , requirement steroid treatment previous 28 day commencement trial treatment . Patients asymptomatic brain metastasis pick screen CT scan exclude provide view investigator require immediate radiotherapy surgical intervention , requirement steroid treatment previous 28 day commencement trial treatment . As judged investigator , evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , include active bleeding diatheses , active infection include hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus .
