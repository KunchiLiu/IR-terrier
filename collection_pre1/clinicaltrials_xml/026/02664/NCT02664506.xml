	<detailed_description>Based research word processing verbal STM impairment aphasia , propose co-occurrence impairment due disruption cognitive process support ability : maintenance activate semantic phonological representation word , hereafter 'activation -- maintenance hypothesis ' . This hypothesis test context treatment approach aim improve word processing verbal STM ability . Recently , importance treatment research emphasize critical testing ground theory language processing . Although demonstrated association impairment word processing reduce verbal STM capacity support 'activation-maintenance hypothesis ' , direct treatment improve ability maintain activation word representation serve strong test hypothesis . First , empirical support establish hypothesis impairment short-term maintenance activate semantic phonological representation word impairs language verbal STM ability aphasia direct treatment deficit improve ability ( Specific Aim 1 ) . Second , effect treatment compare two administration condition , high low intensity ( Specific aim 2 ) . Finally , neural region associate semantic STM phonological STM investigate use voxel -- base lesion -- symptom mapping ( Bates et al. , 2003 ) ( Specific Aim 3 ) . This research represent unique attempt apply recent processing theory aphasia treatment disorder.The outcome important implication aphasia rehabilitation research .</detailed_description>
