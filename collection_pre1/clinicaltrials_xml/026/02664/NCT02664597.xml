	<brief_title>ADNEXMR Scoring System : Impact MR Scoring System Therapeutic Strategy Pelvic Adnexal Masses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context rational Ovarian cancer fifth lead cause death among neoplastic disease woman develop country ( 1 ) . The 5-year survival rate 90 % patient stage I disease diagnosis 2 % diagnosed stage non-specific nature total absence symptom initial phase disease ( 12 ) . Survival rate strongly depend complete surgical resection first surgery 5-year survival rate 20 % incompletely resect stage III tumor ( 2 ) . Thus , preoperative diagnosis strategy must improve . Four multicentric randomize trial ( 3-6 ) underline lack specificity classic diagnosis strategy consist combination measurement CA125 transvaginal ultrasonography ( TVS ) detect characterize adnexal mass . In PCLO trial , 30 patient underwent surgery every cancer diagnose ( 3 ) . According multicenter study conduct France ( 9 ) , surgery mainly indicate tumor size ultrasonographic data high rate benignity finally find pathology ( 83.3 % ) previously demonstrate ( 13 ) . Recent trial show inappropriate intervention woman benign adnexal lesion lead significant morbidity mortality . In PCLO trial , among 1080 woman false positive result ( i.e benign lesion ) underwent surgery , 163 ( 15 % ) least one serious complication ( 3 ) . All woman operative anaesthesic risk , increase menopausal woman suffer diabetes high pressure blood ( 8 ) . Moreover , pre-menopausal woman , fertility usually main issue negative impact surgery well know . Two surgical procedure exist management adnexal mass . The conservative one , laparoscopy become gold standard treatment benign adnexal tumor laparotomy remain standard treatment malignant tumor . However , even laparoscopy may induce severe adhesion unnecessary damage ovarian tissue ( 14 ) . According Huchon al. , high rate inappropriate procedure observe benign tumor also borderline invasive malignancy incomplete stag 16 % 50 % respectively , main prognostic factor ovarian cancer ( 9 ) . Inadequate surgical procedure may worsen prognosis fully inspection peritoneal cavity , tumor morcellation , cystic rupture especially surgeon without low expertise field . Bristow et al . demonstrate low-volume hospital ( HR 1.08 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.16 ) low-volume physician ( HR 1.18 , 95 % CI 1.09-1.28 ) associate decreased disease-specific survival ( 7 ) . Thus , preoperative diagnosis crucial refer patient gynecologist oncologist specialize tertial cancer center suspicion ovarian cancer . An alternative evidence-based approach presurgical diagnosis adnexal tumor use Logistic regression model ( LR2 ) Simple Rules develop International Ovarian Tumor Analysis ( IOTA ) group demonstrate recent updated meta-analysis . Irrespective method use group tumor remain difficult classify TVS . International Ovarian Tumor Analysis ( IOTA ) group others team estimate 25 % percentage adnexal mass remain indeterminate evident accurate second stage test would value group mass ( 15,16 ) . In set , MR image proven accurate second-line imaging technique ( 17 ) cost effective intervention ultrasonographically indeterminate mass ( 16 ) : Firstly , risk malignancy mass small ( low 20 % malignancy ) , particularly premenopausal woman . Secondly , remove need US follow , MR image offer possibility earlier diagnosis cancer minority woman malignant mass ( 17,18 ) . In literature , accuracy MRI distinguish malignant benign indeterminate adnexal mass range 83 % 93 % ( 18-20 ) , compare 63 % -80 % ultrasonography ( 21,22 ) . Recently , functional imaging technique add new criterion ( 23 ) conventional MRI improve interpretation , reproducibility characterization indeterminate adnexal mass , result accuracy high 95.3 % ( 19,24,25 ) However , among physician , debate exists relevance MR image characterize adnexal mass possibly due absence standardization MR report . In way , 25 % surgeon perform MR image surgery explain high incidence pre-operative misdiagnoses ( 9 ) . In 2013 , first MR score system adnexal mass name `` ADNEXMR SCORING system '' develop ( 10 ) . The feature include score system well establish , previously use distinguish benign malignant mass ( 26-31 ) . ADNEXMR SCORING system good discriminatory characteristic AUROC 0.981/0.964 training validating set ( 10 ) . A preliminary external validation perform validate set 4 external reader suggest high diagnostic performance ( AUROC 0.980 , 0.954 , 0.955 , 0.973 two senior two junior reader , respectively ) . For four subsequent radiologist , observed malignancy rate less 2 % , le 5 % , 5 % 90 % 90 % ADNEXMR-SCORE 2 , 3 , 4 5 , respectively . Therefore , classification easily adopt radiologist pelvic image improve report standardization . Finally , ADNEXMR SCORING system influence pelvic mass management . With score 4 5 , ADNEXMR SCORING system predict malignancy 93.5 % sensitivity ( 58/62 ) 96.6 % specificity ( 258/267 ) . Thus , risk malignancy high patient refer cancer center undergo appropriate surgical procedure first attempt . With score ≤ 3 , risk malignancy minimal patient may benefit image follow-up conservative treatment depend clinical symptom infertility history . Inspired BI-RADS classification breast tumor , ADNEXMR score system simple accurate five-category classification accuracy high 95 % . ADNEXMR Scoring system include functional data allows excellent tissue characterization allow miss cancer case score ≤ 3 tumor low 6cm . Indeed , hypothesis ADNEXMR score relay radiologist 's suspicion clinician potential aim improve patient management especially limit number inappropriate surgery . Up date , research test clinical impact MR score system management adnexal mass . Thus , research would first one finality homogenize clinical practice limit inappropriate procedure impact ( 1 ) morbidity fertility ( 32,33 ) , especially patient unnecessary undergoing surgery benign lesion ( 2 ) mortality patient undergo complete surgery ovarian cancer first attempt ( 34,35 ) . If study demonstrate hypothesis , result study important impact clinical practice , increase patient ' safety , associate possible major impact fertility due avoidance unnecessary surgery , together significant saving health service . Moreover , score could help clinician plan surgery accordingly refer patient specialized tertial cancer center case ovarian cancer well prognosis . Summary know foreseeable benefit risk research participants The control group undergo standard care treatment therefore associate risk benefit group . The intervention group undergo MR , may may standard care case . There significant risk associate MR scan apart minor discomfort inconvenience undergoing scan . The categorization AdnexMR score group highly unlikely risk patient validate large retrospective cohort patient ( 10 ) . However , possible risk patient cancer incorrectly categorize score 3 may undergo oncologic cytoreductive surgery initial treatment . This theoretical risk exists low none invasive cancer categorize score 3 large cohort ( n= 497 ) previously publish ( 10 ) . Primary objective To compare rate inappropriate surgery occur patient manage accord therapeutic strategy base ADNEXMR SCORING system therapeutic strategy perform clinical routine accord European Society Medical Oncology guideline ( 11 ) ( i.e . ultrasonography , CA125 +/-MR imaging ) . Reference standard : surgical histology / clinical image follow-up 24 month .
