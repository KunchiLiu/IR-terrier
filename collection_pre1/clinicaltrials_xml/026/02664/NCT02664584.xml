	<brief_summary>Background : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , osteoporosis dementia chronic disease age impact adversely live affected major health , social economic consequence . A number factor consider implicated disease , range establish factor less well recognise . Lifestyle factor diet , body weight , smoking , physical activity year education acknowledge risk factor development chronic disease age . Emerging research suggest elevate homocysteine and/or sub-optimal status metabolically relate B-vitamins ( folate , vitamin B12 , B6 riboflavin ) may associate high risk age-related disease . The interplay relevant genetic nutrient factor ( gene-nutrient interaction ) consider highly relevant development ( prevention ) chronic disease age , however relatively new area research yet poorly understood . The collection clinical , lifestyle , nutritional genetic data large number patient would permit investigation nutrient interact specific gene increase likelihood person develop chronic disease age . Aim : The aim TUDA study collect detail clinical , lifestyle , dietary , genetic biochemical data investigate gene-nutrient interaction ( particularly perspective B-vitamins vitamin D/calcium ) development CVD , osteoporosis dementia study old adult exhibit early stage common disease , namely hypertension , low bone mineral density , early memory loss , respectively . Secondary aim ( follow TUDA investigation ) : The aim longitudinal investigation re-assess clinical , nutritional , genetic biochemical factor relation progression disease outcomes TUDA study participant , subsequent year initial investigation . Study design : A total 6000 non-institutionalised old Irish people age 60 year early predictor either dementia , stroke osteoporosis ( namely early memory loss , high blood pressure low bone mineral density , respectively ) recruit three centre ( St James 's Hospital Dublin , Ulster University Coleraine The Clinical Translational Research Innovation Centre ( C-TRIC ) , Londonderry ) across Ireland . Non-fasting blood sample collect subject routine blood biochemistry profile biomarkers relevance B vitamin vitamin D status measure . Supplement use record target food frequency questionnaire use record dietary intake specific vitamin interest ( folate , B12 , B6 , riboflavin D ) major food source , particularly fortify food . Physiological function test include blood pressure , bone health ( DXA scan ) cognitive function test anthropometric measure also take .</brief_summary>
