	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine overall response rate single agent TRC105 combination TRC105 bevacizumab patient refractory GTN ( include choriocarcinoma , placental site trophoblastic tumor ( PSTT ) , epithelioid trophoblastic tumor ( ETT ) ) . Up 30 patient treat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study TRC105 Bevacizumab Patients With Refractory Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia ( GTN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRC105 monoclonal antibody bind endoglin , angiogenic target highly expressed tumor vessel tumor cell gestational trophoblastic neoplasia ( GTN ) . Bevacizumab monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibit angiogenesis extends survival patient wide variety solid tumor type . TRC105 well tolerate single agent combine bevacizumab . These antibody may efficacious refractory GTN , tumor type highly vascular show densely express endoglin .</detailed_description>
