	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , cross-over study healthy volunteer . In first part , duodenum participant perfuse acid saline , intragastric pressure monitor assess activation duodenogastric reflex . After perfusion , duodenal biopsy collect evaluate mucosal integrity . In second part , healthy volunteer treat mast cell stabilizer disodium cromoglycate placebo 14 day . Subsequently , duodenum perfuse acid intragastric pressure mucosal integrity evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite intensive research , pathophysiology functional dyspepsia remain unknown . The investigator recently demonstrate functional dyspepsia patient display impaired duodenal mucosal integrity low-grade mucosal inflammation . As study also show functional dyspepsia patient present increase spontaneous duodenal acid exposure , hypothesis study increase duodenal acid exposure result increase duodenal permeability via mast cell activation . This also induce activation duodenogastric reflex , result gastric relaxation , eventually lead generation dyspeptic symptom . The general aim project assess effect mast cell inhibition duodenal mucosal integrity intragastric pressure healthy volunteer acid infusion duodenum . The study randomize , double-blind , cross-over study 20 healthy volunteer consist 2 part . ( 1 ) In first part , 10 healthy volunteer perfuse acid ( 0.1N HCl ) 0.9 % saline 30 minute rate 5 mL/min interval least one month . During acid/saline perfusion , intragastric pressure measure high resolution manometry system evaluate activation duodenogastric reflex . Dyspeptic symptom score 1 minute every 5 minute infusion . After perfusion , endoscopy perform duodenal biopsy obtain evaluate mucosal integrity use Ussing chamber assess expression cell-to-cell adhesion protein ( real-time PCR , immunofluorescence western blot ) . ( 2 ) In second part , 10 healthy volunteer perfuse acid placebo treatment treatment mast cell stabilizer disodium cromoglycate 100mg 4x2/day ( interval least one month ) . The rest study continue describe part 1 .</detailed_description>
