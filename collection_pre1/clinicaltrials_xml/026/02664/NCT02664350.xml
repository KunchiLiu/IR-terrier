	<brief_summary>Pain one burdensome symptom associate cancer treatment , opioids cornerstone clinical pain management cancer patient . Yet , individual patient response opioids vary widely , patient 's genotype contribute variability . Specifically , cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) genotype important relevance response opioid analgesic depend CYP2D6 bioactivation . Poor metabolizers ( PMs ) low concentration active metabolite codeine ( morphine ) , tramadol ( O-desmethyltramadol ) , oxycodone ( oxymorphone ) , hydrocodone ( hydromorphone ) , compare extensive metabolizers ( EMs ) . Morphine O-desmethyltramadol 200-fold great affinity µ-opioid receptor parent compound , whereas oxymorphone hydromorphone 40-fold 10-fold high receptor affinity compare parent compound , respectively . Consequently , PMs may fail derive pain relief opioids compare EMs . Interestingly , occurrence side effect may differ PMs EMs PMs may get little pain relief certain opioid analgesic , may still experience troublesome adverse effect . Intermediate metabolizers ( IMs ) also expect reduced analgesic response base significant reduction enzyme activity . Conversely , individual UM phenotype may toxic concentration active opioid metabolite , report life-threatening toxicity death . The µ-opioid receptor gene ( OPRM1 ) primary bind site endogenous opioid peptide opioid analgesic , may additional contribution opioid response . The investigator propose examine effect CYP2D6 genotype-guided pain management cancer pain control study participant additional effect OPRM1 genotype response opioids .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , open label , multi-site clinical trial conduct UF Health Cancer Center Gainesville , FL Moffitt Cancer Center Tampa , FL . Each site responsible oversee patient care research respective facility . This research examine pain-related outcome CYP2D6-guided cancer pain management study participant . In addition , investigator evaluate prospective cohort study population examine effect OPRM1 genetic variant pain relief adverse drug effect time . Participants randomize 1:1 manner receive CYP2D6 genotype-guided ( n=50 ) non-genotype-guided ( traditional , n=50 ) selection pain medication . Patients genotype arm genotyped baseline CYP2D6 variant . Participants fill Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form ( BPI-SF ) M.D . Anderson Symptom Inventory ( MDASI ) questionnaires baseline . Then , clinical visit questionnaires do week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 telephone .</detailed_description>
