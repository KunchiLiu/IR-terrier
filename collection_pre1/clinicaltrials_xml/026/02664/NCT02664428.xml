	<detailed_description>The first result vitro test project PreBIOil delineate capacity flour olive modulate microbial population human intestine manner comparable inulin recognize polysaccharide capacity prebiotic . Based result , others literature , bakery product PreBIOil formulate . The product contain , flour olive , buckwheat , pea , chestnut . The overall objective study ass whether introduction diet bakery product prepared olive flour , mixed buckwheat , pea chestnut flour change profile intestinal microbiota plasma cholesterol , particular LDL . The study set dietary supplementation , double-blind , randomize , parallel control group , follow product compare : ) new bakery product design study PreBIOil ( test ) ; ii ) bakery product control isoenergetic ( control ) . Description Food supplement Trial The test product new baked product formulate mixture flour olive , buckwheat , pea chestnut appearance salty biscuit . Participants required consume daily 90 grams test control product . The exact quantity product batch determine follow assessment nutritional characteristic finish product order provide calorie intake two product . Digestibility , fermentability modulation microbiota Buckwheat consider non-cereal addition contain fiber , mineral vitamin , B2 B6 , also represent source antioxidant compound due content flavonoid . The pea flour contains important component human diet ( starch , protein nutrient ) . The health benefit associate consumption pea primarily derive concentration property starch , protein , fiber , vitamin , mineral phytochemical . The fiber contain integument cell wall cotyledon contribute gastrointestinal function . The starch content pea flour characterize low glycemic index . The protein pea may produce peptide antioxidant activity . The vitamin mineral content pea play important role prevention deficiency disease , particular relate deficiency selenium folate . Peas contain variety phytochemical . These include polyphenols may antioxidant anticancer , saponins present hypo colesterolemica anticancer activity , oligosaccharide galactose exert prebiotic benefit large intestine . The nutritional component chestnut flour consist carbohydrate , protein fat composition provide energy value 350-400 kcal / 100 g. Chestnuts vote positive effect metabolism gut bacteria source long-chain fatty acid C18 : 1 C18 : 2 vitamin ( vitamin E ) . The possible presence polyphenols limit outer skin , generally separate fruit production flour . The flour come olive paste describe scientific literature specific nutritional property human diet . However olives integral part Mediterranean diet consume table olive olive oil . The olive fruit contain 50 % water , 22 % fat , 19 % carbohydrates 2 % protein ; polyphenol content varies range 1-3 % . The olive consume olive oil table olive . The olive characterize strong bitterness , cause mostly dall'oleuropein . The oleuropein reach 140 mg / g dry weight unripe olives decrease fruit ripen Table olive treat mitigate bitter taste process maceration soda fermentation brine . However process sweeten bitterness lose important compound present olive polyphenols fiber . There evidence ability extra virgin olive oil polyphenols reduce risk cardiovascular disease , large part possible effect component olive alone synergy polyphenols still unexplored . In addition large part water-soluble fraction contain olive , fiber polyphenols proven beneficial activity human health , remove process oil production . There evidence phenolic fraction secoiridoids poorly absorb intestinal mucosa available colonic microflora . Essentially oil entirety would greatest potential food modulate beneficially composition activity microorganisms symbiotic human gut , observe experimentally types fruit . By mean simulation vitro colonic fermentation observe olive paste , even bake 180°C 30 ' , capable modulate human intestinal microbiota prebiotic effect induce significant increase bifidobacteria . Such simulation vitro carry incubation 24 h batch fermentation system control pH temperature , follow inoculation feces obtain five healthy individual . The analysis total polyphenols ( main antioxidant present test product ) present flour olive , mixture flour test product detect loss total polyphenols , result bake equal 40 % . Clinical Results Clinical result show daily consumption 100 g buckwheat form flour determined increase HDL/cholesterol ratio improve glucose tolerance recently observe consumption biscuit make buckwheat reduced serum level marker inflammation , myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) addition reduction total cholesterol well pulmonary vital capacity . A recent meta-analysis several intervention study human diet supplementation legume , include pea , show ability decrease serum level LDL cholesterol . Intervention study diet olive oil , by-product process olive olive-based product conduct healthy volunteer subject various degree cardiovascular risk . Of study indicate daily dos total polyphenols introduce ( mg / day 30 mg / day , 100 mg / day ) depend type olive oil also enrichment extract . These intervention many case duration month , study measure effect antioxidant anti-inflammatory change circulatory system , along value plasma lipid , parameter relate oxidative stress . In particular study `` EUROLIVE '' , large sample healthy individual , observe phenol olive oil able protect blood lipid oxidation , increase concentration HDL cholesterol relationship reduce oxidized glutathione , however change dell'F2-isoprostane . In 2011 European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) approve claim olive oil polyphenols , especially hydroxytyrosol , protect LDL oxidation , dose great equal 5 mg/kg/day . Other study also show olive oil polyphenols related reduction CRP , reduce atherogenic gene expression blood cell , decrease blood pressure . Although evidence ability olive oil polyphenols reduce risk cardiovascular disease , large part possible effect component olive alone synergy still unexplored . Moreover , large part fiber polyphenols contain olive extracted process oil extraction eliminate byproduct . Rationale Study The buckwheat flour add fiber flavonoid , pea flour contains carbohydrates low glycemic index , protein also source antioxidant , chestnut flour brings prebiotic substance vitamin . Flour olive fruit olive water-soluble component ( eg . Fibers polyphenols ) soluble fraction polyunsaturated monounsaturated fatty acid , tocopherol carotenoid partially pass extra virgin olive . These component design mostly component extra virgin olive oil scientifically give evidence contribute improvement lipid metabolism plasma lipid framework , heart health protect oxidative stress . Based available clinical experimental study , suggest consumption bake product make mixture flour olive paste , buckwheat , peas chestnut positive effect lipid plasma biomarkers intestinal microbiota ( example , increase bifidobacteria ) adult participant plasma content cholesterol medium high level even yet pathological .
