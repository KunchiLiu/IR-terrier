	<brief_title>Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells Clinical Assay Finding Monitoring Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate novel clinical assay ( Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells [ MDSC ] Clinical Assay ) detect cancer associate immune cell peripheral blood patient mean good detect monitor malignant renal cell carcinoma patient . II . Determine mean MDSC level , intra-subject variability , inter-subject variability three group subject variable renal cell carcinoma disease status baseline . III . In patient know localized renal cell carcinoma undergo nephrectomy , determine change MDSC level diagnosis nephrectomy . IV . In patient know metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergo systemic treatment , determine change MDSC level baseline treatment ( 4 month ) , secondarily , compare change change tumor burden evaluate compute tomography ( CT ) scan image modality . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 3 group accord disease status . GROUP I : Patients evidence cancer hematuria undergo collection blood urine sample baseline 2 month analysis via Flow Cytometry MDSC Clinical Assay . GROUP II : Patients diagnose localized renal cell carcinoma undergo collection blood urine sample baseline nephrectomy analysis via Flow Cytometry MDSC Clinical Assay . Patients also undergo CT magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) within 30 day nephrectomy . GROUP III : Patients diagnose metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergo collection sample prior baseline 4 month systemic treatment analysis via Flow Cytometry MDSC Clinical Assay . Patients also undergo CT MRI completion 4 month systemic treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects enrol study must meet one 3 follow criterion : Group 1 : Healthy individual history cancer hematuria Group 2 : Subject diagnosis localize renal cell carcinoma ( image eventual pathology ) schedule undergo nephrectomy Group 3 : Subject diagnosis metastatic renal cell cancer ( image eventual pathology ) schedule begin new systemic therapy Any type renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) ; prior therapy Performance status : 03 Leukocytes &gt; = 3,000/mcL ( frequently use number list example , investigator modify need ) Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/mcL ( frequently use number list example , investigator modify need ) Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent For normal subject arm : evidence cancer hematuria For localized RCC arm : evidence metastatic disease , second cancer , prior chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier For metastatic RCC arm : evidence second cancer , prior chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier For subject : uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited previous current history second malignancy unrelated renal cell carcinoma ; autoimmune disease immune deficiency , chronic treatment immunomodulatory therapy ( e.g . glucocorticoid ) ; significant trauma , surgery , infection past two week psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement</criteria>
