	<brief_summary>ATLANTIS multicenter , phase IIIb , prospective , open-label , randomized trial . The objective study demonstrate superiority strategy anticoagulation apixaban ( Anti-Xa Group ) compare current standard care patient undergone successful TAVI procedure . The randomization stratify accord presence mandatory indication anticoagulation reason TAVI procedure ( e.g . atrial fibrillation DVT/PE ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-Thrombotic Strategy After Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Guidelines antithrombotic therapy TAVI scarce randomize evaluation perform demonstrate optimal antithrombotic strategy . The rate major stroke major bleed DAPT , standard care TAVI ( Class IIb LOE C ) , respectively high 3 % 10 % within first 30 day exclude perioperative period . In addition , rate MACCE estimate 15 % DAPT . However , half senior patient display high on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity , less 1/3 undergo coronary stent implantation prior valve replacement 1/3 display transient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) hospital stay . Anticoagulation appear therefore underused high stroke risk population never evaluate post-TAVI procedure . Non-vitamin K Oral Anticoagulants ( NOAC ) show superiority non-inferiority versus VKA prevent cardio-embolic event consistent reduction intracranial bleeds patient non-valvular AF . Apixaban , direct anti-Xa inhibitor , NOAC demonstrate mortality benefit associate significant reduction embolism major bleed versus VKA . In addition , apixaban NOAC demonstrate superiority aspirin prevent cardio-embolic event similar safety profile non-valvular AF patient contraindication VKA . The investigator therefore formulate hypothesis apixaban superior SOC prevent cardiovascular event post-TAVI procedure . The main purpose demonstrate superiority strategy anticoagulation apixaban 5mg bid ( Anti-Xa Group ) dose adjustment compare current standard care ( SOC Group = VKA Antiplatelet therapy ) measure time randomization first occurrence event composite endpoint death , myocardial infarction , stroke/TIA/systemic embolism , intracardiac bioprosthesis thrombus , episode deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism , life-threatening disabling major bleed one year follow-up define accord VARC2 . Patients underwent clinically successful TAVI procedure . Non-inclusion criterion include recent acute cardiovascular event , mechanical heart valve , necessary use prasugrel ticagrelor ( new P2Y12 inhibitor ) , concomitant medical illness associate reduced survival , end stage renal failure define creatinine clearance &lt; 15mL/min .</detailed_description>
