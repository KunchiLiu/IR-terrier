To study ( compare arm ) kinetic curve free total serum carnitine . Renal replacement therapy rapidly deplete body 's carnitine level . Tracking adequate carnitine level therefore important interpretation study result . D. To constitute bio-bank association study future ancillary study ( e.g . kidney injury marker study , carnitine-responders versus non-responders , exploratory study .</detailed_description>
