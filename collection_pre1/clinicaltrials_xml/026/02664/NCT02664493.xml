	<detailed_description>Background Several study show 30 % transplanted kidney stable function present tubule-interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration protocol biopsy therefore meet criterion acute rejection ( 1 ) . This subclinical rejection ( SCR ) also correlate subsequent chronic allograft nephropathy allograft dysfunction ( 2,3 ) . The Banff 97 work classification renal allograft pathology introduce standardize histological definition acute allograft rejection guide treatment renal transplant recipient ( 4,5 ) . The Banff scheme defines minimal threshold acute T-cell mediate rejection infiltration 25 % renal cortex five mononuclear cell focus tubulitis intimal arteritis ( histological index i2t2 v1 ) refer borderline change insufficient diagnosis acute T-cell mediate rejection , include mild moderate ( &lt; 50 % ) cortical infiltration one four mononuclear cell per tubule cross section ( i1t1 i2t1 ) ( 6 ) . The averaged prevalence borderline SCR 1-2 week 24 % ( range 12-38 % ) , 1-2 month 23 % ( range 21-27 % ) , 2-3 month 23 % ( range 11-41 % ) 1 year 17 % ( range 7-44 % ) select study ( 7 ) . However , pathogenic role limit cortical mononuclear infiltration well establish consensus treat patient borderline change reach . In practice , borderline change graft dysfunction occasionally routinely treat steroid pulse , whereas subclinical borderline change simply 'ignored ' . Particularly , previous study demonstrate case designate borderline histopathology find non-rejection molecular phenotyping ( 8 ) . Furthermore , previous study show risk infection high patient receive high dose steroid ( 9-12 ) , previous study suggest infection risk increase , 1.5-fold , patient receive steroid pulse therapy ( SPT ) acute rejection ( 13 ) . Some previous study reveal graft survival rate treat borderline SCR 99.1 % 1-year , 95.1 % 5-years , 93.7 % 10-years ( 14 ) graft survival rate untreated borderline SCR 90.9 % 1-year ( 15 ) . However , randomize control study effect steroid pulse therapy stable renal transplant recipient subclinical borderline change . Purpose - The reduction risk graft failure pivotal measure effectiveness evaluate immunosuppressive regimen renal transplantation . However , long follow-up period large sample size require endpoint , randomize control trial immunosuppressive therapy mostly rely surrogate endpoint . - In institution , since routine protocol biopsy perform 2 week , 1 year , 2 year renal transplantation , practically difficult graft survival use endpoint randomize controlled trial . - From meta-analysis 31 observational study ( 16 ) , acute rejection associate increase risk graft loss risk ratio range 1.2 - 10.5 . Furthermore , chronic allograft nephropathy graft survival strongly correlate acute rejection episode first year renal transplantation ( 17,18 ) . - Therefore , aim study investigate effect early steroid pulse therapy reduction acute rejection episode first year renal transplantation patient show subclinical borderline change 2-week protocol biopsy . - To evaluate benefit risk , study also investigate effect early steroid pulse therapy opportunistic infection include bacterial , fungal , viral infection .</detailed_description>
