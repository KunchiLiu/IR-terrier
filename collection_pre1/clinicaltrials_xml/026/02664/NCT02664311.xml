	<brief_title>A Randomized Comparison Use JET Conventional Ventilation Pulmonary Vein Isolation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common cardiac arrhythmia United States today . Its incidence increase age , prevalence approach 10 % patient 80 year old . Atrial fibrillation increase risk stroke , patient associate worsened congestive heart failure quality life . Catheter base radiofrequency ablation atrial fibrillation evolve promise technology , provide increased freedom AF improve quality life compare pharmacologic therapy . The technique involve place catheter femoral vein heart , include left atrium . Access leave atrium perform transseptal puncture . Ablation atrial fibrillation perform delivery radiofrequency energy around pulmonary vein order electrically dissociate atrium . This thought eliminate common trigger atrial fibrillation , therefore reduces recurrence AF patient . The ablation procedure do general anesthesia take 4-8 hour . The first part procedure involve create computer generate three dimensional model leave atrium . Once model create patient movement disrupt accuracy interfere physician 's ability accurately locate catheter within atrium . The success AF ablation dependent upon creation accurate three dimensional model , well physicians ability perform durable lesion achieve effective isolation pulmonary vein . Among barrier technical success patient 's respiratory movement , impair catheter stability ability maintain stable catheter position atrium heart ablation . Thus , minimize respiratory movement procedure critical procedural outcome . High frequency jet ventilation ( HFJV ) new mode ventilation rely small tidal volume deliver high frequency ( approximately 80-120 breaths/minute ) . Initially develop critical care set , HFJV produce less respiratory motion due small tidal volume deliver . HFJV use successfully procedures require increased stability field interest , lithotripsy percutaneous hepatic renal radiofrequency ablation well stereotactic high single-dose irradiation stage I non-small cell lung cancer lung metastasis . The initial report use HFJV radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) atrial fibrillation Goode et al 2006 . In retrospective analysis , use HFJV associate decrease number ablation lesion , due decrease number attempt abort catheter dislodgement , well decrease variation size leave atrium ( LA ) due change pulmonary pressure associate conventional ventilation . The incidence complication significantly different HFJV conventionally ventilate patient . More recently , Elkassabany et al . retrospectively review institutional experience Jet ventilation , find procedure could perform safely . HFJV increasingly use may improve procedure efficacy safety , may cost effective . Data however limit small series retrospective review . In order well compare efficacy safety HFJV conventional ventilation , investigator propose conduct prospective randomize study compare use HJFV conventional ventilation patient undergoing pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) institution . Our hypothesis HFJV , allow great catheter stability accurate mapping leave atrium allow effective radiofrequency lesion creation , lead quicker procedure , require few lesion less ablation fluoroscopy time effective isolation pulmonary vein well short long term control AF .</detailed_description>
