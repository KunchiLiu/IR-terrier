	<brief_summary>Recently , medical community learn damage knee joint may one many possible reason pain knee osteoarthritis . Psychological factor aspect brain function seem play important role pain experience . Although research study examine factor individual basis , study examine factor population . Furthermore , measure brain function- perception painful body part- yet examine knee osteoarthritis . The investigator plan study many variable group people knee osteoarthritis , well healthy control ( without knee pain ) , order establish relative importance measure contribute pain , well validate new measure perception people knee osteoarthritis . We also plan use statistical tool- know latent profile analysis- look subgroup knee osteoarthritis pain . The hypothesis different people experience pain knee osteoarthritis different reason . This study first study use different variables- reproduce clinical setting- look different subgroup knee osteoarthritis pain . Ultimately , goal help clinician well prioritize target intervention individual patient . The investigator believe lead well outcomes few treatment complication currently associate pharmaceutical surgical intervention widely use treat knee osteoarthritis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Phenotypes Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2011 statement Food Drug Administration , Osteoarthritis Research Society International ( OARSI ) identify `` phenotyping '' OA pain research priority `` good target pain therapy individual patient . '' Successful identification pain phenotype allow new intervention test homogeneous population patient present similar pain pathophysiology , ultimately enhance treatment effect define population intervention determine safe effective . Clinical population knee OA clearly heterogeneous , span wide age range encompass patient wide variety functional ability . The pain experience knee OA may similarly individualize complex ; patient may present pain appear attributable classic sign joint damage , others may present pain due psychological distress central mechanism . Changes somatosensory processing pain threshold also know occur age . However , scientific community yet examine variable concurrently study population . Therefore , relative importance measure determine pain severity across lifespan unknown . It also unknown whether variable ( interaction variable ) representative different pain phenotype knee OA . This important yet unresolved question ; patient high level psychological distress low level joint damage may warrant different intervention strategy traditional knee-directed approach . On hand , someone increase psychological distress addition severe joint damage may benefit traditional intervention augment impairment-specific intervention . This sort target approach topic current research chronic pain population , similar conceptual model , composed peripheral , psychological central component pain experience ( among others ) , recognize .</detailed_description>
