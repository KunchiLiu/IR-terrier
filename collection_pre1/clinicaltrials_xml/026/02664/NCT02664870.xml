	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis condition cause joint human body deteriorate time . This condition affect 250 million people around globe . Currently , goal treat osteoarthritis involve reduce severity pain result disease . The ultimate goal study identify patient pre-arthritic joint ( symptoms disease characteristic appear ) effort find use treatment stop slow disease . Joints fill naturally occur liquid know synovial fluid . Molecules ( biomarkers ) genetic expression various cell type within synovial joint fluid may serve measure onset progression osteoarthritis . These sample potential improve diagnosis , classification , treatment , possibly change natural history debilitate disease . The purpose study develop collection synovial fluid sample shoulder , hip knee analysis biomarkers cellular genetic component therein well understand pre-arthritic joint , progression disease , response intervention .</brief_summary>
