	<brief_summary>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) experience fatigue exercise intolerance . Increased oxidative stress CKD may contribute factor . The role impaired muscle blood flow regulation fully explore . The investigator hypothesize functional sympatholysis exaggerate CKD associate increase oxidative stress . The investigator also hypothesize exercise training improve functional sympatholysis oxidative stress</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Progressive muscle weakness premature fatigue characterize condition chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) debilitating . Mechanisms underlying exercise intolerance CKD completely understand . Previous study demonstrate impaired skeletal muscle vasodilation exercise CKD patient , may contribute exercise intolerance . Normally , blunt sympathetic mediate vasoconstriction exercise muscle allow steady blood supply exercise muscle . This phenomenon call functional sympatholysis . Functional sympatholysis impair increase reactive oxygen specie may impair CKD . Experiments perform 2 group subject 1 ) Normal kidney function ( eGFR &gt; 90 ) 2 ) Stage 2-3 CKD ( eGFR 30-89 ) . VAsoactive medication hold 72 hour study . All participant attend baseline study visit , include physical examination , medical history review , vital sign measurement , blood collection . Muscle nerve activity muscle oxygenation measure subject perform hand grip exercise 30 % maximum voluntary contraction without low body negative pressure ( - 20 mmHg ) . Muscle blood flow measure hand grip exercise . CKD subject randomize exercise training ( squeeze tennis ball repeatedly least 30 min/day ) exercise train 28 day . Procedures baseline visit repeat follow cross alternate group 28 day follow repeat baseline procedure . Blood flow , muscle oxygenation muscle nerve activity compare CKD normal subject well exercise train CKD subject .</detailed_description>
