	<detailed_description>- All site monitor randomly every year . Trained monitor designate monitor process , compliance enrollment criterion accuracy original data visit every site . - In order make sure accuracy data collect , make restriction ( range format ) remind function electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) . - Detail information variable pre-defined . Staffs train data entry . - Standard Operating Procedures : Case data collect printed Case Report Form ( CRF ) enter web-based data center ( http : //103.31.202.60/subFW/ ) . Hospitals complete eCRF would send printed CRF data center . Trained clinician staff ask enter data web-based eCRF . Following variable include database : ( ) demography characteristic patient : age , gender , medical history , life style , precipitate factor HF , laboratory test , ECG , chest X-ray comorbidities diagnose discharge . Physical examination , echocardiography , laboratory test perform admission discharge ; ( ii ) Heart failure management include pharmacological treatment ( admission , hospitalization discharge ) , nonpharmacological treatment ( include coronary revascularization , implantable cardioverter-defibrillator , cardiac resynchronization therapy , pacemaker , surgical transcatheter valvular therapy , electrical conversion , intra aortic balloon pump , continuous renal replacement therapy , invasive mechanical ventilation ) .The causes in-hospital death include sudden death , cardiac death non-cardiac death . All patient follow discharge outpatient department , via electronic hospital record , conversation patient patient ' family telephone . Outcomes post-discharge included death ( sudden death , cardiac death non-cardiac death ) , rehospitalization heart failure deterioration , acute coronary syndrome , cardiac shock , syncope , cardiac transplantation record enter web-based database . Information physical examination , laboratory test , ECG , chest X-ray , echocardiography , cost use medication collect follow-up visit . - Sample size : A total 15000 patient heart failure plan recruit hospital base classification economic-geographic region China , minimum number patient expect enroll accord number hospitalize case hospital . By September 2015 , data 13687 patient collect . - Plan miss data : Validated data use describe clinical characteristic treatment patient without consider miss . As September 2015 , miss data variable account 10 % patient ( n = 13687 ) . Furthermore , variable obtain multiple Logistic regression model ( 10318 ) death three quarter ( 75.4 % ) patient . Simple multiple imputation method use study large number patient validated analysis . - Statistical analysis plan : Clinical characteristic , treatment , outcomes describe use mean ± standard deviation interquartile range ( IQR ) continuous variable , absolute number percentages categorical variable . The comparison subgroup perform Student t-test ANOVA symmetrical continuous , Mann-Whitney U Kruskal-Wallis H test nonsymmetric continuous , χ2 test categorical variable . Logistic regression use select potential risk factor outcomes . Candidate variable associate mortality univariable Logistic regression analysis ( P ≤ 0.20 ) proceed multivariable analysis . Variables significant P value ( P &lt; 0.05 ) retain final multivariable model . Logarithmic transformation perform normalize distribution variable skew distribution . All P value less 0.05 two-sided test accept statistically significant .</detailed_description>
