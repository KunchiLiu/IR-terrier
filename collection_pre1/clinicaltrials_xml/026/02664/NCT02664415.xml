	<brief_title>Safety Therapeutic Efficacy VRC01 Antibody Patients Who Initiated Antiretroviral Therapy During Early Acute HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human monoclonal antibody ( mAbs ) may potential treat HIV infection prevent spread virus . This study evaluate experimental mAb know VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB ( VRC01 ) . The purpose study evaluate safety therapeutic efficacy VRC01 , administer analytic treatment interruption ( ATI ) , adult begin antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) early acute HIV infection . The study enroll participant RV 254 study diagnose early acute HIV infection ART . At study entry , participant stop take antiretroviral ( ARV ) medication . They randomly assign receive intravenous ( IV ) infusion VRC01 placebo Weeks 0 ( study entry ) , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 . For 7 day follow infusion , participant ask record report symptom study researcher . In addition infusion visit , participant attend follow-up visit 48 week . Study visit may include physical examination , blood collection , urine collection . Neurocognitive test take place select study visit . Some participant may take part optional study procedure include mucosal secretion collection , MRI brain scan , colon biopsy , lymph node biopsy , leukapheresis , lumbar puncture . Study staff monitor participant ' HIV throughout study , participant end participation study restart ARV medication , need .</detailed_description>
