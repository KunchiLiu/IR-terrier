	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To assess safety cohort patient fixed-dose combination pill capecitabine cyclophosphamide administer flat dose metronomic schedule ( define continuous daily treatment without interruption ) patient metastatic breast cancer . - To assess pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) bioavailability fixed-dose combination pill capecitabine cyclophosphamide administer different doses/regimens metronomic schedule patient metastatic breast cancer . Secondary Objectives : - To assess antitumor activity fixed-dose combination pill capecitabine cyclophosphamide administer different doses/regimens metronomic schedule patient metastatic breast cancer give 3 different dos schedule ( regimen 1=standard dose twice daily [ BID ] , regimen 2=full dose daily [ OD ] , regimen 3=low dose [ OD ] ) - Disease Control Rate ( DCR ) - Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) - Time Progression ( TTP ) use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion ( version 1.1 ) . - To evaluate compliance treatment . - To describe evolution toxicity . - To assess safety along patient 's treatment .</brief_summary>
