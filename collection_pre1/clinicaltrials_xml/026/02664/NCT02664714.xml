Methods : Randomized control study do January December 2016 , Laboratory Women 's Health Research , Federal University São Carlos-SP , Brazil . Inclusion criterion : woman stress UI , old 18 year old . The sample size calculation perform use GPower Software ( 3.1.5 , Germany ) estimate sample 30 woman group . The volunteer assess intervention urinary symptom evaluation form , King 's Health Questionnaire , miccional diary , PERFECT scheme perineometry . After evaluation perform randomization volunteer blind investigator volunteer allocate three group : Group 1 : Individualized Training Group 2 : Individualized train progression group train Group 3 : Group train For group use protocol prepare accord recommendation American College Sports Medicine . Later , volunteer reassess 12 treatment , three month six month ( discharge date ) . It add reassessment Self-efficacy Scale Pelvic Floor Exercises Practice . Primary outcome : severity measure King 's Health Questionnaire . Secondary outcome : miccional diary , PERFECT scheme , perineometry Self-efficacy scale Pelvic Floor Exercises Practice . Data normality test Shapiro-Wilk test ( SPSS 19.0 ) . The comparison evaluation perform ANOVA , comparison group perform Student t-test ( independent measure ) . In order measure practical significance data , effect size confidence interval ( CI ) calculate . A 5 % significance level assume . This study approve Research Ethics Committee Federal University São Carlos , São Carlos- SP , Brazil ( Protocol 1207393 ) .</brief_summary>
