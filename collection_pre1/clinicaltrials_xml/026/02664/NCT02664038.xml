	<brief_summary>Alcohol Use Disorders ( AUDs ) significant public health impact highly prevalent Veterans . Alcohol related brain effect neurocognition ( attention , memory executive function ) reduce ability benefit current treatment . These cognitive impairment especially common early phase recovery , persist year get bad age . Recent research suggest cognitive remediation therapy ( CRT ) may improve attention , memory executive function disorder , investigator complete pilot study AUD Veterans find significantly great improvement receive CRT . The propose study examine AUD outcomes neurocognitive improvement CRT combine standardized alcohol treatment . The investigator hypothesize CRT improve neurocognition AUD outcomes standardized alcohol treatment alone . Findings determine whether CRT augmentation benefit Veterans AUDs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim determine whether combine intervention cognitive remediation therapy ( CRT ) Individual Drug Counseling ( IDC ) benefit old Veterans initial phase alcohol abuse treatment improve abstinence outcome neurocognition . Substantial cognitive impairment associate alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) , become bad year use age process . In particular , Veterans enter treatment AUD display cognitive deficit may reduce ability benefit treatment . While considerable variety severity type cognitive impairment find newly recover patient , problem attention , learn memory executive function common . Since treatment require individual able sustain attention , remember learn , apply recovery , impair underlying cognitive process make successful treatment less likely . Moreover , problem executive function pre-frontal cognitive process associate decreased treatment retention poorer AUD treatment outcomes . Although cognition improve sustain abstinence , early phase recovery , cognition impair , patient receive intensive treatment . AUD major cause suffer functional disability old Veterans common co-morbidity physical mental disorder . Finding effective treatment AUD remain priority VA healthcare . The purpose propose study learn whether CRT plus IDC , evidence-based outpatient AUD treatment effective Game-Play Placebo plus IDC . Game-Play Placebo use provide equipoise condition CRT study current CRT study mTBI Veterans fund DoD conduct PI . The current study randomize control trial ( RCT ) target enrollment 90 Veterans initial phase AUD treatment . The study sufficiently power allow u fulfill follow aim test related hypothesis : Specific Primary Aim # 1 : To determine CRT+IDC effective Game-Play Placebo +IDC decrease alcohol use old Veterans 3 month active intervention period . Ho1 : CRT+IDC effective Game-Play Placebo+IDC reduce heavy drinking day decrease day use measure Breathalyzer Timeline Follow-back Method ( TLFB ) 90 day active intervention . Secondary Aim # 1 : To determine CRT+IDC effective Game-Play Placebo+ IDC sustain decrease alcohol use old Veterans end 6 month ( 3 month active intervention period ) . Ho2 : CRT+IDC effective Game-Play Placebo+IDC reduce heavy drinking day decrease day use measure Breathalyzer Timeline Follow-back Method ( TLFB ) 30 day precede 6 month follow-up . Secondary Aim # 2 : To determine combination CRT IDC effective game play placebo IDC improve neurocognitive functioning . Ho3 : Veterans receive CRT+IDC show great improvement Veterans receive Game-Play Placebo+IDC 3 month follow-up global index neurocognitive function , index work memory index executive function . Ho4 : Differential improvement neurocognitive function sustain 6 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
