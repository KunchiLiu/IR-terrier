	<brief_title>Short Forearm Casting Versus Below-elbow Splinting Acute Immobilization Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives ( include primary secondary objective ) To determine success sugar tong splint versus short arm casting maintenance reduction close distal radius fracture compare functional outcome patient treat sugar tong splint versus short forearm cast guidance immediate post-reduction immobilization fracture . Primary objective : Background ( briefly describe pre-clinical clinical data , current experience procedure , drug device , relevant information justify research ) - Koval et al . randomized patient long-arm versus short-arm splint post-reduction close distal radius fracture report comparable maintenance reduction well functional score patient immobilized short-arm splint thus recommend method immediate post-reduction immobilization close distal radius fracture ( Bong et al . 2006 ) . - Grafstein et al . randomize 101 adult patient close distal radius fracture sugar tong splint versus above-elbow circumferential cast versus above-elbow volar-dorsal splint immediate post-reduction immobilization follow patient closely 3 4 week . They report significant difference loss reduction , pain score , range motion , Activities Daily Living ( ADLs ) three method immobilization thus recommend treatment method treat physician comfortable ( Grafstein et al. , 2010 ) . - Millet Rushton randomize 99 woman close distal radius fracture elbow plaster cast versus initial plaster casting follow flexible casting allow early joint range motion report increased comfort , grip score joint mobility early treatment period without negative effect early motion thus conclude early mobilization beneficial treatment option ( Millet Rushton , 1995 ) . - Pool prospectively study range motion radiographic parameter two year period 200 patient Colles ' fracture treat five different combination above- below-elbow immobilization conclude patient go onto union adequate function , immobilize above-elbow plaster lose degree supination . He find benefit above-elbow immobilization recommend below-elbow post-reduction immobilization ( Pool , 1973 ) . - Sarmiento review case series 44 patient intra-articular distal radius fracture treat initially above-elbow cast initially transition early brace allow elbow wrist range motion restrict pronation-supination conclude although fracture collapse occur , functional result good early mobilization reduce stiffness incapacitation associate treatment distal radius fracture ( Sarmiento et al . ) Study Procedures 1 . Study design , include sequence timing study procedure ( distinguish research procedure part routine care ) . 2 . Study duration number study visit require research participant . 3 . Blinding , include justification blind blind trial , applicable . 4 . Justification participant receive routine care current therapy stop . 5 . Justification inclusion placebo non-treatment group . 6 . Definition treatment failure participant removal criterion . 7 . Description happen participant receive therapy study end participant 's participation study end prematurely . - Prospective , randomize , control trial - One hundred twenty adult patient close fracture distal radius randomize below-elbow , sugar-tong splint versus short arm casting immediate post-reduction immobilization . - Residents undergo teach session specifically instruction sugar tong splint versus short arm casting . On-call resident access electronic folder contain randomization patient sugar tong splint versus bi-valved short arm cast . All reduction perform local hematoma block 1 % lidocaine traction less three attempt reduction . - Patients follow one , two four week repeat Anteroposterior ( AP ) lateral radiograph forearm measure radiographic parameter determine maintenance reduction complete Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand Score ( DASH ) functional score upper extremity two week . - Maintenance reduction , define , compare splint construct overall stable versus unstable fracture immobilization group . Specific change radial height , radial inclination volar tilt continuous variable also compare , DASH score measure functionality . - Maintenance reduction define : loss reduction &lt; 2 mm radial height , &lt; 5 degree radial inclination &lt; 10 degree volar tilt and/or &lt; 2 mm intra-articular step , follow radiograph compare immediate post-reduction radiograph ( Bong et al. , 2006 ) . - Unstable fracture define , injury : &gt; 4 mm radial shortening , &gt; 10 degree dorsal tilt , radial-ulnar translation radius &gt; 2 mm , dorsal comminution &gt; 50 % diameter radius , &gt; 2mm intra-articular displacement ( Bong et al. , 2006 ; Stoffelen Broos , 1998 ) . Fractures meet criterion undergo open reduction , internal fixation ( ORIF ) reduction later time . However , reduction parameter maintenance reduction evaluate compare splint technique ORIF . Study Statistics 1 . Primary outcome variable . 2 . Secondary outcome variable . 3 . Statistical plan include sample size justification interim data analysis . 4 . Early stopping rule . Primary outcome variable : Maintenance reduction Secondary outcome variable : DASH score , Radiographic parameter analyze individually : radial height , radial inclination , volar tilt Statistical plan include sample size : Sample size calculate base standard deviation above-noted outcome variable report literature select sample size base large calculated sample size . This increase 167 200 account expect dropout . Early stopping rule : Less 50 % patient follow-up . Risks 1 . Medical risk , listing procedure , major minor risk expect frequency . 2 . Steps take minimize risk . 3 . Plan report unanticipated problem study deviation . 4 . Legal risk risk would associate breach confidentiality . 5 . Financial risk participant . - No medical risk outside standard care . - Patients treated standard care . - Research committee Department Orthopaedic Surgery follow progress project . - No legal risk . - No financial risk . Benefits . Description probable benefit participant society . Below-elbow splint associate decreased morbidity</detailed_description>
