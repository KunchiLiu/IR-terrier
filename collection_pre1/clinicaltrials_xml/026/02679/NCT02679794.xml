	<detailed_description>The 2010 Dietary Guidelines Americans emphasize consumption 4.5 cup fruit vegetable daily . However , US adult consume average 2.6 cups fruit vegetable daily . This low consumption may result limited availability fat soluble , health-promoting , phytochemical carotenoid ( CAT ) food . Dietary CAT beneficial biological property include antioxidant anti-inflammatory effect scientific research support protective effect CAT many degenerative disease , include cardiovascular disease , age-related macular degeneration , type cancer . Therefore , either low intake inefficient bioavailability CAT fruit vegetable may reduce potential effectiveness retard prevent disease . Recently complete randomized crossover study find co-consuming 150g ( 3 egg ) scramble whole egg ( SWE ) contains18g lipid , increase overall CAT absorption mixed-vegetable salad &gt; 7-fold compare salad without egg ( 3g co-consumed lipid ) young healthy men . However , occurrence benefit woman old adult unknown . Aging may affect CAT bioavailability due age-induced physiological change include reduce gastrointestinal tract function modification chylomicron metabolism . Eggs know highly bioavailable source CAT , presumably due presence lipid phospholipid egg yolk . The highly bioavailable nature CAT egg suggest egg-derived factor may leverage improve bioavailability CAT find co-consumed vegetable . While promise , limited data exist impact co-consumed food source lipid enhance CAT absorption woman old adult . Vitamin D ( VIT D ) insufficiency widespread nearly 2/3 Americans meet current Institute Medicine ( IOM ) recommendation serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) concentration . VIT D essential function regulate calcium homeostasis , include stimulate calcium 's active intestinal absorption renal excretion . Thus , maintain adequate VIT D status critical overall skeletal health prevention osteoporosis . Post-menopausal woman high risk osteoporosis risk reduce adequate VIT D status maintain . VIT D fat-soluble limited number food naturally contain . Also , VIT D absorption enhance dietary lipid , optimal amount lipid require maximal absorption determine . A paucity data exists regard effect co-consumed food source lipid enhance VIT D absorption impact age VIT D bioavailability woman .</detailed_description>
