	<detailed_description>This trial two-step , sequential design , continuation second part trial dependent positive result first part . In Part One trial , investigator compare intrapatient variability fDM perform two timepoints prior chemotherapy ( chemotherapy choose treat physician assign part study ) , change fDM approximately one week dose chemotherapy , establish treatment-related change fDM occur clinical setting . If positive result Part One , investigator proceed second half trial . In Part Two , investigator examine change fDM occur one week type chemotherapy administer , compare pathologic response , radiological response , clinical response .</detailed_description>
