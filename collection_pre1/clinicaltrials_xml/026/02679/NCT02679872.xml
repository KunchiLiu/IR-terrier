	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Non-technical skill ( NTS ) define 'the cognitive , social personal resource skill complement technical skill , contribute safe efficient task performance ' . Human error , communication breakdown , lack speaking good leadership , know contribute considerably adverse event . Adverse event common operate theatre affect patient safety . Adaptive behaviour show important response dynamic , complex world operate theatre prevent potential problem adverse event . As technical skill , NTS teach team training . Team train show improve attitude well NTS , reduce technical error . Large study additionally show team training reduce adverse event improve patient outcome . A training intervention target operate theatre team need start assessment uncover learn need team member . In general minimally invasive surgery ( MIS ) show complex , involve personnel take long time open surgery . The technical skill different , among thing due complex equipment two-dimensional vision three-dimensional operating space . In systematic review ( submit ) , study investigate NTS MIS team . The communication MIS compare open surgery find different , relate equipment patient relate topic . Working fixed team improve teamwork climate MIS team . Correspondingly , NTS video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) operating team speculate differ NTS need open surgery case technical skill . However , study investigate NTS VATS team . The aim study explore , NTS member VATS team perceive important high quality patient care patient safety . METHODS : Frameworks/theory : The theoretical conceptual framework study safety theory Erik Hollnagel , name Safety-I Safety-II , argue new view safety : Safety-II . In Safety-I , ontology thing either function malfunction , could piece equipment healthcare professional follow procedure guideline . Consequently , aetiology outcome explain cause-effect relationship , malfunction thing linearly cause unwanted effect . The result phenomenology refers outcomes adverse event / incidents/ accident . Oppositely , Safety-II , ontology socio-technical system , healthcare system , performance adjustment need adjust work , task tool , actual situation complex world . Hence , technology vary limit extent , human performance need vary . The aetiological explanation Safety-II therefore , performance variability resonate proactive reactive adjustment observe outcome , name emergent outcome . The result phenomenology see performance variability basis adverse event acceptable outcome ; everyday activity . These performance adjustment categorise three type adjustment : Maintaining/creating , compensate avoiding , thereby characterise performance variability specific activity . In , start point turn around . In Safety-II , focus thing go right aim understanding everyday activity , term 'Work-as-Done ' , contrast less interesting write procedure guideline etc. , term 'Work-as-Imagined ' . Within non-technical skill research education healthcare , especially within speciality work operating theatre , taxonomy widely use framework behavioural marker adapt aviation industry , term Oxford Non-Technical Skills ( NOTECHS ) system . This framework structure around four category , divide several element represent example good poor behavioural marker . This system develop evaluate operate team assess team subteam 's NTS . In study , taxonomy NOTECHS system perspective conceptual theory Safety-II use framework data analysis describe detail . In , behavioural marker represent good behaviour therefore focus study explore thing go right much often case . Interviewing actual VATS team member explore perception NTS use everyday activity include need adaption situational requirement , find others . This represent 'Work-as-Done ' rather 'Work-as-Imagined ' aim inform Safety-II perspective patient safety . Design : The study use theory describe explorative semi-structured interview study . The data collection thereby sample size iterative process new data reveal , hence saturation meet . This include interview multi-professional team individual depend data reveal interviewing-analysing process . Interviews conduct KG ASM use semi-structured interview guide . The interview guide adjust iterative process interview analysis . All interview audio-recorded transcribed verbatim . The study report accordance Standards Reporting Qualitative Research ( SRQR ) . Quality rigour aim suggest qualitative research . Ethics : The Regional Scientific Ethics Committee Capital Region apply ; however , expect letter exemption due Danish law educational study involve patient . Participants receive oral write information give inform consent continuous option retract consent participation . Personal data store accord Danish Data Protection Law , present anonymously . The study protocol register www.clinicaltrials.gov . Participants , set time : Participants purposefully sample subject matter expert term VATS operate team conjunction individual . The team consist one two surgeon ( ) VATS experience , one young assist surgeon , one anaesthesiologist , one nurse anaesthetist , one two scrub nurse experience assist circulate nurse . The individual relevant healthcare professional . Participants come four university hospital perform VATS Denmark collaboration head department . Each person include one team interview and/or one individual interview . The interview plan conducted February March 2016 . The interview guide : The interview guide semi-structured scripted introduction interview set scene topic interview . The interview try explore four NOTECHS category , namely leadership &amp; management , teamwork &amp; co-operation , problem-solving &amp; decision-making , situation awareness Safety-II perspective , focus performance variability team member need daily work adapt situational requirement . Emphasis lay allow team member give perspective order explore view entire team . The interview semi-structured probe question use necessary obtain additional information . Prior conduct interview , two author ( KG , ASM ) spend number hour observe VATS procedure order become familiar procedure critical phase operation . This , along input experience VATS surgeon ( RHP , HJH ) experience anaesthesiologist ( DO ) , inform interview guide . The interview guide internally review author consist surgeon , scrub nurse anaesthesiologist experience qualitative NTS researcher . It pilot test healthcare professional without specific NTS knowledge avoid misunderstand misinterpretation ; however , data include study . Data collection analysis : The interview conduct face-to-face undisturbed room relation operate theatre normal working hour depend work schedule . The participant demographic data collect consist profession , age , gender , year clinical experience , year type experience laparoscopic VATS procedures previous experience NTS training . A deductive data analysis strategy apply study . With taxonomy NOTECHS framework use direct content analysis analyse interview . Directed content analysis apply 'prior research exist phenomenon incomplete/would benefit description ' . As approach topic Safety-II perspective , focus behaviour VATS team member perceive important insuring thing go right thereby insure high quality patient care patient safety . Explicitly focus performance variability everyday work , categorise either maintaining/creating , compensate avoid . The strategy use category NOTECHS well categories performance variability , read transcribe interview . The text cod category condensation , add new one extra text interest uncover order avoid miss important new information could inform theory NTS VATS team . The text cod mark adhere one category , introduce new category need . The text paraphrase condense interview quotation observable behavioural example . The analysis conduct KG ASM . The first interview cod KG ASM ; cod discuss two LS/DO . When agreement satisfactorily , two author split code remain interview independently . The result cod discussed LS/DO later full group author . The analysis conduct use NVivo ( version 10 ) . Acknowledgements : The author like thanks participate cardiothoracic department Denmark . PROJECT ORGANISATION : This study conduct Copenhagen Academy Medical Education Simulation ( CAMES ) , Rigshospitalet , Capital Region Denmark Copenhagen University .
