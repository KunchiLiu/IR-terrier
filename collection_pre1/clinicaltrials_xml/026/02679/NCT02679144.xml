	<criteria>All patient must pathologically confirm diagnosis neuroblastoma , &lt; 30.99 year age classify high risk time diagnosis . Exception : patient initially diagnose nonhighrisk neuroblastoma , later convert ( and/or relapse ) high risk neuroblastoma also eligible . All patient must complete remission ( CR ) : 1 . No evidence residual disease scan 2 . No evidence disease metastatic bone marrow . Specific Criteria Stratum : Stratum 1 : All patient must complete standard upfront therapy replicates treatment patient enrol ANBL0032 receive , include : intensive induction chemotherapy ( feasible ) resection primary tumor , follow : consolidation highdose chemotherapy stem cell transplant radiotherapy , follow : immunotherapy Ch14.18/IL2/GMCSF ( dinutuximab ) retinoic acid ; . All subject Stratum 1 must also meet follow criterion : • A pretransplant disease status evaluation meet International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria ( INRC ) CR ( complete response ) , VGPR ( good partial response ) , PR ( partial response ) primary site , soft tissue metastases bone metastasis . Patients meet criterion must also meet protocolspecified criterion bone marrow response prior transplant outline : No 10 % tumor involvement ( base total nucleated cellular content ) see specimen bilateral bone marrow aspirate/biopsy . Stratum 2 : Neuroblastoma first complete remission follow standard upfront therapy different describe Stratum 1 . Stratum 3 : Neuroblastoma fail response least PR follow induction chemotherapy surgical resection primary tumor , achieve CR follow additional therapy . Stratum 4 : Patients achieve second subsequent CR follow relapse ( ) . Preenrollment tumor survey : Prior enrollment study , determination mandatory disease stag must perform : Tumor image study include Bilateral bone marrow aspirate biopsy This disease assessment require eligibility preferably do within 2 week prior enrollment , must do within maximum 4 week enrollment . Timing prior therapy : Stratum 1 : Enrollment later 60 day completion upfront therapy , ( last dose cisretinoic acid ) maximum 6 cycle cisretinoic acid maintenance therapy . Stratum 2 , 3 4 : Enrollment later 60 day last dose recent therapy . Patients must Lansky Karnofsky Performance Scale score &gt; 50 % patient must life expectancy ≥ 2 month .
