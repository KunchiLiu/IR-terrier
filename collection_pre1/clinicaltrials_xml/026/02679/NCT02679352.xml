	<brief_summary>Shoulder arthroplasty reliable procedure treatment severe shoulder joint disease relieve pain restore shoulder function . Shoulder implant commonly use characterised humeral stem complication related stem infrequent . These include : bone stock loss , intraoperative postoperative break around implant , malpositioning humeral component difficult eradication infection inside bone around implant . With aim reduce stem-related complication , novel prosthesis characterise stem-less design develop . The objective study therefore explore well people recover shoulder replacement novel stem-less shoulder prosthesis . This assess 5 year three different country Europe use patient complete questionnaire clinical radiographic assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SMR Stemless Shoulder Arthroplasty Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis base study SMR stemless system might contribute ensure good clinical outcome effective stability might avoid potential complication associate traditional stem implant . The aim study assess clinical , radiographic subjective outcome anatomic reverse shoulder arthroplasty SMR stemless prosthesis , define survivorship implant identify possible risk factor may lead failure . This post-marketing clinical study , study device register , CE mark use accord intend use . It international , multi-centre , prospective case series . The assignment patient involve study determine aetiology preoperatively evaluate Investigator fall within current practice . The decision use specific prosthesis design decide Investigators independently clearly separated decision include patient study . The evaluation internal control assessment post-surgery data compare baseline measurement ( pre-operative clinical analysis radiographic analysis discharge ) . It open label . The investigation carry 3 site Europe maximum total number 78 treated patient . Accrual competitive require recruitment target meet . Equal number recruit three centre ( 26 patient per site ) , deviation 8 participant accept ( minimum 18 maximum 34 participant recruit per site ) .</detailed_description>
