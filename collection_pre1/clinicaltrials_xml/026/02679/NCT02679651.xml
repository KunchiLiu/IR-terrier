	<detailed_description>Human foot must bear entire weight body . Feet fat pad plantar surface act shock absorber skin bone . However , repetitive mechanical stress throughout person 's lifetime lead gradual atrophy fat pad . In addition age-related degeneration , fat pad atrophy cause mechanism abnormal foot mechanic , steroid use , collagen vascular disease . Regardless cause , many patient plantar fat pad atrophy experience considerable pain loss function.1 Previous study negatively correlate plantar soft tissue thickness plantar pressure , loss plantar fat fundamental mechanism associate pressure-related foot disorders2,3 . Increased pressure fat pad atrophy commonly manage padded sock , insole , shoe modification . However , extrinsic strategy totally dependent patient compliance , device must replace soon begin break . Another treatment option include silicone injection plantar aspect foot . In one study , patient receive silicone treatment experience increase plantar tissue thickness decrease plantar pressure , cushion property decrease time need additional booster injection ultimately suggested.4,5 Furthermore , silicone know migrate away injection site find inguinal lymph node patients.1 A different strategy gain momentum autologous fat graft foot . Taking patient 's tissue , often abdomen thigh , transplant area plantar fat pad atrophy may reduce pressure natural permanent manner . Only one study date publish autologous fat graft foot , patient receive concurrent surgical procedure fat graft result report subjectively patients.6 In study , hypothesize difference plantar tissue thickness , plantar pressure , pain score patient diagnose plantar fat pad atrophy compare healthy , foot-type matched control . Results measure objectively use ultrasound tissue thickness , optical pedobarograph plantar pressure , Manchester foot pain disability index ( MFPDI ) pain score . Furthermore , predict result help establish criterion fad pad atrophy diagnosis clinic well determine patient would receive great benefit fat graft foot .</detailed_description>
