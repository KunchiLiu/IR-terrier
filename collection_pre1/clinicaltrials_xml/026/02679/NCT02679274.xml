	<brief_title>Cycled Testosterone Therapy Improve Physical Function Frail Nursing Home Residents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Frailty age serious debilitate condition contribute downward spiral health physical function . Many long term nursing home patient enter rehabilitative care program intent increase strength physical independence . However , many patient last functional limitation despite rehabilitation program intend improve physical function sarcopenia frailty common among nursing home resident . Aging general , frailty particular , associate decrease sex hormone , testosterone treatment know anabolic effect muscle hypogonadal well eugonadal male . Effective adjuvant treatment safely employ conjunction exist therapy rehabilitative care intend improve function profound benefit long-term outcome male female patient . The investigator demonstrate administration testosterone ( 100 mg/wk ) start show improvement lean body mass ( LBM ) early 4 week muscle strength 8 week healthy old community dwell male ( Sheffield-Moore et al. , 2011 ) . In study , continuous weekly treatment well intermittent treatment ( 4 week testosterone , 4 week testosterone , etc ) result similar benefit 20 week . In addition , investigator recently complete 10-week study investigator show safety efficacy cycle testosterone treatment ( 100 mg/wk 2 week , alternate 2 week treatment ) combination regular exercise healthy eugonadal adult men confine continuous bed rest ( see preliminary data ) . In study , testosterone robustly increase LBM little 2 week bed rest improvement LBM associate good protection physical function upon reambulation . It propose cycle testosterone paradigm may safe effective adjuvant therapy frail old nursing home patient undergoing physical rehabilitation . The investigator hypothesize testosterone treatment addition standard-of-care ( SOC ) physical therapy rehabilitation result improve muscle mass physical function compare patient receive SOC . The long term goal develop effective treatment functional decline muscle mass strength contribute development progression frailty . Therefore , investigator test specific aim outline old male female resident engage rehabilitation care health care center Texas City Galveston . Men woman ( age 60-up ) recruit enroll rehabilitative care program , screen upon informed consent , eligible , block-randomized ( double-blinded ) receive either testosterone enanthate ( 100 mg/wk male 25 mg/wk female ) placebo ( saline ) treatment 10 week . The treatment follow 2-week cycle ( 2 week on-treatment , 2 week , etc ) . Primary outcome assess use non-invasive method baseline completion study 10 week . These outcome include body composition determine bioelectric impedance analysis ( BIA ) , muscle strength fatigue handgrip dynamometry , physical function short physical performance battery ( SPPB ) , quality life ( QOL ) short battery questionnaire . Blood sample collect screen safety repeat completion study secondary outcome measure ( hormone , lipid profile blood chemistry ) . Specific Aim 1 . Determine effect cycle testosterone treatment body composition male female nursing home resident undergo rehabilitative care . Specific Aim 2 . Determine effect cycle testosterone treatment physical function male female nursing home resident undergo rehabilitative care . Data pilot/feasibility project become foundation development large long-term project solicitation NIH aim elucidate efficacy testosterone treatment physical function independence frail old adult .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male Female 2 . Ages : 60 year old 3 . Starting rehabilitative care 1 . Inability perform functional test specific study protocol 2 . Diagnosed carcinomas breast know suspected carcinoma prostate . 3 . Uncontrolled endocrine metabolic disease ( e.g . liver disease , renal disease , diabetes ) . 4 . Uncontrolled hypertension . Systolic blood pressure =/ &gt; 160mm Hg diastolic blood pressure =/ &gt; 100mm Hg three consecutive measurement take oneweek interval . Testosterone , anabolic steroid glucocorticoid cause fluid retention could worsen uncontrolled hypertension . Subjects include two less blood pressure medication blood pressure criterion . 5 . History significant liver disorder 3fold elevation liver function test ( Alk phos , ALT , AST ) . Testosterone hepatotoxic effect subject use careful monitoring LFTs ( liver function ) , though injection testosterone 100 mg dose typically sufficient negatively affect LFTs . 6 . History angina occurs exertion rest myocardial infarction within last 12 month . 7 . LDL cholesterol great 200 mg/dL testosterone administration may elevate LDL cholesterol level , though anticipated testosterone injection 100 mg/wk . 8 . Hematocrit great 51 % . 9 . Established chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , untreated sleep apnea . 10 . Implanted artificial pacemaker/defibrillator . BIA use small current recommend participant pacemaker . 11 . Diagnosed systemic fungal infection . 12 . Positive screen HIV active hepatitis* . 13 . Use history recent anabolic steroid use ( within 3 month ) . 14 . Alcohol drug abuse . 15 . Any condition event consider exclusionary PI cover faculty physician . 16 . Vulnerable population include : individual unable consent behalf , prisoner pregnant woman . Subjects exclude due positive screening result , include HIV , HBV HCV , immediately schedule counseling followup test need , advise consult primary physician .</criteria>
