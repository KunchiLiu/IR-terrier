	<brief_summary>Accurate assessment fluid responsiveness ( FRes ) central guide fluid management septic critically ill patient . As evidence accumulates inadequate excessive fluid resuscitation associate increased morbidity mortality , simultaneously become increasingly clear current widely use method predict FRes questionable accuracy . The optimal technique predict FRes would non-invasive point-of-care test high degree accuracy , also one require minimal train perform correctly may easily perform repeatedly serial evaluation FRes ongoing management critically ill patient . To date , three major ultrasonographic modality emerge viable candidate bedside assessment FRes : 1 ) measurement dynamic change inferior vena caval diameter ( IVC-CI ) , 2 ) measurement dynamic change peripheral arterial waveform derive variable ( PA Doppler ) , 3 ) echocardiographic measurement dynamic change leave ventricular outflow tract waveform derive variable ( LVOT Doppler ) . In study , investigator perform first direct comparison technique represent three modality prediction FRes non-invasive bioreactance cardiac output monitor ( Cheetah NICOM™ ) , extensively validate gold-standard invasive method cardiac output measurement . The investigator compare accuracy modality spontaneously breathe mechanically ventilate patient use passive leg raise testing ( PLR ) surrogate volume challenge . In addition , investigator also elicit information treat physician ( ) clinical assessment FRes . The investigator recruit adult patient ED ICU sepsis , receive initial bolus 20-30 cc/kg IV fluid , tolerate PLR US procedure . Prior US NICOM measurement , investigator ask attend physician manage patient regard assessment fluid status . Then , separate investigator perform US NICOM measurement independently ensure blind . NICOM data , well validate septic patient , share attend physician . They ask new data change management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This diagnostic accuracy study compare select ultrasound technique well validated standard predict fluid responsiveness septic patient ( NICOM ) . The primary outcome report sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , likelihood ratio , receiver operate characteristic curve . The timeframe measurement within 72 hour subject ' admission . Determination outcome ( i.e. , whether subject fluid responsive ) base upon data generate NICOM device . The NICOM generate data within 5 minute assessment . The ultrasound modality study generate data within 5 minute assessment well . The US data compare NICOM data generate statistic list protocol . There plan follow-up subject . 1 . The investigator compare ability dynamic change inferior vena caval diameter ( IVC-CI ) , dynamic change peripheral arterial waveform derive variable ( PA Doppler ) , dynamic change leave ventricular outflow tract waveform derive variable ( LVOT Doppler ) detect fluid responsiveness ( FRes ) relative FRes assess bioreactance cardiac output monitor passive leg raise ( PLR ) . Hypothesis : PA Doppler LVOT Doppler superior sensitivity specificity predict FRes comparison IVC-CI . 2 . The investigator evaluate data acquisition duration data acquisition failure rate IVC-CI , PA Doppler , LVOT Doppler . Hypothesis : PA Doppler short data acquisition duration comparison LVOT velocity variation IVC-CI . Hypothesis : PA Doppler low data acquisition failure rate comparison LVOT velocity variation IVC-CI . 3 . The investigator compare ability IVC-CI , PA Doppler , LVOT Doppler predict FRes comparison FRes predict clinical judgment . Hypothesis : PA Doppler LVOT Doppler superior sensitivity specificity predict FRes comparison clinical judgment . 4 . The investigator evaluate ability dynamic change PA correct flow time ( cFT ) detect FRes relative FRes assess bioreactance cardiac output monitor PLR . Hypothesis : cFT great sensitivity specificity predict FRes Δflow time threshold ≥15 % PLR . Hypothesis : At Δflow time threshold ≥15 % , cFT superior sensitivity specificity detect FRes comparison IVC-CI .</detailed_description>
