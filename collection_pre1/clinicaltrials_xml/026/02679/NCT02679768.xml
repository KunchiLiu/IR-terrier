	<brief_summary>Very little know depressed patient ' mental state discharge inpatient ward provide sheltered environment stable sleep wake cycle , regular meal , regular physical social activity . Our previous usability study , SAFE I , show electronic self-monitoring useful tool gain insight patient ' condition week discharge . Results show patient four week period significant day day variation self-rated mood sleep schedule patient ' sleep pattern delay 45 minute . In actual study , SAFE II , investigate whether intervention strong focus circadian timing daytime activity , sleep , coin Circadian Reinforcement Therapy ( CRT ) , lead faster recovery depression prevent relapse depression discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electronic Self-monitoring With Closed Loop Feedback Focusing Regulation Sleep-wake Cycle Reduce Relapse Depression After Discharge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SAFE II Background Patients hospitalize depression generally discharge within 4-6 week , remain vulnerable , fully recover discharge , hence majority refer outpatient care . Often , however , patient wait 2 week discharge first visit outpatient clinic . Our clinical experience period discharge start outpatient care associate psychological uncertainty often cause unstable daily routine sleep , meal , social life , exercise . This may result aggravation depression associate risk suicidal thought readmission . Our first study `` E-monitoring depression - Safe I , '' illustrate issue . Patients register state daily electronical application , sleep , mood , exercise . Among thing study show patient ' sleep pattern advance later even longer morning thus shift sleep-wake cycle later . One possible explanation find patient recover depression discharge therefore vulnerable change . Another possible factor home patient support keep daily structure hospitalization . This project `` Safe discharge - SafeII '' base experience first study investigate whether focus intervention benefit stable sleep recovery depression help prevent worsen depression wait time outpatient treatment . It well document stable sleep circadian rhythm important element recovery depression . Aim The purpose examine whether focused guidance improve sleep habit circadian rhythms speed recovery also prevent worsen depression thus prevent readmission . Design Methods All patient hospitalize PCK ( Psychiatric Center Copenhagen ) unipolar depression , refer outpatient treatment Intensive outpatient unit affective disorder ) ( IAA ) discharge , eligible inclusion . Patient agree participate randomize one two group . The standard care group consist patient ask register mental state daily basis ( mood , sleep exercise ) electronical application Daybuilder ( www.Daybuilder.com ) . This standard group weekly telephone contact investigator . The intervention group also ask register daily state Daybuilder app weekly telephone contact investigator . In addition standard care group also receive individual guidance concern importance stabilization sleep-wake cycle sleep recover depression . The primary outcome study change self-rated mood change Hamilton depression rating score baseline endpoint two group number readmission . We expect intervention group rapid recovery depression few readmission . Furthermore , subset patient , level sleep hormone melatonin , biological marker circadian rhythm , measure , profile establish dim light melatonin onset ( DLMO ) start end intervention . At total 150 patient , 75 group include project three year period In study get opportunity see isolated impact focus sleep circadian rhythm recovery depression . We coin intervention Circadian Reinforcement Therapy ( CRT ) . Implications If finding positive , expect implement intervention systematically psychiatric service thereby improve condition patient depression make transition in- outpatient status less risky stable . In long term perspective intervention underpin recovery depression , prevent relapse depression readmission mental hospital .</detailed_description>
