	<brief_summary>Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( rESWT ) previously demonstrate efficient treatment option heel pain associate chronic proximal plantar fasciitis administer three session . The present study test hypothesis heel pain associate chronic proximal plantar fasciitis also treat successfully rESWT two treatment session perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Treatment Chronic Plantar Fasciopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plantar fasciitis , common cause heel pain , account approximately 11-15 % foot symptom present physician . In United States , two million individual treat PF annual basis . The term Plantar Fasciitis imply inflammatory condition suffix 'itis ' . However , various line evidence indicate disorder well classify 'fasciosis ' 'fasciopathy ' . Details etiology , pathogenesis , risk factor , diagnosis general treatment strategy plantar fasciitis provide series comprehensive review recently . Briefly , athletes elderly commonly present physician plantar fasciitis , diagnosis plantar fasciitis usually base patient 's history clinical examination . It recommend literature start treatment plantar fasciitis conservative treatment modality , include physical therapy , stretch , inserts/orthotics etc . For patient respond conservative treatment 6 month ( 10 % 20 % patient ) extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( ESWT ) consider . In case patient benefit ESWT either , surgical intervention take account . Several randomize , control trial ESWT focus shock wave chronic plantar fasciitis publish , demonstrate favourable result range 50 % 70 % followup period three month treatment . Besides , recent study demonstrate safety efficacy radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( rESWT ) chronic plantar fasciitis ( Gerdesmeyer et al. , Am J Sports Med 2008 Nov ; 36 ( 11 ) :2100-9 ) . These author administer rESWT placebo treatment three session , two week ( Â±4 day ) apart evaluate treatment outcome twelve week twelve month first session . The author find statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) difference reduction mean Visual Analog Scale composite score patient treat rESWT placebo-treated patient twelve week twelve month baseline . To evaluate potential rESWT become routine therapeutic modality treatment chronic plantar fasciitis , investigator present study identify follow question address study Gerdesmeyer et al . ( 2008 ) . First , unknown whether treatment success also reach two rESWT session one week apart , rather three rESWT session two week apart apply Gerdesmeyer et al . ( 2008 ) . Anecdotal report colleague Europe indicate could indeed case . Second , immediate return normal daily life activity ( include sport activity ) normal daily shoe wear indicate patient suffer chronic plantar fasciitis treat rESWT experience profound pain relief already much early three month first rESWT session , apply first followup study Gerdesmeyer et al . ( 2008 ) . Therefore hypothesis test present prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study treatment chronic plantar fasciopathy two rESWT session one week apart result profound pain relief compare placebo treatment already four week first rESWT treatment , last least six month .</detailed_description>
