	<brief_summary>An intermittent energy restrict ( IER ) diet may modify cardio-metabolic disease risk factor compare energy-matched continuous energy restrict ( CER ) diet . A randomised control parallel design trial determine impact short-term IER diet ( 2 consecutive day low calorie diet ( VLCD ) , 5 day moderate energy restriction week 4 week period ) , compare CER diet , insulin sensitivity healthy ( disease-free ) subject central obesity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Of An Intermittent Energy Restricted Diet On Insulin Sensitivity In Men Women With Central Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prediabetes rate England show marked increase , triple 2003 2011 . It characterise impaired fasting glucose impair glucose tolerance increase risk progression type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . It estimate approximately 90 % T2D attribute excess weight . Central obesity primary driver increase cardiometabolic risk due lipotoxicity effect , promote proinflammatory state facilitates insulin resistance beta cell dysfunction . A high waist circumference measurement , indicative central obesity , associate increase risk cardiovascular disease T2D , strong predictor T2D BMI . BMI limitation indicator adiposity since n't distinguish lean fat mass , indicate body fat distribution . Conventionally , continuous energy restriction ( CER ) diet use weight loss , consist constant daily energy deficit relative total energy expenditure . The impact weight loss health intermittent energy restriction ( IER ) approach rarely investigate ( although `` 5:2 diet '' popularise lifestyle book aim general public ) . An IER diet consist predefined period time severely restrict energy intake , alternated period great energy intake . This approach show confer metabolic benefit overweight obese woman risk breast cancer baseline BMI 2445 ( Harvie et al. , 2013; Harvie et al. , 2011 ) . Rationale : An IER diet use meal replacement ( VLCD foodpacks use total dietary replacement 2 consecutive day week , food-based energy-restricted diet 5 day week ) may modify cardio-metabolic disease risk factor compare energy-matched CER diet . Research question : In centrally obese subject , assess high waist circumference measurement , adherence IER diet enhance cardio-metabolic benefit compare CER diet ? Hypothesis : Increases insulin sensitivity follow 4 week dietary intervention IER weight loss programme great compare standard CER programme . Objectives : 1 . A randomised control parallel design trial determine impact short-term IER diet compare CER diet primary outcome variable ( insulin sensitivity ) healthy subject high waist circumference . 2 . To assess impact IER diet secondary outcome variable , include body composition , heart rate variability ( HRV , measure cardiac autonomic function , include parasympathetic sympathetic activity ) , blood pressure , vascular function , marker insulin resistance , inflammation/adipokines , plasma lipid profile , plasma norepinephrine , ketosis , gut microbiome cognitive function healthy subject high waist circumference .</detailed_description>
