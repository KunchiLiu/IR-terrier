	<brief_title>Analysis Prostatic Arterial Embolization Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Using Embosphere Microspheres</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study demonstrate safety efficacy device , Embosphere Microspheres , prostatic arterial embolization ( PAE ) . PAE , accept form treatment BPH outside United States , however study perform demonstrate safety efficacy US . Embosphere Microsphere device may use reduce blood flow target organ . With research , would like show Embosphere Microsphere may use patient benign hyperplasia prostate ( BPH reduce blood flow prostate gland . This current study design understand rate improve BPH symptom . Patients moderate severe low urinary tract symptom result BPH eligible study . Specifically , patient conservative medical therapy least 6 month relief symptom ask participate trial . Patients meet criterion would traditionally consider invasive treatment option surgery . We believe PAE acceptable alternative invasive treatment option currently standard care ( available ) therefore ask participate study . We would like demonstrate PAE utilizing Embosphere Microsphere improve symptom . The gold standard treatment BPH transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) . It effective also invasive open surgical procedure carry high risk sexual dysfunction incontinence side effect procedure . It goal study demonstrate complication associate PAE PAE improve symptom associate BPH . Embosphere Microspheres small biocompatible plastic sphere release inside vessel x-ray control . Once inside vessel , spheres block vessel decrease blood flow tissue supply vessel . Embosphere Microspheres clear Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use embolization blood vessel supply uterine fibroid vascular tumor . Additionally , approve European Union treatment BPH . This study approve FDA use Embosphere Microspheres research purpose treatment BPH .</detailed_description>
