	<brief_title>Evaluation Ability Detect Bowel Gas During Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Undetected bowel perforation rare dangerous complication laparoscopic surgery . If injury detect treated time surgical procedure , patient suffer sever complication include septic shock eventually death . Our goal test novel device detect bowel gas leakage perforation alert surgeon operation evaluate gas present insufflated abdomen surgery . During laparoscopic surgery , carbon dioxide insert abdominal cavity order perform operation . This dynamic process insufflation constant entire procedure maintain constant pressure compensate small leak due insertion retrieval instrument . This study determine ability device attach standard Veress needle trocar operation periodically draw small amount gas abdomen evaluate gas accurately detect gaseous content bowel . Before device use detect bowel perforation , first must ensure accurately detect bowel gas insufflate abdomen .</detailed_description>
