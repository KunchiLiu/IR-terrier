The milligram per serve sodium content food assign color-coded green/yellow/red designation accord low/moderate/high identify United States Food Drug Administration 's definition sodium content . Assess patient knowledge food sodium content appropriate consumption low sodium diet implementation intervention calculate average milligrams sodium per serve via choice make simulated grocery store shopping . Evaluate application patient knowledge low-sodium food choice use simulated grocery store shopping intervention calculate average milligrams sodium per serve via choice make use color-coded card .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each new patient refer heart failure ( HF ) clinic ask permission participate project . Each patient enrol project random number assign protect identity , assign baseline data well food tally score sheet intervention . Baseline data collection include patient 's sex , age , marital status , comorbidities , education level . Using guideline Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) Prevention Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) , ensure consistency , participate patient give standard dietary sodium education use voice-over PowerPoint presentation . Approximately two week later , patient ask `` shop '' 15 food item simulate grocery store . This group patient give evidence base intervention use second voice-over PowerPoint presentation . During presentation , participant instruct use color-coded card assist choose food base low/moderate/high sodium content . Green indicate food less 35 mg sodium per serving , yellow indicate food 35-140 mg sodium per serving , red indicate food 140 mg sodium per serve . Approximately two additional week later , patient go `` shopping '' fifteen item simulate grocery store use color-coded card allow patient choose food base low/moderate/high sodium content . The food choice make grocery store encounter analyze total sodium content per serve food divide number food purchase ( fifteen ) obtain average milligram sodium content per serve analyze per patient , compare patient 's pre- post-intervention sodium per serve food choice . The average milligram sodium per serve compare patient pre- post-color-coded card use . The average milligrams sodium per serve patient together total use color-coded card use color-coded card . This project ass use color-coded method dietary sodium labeling help patient stay within sodium restrict dietary range . A checklist grocery item store use identify tally product patient chooses shop trip . Each checklist also identify assign patient number . Staff instruct provide dietary sodium instruction patient . Staff assist patient choose grocery store item either shopping trip , comment reinforce discourage patient food choice shopping .</detailed_description>
