	<brief_summary>This multicentre randomise double-blind phase II trial , sponsor Gustave Roussy involve one French center well Spanish Lung Cancer Group ( ≈20 center SLCG ) . Five hundred patient diagnosis stage IIIB/IV NSCLC initially register prior receive first line platinum-based chemotherapy provide consent retrieve archival tissue collection provide translational blood sample tumor biopsy . 1 . - Induction chemotherapy phase All patient initially treat 6 cycle platinum-based induction chemotherapy . Cycle duration 21 day . Doublets either consist pemetrexed-platinum ( cisplatin carboplatin ) doublet ( preferentially non-squamous NSCLC ) gemcitabine - vinorelbine - platinum doublet squamous NSCLC . Taxanes-platinum doublet accept . Translational blood sample take begin induction chemotherapy patient . Patients display progressive disease stable disease induction chemotherapy withdrawn optimally manage accord local practice . For , optional tumour biopsy perform end induction treatment . 2 . - Randomisation maintenance phase Only patient respond platinum-based induction chemotherapy randomise olaparib placebo . These patient must treat 6 cycle chemotherapy . However , patient n't receive 6 cycle induction chemotherapy due severe toxicity ( grade 3 4 , NCI CTCAE v4.0 ) could randomize receive 4 chemotherapy cycle least treatment related toxicity resolve grade ≤ 1 ( NCI CTCAE v4.0 ) . Treatment administer dose 600 mg daily ( 2 dose 300 mg [ 2 tablet 150 mg ] take approximately 12 hour apart ) cycle duration 28 day . Disease assess every 2 cycle CTscan ( MRI PET-scan scan contributive ) treatment administer disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients optimally manage accord local practice . Follow-up minimum 15 month time randomization , last venue . All randomise patient ask provide translational blood sample randomization , treatment end treatment . Optional tumour biopsy perform randomization , end treatment ( disease progression available ) .</brief_summary>
