	<brief_summary>The current proposal pilot study . The Investigators plan use next generation genome sequencing ( NGGS ) define molecular genetic profile 3 case germ cell tumor ( GCT ) ( component yolk sac tumor ) time initial diagnosis 3 case late relapse GCT 's , characterize yolk sac tumor ( AFP secrete ) predominant disease . Investigators seek demonstrate feasibility obtain tissue biopsy ( either archive new biopsy ) utilization NGGS study molecular genetic relationship GCT 's ( component yolk sac tumor ) time diagnosis GCT 's time late relapse . This study also provide preliminary information genetic alteration , may hypothesis generate another study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examine two cohort : 1 . The initial diagnosis cohort include 3 patient GCT meet inclusion criterion adequate tissue sample available storage Pathology Department . One prospective blood one tissue sample collect patient cohort . Tissue sample come orchiectomy virgin retro-peritoneal lymph node dissection ( RPLND ) do initial diagnosis . 2 . The late relapse cohort include 3 patient late relapse GCT meet inclusion criterion adequate tissue sample available storage Pathology Department . One prospective blood two tissue sample collect patient cohort . Tissue sample come orchiectomy virgin RPLND do initial diagnosis come site late relapse . Patients cohort biopsy site late relapse part routine cancer treatment . No biopsy perform specifically purpose study . Tissue site late relapse also request Pathology Department . One tube blood collect subject routine clinical visit baseline blood draw already do . In summary , total 15 sample evaluate study . Consent use tissue blood collect purpose study obtain prior study procedure . Subjects adequate tissue sample available replace .</detailed_description>
