	<brief_summary>Title : PROGnostication need REhabilitation Special Support Intensive Care Unit Stay - multinational , observational study Objectives : 1 . To investigate association potential risk factor ( premorbid factor , in-ICU treatments/diagnoses patient status ICU discharge ) three-month physical psychological outcome ICU survivor . 2 . Based association identify risk factor adverse outcome , create validate instrument , use ICU discharge , predict new-onset physical psychological problem three month ICU discharge . Study design : Prospective , observational multi centre ( 10 centre ) cohort study Outcomes : Adverse psychological outcome three month ICU discharge ( Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome-14 ( PTSS-14 ) part B score &gt; 45 Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) subscale score &gt; 10 ) . New-onset physical disability , define reduction Barthel Index ≥10 point compare 2 week prior hospital admission . Study duration : Recruitment patient 2-4 month ten study site . Follow-up primary endpoint 3 month ICU discharge . Number subject : The aim screen eligible patient include 600-1000 ICU survivor recruitment period . The final number include patient depend case-mix unit potential exclusion . Population : Adult patient ( 18 year old ) discharge ICU .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Every year , estimate 5 million patient treated European Intensive Care Units ( ICUs ) yearly , 40 000 Swedish ICUs alone ( 1,2 ) . As many 50 % ICU survivor suffer new-onset physical , psychological cognitive problem month even year ICU discharge , irrespective reason ICU admission ( 3-5 ) . These problem major hurdle patient discharge ICU return life prior hospitalisation , often remain unrecognised healthcare provider ( 3-5 ) . Follow-up lead ICU clinician increasingly recognise addendum critical care ( 5,6 ) . Yet , intervention large unselected group ICU survivor fail demonstrate meaningful improvement ( 7,8 ) except vulnerable subgroup ( 9,10 ) . Dilution treatment effect recognise problem interventional study ( 11 ) . Thus , identify patient risk adverse outcome important enrichment step prior evaluation new intervention . The importance recently highlight stakeholder meet regard post-ICU syndrome ( 12 ) . Pilot study research group indicate risk prediction instrument ICU survivor fairly good accuracy develop used clinical practice ( 13,14 ) predictor need assess validated large sample . Data collection All data enter coded form web-based , electronic Case Report Form ( Pheedit eCRF ) supply Central Steering Committee . The eCRF accessible username password computer internet access . All data enter eCRF . Each centre keep safely place lock patient ID study code list , separate study data . Potential risk factor : Patient characteristic Age Sex Educational level** Working/school/parental leave/retired/unemployed/sick-leave** Physical comorbidities ( Charlson Comorbidity Index &amp; SAPS III box 1 ) ( supplement ) History psychological problem ICU stay , include substance abuse ) Caretaker child &lt; 18 year old** Barthel Index-100 prior fall ill , report patient , and/or proxy together medical chart review In-ICU diagnoses/treatments/status Admission diagnosis ( medical/surgical/trauma ) Acute/elective hospital admission Admission severity illness ( APACHE II ) Pelvic fracture Fractures ( pelvic ) ICU length stay ( hour ) Severe sepsis/septic chock* Days coma ( reason ) Days invasive ventilator treatment Agitation/agitated delirium ICU stay** Patient status ICU discharge Depressive symptom PHQ2 question ( two question , supplement ) ** Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool ( CPAx ) Questions 1-5 ( supplement ) within 24 hour prior discharge* PTSS-14 Part A ( four question , supplement ) ** Social support ( one question , supplement ) Three month post-ICU discharge Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) ( supplement ) Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms 14 ( PTSS-14 ) ( supplement ) Barthel Index ( supplement ) Short Form 36 Health Survey ( supplement ) Health utilization questionnaire Questionnaires sent postal mail patient , together information letter participation study consent form sign unable give consent inclusion . A phone number supply , patient question wish know regard ICU stay . Ten-fourteen day questionnaires sent , reminder telephone call make patient returned questionnaire . Consent Patients ask consent study inclusion . If unable consent , patient ask consent three month post ICU , questionnaires send . Inter-rater reliability Risk factor assess observation , validate instrument available , undergo interrater reliability test within study . Ten patient per centre assess parallel two independent observer , blind other´s assessment . Specifically , factor subject test PHQ2 , PTSS-14 part A , question regard social support CPAx . Outcome measure : Two primary outcome measure : 1 . Adverse psychological outcome three month post-ICU discharge define subscale score &gt; 10 Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) , indicative clinically significant depressive anxiety symptom , AND/OR Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms -14 ( PTSS-14 ) part B score &gt; 45 indicative clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptom . 2 . Adverse physical outcome ( new-onset physical disability ) three month post-ICU discharge define worsen Barthel Index-100 10 point , compare report Barthel Index-100 two week prior hospitalisation .</detailed_description>
