	<brief_title>B-type Natriuretic Peptide Guided Therapy Improve Clinical Outcomes Patients Undergoing Non-cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study hypothesis aim . The primary hypothesis BETTER Surgery Pilot Trial BNP direct medical therapy prior noncardiac surgery associate improve cardiovascular outcome , compare standard care . The aim pilot trial test feasibility preoperative BNP direct medical therapy trial , intention go onto large international multicentred RCT . Primary outcome measure . A composite 30 day mortality , nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal cardiac arrest , congestive cardiac failure re-operation . Secondary outcome measure . Difference BNP level time surgery An analysis outcomes measure achieve value i.e . value measure immediately prior surgery . Duration hospital stay Admission critical care Time surgery Reoperation Trial design . A prospective , multi-centre , randomised trial BNP guide therapy improve clinical outcome patient undergo non-cardiac surgery . Inclusion criterion . High risk elective preoperative noncardiac surgical patient refer preanaesthetic clinic preoperative risk stratification . Exclusion criterion . Patient refusal participate Where clinical opinion suggest surgery postpone least 3 4 week allow clinical response change medical therapy Randomisation . Patients randomized outpatient clinic visit decision take surgery necessary . This follow inform consent . Patients would randomize standard care BNP direct care . Following randomization , BNP measure patient . 1 . Standard-of-care arm . These patient manage per standard preoperative stratification strategy participate unit . All personnel blind BNP result . Optimisation medical therapy encourage . 2 . BNP guide therapy patient . Based individual patient data meta-analysis noncardiac surgical patient , threshold associate BNP MACE know . Based BNP threshold , follow recommendation make ; High risk : Additional medical therapy and/or uptitration current therapy strongly recommend . It strongly recommend surgery defer BNP fall high risk threshold possible allow therapy response . Intemediate risk : Additional therapy and/or uptitration current therapy recommend . It recommend surgery defer possible allow therapy response . Low risk : Surgery recommend soon perioperative consideration address . Ideally , surgery recommend early convenience . Additional visit may also schedule discretion investigator BNP risk stratification prior surgery discretion treat physician . Neither attend physician , patient blind BNP result BNP guide therapy arm . BNP level repeat patient schedule surgery . These preoperative BNP result blind . Irrespective treatment group noncardiac patient randomize , recommend surgical patient receive statin therapy perioperative period aspirin , stop 72 hour surgery , re-instituted 7 day postoperatively . Intraoperative postoperative management discretion local physician . Drug therapy . Drug therapy use BETTER trial compliant practice guideline heart failure therapy , point ensure ACE-inhibition , beta-blockade mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism . Uptitration drug know decrease mortality associate cardiac failure secondary prevention myocardial infarction consider . The minimum maximum dos advocate PROTECT study adopt BETTER Surgery Pilot Trial . Uptitration consider uptitration therapy associate improved survival heart failure study . End point adjudication . All end point adjudicate physician blind treatment allocation . Withdrawal rule . Subjects free voluntarily withdraw BETTER Surgery Trial time . However , event experience withdrawn patient analyze end trial function treatment allocation intent-to-treat consideration . Ethics approval . Ethics approval obtain university centre . Steering committee member ensure ethic approval obtain respective centre prior trial participation . Data collection collation . Access electronic data entry system protect username password . Username password deliver registration process individual local investigator . All electronic data transfer participate centre co-ordinating centre username password protect . Each centre maintain trial file include protocol , local investigator delegation log , ethic approval documentation etc . Pseudo-anonymised ( cod ) data may also send mail coordinate centre necessary event adjudication . Statistical analysis . Categorical variable describe proportion compare use chi-square Fisher 's exact test . Continuous variable describe mean standard deviation normally distributed median inter-quartile range normally distribute . Comparisons continuous variable perform use one-way ANOVA Mann-Whitney test appropriate . Primary clinical end point . Kaplan-Meier curve construct evaluate time first event compare use log-rank test . Lastly , univariable follow multivariable analysis identify independent predictor outcomes , subsequent regression analysis perform compare event rate , adjust difference baseline variable . It expect patient BNP guide therapy arm may end repeat visit compare standard care arm trial . To understand whether increase contact associate well outcomes rather lower BNP , covariate analysis control total visit versus visit trigger BNP evaluation therapeutic intervention , perform determine potential effect increase visit patient outcomes . Trial management . Participating centre need routinely provide preoperative risk stratification service high risk noncardiac surgical patient . The pilot trial lead Bruce Biccard . Site leader , identify co-participants application . Sample size calculation . For propose composite outcome expect least 10 % event rate . In large international multicentre trial , assume 25 % relative risk reduction primary outcome BNP direct therapy group event rate 10 % , estimate sample size 2075 patient per group would provide 80 % power ( Î± =0.05 ) . For pilot trial recruit 100 patient . How trial lead large study . A review literature preoperative BNP risk stratification suggest integrate preoperative BNP risk stratification model reach 4th stage integrate biomarker clinical practice ( clinical utility ) . This surpass current Revised Cardiac Risk Index ( RCRI ) clinical standard preoperative risk stratification process . There good individual patient data meta-analyses use establish BNP threshold associate adverse outcomes . This stress importance ( yet lack ) randomise control trial address utility biomarker risk stratification improve patient outcomes biomarker direct therapy , management monitoring noncardiac surgical patient . The fifth stage integration biomarker clinical practice demand demonstration biomarker direct therapy improve clinical outcome . A single study conduct non-surgical population , show aggressive heart failure therapy regimen driven targetting BNP generally well tolerate elderly associate significantly few cardiovascular event . This pilot trial ass feasibility important preoperative surgical clinical RCT . These data use plan conduct large , multicentre RCT address question . References . 1 . Hlatky MA , et al .
