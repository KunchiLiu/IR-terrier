	<brief_summary>Cardiac rehabilitation patient often fail exercise prescribe day attend rehabilitation steep drop exercise follow rehabilitation completion . Moreover , little known amount time cardiac rehabilitation patient spend sedentary behavior , associate increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality , independent time spend exercise . This pilot study aim test acceptability , feasibility , preliminary efficacy smartphone application ( B-MOBILE-CARDIAC ) increase time spend moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity accumulate bout least 10 minute duration ( i.e . bout-related MVPA ) decrease time spend sedentary behavior . Up 32 patient recruit , enrol , randomize first 2 week cardiac rehabilitation either : 1 ) B-MOBILE-CARDIAC plus cardiac rehabilitation 2 ) cardiac rehabilitation alone . Participants complete 7 day objective activity monitoring measure daily minute spend bout-related MVPA sedentary behavior ( primary outcome ) baseline , mid-rehabilitation ( 6 week ) , end cardiac rehabilitation ( 12 week ) , 4-week follow-up ( 16 week ) . At time point , participant complete questionnaire assess sedentary behavior , MVPA , exercise tolerance , health-related quality life , mood , affect . At baseline end cardiac rehabilitation participant undergo blood draw measure cardiometabolic inflammatory risk factor complete test cognitive functioning . Feasibility acceptability B-MOBILE-CARDIAC application assess 4-week follow-up .</brief_summary>
