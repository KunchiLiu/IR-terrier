	<brief_summary>This study compare near clinical oculomotor parameter ( heterophoria , vergence range , AC/A accommodative finding ) measure lens and/or prism introduce use three different instrument namely : ( ) standard manual phoropter , ( ii ) electronic phoropter ( iii ) wearable adaptive refractor ( VisionFit ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study demonstrate difference number near oculomotor parameter [ e.g. , heterophoria , accommodative convergence accommodation ( AC/A ) ratio ] measure manual phoropter versus trial frame . These difference may due variation proximal vergence , difference head eye position restriction peripheral visual field . Further , number standard clinical oculomotor procedure require use Risley rotary prism . While prism typically introduce smooth , ramp-like fashion manual phoropters , step change prism create electronic phoropters . The precise effect variation clinical measurement unclear . Accordingly , routine refractive examination , standard clinical near assessment ( comprise near heterophoria , AC/A ratio , horizontal vergence range , amplitude accommodation negative positive relative accommodation ) carry individual : ( ) standard manual phoropter ( American Optical model 11625 ) , ( ii ) electronic phoropter ( Topcon CV-5000 ) ( iii ) wearable adaptive refractor ( VisionFit ) . The latter resembles trial frame mount helmet carrier ( similar binocular indirect ophthalmoscope headset ) include adaptive lens change electronically .</detailed_description>
