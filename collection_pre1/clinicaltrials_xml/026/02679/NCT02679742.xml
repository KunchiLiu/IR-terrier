	<brief_title>Postacute Sarcopenia : Supplementation With β-hydroxyMethylbutyrate After Resistance Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcopenia geriatric syndrome characterize loss skeletal muscle mass strength occur advance age ; relate frailty , fall , worsen quality life , death chronic elderly patient . Diagnosis sarcopenia base clinical criterion : presence low muscle mass presence low muscle function and/or low physical performance . The late development indicate dietary supplementation combine resistance exercise could option improve muscle mass function . The objective study assess effect β-hydroxymethylbutyrate ( β-HMB ) combine resistance training program , acute process old patient sarcopenia term muscle mass , muscle strength physical performance . Design : A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel study two intervention group . The investigator shall compare placebo intervention β-HMB patient perform resistance training program acute process ( post-acute period ) 12 week . There 20 patient arm study . Additionally one year follow visit perform .</detailed_description>
