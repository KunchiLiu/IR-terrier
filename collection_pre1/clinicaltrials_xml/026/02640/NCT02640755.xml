	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open label , single centre , non-randomised study patient advance solid malignancy refractory resistant standard treatment suitable effective standard treatment exist paclitaxel fulvestrant appropriate treatment choice . The study divide two part : 1 . Single Dose Period - enrol 6 evaluable patient characterise absorption , metabolism , excretion pharmacokinetics single radiolabelled [ 14C ] oral dose 125mg AZD2014 via residential intensive PK sample 8 day . An evaluable patient define patient vomit within 2 hour post dose complete scheduled PK sampling . 2 . Multiple Dose Period - patient complete Single Dose Period may continue receive treatment outpatient . Patients allocate different treatment regime decide Investigator patient risk / benefit basis . From Day 1 , Cycle 1 , non-radiolabelled AZD2014 treatment administer oral tablet patient , either : . 50mg BD monotherapy ii . 125mg BD take first 2 day treatment week combination 500mg intramuscular fulvestrant Day 1 , Cycle 1 , Day 15 , Cycle 1 ; Day 1 , Cycle 2 , Day 1 monthly cycle thereafter iii . 50mg BD take first 3 day treatment week 6 week combination single weekly paclitaxel infusion ( 80mg/m2 ) follow one week break treatment AZD2014 paclitaxel give . This 7 week schedule compose one cycle treatment . Patients give 6 cycle paclitaxel , although additional cycle paclitaxel may give deem appropriate Investigator . Radiolabelled AZD2014 administer fasted patient ( i.e . food 2 hour 1 hour dose ) . Non-radiolabelled AZD2014 administer either fast non-fasted condition . The safety tolerability anti-tumour activity AZD2014 combination paclitaxel fulvestrant evaluate enrolled patient respectively use conventional safety parameter , AEs/SAEs RECIST 1.1 .</detailed_description>
