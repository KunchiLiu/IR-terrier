	<brief_summary>It common practice insert Foley catheter bladder drain urine lung resection . Recently , increase interest potential risk associate catheterization , particularly regard infection . As thoracic surgery adopt minimally invasive surgical technique , need urinary catheterization surgery question since less invasive surgery know result less post-operative acute pain , short length stay , outcome tend decrease overall anesthetic need patient population . Thus , need investigate whether patient minimally invasive lung resection truly need Foley catheter . This achieve assign patient either experimental no-catheter group standard care routine urinary catheter group determine patient catheter experience different rate complication . This pilot study primarily determine study feasible test suitability new patient quality life tool . Secondarily , study look see difference post operative urinary complication group . Should study prove feasible , information learn use determine sample size requirement fully power trial , order definitively determine whether Foley urine catheter necessary procedure course minimally invasive lung resection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Urinary catheterization standard practice shortly lung resection . The standard practice question era unnecessary intervention re-considered , particularly since urinary catheterization without risk adverse event . The study do establish evidence base support widespread discontinuation continuation standard practice . Consenting patient randomize either catheterized non-catheterized arm . Patient urinary management manage per priori-defined protocol follow St. Joseph 's Healthcare Hamilton ( SJHH ) institutional standard . Patients complete pre/post-op questionnaire baseline first followup visit , feasibility outcomes collect . The primary objective ass feasibility full scale trial .</detailed_description>
