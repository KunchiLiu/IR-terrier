	<brief_summary>Fractures supracondylar region humerus among common pediatric injury require attention orthopaedic surgeon . Children non-displaced fracture ( Type I ) , well history elbow trauma , traditionally manage non-surgical immobilization . Recently publish clinical guideline support practice , base result two prospective study either collar cuff posterior splint immobilization use . When compare collar cuff immobilization , posterior splint result well pain relief within first two week injury ; however , critical outcome , include incidence cubitus varus , hyperextension , loss reduction , report . While posterior splint appear attractive option treatment non-displaced pediatric elbow fracture , recent retrospective analysis use posterior splint treatment injury report small proportion fracture demonstrate displacement . The potential non-compliance use removable device , especially old pediatric population , also concern . The use removable immobilization reliably maintain fracture alignment , minimize risk non-compliance , result similar outcome obtain regular casting could advantageous : It appear immobilization could remove easily safely home , potentially result low number patient visit , decrease health-care cost , high patient/parent satisfaction . Telemedicine , define use telecommunication information technology order provide clinical health care distance , seldom used field pediatric orthopaedics . Commonly mention attribute telemedicine include improved access healthcare provider , cost containment increase healthcare efficiency , quality care improvement related patient satisfaction , potential reduction travel time patient family . The purpose randomized , control , prospective study assess telemedicine tool treatment follow-up non-displaced SCHF fracture child . Investigators hypothesize use telemedicine result comparable clinical outcome obtain patient treated clinical facility , increase patient satisfaction decrease healthcare cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct IRB approve , single-center , randomize , open label trial , child present investigator institution non-displaced ( Type 1 ) SCHF occult elbow injury ( determine presence posterior fat pad sign ) receive long-arm soft , fiberglass cast ( reinforce posterior slab ) ( 3MTD `` ScotchcastTM '' Soft Cast Casting Tape ) elbow flexed 90-100 degree forearm neutral rotation randomize one two group : Patients Group A receive follow-up care entirely investigator institution , patient Group B receive follow-up care use telemedicine tool . Written inform consent obtain parent patient . For patient age seven ten year , child assent also obtain . Randomization accomplish use sealed envelope , sequentially numbered outside , random sequence A B conceal . Sample size estimation base outcome variable percent average total satisfaction score . The investigator previous study OIC present standard deviation satisfaction score 15 % . Clinically significant difference satisfaction score order 10 15 % . In present study , 25 patient group include , total 50 patient . With sample size , investigator able detect difference 12 % satisfaction score alpha 0.05 80 % power .</detailed_description>
