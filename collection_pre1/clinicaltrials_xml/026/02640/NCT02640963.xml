	<detailed_description>Study Design Recruitment This study compare delivery feasibility outcomes 12-week combined resistance weight bear exercise programme investigator name GrACE programme . Participant recruitment assessment occur five-month period . The RAC approach participation via email telephone follow-up . Potential participant identify meet facility Service Manager . Participants screen via inclusion criterion meet Service Manager Registered Nurse , write consent attain prior participation . Following explanation procedure , purpose , benefit associate risk study , participant opportunity ask question . A total 37 old RAC adult provide write informed consent study . The exercise group contain 20 participant control group 17 participant . Ethical approval conduct study attain Bond University 's Human Ethics Research Committee ( RO 1823 ) . Intervention : GrACE programme Previous work group trialled successful exercise programme respite day care could promise benefit RAC ( HenwoodWooding &amp; de Souza 2013 ) . In brief , GrACE programme include number target weight-bearing exercise ( use body weight dumbbell ) range seat , non-resisted upper- lower-body dynamic reaching movement . While develop respite care older adult , programme slightly modify RAC set ; initially use reduce range motion resistance , extend conditioning/familiarisation phase . The conditioning phase last three week technique emphasise without use weight additional resistance . The focus technique condition phase develop correct technique minimise potential delay onset muscle soreness adverse effect . After conclude condition phase , participant able use light dumbbell ( often start 0.5kg ) increase heavy dumbbell ( 4kg ) increase capacity course programme . Participants perform exercise twice per week 12 week . Training session last approximately 45 minute , separate least 48 hour deliver allied health professional experience work RAC adult . Control Group All subject assign control group give option engage activity offer facility 12-week intervention period . Activities facility specific , include Zumba Gold aerobic exercise walking , however specific resistance exercise offer . Data Collection Reasons refusal ( non-consent ) participate record ( Henwood 2014 ) . All muscle function outcome measure study previously validate use older adult , protocol report elsewhere ( Henwood , Wooding &amp; de Souza 2013 ; Sterke et al . 2012 ) . Assessments complete one-on-one participant . During muscle function measure assessment , participant encourage rest need give verbal support encouragement reduce potential burden participant .</detailed_description>
