	<brief_summary>Postprandial glucose ( PPG ) excursion determine insulin-mediated glucose disposal endogenous glucose production ( regulate insulin glucagon ) ; also rate gastric empty constitutes important determinant PPG level 1 . The short-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) receptor agonist lixisenatide use treatment type 2 diabetes . It increase glucose-dependent insulin secretion , suppress glucagon secretion reduces gastric empty meal 2 . These three mechanism likely constitute weighty mechanism behind potent impact lixisenatide exaggerate PPG excursion patient type 2 diabetes - often normalised lixisenatide treatment 3 . However , separate impact lixisenatide-induced reduction gastric emptying ( independently pancreatic effect ) difficult determine . Importantly , treatment lixisenatide also decrease appetite food intake may , like native GLP-1 , increase energy expenditure 4 . So far exact demarcation pancreatic extrapancreatic effect lixisenatide human remain establish . The present project serve determine whether effect lixisenatide gastric emptying , appetite , food intake rest energy expenditure dependent endocrine pancreas . The study randomise , placebo-controlled , double-blinded , cross-over study . 12 healthy person 12 pancreatectomized patient ( i.e . patient pancreata remove due pancreatic cancer severe chronic pancreatitis ) subject two experimental day undergo liquid meal test follow fasting period finish ad libitum meal lixisenatide placebo , respectively .</brief_summary>
