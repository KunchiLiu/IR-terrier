	<brief_summary>Acute colorectal obstruction report occur 7 - 29 % colorectal malignancy , emergent surgical decompression associate high morbidity mortality rate . Recently , self-expandable metal stent ( SEMS ) suggest alternative surgery effectively decompress colonic obstruction allow bowel preparation elective surgery . Theoretically , SEMSs classify uncovered stent cover stent . Covered stent advantage le frequent stent occlusion tumor in-growth disadvantage high risk stent migration , whereas uncovered stent associate less stent migration , although appear prone tumor ingrowth . To overcome drawback conventional stent , double-layered combination cover stent developed . In present study , investigator evaluate efficacy safety newly design covered stent compare uncovered stent patient malignant colorectal obstruction .</brief_summary>
