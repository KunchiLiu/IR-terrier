	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Study MM-398 Plus Irinotecan Patients With Unresectable Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This dose-finding therapeutic exploratory phase Ib multi-center , open label study MM-398 plus irinotecan two different setting : - Group A : patient unresectable advanced non-colorectal cancer receive MM-398 irinotecan - Group B : patient unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer receive MM-398 irinotecan combine leucovorin , 5-fluorouracil bevacizumab . These group enrol parallel . Pharmacokinetic biomarker sample also perform . There three period study : Screening period ( -28d ) : patient undergo screen assessment determine eligibility study MM-398 treatment period ( C1D1 safety evaluation/progression ) : patient receive treatment every 2 week undergo biopsy require assessment . The treatment period divide maximum 3 dose level Follow period : patient followed-up 30 day last dose MM-398 final safety assessment , every 2 month thereafter overall survival follow-up</detailed_description>
