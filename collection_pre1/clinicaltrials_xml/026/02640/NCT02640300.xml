	<detailed_description>Clozapine demonstrate clinically superior antipsychotic treatment-resistant schizophrenia ( TRS ) , position treatment guideline . Because relegate use TRS , guideline require used antipsychotic fail ; accordingly , clinician routinely contend stop previous antipsychotic make switch clozapine . Perhaps numerous potentially severe side effect , issue clozapine titration frequently address , although knowledge study , yet , assessed comparability gradual vs. immediate antipsychotic discontinuation switch clozapine . While question ask vis-à-vis clozapine , several study examine gradual vs. immediate antipsychotic discontinuation switch antipsychotic . Immediate antipsychotic discontinuation associate follow risk : ( 1 ) withdrawal/discontinuation symptom rebound syndromes related cholinergic , histaminergic , serotonergic activity ; ( 2 ) supersensitivity syndrome ( e.g. , withdrawal dyskinesia , supersensitivity psychosis ) ; ( 3 ) exacerbation/re-emergence symptom secondary diminish response newly introduce antipsychotic . On hand , gradual antipsychotic discontinuation associate risk worsening/emergent side effect . This say , study , include one meta-analysis , report difference efficacy safety immediate gradual discontinuation strategy antipsychotic switching . However , also note study conduct open-label design single-blind design . To address gap knowledge specific clozapine , investigator conduct pilot , 8-week , double-blind , randomize control trial examine immediate vs. gradual antipsychotic discontinuation patient schizophrenia undergoing switch clozapine .</detailed_description>
