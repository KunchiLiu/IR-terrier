	<detailed_description>The retina actually brain tissue consider part central nervous system ( CNS ) . It part CNS visualize directly non-invasively . There already body evidence retinal neuron accumulate alpha-synuclein degenerate Parkinson disease ( PD ) . Whether retinal imaging could useful objective biomarker track disease progression response disease-modifying treatment patient PD know . While variety image technique available ( e.g. , PET , SPECT , MRI ) , none emerge fully reliable method accurately measure clinical progression PD . The structure retina study easily vivo use spectral domain high definition optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , non-invasive imaging technique resolution ~1 micron ( 0.001 mm ) . OCT quantify thickness different retinal layer . The primary aim proposal determine whether OCT reliable clinical measure objectively measure clinical progression PD . Our group show recently OCT use mean measure progressive neuronal loss retina patient synucleinopathy closely relate PD ( multiple system atrophy , MSA ) . In MSA , retinal degeneration closely associated disease severity progressively worsen overtime predictable fashion , sufficient biostatistical modeling . We want find also true PD . There panel non-motor clinical feature increase risk develop PD . We propose measure retinal nerve fiber density patient consider `` pre-motor '' PD follow clinical evolution overtime . If OCT prove useful mean identify pre-motor PD , result would present important therapeutic window intervene disease modify drug prevent development CNS deficit . We plan determine whether retinal morphology correlate visual function use complementary measure visual electrophysiology technique , include pattern electroretinogram ( PERG ) photopic negative response ( PhNR ) . These technique use patient PD synucleinopathies , map closely retinal function abnormality . But , little data describe functional measure retina progression time PD . We hypothesize patient PD specific pattern damage retinal structure function , pattern identify premotor phase , We believe OCT use objective biomarker premotor diagnosis disease progression . INNOVATION : The structure retina present ideal opportunity image CNS overtime OCT. As widely available clinical technique correlate closely functional measure visual electrophysiology , OCT increasingly use multiple sclerosis neurodegenerative disorder . If successful , work may provide significant tool diagnosis PD pre-motor phase could use clinical outcome measure disease-modifying trial . To achieve objective , take advantage infrastructure use ongoing NIH-funded Natural History Autonomic Disorders study ( ClnicalTrials.gov : NCT01799915 ) , prospectively follow patient synucleinopathies standardize neurological measure overtime . The proposal provide measure retinal structure conjunction measure disease severity group patient well-defined PD . By measure retinal structure group patient consider high risk develop PD ( namely REM sleep behavior disorder -RBD , isolate autonomic failure ) determine usefulness OCT mean identify PD premotor phase .</detailed_description>
