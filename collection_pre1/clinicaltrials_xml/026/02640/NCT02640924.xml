	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one common cancer Taiwan , chronic viral hepatitis common . Patients HCC typically impair liver function virus- alcohol- induced cirrhosis viral hepatitis , approximately 20 % appropriate candidate surgery . The 5-year overall survival patient treat surgery approximately 30 % -70 % . For treated surgery , liver function affect underlying liver disease strong influence clinical outcome , complicate treatment strategy tumor . Maximal preservation normal liver volume function important consideration choice treatment . Proton beam apply HCC treatment Japan long decade , several retrospective result show excellent 3-5 year local control rate range 85-95 % nearly major complication . The investigator also retrospectively review 75 index tumor size 3.1-7.0cm 70 patient receive multiple-electrode radiofrequency ablation switch controller ( ME-SWC RFA ) treatments period 1 January 2009 31 December 2011 ( Oral report Taiwan Digestive Disease Week , October , 2012 ) . Estimated 1- , 2- , 3-year cumulative overall survival rate local control rate 94 % , 85 % , 81 % 89 % , 83 % , 67 % , respectively . Since ME-SWC RFA present one standard modalities non-surgery , moderate large ( 3-7 cm ) HCC , base retrospective study local control rate proton therapy well radiofrequency ablation , prospective trial aim compare effect two modality 3-7 cm HCC patient candidate surgery refuse surgery . This prospective study high possibility confirm role proton beam HCC . Along clinical trial , investigator also use next generation sequencing ( NGS ) exam gene expression profile tumor sample find candidate gene relate local control , intrahepatic control ( treatment out-field control liver ) , regional lymph node relapse , distant metastasis , treatment response HCC .</brief_summary>
