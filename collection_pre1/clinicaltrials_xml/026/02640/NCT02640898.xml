	<brief_title>Docetaxel-based Chemoradiotherapy Plus Periradiation Chemotherapy Compared With INT 0116 Adjuvant Arm Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intergroup 0116 trial first demonstrate adjuvant chemoradiotherapy offer significant survival benefit . In study , 556 patient R0 resect gastric cancer randomly assign surgery plus postoperative chemoradiotherapy surgery alone . The adjuvant treatment consist 425 mg per square meter bolus fluorouracil per day , 20 mg per square meter leucovorin , per day , 5 day , follow 45 Gy radiation current fluorouracil ( 400mg per square meter ) leucovorin ( 20mg per square meter ) intravenous bolus first four day last three day irradiation . One month completion radiotherapy , two 5-day cycle fluorouracil leucovorin chemotherapy give one month apart . Patients adjuvant arm achieve significant 3-year overall relapse-free survival benefit 9 % 17 % , respectively . Despite improvement outcome , 120 281 patient chemoradiotherapy arm relapse local regional or/and distant site within 3 year potentially curative resection . Notably , patient receive chemoradiotherapy high rate distant metastasis compare control arm ( 40/281 vs 32/275 ) , indicate bolus 5-FU/LV suboptimal control development distant metastasis . Furthermore , toxicity INT 0116 trial substantial , grade 3 high overall toxicity observe 73 % case . As result , 64 % patient able complete protocol therapy . Obviously , reasonable optimize Intergroup 0116 chemoradiotherapy regimen . Docetaxel , monotherapy , active first- second-line treatment advance stage gastric cancer . In addition , vitro vivo study demonstrate docetaxel potent radiosensitizer human cancer cell line , make attractive agent combine radiation . A phase I study identified phase II recommend dose docetaxel 20mg/m2 weekly six week administer concurrent chest radiation 60 Gy . Furthermore , docetaxel add standard cisplatin infuse fluorouracil ( DCF regimen ) demonstrate advantage survival , time progression , response rate ( RR ) cisplatin fluorouracil ( CF ) randomize phase Ⅲ trial , toxicity profile associate DCF regimen significant . In addition , favorable RR median overall survival DCF epirubicin , cisplatin , protract venous infusion fluorouracil ( ECF ) see randomize phase Ⅱ trial . Two large phase III trial demonstrate addition perioperative chemotherapy ( ECF ) adjuvant chemotherapy ( S1 ) radical surgery could significantly improve surgical outcome localize gastric cancer compare surgery alone term progression-free overall survival . These result suggest adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy may excellent effect primary tumor micrometasatsis . Based important finding , design phase 3 trial compare novel docetaxel-based chemoradiotherapy regimen Intergroup 0116 adjuvant arm patient curatively resect gastric cancer</detailed_description>
