	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , specifically hemoglobin SC disease ( HbSC ) , subtype sickle cell disease typically high hemoglobin milder later disease complication . Sickle cell disease disorder red blood cell ( RBCs ) abnormally shape . This result painful episode , serious infection , damage body organ . One medication use treat sickle cell disease hydroxyurea . Hydroxyurea therapy offer significant benefit infant , child , adolescent sickle cell anemia . These include reduction frequency pain crisis acute chest syndrome ( inflammation lung ) . Hydroxyurea give many HbSC patient HbSC patient include large clinical trial use test hydroxyurea SCD , less known HbSC patient respond hydroxyurea . The purpose research study see hydroxyurea , medication give many patient common type sickle cell , homozygous sickle mutation ( HbSS ) , help individual HbSC . The investigator see help give questionaire medication start , every two month clinic visit . The questionaire , call AdultsQLTM 3.0 Sickle Cell Disease Module , measure quality life . The investigator also see hydroxyurea change laboratory test number , blood thickness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients recruit patient population follow Texas Children 's Cancer Hematology Centers ( TCC/HC ) /Baylor College Medicine ( BCM ) University Texas Houston Hematology Center . To eligible participate study , patient must HbSC disease , experience sickle cell disease related complication , score 80 low AdultQLTM Sickle Cell Disease Module 3.0 . This questionnaire offer patient HbSC see clinic consent study . Patients must also agree clinic visit every two month , phlebotomy , blood removal 6 month study meet criterion phlebotomy . If patient sexually active female , offer birth control . If patient chooses initiate effective birth control , test schedule visit urine pregnancy test . If patient becomes pregnant remove study . Patients assess clinic every two month start treatment . Hydroxyurea start 10 mg/kg/day , increase 5 mg/kg/day need maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 35/mg/day . The common side effect drug drop infection fight cell , white blood cell , medication start low dose dose increase safe . After 6 month MTD study , patient evaluate response hydroxyurea . If reach MTD 6 month time study increase allow 6 month observation MTD . The minimum time patient study 12 month start hydroxyurea therapy option participate 2 year observation study follow end study . If patient minimal benefit medication , monthly phlebotomy add treatment regimen , 7-10 ml/kg . The first phlebotomy volume 7 ml/kg , may increase 10 ml/kg obtain target Hb 9-10 g/dL . Patients remain hydroxyurea phlebotomy six month . If Hb le equal 9.0 g/dL phlebotomy visit , phlebotomy perform phlebotomy visit space every 2 month . Patients time study increase allow 6 month observation ensure late harmful effect . The minimum time patient study 18 month start phlebotomy option participate 2 year observation study follow end study . Patients ask allow investigator review information medical record start study , throughout study . If patient would like participate two year follow-up , record review period well .</detailed_description>
