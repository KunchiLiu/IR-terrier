	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Studies show COPD patient bronchial hypersecretion increase risk acute exacerbation . FREE ASPIRE electro-medical device remove bronchopulmonary secretion noninvasively , without use suction catheter without generate airway pressure . AIM : To compare FREE ASPIRE activity traditional treatment use PEP-bottle clearance bronchial secretion COPD patient METHODS : Forty severe severe COPD patient mucus reduce cough evaluate . Group comparison make Intervention group use VAKÜM system ( Free Aspire® ) , Control group use traditional treatment PEP-bottle 10 daily session ( 20 minute twice day ) . Primary outcome change arterial blood gas exchange , perceive dyspnea symptom bronchial encumbrance . EXPECTED RESULTS : A high significant reduction perceive dyspnea perceive bronchial encumbrance suppose Intervention group . Additional benefit among secondary outcome also hypothesize group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial FreeAspire Versus PEP-bottle After Acute Exacerbation COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) complex heterogeneous disease , whose pathophysiological aspect remain still today unknown . Among various phenotype , chronic bronchitis present mucus hypersecretion clinical distinctive character , also pathogenic role . Studies show COPD patient bronchial hypersecretion increase risk acute exacerbation . This risk negative impact disease progression , quality life patient direct indirect cost . It necessary identify efficient instrument technique allow obtain airway clearance , usable clinical setting , include rehabilitation center , suitable large number patient . FREE ASPIRE electro-medical device remove bronchopulmonary secretion noninvasively , without use suction catheter without generate airway pressure , positive negative . FREE ASPIRE use VAKÜM technology , accelerate expiratory flow airway , also use patient reduced cough efficiency . Aim study . To compare FREE ASPIRE activity traditional treatment use PEP-bottle clearance bronchial secretion COPD patient mucus hypersecretion decrease cough efficiency , test hypothesis newly develop VAKÜM technology may provide additional clinical benefit conventional treatment term clinical functional outcome . Materials method . This single center , randomize preliminary prospective study . The study approve Internal Review Board Malcantonese Hospital , 6980 Castelrotto , Switzerland procedures perform Division Internal Respiratory Medicine . Following preliminary run-in period , group comparison make Intervention group use VAKÜM system ( Free Aspire , MPR , Legnano , Italy ) , Control group use traditional treatment PEP-bottle 10 daily session ( 20 minute twice day ) . All patient receive regular treatment inhale bronchodilator inhale steroid accord current guideline disease stage . Each patient sign inform consent form . Considering probability 15 % drop-out rate randomize patient , consider enroll least 24 patient per group . Spirometric lung volume , respiratory muscle strength ( MIP MEP ) , arterial blood gas , perceive dyspnea ( BDI-TDI scale ) , peak expiratory air flow ( PEF PCEF ) , perceive bronchial encumbrance ( VAS scale ) quality life ( Clinical COPD Questionnaire , CCQ , CAT ) record group pre-to-post PR . Continuous data report mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) , unless otherwise specify . The distribution variable assess mean Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness-of-Fit test . Comparisons quantitative qualitative variable determine paired unpaired test , χ2 test , appropriate . Relationships variable assess Pearson 's correlation coefficient ( r ) Spearman 's correlation coefficient ( r ) , appropriate . Data analyse graphical presentation perform use GraphPad Prism 5 ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , California , USA ) SPSS version 20 ( IBM , Armonk , New York , USA ) . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Study start date : January 2016 Estimated study completion date : June 2017 Expected result . A high significant reduction perceive dyspnea perceive bronchial encumbrance suppose Intervention group . Additional benefit among secondary outcome also hypothesize group .</detailed_description>
