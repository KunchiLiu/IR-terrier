	<brief_title>Cog-VACCINE : Cognitive Training Patients With Vascular Cognitive Impairment , Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Vascular cognitive impairment dementia ( VCIND ) refers cognitive deficit associate underlying vascular cause fall short dementia diagnosis . Because high prevalence high progression dementia , interest VCIND greatly expand recent year . Although widely recognize early intervention VCIND hold potential delay even reverse cognitive impairment , treatment available yet . Executive dysfunction characteristic impairment subcortical VCIND , cognitive training significantly improve executive aspect cognitive function health old adult patient cognitive impairment . Whether cognitive training improves cognitive function patient VCIND remain largely unknown . Objectives : The primary objective double-blinded , randomized RCT ass whether internet-based cognitive training patient subcortical VCIND improve cognitive ability . The second objective evaluate effect cognitive training neural plasticity , include brain activation white matter integrity , assess functional structural MRI . Finally , possible genetic plasma biomarkers related positive effect lack effect training examine . Patients Methods : The propose study three-center , double-blinded , randomize controlled trial include 60 patient diagnose VCIND neurology clinic Beijing Friendship hospital , Xuan Wu hospital , geriatric clinic Fu Xing hospital , Capital Medical University . The patient randomize either train control group . The intervention internet-based cognitive training perform 30 minute 35 session . Neuropsychological assessment functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perform 7 week training . Relevance : Currently know treatment available VCIND . The propose study determine efficacy cognitive training patient VCIND . Secondly , use functional structural MRI , study reveal potential mechanism underlie cognitive training .</detailed_description>
