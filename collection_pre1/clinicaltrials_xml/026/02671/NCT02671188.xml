	<brief_summary>Chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 20 ( CCL20 ) protein involve attract immune cell include subset T cell ( example Th17 cell ) , B cell , natural killer cell dendritic cell inflame tissue condition psoriasis ( Ps ) psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) . CCL20 act bind activate chemokine receptor 6 ( CCR6 ) present surface inflammatory cell . Levels CCL20 increase inflamed tissue psoriasis ( Ps ) inflammatory arthritis . GSK3050002 humanize Immunoglobulin G ( Ig ) G monoclonal antibody , bind neutralizes action human CCL20 . The hypothesis GSK3050002 reduce movement inflammatory cell tissue affect Ps PsA , thereby lead improvement disease activity . The primary objective multi-centre , randomize , double-blind ( sponsor open ) , placebo-controlled trial evaluate safety tolerability repeat dose GSK3050002 , understand mechanism action ( take skin synovial biopsy sample ) potential clinical efficacy GSK3050002 subject PsA . A minimum 18 subject maximum 30 subject randomise study either GSK3050002 placebo 2:1 ratio ensure approximately 18 evaluable subject complete study .
