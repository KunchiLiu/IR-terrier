	<brief_title>Post-discharge Malaria Chemoprevention ( PMC ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children hospitalize severe anemia Africa high risk readmission death within 6 month discharge . No strategy specifically address post-discharge period . In Malawi , 3 month post-discharge malaria chemoprevention monthly 3-day treatment course artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) child severe malarial anemia prevent 31 % deaths readmission . This study confirmatory efficacy trial Kenya Uganda determine efficacy safety malaria chemoprevention post-discharge . We hypothesize additional three month malaria chemoprevention monthly 3-day treatment course DHA-piperaquine ( provide 4 week post-treatment prophylaxis ) provide post-discharge period child recently admit severe anemia superior reduce all-cause readmission mortality rate 6 month compare 2 week post-treatment prophylaxis provide single course oral AL give part standard in-hospital care around time discharge .</detailed_description>
