	<brief_summary>Preterm newborns receive placental transfusion birth ( volume blood come placenta towards newborn till cord leave unclamped ) good neonatal outcome ( particular reduction intraventricular hemorrhage grade ) . The placental transfusion strategy perform preterm baby delivery delay cord clamp cord milking . Both experimental strategy explore contribution start breathe placental transfusion , perform small time frame ( 30-60 second delay clamp less 20 sec cord milking ) . To assist newborn bedside near deliver mother , leave cord unclamped , would allow explore contribution breathing , spontaneously start assisted initial step stabilization , early postnatal adaptation . The purpose present study ass feasibility large multicentre trial , whose primary outcome reduction composite outcome severe intraventricular hemorrhage , chronic lung disease mortality baby assist bedside placental circulation intact 3 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At delivery , cord clamp immediately , volume blood come placenta continue pass newborn : placental transfusion range 25 40 ml/kg body weight , depend gestational age , time cord clamping , position infant birth , onset respiration , administration uterotonics mother . Recent research study animal indicate possible physiological role placental transfusion first minute life , postnatal transition phase . During fetal life , oxygenate blood come placenta umbilical vein largely reach heart leave ventricle foramen ovale . So , birth , placenta guarantee leave ventricle pre-load , thus maintain cardiac output towards aorta epi-aortic vessel . At birth , cord clamp immediately , leave ventricle suddenly loose source filling leave ventricle preload become fully dependent pulmonary vein return lung . Pulmonary blood flow increase slowly birth newly bear start breathe , fact ventilation trigger fall pulmonary vascular resistance . The period cord clamp onset breathe indicate `` non respiring interval '' , newly bear receive oxygenate blood placenta yet lung . During period , cardiac output decrease , hemodynamic fluctuation associate reduced cerebral oxygenation demonstrate animal . Otherwise , cord maintain unclamped , blood come placenta umbilical vein continue fill left ventricle , onset newborn 's ventilation increase pulmonary blood flow venous return . Thus , delay cord clamp till start breathe would maintain left ventricle pre-load unchanged , demonstrated absence hemodynamic fluctuation associate reduced cerebral oxygenation animal study . These phenomenon probably responsible reduce incidence intra-ventricular hemorrhage baby receive placental transfusion . Recent meta-analysis preterm newborn demonstrate delayed cord clamp associate improvement cardiovascular stability reduce need inotropes , low incidence grade intra-ventricular hemorrhage necrotizing enterocolitis , low oxygen requirement 36 week post-menstrual age , less need red blood cell transfusion , apparently without severe short-term related morbidity adverse effect ; however , randomize trial yet investigate newly bear infant require resuscitation . Placental transfusion preterm baby may take long , may incomplete cord clamp within 30 90 second . This seem logical , term , two-thirds feto-placental circulation infant , whilst 30 week gestation , great proportion placenta . Also , umbilical vein small term , uterine contraction less efficient . Therefore , preterm baby start breathe prolonged placental transfusion would probably receive best benefit term improve outcomes . Cord milking ( pinch cord close mother run finger towards baby , usually 3 5 time ) suggest preterm birth mean obtain placental transfusion rapidly . This procedure take less 20 second perform thus allow timely resuscitation newborn , standard setting , need . Cord milk over-rides infant 's physiological control blood volume blood pressure , however , disrupts umbilical blood flow . Cord milking compare immediate cord clamp recently associate systematic review meta-analysis benefit ( less oxygen requirement 36w gestation , less IVH grade ) adverse effect immediate postnatal period preterm infant less 33 week gestational age ; however , study warrant assess effect cord milk neonatal long-term outcome . The hypothesis study assist preterm baby le 30 week gestation placental circulation intact allow well postnatal adaptation improve outcome neonatal period . For ethical reason control group receive cord milk instead immediate cord clamping , base recently publish result favor cord milk preterm baby .</detailed_description>
