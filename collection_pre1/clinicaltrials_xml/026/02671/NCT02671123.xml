	<brief_title>Does Co-registration OCT Angiography Reduce Geographic Miss Stent Implantation ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : When stent fail fully cover lesion , term `` geographic miss '' ( GM ) . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) intracoronary image modality high resolution conventional intracoronary ultrasound . Although OCT allow identification location culprit lesion side branch use automated measure , sometimes difficult identify exact segment correspond angiography . Recently , co-registration OCT angiography become available ; however , whether reduces incidence GM stenting unknown . Hypothesis : OCT reduce GM percutaneous coronary intervention . Objectives : 1 . Determine incidence GM define residual disease* significant edge dissection† proximal distal reference 2 . Determine incidence stent dislocation ( distance plan actual stented place ) 3 . Determine procedural finding ( additional stent , total fluoro time , total contrast volume ) - Minimum lumen area &lt; 4.0 mm2 presence significant residual plaque within 5 mm distal proximal stent edge . - A flap vessel wall &gt; 60° see ≥2 consecutive cross-section image within 5 mm distal proximal stent edge Study Design Methods : Single-center , prospective , randomize study . Consented subject undergo percutaneous coronary intervention divide 2 group randomly ( OCT co-registration v OCT without co-registration ) . After stent deployment guide OCT , dissection , residual disease stent edge , distance plan actual stent location assess use OCT angiography . Additional stent deployment , procedure time , total fluoroscopy time , total contrast volume also evaluate . Sample size consideration : OCT co-registration : 100 , OCT without co-registration : 100 ( α＝0.05 , β ＝0.2 ) . In retrospective evaluation , incidence residual disease ( lumen area &lt; 4.0 mm2 presence significant residual plaque ) significant stent edge dissection 36 % ( 18/50 , 34 % [ 17/50 ] residual stenosis , 4 % [ 2/50 ] significant edge dissection ) . Under assumption GM occur 36 % patient without co-registration 18 % patient co-registration , group 190 patient yield power 80 % ( 2-sided α=0.05 ) detect difference GM patient without co-registration . In order account patient drop non-evaluable OCT recording ( 5 % ) , total 200 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
