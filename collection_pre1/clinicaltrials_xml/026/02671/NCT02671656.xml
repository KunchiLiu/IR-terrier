	<brief_summary>Lowering level uric acid serum 6mg/dL long term key factor gout management success . Monitoring uricemia gout patient therefore important presently do laboratory serum sample obtain venous puncture . This study aim assess reliability immediate uricemia measurement blood sample obtain mere fingertip puncture , HumaSensplus system , commercially available EU . Results obtain Humasens device compare standard measurement technique serum reference technique ( liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy ) . If device appear reliable , allow self-measurement uric acid gouty patient , similar way diabetic patient measure glycaemia follow fingertip puncture . This improve patient monitoring management effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Reliability Device ( HumanSens Plus ) Allowing Immediate Measurement Uric Acid Blood Obtained Finger Tip Puncture .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study - ass validity capillary measure uric acid level HumaSens plus system compare measurement total blood uric acid level HumaSens plus system routine measurement serum uric acid standard validate automated colorimetric method ( primary objective ) . - look systematic bias confound factor ( secondary objective ) Methods Design : This mono-centric prospective study . Patients recruited diabetology day hospital hospital Lariboisière , Paris Data collection : For patient include Lariboisière Diabetology day hospital include study , serum uric acid level measure venous blood sample biochemistry laboratory use standard automate colorimetric method , presently routinely do liquid chromatography couple mass spectroscopy . In , addition , uric acid level also simultaneously measure capillary blood HumaSensplus system . Hematocrit , glucose , cholesterol triglyceride measure well venous blood sample take medication list . Planned analysis : Planned sample size : To obtain estimated intraclass correlation 0,800 , two-sided 95 % confidence interval width 0,100 , uric acid level measure twice subject , calculate need random sample 204 subject . Statistical analysis : Primary aim This study aim study reliability measurement acid uric level HumanSensplus laboratory measurement liquid chromatography couple mass spectroscopy serum venous blood . There structure replicate measurement sense nothing tie first second measurement one patient first second another . The study thus conform one-way random effect model . The data analyze use one-way random-effects ANOVA model . The estimator intraclass correlation coefficient With BMS=between-subject mean square , WMS=within-subject mean square k0 = number replicates . In study k0=2 . The intraclass correlation coefficient calculate two-sided 95 % CI provide comparison . In addition difference measurement plot mean measurement accordance Bland Altman . Secondary aim The search systematic bias effect confound factor ( hematocrit , glycemia , lipid concentration concomitant medication ) use different model multiple regression Logistic aspects Ethical aspect : Agreement seek local Ethics committee . All patient fully inform provide information form . The data enter excel database analyse anonymously . Fingertip glycaemia presently systematically obtain day hospital patient , addition fingertip uricaemia view substitute measurement systematic serum uric acid measurement presently do venous system biochemistry laboratory consider mere attempt improve routine patient care . Inclusion procedure : The study target 200 patient see diabetology day hospitalisation fulfil inclusion criterion . As 15 patient see diabetology day hospitalisation ward every day , estimate necessary patient sample size could obtain within 6 week .</detailed_description>
