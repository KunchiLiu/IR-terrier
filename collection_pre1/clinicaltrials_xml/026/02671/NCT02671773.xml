	<brief_summary>Previous work determine significant difference community bacteria find airway asthmatic patient compare found airway healthy people . It yet clear bacterial community similar patient asthma different people severe asthma , different type asthma asthma patient take different treatment . This important know difference bacteria present group may help explain people asthma feature disease . This research aim determine difference number type bacteria find airway asthmatic patient ( 1 ) different severity asthma ( 2 ) use different type inhale steroid treatment asthma . We detect DNA bacteria present phlegm sample patient . We also take measurement different component asthma see bacteria different people different type disease . As yet clear bacteria detect phlegm sample one person may differ different occasion , take one sample patient see similar time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main aim project determine microbiota composition correlate disease severity ( determine BTS step ) . Although initial study suggest asthmatic different severity may similar microbiota composition , direct evidence support assertion . Also , three main study area far use different sequence method , make comparison difficult . The relationship microbiota composition different subject clinical measure include bronchial hyperreactivity ( measure methacholine challenge ) pattern airway inflammation ( measure sputum differential cell count exhale nitric oxide level ) investigate . Comparisons also make sample asthmatic patient use inhaled steroid fluticasone use budesonide , evidence suggest fluticasone lead increase risk pneumonia non tuberculous mycobacterial disease certain patient group . Unpublished data ( Astra Zeneca ) suggest excess risk pneumonia fluticasone compare budesonide may pronounce least 12 month treatment inhale corticosteroid . Microbiota composition sputum sample evaluate conjunction standard microbiological culture sample allow comparison two method . In order ass reproducibility induce sputum method assess lung microbiota , repeat sputum sample take subgroup 20 patient within 24 hour collection first sample compare . A sample take subgroup patient 2 week later assess longitudinal stability bacterial population .</detailed_description>
