	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-center , observational study . Aim study evaluation preoperative transnasal fiberoscopy predictor difficult laryngoscopy intubation elective general anesthesia adult population . Unexpected difficult failed intubation serious , potentially fatal , occurrence induction general anesthesia . However , current strategy use predict ease intubation still sufficiently sensitive specific . Patients undergo schedule ENT ( Ear-Nose-Throat ) surgical intervention subject transnasal fibescopy , minimally invasive examination , part normal ENT evaluation surgery , accord guideline recruit center . During fiberoscopy , investigator collect many anatomical functional data upper airways patient . These data include collapse upper airway Muller maneuver , Cormack - Lehane scale see fiberoscopy , anatomy glottis epiglottis . The investigator also collect data preoperative evaluation make Anesthesiologist well effective difficulty laryngoscopy intubation encounter induction general anaesthesia , express Cormack - Lehane scale Intubation Difficulty Scale ( IDS ) describe literature . General anesthesia perform usual influenced fiberoptic evaluation Anesthesiologist blind , he/she free choose best anesthesiological plan his/her patient ; whether elective awake intubation choose , exclude patient study . For safety reason , exception blindness expect difficulty intubation &gt; 90 % ( report VAS scale ) ENT specialist , base upon physician 's experience . In case , talk Anesthesiologist patient exclude study . The researcher exclude study patient suspect confirm malignancy nose , mouth , pharynx larynx , well patient trachoestomy , active bleeding lesion plan elective awake intubation reason . To reduce confounders , fiberoscopy perform ENT specialist chosen limited pool ( three ) record subsequently review another one pool . Likewise , general anesthesia perform limited pool ( three ) Anesthesiologists expert ENT surgery . Preoperative data obtain fiberoscopy intraoperative data record Anesthesiologist match analyze , explore possibile relationship . In literature , relationship never demonstrate indagated . If prove , might give Anesthestiologist information prediction difficult laryngoscopy intubation , even beyond ENT surgery ; fact , whether fiberoscopy routinely carry surgical reason ( e.g . vascular surgery evaluation recurrent laryngeal nerve prior aortic surgey ) request Anesthesiologist him/herself moment preoperative evaluation , might guide different - hopefully safer - anesthesiological strategy .</detailed_description>
