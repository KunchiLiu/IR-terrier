	<brief_summary>A biological tool quantitative assessment Chronic Urticaria ( CU ) still need monitor biotherapies . CU consider sudden degranulation Mast cell / basophil without identify cause . It consider Mast cell/basophil abnormally high sensitivity CU trigger almost nothing ( high irritability ) . In allergy , basophils degranulation reproduce vitro allergen . Anti-IgE ( immunoglobulin E ) antibody mimic allergen trigger basophil dose dependent manner . If basophil abnormally sensitive CU , reproduce vitro low stimulation . The main objective project set method evidence abnormal basophil irritability look clinical significance . As many marker characterize basophil different state , researcher shall also look profile possibly associate CU basophile irritability . Such test could useful CU monitoring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mast cell key factor Urticaria physiopathology . Several mechanism hypothesize could either synergistic reveal different type urticaria . But mechanisms seem converge Mast cell release histamine product . These mechanism include auto-antibody / cytokine inappropriate production . However , internal dysregulation Mast cell also report , could either primary secondary extrinsic mediator mention already . Basophils closely related Mast cell , easily accessible usually serve surrogate clinical analysis allergy urticaria . Flow-cytometry ( FCM ) recent tool increase interest due exceptional capacity analysis large number cell , individually , high speed measure many parameter time . FCM extensively use characterization cell sub population several disease hematology disorder immunology among basophil . FCM gold standard ex vivo functional analysis basophil activation part diagnosis allergy . The present project aim explore phenotypic functional change could reflect dysregulation Urticaria . This would diagnosis physiopathological interest potential impact optimize disease monitoring treatment .</detailed_description>
