	<brief_title>To Determine Measurement Properties ACT African American Adolescent Population With Persistent Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>African Americans high rate asthma ( 11.2 % ) compare white ( 7.7 % ) , accord Centers Disease Control Prevention , asthma disproportionally well-controlled . African Americans high mortality healthcare utilization asthma . Their asthma severity likely underestimated `` main asthma provider '' . African-American adolescent particularly high risk asthma-related morbidity mortality . Because asthma control focus asthma care , assessment control critical step appropriate management . The two domain asthma control , impairment risk , evaluate role asthma play patient 's quality life functional capacity ongoing basis risk asthma present future adverse event . Although NAEPP guideline contain rubric asthma control base domain , thus represent `` gold standard '' asthma care , utilization may time-consuming cumbersome implement primary care office , primary care provider may unfamiliar use . Minorities see subspecialists less often Caucasians ( 28.3 % vs 41 % , p=0.001 ) , difference could explain age , gender , health insurance , education , employment , patient preference , frequency respiratory symptom . For primary care practice follow patient , remain imperative tool use gauge asthma control evaluate validated at-risk population . At time , approximately 17 questionnaire available use assessment asthma control , although well validate . Of , widely validate commonly use instrument Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) . The ACT self-administered questionnaire intend assess impairment domain past four week complete patient start age 12 . The ACT five question overall best score 25 . For primarily adult Caucasian population , ACT find valid , reliable , responsive instrument asthma control , cut-offs control well-controlled asthma ( &lt; 19 ) well minimal clinically important ( MIC ) difference ( 3 point ) identify . However , measurement property ACT lack African American adolescent asthma population . The landmark validation study ACT Schatz et al comprise large sample size 300 patient show cut-off score 19 distinguish well-controlled versus well-controlled asthmatic . However , mean age 35 study population , concern raise whether cut-off appropriate adolescent general . Moreover , concern raise application cut-offs different ethnic population . Recent study examine ACT pediatric adolescent population find high optimal cut point distinguish control classification ; group include European cohort well child Mexican descent Southern California . The ACT validate ethnically diverse population African American adolescent . The measurement property validity , reliability , responsiveness critical usefulness questionnaire clinical research setting . To date , unable identify study evaluate measurement property ACT at-risk minority population . Lung function measure include rubric assess asthma control NAEPP . Per recommendation , spirometry available physician care asthma patient use initiation treatment , change asthma control , every one two year . While subspecialists often access spirometry , office-based spirometry time-consuming , require technical ability staff training , equipment maintenance calibration , always available feasible use primary care physician office . Because spirometry may limit accessibility primary care provider , questionnaire quickly take lead role asthma management . However , African Americans perceive asthma symptom differently Caucasians . They report less nighttime awakening dyspnea , two symptom account 20 % ACT score , child less accurate describing perceive asthma control . This type under-reporting reflect false level asthma control query ACT lead inappropriate medical management spirometry utilize . Additionally , health literacy often underestimated . In review Diette approximately 500 mostly African American patient ask read asthma information , 27 % able read high school level , level health information instruction write . Patients limited health literacy chronic illness know less manage disease high likelihood poorly control disease health status compare counterpart higher health literacy . Due , IOM identify health literacy fundamental quality care also consider priority health-care quality disease prevention . Because currently use questionnaire often provide patient time intake clinic visit self-administration , high level health literacy minority adolescent population dangerous assumption must consider address utilization tool assessment asthma control primary care provider subspecialists alike .</detailed_description>
