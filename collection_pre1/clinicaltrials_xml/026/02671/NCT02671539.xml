	<brief_title>THOR - Tübingen Choroideremia Gene Therapy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study name : THOR - Tübingen Choroideremia gene therapy trial open label Phase 2 clinical trial use adeno-associated viral vector ( AAV2 ) encode Rab-escort protein 1 ( REP1 ) Phase : Phase II Indication : Adult male clinical phenotype choroideremia confirm molecular diagnosis null mutation gene encode REP1 Aim study : To assess anatomical functional outcome , well safety single subretinal injection rAAV2.REP1 subject genetically confirm choroideremia 24 month . Primary Endpoint : Change baseline best correct visual acuity treat eye , compare untreated control eye Study design : Open label monocenter study Study population : 6 male adult affect choroideremia Inclusion Criteria 1 . Participant willing able give inform consent participation study . 2 . Male age 18 year . 3 . Genetically confirm diagnosis choroideremia . Patients without confirmed mutation CHM gene , clinical phenotype typical choroideremia enrol meet follow three criterion : ( ) family history consistent X-linked inheritance , ( ii ) absent REP1 protein Western blot blood sample , ( iii ) normal RPE65 gene sequence . 4 . Active disease visible clinically within macula region 5 . Best-corrected visual acuity equal worse 6/9 ( 20/32 ; Decimal 0.63 ; LogMAR 0.2 ) good equal 6/60 ( 20/200 ; Decimal 0.1 ; LogMAR 1.0 ) study eye . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Female child participant ( age 18 ) 2 . Participants history amblyopia study eye 3 . Men unwilling use barrier contraception method , relevant 4 . Absence quantifiable visual function fellow eye ocular morbidity might confound use fellow eye long-term control . 5 . Any significant ocular non-ocular disease/disorder retinal surgery , opinion Investigator , may either put participant risk participation study , may influence result study , participant 's ability participate study . This would include take contraindication oral prednisolone , history gastric ulcer significant side effect . 6 . Participants participate another research study involve investigational product past 12 week , gene cellular therapy time prior study . 7 . Patients amblyopic eye exclude general , since evaluation primary endpoint presupposes ability fixate eye 8 . Prior intraocular surgery within six month 9 . Intolerance local anesthesia and/or contraindication IVT surgery ( anemia Hb &lt; 8g/dl , severe cardiovascular disease , severe coagulopathy , etc . ) 10 . High fever high fever disease , patient history autoimmune conditions/ systemic disease may ocular manifestation ( e.g . sarcoidosis ) neurodegenerative condition ( e.g . multiple sclerosis , neuromyelitis optica , Parkinson ` disease ) 11 . Patients suffer genetic mutation lead pathological retinal condition 12 . Patients treat oral corticoid within 14 day prior inclusion study entry Patient number : 6 Treatment : Each participant receive single treatment rAAV2.REP1 vector ( 0.1ml contain 1011 AAV2 genome particle ) administer subretinal injection vitrectomy operation . No placebo use . ln order minimize selection bias eye randomize either treatment control . Main criterion : Primary endpoint : Change baseline best correct visual acuity treat eye , compare untreated control eye 24 month vector administration Secondary endpoint : Absence vector related adverse reaction 24 month vector administration . Demonstration improve retinal anatomy and/or visual function best correct visual acuity treat eye compare untreated control eye 24 month vector administration . Statistical method : Summary statistic present eye ( Treated Eye versus Control Eye group ) . No formal statistical comparison perform ( p-value compute ) . For categorical/binary data , number proportion patient category present 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI ) . For continuous data , mean ( 95 % CI ) Standard Deviation ( SD ) present . The primary outcome measure proportion patient relative change baseline &gt; 5 ETDRS letter ( treat vs. untreated eye , change BL ) . At time point , change baseline ETDRS letter compute eye . The mean change baseline ETDRS letter present treated eye control eye group . At time point , change baseline percentage change baseline area autofluoresence compute eye mean present treated eye control eye group . With regard microperimetry , time point , change baseline mean sensitivity compute eye . The mean change baseline mean sensitivity present treated eye control eye group . Adverse event list . Other Investigator Sponsored Studies expect run similar protocol indication intervention . A meta-analysis Investigator Sponsored study plan . A separate Statistical Analysis Plan describe detail meta-analysis developed . Timetable : Planned trial period : 24 month Follow-up duration : 36 month The end trial date last treated patient completes test plan close-out visit .</detailed_description>
