	<brief_summary>This multi-centre , prospective randomise double-blinded cross study , recruit sub-population patient heart failure . All patient implant CRT ( Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy ) pacemaker one lead position His bundle order obtain direct His-bundle capture . There 2-month run-in period device active . A double-blinded cross-over design employ investigate effect His bundle pacing . Patients allocate random order six month treatment period follow two state ( 1 ) No pacing ; ( 2 ) AV optimise direct His-bundle pacing . Endpoint measurement take baseline , 6 month 12 month post randomisation . Treatment allocation blind endpoint assessor patient . 126 patient need detect expect effect size primary endpoint 90 % power . A total 160 patient recruit allow patient drop-out .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The His Optimised Pacing Evaluated Heart Failure Trial ( HOPE-HF ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enter study attend implantation CRT pacemaker device one lead position His bundle . This perform either patient 's local hospital Imperial College NHS healthcare Trust , later 4 month patient 's screening visit . All patient implant Pacemaker Implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) . In patient pace lead position right atrium ( typically right atrial appendage ) . All patient pacemaker lead position His bundle order obtain direct His-bundle capture . If possible successfully implant His-bundle lead selective direct His bundle capture non-selective capture &lt; 40ms prolongation QRS duration , lead implant lateral branch coronary sinus . In patient indication Implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) second ventricular lead implant lateral branch coronary sinus . If direct His pace successfully achieve lead position RV apex . In patient indication Implantable cardioverter defibrillator ICD lead position right ventricle ( either RV apex RV septum ) . AV delay optimisation perform use acute non-invasive blood pressure acquire use Finometer device ( Finapres Medical system , Netherlands ) . The BHF ( British Heart Foundation ) alternation protocol use order minimise effect background noise . After implantation device 2 month run-in period prior randomisation , device program deliver His bundle pace therapy period . ( Back pace defibrillator function enable ) . Two month patient implanted device , patient randomise either receive active pacing treatment back pacing ( pacemaker program VVI 30 bpm ) . After 6 month cross alternative treatment arm . Treatment allocation obtain use Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ) program randomisation schedule provide trial statistician . Appropriate block use .</detailed_description>
