	<detailed_description>The understanding NSCLC undergo rapid evolution one disease treat empirically choose , costly cytotoxic chemotherapy , laden adverse effect benefit last week month , rapidly grow set genomically defined disease match targeted therapy markedly improve outcome , include response rate 70-80 % survival often measure year rather month . The need comprehensive genomic profiling test able accommodate expand list genomic marker without necessitate new biopsy rise cost convenience , medical necessity . In October 2014 , National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) specifically recommend patient metastatic NSCLC undergo `` broad molecular profiling '' goal identify rare driver mutation effective drug may already available , appropriately counsel patient regard availability clinical trial , include EGFR ALK , also BRAF , ERBB2 ( HER2 ) , MET , RET ROS1 . For example , ERBB2 alterations certainly common breast cancer , alteration also find NSCLC thus would predict response target therapy anti-HER2 agent . Specifically , additional targetable alteration indicate greatly increase likelihood response respective target treatment , even though treatment would consider 'off-label ' lung cancer ( e.g . trastuzumab afatinib target patient ERBB2 alteration ; crizotinib MET amplification ROS1 rearrangement ) , on-label drug approve lung cancer ( e.g . crizotinib target patient ALK rearrangement ) . Problems Genomic Testing : The substantial increase number recommend targetable alteration NSCLC present multiple clinical logistic challenge current model gene-by-gene testing . These include non-validated testing , miss alteration could match targeted therapy , insufficient tissue due sequential parallel testing , unacceptably long turnaround time , physician frustration confusion relate delay obtain needed result complex interpretation multiple report . Based recent publication , reasonable anticipate list targetable alteration evaluate 'standard care ' continue expand . This reality make current model individual test gene-by-gene model unsustainable . For example traditional testing would require multiple modality , include polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -based test , capillary sequencing , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) -based test , mass spectrometry-based sizing assay . Insufficient tissue supply test particular problem . Traditional pathologic evaluation , include test seven targetable alteration NCCN guideline , may require 26 slide -- tissue requirement usually beyond amount obtain minimally invasive biopsy . Competing demand scarce tissue may place clinician uncomfortable position guess test run slide run , alternatively , consider conduct additional biopsy procedure . These challenge grow complexity biopsy become less invasive , number molecular marker target therapeutic option increase , evidence new marker becomes strong . FoundationOne comprehensive genomic profile applies next generation sequence unique manner identify 4 type genomic alteration across gene know unambiguous driver solid tumor high accuracy . The test simultaneously sequence cod region 315 cancer-related gene plus intron 28 gene often rearrange altered cancer typical median depth coverage great 500X . Each cover read represent unique DNA fragment enable highly sensitive specific detection genomic alteration occur low frequency due tumor heterogeneity , low tumor purity small tissue sample . FoundationOne detect class genomic alteration , include base substitution , insertion deletion ( indels ) , copy number alteration ( CNAs ) rearrangements use small , routine FFPE sample ( include core fine needle biopsy ) . Foundation Medicine recently collaborate Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ( MSKCC ) evaluate clinical utility approach . After appropriate institutional approval , group patient advance NSCLC complete in-house clinical test CLIA-accredited MSKCC lab test negative use conventional diagnostics , alive receive systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy identify . Before tested use FoundationOne , 24 first 34 patient require additional biopsy complete initial requisite testing . In 9 34 clinical case , FoundationOne could perform due lack available tissue initial round MSKCC test . FoundationOne successfully perform 25 patient uncover one genomic alteration link target agent base NCCN guideline 36 % ( 9/25 case ) target agent available open clinical trial MSKCC 32 % ( 8/25 ) patient . This approach simultaneously analyze multiple gene class genomic alteration require clinical care readily adapt efficiently incorporate rapidly expand landscape targetable alteration . Study Design : This non-randomized observational comparative study various cohort base physician diagnostic pattern care biologic genomic profile status . Treatment Subjects 1 . All eligible patient ( consecutive ) stage IV non-small cell lung cancer treat COTA center enrol follow observational study . 2 . All physician COTA center remind genomic profile non-small cell lung cancer technically possible circumstance recommend per national guideline . For patient Horizon Blue Cross insurance physician also inform FoundationOne genomic profile financially covered test . It however physician 's independent choice whether order diagnostic test and/or test perform , without influence protocol study team . 3 . If perform , result genomic profile lung cancer specimen record COTA database , regardless type site test . 4 . Treatment patient sole discretion physician . Time initiation therapy first oncology visit , time biopsy record . Time biopsy receipt genomic profiling also record . 5 . If mutation EGFR ALK rearrangement identify physician encouraged treat patient approve targeted agent per current national guideline . If ROS fusion identify physician also encourage consider label use approve targeted therapy ( ie , crizotinib ) . 6 If `` actionable '' mutation identify approve targeted therapy physician notify available research trial might consider . However , decision utilize specific agent sole discretion treat physician . To expand opportunity offer targeted therapy , participate COTA center encourage open national trial lung cancer . The COTA protocol team meet individual center assist research start-up desire . Eligibility participation target therapy trial per individual protocol . Consent study participation separate protocol . 7 At sole discretion treat physician patient may treat chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery mean . Consent treatment obtain treatment team , separate observational study , accordance policy procedures treat center . 8 Patients allocate one seven cohort base physician choice genomic profiling use 9 All patient track use COTA database use standard collection field lung cancer , include limited demographic , smoke history , treatment toxicity , survival outcome . 10 All patient complete ECOG performance score minimum monthly per usual protocol center . 11 All patient complete patient report Living Cancer ( LWC ) instrument time diagnosis monthly thereafter . Response Assessments Planned Analyses 1 . The primary endpoint relate overall survival . All subject follow overall survival . Date death record COTA database . 2 . The primary endpoint overall survival duration ( median ) 2 year survival rate patient within follow cohort : Cohorts A+B+C versus Cohorts D+E+F+G ( patient undergo FoundationOne assay test vs undergoing test ) The analysis perform entire study population separately non-squamous cell lung cancer histology . 3 . The key secondary endpoint overall survival duration ( median ) 2 year survival rate patient within follow cohort ( additional comparison may perform include repeat analysis non-squamous histology ) : Cohorts A v B v C v D v E v F v G Cohorts A+D versus Cohorts B+C+E+F+G ( patient actionable mutation receive targeted therapy vs ) Cohorts A+B+D+E versus Cohorts C+F+G ( patient actionable mutation regardless treatment v without target ) Cohorts A+B+C+D+E+F versus Cohort G ( patient undergo test v undergo test ) Cohort A versus Cohorts B+C+D+E+F+G ( patient receive target therapy base FoundationOne assay test v ) 4 . Frequency genomic mutation document FoundationOne assay molecular profiling record 5 . A secondary endpoint determine whether identification actionable genomic mutation increase FoundationOne assay versus methodology . The retrospective RCCA rate mutational identification 22 % use non-Foundation Medicine testing . In addition ( historical comparison ) comparison identify mutation rate Cohorts A+B+C v Cohorts D+E+F perform . The analysis perform entire cohort non-squamous histology . 6 . Total cost care obtain via COTA source available . 7 . A secondary endpoint determine whether use FoundationOne test impact total cost . Several comparison perform include comparison Cohorts A+B+C v D+E+F+G ( FM v ) , comparison A+B+C v D+E+F ( FM vs genomic testing ) , comparison A+D v B+C+E+F+G ( target therapy use v ) 8 .
