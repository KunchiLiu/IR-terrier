	<brief_summary>This randomize control trial determine effect short term high intensity interval training ( HIIT ) physical fitness , elderly patient group active cancer , prior surgical resection . Half recruit patient act control group half undergo HIIT protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative HIIT Elderly Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High intensity interval training ( HIIT ) show achieve similar study well improvement aerobic fitness versus traditional endurance base exercise time period . HIIT also show produce improvement short timescale method , region 2-6 week . One widely report barrier exercise time availability , HIIT training may favorable option increase fitness total time spend exercise significantly less method . HIIT induce improvement cardiovascular parameter healthy elderly subject , investigator aim investigate whether improvement match patient cancer elucidate mechanism behind improvement see type training .</detailed_description>
