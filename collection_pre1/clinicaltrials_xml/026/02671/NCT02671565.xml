	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) degenerative joint disease imbalance breakdown repair joint tissue.Intraarticular hyaluronic acid ( HA ) injection use management knee OA . The pooled estimate randomize clinical trial various meta-analyses consistent conclusion , conclude benefit others conclude small benefit ( reduce pain improve daily function ) overall benefit ( alleviate pain well improve daily function ) .The variation conclusion due heterogeneity methodology clinical trial include meta-analyses well difference interpretation clinical findings.Furthermore , trial ( 63 % ) evaluate efficacy HA industry fund , raise concern publication bias . Furthermore Although evidence favoring use HA injection limit , injection still significant market share annual sale $ 725 million per year . Given high dollar amount spend intervention , evaluation effectiveness real world set important . Currently , limit inconclusive evidence support use HA injection management knee OA . The primary objective current study evaluate effectiveness HA injection management knee OA . Specifically , investigator compare risk surgical intervention knee primary outcome among knee OA patient expose HA injection expose HA injection ( HA non-users ) expose intra-articular corticosteroid ( CS ) injection . Three separate outcome definition , include : ) composite surgical outcome measure ( include total knee replacement , partial knee replacement , arthroscopic procedure , osteotomy free-floating inter-positional device ) , ii ) total partial knee replacement iii ) total knee replacement ( TKR ) use compare effectiveness HA user HA non-users CS user . This study conduct use knee OA patient age 40 year Lifelink Plus claim data ( 2006-2015 ) . Knee OA patient specialist visit recent history medication use pain management ( proxy moderate-severe pain ) identify . Patients classify 3 group : 1 ) HA user , 2 ) CS user 3 ) HA non-users base exposure/non-exposure intervention within first 90 day specialist visit . HA user match separately two comparison ( CS user HA non-users ) group use propensity score matching approach reduce imbalance intervention comparison group . HA user match separately comparison group ( 1:1 ratio ) use greedy match approach within predefined caliper ( 0.2 pool standard deviation logit PS ) . Cox model use compare risk 1 ) surgical intervention knee , 2 ) TKR partial knee replacement 3 ) TKR , among HA user comparison group . For comparison , investigator use four approach compare risk outcome measure : 1 ) Unadjusted bivariate analysis , 2 ) Adjusted multivariate analysis , 3 ) Propensity score-matched sample 4 ) Inverse probability weighting ( IPW ) use propensity score .</detailed_description>
