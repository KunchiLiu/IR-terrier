	<detailed_description>Translational study effect Neural Mobilization patient lomboisquiatalgia The spinal nerve injury human often result neuropathic pain characterize spontaneous burn pain accompany allodynia hyperalgesia [ 1 ] . These sign symptom occur continuous presence ectopic focus afferent peripheral nervous system ( peripheral sensitization ) central nervous system ( CNS ) ( central sensitization ) . After traumatic experience peripheral sensitization central sensitization contributes appearance poorly adaptive response spinal cord well brain , contribute chronicity maintenance neuropathic pain [ 2 , 3 ] . The pain-induced neuropathy currently associate involvement glial cell locate spinal cord [ 4 , 5 ] . Glial cell synthesize several substance , many also release nociceptive neuron modulate pain response , among mention prostaglandin , glutamate , arachidonic acid , nitric oxide cytokine pro inflammatory [ 6-9 ] . Pro-inflammatory cytokine appear involve hyperalgesia mechanical allodynia arise nerve injury due compression . Many study demonstrate model peripheral nerve trunk ischemia , rat , occur increase pro-inflammatory cytokine may relate myelin damage edema [ 10 , 11 ] . Furthermore , study use nerve compression model , increase identify interleukin ( IL-6 TNF ) rat allodynia [ 12 ] . In sense , interleukin ( IL ) proteins produce T group many cell involve IL activation lymphocyte , effect IL specific group cell express specific receptor identify number : IL-1 , IL4 , IL-6 , IL-10 [ 13 ] . Kraychete et . al . ( 2009 ) , analyze mean blood sample level pro-inflammatory cytokine plasma patient without neuropathic pain , find patient neuropathy high level cytokine [ 14 ] . Kukkar et . al . ( 2012 ) , model neuropathic pain ( CCI ) observe increase TNF-α level sciatic nerve treatment aliskiren ( anti-hipertensive drug ) decrease TNF-α consequent improvement nociception [ 15 ] . In clinical practice , extensively report neuropathic pain difficult treat due inadequate understanding cellular molecular mechanism involve development maintenance kind pain [ 16 , 17 ] . The therapeutic option control neuropathic pain increase recent year [ 18 ] . However , responses treatment still satisfactory . The neurosurgical treatment include pharmacological treatment , antidepressant , anticonvulsant , gabapentin , carbamazepine , systemic administration local anesthetic , topical agent , narcotic analgesic non-narcotic antiarrhythmic [ 17 , 18 ] . Still , complementary non-invasive non-pharmacological treatment , find literature , use therapeutic resource rehabilitation , depend kinf injury . In context , Neural Mobilization technique show excellent prognosis patient differents kind pain , besides advantage , low operating cost , easy use adverse effect [ 19 ] . Neural Mobilization noninvasive technique use physiotherapist , technique aim , restore mobility elasticity peripheral nervous system strain impose nerve trunk , root , nerve , spinal cord wrap , meninges due imposition movement joint angle [ 20 ] . Currently , technique use method evaluation treatment several disease affect central nervous system ( Stroke ) peripheral ( herniated discs nerve impingement ) structure , muscle due exist integration musculoskeletal system nervous system [ 19 , 21-23 ] . The healthy relationship , away injury , peripheral nerve locomotor system respect tissue interface allow individual move free without pain [ 24 ] . Research Dworkin et al. , ( 2007 ) point Neural mobilization effective condition musculoskeletal injury functional pathological diagnosis [ 21 ] . However , author mention musculoskeletal condition kind neural mobilization perform . Also depend clinical condition patient therapy may include treatment plan . Our group study last six year , standardize technique Neural Mobilization ( MOB ) rat . Encouraging result find use treatment protocol . We demonstrate MOB reduce nociceptive frame , involvement opioid receptor central nervous system ( PAG ) peripheral ( DRG ) , involvement substance P , TRPV 1 , NGF , PO ( protein zero ) , intense regeneration process sciatic nerve , exponential increase muscle strength [ 25-28,34 ] . Thus , believe Neural Mobilization technique , basic research , appear effective antinociceptive process . EXPECTED RESULTS : Is consensus therapeutic alternative treatment neuropathic pain need . Physical therapy show Neural Mobilization technique efetive pain control . This project become important lack consistent control , randomize double blind , demonstrate benefit effect Neural Mobilization technique patient neuropathic pain . The lomboisquiatalgia characterized narrow intervertebral foramen lumbar vertebrae spinal nerve projection site . It clinical complication difficult diagnose easy confuse herniated disc , piriformis syndrome even osteoarthritis disc . The isquiatalgia induce nerve root compression ( local projection root form sciatic nerve L3 L4 L5 S1 ) , often cause protrusion nucleus pulposus virtue disruption fibrous ring symphysis intervertebral [ 30 ] . Neural mobilization technique able induces antinociceptive effect model cronic pain , reason important clinical tool treatment patient neuropathic pain [ 28 , 20 , 31 ] . Thus , believe need perform , randomize , control frequently session time treatment bring basic research clinic order well understand mechanism involve kind pain . In way , contribute effectively understand mechanism involve rehabilitation process patient , correlate improvement pain consequent improvement life patient . AINS Evaluate effect Neural Mobilization technique quality life , biochemical change patient lomboisquiatalgia use : - Check immediate effect neural mobilization technique pain patient lomboisquiatalgia pain scale ; - Check analysis Neural mobilization technique increase functional patient lomboisquiatalgia ; - Examine impact treatment Neural Mobilization pro- anti inflammatory citokynes ( IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNFa fractalquina ) analysis patient blood tissue ; - Check possible adverse effect Neural Mobilization technique patient lomboisquiatalgia . SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND THE MEANS AND METHODS TO OVERCOME THEM - Study ethic design : randomize , control , double-blind , accordance ethical standard Declaration Helsinki , approve Ethics Committee Research Human Subjects University Nove , São Paulo , SP , Brazil ( 2 44079115.1.1001.5511 ) . - Participants : Subjects recruit Integrated Health Clinic University Nove Sao Paulo / SP , even phone contact , e-mail letter orthopedic doctor , clinician neurologist . Potentially eligible subject invite interview screen procedure perform physiotherapist . After eligibility , subject sign Term Free Clear ( TCLE ) , accord Resolution 196/96 National Health Council , confirm participation survey . - Calculation sample : The sample size calculate base Analog Scale pain , consider primary end point . To end , variance report study Murphy et al. , 2006 , whose objective evaluate Neural mobilization technique treatment lumbar spinal stenosis . Considering mean standard deviation pre- intervention post-intervention study , alpha value ( α ) 0.05 90 % power test , determine 40 subject require , It 20 experimental group 20 control group [ 32 ] . Evaluation outcomes - Visual Analogue Scale : The primary outcome interest assess Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . The VAS assist assessment pain intensity participant . - Questionnaire WHOQOL-BREF : The WHOQOL-bref questionnaire specific questionnaire , short quick application , develop World Health Organization ( WHO ) order standardize assessment quality life . - Disability Questionnaire Roland Morris - RMDQ : Roland Morris develop 1983 questionnaire assess functional disability patient low back pain . - Oswestry Disability Index ( ODQ - version 2.0 ) : The Oswestry disability Index ( Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire ( ODQ ) aim assess dysfunction individual low back pain analyzing activity daily live . - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurement cytokine : To assess impact Neural Mobilization technical front interleukin pro- anti-inflammatory collect blood tissue necessary ( blood collection follow manual technique collection ministry Health blood [ 33 ] patient enzyme immunoassay specific cytokine ) . Will make two blood collection , original measure ( first session ) last session ( tenth session ) treatment . The blood tissue initially store collection centrifuge 20 minute 3000 rpm . For dosage fractalkine , cytokine ( IL-1β , IL-6 IL-10 TNF-α ) specific reagent use Milliplex®TM Map Kit ( Millipore Corporation , Darmstadt- Germany ) accord protocol specify manufacturer .
