	<brief_title>A Multicenter Randomized Double-blind Clinical Study Evaluated Safety , Pharmacokinetic Pharmacodynamic Characteristics Roflumilast COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Roflumilast product approve treatment severe chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) approve dose 500μg daily . This study primarily design see whether alternation dose improve tolerability Roflumilast COPD patient . Therefore one three patient start roflumilast therapy lower dose 250μg/375μg daily , another one three take 500μg tablet every day ( one placebo every day ) . Furthermore , study evaluate safety pharmacokinetics different dose roflumilast China COPD patient . Lastly , study investigate body roflumilast . Patients history COPD least last 12 month former smoker current smoker history least 10 pack year invited participate . The Randomization visit consider Baseline visit participant discontinue Main Period continue Down-Titration Period Day 1 Down Titration consider BaselineDT .</detailed_description>
