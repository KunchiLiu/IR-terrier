	<brief_summary>Microarray experiment assess expression thousand gene provide vast amount information . Because molecular requirement different process related playback , hypothesis may apt semen sample technical assume molecular difference RNA content messenger gene expression profile They get semen sample gestation versus . In attempt give functional data obtain view , find many gene donor obtain gestation , differentially express playback related process donor get pregnant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determining Genetic Profile Semen Donors With Pregnancy , Donor Versus Pregnancy Obtained TRA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MRNA assembly characterize use microarrays semen sample donor include donation program clinic . This process perform donor generate least 3 pregnancy compare sample , however , function gestation assist reproduction technique use . Consequently , differential expression gene identify assisted reproduction treatment cycle IAD , IVF ICSI .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>IAD group Younger 37 year , natural cycle stimulate apparently problem infertility follow : Polycystic ovary syndrome . Endometriosis . ovarian failure . Lack tubal patency ( Both fallopian tube must submit permeability ) . alter hormonal profile ( High level FSH , LH , testosterone androstenedione ) . Anovulation . Uterine malformation ( uterine septum , bicorne , didelphic unicorn . ) Ovarian cyst tumor . Pelvic inflammatory disease . Obesity ( Women BMI &gt; 30 ) . Thyroid Disease . Diabetes mellitus . renal adrenal disease . toxic habit ( smoking , alcohol drug abuse ) . IVF group Couples undergo IVF egg donation invoke program . Therefore , try cycle two gamete donor . All egg donor fertility proven , must able take shape within program egg donation naturally . The recipient woman ( patient ) present Endometriosis . Uterine malformation ( uterine septum , bicorne , didelphic unicorn . ) previous implantation failure . cyst , polyp uterine tumor . Pelvic inflammatory disease . Obesity ( Women BMI &gt; 30 ) Thyroid Disease . Diabetes mellitus . Renal adrenal disease , toxic habit ( smoking , alcohol drug abuse ) ICSI group Couples undergo ICSI invoke egg donation program . In addition , donor oocytes must prove fertility , able take shape within egg donation program naturally . The recipient woman ( patient ) present Endometriosis . Uterine malformation ( uterine septum , bicorne , didelphic unicorn . ) previous implantation failure . cyst , polyp uterine tumor . Pelvic inflammatory disease . Obesity ( Women BMI &gt; 30 ) Thyroid Disease . Diabetes mellitus . Renal adrenal disease , toxic habit ( smoking , alcohol drug abuse )</criteria>
