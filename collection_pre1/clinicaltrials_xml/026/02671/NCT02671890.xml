	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I trial study side effect best dose disulfiram give together gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient solid tumor remove surgery ( unresectable ) pancreatic cancer spread place body ( metastatic ) compare whether disulfiram gemcitabine hydrochloride may reduce tumor induced muscle loss . Weight loss occur pancreatic cancer patient common multitude cancer . Patients metastatic cancer weight loss sometimes able receive treatment due physical weakness debility . Disulfiram potential inhibitor muscle degradation may reduce tumor induced muscle wasting . Disulfiram may also help gemcitabine hydrochloride work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether give gemcitabine hydrochloride without disulfiram well treatment unresectable solid tumor metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Disulfiram Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Unresectable Solid Tumors Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination disulfiram gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) unresectable solid tumor cancer patient ( Cohort 1 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe adverse event profile associate combination disulfiram gemcitabine ( Cohort 2 ) . II . To describe change muscle area L3 level baseline 28 35 day treatment disulfiram/gemcitabine placebo/gemcitabine ( Cohort 2 ) . III . To describe change fist-grip strength baseline 28 35 day treatment disulfiram/gemcitabine placebo/gemcitabine ( Cohort 2 ) . IV . To describe overall survival pancreas cancer patient disulfiram/gemcitabine placebo/gemcitabine ( Cohort 2 ) . V. To estimate response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria around 1 month post-treatment patient receive disulfiram/gemcitabine placebo/gemcitabine ( Cohort 2 ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect disulfiram gemcitabine ubiquitin proteasome autophagy pathway within muscle , assess mean muscle biopsy perform baseline 28 35 day treatment ( Cohort 2 ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study disulfiram . COHORT I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 disulfiram orally ( PO ) day 1-28 day 1-35 . COHORT II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 disulfiram PO every day daily day 1-28 day 1-35 . ARM II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 placebo PO every day daily day 1-28 day 1-35 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
