	<brief_summary>This switch study ass non-inferiority ( term efficacy safety ) darunavir ( boost ritonavir , DRV/r 400mg/100mg daily ) compare lopinavir ( boost ritonavir , LPV/r total dose 800mg/200mg daily ) , combination nucleoside backbone , administer second line therapy HIV positive individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Low-dose Darunavir Switch Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label randomise , parallel group , phase 3b , switch study demonstrate non-inferiority low-dose boost darunavir ( DRV/RTV 400/100 mg daily ) compare boost lopinavir-based ( LPV/RTV 800/200 mg daily ) second-line regimen administer 48 week combination two nucleos ( ) ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor patient infect HIV-1 virologically suppress stable standard second-line regimen . All medication provide open-label design . Patients virologically suppress stable standard second-line regimen recruit study . There concern switch patient may result virological failure study aim demonstrate non-inferiority darunavir compare Lopinavir . In case , investigator ensure virological failure investigate patient switch back standard care immediately . Participants patient receive HIV treatment public clinic . Interested patient invite study , information give , give write informed consent screen , eligible enrol study . Each enrol participant follow-up week 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 ( exit visit ) enrolment date . Data collect use ethics-approved worksheet , capture REDCap . The data manager ensure data correct complete perform data verification - physical electronic . Internal quality control perform dedicated staff base study quality plan implement . The external study monitor perform 100 % eligibility check sign informed consent addition source verification periodic site visit accord monitoring plan implement . Findings monitor implement form data/procedure correction per good clinical practice , relevant staff train document accordingly . Participants ' record cod store lockable cabinet . Only study staff access participant ' record . All electronic document relate study store password-protected computer accessible study staff . Study staff allow share password among anyone outside study team . Designed non-inferiority fashion , study enrol approximately 300 participant 80 % power detect 10 % non-inferiority margin per protocol ( PP ) analysis . A Data Safety Management Board ( DSMB ) oversee review interim data report . At close study , result disseminate participant , scientific community , well updated clinicaltrial.gov .</detailed_description>
