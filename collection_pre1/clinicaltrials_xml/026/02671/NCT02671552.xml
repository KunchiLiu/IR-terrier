	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial compare image result contrast-enhanced ultrasound contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) , current clinical standard , predict treatment response patient kidney cancer undergo cryosurgery ( procedure extremely cold liquid instrument call cryoprobe use freeze destroy abnormal tissue ) . Using contrast-enhanced ultrasound involve dye may help patient avoid side effect dye usually use MRI CT may help doctor measure blood flow determine whether cryosurgery procedure treat kidney tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasound use successfully evaluate cryoablation ( cryosurgery ) renal cell carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound provide reliable tool characterization renal mass prior cryoablation . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare harmonic imaging ( current industry standard contrast imaging ) subharmonic imaging ( novel , improve contrast imaging technique ) two aim list . OUTLINE : Patients receive perflutren protein-type A microspheres intravenously ( IV ) undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging morning prior cryosurgery 3-4 month post treatment MRI CT follow .</detailed_description>
