	<brief_summary>Poor oral health greatly impact quality life also impact overall health . For instance , research suggest poor oral health may associate systemic disease diabetes , heart disease , stroke . Therefore , need investigate cause poor oral health . The idea athlete may propensity dental caries gain traction . There recent report high level dental caries , dental erosion periodontal disease among elite soccer player compare general public athlete wide range sport . However , date , study investigate oral microbiome athlete . Many factor affect development dental caries , include host factor , diet , microorganisms present oral cavity . More 700 type bacterial specie detect oral cavity , identify play significant role development oral disease . Streptococcus mutans main specie involve dental decay various lactobacillus also involved disease process . Treponema denticola , Porphyromonas ginigivalis , Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans main specie involve periodontal disease . It currently know change collective oral microbiome foster impede development pathogen . Complex microbe-host interaction occur allow progression oral disease , host nutrition hygiene play significant role . Endurance athletes widely consume variety sport drink , gel , energy bar supplementation electrolytes carbohydrate . The consumption food lead pH drop oral cavity may contribute tooth erosion demineralization . Oral disease may also exacerbate fluid electrolyte deficit impede saliva flow exercise . However , several study fail demonstrate clear link sport drink increase risk dental caries among athlete . Dental caries cause microorganisms oral cavity . These microbe may affect host factor nutrition progression oral disease . Due document prevalence dental caries athletes lack clear connection sport drink dental caries , investigator propose investigate correlation may exist exercise oral microbiome .</brief_summary>
