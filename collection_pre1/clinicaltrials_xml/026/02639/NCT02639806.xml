	<brief_title>General Anesthesia Endovascular Thrombectomy ; A Pilot Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label pilot study , compare intravascular thrombectomy patient treat use either general anesthetic ( prospective arm ) local anesthetic sedation ( retrospective arm ) , blind outcome evaluation . New evidence establish addition endovascular thrombectomy large , and/or proximal occlusion improve outcome addition , and/or place tPA therapy . There randomized prospective trial assess relationship anesthesia outcomes procedure . This procedure routinely perform either local anesthetic sedation general anesthesia ( GA ) . The choice two technique largely institution base . Currently Saskatoon Health Region ( SHR ) endovascular thrombectomy perform general anesthesia due operator preference optimization surgical condition . In United States Canadian center , procedure perform safely local anesthesia without sedation . Several retrospective trial suggest general anesthetic associate poor outcome . It suggest general anesthesia result delay time procedural start since require presence anesthesiologist procedure perform sedation without extra personnel . It also propose induction general anesthesia cause decrease blood pressure decrease collateral perfusion result cellular hypoxia . Anesthesiologists , however , able expertly manipulate hemodynamic parameter general anesthesia specific requirement operator potentially create optimal tissue oxygenation condition . There need prospective trial ass effect general anesthetic patient outcome endovascular thrombectomy . At time , premature conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Therefore pilot study , adult acute ischemic stroke participant undergo intravascular thrombectomy Saskatchewan receive general anesthetic per current practice , data collect prospectively . This cohort participant compare participant underwent procedure another study , receive local anesthesia sedation . Approximately 77 prospective participant recruit prospective arm study .</detailed_description>
