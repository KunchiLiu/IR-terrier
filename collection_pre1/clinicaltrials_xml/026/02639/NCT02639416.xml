	<brief_summary>Children complicate severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) , inability take adequate feed , infection diarrhoea , require in-patient management . Despite follow well-established World Health Organisation ( WHO ) protocol , outcomes poor . Case fatality often exceed 20 % . Amongst survivor discharge home , many subsequently die , long-term poor growth recurrence SAM . It long recognize child SAM intestinal inflammation persist despite management accord WHO guideline . The inflammation think result increase exposure microbial pathogen gut area poor sanitation . The damage lining intestine impairs food digestion absorption , likely allow gut bacteria enter blood stream cause sepsis also expose gut immune cell microbial food antigen cause inflammation persist . Failure treat intestinal inflammation likely contribute poor response treatment poor long-term outcome many child SAM . The intestinal inflammation see SAM similar occurs food intolerance ( e.g . intolerance cow 's milk protein ) inflammatory bowel disease . In condition , inflammation treat effectively hypoallergenic ( `` elemental '' ) anti-inflammatory ( `` polymeric '' ) formula . These nutritionally complete feed similar composition feed use nutritional rehabilitation SAM . We aim undertake pilot study see elemental and/or polymeric formula tolerate child SAM help reduce intestinal inflammation . We also aim learn intestinal inflammation general occur SAM observe carefully effect specific formulae in-depth metabolic analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypoallergenic Anti-inflammatory Feeds Malawian Children With Severe Acute Malnutrition ( SAM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We study child admit Moyo ward Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital , Blantyre , Malawi complicate SAM . Following informed consent , child recruit complete initial stabilisation phase management enter transition phase nutritional rehabilitation . They randomly allocate one 3 arm , either 1 ) standard feed ( F-100 and/or ready-to-use therapeutic feed ) , 2 ) polymeric therapeutic formula 3 ) elemental therapeutic formula . The alternative feed supplement micronutrient equivalent composition F-100 . All child remain admitted ward 2 week receive exclusively allocate formula . All aspect management SAM follow current practice base WHO guideline .</detailed_description>
