	<brief_summary>Direct laryngoscopy intubation essential initial aspect airway access general anesthesia . To perform procedure effectively , require adequate mouth opening , head neck movement , normal temporo-mandibular joint mobility . Any issue three result compromise upper airway outset condition know anticipated difficult airway , i.e . airway difficult access conventional laryngoscopy intubation method . To overcome difficulty , either one resort newer advance technique equipment available conventional technique need refine modified suit requirement . While former require extraordinary expertise finance , option difficult achieve develop country ; latter warrant focus interest develop alternative approach set equipment . Since submucous fibrosis associate restrict mouth open take proposition epidemic owe widespread use betel nut tobacco ; patient , require surgery , difficult candidate GA airway control . The fact , arrive pre-surgical candidate , variable degree mouth open restriction , approach strategy , may amenable conventional control airway . If investigator paint patient mouth restriction difficult airway , result uncalled surgical , economic , health system psychological burden . Therefore , prudent undertake research relate refinement airway access technique easily available , cheap user- friendly equipment ( conventional laryngoscope ) , proportion state burden reduce . In view , investigator plan undertake study enhance work knowledge conventional laryngoscope ( Macintosh ) facilitate way control airway difficulty secondary mouth open restriction . Investigators believe prospective knowledge thus generate would help u identify whether feasibility conventional airway management alternative advanced access technique need first place . This prevent undue cancellation , delayed surgery , patient morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Functional Dimensions Macintosh Laryngoscope Blade During Direct Laryngoscopy Patients With Normal Mouth Opening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper airway access one essential component general anaesthesia , often , gain direct laryngoscopy follow tracheal intubation . While direct laryngoscopy depend laryngoscope blade design anesthetist ' skill set , ease tracheal intubation influence line-of-view glottis gain laryngoscopy maneuver . In patient normal mouth opening ( â‰¥4.0 cm ) , act conventional airway access difficult give neck extension TMJ joint mobility within normal limit . Conversely , become difficult patient mouth open restriction , hence adjudicate 'anticipated difficult airway ' ( ADA ) . The ADA , attract several issue , uncommonly , converges time inefficiency , heighten equipment cost , operator anxiety , unfortunately , patient morbidity . There many cause restrict mouth opening , define technically reduce inter-incisor distance ( IID ) include trauma , TMJ movement limitation , intra/extra-oral pathology result pain , common pathology Indian subcontinent , oral submucosal fibrosis ( SMF ) . While pathology forerunner oral mitosis , associate restrict mouth opening component put conventional airway access effort anaesthesiologist spot , consequently , whole , sometimes unnecessary rigmarole activate heading 'advanced approach ADA ' . Oral submucous fibrosis ( SMF ) well-recognized , potentially malignant progressive condition afflict oral cavity characterise reduce mouth opening . The reduction mouth opening occurs due vertical reorientation collagen fibril normally haphazardly arrange . Of currently available multiple classification identify disease stage/severity , functional classification base inter-incisor distance ( IID ) seem relevant . IID form important component airway examination value less 3-cm suggestive difficulty airway management . However , despite , SMF largely unrecognized cause airway difficulty , even recognize , set protocol available ensure ( far possible ) favourable outcome term least morbidity patient , stress anaesthesiology team question . Need Assessment Study Generally , tertiary level centre , facility hand , case reduce IID normally tackle use fiberoptic bronchoscope guide tracheal intubation . However , India , burden disease lie great extent rural/suburban setting access fiberoptic bronchoscope unlikely . As result case refer 'higher ' centre management . This impose undue burden ( logistics/ financial ) onto patient family . Hence , great need anaesthesiologists work primary/secondary level healthcare set get orient problem able manage conventional option ( direct laryngoscopy &amp; intubation ) available . Scientific Contention Direct laryngoscopy remain foremost among various technique available access upper airway Macintosh blade prefer blade type . In order improve direct laryngoscopy , many modification blade design tested/ compare Macintosh blade , apparently , clarity laryngoscope blade suit give airway remain low . For majority practicing anaesthesiologists , availability different laryngoscope design increase hit-and-trial option laryngoscopy . Since time first introduce , Macintosh blade ( size 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) weather many new laryngoscope blade design stand side consistent/optimal performance . Per se , technical standpoint , although shape , various size Macintosh blade exactly similar , discrepancy becomes obvious compare sizes 1 , 2 3 &amp; 4 . Unfortunately , investigator still unclear design characteristic various size Macintosh blade impact process direct laryngoscopy . Generally , selection laryngoscope blade ( type size ) largely function individual experience preference . The absence predefined parameter selection appropriate laryngoscope blade give airway remain arbitrary . Apparently , anaesthesiologist able intubate adult trachea laryngoscope blade , however , blade type size selection assume significance presence difficult airway . The three factor influence successful direct laryngoscopy performance : ) The ability place laryngoscope blade tip vallecular recess engage hyoid bone . This require adequate length blade introduce orally reach vallecula ( transition space base tongue epiglottis ) position . ii ) The ability displace tongue aside clear view glottic-epiglottic region iii ) Achieving clear line-of-sight glottis-opening . To ensure tip laryngoscope blade engage hyoid placement vallecula , adequate blade length must insert oral cavity . Normally , easily achieve . However , face situation involve reduce mouth opening/inter-incisor distance ( e.g.as case SMF ) , length blade insert oral cavity ( functional length ) become function width blade 's flange incisor point . Thus size flange , correspond width blade must accommodate oral cavity assume particular significance patient reduce inter-incisor gap . Typically , Macintosh blade 's curved design confers different length flange 's glossal ( concave ) palatal ( convex ) surface , functional width flange increase tip towards heel [ Figure ] . Based degree mouth open restriction available IID ( cm ) , preoperative evaluation , one predict plan long Macintosh blade length require size blade would suffice place orally available IID . Hypothesis Development Marks et al , utilized x-ray base method devise method evaluate laryngoscope blade design active laryngoscopy procedure . Technically , find Macintosh size 3 4 refine blade design provide great degree forward space enhancement ( FSE , allow great mandibular space tongue move ) conventional blade ( Miller , Soper , etc. ) . This FSE-effect get magnified increase functional length blade ( length blade inside oral cavity active laryngoscopy ) . Their elaborate work address performance laryngoscope blade ( size , type ) selection theoretical setting . The information glean assessment offer valuable suggestion optimal blade position direct laryngoscopy include : ) Mandibular space 'encroachment/enhancement ' use different blade types/sizes , ii ) 'Line-of-vision ' ( view glottis ) versus 'mandibular space restriction ' ( space tongue displacement laryngoscopy ) . However , still , clinical feasibility knowledge thus gain performance assessment facilitate x-ray/fluoroscopy difficult translate routine clinical practice . As investigator prepares take conventional direct laryngoscopy process difficult airway situation primary difficulty due reduce mouth opening , need convert theoretical knowledge clinical suggestion . Investigators thus contend unless get accustom great clarity use routine equipment , analyse practical feasibility difficult situation , element randomness subjectivity continue setback .</detailed_description>
