	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia syndrome represent `` spectrum disorder '' characterize widespread chronic pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance , mood cognitive alteration . The accepted model explain cause disease focus reduce pain inhibitory system activity , allow low intensity stimulus process easier , finally amplify pain stimulus . One intervention approve Fibromyalgia Pregabalin , demonstrate effective reducing pain . Different study animal show work reduce liberation neuronal messenger , slow conduction pain signal . Although study human confirm Pregabalin clinical benefit , still study aim explain actually work patient fibromyalgia , though . A good understanding mechanism Pregabalin reduces pain patient fibromyalgia would allow design new intervention enhance clinical effect . Thus , investigator propose study real-time electrical , vascular hormonal response brain patient fibromyalgia receive single dose Pregabalin . The vascular response assess use functional near infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) neuroimaging technique . The electrical response assess use Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) . The hormonal response assess blood , measure neurotrophins ( Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ) inflammatory mediator ( Tumor Necrosis Factor ) . These response study consideration patient ' characteristic assess use validated scale . Taken account consideration , crossover , double-blinded randomized clinical trial propose . In investigator ' study , patient healthy volunteer ask visit investigator ' laboratory three opportunity : one baseline assessment , two test effect either Pregabalin 150 mg PO Placebo . All participant eventually receive , Pregabalin Placebo . In visit brain hemodynamic , electrical , hormonal clinical evaluation perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Response Single Dose Pregabalin Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A crossover , double-blinded randomized clinical trial propose . The investigator recruit literate adult female age 18 65 year old ; fulfil diagnosis criterion fibromyalgia accord American College Rheumatology 2010 ; mean pain â‰¥6 verbal analog scale ; speak Brazilian Portuguese ; able perform three visit . Female adult participant without chronic pain also recruit . Participants severe psychiatric disorder would limit consenting ; neurologic deficit ; decompensated systemic disease chronic inflammatory disorder ( Systemic Erythematous Lupus Rheumatoid arthritis ) ; contraindication TMS ; previous use Pregabalin exclude . In investigator ' study , participant ask visit investigator ' laboratory three opportunity : one baseline assessment , two test effect either Pregabalin 150 mg PO Placebo . All participant eventually receive , Pregabalin Placebo . In visit brain hemodynamic , electrical , hormonal clinical evaluation perform . In first visit , explain research , solve doubt sign informed consent , participant randomize allocation sequence ( either Pregabalin second third visit ) . Then , blood sample gather participant ask fill questionnaire understand good pain , impact quality life ( Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ) , Anxiety ( State/Trait Anxiety Inventory ) , Depressive symptom ( Beck Depression Inventory II ) , Catastrophizing thinking ( Pain Catastrophizing Scale - PCS ) , Sleep ( Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ) , resiliency . Then , fingertapping task perform assess hemodynamic change use fNIRS . After , heat perception test use quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) Conditioned Pain Modulation ( CPM ) cold . Also , pain pressure threshold ( PPT ) use digital algometer evaluate . Finally , cortical excitability parameter ( motor evoke potential , intracortical facilitation inhibition , cortical silent period ) determine use pair pulsed TMS . In second visit , accord randomize allocation participant receive either Pregabalin 150 mg PO Placebo . Then , M.I.N.I . International Neuropsychiatric Interview perform . One hour take medication , fNIRS , QST , CPM , PPT TMS evaluation repeat , new blood sample collect . In third visit , blood sample gather , follow administration correspond intervention accord randomize allocation . Then , pain level , PCS , STAI International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) ask . One hour take medication , fNIRS , QST , CPM , PPT TMS evaluation repeat , final blood sample collect . Participants ' guess blinding assess intervention . All evaluator remain blind allocation .</detailed_description>
