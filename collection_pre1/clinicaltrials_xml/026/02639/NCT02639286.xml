	<brief_summary>Background : Partial lipodystrophy deficiency body fat part body ( usually arm leg ) . People partial lipodystrophy often get high blood triglyceride ( fat ) level , insulin resistance , diabetes problem . Researchers think new drug ISIS 304801 help treat health problem cause partial lipodystrophy . Objective : To see ISIS 304801 improve blood fat ( triglyceride level ) , diabetes , liver disease , reduce risk heart disease cause partial lipodystrophy . Eligibility : Adults least 18 year old partial lipodystrophy . Design : Participants screen 1-week stay NIH . They : Blood urine test Physical exam . Assignment get either study drug placebo . Instructions inject drug . Body measurement . Heart test . Participants give injection drug placebo week home . Some may test blood sugar finger prick . They monthly phone call nurse visit take blood test . After 4 month , participant may continue study 1 year . All participant get study drug . Participants study visit NIH every 4 month . These may include : Insulin sensitivity measurement : Insulin sugar infuse 2 intravenous ( IV ) line arm . Blood drawn . Sugar fat metabolism measure IV infusion blood test . Special x-ray scan measure body fat . Liquid meal blood collect IV catheter arm . Magnetic resonance imaging scan . Neck ultrasound . Questionnaires . Liver biopsy ( optional ) Injection heparin ( blood thinner ) blood test . After finish drug , participant 1 nurse visit 1 visit NIH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Lipodystrophy rare disease deficient adipose mass , characterize severe hypertriglyceridemia well insulin resistance , diabetes mellitus , fatty liver disease , acute pancreatitis , early cardiovascular event . Apolipoprotein C-III ( apoC-III ) regulate triglyceride metabolism , apoC-III level strongly correlate serum triglyceride variety patient population . Patients genetically low level apoC-III low triglyceride reduce cardiovascular disease , individual genetically elevate level apoC-III high triglyceride increase non-alcoholic fatty liver disease insulin resistance . Pharmacologic reduction apoC-III use anti-sense oligonucleotides ( ASOs ) reduce triglyceride ~60-70 % tested patient population . Aim : The purpose study determine apoC-III reduction use ASO apoC-III ( ISIS 304801 ) reduce triglyceride improve insulin resistance , diabetes , hepatic steatosis patient lipodystrophy . The primary hypothesis test : 1 . ISIS 304801will reduce log10 fast serum triglyceride . Secondary tertiary hypothesis test : 2 . ISIS 304801will improve glucose metabolism improve insulin resistance . 3 . ISIS 304801 reduce hepatic steatosis . 4 . ISIS 304801 improve cardiovascular risk marker . We also explore mechanism action apoC-III ASO study lipoprotein lipase activity lipoprotein particle distribution . Methods : This study enroll 20 patient partial lipodystrophy goal 10 study completers . The study conduct two phase . The first 16-week , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled design . Subjects treat ISIS 304801 target dose 300 mg per week placebo . Following phase , subject enter 12 month open-label extension receive active drug . Measurement primary outcome ( serum triglyceride ) key secondary outcome perform baseline prior intervention , 13 week ( primary outcome ) 16 week ( primary secondary outcome ) blind drug placebo , additional 4 month active drug subject initially randomize placebo .</detailed_description>
