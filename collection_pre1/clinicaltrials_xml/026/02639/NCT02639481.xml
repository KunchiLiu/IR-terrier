	<brief_summary>Patients acquire brain injury ( ABI ) often suffer severe disorder consciousness ( DOC ) , coma , unresponsive wakefulness syndrome ( UWS ) , minimally conscious state ( MCS ) . This study examine effect , novel robotic rehabilitation device ( Erigo®Pro system ) recovery consciousness DOC patient . The device enable patient verticalized early acute neurorehabilitation include robotic leg movement training well functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) leg nerve . Patients randomly allocate one three treatment group : ( ) control group standard physiotherapy without device , ( ii ) device treatment without FES , ( iii ) device treatment FES . Time recovery consciousness , rehabilitation outcome , amount complication outcome variable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients acquire brain injury ( ABI ) often suffer severe disorder consciousness ( DOC ) , coma , unresponsive wakefulness syndrome ( UWS ) , minimally conscious state ( MCS ) . These DOC temporary persistent . Verticalization multisensory stimulation traditionally important therapeutic principle neurorehabilitation patient . These principle yet test randomize control trial yet . This trial therefore evaluate effect 4 week training verticalization device ( Erigo®Pro system ) integrate repetitive robotic leg movement functional electrical stimulation leg muscle ( FES ) clinical course DOC patient inpatient neurorehabilitation setting , follow acute ABI . 156 patient randomize 1:1:1 one follow group : ( ) control group without Erigo®Pro , ( ii ) treatment Erigo®Pro without FES , ( iii ) treatment Erigo®Pro simultaneous FES . There 4 training session per week 4 week session 60 minute length . This part standard neurorehabilitation program , Germany comprise 300 minute therapy per day . Patients active treatment group ii ) iii ) require verticalized 60° least 35 minute per treatment session . Patients control group treat conventional method , include verticalization therapist without help device . FES conduct follow parameter : 8 channel cover major ventral dorsal muscle upper low , initial current 10 milli ampere ( mA ) , pulse 250 micro second ( µs ) , frequency 25 herz ( Hz ) , ramp 3 . Current gradually increase motor threshold plus 20 % . The investigator test follow hypothesis : 1 . Treatment Erigo®Pro system lead quicker recovery consciousness ( increase least one diagnostic category CRS-R ) conventional therapy , 2 . Treatment Erigo®Pro system include FES lead quicker recovery consciousness use Erigo®Pro without FES , 3 ) . ) Treatment Erigo®Pro system decrease spasticity complication neurorehabilitation ( pneumonia , pressure ulcer ) conventional therapy , 4 . ) Treatment Erigo®Pro system lead improve longterm patient outcome ( 6 month ) regard independence activity daily live , compare conventional therapy . The main outcome variable Coma Recovery Scale - revise ( CRS-R ) , secondary variable Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) , Nociception Coma Scale ( NCS ) , Modified Ashworth Scale spasticity , quantitative HD-EEG measure brain activity ( power , variability , entropy ) . Study visit prior first treatment ( t0 ) , first treatment vertical position ( t1 ) , directly follow first treatment horizontal patient positioning ( t2 ) , 2 week first treatment ( halfway treatment protocol , t3 ) , end final treatment week ( t4 ) , final outcome measurement , 6 month patient inclusion ( t5 ) within patient live environment ( nursing home home ) .</detailed_description>
