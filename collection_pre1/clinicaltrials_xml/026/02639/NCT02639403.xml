	<brief_title>Palliative Short-Course Radiotherapy Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal carcinoma one cancers high incidence , although progressive decrease incidence mortality rate recently record European country . Rectal cancer may diagnose disease advanced stage , cause obstruct symptom . Colostomy represent standard treatment option patient although negatively impact quality life . Consequently , alternative treatment propose self-expandable metallic stent thermal ablative treatment ( i.e . laser argon plasma coagulation endoscopic treatment ) , , however , complication-free always feasible . Radiotherapy ( RT ) potentially effective method treatment symptom rectal carcinoma . Nevertheless , almost evidence palliative RT rectal cancer publish two decade ago base 2D conventional RT , nowadays longer use . Consequently , prospective study efficacy 3D-RT management symptomatic rectal cancer still lack . The aim prospective study ass efficacy palliative short-course 3D RT ( SCRT ) patient symptomatic obstructive rectal cancer . This trial prospective Phase II study perform Fondazione di Ricerca e Cura `` Giovanni Paolo II '' Campobasso ( Italy ) . Therapy Radiotherapy During simulation process , patient immobilize prone position up-down table , device aim reduce small-bowel irradiation . To limit organ motion , patient instruct empty bladder drink 300 cm3 water one hour CT-simulation every daily treatment fraction . After oral administration contrast medium allow bowel localization , simulation CT image take 5 mm increment region interest . Delineation clinical target volume 1 ( CTV1 ) include gross tumor volume ( GTV , primary tumor enlarge pelvic node ) correspond mesorectum plus 2 cm cranio-caudally . The planning target volume ( PTV ) CTV plus 0.8 cm margin direction . Organs risk ( OARs ) contour follow : 1 ) small intestine define intestinal loop sacral promontory ( recto-sigmoid junction exclude ) ; 2 ) femoral head contour cranial extremity level lower margin ischial tuberosity ; 3 ) bladder contour entirely distinction wall content . Conformal three-dimensional RT plan ( 3D-RT ) use Oncentra-Masterplan treatment planning system ( Nucletron B.V. , Veenendaal , Netherland ) . Short course RT ( total , 25 Gy ; 5 fraction 5 day ) deliver isocentric four-field box technique . Dose specify accord ICRU Report 62 . Dose-volume histogram ( DVHs ) calculate PTV OARs QUANTEC constraint follow . Radiotherapy deliver 10-15 MV photon energy . The beam deliver Elekta Precise Linac ( Elekta Oncology Systems , Crawley , UK ) equip standard multi leaf collimator ( MLC ) . A daily online correction protocol isocenter position apply use portal imaging , set-up correction case deviation &gt; 0.5 cm direction . All stage treatment planning process subject systematic independent check procedure , previously describe . In patient grade 3-4 toxicity , RT suspend treatment resume recovery toxicity degree â‰¤ 2 . Chemotherapy Use chemotherapy allow base refer physician preference , comorbidities age . Chemotherapy discontinue RT , one week delivery RT . Statistical Analysis Primary end-point present study rate complete response ( CR ) obstructive symptom follow radiation treatment . According Simon 's optimal design , study require enrollment 9+8 patient order detect significant rate CR obstructive symptom ( error probability limit : alpha 0.05 ; beta 0.2 ) . In case detection CR obstructive symptom first 9 enrolled patient , interruption enrollment closure study plan . In case detection least 1 CR obstructive symptom study design require recruitment least 8 additional patient final evaluation symptom response rate . To account possible non-participation rate 5 % , increased sample size second stage nine subject . Continuous variable report median range . Categorical variable report proportion percentage . The survival curve compute Kaplan-Meier method . Statistical analysis perform SPSS v. 22 ( IBM Corp. , Armonk , NY , US ) Stata 14.1 SE ( Stata corporation , College Station , TX , US )</detailed_description>
