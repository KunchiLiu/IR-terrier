	<brief_summary>Single center randomize study include 388 woman age less 39 year , perform vitro fertilization , determine blastocyst stage ( Day 5 6 ) embryo transfer ( ETs ) improve implantation pregnancy rate compare cleavage stage ( Day 2 3 ) ETs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Blastocyst Stage Compared With Cleavage Stage Embryo Transfer Women Below 39 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Embryos vitro fertilization routinely transfer woman 's uterus cleavage stage ( Day 2 3 ) blastocyst stage ( Day 5 6 ) . The rational blastocyst stage transfer blastocyst stage biologically correct stage embryos uterus , long culture laboratory may give possibility reduce number genetically abnormal embryo . The investigator design single center randomize trial , include 388 woman age less 39 year , perform vitro fertilization , confront blastocyst stage embryo transfer ( ETs ) cleavage stage ETs . Each patient randomize non blind randomization , base computer model , first day fertilization . The primary outcome implantation pregnancy rate . The secondary outcome verify blastocyst embryo transfer lead high multiple-pregnancy rate . An interim analysis take place one third population . Follow 4 week implantation rate , cover 8 week regard pregnancy rate .</detailed_description>
