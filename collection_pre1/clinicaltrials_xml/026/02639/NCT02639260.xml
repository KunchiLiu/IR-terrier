	<brief_summary>Three kidney disease affect child adult minimal change disease ( MCD ) , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) membranous nephropathy ( MN ) . These disease characterize proteinuria ( protein urine ) case FSGS membranous nephropathy , tendency progressive scarring glomerulus ( filter unit kidney ) lead end-stage kidney disease . Several therapy available disease , therapy provide last reduction proteinuria many subject . In current study , carry NIH Clinical Center , test new therapy , ManNAc . ManNAc naturally occur uncharged sugar cell use produce negatively charge sialic acid . Kidney cell attach sugar sialic acid protein lipid ( result glycans ) , assist cell function . Mouse model inherit muscle disease GNE myopathy , due sialic acid deficiency muscle glycans , respond favorably oral ManNAc therapy clinical trial ManNAc ongoing GNE myopathy subject . There evidence subject MCD , FSGS MN put enough sialic acid glomerular protein ManNAc therapy may increase sialic acid production sialylation glomerular protein subject . For present study , recruit 12 subject MCD , FSGS MN . Each subject stay NIH Clinical Center 11 day receive oral ManNAc . The primary purpose study determine : 1 ) safety ManNAc subject kidney disease ; 2 ) ManNAc sialic acid metabolism relate ManNAc subject kidney disease . Concentrations ManNAc sialic acid measure plasma various time dose . If study suggest ManNAc safe subject kidney disease , result use plan longer-term study determine whether effective reduce proteinuria .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics ManNAc Subjects With Primary Podocyte Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . ManNAc ( N-acetyl D-mannosamine ) uncharged monosaccharide biologic precursor N-acetyl neuraminic acid ( Neu5Ac , sialic acid ) . Sialic acid negatively charge , terminal monosaccharide carbohydrate chain attach glycoprotein glycolipids ( glycans ) . Most glycans serve cellular signal function , frequently appear cell surface secrete circulation . ManNAc currently development therapy rare muscular dystrophy , GNE Myopathy ( also call HIBM , hereditary inclusion body myopathy ) , cause deficiency GNE , key enzyme sialic acid synthesis ( clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT01634750 ) . A Phase 1a trial complete Phase 2 trial ManNAc GNE myopathy subject initiate effort NCATS ( TRND program ; PI : Dr. Carrillo-Carrasco ) NHGRI ( Dr. Huizing , Dr. Malicdan ; Sponsor : Dr. Gahl ) , Associate Investigators protocol . The NHGRI basic research group document podocytopathy , glomerular protein hyposialylation severe proteinuria mouse deficient GNE find podocyte ultrastructure improve , sialylation increase proteinuria decrease oral ManNAc therapy . Human kidney biopsy tissue subject various primary podocyte disease , include minimal change disease ( MCD ) , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) membranous nephropathy ( MN ) , also show glomerular hyposialylation ( manuscript preparation ) . Purpose . We propose carry Phase 1 escalate dose study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ManNAc nephrotic subject primary podocyte disease . Subjects . We propose enroll 12 subject MCD , FSGS MN . We recruit subject 6 group ( 1-3 subject ) group estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . Intervention . This dose escalation study involve two progressive ManNAc dose cohort ( N= 6 ) 3,000 mg/day 10,000 mg/day . Drug exposure occur single dose phase , involve one dose oral ManNAc follow 72 hour pharmacokinetics safety study , multiple dose phase , involve ManNAc administer two times/day 5 day . Dose escalation occur low dose assess safe subject Safety Review Committee . Outcomes . We assess safety self-reported symptom standard laboratory test . Pharmacokinetics analyze use plasma ManNAc Neu5Ac ( sialic acid ) level . The effect reduce eGFR parameter assess . While study duration short placebo control , effect ManNAc therapy proteinuria , baseline end extension phase , examine research basis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Kidney biopsy manifest MCD , FSGS ( include collapse glomerulopathy ) MN . Prior kidney biopsy requirement inclusion . Kidney biopsy material review NIH pathology ( Dr. Avi Rosenberg , another member team absence ) confirm diagnosis . With regard FSGS , histologic variant , include collapse , tip , cellular , perihilar NOS include ; primary , adaptive , genetic FSGS include ; viralassociated drugassociated FSGS exclude . The rationale include multiple primary nephrotic disease pharmacokinetics likely similar disease need effective therapy low toxicity profile . 2 . Age &gt; 18 year weigh 40 kg either sex . The rationale exclude child lack safety data patient nephrotic and/or reduce GFR evidence benefit proteinuric subject . 3 . Subjects must either take immunosuppressive therapy ( e.g. , prednisone , cyclosporine , tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil ) , alternatively , able tolerate stable dose therapy day 30 day +31 . If medically necessary , immunosuppressive therapy adjust study . Subjects renin angiotensin pathway inhibitor therapy ask discontinue current regiment include study . 4 . Weight &gt; 40 kg . Subjects 4060 kg place lowdose Cohort A . Subjects &gt; 60 kg place either Cohort A ( 3,000 mg/day ) Cohort B ( 10,000 mg/day ) . The rationale adhere maximum allowable start dose 193.5 mg DEXM74/kg body weight/day , derive preclinical animal toxicology study . 5 . Subjects first void urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 2 g/g . 6 . Subjects estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) .15 mL/min/1.73 m2 include . The rationale wish determine effect eGFR ManNAc Neu5Ac ( sialic acid ) metabolism ( include plasma PK ) . We compare 3 eGFR group : subject stage 4 CKD ( eGFR 1529 mL/min/1.73m2 ) , stage 3 CKD ( eGFR 3059 mL/min/1.73m2 ) individual stage 1 2 CKD ( eGFR .60 mL/min/1.73m2 ) . Therapy individual stage 4 CKD particularly compel unmet need , many therapy become problematic ( e.g . calcineurin inhibitor low GFR intensification reninangiotensinaldosterone system inhibitor may lower GFR raise serum potassium level ) . eGFR assess use serum creatinine ( Cr ) cystatin C ( CystC ) use CKDEPI Cr/CystC equation adult [ Inker et al , 2011 ] . 7 . Subjects must able comply requirement protocol , include blood collection , drug administration , effective communication study staff . 8 . Heterosexual couple must use least one effective form birth control , unless hysterectomy , tubal ligation , vasectomy perform . These may include follow : barrier method , oral injection ( example , Norplant DepoProvera ) contraception medication , intrauterine device . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Unwilling unable provide inform consent . 2 . Subject require use intravenous diuretic control edema , may result fluid shift intravascular space remainder extracellular fluid volume . Oral diuretic exclusionary , reserve option use intravenous diuretic study becomes necessary . 3 . Subject psychiatric illness neurological disease would interfere ability comply requirement protocol . This include , limited , uncontrolled/untreated psychotic depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , substance abuse dependence , antisocial personality disorder , panic disorder , behavioral problem , interfere effective communication . 4 Vulnerable subject , include impaired cognitive function incarcerate exclude ; 5 .

Individuals whose blood contain HBV surface antigen HCV antibody . 9 . Subject hepatic laboratory parameter ( AST , ALT , GGTP ) great 3 time upper limit normal . 10 . Subject anemic hematocrit .less equal 30 ( men woman ) . 11 . Subject show evidence clinically significant cardiovascular , pulmonary , hepatic , renal , hematological , metabolic ( include diabetes mellitus ) , gastrointestinal disease , condition require immediate surgical intervention . 12 . Subject pregnant breastfeeding time study . 13 . Subject receive treatment another investigational drug , investigational device , approve therapy investigational use le 60 day prior ManNAc dose . 14 . Subject hypersensitivity ManNAc judgment investigator , condition place subject increase risk adverse effect . 15 . Subject treat ManNAc , sialic acid , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , and/or supplement contain sialic acid ( e.g. , St. John Wort , sialyllactose ) less 60 day prior plan ManNAc dosing .</criteria>
