	<brief_title>Cortisone Injection v Trigger Point Dry Needling Fin Treatment Greater Trochanter Pain Syndrome : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim investigate potential TDN effective alternative CI patient GTPS directly compare pain functional outcome patient receive TDN CI treatment GTPS 6 week period . The investigator hypothesize patient treat TDN equally improve pain function treat CI . If TDN demonstrate equally effective steroid injection pilot study , investigator basis launch large study . Ultimately , investigator want determine TDN effective treatment alternative GTPS provider patient want avoid potential detrimental side-effects steroid . Approach : Prospective , randomize , partially-blinded design Aim : To determine administration TDN effective CI reduce lateral hip pain improve function patient diagnose great trochanteric pain syndrome . The investigator expect demonstrate effectiveness TDN treatment GTPS degree equal CI . Doing would prompt outcome research TDN . Supportive research subsequent clinical acceptance TDN primary treatment condition would offer alternative patient want need avoid steroid . Based literature , first study investigate effectiveness TDN treatment GTPS directly compare pain functional outcome patient receive TDN versus CI treatment GTPS . Methods . Fifty patient GTPS randomize CI TDN group . Treatment administer accord standard care 6 week . Numerical pain functional rating patient collect 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 week treatment . Data analysis determine TDN effective cortisone .</detailed_description>
