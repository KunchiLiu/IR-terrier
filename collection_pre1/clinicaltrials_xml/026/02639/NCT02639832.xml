	<brief_summary>The purpose research study : - To test blood presence tumor derive circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) use investigational medical device call LiquidBiopsy速 . Using LiquidBiopsy速 platform , recover cell DNA also investigate obtain genetic information may useful treat physician understanding disease . - To test blood natural killer cell ( NK cell ) , part body 's natural immune defense tumor . A device call NK VueTM Kit use test . The LiquidBiopsy速 new investigational device . An investigational device one approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The NK VueTM Kit investigational device United States approve Canada South Korea class II device . If tumor present , tiny number tumor cell content tumor cell get dislodge tumor sweep bloodstream . The LiquidBiopsy速 device able purify tiny number tumor cell ctDNA blood . Even tumor small find mean x-ray , possible ctDNA CTCs may find blood . Genetic information recover cell DNA look genetic change relate abnormal growth tumor . This potentially allow researcher study tumor cell tumor DNA blood sample instead biopsy sample . This may influence cancer diagnosis , treatment drug selection future . NK cell occur naturally body kill tumor cell . This study measure activity NK cell blood . A strong correlation low NK cell activity increase circulate tumor cell blood report .</brief_summary>
