	<brief_summary>This open label phase 2 study evaluate combination Vigil™ nivolumab advance metastatic NSCLC progressive one prior platinum-based systemic therapy . Patients meet study eligibility criterion receive Vigil™ every 2 week ( minimum 4 maximum 12 dos ) nivolumab every 2 week . The combination Vigil™ nivolumab demonstrate higher objective response rate ( ORR ) historical ORR single agent nivolumab patient advance NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open label phase 2 study evaluate combination Vigil™ autologous tumor cell immunotherapy nivolumab PD-1 inhibitor therapy patient advance metastatic NSCLC progressive one prior platinum-based systemic therapy ( ALK EGFR mutation-targeted therapy receive appropriate mutation present ) . Patients undergoing standard surgical procedure ( e.g. , tumor biopsy , palliative resection , thoracentesis malignant pleural effusion ) may elect tumor tissue procure manufacture Vigil™ vaccine . Patients meet study eligibility criterion receive doublet therapy comprising ( ) Vigil™ 1 x 10^7 cell intradermal injection every 2 week minimum 4 maximum 12 dos ( ii ) nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenous infusion 60 minute every 2 week . Three six week tissue procurement occur eligibility reconfirm study site . Subjects must begin study regimen within 6 week tissue procurement . Radiological assessment tumor response perform screening , Cycle 5 ( Week 9 ) approximately every 2 month thereafter progressive disease unless subject lose follow-up , withdraws consent study related procedure , initiate another cancer therapy . Tumor biopsy correlative study obtain tissue procurement Cycle 5 ( Week 9 ) . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) correlative study obtain tumor procurement , prior initiation study therapy Day 1 Cycle 1 ( Week 1 ) , Cycle 5 ( Week 9 ) , Cycle 9 ( Week 17 ) EOT .</detailed_description>
