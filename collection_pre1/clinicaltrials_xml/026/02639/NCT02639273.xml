	<brief_summary>Background : Drugs like nalmefene interfere opioid receptor . This might reduce drinking . The gene OPRM1 determine opioid receptor function . Researchers want see nalmefene affect people response alcohol cue . They also want compare nalmefene affect people different form OPRM1 . Objectives : To test nalmefene effect alcohol self-infusion response alcohol cue . To test role different form OPRM1 effect . Eligibility : Healthy heavy drinker age 21 60 : Women : 15 drink weekly Men : 20 drink weekly Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Heart , blood , urine test Questionnaires Participants three 10-hour visit one 2-hour follow-up visit . They take taxi . Visits 1 week apart . Before visit , participant drink alcohol 1 day take medicine 3 day . All study visit : Questionnaires Heart monitor Two-hour alcohol session : A needle guide thin plastic tube vein arm . One tube receive alcohol . The draws blood . Participants give alcohol press button computer . Relaxing center breath alcohol fall 0.02 percent , 3 hour . Visits 2 3 : Swallowing nalmefene placebo . One-hour brain MRI : Participants lie table coil head . They press button response computer cue . Follow-up visit : participant discuss drink habit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Title : Effect Opioid Receptor Modulation Alcohol Self-Administration Neural Response Alcohol Cues Heavy Drinkers : Role OPRM1 Gene Variation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study show opioid receptor modulator nalmefene reduce heavy drinking among alcoholic . Genetic variation micro-opioid receptor gene locus , OPRM1 , specifically A118G polymorphism , associate differential subjective response alcohol . Further , A118G polymorphism show moderate effect opioid receptor modulators alcohol consumption . However , role A118G nalmefene effectivenes , neural substrate underlie nalmefene therapeutic effect remain explored human . Objective : To evaluate effect nalmefene alcohol self-infusion neural response alcohol cue healthy male female heavy drinker , examine role OPRM1 A118G polymorphism effect . Study population : Participants 21-60 year-old male female heavy drinker good health , determine medical history , physical exam , ECG lab test . Participants current Axis-I mood , anxiety substance use diagnosis , except alcohol dependence , exclude . Participants divide 2 genotypic group : Group 1 ( AA ) include participant homozygous major 118A allele ( 118AA genotype ) , group 2 ( GX ) include participant carry 1 2 copy variant 118G allele ( 118AG 118GG genotype ) . Design : Participants undergo 3 study session . In first session , participant complete intravenous alcohol self-administration ( IV-ASA ) open bar phase determine baseline level alcohol consumption laboratory , well obtain data tolerability subjective measure alcohol effect . In second third session , participant receive single dose either nalmefene placebo , counter-balanced order , complete functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan IV-ASA procedure . The fMRI scan include task participant see cue indicate possibility earn alcohol reward examine neural substrate involve process alcohol cue , task design measure neural response anticipation process aversive event . The difference alcohol self-infusions two session compare two genotypic group . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure : ( 1 ) nalmefene-induced change IV alcohol self-administration ; ( 2 ) nalmefene-induced BOLD signal change neural region associate alcohol reward processing , include ventral striatum , amygdala , insula . ; Secondary outcome measure include : ( 1 ) Nalmefene-induced BOLD signal change neural process aversive stimulus fMRI ; ( 2 ) Genotypic modulation ( OPRM1 118 location ) nalmefene effect primary outcome measure ( BOLD signal change alcohol reward processing IV alcohol self-administration ) .</detailed_description>
