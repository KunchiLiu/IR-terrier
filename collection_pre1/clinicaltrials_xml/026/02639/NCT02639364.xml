	<brief_title>Airway Pressure Release Ventilation ( APRV ) Protocol Early Used Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although mechanical ventilation life-sustaining patient ARDS , perpetuate lung injury . A number recent advance greatly improved mechanical ventilation strategy treatment acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , however , Mortality remain high , even use low tidal volume adequate positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) . Numerous experimental show BILEVEL-APRV mode use animal ARDS model improve gas exchange hemodynamic tolerance ventilation reduce dosage sedative drug . The aim single-center , prospective , randomize , control , open study compare effect safety early application BILEVEL-APRV protocol conventional ventilation strategy use low tidal volume adequate PEEP level ARDS patient .</detailed_description>
