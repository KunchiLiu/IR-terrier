	<brief_summary>Background : Some people brain tumor seizure related tumor . This call tumor-related epilepsy . Usually brain tumor treat remove much brain tumor possible without cause problem . Researchers think may improve outcome people brain tumor . It may completely relieve greatly reduce number seizure . Objectives : To evaluate people brain tumor associate seizure offer surgical treatment . Also , study surgery affect seizure . Eligibility : People age 8 old brain tumor associate seizure . They must willing brain surgery treat epilepsy . Design : Participants screen review medical record . Participants medical history physical exam . Participants admit hospital NIH . They Medical history Physical exam Neurological exam Tests memory , attention , think Questions symptom quality life Blood drawn They may also : MRI CT scan . They lie table slide machine take picture . For part MRI , get dye intravenous ( IV ) catheter . Video electroencephalography monitoring . Electrodes place scalp . The participant brain wave record normal activity . Participants videotape . Participants keep seizure diary surgery . Participants surgery remove brain tumor brain area seizures start . They stay hospital week surgery . Participants follow-up visit NIH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective This protocol perform 1 ) study natural history disease pathogenesis patient tumor related epilepsy , 2 ) provide standard surgical treatment brain tumor associate seizure , 3 ) follow clinical course patient surgical resection brain tumor associate seizure , outcome seizure activity relate type tumor extent resection , 4 ) investigate neuropsychological outcome relate surgical seizure outcome , 5 ) evaluate patient report outcome symptom burden change result surgical resection patient tumor-related epilepsy , 6 ) examine change structural , available , functional image context tumor relate epilepsy surgical resection , 8 ) investigate molecular marker tumor-related seizure tumor peritumoral specimen , available , compare electrophysiological marker tumor-related seizure activity . Study Population Patients 8 year old brain tumor associate seizure may participate study . Study Design Patients screen study neurosurgeon neuro-oncologists verify confirm likely diagnosis brain tumor associate seizure . Patients confirm brain tumor associate seizure offer standard diagnostic surgical procedure . Non-invasive diagnostic procedure include structural MRI neuropsychological outcome assessment . Some patient may receive functional MRI clinically indicate , perform separate protocol , 14-N-0061 , Non-invasive pre-surgical evaluation patient focal epilepsy . Invasive procedure include surgical resection brain tumor associate epileptogenic region . The ultimate goal surgical resection safely remove tumor tissue remove modify associate epileptic focus . Prior tumor resection , diagnostic invasive monitoring intracranial electrode localization seizure focus identification eloquent cortex may clinically require . In case , invasive monitoring perform separte protocol , 11-N-0051 Epilepsy Surgery . Patients follow three month surgical procedure receive standard neurological examination MRI evaluation brain dictate care indicated brain tumor . Patients may also see one year follow surgery medically stable healthy . Participants protocol forego standard treatment brain tumor , include chemotherapy radiation treatment . Participation protocol preclude eligibility participation NINDS NCI clinical trial . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure change seizure frequency , measure Engel scale 3 month treatment . Secondary outcome measure include 1 ) mean Engel Class three month surgery stratify type brain tumor location Engel scale , seizure frequency , mean Engel Class one year surgery stratify type brain tumor location ; 2 ) extent tumor peri-tumoral resection see MRI image correlation seizure outcome ; 3 ) change neuropsychological assessment follow surgical resection stratify location type tumor extent resection ; 4 ) longitudinal change symptom burden interference score use establish instrument brain tumor patient ; 5 ) change structural image follow surgical resection ; 6 ) change use anti-epileptic medication ; 7 ) percentage patient permanent neurological side-effects surgical treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible entry study , candidate must meet following criterion : Be 8 year age old . Have solitary primary recurrent brain tumor associate seizure . Brain tumor may diagnose radiologically . Associated seizure define activity start within three month radiologic diagnosis primary recurrent tumor . In case time seizure activity unclear respect time diagnosis , seizure consider associated tumor seizure semiology consistent location . Ongoing seizure require . Patients include single previous seizure . Patients experience seizure institution anticonvulsant therapy exclude . Agree undergo brain surgery . Willing able appoint durable power attorney . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Candidates exclude : Have bleed disorder correct invasive testing surgery , medical condition would make surgery unsafe , lung cardiac disease would render unable tolerate risk general anesthesia , severe immunodeficiency systemic cancer relate brain lesion . Can MRI scan . Have multiple brain tumor , evidence carcinomatous meningitis , gliomatosis cerebri , primary CNS lymphoma . Patients multiple metastatic lesion surgery indicate exluded . Patients peripheral neurological systemic metabolic disorder cause seizure exclude . Have underlying seizure disorder unrelated brain tumor , underlie neurological disorder unrelated brain tumor may contribute seizure activity . At time enrollment , lack consent capacity due cognitive impairment would make incapable understanding explanation procedure study . Cognitive capacity consent determine time enrollment . Patients mental disorder patient cognitively impaired yet still retain consent capacity exclude . Children may enrol parent guardian able consent behalf .</criteria>
