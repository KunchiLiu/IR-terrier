	<brief_summary>This phase II , open-label , single arm , single-stage study . A total 26 evaluable patient enrol . If total number patient free disease relapse 1 year less equal 15 , drug would consider study set . After six patient treat least one dose study drug , observe minimum 60 day . During 60-day observation period , accrual halt evaluate `` unacceptable toxicity warrant early closure trial '' define : - Any definitive durvalumab-related death . A durvalumab-related death continuously monitor throughout trial trial suspend re-evaluation whenever event confirm . - Any unexpected previously unreported grade 4 toxicity definitely related durvalumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center trial . INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Subjects receive durvalumab 1500 mg IV every 4 week ( 1 cycle ) maximum 13 dos ( 12 month ) , unacceptable toxicity disease recurrence . The following baseline lab must complete within 28 day prior registration protocol therapy : Hematopoietic : - White blood cell count ( WBC ) &gt; 3 K/mm3 - Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; 9 g/dL . Transfusion allow , need , since patient post esophagectomy . - Platelets &gt; 100 K/mm3 - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3 Renal : - Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; /= 40 cc/min use Cockcroft-Gault formula 24-hour urine collection . Hepatic : - Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST , SGOT ) &lt; /= 2.5 x ULN - Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT , SGPT ) &lt; /= 2.5 x ULN</detailed_description>
