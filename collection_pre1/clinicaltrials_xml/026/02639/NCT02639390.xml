	<brief_summary>The overall goal develop robotic exoskeleton neurorehabilitation arm function stroke . The investigator previously develop novel training protocol combine ARMin HandSOME exoskeleton . This one arm exoskeleton allow coordinate whole limb training reach grasp task virtual real object . However , robot large inertia friction , gross grasp pattern available . In development work , investigator significantly modify AMRin HandSOME deliver state-of-the-art lightweight robotic exoskeleton capable retrain wide range functional activity . In subsequent test phase , clinical trial examine effect robotic training chronic stroke subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In pilot clinical trial , investigator find current robotic exoskeleton elicit improvement arm function potentially supplement conventional method improve outcome . However , robot large inertia friction , gross grasp pattern available . Therefore , improvement movement speed fine grasp limit robotic training . In development work , investigator significantly modify ARMin HandSOME deliver state-of-the-art lightweight robotic exoskeleton capable retrain wide range functional activity . The investigator reduce inertia friction robot 1/4 current value , incorporate adaptive algorithm automatically adjust assistance level extend range grasp pattern include power grasp , thumb-index finger pinch key pinch . Using improved device development activity , investigator perform clinical trial compare effectiveness robotic training conventional therapy occupational therapist . To take advantage facilitatory effect robot therapy subsequent conventional therapy , experimental treatment 12 hour robot therapy follow 12 hour conventional therapy . Chronic stroke subject ( N=38 ) randomly assign receive experimental treatment 24 hour conventional therapy occupational therapist .</detailed_description>
