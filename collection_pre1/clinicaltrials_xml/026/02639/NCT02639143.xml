	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , parallel design study investigate ticagrelor could attenuate inflammatory cell infiltration thrombus aspirate STEMI patient . The anticipated duration study approximately 9 month , include anticipated enrolment period 8 month follow-up period 1 month . Patients within 12 hour symptom onset randomly assign one-to-one ratio receive ticagrelor clopidogrel time STEMI diagnosis . The primary endpoint extent inflammatory cell infiltration thrombus aspirate STEMI patient , express number total inflammatory cell per mm2 thrombus area . Screening make select eligible participant intervention . Patients document STEMI within 12 hour symptom onset enrol study site . For patient post percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , must dual-antiplatelet therapy least 12 month eligible study . After enrollment period , patient randomly assign one-to-one ratio receive ticagrelor ( 180 mg load dose ) clopidogrel ( 600 mg load dose ) time STEMI diagnosis . In addition randomize study medication patient receive concomitant Ace Salicylic Acid ( ASA ) 100 mg daily treatment period accord local practice , unless allergic intolerant . For previously give aspirin , load dose 300 mg prefer . At end study , data collect analyzed .</detailed_description>
