	<detailed_description>Subjects agree participate study sign inform consent form prior initiation research related procedure . Subjects consent study coordinator , physician , one physician ' staff strong knowledge purpose design clinical trial . There two phase study : one phase take place clinic , take place subject home . Each subject participate phase . The home phase two arm : one subject phase 2 1 week , one phase 2 4 week . It initially anticipate 1 week arm enrol first . As result phase 1 come patient physician get idea ease use system , phase 2 enrol . Consented patient prescribe eye drop medication regimen consist 1-5 different eye drop medication daily ask participate study . Consent technician assessment do subject 's normal clinician designate clinical technician/trial coordinator , certify human clinical trial Lee Memorial Health System . The first phase take place control clinic environment , assess ability device read center accurately determine number volume drop get eye time instill well log easy use directory . Five hundred patient , designate caregiver unable apply drop , equip EDAM , train use device , ask dispense 10 drop saline eye clinic observe trained ophthalmic technician . During application procedure , patient designate caregiver , observe clinical technician ask write many drop dispense drop land eye , outside eye , half half . All EDAM device return read center Retina Health Center follow use end day , along subject technician questionnaire assessment . All data remove cleared device reading center store secure server . EDAMs return clinic come use subject . Accuracy write log ( patients/caregivers technician ) compare log create technician reading center view application procedure slow motion read-outs drop assessment software . For second phase trial , 500 patient ( designated caregiver ) ask use EDAM home drop application 7 28 consecutive day ( 50 group ) . Patients assign initially one week group short term evaluation device confirm ease use , safety . Once patient complete 1 week use without complication , physician may assign patient either four week group one week group ( one week group , do study ) discretion . At end week , subject designate caregiver ask return EDAM clinic provide device read center base Retina Health Center . As clinical arm , data remove cleared EDAM device read center store secure server assessment . EDAMs return clinic come use subject . At time , subject and/or designate caregiver also ask complete another study questionnaire take 5-10 minute ( see append questionnaire ) . Since pilot exploratory study , desirable allow flexibility try identify issue may develop group prior undertake longer large study . Patients ask use drop routinely . The goal see EDAM easy use , capture desire data , get idea patient compliance random group patient . As mention , end week , patient ( designate caregiver applicable ) return clinic technician download accumulate videos create log document drop procedure note whether drop make fully eye , half , , unable make accurate assessment even video record . This log view physician . The designated care giver may change eye drop application procedure , care giver assist eye drop procedure must return subject complete study questionnaire .</detailed_description>
