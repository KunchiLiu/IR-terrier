	<brief_summary>The propose trial `` Randomized , Double Blind , Placebo Controlled `` first in-human '' Study Assess Safety Tolerability Single Ascending Oral Doses PBF-677 Male Healthy Volunteers '' ( Protocol Code No : CUNFI-1509 EudraCT No:2015-003546-57 ) single-centre , randomize , double-blind , dose escalation study without therapeutic benefit , PBF-677 administer single , oral , ascending-dose volunteer . Up four different rise dos ( 100 mg , 200 mg , 400 mg 600 mg ) test group 8 participant ; dose level participant randomize active drug placebo 6:2 fashion . As first time PBF-677 go administered human , safety measure stepwise drug administration perform cohort . The volunteer cohort divide 3 blocks/subgroups : Initially , one volunteer receive active drug ( subgroup 1 ) . After 48h safety tolerability assessment , second subgroup 3 volunteer receive 2 active drug 1 placebo 48h safety tolerability assessment third subgroup 4 volunteer receive 3 active drug 1 placebo . After evaluation safety , parameter correspond dose level process replicate one week afterwards follow dosage . The principal variable safety tolerability PBF-677 evaluate physical record ( Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , vital sign , blood chemistry haematology , conduct , study course ) . Assessment pharmacokinetic profile ( Maximum plasma concentration drug ( peak ) single dose ( Cmax ) , Time necessary reach Cmax ( tmax ) , Area time-concentration curve `` zero '' time `` '' ( AUC0t ) , Elimination half-life ( t1/2 ) PBF-677 include secondary variable .</brief_summary>
