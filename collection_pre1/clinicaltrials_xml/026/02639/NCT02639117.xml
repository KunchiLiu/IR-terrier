	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 single site study evaluate safety efficacy combination therapy include administration vismodegib photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) use aminolevulinic acid ( 20 percent ALA ) multiple basal cell carcinoma . All subject receive vismodegib 150mg mouth every day 3 month , undergo three PDT session topical application ALA . The PDT first administer 7+ 4 business day begin Erivedge 45 + 5 business day 90 + 10 business day . Primary Objective The primary objective study determine safety photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) vismodegib ( combination therapy ) patient multiple BCC . 3.2 Secondary Objective To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) combination therapy patient multiple BCCs.ORR define proportion evaluable study subject complete partial response study treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Use PDT treatment BCC Indications PDT include superficial nodular BCC . Eight randomize clinical trial report result PDT superficial nodular BCC total 1583 patient . Results meta analysis show overall complete clearance PDT 86.4 % compare 98.2 % surgery . The 1 year recurrence PDT 10.3 % v 0 . 6 % surgery . Cosmetic outcomes much good PDT surgery . ( Wang , 2015 ) . A randomized control trial PDT MAL versus surgical excision 196 patient superficial BCC show 9.3 % recurrence rate PDT versus 0 % recurrence rate surgery 12 month . However , good-to-excellent cosmetic outcome 94 % 60 % patient treat PDT surgical excision , respectively . Similarly , trial PDT versus surgery nodular BCC , recurrence rate less 5 % surgery versus 14 % 30 % PDT ALA. As superficial BCC , cosmetic effect consistently show favorable PDT ALA ( Wang , 2015 ) . In large single institution experience 1440 nodular superficial BCCs , PDT use systemically administer porfimer sodium show initial ( 6-month ) complete response rate 92 % , recurrence rate le 10 % 4 year . At institution , 92 % complete response rate achieve PDT topical ALA 330 patient superficial BCC , response rate drop 71 % 75 patient nodular BCC . In multicenter randomize trial PDT MAL versus cryotherapy superficial BCC , complete response rate 3 month 97 % 95 % , respectively , 5-year recurrence rate 22 % 20 % PDT MAL cryotherapy , respectively . In study , excellent-to-good cosmetic outcome 89 % PDT MAL 50 % cryotherapy . Several clinical study report increase initial response rate low recurrence rate repeat PDT session . Initial response usually apparent 3-6 month treatment skin heal treatment relate change resolve . Cycles MAL PDT repeat 3 month persistent BCC show offer high durable response rate . Both efficacy safety also demonstrate use repeated session red blue light follow time 3 , 6 12 month . At Roswell Park Cancer Institute , Oseroff colleague safely use repeated session ALA PDT child BCNS ( multiple BCC ) , Gilchrest also report benefit ALA PDT red light 2-4 month interval treatment . The common adverse event either ALA MAL PDT burn sting pain experience patient illumination . Zeitouni colleague publish retrospective prospective data use 2 step irradiance approach ALA/MAL PDT red light non BCNS patient multiple BCC . Follow time range 6-24 month . The 2 step irradiance schedule ( bilevel ) effectively minimize treatment relate pain maintain good clinical outcome ( Zeitouni x 2 ) .</detailed_description>
