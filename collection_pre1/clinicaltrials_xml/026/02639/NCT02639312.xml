	<brief_summary>Background : Some head facial abnormality rare present birth . Others common , may show puberty . These condition different cause characteristic . Researchers want learn condition compare people face , head , neck abnormality family member healthy volunteer without condition . Objectives : To learn abnormal development face , head , neck . To determine genetic variant . Eligibility : People surgery facial trauma : People age 2 old craniofacial abnormality ( may participate offsite ) Unaffected relative age 2 old Healthy volunteer age 6 old Design : Participants screen medical history physical exam focus head , face , neck Participants may follow several year . Visits may require stay near clinic day . A visit require following developmental stage , along follow-up visit : Age 2 6 Age 6 10 Age 11 17 Age 18 old Visits may include : Medical history Physical exam Questionnaires Oral exam Blood urine test Cheek swab : cotton swab wipe across inside cheek several time . Cone beam CT scan ( CBCT ) : x-rays create image head , face , teeth , neck . Participants stand still sit chair 20 minute scanner rotate around head . Photos head face Offsite participant provide : Copies medical dental record Leftover tissue sample previous surgery Blood sample cheek swab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Craniofacial Anomalies Developmental Growth Variants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This natural history study examine craniofacial anomaly affect normal development facial skeleton , include birth defect dentofacial developmental abnormality express growth individual . Craniofacial anomaly may rare present birth , hemifacial microsomia ( 1 every 7500 live birth ) , common , dentofacial deformity include Habsburg Jaw mandibular prognathism ( 1 % US population ) become apparent child enters puberty . These strike disorder involve face surround structure , focal point self-identity intimately tie quality life daily function . The primary objective study : 1 . To characterize rare common craniofacial anomaly use extensive clinical evaluation , 3D cone-beam compute tomography-based geometric morphometric cephalometric analysis , surface morphology 2 . To determine genetic variant rare common craniofacial anomaly . The secondary objective establish curated craniofacial phenomic/genomic database . The study population include individual age great equal 2 year craniofacial anomaly focus two specific condition affect facial skeletal development : hemifacial microsomia mandibular prognathism child adult . Up 1920 subject family member well 480 healthy volunteer recruit referral NIH outside provider institution . This natural history protocol generate research data improve understand etiology craniofacial dysmorphologies .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : For Subjects : Age great equal 2 craniofacial anomalies/abnormalities . Affected family member ( define individual demonstrable relationship ( family relationship matter distant ) subject pedigree ) express craniofacial anomaly classify subject . Able provide consent case , minor , legallyauthorized representative provide consent . For Unaffected Family Members : These family member define individual demonstrable relationship ( family relationship matter distant ) proband subject pedigree express craniofacial anomaly . Greater equal 2 year old . Able provide consent case , minor , legallyauthorized representative provide consent . For Healthy Volunteers : In good general health . Greater equal 6 year old . Able provide consent case , minor , legallyauthorized representative provide consent . Absence craniofacial congenital anomaly malocclusion . No family history craniofacial syndrome . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For All Participants : A history facial trauma require surgical treatment facial reconstruction . Refusal genetic test CBCT imaging . Participants must agree least one two ( require participate ) . For Healthy Volunteers : Female volunteer pregnant nursing .</criteria>
