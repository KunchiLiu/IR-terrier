	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm metastatic melanoma , metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer , metastatic breast cancer , metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma relapse refractory therapy outline patient malignancy decline , become unable tolerate ( e.g . progressive chemotherapyassociated peripheral neuropathy ) , eligible standard therapy : Metastatic melanoma patient line therapy , Metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer patient relapse refractory least one line systemic anticancer therapy metastatic disease , include cytotoxic chemotherapy target therapy , Metastatic breast cancer patient relapse refractory least one line systemic anticancer therapy metastatic disease , cytotoxic chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , target therapy , Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma relapse refractory least one line systemic anticancer therapy metastatic disease , cytotoxic chemotherapy target therapy At least two measurable lesion ( include index lesion ) accord RECIST guideline v1.1 An index lesion measure 1cm 7cm amenable hypofractionated radiation therapy discretion treat radiation oncologist Index lesion pancreas exclude second cohort Age great equal 18 year Signed , write informed consent Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 Adequate hematological function document within 3 week prior initial treatment base : White blood cell ≥ 2,500 cells/ul without growth factor support , Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500 cells/ul without growth factor support , Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL , Platelet count ≥ 100,000 platelets/ul , Adequate hepatic renal function document within 3 week prior initial treatment base : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . For subject liver metastasis , ALT AST ≤ 5 x ULN , Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN except patient document Gilbert 's syndrome liver metastasis , must baseline total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dl , Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Full recovery acute effect prior cancer treatment , define effect resolve NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade 0 1 exception alopecia certain laboratory value list . Subjects irreversible toxicity reasonably expect exacerbated MEDI4736 tremelimumab may include ( eg , hear loss , neuropathy ) upon approval PI . For patient central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases , metastasis must asymptomatic time Day 1 study meet follow criterion : At least 28 day without progression CNS metastases evidence magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) last day treatment radiation CNS metastases At least 14 day since last dose corticosteroid Must leptomeningeal disease cord compression Females childbearing potential sexually active nonsterilized male partner must use highly effective method contraception time screening , must agree continue use precaution 180 day final dose MEDI4736 tremelimumab . Cessation contraception point discuss responsible physician . Periodic abstinence , rhythm method , withdrawal method acceptable method contraception . They must also refrain egg cell donation 180 day final dose MEDI4736 tremelimumab : Females childbearing potential define surgically sterile ( ie , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , complete hysterectomy ) postmenopausal ( defined 12 month menses postmenopausal gonadotropin level , luteinizing hormone [ LH ] folliclestimulating [ FSH ] , postmenopausal estradiol level within postmenopausal range accord local guideline without alternative medical cause ) , A highly effective method contraception define one result low failure rate ( i.e. , less 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly . The acceptable method contraception include barrier method ( male condom plus spermicide , Copper T intrauterine device , Levonorgesterelreleasing intrauterine system ) hormonal method ( implant , hormone shot injection , combine pill , minipill , patch ) , Nonsterilized males sexually active female partner childbearing potential must use highly effective method contraception ( outline ) Day 1 90 day receipt final dose MEDI4736 tremelimumab . In addition , must refrain sperm donation 90 day final dose investigational product . Concurrent enrollment another clinical study , unless followup period study observational noninterventional study Prior treatment antiCTLA4 , antiPD1 , antiPDL1 ( approve investigational agent ) Concurrent treatment anticancer agent , include chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy . In breast cancer patient , concurrent use hormonal therapy ( trastuzumab ) acceptable provide hormonal therapy initiate 30 day prior treatment study . Treatment investigational agent within 3 week prior first dose MEDI4736 tremelimumab Major surgical procedure ( defined investigator ) within 28 day prior first dose MEDI4736 tremelimumab still recover prior surgery Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 14 day first dose MEDI4736 tremelimumab exception intranasal inhaled corticosteroid , systemic corticosteroid physiologic dos exceed 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent , steroid use transiently control contrast agent allergy radiographic study . Active prior document autoimmune disease ( include inflammatory bowel disease , diverticulitis exception diverticulosis , celiac disease , irritable bowel disease , Wegner syndrome , Hashimoto syndrome ) within past 3 year . Subjects vitiligo , alopecia , Grave 's disease , psoriasis require systemic treatment ( within past 3 year ) exclude . Patients hypothyroidism stable thyroid replacement therapy previous 3 month exclude .

HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g . HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect . Receipt live , attenuated vaccine within 28 day prior first dose MEDI4736 tremelimumab ( NOTE : subject , enrol , receive live vaccine study 180 day last dose drug ) Clinical contraindication stereotactic body radiotherapy determine investigator ( e.g. , active systemic sclerosis , active inflammatory bowel disease bowel within radiation field . ) Prior radiotherapy precludes propose treatment hypofractionated radiotherapy Females pregnant , lactating , intend become pregnant participation study Uncontrolled intercurrent illness , include , limited , ongoing active infection , current pneumonitis , symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , interstitial lung disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement compromise ability subject give write informed consent Other active invasive malignancy .
