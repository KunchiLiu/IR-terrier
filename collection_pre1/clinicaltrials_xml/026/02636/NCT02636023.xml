	<brief_summary>The study Sponsor , Heart Force Medical Inc. ( HFM ) , develop patent medical device call SPhENo-CardiographTM . The SPhENo-Cardiograph™ provide non-invasive assessment electro-mechanical function heart . The electrocardiograph ( ECG ) represent waveform electrical stimulus cardiac muscle . The mechanical action electrical potential deliver ECG reveal seismocardiograph ( SCG ) . The SCG represent change acceleration heart cardiac cycle . The SCG waveform reflect ultra-low frequency vibration cardiac contraction . These low frequency vibration transmit sternum . Using point initiation ventricular contraction ECG , Q wave , fiduciary point synchronous seismocardiograph , possible determine time event cardiac cycle . The timing event cardiac cycle systole refer Systolic Timing Intervals ( STI ) comprise Pre-Ejection Period ( PEP ) Left Ventricular Ejection Time ( LVET ) . The PEP time Q wave Aortic valve opening . The Left Ventricular Eject Time ( LVET ) time Aortic Valve opening closing . The ratio PEP/LVET individual establish heart disease &gt; 0.42 . It base formula describe Dr Arnold Weissler first publish Circulation 1968 ( Weissler et al,1968 ) . Weissler et al show PEP/LVET ratio &gt; 0.42 indicative lengthen PEP marginal shortening LVET . This indicative pathology associate coronary circulation ( Ahmed et al , 1972 ; ) . This ratio use part non-invasive quantitative assessment cardiac performance ( Lewis et al 1977 ) . Using SPhENo-CardiographTM , HFM develop algorithm assess heart health otherwise require number technology ; stethoscope , ECG Carotid pulse trace identify dicrotic notch Aortic Valve closure .</brief_summary>
