	<detailed_description>Group 1 ( FMT group ) undergo follow procedure Pre-FMT preparation : We obtain write informed consent per IRB guideline . After patient consent eligible , perform detailed medical history physical exam day 0 . We also perform cognitive testing . As prior study , prescribe patient antibiotic regimen . Drawing ecological principle microbial niche environment data recurrent Clostridium difficile infection , pre-treatment antibiotic likely increase probability disrupt host intrinsic microbiota create opportunity 'healthy ' microbiota FMT engraft . After antibiotic day FMT : At day 5 , re-evaluate patient direct interval history focus physical exam need . After ensure still candidate accord inclusion/exclusion criterion , collect stool , urine blood pre-FMT evaluation urine pregnancy test eligible woman . Cognitive testing perform . Preparation handle stool FMT infusion Standard protocol handle bio-hazardous material employ order avoid contamination risk healthcare handler . Sterile microbiological technique employ material transfer peri-procedure . At point provide fecal material use universal precaution standard retention enema bag . The procedure complete trained Registered Nurse , Nurse practitioner , physician outpatient clinic , endoscopy recovery area , standard endoscopy unit . The follow record FMTs - Dose - Unit ID/Lot # treatment - Expiration Date - Storage Condition - FMT retention time ( minute ) Number FMT : One administration Duration Follow-up FMT : 5 month Follow-up FMT : We see patient clinic day follow FMT ( day 6 FMT+1 ) , day 12 ( FMT+7 ) , day 20 ( FMT+15 ) , day 35 ( FMT+30 ) , point detailed history regard abdominal symptom , evaluation infectious complication , hospitalization complication cirrhosis . Visits day 6 , day 12 day 35 purely safety associate , day 20 visit , repeat pathophysiological study . In order ensure enough sample , case patient able return day 20 , also collect sample day 12 , analyze case day 20 visit occur . These visit , apart visit FMT , Â±2 day patient convenience . At 5 month post-FMT , subject follow phone call evaluate potential SAEs , new onset transmit infection , new onset significant worsen chronic medical condition suspect unexpected serious adverse reaction occur 35 day 5 month report purpose . Samples collect baseline ( FMT ) , antibiotic day 15 : 1 . Stool 2 . Blood 3 . Urine Group 2 : No treatment arm The group 2 undergo sample collection , follow-up cognitive test group 1 without 5-day antibiotic therapy FMT . In addition , also perform sample collection do 5 day antibiotic group since reasonable change microbiota expect 5 day without antibiotic . The follow-up group FMT group .</detailed_description>
