	<brief_title>Use Entresto Sacubitril/Valsartan Treatment Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current approach treatment peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) lack success observe treatment form vascular disease . A potential reason may available treatment target pathological mechanism implicate development PAD . These mechanism include obstruction aortic-iliac artery branch due formation atherosclerotic plaque mitochondrial microvascular dysfunction . Although blood flow improve follow surgical revascularization , pain free maximal walk duration improve degree . This suggest addition blood flow obstruction , mitochondrial microvascular dysfunction significant factor implicate development PAD . Therefore , treatment design patient PAD aim improve mitochondrial microvascular function . In regard , natriuretic peptide ( NP ) show increase mitochondrial microvascular density two finding associate increase oxygen consumption perfusion skeletal muscle . The Investigator propose increase endogenous natriuretic peptide inhibit enzyme degrades blood increase mitochondrial microvascular function associate increase maximal pain free walking duration . To test hypothesis investigator design double blind randomize controlled clinical trial provide sacubitril/valsartan 12 week trial period.The improvement mitochondrial microvascular function measure use magnetic resonance ( MR ) spectroscopy functional MR imaging exercise stress test use ass maximal pain free walking duration . This trial provide patient PAD non-surgical , cause-specific treatment option .</detailed_description>
