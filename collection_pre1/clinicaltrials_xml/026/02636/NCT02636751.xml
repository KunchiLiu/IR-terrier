	<brief_title>Effects Tele- In-person Prehabilitation Candidates Awaiting Total Hip Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common disorder affect almost every Canadian 65 year age . Future estimation indicate incidence OA increase least 26 % next 30 year Canada . Hip knee affect joint OA condition incur important disability . Lower limb OA initially treat conservatively therapeutic intervention physical activity modification , exercise , weight control , medication . Surgical intervention total joint arthroplasty ( TJA ) proven treatment choice severe case . However , accessibility surgery often come long wait list , prolong wait time may lead deleterious effect health status quality life await patient . Prehabilitation refers education exercise surgery . Attention prehabilitation increase last decade grow body evidence suggest could positive effect postoperative outcome may reduce disability surgery number condition . In context prehabilitation TJA , trial already show rehabilitation exercise program TJA could lead short hospitalisation length stay , addition increase muscle strength range motion follow total hip knee arthroplasty . However , result concern longer-term effect prehabilitation TJA tend inconsistent research actually need well understand effect prehabilitation post-surgical course . As age population constant increase chronic diseases keep pressure healthcare system worldwide , lack resource tend lengthen wait time surgery like TJA . Long wait time medical intervention negative impact pain , function quality life . Policymakers therefore search care optimisation strategy improve healthcare accessibility prehabilitation . Among solution stand use technology help deliver efficiently rehabilitation service improve access type care . Telerehabilitation gain increased recognition define provision rehabilitation service distance , use information communication technology . Previous study already show telerehabilitation program feasible home-care setting . Tousignant et al . demonstrated telerehabilitation program efficient less expensive conventional physiotherapy total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Bedra et al . qualify viable home-based telerehabilitation program hip fracture , Anton et al . demonstrate Kinect™-based system adjuvant physiotherapy total hip replacement . Those program present good opportunity optimise delivery care community rehabilitation , especially increase number patient see single day , reduce medical cost travel time , provide access medical care otherwise unavailable rural area . However , study , knowledge , analyse outcome telerehabilitation proceed total joint replacement . This pilot single blind randomize control trial aim therefore evaluate feasibility impact pain disability telerehabilitation prehabilitation program patient await total joint ( hip knee ) arthroplasty compare in-person prehabilitation usual care . Our hypothesis 12-week prehabilitation program significantly increase functional mobility quality life subject experimental group , control group . EXAMINATION PROCEDURE AND RANDOMIZATION During baseline evaluation Maisonneuve-Rosemont Research Center , eligible participant complete questionnaire cover sociodemographic status , comorbidities , medication usage . Patients ask fill four French validate self-reported questionnaire : Lower Extremity Functional Scale ( LEFS-CF ) , Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC-CF ) , Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36-CF ) Global Rating Change Scale ( GRC-CF ) . Three physical functional performance measure also collect : self-paced walk ( SPW ) , time up-and-go ( TUG ) time stair test ( ST ) . These test orient toward activity daily live validate geriatric population . They reliable , reproducible , responsive change . They also widely use measure outcomes patient undergo TJA . An online version questionnaire use Survey Monkey® platform paper version provide participant . Finally , logbook give participant . They ask record exercise execute home , include number series repetition , addition medication intake . This logbook allow monitor compliance rate program also advent adverse effect . Patients randomly assign control group one two experimental group . An independent research assistant , blind baseline evaluation result , open randomization envelope indicate participant 's assignment group . A random number generator use establish randomization list prior initiation study . A member research team , involve data collection , generate randomization list . Blocked randomization 6 use make sure three equal group 12 subject participant obtain . Participants reassess 12 week blind research assistant , completion intervention . The evaluation tool baseline use , accord standardized procedure . A satisfaction questionnaire telecommunication software experience fill participant therapist use telecommunication software .</detailed_description>
