	<brief_summary>This screening study intend men woman least 18 year age advance solid hematologic malignancy . The study ass subject 's human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) subtype tumor antigen expression profile . Based result , determine subject eligible consider Adaptimmune sponsor clinical trial test safety efficacy genetically change T cell target specific tumor antigen . No treatment intervention occur part screen study . Upon enrollment , subject require provide blood sample HLA subtype analysis . If result analysis match HLA-A subtypes note inclusion criterion express HLA subtypes exclusionary available interventional clinical trial ( ) , subject require provide either archival tumor specimen fresh tumor tissue biopsy . The tumor specimen screen central laboratory expression ( protein gene ) multiple antigen may include , limited NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a MAGE A10 . Based upon result diagnostic analysis , eligible , subject refer appropriate available interventional clinical trial ( ) discretion Investigator . Following screening , tumor sample retain Adaptimmune purpose develop validate vitro diagnostic ( IVD ) assay ( ) antigen expression profiling require regulatory approval new therapeutic product indication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter screen study conduct order determine subject 's tumor antigen expression profile HLA subtype , subsequent eligibility Adaptimmune sponsor clinical treatment trial study safety efficacy autologous genetically modify T-cells engineer enhanced TCRs target specific antigen . No treatment intervention occur part screen study . Specific Adaptimmune sponsor interventional protocol designate utilize screening protocol determine preliminary eligibility . Therefore , detail available interventional clinical trial ( ) ( e.g. , HLA subtype , tumor antigen , eligibility criterion ) understand consent subject screen protocol . For screen study , subject confirm advanced solid hematologic malignancy recurrent disease , describe respective Adaptimmune clinical trial protocol ( ) , require provide blood sample diagnostic analysis . The blood sample use HLA subtype analysis . If result analysis match HLA subtype specify available interventional clinical trial ( ) , subject require provide either archival tumor specimen fresh tumor tissue biopsy . The tumor specimen screen central laboratory expression ( gene protein ) multiple antigen use Clinical Trial Assays . The Clinical Trial Assays use protocol undergone CLIA validation establish sensitivity , specificity performance assay . The antigen screen may include , limited following : NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a MAGE-A10 . Based upon tumor antigen expression HLA subtype , eligible , subject refer appropriate available interventional trial ( ) discretion Investigator . The secondary objective study collection analysis tumor tissue specimens enable development validation single and/or multiple-marker ( 'multiplex ' ) IVD assay ( ) antigen expression profiling . It regulatory requirement develop IVD ( ) companion diagnostic ( ) accompany future new indication drug application ( ) . Therefore tumor specimen study retain Adaptimmune companion diagnostic validation purpose .</detailed_description>
