	<brief_title>Exercise Intolerance Elderly Patients With HFpEF ( Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HFPEF ) common form HF , nearly unique old population , particularly old woman , increase prevalence . Exercise intolerance , severe exertional dyspnea fatigue , primary manifestation chronic HFPEF major determinant patient ' severely reduce quality life ( QOL ) . However , pathophysiology poorly understood optimal treatment remain undefined . Our recent data others ' indicate older HFPEF patient , increased adiposity abnormality skeletal muscle major contributor exercise intolerance potential therapeutic target . Obesity one strong risk factor HFPEF , robust predictor physical disability old person . The investigator recently report HFPEF compare age-matched control , percent total leg lean mass significantly reduce independently predict exercise capacity . Using MRI needle biopsy thigh muscle , investigator find increase fat infiltration , reduce capillary density percent type I oxidative fiber , trend reduce muscle mitochondrial mass function . Reduced exercise capacity relate muscle abnormality , support important role HFPEF . Diet , without aerobic exercise , increase exercise capacity quality life old obese person variety disorder , usually result significant loss skeletal muscle mass , could potentially adverse long term consequence . The purpose trial determine addition resistance training diet plus aerobic exercise training improve skeletal muscle mass function HFPEF . Multiple line evidence preliminary data indicate resistance training ( RT ) may ideal addition CR+AT HFPEF , since RT reliably increase muscle mass , quality , strength , function , significantly AT , prevent nearly 50 % muscle mass loss CR . Therefore , primary aim propose study conduct randomize , single-blinded 20-week intervention trial RT add CR+AT 84 overweight / obese ( BMI great 28 kg/m2 ) , old ( age great 60 year ) HFPEF patient test follow primary hypothesis : The addition resistance training CR+AT improve exercise capacity .</detailed_description>
