	<brief_title>A Comparative Study Two Endoscopic Operations Lacrimal Duct Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lacrimal duct obstruction common among patient epiphora , seriously affect quality life . The treatment principle restore rebuild lacrimal duct drainage channel . The classic operation type dacryocystorhinostomy ( DCR ) , complex face-section particularly . However , development endoscopy , investigator prefer silicone nasolacrimal intubation nasal endoscopy , simple efficient . With endoscopy , investigator see anatomical structure clearly perform operation much perfectly.Compare classic one call DCR , short long term therapeutic effect equal even better.Therefore , latter type good doctor patient .</detailed_description>
