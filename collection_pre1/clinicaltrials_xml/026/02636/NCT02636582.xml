	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine therapy sargramostim work treat patient breast cancer . Vaccines make peptide antigen and/or person 's white blood cell mixed tumor protein may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell express breast cancer . It yet know whether nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine sargramostim effective treating patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nelipepimut-S Plus GM-CSF Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate nelipepimut-S-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ; cluster differentiation [ CD ] 8+ T cell ) response vaccinate patient compare patient receive GM-CSF ( sargramostim ) alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Toxicity profile frequency adverse event woman ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) breast receive nelipepimut-S vaccine ( nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine ) compare woman receive GM-CSF alone . II . In vivo immune response nelipepimut-S determine delayed type hypersensitivity reaction ; III . Immune response tumor antigen ( epitope spread ) . IV . Functional capacity immune response vaccination . V. Determine CTL functional capability use intracellular cytokine assay . VI . Evaluate polyfunctional cytokine response assess multiplex assay . VII . Presence DCIS resection . VIII . Difference human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) expression biopsy surgical specimen excise post-vaccination . IX . Histologic response : degree lymphocyte infiltration determine hematoxylin eosin ( H &amp; E ) stain slide immunohistochemistry stain CD3 , CD4 CD8 . X. Histologic response : proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen ( Ki67 ) DCIS cell ( proliferation ) . XI . Histologic response : cleave caspase 3 DCIS cell ( apoptosis ) . XII . Immune infiltrate normal tissue maximally distant tumor ( mastectomy sample ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine intradermally ( ID ) 3 vaccination 2 week apart prior surgery . ARM II : Patients receive sargramostim ID 3 vaccination 2 week apart prior surgery , 3 vaccination 1 month apart post-surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 3 month .</detailed_description>
