	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) MM Patients With Residual Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) B cell malignancy characterize presence bone marrow infiltration clonal plasma cell generally secrete monoclonal component serum urine . It second frequent hematological malignancy , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , account approximately 10 % hematological tumor 1 % cancer . Treatment MM remain substantially unchanged time ( review alkylating agent melphalan combination steroid gold standard 25 year . Later , 1970 decade , drug carmustine vincristine combine melphalan , cyclophosphamide steroid give rise chemotherapeutic regimen ; ten year later high dos melphalan autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) introduce clinical practice . All treatment schemes result overall survival around 30 month 1994 slight improvement subsequent five year , probably due introduction ASCT good measure supportive care . Finally , first decade century , new drug novel mechanism action clear antimyeloma activity discover approve . In regard , several study demonstrate activity proteasome inhibitor bortezomib immunomodulatory agent thalidomide lenalidomide relapsed/refractory MM patient . The emergence drug result clear improvement outcome patient last year , increase median overall survival five year . Nevertheless , despite clear progress , patient ( ) eventually relapse outcome MM patient become refractory ineligible receive bortezomib IMID quite poor survival inferior one year.Therefore novel therapeutic option still necessary relapse refractory patient . In regard , several drug target specific mechanisms tumoral cell currently explore preclinical clinical setting . ( 10 ) Some example promise targeted agent second-generation proteasome inhibitor immunomodulatory agent , deacetylase inhibitor ( DACi ) , kinesin spindle protein inhibitor filanesib several monoclonal antibody . Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) Programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) axis function mechanism action MK-3475 The programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) receptor-ligand interaction major pathway hijack tumor suppress immune control . The normal function PD-1 , express cell surface activate T cell healthy condition , down-modulate unwanted excessive immune response , include autoimmune reaction . PD-1 family member type I transmembrane glycoprotein contain Ig Variable-type ( V-type ) domain responsible ligand bind cytoplasmic tail responsible bind signal molecule . The cytoplasmic tail PD-1 contain two tyrosine-based signal motif , immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif ( ITIM ) immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif ( ITSM ) . Following T-cell stimulation , PD-1 recruit tyrosine phosphatase , SHP-1 SHP-2 , ITSM motif within cytoplasmic tail , lead dephosphorylation effector molecule CD3ζ , PKCθ , ZAP70 , involve CD3 T-cell signal cascade . PD-1 ( encode gene Pdcd1 ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) superfamily member related CD28 CTLA-4 show negatively regulate antigen receptor signal upon engagement ligand ( PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 ) .The mechanism PD-1 modulate T-cell response similar , distinct , CTLA-4 , molecules regulate overlap set signal protein . PD-1 show express activated lymphocyte include peripheral CD4+ CD8+ T cell , B cell , T regs , natural killer cell . Expression also show thymic development CD4-CD8- ( double negative ) T cell , well subset macrophages dendritic cell . ( 20 ) The ligands PD-1 ( PD-L1 PD-L2 ) constitutively express induced variety cell type include non-hematopoietic tissue various tumor . Both ligands type 1 transmembrane receptor contain IgV- IgC-like domain extracelular region contain short cytoplasmic region know signal motif . Binding either PD-L1 PD-L2 PD-1 inhibits T-cell activation trigger T-cell receptor . PD-L1 express low level various non-hematopoietic tissue , notably vascular endothelium ; whereas PD-L2 detectably-expressed antigen-presenting cell find lymphoid tissue chronic inflammatory environment . PD-L2 thought control immune T-cell activation lymphoid organ , whereas PDL1 serve dampen unwarranted T-cell function peripheral tissues.Although healthy organ express little ( ) PD-L1 , variety cancer demonstrate express abundant level T-cell inhibitor . High expression PD-L1 tumor cell ( less extent PD-L2 ) find correlate poor prognosis survival various cancer type , include RCC , pancreatic carcinoma , HCC , ovarian carcinoma . Furthermore , PD-1 suggest regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion patient melanoma . The observed correlation clinical prognosis PD-L1 expression multiple cancer suggest PD-1/PD-L1 pathway play critical role tumor immune evasion consider attractive target therapeutic intervention . MK-3475 ( previously know SCH 900475 ) potent highly selective humanize monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) IgG4/kappa isotype design directly block interaction PD-1 ligands , PD-L1 PD-L2 . This blockade enhance functional activity target lymphocytes facilitate tumor regression ultimately immune rejection . - Clinical experience MK-3475 Several clinical trial conduct advanced melanoma , non-small cell lung cancer , head neck cancer , urothelial tract cancer , triple negative breast cancer , gastric cancer , hematologic malignancy ( include smolder multiple myeloma ) . A phase I trial combination lenalidomide dexamethasone enrol MM patient . . - Rationale use anti-PD1 MoAb consolidation MM PD-L1 express MM plasma cell , PD-L1 overexpression enhance MM invasiveness render tumor cell less susceptible cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( CTLs ) . This effect alleviate anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment , demonstrate importance PD-1/PD-L1 pathway process . In addition , recent report demonstrate increased level PD-L1 MM cell together enhance PD-1 expression T cell `` exhaust '' phenotype . The immunosuppressive effect myeloma overcome PD-L1 blockade . ( 32 ) A Phase 1 clinical trial conduct advanced hematologic malignancy use CT-011 , show clinical response 6 17 patient include stable disease MM patient . Moreover , recent experiment perform group show MM patient serological complete remission residual disease clear overexpression molecule pathway tumor cell also T-lymphocytes . And clear compare MM patient immunophenotypic CR ( without residual cell bone marrow flow cytometry ) . This could suggest pathway may responsible , least partially , inability eradicate tumor cell patient .</detailed_description>
