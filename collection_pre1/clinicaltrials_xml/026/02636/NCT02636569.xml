	<brief_summary>This research study test well two topical medication work prevent development non-melanoma skin cancer reverse certain biomarkers skin . This study also look optimal dose medication small number people . Biomarkers molecule find body inside cell . Some biomarkers associate specific disease skin cancer . In study , two topical medication evaluate ; diclofenac alpha-difluoromethylornithine ( DFMO ) . Diclofenac DFMO approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use . 24 patient enrol study UAB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Men woman ( ≥ 18 yo ) see patient Dermatology Clinic University Alabama Birmingham history basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin least 8 actinic keratoses upper extremity potentially eligible study participation . We propose examine two topical medication , already FDA approve , use alone combination placebo comparator . The purpose study see diclofenac α-difluoromethylornithine ( DMFO ) apply daily need apply twice per day order achieve desire result . We examine level specific biomarkers skin associate risk develop skin cancer . We hope see level decrease daily twice daily use medication diclofenac DMFO use . Results study help guide u second study look long term use medication associate change skin biomarkers related skin cancer . The second longer study use dose ( twice daily topical application diclofenac DMFO ) result decrease biomarkers , discover currently propose study .</detailed_description>

Topical preparation contain corticosteroid vitamin A derivative ) area actinic damage duration study . Use moisturizers/emollients sunscreens area allow . Chronic ( define &gt; 3 times/week 2 consecutive weeks/year ) NSAID COX2 inhibitor use ( cardioprotective dos aspirin &lt; 100 mg po QD ) duration study . For routine analgesia , subject may take acetaminophen necessary . Normal organ marrow function define laboratory value fall within specify range follow test ( perform within 14 day registration ) Hematologic • WBC &gt; 3,000/ul • Hemoglobin &gt; low limit normal • Platelet count &gt; 100,000/ul Hepatic • Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X ULN • AST ( SGOT ) &lt; 1.5 X ULN ALT ( SPGT ) &lt; 1.5 X ULN Renal Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 X ULN BUN &lt; 1.5 X ULN Females childbearing potential must : Have use adequate contraception ( abstinence , IUD , birth control pills spermicidal gel diaphragm condom ) since last menses Have document negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior first dose study medication Females consider childbearing potential least 1 year postmenopausal tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy . The effect topical DFMO + topical diclofenac develop fetus unknown . Therefore female childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( abstinence , IUD , birth control pill , spermicidal gel diaphragm condom ) duration study participation . Within 6 month prior randomization : Use oral intravenous corticosteroid 2 consecutive week Use inhale corticosteroid 4 consecutive week Any follow 4 week ( indicate ) prior randomization : Major surgery indication Cytotoxic chemotherapy indication ( include methotrexate arthritis ) Anticancer treatment type stage 02 nonmelanoma skin cancer Hormonal therapy cancer prevention ( include tamoxifen ) Note : treatment finasteride/dutasteride BPH render participant ineligible . Radiation therapy Topical medication treatment actinic keratosis skin cancer ( retin A , 5FU , imiquimod ) 6 month prior randomization . Laser resurfacing , dermabrasion , cryotherapy , chemical peel electrodissection ± curettage 6 month prior randomization . Nasally inhaled corticosteroid ( except mometasone Nasonex ) Aspirin ( &gt; 100 mg/day ) Note : cardioprotective dos ( &lt; 100mg/day ) acceptable . NSAIDs ( aspirin &lt; 100mg/day ) COX2 inhibitor &gt; 3 times/week two week period Topical steroids Any personal history : Invasive cancer diagnose treat within past 5 year . Participants remission 5 year require treatment past 5 year may eligible principal investigator believe little risk recurrence . Solid organ bone marrow transplant Keloid formation Photosensitivity disorder Hypersensitivity adverse reaction nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent DFMO Any disease predisposes NMSC An immunodeficiency disorder use immunosuppressive drug Any skin disease would interfere interpretation result Any family history Ornithine diaminotransferase deficiency first degree relative Concurrent use follow medication treatment Anticoagulants include warfarin heparin Other NSAIDs ( aspirin &lt; 100 mg/day ) daily basis Topical chemotherapy , cryotherapy , radiotherapy skin lesion treatment area skin follow study Systemic therapy psoralens , immunotherapy , retinoids , radiation therapy Cytotoxic chemotherapy reason ( include methotrexate arthritis ) Laser resurfacing , dermabrasion chemical peel Topical systemic immunosuppressive therapy . Females pregnant lactating . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participate study notify study physician immediately . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include ongoing active infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement underlie serious medical condition , investigator 's opinion , might preclude study participation .</criteria>
