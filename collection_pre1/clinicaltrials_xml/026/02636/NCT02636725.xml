	<brief_title>Axitinib Pembrolizumab Subjects With Advanced Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study single-institution , open-label , single-arm phase II study . Since primary endpoint survival outcome , progression-free survival ( PFS ) sample size calculation base single-arm survival design . The investigator employ early stopping rule lack efficacy , base previously report historical control ( 19 % PFS 3 month ) large database suggest progression-free rate 3 month &gt; 40 % correlate active drug second-line setting patient advance sarcoma . Patients treat twice daily dose axitinib alone first 7 day , follow concurrent axitinib administer twice daily 5 mg orally ( PO ) , plus intravenous administration pembrolizumab every 21 day . Patients assess every three week toxicity . After first five patient enrol , investigator assess safety combination . If 2 few patient exhibit dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , investigator proceed intrapatient titration axitinib dose cycle base presence absence predefined toxicity . Correlative study characterize T-cells tumor tissue peripheral blood perform three timepoints : 1. pre-treatment , 2. on-treatment cycle 3 day 1 , 3. off-study . Additional exploratory image investigation , assessment circulate tumor cell include patient . Trial therapy last withdrawal consent , disease progression and/or unacceptable toxicity , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
