	<brief_title>Extension Study Drisapersen DMD Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase IIIb , multi-centre , open-label extension study male subject DMD previously treat drisapersen . This study aim enroll approximately 220 subject . The primary dosing arm drisapersen 6 mg/kg subcutaneous ( SC ) injection ( ) week . All subject start subcutaneous injection receive load dose twice weekly 6mg/kg drisapersen first three week treatment . This study minimum duration participation . Subjects vary time study participation depend enter one eligible study permit continue study time withdraw base protocol-defined criterion , BioMarin stop study . Subjects na√Øve treatment eligible participation study For subject previously experience significant safety tolerability issue one eligible study , experience study , potential alternate intermittent dose arm . This agree advance Medical Monitor . For subject previously experience significant injection site reaction earlier drisapersen study , experience similar reaction ( ) study , potential dose intravenously .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Any subject previously treat exon 51 skip antisense oligonucleotide ( drisapersen eteplirsen ) eligible another ongoing drisapersen study . Subjects withdraw previous study due meet laboratory safety stop criterion may eligible enroll : 2 . The laboratory parameter lead stop resolve ; benefit treatment drisapersen outweigh risk individual subject ; follow consultation Medical Monitor . 3 . Subjects DMD mutation/deletion within dystrophin gene correctable drisaperseninduced DMD exon 51 skipping . 4 . Male subject age &gt; 5 screening investigator considers treatment drisapersen likely lead improvement prevent worsen condition . 5 . Continued use glucocorticoid minimum 60 day prior study entry reasonable expectation subject remain glucocorticoids duration study . Changes cessation glucocorticoid discretion investigator conduct study consultation subject/parent Medical Monitor . 6 . Willing able comply study requirement procedure ( exception assessment require subject ambulant , subject lose ambulation ) . 7 . Able give inform assent and/or consent write subject and/or parent ( ) /legal guardian ( accord local regulation ) 1 . Subjects previously treat drisapersen serious adverse experience meet safety stop criterion remain unresolved , opinion investigator could attributable drisapersen . Once resolve , subject may eligible enter study follow investigator consultation Medical Monitor . 2 . Use anticoagulant , antithrombotics antiplatelet agent within 28 day first redo drisapersen . Chronic use anticoagulant , antithrombotics antiplatelet agent prohibit study . As needed dosing ( pro nata PRN ) may acceptable ( except aspirin ) follow discussion Medical Monitor . 3 . Participation investigational clinical trial within 3 month prior start study ( except drisapersen study ) . If subject participate study within last 6 month discuss Medical Monitor prior start study . 4 . History significant medical disorder may confound interpretation safety data ( e.g . current history renal liver disease/impairment , history inflammatory illness ) 5 . Symptomatic cardiomyopathy . If subject leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45 % start study , investigator discus inclusion subject study Medical Monitor . 6 . A platelet count lower limit normal ( LLN ) start study . A retest possible later stage , within normal range , subject may enter study .</criteria>
