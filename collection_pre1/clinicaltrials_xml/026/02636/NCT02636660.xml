	<brief_title>Health-related Quality Life Nursing-sensitive Outcomes Mechanically Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation ( MV ) one utilised therapeutic technique within intensive care unit ( ICU ) . It commonly use support patient diagnose severe respiratory failure , several complication document literature appear acute phase treatment later phase , become chronic problem case . Most complication related length treatment , could affect patient ' health-related quality life ( HRQL ) . HRQL conceptualisation vital analysis evaluation health-related outcome . Knowing patient 's health perception , wish motivate factor make decision related health , well apply procedure evaluate healthcare provider essential definition HRQL . Diagnosis treatment illness exclusively biomedical level addition technologically advanced procedure represent qualitative improvement patient survival recent decade , reduce holistic approach health care fight illness without promote patient welfare . From holistic perspective attempt quantify contribution nurse health-related outcome , term `` nursing-sensitive outcome '' ( NSO ) create . According National Quality Forum , indicator sensitive certain nursing intervention measurement process ' structure ( process outcome ) affect influenced intervention nurse , although responsibility share professional . The forum agree several NSO standard pressure ulcer care , infection control , fall prevention , expertise nursing team , patient satisfaction HRQL . Outcome evaluation knowledge HRQL mechanically ventilate critical care patient vital understanding therapeutic technique affect patient therefore design care strategy acute late phase treatment . The goal minimize unwanted effect improve cost-effectiveness , always consider patient 's perspective decision-making process . The analysis factor determine patient 's perception HRQL different phase illness well adaptation process unwanted result give u in-depth knowledge mechanism affect HRQL negative way therefore plan intervention promote optimal patient welfare . There great deal publish literature mechanically ventilate patient 's HRQL . All author agree quality life perceive patient bad perceived reference population , although determinant HRQL well define . Additionally , difference among critical care unit ( surgical , cardiac , general ) variety tool utilised measure HRQL make hard compare result . Highly specialise ICUs constitute stressful environment patient , related onset delirium acute confusional state phase disease , mid long-term repercussion memory loss , delusion neurophysiological disturbance effect HRQL perception describe . Some author study factor stressful effect mechanically ventilate patient find one bad remember stressful experience , aside thirst pain , endotracheal tube discomfort . There several tool assess stressor within ICU , allow u assess degree stress nuisance experience patient factor . One well-known Intensive Care Unit Environmental Stressor Scale ( ICUESS ) , allow u perform global evaluation ICU take account problem secondary tracheal intubation MV . Another tool recently describe HRQL study mechanically ventilate patient ICU Stressful Experience Questionnaire ( ICU-SEQ ) , evaluate general aspect ICU set also emphasize problem originate result orotracheal intubation MV . Knowing HRQL , stressor NSO influence allow u design implement strategy nurse care plan minimise negative effect address chronic problem , thereby improve patient 's welfare , security quality life . Setting The study carry Intensive Care Unit Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron , locate Barcelona , Spain , high-complexity hospital referral centre many disease process national level . Sample size According data previously collect department , total 360 patient meet inclusion criterion study timeframe . Assuming possible loss high mortality rate within critical care , final cohort expect 200 patient . Sampling technique A non-probabilistic convenience sampling use , include patient admitted ICU . Variables The following variable collect : anthropometric sociodemographic data data related ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , NSO , HRQL ICU stressor . Assessment Tools To assess HRQL , Short-Form-36 Health Survey ( SF-36 ) use . For specific assessment respiratory issue , Saint Georges Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) use . Both questionnaire validate Spanish . To evaluate ICU stressor , ICU Stressful Experience Questionnaire ( ICU-SEQ ) use . This tool create Rotondi modify Samuelson . In addition evaluate general ICU experience , also evaluate experience related endotracheal tube . To translate adapt ICU-SEQ Spanish , follow process use : 1 . Translation back translation Spanish two bilingual translator . 2 . Transcultural adaptation via pilot study assess proper comprehension different item . Data Collection Data collect 12 consecutive month . Patient selection study cohort perform research team evaluate patient may need need MV . Follow documentation provide mechanically ventilated patient . When patient mechanically ventilate 48 hour , informed consent obtain next kin . From moment , patient data medical record gather MV discontinue . One week patient discharge ICU , inform consent obtain patient . Approaching patient earlier consider inappropriate research team . If patient agrees participate study , SF-36 , SGRQ ICU-SEQ questionnaire provide patient complete . The questionnaire give main caregiver time . One year ICU discharge , questionnaire complete patient ass persistency stressor ' sequela . Data Analysis A descriptive analysis carry variable . Mean standard deviation utilise quantitative variable follow normal distribution . For rest variable , median , maximum minimum value use . Qualitative variable describe utilising absolute frequency percentage value category . Statistical analysis HRQL result perform questionnaire 's different dimension well questionnaire whole . To compare result obtained time ICU discharge obtain one year discharge , Student 's t-test Wilcoxon test apply pair data depend variable distribution . This analysis also depend length MV . A multiple regression model elaborate utilising HRQL result variable . Relevant clinical situation ( number transfusion surgical intervention , pressure ulcer , nosocomial infectionsâ€¦ ) consider independent variable . All analysis perform 95 % confidence interval . Limitations Bias The main limitation study patient 's quality life one year ICU discharge could affect non-identifiable event relation study . The main bias patient 's memory patient ask event may difficult recall . Ethical consideration This study approve Ethics Committee Clinical Investigation Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron . Informed consent obtain patient main caregiver , always make sure participant ' confidentiality anonymity preserve process .</detailed_description>
