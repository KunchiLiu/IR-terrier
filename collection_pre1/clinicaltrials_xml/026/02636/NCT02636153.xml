	<brief_title>Effects Different Dietary Phosphorus Intake Circadian Pattern Serum Phosphate Normal Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emerging evidence show serum phosphate concentration associate cardiovascular all-cause mortality chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient , also associate mortality community population ( without history CKD cardiovascular disease ) . The rise serum phosphate lead elevation serum plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) healthy people , contribute bone disorder leave ventricle thickening . Therefore , maintain normal serum phosphate reduce postprandial fluctuation serum phosphate essential CKD patient well healthy people . As serum phosphate modulation diet , evidence focus CKD patient , less focused healthy people . An American study 1980s indicate phosphorus intake significantly relate level 24-h serum phosphate circadian pattern serum phosphate . However , study fail explore underlying mechanism diet America different China . Nowadays , normal diet China incline calorie protein , warrant high diet phosphorus intake , may contribute huge fluctuation serum phosphate thus elevate incidence mortality cardiovascular disease . Therefore , level circadian pattern serum phosphate concentration normal subject native normal diet China ? Is restricted phosphate diet able alter level circadian pattern serum phosphate ? These question investigator sare eager answer . Accumulating evidence suggest gastrointestinal tract vital effect phosphate modulation . Berndt etc . suggest rat , epidermal cell duodenum jejunum could sense gastrointestinal tract phosphate load , rapidly activate type IIa Na/Pi-cotransporter renal tubule cell , lead increase urinary phosphate , without change serum FGF23 , PTH phosphate concentration . So author propose gastro intestine-kidney axis phosphate modulation . However , whether axis exists human body remain unclear . Therefore , investigator plan conduct crossover clinical study evaluate level circadian pattern serum phosphate concentration modulate native normal diet restrict phosphate diet explore underlying mechanism .</detailed_description>
