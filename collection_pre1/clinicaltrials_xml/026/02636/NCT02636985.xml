	<brief_summary>Elastography image tissue elasticity stiffness currently emerge mainstream tool ultrasound-based diagnosis . This compressibility property material , mathematically express change tissue displacement function distance compress device , know strain parameter image elastogram . Elastography currently show promise result differentiate viscoelastic nature various organ , consequence certain underlying disease . At present , limited literature reveal application feasibility ultrasonic elastography lung lesion . This essentially important may serve adjuvant B-mode ultrasound . The investigator aim explore application feasibility ultrasonic elastography lung lesion .</brief_summary>
