	<detailed_description>Introduction Five percent Canadians suffer Chronic Rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) base national survey.1 CRS sufferer debilitate facial pain , nasal congestion , nasal discharge poor sense smell . Relative chronic disease , quality life patient suffer CRS comparable disease congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , angina back pain.3 Currently , CRS patient Vancouver , British Columbia wait year surgery . British Columbia 's ( BC ) health care policy recommend CRS patient wait surgery do twelve week . It well recognize patient wait longer medically reasonable surgery result excess cost , directly patient , healthcare system economy whole.5 Unfortunately , study do Canada illustrate direct indirect cost associate CRS annually . Patients ' wait time elective sinus surgery BC come public scrutiny recent year . As result , policy-makers keen address waitlist issue.4 The government identify sinus surgery elective day procedure require Patient Focused Fund ( PFF ) increase volume address disproportionately large waitlist . This likely result saving VCH patient BC Health Ministry would occur PFF initiate . However , policy-makers must explore innovate way supplement PFF provide saving VCH patient BC health care system . An approach adopt speciality orthopaedics , ophthalmology , radiology use validate tool prioritize waitlists.6-8 There validated tool publish prioritize sinus surgery waitlists . The Canadian Institutes Health Research provide fund establish Western Canada Waiting List Project ( WCWL ) `` improve fairness health care system Canadians ' access appropriate effective medical service prioritize basis need potential benefit . `` 9 Despite work do WCWL limit five clinical area ( cataract surgery ; general surgery procedure ; hip knee replacement ; magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanning , child 's mental health ) , methodology utilized establish prioritization tool use establish one sinus surgery waitlist ; 10 The impact chronic disease , include CRS , vary among patients11 ; therefore , prioritize patient base clinical measurement cost-effectiveness individual healthcare system perspective would novel approach address waitlists sinus surgery . Currently , VCH CRS patient treat first come , first serve basis . Despite transparent way order waitlist , investigator feel VCH CRS patient need waitlist system promote wellness ensures care focus quality - achieve prioritized waitlist base quality life improvement decrease healthcare expenditure . Prior establish validated tool prioritization sinus surgery waitlists , one must first determine VCH patient BC health care system would benefit prioritized surgery . Providing solution question require moderate amount resource would take several year complete . The investigator propose feasibility study couple economic evaluation determine disproportionately long wait list face CRS patient optimize thus improve patient outcomes . Current State Knowledge Researchers must determine CRS patient BC health care system would benefit prioritized waitlist sinus surgery . It accept sinus surgery compare medical therapy improve quality life CRS patients.12-14 However , determine whether VCH CRS patient would benefit prioritized waitlist , investigator must answer follow question . If patient surgery sooner : 1 ) quality life change time compare waitlist ? 2 ) experience reduction pocket cost ? ; 3 ) healthcare system experience decrease healthcare expenditure ? 4 ) subgroup patient would particularly benefit others early surgical intervention ? Providing information vital determine prioritized waitlist would beneficial sinus surgery . Patient Recruitment : Recruitment patient occur two centre . Patients classify `` prioritize surgery '' recruit Stanford Sinus Centre , Palo Alto , California . Patients classify `` standard waitlist '' patient recruit Vancouver General Hospital , Vancouver , Canada . The PI identify consecutive patient fit inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol sinus surgery . The study coordinator ( designate ) discus study identify patient allow patient 7 day provide consent . On day consent : A diagnosis patient 's medical health conduct study investigator Lund-Mackay Lund-Kennedy score system use assess patient 's chronic rhinosinusitis . Additionally , state rhinosinusitis evaluate day consent every subsequent follow-up visit . A questionnaire relate demographic obtain well ( Appendix D ) . Approach Each Aim : Aim 1 : The investigator compare quality life CRS patient change time prioritize early surgical intervention compare standard waitlist . All CRS patient participate study fill disease-specific health relate quality life instrument CRS patient know Sinonasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-22 ) two generic assessment health status know WPAI-SHP EQ-5D ( Appendix A ) every 2 month 1 year . The study coordinator ( designate ) contact patient every 2 month via email provide secure link fill questionnaire . When questionnaires complete , save directly medical record . Rationale Questionnaires : The Sinonasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-22 ) validate questionnaire.16 SNOT-22 disease-specific health-related quality life instrument CRS patient . The EQ-5D 5 question address : mobility , self-care , usual activity , pain/discomfort , anxiety/depression . The Work Productivity Activity - Specific Health Problem ( WPAI : SHP ) validate instrument evaluate impairment daily activity work productivity associate specific health problem ( Chronic Rhinosinusitis ) . The work productivity impairment domain sum impairment work productivity due absenteeism due decrease productivity work ( presenteeism ) ; domain assess employed patient . The activity impairment domain assess participant regardless employment status represent impairment daily activity work.18 The investigator would prefer use easy administer generic health measure like EQ-5D compare WPAI-SHP , feasibility stage , investigator administer questionnaire completion study determine appropriate questionnaire study . Aim 2 : To determine patient prioritize early surgical intervention experience reduction pocket cost compare patient standard waitlist . All CRS patient participate study fill questionnaire regard personal cost incur 1 year . To ensure accurate cost tabulate , patient fill questionnaire every two month ( Appendix B ) . The study coordinator ( designate ) contact patient every two month via email provide secure link fill question Appendix B similar Aim 1 . The study coordinator ( designate ) follow protocol contact patient questionnaire fill timely manner . Patients also complete Aim hard copy similar Aim 1 . To ensure investigator inclusive cost incur CRS patient , sample population 30 VCH CRS patient survey . Moreover , panel include multiple Rhinologists Health Economist establish question pertinent cost incur patient may overlook sample population . This process ensure accurate estimate personal cost incur CRS patient wait surgery prioritize early surgery . ( Appendix B ) Aim 3 : The investigator determine Canadian health care system experience decrease healthcare expenditure CRS patient enlist early surgical intervention versus patient standard waitlist . When VCH CRS patient address Aim 2 , also additional question pertain cost incur health care system ( Appendix B ) . The PI fill questionnaire regard cost incur health care system 1 year patient believe cost public system atypical compare expect cost ( Appendix C ) . During clinical patient , PI tabulate cost incur patient 's clinical visit . Like Aim 2 , panel consist multiple Rhinologists establish Appendix C. Moreover , three clinical day PI , extra cost incur VCH health care system note included Appendix C. Aim 4 : The investigator determine subgroup CRS patient would benefit early surgical intervention . Stratification VCH CRS patient determine patient benefit early surgical intervention establish demographic information , clinical finding comparison outcome obtain Aims 1-3 . Demographic information obtain day consent obtain ( Appendix D ) . The PI also complete standardize consultation/follow-up form visit report clinical finding . The PI also complete standardize consultation/follow-up form , include evaluation heal subsequent nasal surgery base Lund-Kennedy score , visit document clinical finding . Analysis : Pre-Study Sample Size Calculation - Sample size comparison average difference SNOT-22 score two equally size group time follow Diggle et al formula.19 Based effect size 9 points15 early intervention standard waitlist patient , type 1 probability 5 % ( α = 0.05 ) , type 2 probability 20 % ( β = 0.20 ) , standard deviation 20 pre- post surgical values15 6 measurement SNOT-22 12 month , assume correlation ( p ) range 0.75 1.00 124 156 patient recruit , therefore allow conservative estimate 10 % drop-out . Post-Study Completion - Aim 1 analyze use 2-sample t-test . The investigator conduct cost-utility analysis evaluate Aims 2 3. investigator assume cost surgery early intervention group receive standard waitlist ; therefore , cost remove early intervention group . The economic model evaluate cost utility ( measure EQ-5D WPAI-SHP ) calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICERs ) . The time horizon evaluation 1 year . No discounting cost utility require give time horizon . Uncertainty around ICERs quantify use bootstrapping . Aim 4 analyze use linear regression model . The best-fit model provide insight sub-population CRS patient would benefit early surgical intervention .</detailed_description>
