	<brief_title>Evaluation Three Pulp Vitality Tests</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior start endodontic treatment , essential determine vitality tooth question . Vitality tooth define presence blood flow tooth . The vitality status tooth affect success endodontic treatment , therefore play important role treatment plan . Two establish method determine vitality electric pulp test cold test . However , method drawback . Both method use presence sensory feedback tooth predictor tooth vitality . This lead error blood flow nerve tooth may lose different time , result false-positive false-negative response . Both subjective patient-dependent , rely patient indicate pain felt . In addition , study suggest electric pulp test cold test reliable immature teeth , teeth undergo orthodontic movement , traumatize teeth , teeth significant secondary dentin . Laser Doppler flowmetry technique utilizes Doppler principle determine blood flow . It use widely medical field measure blood flow skin . Some study also show good result measure blood flow pulp teeth . The objective study determine sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , accuracy laser Doppler flowmetry determine vitality teeth compare electric pulp test cold testing .</detailed_description>
