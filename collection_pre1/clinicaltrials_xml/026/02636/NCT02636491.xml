	<brief_title>Use Automated Insulin Delivery System Compared Sensor Augmented Pump Patients With Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 45 eligible patient enrol participate two crossover session 60 hour consecutive day , closed-loop sensor-augmented pump therapy ( Minimed ®Paradigm ) . The sequence session randomly assign . The randomization block randomization ( 1:1 ) . Patients assign one follow arm : Group A : 60 hour closed-loop control 60 hour sensor augment pump therapy Group B : 60 hour use sensor augment pump therapy 60 hour closed-loop control . Subjects enrol accord follow schedule/ successive phase : Phase 1 : 5 Adult subject : After adult subject complete study 2nd enrollment phase start . Phase 2 : 5 Adolescent subject age 14-18 . After subject complete study 3rd enrollment phase start . Phase 3 : 5 Children age 10-14 enrol . The enrollment phase 2 phase 3 start participant previous phase complete study safety efficacy system analyze base occurrence ( serious ) adverse Events ( AE ) issue relevant patient 's safety . If observe AEs device problem exceed amount severity risk expect regular diabetes therapy recruitment next age category consider reasonable medical point view , next enrollment phase started.Screening Failures replace get total 45 complete patients.The average duration study participation subject complete study estimate approximately 28-56 day . The estimate duration total study 6 months.In study 45 patient include , 15 plan enrol Germany . The study consist 5 visit ( 3 clinical visit 2 visit do phone ) follow : - Visit 1 : Screening , eligibility , enrolment sensor diabetes guideline train . ( Day - 21 ) - Run-in period - Visit 2 : Randomization preparation visit outpatient period . ( Day 0 ) - Intervention session 1 ( weekday Intervention session 2 ) - Visit 3 : Phone call visit arm . ( Day 4 ) - Washout period - Visit 4 : Phone call visit session 2 ( Day 18 ) - Intervention session 2 ( weekday Intervention session 1 ) - Visit 5 : Final visit . ( Day 21 ) There follow visit observation plan end study subject discontinue study participation . In case Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) follow period SAE resolved/ recover plan .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject Type 1 diabetes ( &gt; 1yr since diagnosis ) 2 . Insulin infusion pump ( CSII ) therapy least 3 month 3 . Patients use Continuous glucose monitoring system 4 . Age ≥ 10 year 65 year 5 . HbA1c inclusion ≥ 7 &lt; 10 6 . Patients willing follow study instruction 7 . Patients live least one adult person 8 . BMI SDS ( Standard Deviation Scores ) 95th percentile age32 9 . Patients care giver capable operate computer base system . 1 . Concomitant disease influence metabolic control ( e.g . anemia , significantly impair hepatic function , renal failure , History adrenal insufficiency ) medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , may compromise patient safety follow example : Abnormal liver renal function ( Transaminase &gt; 2 time upper limit normal , Creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ) Subject follow diagnosis within 1 year screening : myocardial infarction , unstable angina , coronary artery disease congestive heart failure , coronary artery surgery , transient ischemic attack , cerebrovascular accident , uncontrolled hypertension , ventricular rhythm disturbance thromboembolic disease Note : Adequately treat thyroid disease celiac disease exclude subject enrollment 2 . Participation interventional study 3 . Known suspect allergy trial product adhesive , tape , needle . An allergy contrast medium , use active medical device ( pacemaker , ICD ) plan image examination ( MRI ) . 4 . Any significant disease condition include psychiatric disorder substance abuse , opinion investigator , likely affect subject 's ability complete study , compromise patient safety 5 . Diabetic ketoacidosis past 1 month . 6 . Severe hypoglycemia six month prior enrollment . 7 . Current use follow medication : medication use low blood glucose Pramilintide , Metformin GLP1 ( Glucagonlike Peptide1 ) analog . Beta blocker , glucocorticoid medication , judgment investigator would contraindication participation study 8 . Subject participate another drug device study could affect glucose measurement glucose management . 9 . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding planning become pregnant within plan study duration . 10 . Not sufficient vision hear recognize pump/ sensor alarm perform blood glucose self measurement 4times daily . 11 . Relevant severe organ disorder ( diabetic nephropathy , diabetic retinopathy , , diabetic foot syndrome ) secondary disease complication diabetes mellitus Subject unstable rapidly progressive renal disease receive dialysis Subject active proliferating retinopathy Active gastroparesis 12 . Patient suffers eat disorder</criteria>
