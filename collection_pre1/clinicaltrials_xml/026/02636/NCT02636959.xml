	<brief_title>A Postoperative Study HVSI v LVSI Treatment Chronic Rhinosinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic Rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) common inflammatory condition upper respiratory tract last 8 12 week . Major symptom include facial congestion/fullness , facial pain/pressure , nasal obstruction/blockage , purulent nasal drainage , reduction loss smell . The diagnosis must include two major symptom either endoscopic evidence polyp , edema mucopurulent discharge middle meatus and/or CT change mucosa sinus osteomeatal complex . CRS estimate prevalence 5 % Canadian population , 16 % adult population United States . Sinusitis associate major societal health care burden , cost billion dollar year North America . The medical treatment CRS include topical saline corticosteroid spray , systemic steroid antimicrobial . Specifically , saline nasal irrigation ( SNI ) safe , nonpharmacologic treatment , important efficacious component management CRS . SNI vary concentration ( e.g . hypertonic , isotonic , hypotonic ) device ( e.g . bulb syringe , nasal mist , squeeze bottle ) . The Mayo Clinic recently review major expert consensus guideline medical treatment CRS . Although recognize overall paucity control trial medical treatment , lack consensus algorithm treatment CRS , overall consensus agreement use SNI population . In review , mention treatment CRS postoperative period , recommendation type SNI best . Few study examine various SNI formulation postoperative period . These highlight Canadian author recent exhaustive review SNI sinusitis . Three study , great 15 year old , include formulation currently popular use , even available North America . These show pressurize jet spray seawater effective nasal drop . More recently , Harvey et al . examine irrigation deliver retain sinus , use common device . In cadaveric model , compare high volume saline nasal irrigation ( HVSI ) low volume saline nasal irrigation ( LVSI ) device find great delivery ( p &lt; 0.02 ) former . To date study compare HVSI LVSI , use subjective patient benefit objective endoscopic measure outcomes , postoperative CRS patient . One study examine two different SNI device management CRS . The author recruit 150 subject CRS primary care setting , randomize two week SNI bulb syringe , SNI nasal irrigation pot , control group reflexology massage . Hypertonic saline use treatment group . Subjective questionnaire administer baseline end study period . Both group significantly improve , significant difference two SNI device . Patients equally prefer two device . Popular HVSI LVSI formulation patient physician NeilMed® Sinus Rinse™ Salinex® , respectively . These two example positive pressure treatment , enjoy widespread usage North America precede sufficient evidence-based medicine demonstrate safety efficacy . This likely topical saline spray consider safe ; require prescription perhaps importantly massive marketing campaign surround SNI device . SNI device receive significant news coverage appearance major television show , include Oprah Winfrey Show , New York Times , numerous internet video . PURPOSE : The purpose study determine clinical benefit high volume saline nasal irrigation ( HVSI ) low volume saline irrigation ( LVSI ) postoperative period patient chronic Rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) . This study part multicenter collaborative project initiate Macdonald et al . However , sample size consider sufficient conclude significantly different effect two saline volume ( i.e . 86 participant ) ; determine sample size 176 ( 88 condition ) require ( see attach Section 9.8 ) . To achieve , role collect data ( plus four Canadian rhinology research centre ) 20 patient add finding establish acceptable significant result . This information would help otolaryngologist , family physician , health care professional recommend best post-operative SNI ( saline nasal irrigation ) device patient CRS . HYPOTHESES : We hypothesize advantage HVSI ( NeilMed® Sinus Rinse™ ) LVSI ( Salinex® ) early post-operative management patient chronic rhinosinusitis . The mechanical effect high volume irrigation help ensure large surface area sinonasal mucosa debrided cleanse . RESEARCH METHOD : This multicenter , randomize , single blind , control prospective study evaluate subjective objective outcome HSVI versus LSVI patient endoscopic sinus surgery ( ESS ) CRS . One month postoperative score compare preoperative score . The expected total number patient enrol study approximately 100 ( 20 patient per 5 institution ) , plan completion time one year . We approach 20 patient offer ESS CRS part study . Pre-operative document include consent form participate research study , two subjective questionnaire ( SNOT-22 Nasal Sinus Symptom Score ) complete patient objective endoscopy scale ( POSE ) complete surgeon . Preoperative CT scan usually obtain patient ESS CRS . These grade use Lund-McKay score . Finally , endoscopic sinonasal photo take resource specific institution allow . These scale describe detail . Evaluation Tests The Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 ( SNOT-22 ) survey rhinology-specific quality life instrument , base 22 item . It subjective scale complete patient . A low score represent good quality life . The SNOT-22 commonly use clinical research , reliable , valid , responsive , easy use . The Nasal Sinus Symptom Score rhinology-specific questionnaire base 5 item . Patients rate severity symptoms `` None '' `` Severe '' . The Perioperative Sinus Endoscopy ( POSE ) score system develop Canada use endoscopically assess sinonasal cavity patient ESS . The surgeon assess inflammatory status sinonasal cavity content , include middle turbinate , middle meatus , ethmoid cavity , frontal recess/sinus sphenoid sinus . Each site grade 0 2 depend degree inflammation and/or purulence see . A total score calculate total 20 , depend extent surgery . This scale compare well similar validate scale Lund-McKay endoscopy stag system . The Lund-McKay score use quantify sinonasal inflammation CT scan . Each follow give score 0-2 depend degree opacification : anterior ethmoid , posterior ethmoid , maxillary sinus , sphenoid sinus , frontal sinus , osteomeatal unit . At total score calculate 24 , high score indicate severe disease . This scale also widely use assessment CRS , reliable valid . Intervention/Treatment : On day surgery , patient provide box contain either HVSI ( NeilMed SINUS RINSE ) LVSI ( Salinex® ) . The patient randomize use computer software program , box contain spray regardless one use . The direction irrespective system give : two spray nostril two time daily . In way surgeon blind whether patient HVSI LVSI . The patient clearly instruct NOT tell surgeon device give . In addition , surgeon involve study instruct NEVER ask patient device use . Harms discomfort : Saline irrigation , HVSI LVSI , consider safe treatment adverse effect . Occasionally patient feel discomfort , well-tolerated therapy . We perceive risk treatment . Patients may withdraw study time reason . This affect patient care way . Sinus surgeon routinely prescribe medication preoperative period , include antibiotic topical and/or systemic steroid . Surgeons instruct treat patient , preoperatively normally would , alteration treatment randomize saline irrigation bottle . At one month postoperatively , patient reassess clinic . The SNOT-22 , Nasal Sinus Symptoms Score ( patient ) , POSE ( surgeon ) questionnaire complete , endoscopic photo take . Preoperative one-month postoperative SNOT-22 , Nasal Sinus Symptoms Score , POSE score HVSI LVSI compare determine significant difference subjective and/or objective outcome . Patients stratify accord disease severity use preoperative questionnaire Lund-McKay score determine patient vary disease severity benefit one delivery device . We hope involve 5 sinus surgeon across Canada , mostly academic tertiary care institution . Each surgeon involve 20 patient study , total study recruitment 100 patient . Each surgeon submit proposal his/her institution 's Research Ethics Board . The data 5 surgeon collect primary investigator ( AJ ) . Data send confidential manner secure fax . Patient names specific identifier include correspondence . PROPOSED DATA ANALYSIS : Data enter Excel spreadsheet statistical analysis apply Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) vs.13 . A total sample size calculate 100 patient ( 5 surgeon , 20 patient per surgeon institution ) would yield useful achievable analysis without overly cumbersome . Because lack research area , achieve study number alone would represent significant achievement . Subsequently , data 100 patient would add previously determine 86 ( send Dr. Macdonald Toronto ) , place onto spreadsheet analyze . Implications research : As state , result may provide needed evidence common trend among Otolaryngologists . This first study document value different volume spray treat postoperative sinus surgery ; result potentially publishable major journal would represent major collaborative effort among Canadian Otolaryngologists . It would help maintain University British Columbia 's Division Otolaryngology 's reputation world-class research .</detailed_description>
