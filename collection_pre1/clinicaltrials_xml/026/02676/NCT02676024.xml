	<brief_summary>In-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest important public health problem affect almost 6000 child year United States . As many 3 % patient admit child 's hospital require cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) . Only minority child survive , around 35 % go poor neurological outcome . International consensus guideline science treatment recommendation management pediatric resuscitation exist decade revise periodically International Liaison Committee Resuscitation ( ILCOR ) base available evidence . This consensus use national council American Heart Association ( AHA ) Heart Stroke Foundation Canada ( HSFC ) make guideline care . These guideline focus structure approach resuscitation , emphasize rapid implementation key intervention start chest compression , administer epinephrine defibrillation . The goal study improve outcome cardiac arrest child improve adherence consensus guideline . The investigator aim achieve conduct multi-center , prospective , factorial randomize study participate site International Network Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation , Research Education ( INSPIRE ) . The specific aim study : 1 . To evaluate effectiveness knowledge-based cognitive aid , namely Pediatric Advanced Life Support ( PALS ) algorithm card , healthcare team . 2 . To evaluate effectiveness teamwork-based cognitive aid , namely Cognitive Aids Roles Defined ( CARD ) system , healthcare team . 3 . To determine synergistic effect add CARD system use knowledge-based cognitive aid indeed whether use tool together unintended consequence reduces add value technique . 4 . A secondary aim identify whether additional simulation-based team training use cognitive aid result significant improvement performance e-learning module . The investigator hypothesize ( ) knowledge-based cognitive aid significantly improve performance healthcare team provide PALS simulate setting , ( ii ) teamwork-based cognitive aid ( CARD ) significantly improve performance healthcare team provide PALS simulate setting , ( iii ) add CARD system knowledge-based aid add synergistic effect , ( iv ) team performance study arm improve simulation base training , group cognitive aid continue out-perform group without cognitive aid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study utilize prospective , randomize control , factorial study design , examines effect integrate different element cognitive aid train pediatric resuscitation team member . Recruited participant ask perform member multi-professional pediatric resuscitation team . The study use simulation-based training primary method evaluate effect knowledge- team-based cognitive aid team performance , measure adherence PALS guideline . Participants team multi-professional ( physician , registered nurse , register respiratory therapist ) resuscitation pediatric healthcare provider . All participant undertake pre-test scenario , without access either cognitive aid , regardless group allocation . Participants randomize one four study arm use list generate independent statistician . Randomization stratify institution equal number team study arm participate institution multi-center study . In study arm 1 ( control ) , resuscitation team participate simulate pediatric cardiac arrest scenario , provide standard CPR without provide cognitive aid . Participants group allow use cognitive aid happen keep would normally use practice , example , flash card smart phone apps . In study arm 2 ( knowledge-aid ) , resuscitation team participate scenario without use CARD system train use knowledge-based cognitive aid , use dedicate team member ( cognitive aid `` reader '' `` co-pilot '' ) . In study arm 3 ( CARD ) , participant train use cognitive aid role define ( CARD ) system give knowledge-based cognitive aid dedicate cognitive aid reader team . In study arm 4 ( integrate cognitive aid ) , participant train use CARD system also use protocol-based cognitive aid , use dedicate cognitive aid reader . All group undertake 30-minute e-learning module . E-learning module develop illustrate principle crisis resource management use text , image short video ( simulated scenario ) illustrate high- low- performance leadership , teamwork task management . For control group , content focus team training principle PALS algorithm . For knowledge-aid group , content also focus team training principle PALS algorithm add introduction principle use knowledge-based cognitive aid provide cognitive aid `` reader '' designate team leader use `` do-verify '' approach cognitive aid . For CARD group , content also focus team training principle PALS algorithm add introduction principle CARD system . For integrated cognitive aid group , content focus team training principle PALS algorithm add introduction principle CARD system principle use knowledge-based cognitive aid provide cognitive aid `` reader '' designate team leader use `` do-verify '' approach cognitive aid . All participant undergo post-test scenario , cognitive aid provide per group allocation . All study arm undertake 2 simulation-based training scenario , cognitive aid per group allocation , follow standardize , script debrief expert facilitator include focus use cognitive aid provide , order delineate additional effect simulation-based learn e-learning module . All group undergo second post-test scenario , cognitive aid provide per group allocation . Participants ask complete demographic questionnaire questionnaire use cognitive aid . In order standardize scenario site , investigator script content scenario , include set transition one clinical state another , program response expect intervention , pre-set duration . The scenario pilot main study site video circulate site pilot location . Scenario assessment ( pre-test , post-test 1 post-test 2 ) One 12-minute pediatric cardiac arrest resuscitation scenario develop address PALS-based cognitive clinical performance , well compliance American Heart Association guideline . This scenario two phase : first non-shockable rhythm arrest ( six minute ) second shockable rhythm arrest ( six minute ) . The case history arrest exact rhythms different phase prevent familiarity scenario expect management arrest minimize variation difficulty scenario pre-test post-test : 1 . Pre-test : myocarditis ; asystole/ventricular fibrillation 2 . Post-test 1 : respiratory failure ; pulse-less electrical activity/ventricular fibrillation 3 . Post-test 2 : sepsis ; pulse-less electrical activity/ventricular tachycardia The scenario design test clinical performance cardiac arrest algorithm . To ensure consistency delivery scenario recruitment site , site provide pre-programmed scenario script simulation facilitator , outline specifically run scenario , introduce patient , how/when provide verbal cue resuscitation team . During pre-study run-in phase , recruitment center conduct transmit 2 successful case scenario use format research coordinate center . This allow investigator confirm adequate quality audiovisual content sound site allow conduct submit data site . Videos data collect run-in phase analyze inclusion main study . Participants recruit phase eligible inclusion study . Scenarios teach ( teach scenario 1 , teach scenario 2 ) The investigator use different scenario teach scenario 1 2 , assessment scenario . The investigator want ensure learn effect see post-test due either ( ) use different cognitive aid , ( b ) learn debrief simulation scenario familiarity do scenario three time row . The investigator acknowledge real life many different clinical scenario therefore many appropriate knowledge-based cognitive aid . Therefore , investigator plan knowledge-based cognitive aid group integrate group select appropriate cognitive aid scenario . The scenario teaching : 1 . Pediatric tachycardia pulse poor perfusion 2 . Pediatric bradycardia pulse poor perfusion All recruitment sit utilize make/brand pediatric simulator study . The Laerdal SimBaby widely use across Canada Unites States capable reproduce physiological response medical intervention . This simulator connect monitor vital sign ( heart rhythm , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation , blood pressure , temperature ) displayed . Through computer interface , operator run pre-programmed scenario vital sign monitor physical finding simulator change real time . The mannequin capable produce heart sound , breath sound palpable pulse . The simulator bag-mask ventilate , trachea intubate heart defibrillate . Our cardiac arrest scenario pre-programmed simulator ensure consistency recruitment site study group . The investigator ensure much standardization possible center physical environment scenario , include availability location equipment , include similar sized room . Video rating multiple independent raters expertise simulation pediatric resuscitation , blind research question . Raters train use assessment tool primary investigator co-investigators use video conferencing technology . The rater training process consist ( ) short tutorial use rating tool , ( ii ) rater independently rating similar scenario use study ( use analysis ) , ( iii ) group discussion rating lead principle investigator order resolve difference obtain consensus .
