	<brief_summary>This research trial study skin/soft tissue elasticity head neck cancer survivor lymphedema fibrosis . Lymphedema fibrosis common effect head neck cancer may lead skin tightness , pain , body image issue . Early detection lymphedema fibrosis may help reduce serious functional loss neck . Shear wave elastography technique provide quantitative measure stiffness use push pulse generate shear wave within tissue . Conventional image technique use monitor shear wave generate tissue calculate shear wave speed . Shear wave elastography may help obtain early accurate measurement tissue elasticity head neck cancer survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain pilot data elasticity skin/soft tissue use shear wave elasticity define anatomical site head neck cancer survivor lymphedema fibrosis ( LEF ) . II . To explore correlation elasticity skin/soft tissue follow : 1 ) symptom measure Lymphedema Symptom Intensity Distress Survey-Head Neck ( LSIDS-HN ) ; 2 ) functional impact measure Cervical Range Motion Device Vanderbilt Head Neck Symptom Survey ; 3 ) physical exam finding measure Head Neck LEF Grading Criteria . OUTLINE : Participants evaluate LEF status use Head Neck External Lymphedema - Fibrosis ( HN-LEF ) Grading Criteria neck range motion use Cervical Range Motion Device . Participants also complete study questionnaire , include Vanderbilt Head Neck Symptom Survey ( VHNSS ) Lymphedema Symptom Intensity Distress Survey - Head Neck ( LSIDS-H &amp; N ) . Participants undergo ultrasound shear wave elastography 20-25 minute . Participants ' cancer disease treatment information gather medical record .</detailed_description>
