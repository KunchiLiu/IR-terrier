	<brief_title>Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Kaatsu Training Women With Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stress urinary incontinence ( SU ) common problem among adult woman . Pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) recommend first line treatment PFMT always efficient woman comply intensive PFMT need obtain effect weaken damage muscle cause vaginal delivery age relate change . Hypothetically alternative method could use enhance effect strength-training program . A low intensity training program simultaneous partial occlusion blood supply train muscle , call `` Kaatsu '' training find increase muscle strength faster ordinary strength train much less effort . It seem difficult make occlusion pelvic floor muscle PFMT study find low intensity training quadriceps femoris partial occlusion blood supply increase muscle strength quadriceps femoris muscle also biceps humeri muscle muscle train low-load training occlusion training session . The specific reason `` cross-transfer effect '' could fully explain believe caused systemic effect cause growth hormone . The aim study therefore examine Kaatsu training offer relation low-load PFMT program increase effect PFMT woman SUI</detailed_description>
