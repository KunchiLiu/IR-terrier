	<brief_summary>The study multi-center , randomize , surgical trial woman symptomatic post-hysterectomy apical ( cuff ) prolapse desire surgical treatment . This study compare three available surgical treatment perform usual practice . The purpose study compare two commonly perform mesh apical repair ( sacral colpopexy vs. Apical Transvaginal Mesh ) vaginal native tissue apical repair mesh reinforce repair . The primary outcome measure time ( 60 month ) use survival analysis approach . The investigator hypothesize treatment failure differ vaginally abdominally place mesh vault vaginal prolapse , mesh repair ( regardless route implantation ) superior native tissue apical suspension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apical Suspension Repair Vault Prolapse In Three-Arm Randomized Trial Design</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose three arm randomize clinical trial determine apical transvaginal mesh placement non-inferior sacral colpopexy anatomic correction post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse determine mesh reinforce repair perform abdominal vaginal approach superior native tissue vaginal repair . This trial follow primary aim : 1 . To determine Apical Transvaginal Mesh non-inferior Sacral Colpopexy anatomic correction post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse time point 3 year . 2 . To determine Sacral Colpopexy superior Native Tissue Repair anatomic correction post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse time point 3 year . 3 . To determine Apical Transvaginal Mesh superior Native Tissue Repair anatomic correction post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse time point 3 year . Additional secondary aim include : 1 . Evaluate development valid reliable Global Composite Outcome balance adverse event patient-centered outcome anatomic definition failure success . 2 . Determine impact preoperative frailty mobility surgical treatment outcome postoperative complication old woman follow surgical correction apical pelvic organ prolapse . 3 . Evaluate patient 's perspective adverse event role patient decision-making outcome . The aim include compare patient versus surgeon ranking complication grade , outcome , expectedness seriousness , estimate association patient ranking adverse event ( AEs ) decision-making quality life outcome determine perspective AEs change time .</detailed_description>

Previous synthetic material biologic graft ( place vaginally abdominally ) augment POP repair include anterior , posterior and/or apical compartment 2 . Known previous formal SSLS perform either uterovaginal posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse * 3 . Known adverse reaction synthetic mesh biological graft ; complication include limited erosion , fistula , abscess 4 . Unresolved chronic pelvic painactive 5 . Prior abdominal pelvic radiation 6 . Contraindication index surgical procedure Known Horseshoe Kidney Pelvic Mass overlie sacrum Active diverticular abscess diverticulitis Shortened vaginal length ( &lt; 6 cm TVL ) NOTE : Only document SSLS exclusion . Mesh use midurethral sling NOT exclusion If prior POP repair unknown unable document , subject eligible base clinician judgment . The investigator examine ass evidence mesh graft evidence mesh graft present examination subject remain eligible .</criteria>
