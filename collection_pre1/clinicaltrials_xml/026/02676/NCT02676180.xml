	<detailed_description>Transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) urinary bladder responsible &gt; 12,000 new case cancer &gt; 5,000 death per year England Wales . Most bladder cancer non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) invade deeply presentation , 80 % tumour recur within 3 year . For muscle invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC ) , 5 year survival around 50 % . Cystoscopy standard test detection bladder cancer along image assess upper tract common present symptom haematuria . Cystoscopy invasive procedure result urinary infection 5 % case . Cystoscopy perform local anaesthetic patient require attend hospital clinic test . About one 10 patient investigated haematuria find bladder cancer . Frequently , patient refer investigation haematuria time first presentation delay diagnosis disease . The early detection bladder cancer mean non-invasive tumour marker test would impact management disease . There unmet need simple , non-invasive , highly sensitive specific method detect bladder cancer . This study determine accuracy UroMark high-throughput multiplex PCR test detect bladder cancer DNA urine . The study address unmet clinical need improve detection bladder cancer . The rationale trial base proof concept study provide compel evidence panel methylation marker apply detect bladder cancer high sensitivity specificity . It also possible collect store fraction urine assessment DNA relate biomarkers well non-DNA assay example cellular protein , soluble biomarkers urine supernatant RNA transcript sediment cell . In study compare UroMark assay establish assay include urinary cytology , FISH well develop assay MCM5 . In proposal excess urine store study .</detailed_description>
