	<brief_summary>Inadequate adherence antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) impede successful viral suppression consequently lead negative health consequence . This study aim refine test efficacy mobile health ART adherence application ( ARTAA ) , deliver smartphone , help individual improve ART adherence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobile Health Application Improve HIV Medication Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CDC estimate 1.1 million people live U.S. infected HIV [ 1 ] . Only quarter person live HIV ( PLWH ) successfully keep virus control [ 2 ] . Medication non-adherence significant contributor unsuccessful viral suppression ; recent meta-analysis find estimate 59 % participant North American study adherent commonly accept minimal threshold successful viral suppression [ 3 ] . While new antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) medication produce viral suppression low level adherence , relatively high adherence still necessary avoid disease progression shorten lifespan [ 4-6 ] . In addition , low level adherence increase risk infect others contribute development treatment resistant strain HIV [ 7 ; 8 ] . Interventions develop address significant public health problem present poor adherence , study demonstrate degree success short-term [ 9 ] . However , impact intervention generally sustain time [ 9 ] , HIV treatment setting resource deliver intensive intervention . As result , interest develop efficacious electronically-delivered intervention . Very little research focus establish efficacy mobile health application ART adherence . Further , publish study examine single session face-to-face intervention combine mobile application coach support reinforce sustain adherence . Delivered smartphone , portable application would allow real-time adherence track feedback ready access content service enhance adherence . The long-term goal line research disseminate efficacious , mobile health ART adherence application integrate readily clinical care . The objective application develop mobile health ART adherence application , pilot application , conduct preliminary randomize control trial application .</detailed_description>
