	<brief_title>A Therapeutic Open Label Study Tocilizumab Treatment Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH ) raise blood pressure lungs lead heart failure early death . Patients significantly reduce life expectancy , quality life severely affect . If leave untreated life expectancy 2-3 year . Current treatment aim relax vessel lung low blood pressure , however none target cause disease currently cure . Despite availability treatment impact mortality modest best one third patient still die within two year diagnosis . There remain urgent need test new way treat PAH . PAH often associate auto-immune disease ( body system attack rather fight infection ) . Targeting component immune system involve development disease offer potential new area treatment PAH ; example know involved progression PAH protein Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . Tocilizumab drug block action Interleukin-6 block Interleukin-6 show effective animal model PAH . Tocilizumab demonstrate safe effective trial disease associate PAH , rheumatoid arthritis . This study 6 month open label phase II trial IV Tocilizumab 21 patient group 1 PAH . The aim trial see Tocilizumab safe whether reduces blood pressure lung . Patients give Tocilizumab intravenously month six month close safety monitoring . The trial lead Papworth Hospital total 7 UK specialist centre take part . The trial ass safety drug response treatment measure heart function , blood pressure lung , exercise capacity quality life measurement .</detailed_description>
