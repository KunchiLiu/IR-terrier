	<brief_title>The ENRGISE Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growing evidence show low-grade chronic inflammation , characterize elevation plasma C-reactive protein , tumor necrosis factor alpha , particularly Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , independent risk factor disability , impaired mobility , low walk speed . Low-grade chronic inflammation modifiable risk factor . However , unknown whether intervention reduce level inflammatory marker per se improve mobility , avert decline mobility old person . To address gap evidence investigator conduct randomized clinical trial ENRGISE ( ENabling Reduction low-Grade Inflammation SEniors ) Pilot Study test ability anti-inflammatory intervention prevent major mobility disability improve preserve walk ability . We maximize public health impact select intervention safe , tolerable , acceptable , affordable vulnerable old person . Specifically , trial investigator test efficacy verus placebo angiotensin receptor blocker losartan omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid form fish oil , alone combination . Both angiotensin receptor blocker omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid show reduce IL-6 clinical trial preliminary data suggest may improve physical function . Recruitment include old person risk , , mobility impairment , measure slow gait speed self-reported mobility difficulty , elevated level IL-6 , marker consistently associate mobility limitation . Preliminary data regard feasibility need gather trial effectively design implement . We conduct The ENRGISE Pilot Study assess effect intervention several inflammatory marker , walk speed , physical function strength . This allow u refine design , recruitment yield , target population , adherence , retention , tolerability , sample-size , cost main ENRGISE trial .</detailed_description>
