	<detailed_description>This study retrospective PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) analysis paraffin-fixed sample participant chart review . The PCR analysis consist two phase ; PCR test validation phase azole resistance test phase . The investigator also perform retrospective chart review investigate association participant ' fungal clinical outcome presence azole resistance . I. PCR analysis 1 . PCR test validation phase - Validating PCR assay mock tissue Invasive fungal infection proven tissue ( microbiologically pathologically proven case ) . - The number validation sample 1000 ( 200 sample * five target PCR ) . - For enough validation PCR result , inter-laboratory comparison , especially core laboratory , perform verify PCR result test sample among laboratory standardize certain protocol molecular identification fungal infection clinical specimen . - Positive control ( human Î²-globin gene mouse actin gene ) negative control ( non-infected sample ) use validate PCR assay . Precision PCR set check use false discovery rate ( FDR ) acceptable level false positive among set significant result . If FDR &gt; 5 % , reject . - The intra-assay repeatability evaluate 10 replicates one DNA subsamples analyze single assay . The inter-assay reproducibility ass DNA subsample five separate time inter-sample reproducibility determine separate extraction four subsamples amplify single time . Statistical analysis carry use SAS software . 2 . Azole resistance test phase - The investigator perform PCR assay use participant biopsied paraffin embed tissue . Technical method PCR assay attach separately . - Around hundred biopsied sample impression fungal infection June 1st , 2009 June 31st , 2014 include PCR test . II . Retrospective chart review enrol participant . 1 . Data collection - All available participant ' electronic medical record data review collect demographic clinical information . 2 . Outcome measure - The investigator evaluate Invasive fungal infecrion treatment result , survival rate , prognosis accord existence azole resistance antifungal treatment modality include medication .</detailed_description>
