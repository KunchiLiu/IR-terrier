	<detailed_description>It know Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) cause cognitive impairment ( CI ) , estimate occur 40-65 % MS patient . The frequently observed impairment MS population process speed ( PS ) , well memory ( work episodic ) , verbal fluency , executive function selective attention also involve . Longitudinal study demonstrate slowly progressive , insidious course ; thus CI unlikely remit present . CI negative effect personal relationship self-esteem , lead social isolation . Also , decrease PS time predict decrease employment status MS patient . Thus , CI important , under-recognized consequence MS yet currently approve therapy treat common symptom . Amphetamines represent candidate class drug treat CI patient MS , base animal human study . Amphetamines standard care attentional/PS deficit attention deficit ( hyperactivity ) disorder ( ADHD ) multiple study demonstrate increase speed accuracy , well performance daily activity . Previous study MS population demonstrate mixed result , may due different formulation stimulant drug . This study 's lead PI recently complete pre-post dose study mixed amphetamine salt formulation extend release delivery system ( MAS-XR ) , trade name Adderall XR , MS population impair PS , compare improvement Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( SDMT ) result single dose MAS-XR ( 5 mg 10 mg ) placebo . We find 10 mg MAS-XR significantly improve performance SDMT , reliable measure PS MS population . MAS-XR 10 mg result increase SDMT 5.2 ( ± 4.5 ) point compare 0.6 ( ± 4.4 ) point placebo group ( p = 0.047 ) , result effect size 0.47 . However , pilot study , due single dose administration , unable determine benefit maintain time , examine increase subjective impression change effect daily living . Thus , although promising , previous pilot study MAS-XR unable determine increase note SDMT , objective measure PS , translate clinically meaningful impact person MS . The goal study evaluate efficacy safety 10 mg 20 mg MAS-XR PS memory measure MS patient multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled trial 12 week period across 5 site Canada . MAS-XR compose amphetamine sulfate salt 3:1 ratio l-isomers amphetamine , time reach maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) 7 hour . This study , addition objective measure cognitive function , also evaluate quality life ( QoL ) subjective measure cognitive function . We propose recruit 180 subject study , base sample size calculation potential 15 % drop , result approximately 150 subject complete full study . Subjects recruit London ( ON ) MS clinic MS cognitive clinic , lead site ; Sunnybrook MS clinic ( Toronto , ON ) ; Edmonton ( AB ) MS clinic ; Calgary ( AB ) MS clinic Dalhousie ( Halifax , NS ) MS clinic . Block randomization use . Subjects MS type demonstrating impaired PS SDMT , medical condition could explain impairment , eligible participation . Major depression , uncontrolled labile hypertension , history heart disease , diagnosis bipolar disorder result exclusion . Daily opioid use , benzodiazepine use , night , frequent marijuana use also result exclusion . The primary outcome SDMT , measure baseline , well six 12 week later . Secondary outcome include objective subjective measure . The objective cognitive measure memory Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised ( BVMTR ) California Verbal Learning Test 2nd edition ( CVLT2 ) , immediate recall ( IR ) measure . The subjective measure Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire ( MSNQ ) , Perceived Deficits Questionnaire ( PDQ ) , 36-Item Short Form Survey ( SF-36 ) , Modified Fatigue Impact Scale ( MFIS ) Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) measure different aspect QoL , administer baseline 12 week later . Adverse event , well heart rate blood pressure , investigate study visit . Overall , study address significant consequence MS , cognitive impairment , symptom devastate impact quality life ability MS patient fully participate community . Once present , CI unlikely remit , likely progress , currently prove treatment . The previous pilot study conduct lead PI MAS-XR demonstrate promise potential treatment process speed impairment MS patient . This study build previous pilot data , improve ability determine MAS-XR safe effective treatment CI MS population .</detailed_description>
