	<brief_title>EnBrace HR Depression Treatment Prevention Women Trying Conceive Early Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) occur twice often woman men , age onset coincides childbearing year . As 20 % reproductive-age woman experience episode depression , identify safe effective treatment depression , pregnancy become critical public health issue . Historically , pregnancy view protective time respect risk psychiatric illness , result lack prospective systematic investigation subject acute treatment prevention MDD woman plan conceive pregnancy . Contrary previous assumption , recent large-scale study demonstrate new onset recurrence depressive episode occur commonly pregnancy postpartum period . The current standard treatment recurrent major depression maintenance antidepressant ( AD ) therapy , due high risk recurrence among patient discontinue maintenance AD therapy . Although ADs frequently use pregnancy , concern remain regard spectrum adverse outcomes associate fetal exposure medication include : increase risk teratogenicity compromise obstetrical outcome variety negative neonatal clinical syndrome . Given concern , reproductive age woman treat AD frequently elect discontinue medication proximate pregnancy immediately become pregnant despite know increased risk relapse recurrence . With exception observational data demonstrate woman discontinue medication around time conception high risk recurrence , previous study available inform clinical treatment regard medication discontinuation plan pregnancy . This leave woman successfully treat ADs want become pregnant caught difficult clinical dilemma weigh risk fetal exposure medication potential impact untreated maternal depression pregnancy . Clinical decision make even complex fact study far definitive term compare risk utero exposure ADs risk untreated antenatal mood disorder . Given level uncertainty , many woman health care provider would welcome evidence-based non-psychotropic intervention alternative ADs order prevent recurrence euthymic woman history MDD plan pregnancy . However , potential efficacy non-psychotropic intervention population systematically investigate . There consistent grow evidence role various folate form prevention treatment depression . In fact , compel evidence treatment methylfolate agent would avoid potential risk antidepressant pregnancy , would also confer important benefit pregnancy child outcomes well , prevention major birth defect long term neurodevelopmental outcomes . To date , evidence base antidepressant effect folic acid , folinic acid , methylfolate , similar finding may attributable fact folate form share interconversion potential complex set pathway comprise one-carbon cycle . These reaction , turn depend B12 homocysteine availability , postulate exert antidepressant effect impact synthesis neurotransmitter norepinephrine , dopamine , serotonin . Some study suggest efficacy folate monotherapy MDD , intervention may limit common occurence polymorphisms general population make folate less efficient one-carbon cycle constituent L-methylfolate . Since certain polymorphism impair methylation process conversion folate active form , methylfolate , find overrepresented individual depression , methylfolate may effective form folate supplementation target MDD . Also , methylfolate may readily absorb brain compare folate form . Recently , Fava colleague demonstrate L-methylfolate significantly superior placebo treatment major depressive disorder patient fail respond AD therapy alone . In addition , several open blind study methylfolate monotherapy variety depress population find patient experienced significant improvement depressive symptom drug-related adverse event . Although control data need , initial study indicate methylfolate may safe effective option treatment depression , especially population vulnerable medication-related adverse event , folate deficient whose folate need elevate , case pregnant woman . EnBrace HR prescription prenatal/postnatal dietary management product contain vitamins mineral , include folic acid methylfolate . It meet criteria potential ideal candidate prevention depression pregnancy . It contain L-methylfolate folate derivative , optimal population high rate polymorphisms affect folic acid metabolism . It also contain omega-3 fatty acid , primarily eicosapentaenoic acid , show promise treatment depression . Importantly , component crucial healthy pregnancy . Folic acid supplementation associate reduce risk neural tube defect recommend use woman reproductive potential reduce risk birth defect , although substantial proportion population poor folic acid metabolizers . Methylfolate compound specifically may provide efficient delivery folate-related compound end . Very study examine treatment specifically assist patient discontinue ADs , none examine time proximate attempt conceive , pregnancy , particularly relevant due safety concern . The adaptation non-psychotropic treatment , EnBrace , use woman plan pregnancy pregnant choose discontinue maintenance AD treatment would broaden treatment choice available important time female life-cycle . Objective : The overarch goal investigation assess EnBrace treatment acute treatment prevention depression woman history major depressive disorder decide avoid discontinue maintenance AD treatment pregnancy . After complete protocol , plan use preliminary data development randomize control trial protocol . We include two group woman interested minimize medication exposure try conceive pregnancy : 1 ) woman histories depression depress , would like stop antidepressant pregnancy , 2 ) woman depressive episode pregnant try conceive ( antidepressant medication ) . Specific Aim 1a : To evaluate efficacy EnBrace use maintenance treatment MDD group woman ( N=10 ) try conceive early pregnancy decide stop ADs ( Group 1 ) . Relapse rate woman context demonstrated high , 68 % relapse rate large multisite NIMH-funded trial . Specific Aim 1b : To evaluate efficacy EnBrace use acute treatment MDD group woman ( N=10 ) try conceive early pregnancy ( Group 2 ) . Women major depressive episode group , may receive EnBrace monotherapy , adjunct current pharmacotherapy . Hypothesis 1a : We hypothesize relapse rate low woman receive EnBrace compare historical control . MDD relapse determine Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) mood module administer study clinician visit . Hypothesis 1b : We hypothesize majority woman receive EnBrace experience response ( 50 % improvement depressive symptom ) EnBrace therapy . Specific Aim 2 : To identify biological marker potential predictor response EnBrace . Hypothesis 2 : We hypothesize pre- post-treatment change homocysteine , folate , B12 , IL-6 CRP associate response EnBrace . We hypothesize specifically level folate B12 increase homocysteine decrease temporally treatment predictive prevention depressive episode . We hypothesize treatment low IL-6 CRP level due anti-inflammatory component EnBrace ( i.e. , omega-3 fatty acid ) decrease level inflammatory marker may predict low risk depressive relapse participant enter study depressive episode ( Group 1 ) , predict response treatment woman enter study depressive episode ( Group 2 ) . Specific Aim 3 ( Exploratory ) : To identify factor influence adherence tolerability treatment . This achieve use qualitative method explore ( ) perceive risks benefit treatment ; ( b ) perceive side effect profile ; ( c ) treatment convenience ; ( ) knowledge , attitude towards , preference depression treatment attempt conceive early pregnancy . Hypothesis 3 : We hypothesize EnBrace perceive patient 1 ) acceptable attractive treatment favorable risk/benefit profile context pregnancy try conceive , 2 ) well tolerate , 3 ) convenient easy adhere , 4 ) treatment woman try conceive pregnant find intuitive preferable prescription antidepressant medication ( woman antidepressant treatment Group 2 , prefer augmentation EnBrace rather increase antidepressant dose augmentation prescription psychotropic medication ) .</detailed_description>
