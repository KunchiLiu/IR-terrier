	<brief_summary>Compression stocking traditionally worn period time varicose vein surgery reduce pain bruising . The investigator provide ambulatory endovenous ablation service . Patients come Veins Unit , receive oral sedation , vein treat either laser radiofrequency ablation plus phlebectomies* local anaesthetic , recover hour go home . *Phlebectomy describes technique pull small varicose vein small incision overlie skin . The standard practice Veins Unit advise patient wear class two compression stocking four week post-operatively . Many patient would prefer short period time stocking . The Nice Guidelines Varicose Veins pose question : 'How long stocking wear endovenous ablation ? ' Three trial address issue : Bakker look patient wore stocking either two seven day laser ablation ; group wear stocking seven day fare well . Elderman look patient either wore stocking stocking two week laser ablation ; group wear stocking two week less pain . Krasznai look patient wore stocking either 4 hour 72 hour radiofrequency ablation ; significant difference post-op pain among group . None trial include patient phlebectomy time . This study aim answer question 'How long necessary wear compression stocking endovenous ablation ( either laser radiofrequency ) plus concomitant phlebectomy ? ' The investigator plan divide 110 patient two groups- either 'stockings 2 week ' ( trial group ) 'stockings 4 week ' ( usual treatment group ) . Pre-operatively , patient fill pain score two short quality life questionnaire , one specific varicose vein . Post-operatively home , patient ask keep diary pain analgesia use . They also document bruise seven day chart visual scale . At four week clinic review , patient ask fill pain bruising score , bruise chart two short quality life questionnaire . The group best pain , bruise quality life score post-operatively help guide duration compression therapy future patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Nice Guidelines Varicose Veins , publish NHS 2013 , question clinical benefit stocking endovenous ablation , benefit , long stocking wear . Three randomise control trial address issue : Bakker colleague randomise 69 patient two groups- stocking wear either two seven day laser ablation . The group wear stocking seven day well pain quality life score . Elderman colleague randomise 111 patient laser ablation two groups- group wear stocking , group wear stocking two week . The group wear stocking two week less pain required less analgesia . Krasznai colleague randomise 101 patient two groups- stocking wear either 4 hour 72 hour radiofrequency ablation ; significant difference post-op pain among group . None trial include patient phlebectomy time . This study hop answer question 'How long necessary wear compression stocking endovenous ablation ( either laser radiofrequency ) plus concomitant phlebectomy ? ' 110 consecutive patient randomise 'stockings 2 week ' ( trial group ) 'stockings 4 week ' ( usual treatment group ) . Randomisation facilitate online random number generation ( http : //www.random.org/ ) . Patients odd number allocate trial group ; randomly assign even number allocate usual treatment group . Pre-operatively , patient ask fill visual analog pain score ( VAS ) , Aberdeen Varicose Veins questionnaire RAND 36-Item Health Survey . Patients evaluate term CAEP stag Venous Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS ) supervise nurse physician . Endovenous laser therapy ( EVLT ) plus phlebectomy radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) plus phlebectomy perform standard manner . The trial group wear stocking 24 hour day first 4 day , day next 10 day . The usual treatment group wear stocking 24 hour day week , day next 3 week . Post-operatively home , patient ask keep diary pain analgesia use . They also document bruise 7 day diagram visual analog scale . At 4 week clinic review , VCSS complete patient ask fill visual analog pain bruise score , bruise diagram , Aberdeen Varicose Veins questionnaire RAND 36-Item Health Survey . Primary outcome measure post-operative pain score visual analog scale post-operative bruising score visual analog scale . Secondary outcome measure change veins-related quality life measure Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire change overall quality life base RAND 36-Item Health Survey .</detailed_description>
