	<brief_title>Desensitization Cross-Desensitization During Oral Grass Ragweed Pollen Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To induce clinical tolerance , failure respond allergen one previously responsive , important objective physician , one play significant role primary prevention allergic reaction clinical practice Allergy &amp; Immunology . The tolerance result standard subcutaneous immunotherapy aeroallergen insect venom allergen long lasting allergen-specific , may involve antigen-specific T regulatory cell . In contrast , tolerance result drug desensitization protocols short-lived , postulated target mast cell basophils . Research cellular biochemical process desensitization occur reveal mast cell desensitize one antigen vitro , certain condition , lose ability degranulate unrelated antigen direct FcÎµRI cross-linking . Preliminary data suggest cross-desensitization happen patient undergoing incremental desensitization , depend part percentage IgE target allergen use desensitization . This proposal therefore aim explore desensitization cross-desensitization human volunteer undergo standard sublingual ( SL ) immunotherapy grass ragweed pollen . Subjects undergo SL immunotherapy either Timothy Short Ragweed tablet , take one tablet per day , take placebo tablet . Titration skin test Timothy Short Ragweed , one preferably two additional allergen subject sensitive , codeine control mast cell activation capability non-IgE-dependent pathway perform determine PC3 value ( see ) . Skin testing , include histamine diluent control , perform prior one four week initiation immunotherapy . At time point , blood obtain measure total antigen-specific IgE level , tryptase cytokine level , basophil activation relevant allergens C5a non-IgE-mediated control basophil activation .</detailed_description>
