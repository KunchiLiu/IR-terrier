	<brief_summary>The investigator propose determine whether listen classical music sedation procedure decrease need procedural sedation medication . It two arm study compare music v music headphone investigator blind intervention . The outcome variable amount sedative use self-reported anxiety level report 10 point visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . The music intervention begin 1 minute prior sedation procedure continue subject completely awake . Demographics collect patient . No identifier collect . Data compare change VAS variable use non parametric method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives -The purpose study compare amount sedative ( ketamine , propofol , ketofol , benzodiazepine , narcotic , medication ) use procedural sedation patient undergoing fracture reduction emergency department , well amount anxiety measure State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , two group : patient listen classical music procedure versus patient listen music procedure . The investigator hypothesize patient listen classical music procedural sedation require low amount sedatives analgesia procedure report low level anxiety compare patient listen classical music . 2 . Background- Music use reduce anxiety experience pain medical procedure reduce requirement sedation particular procedure . One study look 100 patient undergoing interventional radiological procedure . After randomize participant 1:1 ratio , find sedation require 42 % patient music group compare 60 % patient control group . Also , mean dosage midazolam significantly less music group compare control group . This demonstrate significant reduction sedation requirement patient self-selected music play interventional radiological procedure . Music effectively make procedure safer reduce need sedation contribute experience patient . Procedural sedation use UNM Hospital ( UNMH ) Emergency Department ( ED ) regular basis help patient tolerate orthopedic reduction simple , close fracture without need go general anesthesia . This project design use music therapy attempt augment effect procedural sedation . Our investigation propose study whether music therapy adjunct sedation decrease amount sedative analgesic use orthopedic patient undergoing procedural sedation , whether patient report less anxiety music adjunct . Music therapy procedure show cost effective — reduce patient sedation , procedural time , number staff member necessary present procedure . Music therapy may also effective reduce anxiety patient undergo surgery regional anesthesia : In group 80 patient assigned experimental control group , anxiety significantly reduce experimental group listen music use headphone throughout surgery . According two systematic review , music therapy significantly improve pain score , satisfaction score , anxiety score , heart rate , arterial pressure . 3 . Study-Wide Number Subjects- Maximum target enrollment group 30 subject , total 60 subject project . 4 . Study Timelines- In experimental group , music start 1 minute prior conscious sedation continue patient 's sedation wear patient interactive investigator . The study take approximately 15 minute patient 's time , divide time procedure time procedure . The duration anticipate enroll study subject difficult anticipate , UNMH ED receive many one conscious sedation patient day one week . However , duration anticipate take less two year . Once data collection close , take researcher longer one year complete primary analysis . 5 . Study Endpoints -The study endpoint reach total 60 patient ( 30 experimental group 30 control group ) enrol . There primary secondary safety endpoint medical procedure drug involve study . 6 . Procedures Involved -Participants randomize intervention control group . The intervention listen classical song . In experimental group , music start 1 minute prior conscious sedation continue patient 's sedation wear patient interactive investigator . The music play use Apple™ IPOD player attach headphone . During hour study recruiter available , patient 18-65 year age present adult ED UNMH need orthopedic reduction procedural sedation invite participate . If patient agrees participate , research associate collect patient 's background information ( age , sex , type fracture , location fracture , etc . ) administer STAI scale . Subjects assign either control experimental group flip coin . Subjects undergo sedation reduction , research associate recording dose sedative analgesic use , time push . Once patient return baseline , research associate remove headphone administer STAI scale . Demographic information ( age , sex , type fracture , location fracture , etc . ) , STAI scale score , amount sedative analgesic administered procedure . Please see data collection form attachment comprehensive list . 7 . Provisions Monitor Data Ensure Safety Subjects- The investigator create Data Safety Monitoring Plan study study consider minimal risk investigational review board ( IRB ) . The plan consist monitor study adverse event incur subject ' participation study . Dr. Steven Weiss ( also Emergency Medicine ) head management team . Every 6 month investigator evaluate progress study , address adverse event create report finding . At yearly IRB renewal investigator include report progress report . The endpoint subject recruit study , anticipated take 18-24 month .</detailed_description>
