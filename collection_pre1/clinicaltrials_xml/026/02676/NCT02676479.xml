	<brief_summary>The study involve 30 pair male female sexually intimate partner carrier genetic disease ( e.g Sickle Cell Disease Thalassemia ) high risk transmit gene . The female partner superovulated mature multiple oocyte fertilize , inseminated partner 's sperm intra-uterine insemination ( IUI ) . Four six day IUI , female partner undergo non-surgical uterine lavage procedure recover preimplantation embryo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study prospective , single center , single-arm study evaluate healthy cell carry illness , collect perform histological genetic analysis blastocyst , endometrial tissue cell , form uterus , without burden morbidity mortality cause oocyte collection process , thereby subject iatrogenic intervention , uterine lavage . The study involve 30 pair male female sexually intimate partner carrier genetic disease ( e.g Sickle Cell Disease Thalassemia ) high risk transmit gene . The female partner superovulated mature multiple oocyte fertilize , inseminated partner 's sperm intra-uterine insemination ( IUI ) . Four six day IUI , female partner undergo non-surgical uterine lavage procedure recover preimplantation embryo . Following lavage , GnRH antagonist administer cause lysis multiple corpus lutea mitigate risk hyperstimulation use fertility medication reduce risk ectopic pregnancy lavage procedure recover preimplantation embryo . Recovered preimplantation embryo may screen aneuploidy genetic disease , cryopreserved potential future use subject Investigator separate purpose study . Each subject participate trial 10-20 week .</detailed_description>
