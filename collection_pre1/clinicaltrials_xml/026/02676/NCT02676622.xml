	<brief_summary>Crohn 's disease 'auto-immune ' disorder gut . In condition body 's immune system fight gut cause inflammation symptom . Patients refractory ( respond ) medication usually use control Crohn 's disease ( medicine like steroid , azathioprine , methotrexate , cyclophosphamide antibody like Infliximab ) , may consider part study . In study , investigator plan wipe ( ablate ) 'faulty immune system ' medicine ( immune-ablation ) give back patient stored stem cell ( collect ) - procedure call autologous ( self ) stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) . Once new immune system regrow stem cell , hop 'faulty ' immune cell return fight gut lead remission symptom Crohn 's disease . The aim treatment therefore , reset re-program immune system , fight patient 's body . Currently , trial experience procedure child young adult . There study show benefit ASCT procedure adult patient . In patient , benefit last 1-5 year ; 1 5 ( 20 % ) participant take medication Crohn 's disease even 5 year ASCT . Other 80 % need medication , case well disease control . In order potentially improve long term outcome ASCT , investigator add another medication ( addition use adult study ) call IL-2 ( Aldesleukin ) , give every-other-day injection skin ( subcutaneous ) low dose 6 week ASCT take home . Low dose IL-2 known increase type immune cell call T-regulatory cell ( Tregs ) make immune cell less reactive self . Study doctor believe increase population Tregs ASCT may lead good control Crohn 's disease- high percentage cure disease control long period time compare previous adult trial . Therefore , goal study are- 1 . To see ASCT use safely provide substantial benefit young adult refractory Crohn 's disease . 2 . To see addition IL-2 ASCT safe effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) immunologically mediate chronic illness relapse remit course , commonly present 2nd 3rd decade cause life long impairment health quality life . Mainstay clinical treatment severe disease combination anti-inflammatory agent like 5-aminosalicyaltes immunosuppressive medication like corticosteroid new anti-TNF antibody like Infliximab . None drug , present , curative relevant subset patient refractory many pharmacologic approach . Immunoablative treatment follow autologous stem cell rescue ( Autologous HSCT ) try refractory group patient successful result . Autologous HSCT work auto-immune set eradication effector/memory T-cell clone due direct immuno-ablative effect drug use preparative regimen ; lead immune-reset- recover clone T- cell infused stem cell mount auto-immune response tolerant 'self ' antigen , upregulation T regulatory cell ( Treg , CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ CD8+ FOXP3+ ) via change cytokine mileu transplant . Increased population Tregs restrict activity self reactive effector T-cells . This pilot study design gain success previously publish adult study autologous HSCT refractory CD , aim confirm feasibility , safety efficacy HSCT ultra low dose IL-2 give post-HSCT pediatric patient young adult . IL-2 low dos show increase proliferation Treg lymphocytes decrease inflammatory response . Hence , use IL-2 post-transplant result significant persistent increase Treg population may lead durable remission immunoablative therapy . This pilot focus 'safety ' treatment pediatric population.Since , combination immuno-ablative therapy follow ultra low dose IL-2 study child CD , therefore transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) severe toxicity ( &gt; grade 3 toxicity NCI criterion ) monitor 100 day post-transplant patient stop rule enforce case excessive toxicity TRM ( &gt; 10 % ) . Correlative study perform specific time point assess cytokine inflammatory marker , immune-reconstitution quantitative Treg cell ; clinical assessment do 1 year post-HSCT disease activity , steroid free remission period evaluate 'clinical efficacy ' procedure . The major aim pilot generate preliminary safety cytokine profile data confirm feasibility benefit autologous HSCT IL-2 child young adult refractory CD .</detailed_description>
