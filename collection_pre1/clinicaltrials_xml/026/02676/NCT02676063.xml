	<brief_summary>The primary objective evaluate neonatal characteristic , biological clinical investigation predictive factor death , severe moderate neurodevelopmental disability 3 year , large population-based cohort full-term late preterm neonate moderate severe HIE . Contrary previous study often analyze accuracy one factor among clinical investigation , investigator objective 's seek relevant combination several factor among follow list : - Neonatal characteristic : gestational age birthweight , maternal disease , acute intrapartum event , delivery mode , acidosis , neurological examination , place birth neonatal transfer - Laboratory investigation : pH , lactate new biological marker detail - Clinical investigation : aEEG , EEG , MRI , diffusion-weighted MRI</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Prognostic Neonatal Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy With Hypothermia Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) rare neonatal condition affect 1â€° birth high rate death severe neurological disability despite significant improvement management illness last ten year . During first hour day life , different examination make neonatologists guide decision management HIE provide information family . Nevertheless , good knowledge early late predictive factor long-term severe moderate neurodevelopmental outcome badly need . This study prospective national observational population-based study involve level III intensive care unit France . This population-based cohort study perform include moderate severe case HIE , occur 34 42 complete week gestation newborns admit neonatal intensive care unit participate French region . Children followed-up age 3 year . Participating center invite adhere current HIE management guideline and/or clinical investigation consider optimal date , ensure standardize clinical practice . The study ensure high quality data collection . About indication , time characteristic treatment investigation elaborate scientific committee preparation stage cohort study . This professional advice double advantage enable u record homogeneous high-quality data , standardize improve clinical management investigation among newborns HIE . Within main study , ancillary study perform 21 center address first secondary objective ( predictive value early - first 6 hour life - neurological examination biological investigation , include specific new biomarkers Interleukin-6 , Metalloproteinase-9 , TIMP-1 , Albumin modify hypoxia , troponin I , acylcarnitins amino acid ) .</detailed_description>
