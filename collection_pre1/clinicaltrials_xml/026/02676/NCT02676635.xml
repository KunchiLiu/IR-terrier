	<detailed_description>A . Rationale Masons high rate overexertion injury among construction trade rank second occupation back injury United States . Identified ergonomic solution primary method reduce exposure risk factor associate musculoskeletal disorder . However , many construction worker lack knowledge solution , well basic ergonomic principle . Construction apprentice great need ergonomics train embark career minimize cumulative exposure lead musculoskeletal disorder . Additionally , apprenticeship training program often lack `` soft skill '' train appropriately respond work environment practice unsafe . The SAVE program - SAfety Voice Ergonomics - strives integrate evidence-based health safety training strategy current masonry apprenticeship skills train teach ergonomics , problem solving , speak reduce musculoskeletal injury risk . SAVE incorporate blend learning principle combine traditional , face-to-face teach method e-learning method . B . Objectives The primary objective project evaluate SAVE program cluster randomize controlled trial 12-15 masonry training center . Clusters apprentice within center assign random one four intervention group ( n = 32 per group ) : ( 1 ) ergonomics training , ( 2 ) combine ergonomics safety voice training , ( 3 ) control group additional training intervention . Outcomes assessed baseline , conclusion training , 6 12 month post train include : musculoskeletal symptom , general health perception , knowledge ergonomic safety voice principle , perception attitude ergonomic safety voice issue . The central hypothesis combination ergonomics train safety voice promotion effective training either ergonomics train alone safety voice train alone . C. Procedures Primary Training Program E-learning Modules . Depending group training center assign , apprentice within center view brief e-learning training module provide apprentice basic knowledge ergonomic and/or safety voice principle . These module include text , brief video clip , interactive on-screen slide guide apprentice content brief quizzes assure understanding . Apprentices complete module apprenticeship train center . Learning gain complete e-learning module reinforce short ( 10-20 minute ) , apply , face-to-face experiential activity . These interactive , face-to-face , problem-solving activity complement e-learning include vignette promote discussion hypothetical worksite case related ergonomics and/or safety voice . These vignette brief fit exist training time demand . Secondary ( Refresher ) Training Program Refresher train ergonomics and/or safety voice bolster concept learn apprentice primary training . Depending group training center assign , apprentice within center receive refresher training text message send researcher . Secondary training consider medium engagement learn since apprentice respond text . For example , ergonomic-related text message would read , `` Keeping work knee shoulder level reduces risk back shoulder injury . During past week work adjustable scaffolding ? '' The apprentice respond `` Yes '' `` No . '' Apprentices respond `` Yes '' receive follow-up text/email remind importance keep work knee shoulder level . Refresher train delivered one-year period maximize knowledge retention .</detailed_description>
