	<detailed_description>This developmental research grant award ( R21 ) request fund explore feasibility impact public health system PrEP intervention recently emerge HIV epidemic Athens Greece . As HIV epidemic setting globally plateaued decline , emerge epidemic , re-emerging epidemic outbreaks become common , particularly social , political `` shock '' impact HIV prevention resource occur . One well characterized example recent epidemic among people inject drug ( PWID ) start Athens follow austerity measure 2010 . While success limit epidemic within PWID observe , recent phylogenetic surveillance analysis demonstrate HIV strain recent PWID epidemic ( CRF35_AD , CRF14_BG , subtypes A B ) spill MSM 2013 ( see Preliminary Studies ) . In emerge epidemic , oral chemoprophylaxis commonly-used public health strategy prevent infectious disease susceptible person . For example , among US European MSM , antibiotic prophylaxis sex-partners outbreak invasive meningococcal disease limit emerge outbreak . Similarly , pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) potential use emerge epidemic prevent onwards HIV transmission . While approach would seem intuitive , current conceptualization PrEP implementation narrowly use clinical model focus individualize intervention health provider client . This problematic public health impact PrEP may limit due lack proper targeting . In fact , evidence `` real-world '' PrEP use suggest low risk client access PrEP . As compare resource intensive clinical trial demonstration study , careful modeling approach provide insight within new HIV epidemic target PrEP prevent onward transmission well strategy use identify individual link care . The investigator propose model approach use Agent Based Model ( ABM ) move beyond basic pathogen transmission pattern deal complex social interaction , include overlap social sexual network well implementation reality , like finite PrEP resource , delay linkage PrEP care early PreP care retention base upon empirically collect data Athens Greece . Specifically investigator aim : 1 ) Characterize bridge MSM network ( n=250 ) measure individual-level risk factor , network-level connection , HIV phylogenetic cluster ; 2 ) Measure early PrEP cascade outcome ( HIV testing , PrEP linkage care ) sub-sample ( n=50 ) HIV uninfected MSM short term ; 3 ) Model effect target public health PrEP intervention HIV transmission Athens . Agent-based model account empirical network structure state-of-the-art modeling HIV transmission flexible enough address fundamental question receive PrEP ultimately network-PrEP intervention impact emerging/reemerging HIV epidemic .</detailed_description>
