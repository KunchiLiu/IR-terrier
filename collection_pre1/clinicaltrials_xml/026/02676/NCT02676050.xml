	<brief_summary>Lung cancer currently major health problem UK . Despite one common cancer , lung cancer poor prognosis compare type cancer lead cause cancer death world . As opposed organ , lung highly susceptible inflammatory insult , example bacterial infection-induced tobacco-induced inflammation . It long know cellular microenvironment nurture tumour growth development link site chronic inflammation molecular insight external inflammation boost inhibits cancer lung remain unclear . This study aim directly visualise expression well know marker cancerous tissue , c-MET , activity neutrophil human lung cancer vivo situ use fibre-based endomicroscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visualising c-MET Activated Neutrophils Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study directly deliver microdose two optical image agent 20 patient suspect confirmed lung cancer ass whether agent detect c-MET expression neutrophil activity human lung cancer . The primary endpoint visualise delivery image agent assess image parameter patient suspect diagnosed lung cancer use novel delivery catheter , image fibre fibre-based endomicroscopy system . This protocol involve two cohort patient ; Cohort 1 include patient schedule resection lung cancer Cohort 2 patient suspect inoperable stage 3/4 lung cancer schedule diagnostic bronchoscopy follow therapy . For cohort , eligibility verify clinical trial physician write informed consent obtain . Fibre-based endomicroscopy ( FE ) perform 100μg optical image agent instilled bronchoscopy procedure . CT identify region architecturally normal lung participant act internal control use compare signal normal diseased lung tissue . Tissue sample take cohort collect ex vivo validation include immunohistochemistry , zymography genomic screening . A cardiorespiratory exam , chest x ray routine observation perform 4-6 hour follow administration image agent . All participant visit member research team 24 hour ( ± 4 hour ) dose ensure adverse event experience . All participant Cohort 1 complete study 24 hour assessment successfully complete adverse event resolve . Participants Cohort 2 invite back second bronchoscopy follow first round therapy investigate whether expression c-MET level neutrophil activity change . All participant Cohort 2 complete study second 24 hour assessment successfully complete adverse event resolve .</detailed_description>
