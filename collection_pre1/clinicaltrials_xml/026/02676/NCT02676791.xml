	<brief_title>Influence Esophageal Washout Local Carcinoma Recurrence After Curative Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma esophagus change rapidly last decade due implementation multimodal cancer therapy radiotherapy combine radiochemotherapy . Surgery , however , still mainstay curative treatment option cancer entity . Due significant improvement surgical technique perioperative management , postoperative mortality rate fall 5 % estimate 5-year survival 35 % . Nevertheless , patient esophagectomy high risk local recurrence especially within first 2 year treatment . Independent risk factor development carcinoma recurrence incomplete resection ( R1 ) , extracapsular lymph node involvement postoperative complication . Exfoliated , malignant cell remain luminal organ like esophagus colorectum could present another important risk factor local recurrence especially site anastomosis . In treatment rectal cancer , data show , intraoperative rectal washout significantly reduce risk local recurrence 10 % 5 % . For reason , rectal washout anterior resection become standard many surgical institution . Besides agent like cetrimide , sodium hypochlorite , formalin saline , povidone-iodine also use rectal mucosal application prospective study . Questions arise , weather similar positive outcome could achieve esophageal surgery . The investigator hypothesize esophageal washout povidone-iodine solution ( BetaisodonaÂ® , Mundipharma ) reduce risk local carcinoma recurrence radical resection .</detailed_description>
