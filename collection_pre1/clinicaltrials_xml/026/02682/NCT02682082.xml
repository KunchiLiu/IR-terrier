	<brief_title>EUS Guided Neurolysis Celiac Block w/wo Bupivacaine Patient Being Treated Palliatively Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic malignancy second high incident gastrointestinal malignancy Canada . From cancer mortality statistic 2014 , 4,700 new case pancreatic malignancy second colorectal cancer , represent 2.4 % cancer . Even chemotherapy , median survival patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma 6 10 month . Few patient diagnose resectable stage ( 12 % -20 % ) many patient candidate palliation only.In context , one important symptom pain often affect quality life survival.70 80 % patient Pancreatic cancer abdominal pain time diagnosis . Adequate pain control therefore essential component care patient . In initial phase , pain visceral , disease progression , somatic pain may occur , especially due peripancreatic invasion neural structure muscle . Standard analgesic Acetaminophen ineffective administration opioids frequently limited side effect nausea , constipation , somnolence , addiction , confusion respiratory depression , failure achieve adequate analgesia . In situation , neurodestructive method celiac plexus Absolute Alcohol associate Bupivacaine involve main pancreatic pain pathway , seem efficient . Alcohol cause immediate precipitation endoneural lipoprotein mucoproteins within celiac plexus , lead extraction cholesterol phospholipids neural membrane . To prevent severe transient pain procedure , Bupivacaine inject Alcohol injection . Interest importance EUS-CPN well establish ( safe , effective percutaneous CT guide celiac plexus Neurolysis , significant reduction pain significant reduction narcotic requirement ) however role effect Bupivacaine effectiveness Neurolysis lytic power Alcohol never study . Is synergistic effect ? Or antagonistic effect dilute Alcohol ? The Centre hospitalier de l'université de Montréal ( CHUM ) currently busy EUS center world large experience EUS-guided CPN . The CHUM also probably see pancreatic cancer annually center ( 300 proven cases/year ) . There publish report serious adverse event associated procedure investigator experience well . Patients may however experience mild moderate discomfort initial injection absolute ethanol solution , usually short live ( less 30 minute experience ) . Therefore , Bupivacaine currently inject Ethanol injection , however , local anesthetic use Phenol injection example report Phenol immediate local anesthetic effect . The investigator believe , Bupivacaine effect instead dilute alcohol reduces lytic power Ethanol . This study design test hypothesis prospectively . The goal project determine EUS-CPN without Bupivacaine ( versus EUS-CPN Bupivacaine ) reduce pain score improve quality life patient inoperable pancreatic cancer reduce morbidity due narcotic side effect ( e.g . nausea , excessive sedation , constipation ) .</detailed_description>
