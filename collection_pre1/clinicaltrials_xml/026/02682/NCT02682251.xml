	<detailed_description>An interventional study empower congestive heart failure patient cardiac resynchronization therapy-cardiac implantable electronic device ( CRT-CIED ) use personal health record ( PHR ) directly message device data send alert base percent leave ventricular pacing . There three phase study . In first phase investigator employ user-centered design approach well understand type information patient remotely monitor CRT-CIED would find beneficial towards understand manage disease . The investigator also hope uncover expectation alert mechanisms two-way messaging provider patient around CIED remote monitor data . In second phase investigator implement PHR intervention design phase 1 . In third phase study , investigator test PHR intervention single arm , 6-month trial . A maximum 120 participant ( include patient caregiver , partner , and/or support person ) enrol focus group phase 1 . A maximum 10 patient enrolled design session follow phase 1 . After build intervention phase 2 , maximum 30 patient enrol technology trial phase 3 . Enrollment project complete within six month phase 1 , within one year phase 3 . In phase 3 , adult subject ( N=30 ) diagnosis congestive heart failure undergo chronic resynchronization therapy CIED receive interventional messaging PHR regard percent leave ventricular pacing . The study duration commence time inform consent documentation first focus group conclude time last patient visit technology trial . Impact PHR message evaluated timeliness patient call clinic adjustment therapy , improve percentage LV pace 6 month compare historical control clinic , well self-reported patient engagement . Timeliness patient call clinic evaluate record patient call clinic 6 month prior study 6 month study . Patient engagement evaluate patient survey start end study . Patients follow standard care + intervention study .</detailed_description>
