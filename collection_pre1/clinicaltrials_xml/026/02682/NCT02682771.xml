	<brief_summary>Obesity , due excess fat thoracoabdominal region , promote change respiratory function lung function , lead reduction lung volume capacity . Such dysfunction worsen bariatric surgery associate factor inherent procedure . The objective study evaluate compare effect application bilevel positive airway pressure exercise inspiratory pressure linear load thoracoabdominal mobility , pulmonary function , inspiratory muscle strength , respiratory muscle strength prevalence pulmonary complication bariatric surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positive Airway Pressure Versus Breathing Exercises With Load Inspiratory Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial , randomize , blind , 60 volunteer , evaluation preoperatively , consist : cirtometry measure thoracoabdominal mobility , spirometry measure lung function , nasal inspiratory pressure inspiratory muscle strength endurance incremental test evaluation respiratory muscle strength , randomize allocate three group , 20 volunteer . The intervention perform immediate postoperative period first day surgery . The first group , call control group receive care Conventional Respiratory Physiotherapy ( CRP ) , consist breathing exercise , incentive spirometer ambulation . The second group , call Positive Pressure Group receive two-level positive airway pressure one hour , addition CRP . The third group , call Load Inspiratory Group hold exercise inspiratory pressure linear load , link also CRP . Treatments applied twice immediate postoperative period shortly return ward 4 hour initial treatment three time day first day surgery . On discharge , second day surgery , volunteer perform chest x-ray underwent evaluation perform preoperatively .</detailed_description>
