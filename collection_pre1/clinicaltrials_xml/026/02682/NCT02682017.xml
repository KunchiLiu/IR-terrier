	<brief_summary>Red meat make significant contribution human diet . The widely consume meat globally pork account 36 % overall meat intake beef poultry contribute 22 % 35 % , respectively . Pork meat provide range important nutrient include protein , zinc , B-vitamins range important mineral however accumulate evidence suggest consuming red meat process meat increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) colon cancer . Despite report negative impact health , global pork consumption continue increase increase effort improve nutritional profile pork meat development novel porcine feed regimen . The manipulation pig feed produce 'healthier ' meat meat product offer feasible approach reduce risk preventable disease . Furthermore , recent projection increase global demand pork poultry , particularly China , highlight increase strain place supply grain need find alternative sustainable feed ingredient . Macroalgae emerge potential sustainable source novel bioactive ingredient animal feed industry specie know good source protein , mineral , polyunsaturated fatty acid range fibre component include fucoidan laminarin . The polysaccharide , laminarin fucoidan , find abundance brown seaweed , gain increase attention potential bioactive feed ingredient putative antioxidant , anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory activity . Incorporation laminarin/fucioidan mix ( LAM/FUC ) porcine diet show result lower level lipid oxidation fresh pork steak . Numerous study date also investigate health promote effect LAM/FUC modulation porcine gut microbiota show enhance inflammatory cytokine expression response pathogen recognition also increase piglet performance post weaning . The uptake fate fucoidan human remain unknown albeit consumption , unaltered fucoidan detect human plasma ingestion suggest least partial bioavailability compound . A study Moroney et al . ( 2015 ) use vitro bioavailability Caco-2 model provide indication fucoidan bioavailable may potent antioxidant potential . The primary aim randomise parallel placebo control human intervention trial investigate consume pork meat pig supplement LAM/FUC mix , addition normal diet , would impact blood oxidant inflammatory status healthy adult . The secondary aim determine effect consume LAM/FUC fed pork meat lymphocyte DNA damage , lipid status immune function healthy adult .</brief_summary>
