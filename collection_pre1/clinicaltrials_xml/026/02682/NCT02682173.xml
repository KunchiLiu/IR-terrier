	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Fat Quantification Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , liver biopsy still regard gold-standard diagnosis non-alcoholic fatty liver disease monitoring progression . However , accuracy diagnosis perfect certain risk sample error depend biopsy quality less homogeneous distribution liver tissue alteration . Complications rare ; however , method invasive carry risk bleeding . Therefore , non-invasive method ( serum biomarkers image technique ) seek accurate diagnosis safe monitoring disease progression . Unidimensional transient elastography ( TE ; FibroScanÂ® ) non-invasive technique , helpful tool : however , accuracy diagnosis depend stage fibrosis low grade fibrosis ( stage 1 2 ) difficult ass . Moreover , obese patient method apply . In recent year , development fat-water magnetic resonance image enable non-invasive assessment fat water content tissue . In addition , modern MRI device allow brief breath holding , reduce motion artifact provide u excellent data therefore MRI become important tool fat quantification . Up date study focus fat quantification bariatric surgery : patient treat laparoscopic gastric banding ( purely restrictive procedure ) patient undergo metabolic surgery sleeve gastrectomy gastric bypass examine pre- postoperatively mean MRI fat quantification . However , study single voxel spectroscopy use . In contrast , current trial investigator aim assess full organ volume , hopefully provide accurate data .</detailed_description>
