	<brief_summary>Over one million individual United States meet criterion cocaine use disorder . Relapse rate high among cocaine-dependent ( CD ) population . Social stress significant risk factor relapse . Data human neuroimaging study suggest `` top-down '' prefrontal cortical inhibition amygdala activity control emotional response social stimulus . A grow literature suggest hypoactivity medial prefrontal cortex couple increase amygdala activity underscore vulnerability CD individual relapse . Neuroimaging study corticolimbic network activity ( functional connectivity ) conduct CD subject rest . Compared healthy control , CD subject exhibit low corticolimbic connectivity degree corticolimbic uncouple associated time relapse . Studies measure corticolimbic connectivity exposure social stress task CD subject could provide critical insight neurobiologic mechanism underscore sensitivity CD individual social stress . Moreover intervention improve corticolimbic connectivity CD subject may effective therapeutic strategy prevent relapse CD population . Oxytocin ( OT ) anxiolytic neuropeptide attenuate amygdala response aversive social cue . In order well understand neurobiologic mechanism control emotion-related behavior CD population , propose double-blind placebo ( PBO ) control study use blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) measure ( 1 ) corticolimbic functional connectivity Montreal Imaging Stress Task ( MIST ) ( 2 ) amygdala activity response implicit facial affect recognition paradigm group CD individual ( CD n=80 ) healthy non-dependent control ( HC , n=80 ) . Prior scan session , participant receive either intranasal OT ( 24 IU ) PBO spray ( n=40 per treatment group ) . The order task counterbalance .</brief_summary>

Interpersonal Support Evaluation List Short Form ( ISEL-SF ) : The ISEL-SF 12-item self-report form measure perceive availability four domains social support ( belong , self-esteem , appraisal tangible ) . Individuals rate item use four-point scale range definitely false ( 1 ) definitely true ( 4 ) . Participants ask complete ISEL-SF assessment visit . Urine Pregnancy Test : Female participant ask provide urine sample test presence human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) use QuickVue One-Step urine hCG pregnancy test ( Quidel Corporation , San Diego , CA ) . The test provide qualitative measure hCG urine ( ≥ 25 milli-Intenational unit ( mIU/mL ) ; 99 % sensitivity ; 99 % specificity ) . The urine pregnancy test perform screen day study visit , prior urine drug screen breathalyzer test . If pregnancy test positive , subject exclude test take place . Blood Sample Collection Assays : Baseline saliva sample estradiol , progesterone baseline blood sample OT collect participant 15-30 minute prior OT/PBO administration . Blood collect tube contain ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) . Tubes centrifuge 1500 rpm 4˚C . Plasma store −70˚C . Determination OT perform use commercial ELISA kit ( Enzo Life Sciences ) . Intra-assay coefficient variation OT average ~3-5 % inter-assay variation typically less 10 % . Substance Related Instruments Form 90 : The Form 90 , assessment instrument commonly use addiction study , similar concept Time Line Follow back . This calendar-based instrument design assess daily substance consumption . Study participant ask estimate amount substance consume aid visual cue design accurately quantify consumption . Cocaine record dollar value well quantity order standardize different type cocaine use ( crack , IV , nasal , etc. ) . The data summarize three way : ( ) percent abstinent day ( i.e. , use ) ; ( b ) amount use per day ( c ) day since last use . Urine Drug Screening : Drug screen perform use On Track Test Cup ( Roche Diagnostics ) , vitro diagnostic test qualitative detection drug drug metabolite urine . The On Track Test Cup profile ( cut ) consist amphetamine ( 1000ng/ml ) , cocaine ( 300 ng/ml ) , tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) ( 50 ng/ml ) , morphine ( 300 ng/ml ) , benzodiazepine ( 200 ng/ml ) . Results use ascertain abstinence prior initiation test session substantiate self-report . Breathalyzer : To ascertain abstinence alcohol study period , subject breath sample presence alcohol ( Alco-Sensor III , Intoximeters Inc. , St. Louis , MO ) . The Alco-Sensor III accurately detect breath alcohol level .000-.400 blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) . Session Procedures Study Visit : Participants instruct arrive MUSC 's Addiction Sciences Division ( ASD ) morning study visit . Participants inform expect remain abstinent cocaine drug three-day period prior study visit order minimize impact recent drug/alcohol use brain activity subjective response MIST . Participants ask avoid caffeinated beverage morning study visit since caffeine may introduce variability stress reactivity . If participant nicotine-dependent ( ) provide nicotine patch . Upon arrive ASD , participant breathalyze provide urine sample , test presence cocaine , opiates , barbiturate , benzodiazepine , stimulant ; female , urine pregnancy test also administer prior drug test . If pregnancy urine drug test negative , exception marijuana , session proceed . In event participant test positive drug alcohol , study visit reschedule . Saliva sample collect , participant escort Clinical Neurobiology Laboratory Institute Psychiatry blood draw . Participants escort on-campus Center Biomedical Imaging ( CBI ) facility approve study personnel . Medication Administration Intranasal OT match PBO ( saline spray ) compound MUSC 's Investigational Drug Services ( IDS ) extensive experience extemporaneous OT preparation quality control monitoring . Randomization do IDS , keep record blind . The record available unblinding require . To achieve balance sample size respect gender , smoke status , age , race , block randomize design randomly vary block size use . OT PBO spray administer CBI supervision study staff 11:30 a.m. , approximately 45-minutes prior scanning session . First participant ask blow nose . The vial prim ensure puff contains OT placebo spray air . The participant instruct exhale nose spray one nostril inhaling . Nostrils alternate participant ask repeat procedure nostril . Participants self-administer three puff nasal spray per nostril ( 4 IU OT/puff ) total 24 IU . This dose timing administration select base similar fMRI study demonstrate BOLD signal change amygdala 45-50 minute post-administration . MRI Data Acquisition All MRI data acquire Siemens Trio 3 Tesla ( T ) scanner ( Siemens Medical , Erlangen , Germany ) . Participants screen metal use handheld metal detector . Study personnel position subject scanner bed foam padding place around head prevent motion . Participants wear earplugs/headphones task project wide screen locate end scanner bore view via back-projected mirror mount 12-channel head coil . Participants use non-ferrous optical hand pad submit answer arithmetic task . The hand pad connect via optical cable computer outside scanner room . Their ability view projection screen use hand pad assess prior scan . During initial scanner tuning , localizing , structural scanning , participant show `` relax '' image ( i.e. , 20 scenic picture , display 30 second ) . A high resolution T1-weighted MPRAGE anatomical scan ( TR = 8.1 m , echo time ( TE ) ( TE = 3.7 m , flip angle = 8° , field view = 256 mm , 1.0 mm ) cover entire brain position use sagittal scout image acquire co-registration normalization functional image . T2*-weighted gradient echo planar imaging ( EPI ) image acquire follow parameter : TR = 2500 m , TE = 27 m , flip angle = 77º , 40 axial slice ( FOV = 224 x 224 mm , thickness = 3.5 mm voxels 0.5 mm gap , interleave order . The scan plane orient parallel anterior commissure-posterior commissure line . Implicit Facial Affect Recognition Task The amygdala response emotional face present outside focus attention ( i.e . implicit task ) significantly great observe overt ( explicit ) presentation stimulus . Emotional adult face select variety source standardize size enclose oval surround . Dr. Joseph ( Co-I ) develop corpus face recent project , `` A comparative developmental connectivity study face processing '' ) use present project . The face depict male female Caucasian , Asian African Americans express three different category emotion ; fear , anger , happiness . Neutral face also present . Because participant also different ethnic category , important include mixture race . In block design , participant view series face ( 27.5 sec ) within block report gender face end block ( 5 sec ) . Each block present 56 face depict emotion gender 6 pseudorandomly order task block ( 3 emotion x 2 gender ) 7 rest block ( 27.5 sec ) present crossbar fixate . In task block , emotional face present 33 msec . follow neutral face mask ( different individual ) 167 msec . follow blank screen 291 msec . At end block participant report gender use two button response pad . Assignment face set session counterbalance across subject . The Montreal Imaging Stress Task The study use block design three , six-minute run separate two-minutes rest feedback , total 24-minutes . During run , participant expose 40-second block three different condition ( rest , control , stress ) . Prior task , research assistant meet participant describe parameter task . The participant show image screen look like condition . The participant instruct relax rest condition focus screen . During control condition , participant ask answer math problem accurately possible also tell response record . During stress condition , participant ask perform math task quickly accurately possible . They give immediate feedback performance able see performance level `` average '' person performance bar locate top screen . A strict time limit enforce throughout stress condition . The participant tell average person would answer 85 % question correctly , reality , program 's algorithm limit participant ' performance rate 35-45 % . At end run one two , participant give negative feedback investigator urge improve performance data may include study . To minimize effect scanner drift , begin condition counterbalance participant . However , sequence condition constant ( i.e . control condition follow rest condition stress condition follow control condition ) .</detailed_description>
