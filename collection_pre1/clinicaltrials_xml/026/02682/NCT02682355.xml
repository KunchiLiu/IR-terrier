	<brief_summary>Polymyxin B already use extensively USA part world ; use likely rapidly increase due great burden infection cause MDR Gram-negative bacteria grow awareness limitation inherent clinical pharmacology CMS/colistin . Cross resistance exist two polymyxin thus must dose optimally ; recently generate scientifically-based dosage regimens CMS/colistin extrapolate polymyxin B . It essential adequately power study conduct define clinical PK/PD/TD relationship polymyxin B identify , use next-generation proteomics , biomarkers early detection kidney injury . This allow development scientifically-based dosage regimens various category patient adaptive feedback control clinical tool optimize dose polymyxin B future individual patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Clinical Use Polymyxin B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) Gram-negative 'superbugs ' rapidly spread around world , polymyxin B colistin ( polymyxin E ) often effective antibiotic . Since polymyxin B release 1950s , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , toxicodynamics ( PK/PD/TD ) never define . Recent pharmacological research polymyxins predominantly focus colistin methanesulfonate ( CMS , inactive prodrug colistin ) demonstrate CMS significant limitation . Thus , polymyxin B increasingly view preferred polymyxin . Unfortunately , recently develop scientifically-based dosing recommendation CMS apply polymyxin B , latter administer active entity . Therefore , essential determine PK/PD/TD polymyxin B critically-ill patient , refine optimal dosage regimen , develop user-friendly adaptive feedback control ( AFC ) clinical tool . The Specific Aims : 1 . To develop population PK model polymyxin B ; 2 . To investigate relationship PK polymyxin B , duration therapy patient characteristic , development timing nephrotoxicity ; use next-generation proteomics identify predictive biomarker ( ) polymyxin B associate nephrotoxicity ; develop population PK/TD model ; 3 . To establish relationship polymyxin B PK , bacterial susceptibility patient characteristic , probability attain time achieve clinical bacteriological outcome ; 4 . To employ model Aims 1-3 Monte Carlo simulation develop scientifically-based dosage regimens polymyxin B develop AFC algorithm future individual patient . Research Design : Patients treat intravenous polymyxin B identify three clinical site USA one Singapore . Patients ( n = 250 ) blood collect various time surround dose polymyxin B day 1 5 therapy . Development nephrotoxicity , clinical response , bacteriological response examine . Total free plasma concentration polymyxin B determine . Bacterial isolates examine emergence polymyxin resistance . The relationship polymyxin B PK , PD TD end-points ( e.g . clinical bacteriological response , development toxicity resistance ) assess use pharmacometric analysis . Finally , obtain information use apply Monte Carlo simulation examine impact various patient characteristic factor polymyxin B PK , PD TD , order establish optimal dosage regimens AFC algorithms individual critically-ill patient . Significance : No new antibiotic available Gram-negative 'superbugs ' many year . This landmark multicenter study provide essential information optimize polymyxin B use critically-ill patient , minimize resistance toxicity . This proposal align perfectly NIAID priority `` To teach old drug new trick '' recent Executive Order White House combat antibiotic resistance .</detailed_description>
