	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit accord inclusion/exclusion criterion . The investigator employ multifaceted approach recruitment , include flyer , community newspaper ad , internet ad posting , direct recruitment Internal Medicine Clinics Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital/Medical College Wisconsin saw approximately 50,000 unique outpatient visit last year . The electronic health record leverage identify potential subject HIPAA guideline Medical College Wisconsin policy . Potential subject undergo phenotyping include detailed medical history , anthropomorphic measurement , blood pressure heart rate measurement , blood draw measurement include fast lipid , glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , creatinine , liver function test . Healthy , non-DM subject pass screen per inclusion/exclusion criterion Table 2 enrol study protocol . Following overnight fast ( 12 hour ) , subject come morning Adult Translational Research Unit ( A-TRU ) part Clinical Translational Research Initiative Southeast Wisconsin ( 8UL1TR000055 ) . An antecubital intravenous line place facilitate blood glucose sample hyperglycemic challenge . An antecubital intravenous catheter place facilitate obtain endothelial cell vein J-wire biopsy mitochondrial testing . The principal investigator publish experience J-wire endothelial cell biopsy technique , technique extensively validate technique . An initial venous glucose sample take antecubital vein initial J-wire biopsy radial artery endothelium perform radial arterial line . Subjects ask drink standardized 75 g glucose drink create A-TRU nutritionist- standard oral glucose challenge use clinically . Blood glucose sample take hourly 4 hour post drink ingestion . At one 4 hour post-ingestion , J-wire endothelial biopsy radial artery repeat . Four separate J wire pass radial artery measurement time point ( 0,1 , 4 hour ) . In non-diabetic subject , 75 g oral challenge induces peak increase systemic glucose 1-hour post-administration time endothelial dysfunction concomitantly detectable . Endothelial cell obtain via J-wire capture technique . A portion endothelial cell isolate J-wires used measure mitochondrial network complexity prior hyperglycemic challenge , 1-hour post challenge , 4 hour post challenge . The investigator visualize mitochondrial network cell use previously report validated immunofluorescence method use cytochrome c antibody tag mitochondrion . Network fragmentation ( high number=greater fragmentation fission ) quantify network fragmentation count calculate ImageJ ( NIH , Bethesda ) use validate protocol .</detailed_description>
