	<criteria>1 . Informed consent parent guardian emancipate minor prior studyrelated procedure 2 . When applicable , informed assent subject ( deemed appropriate Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board ) prior studyrelated procedure 3 . Current history SBS result major intestinal resection , ( eg , due necrotizing enterocolitis , midgut volvulus , intestinal atresia , gastroschisis ) 4 . Short bowel syndrome require PN/IV support provide least 30 % caloric and/or fluid/electrolyte need prior screen 5 . Stable PN/IV support , define inability significantly reduce PN/IV support , usually associate minimal advance enteral feed ( ie , 10 % less change PN advance feed ) least 3 month prior screen , assessed investigator . 6 . Sexually active female subject childbearing potential ( teduglutide treatment arm ) must use medically acceptable method birth control 4 week treatment period 1 . Subjects expect able advance oral tube feed regimen 2 . Serial transverse enteroplasty bowel lengthen procedure perform within 3 month screen 3 . Known clinically significant untreated intestinal obstruction contribute feed intolerance inability reduce parenteral support 4 . Unstable absorption due cystic fibrosis know DNA abnormalities 5 . Severe , know dysmotility syndrome , pseudoobstruction persistent , severe , active gastroschisisrelated dysmotility , primary contribute factor feed intolerance inability reduce parenteral support , prior screen . Dysmotility define severe expect limit advancement enteral feeding . 6 . Evidence clinically significant obstruction upper GI series do within 6 month prior screen . 7 . Major GI surgical intervention include significant intestinal resection within 3 month prior screen visit ( insertion feed tube , anastomotic ulcer repair , minor intestinal resection ≤ 10 cm , endoscopic procedure allow ) . 8 . Unstable cardiac disease , congenital heart disease cyanotic disease , exception subject undergone ventricular atrial septal defect repair , patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) ligation . 9 . History cancer clinically significant lymphoproliferative disease , include resect cutaneous basal squamous cell carcinoma , situ non aggressive surgically resected cancer . 10 . Pregnant lactate female subject ( teduglutide treatment arm ) . 11 . Participation clinical study use experimental drug ( glutamine Omegaven ) within 3 month 5.5 halflives experimental drug , whichever longer , prior screen , duration study . 12 . Previous use teduglutide native/synthetic glucagonlike peptide2 ( GLP2 ) 13 . Previous use glucagonlike peptide1 analog human growth hormone within 3 month prior screen 14 . Previous use octreotide , dipeptidyl peptidase4 ( DPP4 ) inhibitor within 3 month prior screen 15 . Subjects active Crohn 's disease treat biological therapy ( eg , antitumor necrosis factor [ antiTNF ] ) within 6 month prior screen visit 16 . Subjects inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) require chronic systemic immunosuppressant therapy introduce change 3 month prior screen 17 . More 3 SBSrelated PNrelated hospital admission ( eg , document infectionrelated catheter sepsis , clot , bowel obstruction , severe waterelectrolyte disturbance ) within 3 month prior screen visit 18 . Any major unscheduled hospital admission affect parenteral support requirement within 1 month prior screening , exclude uncomplicated treatment bacteremia , central line replacement/repair , issue similar magnitude otherwise stable subject 19 . Body weight &lt; 10 kg screen baseline visit 20 . Signs active severe unstable , clinically significant hepatic impairment screen period , indicate follow laboratory test result : 1 . Total bilirubin ( TBL ) ≥ 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) 2 . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≥ 7x ULN 3 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≥ 7x ULN For subject Gilbert 's disease : 4 . Indirect ( unconjugated ) bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN 21 . Signs know continuous active unstable , clinically significant renal dysfunction show result estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 . 22 . Parent ( ) and/or subject capable understand willing adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement 23 . Unstable , clinically significant active , untreated pancreatic biliary disease 24 . Any condition , disease , illness , circumstance investigator 's opinion put subject undue risk , prevents completion study , interfere analysis study result .</criteria>
