	<detailed_description>Demographically , geriatric population expand . It also increasingly find emergency services.However , emergency service design accommodate patient , whose need specific . This population define complex physical psychosocial need , include comprehensive geriatric assessment complex carry emergency service . The multidisciplinary care need take time . Several option investigate worldwide properly manage fragile patient : - Scales frailty functional decline screen - Specialized care unit : Mobile Geriatric Team , Emergency short-stay unit , acute care geriatric unit , geriatric nurse liaison model , service specific geriatric emergency . Many publication focus way prevent potentially avoidable visit geriatric patient emergency service . People rely upon therapeutic limitation code establish patient determine intensity care may give . However , geriatric patient arrive emergency service already give code . As consequence , intensity care give emergency patient influenced perception functional cognitive status patient , even part perception incorrect . Moreover , also well establish outcome geriatric patient severe pathology admission often poor need find alternative intensive treatment offer . The goal study determine prevalence presence therapeutic limitation code geriatric patient hospital admission / admission emergency department , leave hospital . This carry geriatric patient reside place nursing home end hospitalization.The investigator postulate establish therapeutic limitation code fragile patient , leave hospital nursing home , would reduce number future admission patient emergency department . Furthermore , study offer prospective establish future systematic implementation therapeutic limitation code geriatric patient reside nursing home , therefore anticipate various issue specific population emergency department .</detailed_description>
