	<brief_summary>Patients mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) median survival 3-5 year despite treatment . Indeed , best therapeutic approach different patient MCL remain establish , coexist different option immunochemotherapy regime may include autologous transplantation first-line treatment rituximab maintenance . Moreover , last year MCL start recognize heterogeneous disease biological clinical stand point . For instance , MCL case non-nodal clinical presentation , usually distinctive biological feature SOX-11 negativity , hypermutated IGHV gene low number genetic lesion associate . The outcome case much favourable compare conventional MCL , reach median survival 7 10 year even receive less intensive treatment . In addition , 30 % patient newly diagnose MCL safely defer initial therapy progression . Therapeutic abstention may prolong one year 50 % case . These patient usually show long survival start treatment compare patient immediately treat diagnosis . Therefore , observation indicate indolent clinical form MCL , clinico-biological identification crucial tailor treatment appropriately . However , present consensus diagnostic criterion treatment recommendation case indolent MCL . This result difficulties identification form clinical practice well certain therapeutic definition , indolent form MCL treat either therapeutic abstention progression receive immediate treatment conventional intensive immuno-chemotherapy regime , may even include autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . With emergence new biological agent therapeutic arsenal MCL arise question whether completely different approach new drug chemotherapy-free could appropriate select subset patient indolent MCL form .</brief_summary>
