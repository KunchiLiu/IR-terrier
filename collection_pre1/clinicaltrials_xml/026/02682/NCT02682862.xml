	<brief_title>Ultra-long Acting Bronchodilator Therapy Smoking Asthmatics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoke asthma associate poor asthma control high frequency asthma attack . Despite , smoke cessation rate low due highly addictive nature tobacco smoking . Asthma smoker particularly challenge manage resistant beneficial effect inhaled corticosteroid , main treatment asthma . Unfortunately , guideline consensus regard best manage asthmatic smoke . Research study asthma tend exclude smoker concern recruit patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Hence , unmet need research study asthmatics unable stop smoking . In view , propose assess effect two different type bronchodilator ( inhaler help open airway ) , asthmatic continue smoke . Participants receive follow drug 2-4 week random order , 2-3 week washout period : Olodaterol new long-acting bronchodilator . Olodaterol combine tiotropium ( dual bronchodilator ) . We wish compare inhaler use sensitive pulmonary function test call impulse oscillometry .</detailed_description>
