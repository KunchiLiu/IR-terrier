	<brief_summary>This pilot study evaluate efficacy hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBO2 ) mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cell bone marrow blood . These cell need patient undergo bone marrow transplantation patient fail respond current best chemotherapy . HBO2 show trigger stem cell mobilization patient population plan investigate whether intervention act concert chemotherapeutic agent allow poor mobilizer patient achieve successful bone marrow transplantation . Twenty patient identify participate hematologist fail respond adequately chemotherapy . When deem appropriate attempt additional stem cell mobilization protocol , patient administer chemotherapy determine primary treat hematologist additionally receive daily HBO2 ( 2.5 atmosphere absolute [ ATA ] 90 minute ) 3-8 day . At interval , blood sample obtain normal transplantation protocol practice ass whether adequate stem cell present blood patient proceed transplantation . The project anticipate take one year complete .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study subject patient fail achieve adequate mobilization hematopoietic progenitor cell ( so-called stem cell ) blood stream safely proceed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation component treatment hematological malignancy . There several possible chemo-mobilization procedure primary clinician may prescribe blood cell count end procedure document inadequate number transplantation , accept clinical course action repeat procedure sometimes add another drug , plerixafor . This investigation base single center abstract present hematological meeting ( 2012 ASCO University Annual Meeting ) 7 9 patient previously identify poor mobilizers achieve sufficient mobilization addition hyperbaric oxygen therapy standard care ( 1 ) . This project recapitulate study somewhat large patient population ( 20 subject ) . Once individual identify poor mobilizer , mean failed standard therapy mobilize sufficient stem cell proceed bone marrow transplantation , approach one investigator , inform study ask sign inform consent . After period time identify 'rest period ' ( typically 2-4 week , exact duration decision make primary clinician oversee patient 's care ) begin treatment another attempt mobilize adequate number hematopoietic progenitor cell ( define 2 x 10^6 cells/kg body weight ) . A blood sample obtain determine baseline number stem cell ( aspect normal clinical care ) also extra 4 ml tube blood obtain additional study do PI 's lab ( added evaluation hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) within circulate stem cell may influence function currently recognize clinical relevance ) . A component normal care point daily injection drug call Neupogen . In order accommodate need time normal clinical procedure anticipate time-course hyperbaric oxygen therapy-induced stem cell mobilization , study protocol begin Thursday Neupogen injection plus 90 minute exposure hyperbaric oxygen pressure 2.4 atmosphere absolute ( normal protocol follow Hyperbaric Oxygen [ HBO2 ] Therapy Service daily treatment elective patient ) . Neupogen plus HBO2 repeat Friday , Saturday Sunday Neupogen injection administer . On Monday Neupogen plus HBO2 repeat Tuesday morning blood sample obtain . This count stem cell asses adequate number mobilize ( hence aspect normal clinical care ) also extra 4 ml tube blood obtain additional study HIF stem cell do PI 's lab . If cell count exceed 20/ml blood subject undergo apheresis harvest stem cell day . If cell count less 20/ml , subject receive Neupogen injection HBO2 additional drug part normal care call plerixafor . On Wednesday morning blood sample obtain ass adequate stem cell number mobilize ( hence aspect normal clinical care ) also extra 4 ml tube blood obtain additional study do PI 's lab . If cell count exceed 20/ml blood subject undergo apheresis harvest stem cell day . If cell count still less 20/ml blood , subject receive Neupogen injection HBO2 additional dose plerixafor . It anticipate Thursday morning , another blood cell count do , study subject able proceed harvest stem cell apheresis procedure . Doses agent use chemotherapy determine patient 's primary treating hematologist accord standard treatment guideline ( Neupogen plerixafor ) . The experimental intervention inclusion daily HBO2 ( 2.4 ATA 90 minute ) administer 3-5 day . Assessment blood progenitor cell mobilization follow standard clinical evaluation protocol . No additional intervention perform . The addition standard clinical analysis obtain extra 4 ml tube blood phlebotomy session study perform PI 's lab include analysis progenitor cell sub-types , content hypoxia inducible factor activity nitric oxide synthase-3 platelet follow publish method ( 3 ) .</detailed_description>
