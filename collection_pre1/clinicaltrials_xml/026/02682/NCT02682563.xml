Study Completion The study consider complete individual participant he/she complete final test . The study whole consider complete planned randomized subject complete treatment phase , follow final measurement . Study Procedures Renal protocol During protocol combine inulin/para-aminohippurate ( PAH ) -clearance technique perform examine glomerular filtration rate ( GFR , ml/min ) effective renal plasma flow ( ERPF , ml/min ) respectively . In order examine tubular function , sodium , potassium , chloride , calcium , magnesium , phosphate , urea glucose measure urine ( mmol ) . In addition , urine osmolality determine . Moreover , biomarkers renal damage ( urinary albumin excretion ( UAE ) , Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ( KIM-1 ) measure urine Clamp protocol A combine hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic hyperglycemic clamp perform . During euglycemic clamp insulin infuse 40 microunits/square meter.minute ( mU/m2.min ) glucose kept 5 mmol/l variable glucose 20 % infusion . This technique allow renal measurement normoglycemia participant . After 3 hour insulin infusion one hour rest period exogenous insulin clear , glucose infused order reach plasma concentration 15 mmol/l . In matter , renal test perform stable hyperglycemia . From euglycemic clamp , insulin sensitivity determine amount glucose infuse ( M-value ) . Blood store hyperglycemia order able obtain measure beta-cell function , include 1st phase insulin secretion , 2nd phase insulin secretion arginine-induced insulin secretion . Blood pressure : The investigator use automatic oscillometric device ( Dinamap® , General Electric ( GE ) Healthcare ) entire study reduce possible bias . After acclimatization period &gt; 5 minute , blood pressure measure three time non-dominant arm , subject semi-recumbent position , use appropriate cuff-size . The mean last 2 measurement use final value . Body fat content To measure body fat content investigator use tetrapolar Soft Tissue Analyzer® ( STA , Akern , Florence , Italy ) , perform Bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) . This technique measure resistance body tissue 50 kilohertz ( kHz ) alternate current ( AC ) electrical current give four electrode . Resistance measure place two electrode dorsal hand two foot unilateral side body . Extracellular water ( ECW ) percentage total body water ( TBW ) body cell mass ( BCM ) calculate independent weight height .

For , automate , beat-to-beat blood pressure ECG record monitor ( Nexfin® , BMEYE , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) use . Microvascular function Microvascular function measure nail fold skin capillary density middle finger , 4 minute arterial occlusion digital cuff , yield data baseline capillary density post-occlusive reactive hyperemia , respectively . Moreover , vasomotion analysis perform , skin blood flow measure use Laser Doppler probe . Pulse Wave Analysis ( PWA ) Applanation tonometry use SphygmoCor® system ( Atcor Medical , West Ryde , Australia ) perform measure variable arterial stiffness . For PWA , tonometer apply radial artery non-dominant arm . The SphygmoCor® system calculate Augmentation index ( AIx ) pulse wave . Cardiac Autonomous Nervous System ( CANS ) function To test drug-related change autonomic nervous function impact cardiovascular system investigator measure rest heart rate variability ( HRV ) ( 63 ) perform Cardiovascular Autonomic Reflex Tests ( CARTs ) , modify battery Ewing test . Using automated , beat-to-beat blood pressure ECG record monitor ( Nexfin® , BM Eye , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) heart rate blood pressure record : resting , take deep breath , exhalation mouth-piece measurable resistance ( Valsalva maneuver ) stand supine position . Information regard change parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system function derive measurement use dedicated software . Fecal examination Each participant collect stool sample baseline test long-term follow-up test . At home , one feces sample must store room temperature one freezer arrive CRU , feces store -20⁰C -80⁰C , respectively . Stool sample store possible analysis biomarkers , include calprotectin . Since become increasingly clear gut microbiome might involve development obesity T2DM chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) disease , investigator also store analyze feces microbial content . SAFETY ( REPORTING ) In accordance guideline ICH-GCP , European Clinical Trials Directive ( 2001/20/EC ) local regulation , investigator inform subject review Ethical Review Board ( ERB ) anything occur , basis appear disadvantage participation may significantly great foreseen research proposal . Safety Evaluations The follow safety measure collect study : - Occurrence adverse event ( report subject ) - Vital sign ( pulse rate , blood pressure , temperature ) - Different end-point assessment also serve safety measurement : blood chemistry hematology . Collection adverse event information begin sign informed consent continue 30 day administration last dose study medication . Reporting Each serious adverse event ( SAE ) investigate thoroughly assessment make whether SAE suspect unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR , i.e . unexpected drug-related , indicated recent Summary product characteristic ( SPC ) provide drug supplier ) . Because study investigator sponsor trial ( IST ) , investigator also act sponsor . Therefore , investigator responsible reporting SAEs SUSARs accredit ERB . This do within 15 day first knowledge , use specify web portal ( 'ToetsingOnline ' ) , automatically lead inform respective national health authority . For fatal life threaten SAEs SUSARs term 7 day preliminary report ( 'expedited ' ) another 8 day completion report . The expedited reporting web portal 'ToetsingOnline ' sufficient notification competent authority . Since study monocenter study , sit inform . The involved pharmaceutical company ( AstraZeneca ) notify SAEs , pregnancy , clinical relevant overdose adverse event special interest ( AESIs ) , . These event must transmit within 1 work day Investigator 's awareness identification event , use standardized form . Reports consist patient identification ( subject number , initial , sex , age ) , event ( diagnosis ) , drug reporter identification ( name , initial ) , causality outcome write English . Results relevant complementary exam perform obtain final diagnosis SAE ( e.g. , hospital discharge summary , autopsy , consultation ) make available AstraZeneca entity upon request . Follow-up AEs All AEs follow abate , stable situation reach . Depending event , follow may require additional test medical procedure indicate , and/or referral general physician medical specialist . The follow-up information describe whether event resolve continue , treat , whether patient continue discontinue study participation . DATA MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Handling storage data document . In accordance Dutch law 'Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens ' ( WBP ; Personal Data Protection Act ) GCP patient data handle confidentially anonymously . Therefore , participant get study code ( 'RED-xxx ' ) . The code list , identifier data study number , store securely server VUMC , protect password know responsible research physician principal investigator . All subject data record printed case report form ( CRF ) authorize investigator ( i.e . research physician ) and/or personnel instruct perform administrative task study procedure . In latter case , data always review investigator . All subject relate data store 15 year . Subject data , anonymous ( e.g . CRFs ) ( e.g . source document ) , always store securely , lock cabinet Diabetes Center VUMC password secure computer . Data Management To ensure correct entrance data CRF database use statistical analysis , special database program call OpenClinica© ( Community Edition , v3.1.2 , OpenClinica© , LLC , Waltham , MA , USA ) use . A study environment build , contain specific visit necessary data entry field . Electronic-CRFs ( eCRF ) make , similar hardcopy CRFs . These eCRFs enhance safeguard query warrant correct entry data . The investigator , his/her designate representative , enter data hardcopy print CRF eCRFs , automatically store data database . All change make database log ( 'audit trail ' ) , require GCP . On regular basis data OpenClinica©-database extract Excel-file backup purpose . Monitoring As require GCP , monitoring procedure perform order oversee progress clinical trial ensure conduct , record report accordance protocol , standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) , GCP applicable regulatory requirement . Because risk classification current study estimate `` moderate risk '' , 2-3 monitor visit require per year . Monitoring perform GCP-certified assistant Clinical Research Bureau VUMC . The monitor verify inclusion patient , use investigational medicinal product ( e.g . drug accountability ) , source document report adverse event accord pre-defined format . The finding report investigator . STATISTICS Sample Size Calculations The primary end-point change GFR/ERPF 12 week treatment dapagliflozin gliclazide , derive inulin/PAH clearance test . Based literature investigator use follow calculation define sample size : detect change GFR 89 mL/min 75 mL/min ( 16 % ) , SD 13.0 mL/min , assume α = 0.05 ( 2-sided testing ) , power ( 1-β ) 90 % , investigator need 19 subject per group . However , take account maximum dropout percentage 15 % , investigator choose increase amount subject per group N=22 . This sample size calculate use Stata-software ( v.11.2 , College Station , Texas , USA ) . Statistical Analysis Plan All test difference treatment conduct two-sided significance level &lt; 0.05 . In general , null hypothesis ( H0 : difference exist treatment group ) test hypothesis H1 : difference exist treatment group , respect underlie parameter interest . All variable express mean ± standard error measurement ( SEM ) normally distribute , -in case non-normal distribution- express median interquartile range ( IQR ) . Log transformation apply obtain normal distribution appropriate statistical test . In case miss data , multiple imputation technique apply compare complete case analysis . Analysis population The efficacy analysis population base per protocol ( PP ) principle - i.e . subject complete entire treatment period use treatment originally allocate . Safety analysis perform patient receive one dos study medication . Statistical analysis study endpoint In order compare effect two study arm investigator perform t-tests and/or multivariable linear regression model . The latter technique allow u use continuous outcome variable continuous dichotomous independent variable . The efficacy endpoint interest add model dependent variable . Treatment group add independent categorical variable . Appropriate covariates may add model . Baseline measurement specific variable ( e.g . age , gender ) add regression model covariates difference baseline value variable occur treatment group . Moreover , correction perform relevant specific endpoint . The possible covariates elaborate prior conduct statistic . For possible confounders , investigator test whether association dependent independent variable ( p &lt; 0.1 ) . If case , confounder add model covariate . Since outcome variable - primary , secondary exploratory - continuous , statistical technique apply . Our primary outcome important outcome test hypothesis SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin versus SU gliclazide cause improvement renal hemodynamics . The large amount secondary/exploratory endpoint potentially justifies use correction multiple test . However , increase debate whether do , increase risk type 2 error could lead prematurely discard potential useful observation . As recently point , hypothesis-generating study - current study - correction multiple outcome detrimental . A final decision make detailed Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP ) prior conduction analysis . 13 . ETHICS The trial conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki ( 64th World Medical Association ( WMA ) General Assembly , Fortaleza , Brazil , October 2013 ) biomedical research involve human subject accordance ICH-GCP . The investigator ensure aspects institutional ERB review conduct accordance current institutional , local national regulation . Ethical review Any member ERB directly affiliate study investigator site personnel must abstain ERB vote approval protocol . Informed consent form trial subject Prior trial related activity , investigator give oral write information trial form subject read understand . It investigators responsibility ensure trial subject fully inform aim trial , procedure , potential risk , discomfort expect benefit . The investigator must ensure subject inform agree VUMC personnel , representative possibly health authority ( national ) personnel require access subject 's data . It must emphasize participation voluntary subject right withdraw trial time without prejudice . A voluntary , sign date 'Informed Consent ' obtain subject prior trial related procedure . The write informed consent must sign person conduct informed consent . If information become available may relevant subject 's willingness continue participate trial , investigator must inform subject timely manner revise write informed consent must obtain . Unexpected finding report participant general practitioner . If participant want inform , he/she participate trial . A physician involved interest performance trial available ; person knowledge protocol consult subject potentially interested participation . Financial Compensation All subject receive financial compensation participation ( base minimum wag The Netherlands ) . The investigator determine €300 participant complete entire study ( define Chapter 6 ) . Moreover , reimbursement travelling expense give base current price public transportation . Study Medication Participants randomize 12 week treatment two different active study agent . Consequently , independent treatment allocation , beneficial effect expect , SGLT-2 inhibitor SU derivative improve glycemic control . Both study medication approve blood-glucose lower treatment T2DM patient , base currently available data , consider safe . Furthermore , SGLT-2 inhibitor general may decrease blood pressure body weight compare gliclazide . The common side effect dapagliflozin hypoglycemia ( especially use combination SU derivative insulin ) genital mycotic- urinary tract infection . These side effect usually mild transient . In addition dyslipidemia increase hematocrit described . Long-term ( side ) effect SGLT-2 inhibitor currently evaluate large-scaled outcome trial . For gliclazide , hypoglycemia blur vision initiation phase treatment ( due change blood glucose level ) common side effect . Also gastrointestinal side-effects ( nausea , vomit , diarrhea constipation ) report . Of note , gliclazide study use relatively low dose ( i.e . 30 mg per day ) relatively short treatment duration ( 12 week ) . Therefore , also give inclusion- exclusion criterion study participant , overall risk hypoglycemia believe low . In unlikely case hypoglycemia symptom , patient provide self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) device instruct perform ambulatory blood glucose check case symptom , course study . Also , receive standardize diabetes education , include information regard carbohydrate use self-management / resolution hypoglycemia . As drug intervention trial , study , investigator closely monitor patient adverse drug study event follow-up visit telephone consultation accord GCP . Participants contact research staff 24 hour day . Safety issue The study examinations/tests consider safe . No invasive procedure ( besides intravenous peripheral catheter ) involve . During study test , two 'diagnostic agent ' ( i.e . inulin PAH ) need administer ; agent inert side effect . The total amount draw blood 500 mL total period 16 week . Side effect expect blood volume take per visit relatively small , especially comparison regular blood donation , 500 mL per donation ( allow 5 time year men 3 time woman ) . Risk classification The Dutch Federation University Medical Centers ( Dutch : 'Nederlandse Federatie van Universitair Medische Centra ' ) propose guideline determination risk classification clinical trial . As state , study medication examinations/test generally consider safe , small increase risk hypoglycemia . For latter , appropriate measure take minimize risk . Within T2DM population , study population consider relatively low risk . However , sporadic serious side effect describe ( dehydration , hypovolemia , severe hypoglycemia ) , although patient recover quickly . Therefore , low risk , possible consequence might 'moderate ' 'serious ' . Therefore , investigator feel current study classification 'moderate risk ' .
