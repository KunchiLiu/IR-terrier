	<brief_title>T1 Diabetes Hypoglycemia Prevention Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center 12-week Pilot trial one arm . Subjects serve control . The study include usual care patient MDI ( multiple daily injection ) CSII ( continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ) additional use Vigilant ™ Diabetes Management System . There 4-week baseline period prior 12-week intervention . Subject participation 4-week baseline period last 2-4 hour two visit . Subjects participate intervention phase 12 week require one additional visit ( 2-3 hour ) 3 month , routine population . Participants provide wireless blood glucose meter duration study download Vigilant mobile application mobile phone . The Vigilant™ system store blood glucose test result , pattern event , user setting . In addition receive blood glucose measurement enter user , store displaying , Vigilant™ provide follow feature tool user : - Blood Glucose Reading review editing : The user able review data log manually edit blood glucose result . - Pattern Messages : Alerts user one pattern find result enter , include pattern indicative risk severe hypoglycemia next 24 hour . - Long Term Control Summary : Identifies current retrospective blood glucose average variability . The following blood glucose pattern identify Vigilant application : - Weekly monthly glucose average overall within daily time period - Daily period infrequent test - Daily period high , low variable blood glucose ( `` Daily Pattern Messaging System '' ) - Patterns blood glucose indicative increase risk low blood glucose level next 24 hour ( `` Hypo Risk Indicator '' ) - Weekly monthly blood glucose variability ( `` Average Daily Risk Range ADDR '' ) Vigilant™ incorporate `` Tutorial Mode '' offer detailed feedback meaning pattern analyse perform software . In addition , two separate training video develop patient clinician initiate use understanding device feature . Caregivers access information outline , well summary screen highlight glycemic control metric patient risk notification patient Vigilant , subject patient approval . Subjects recruit one diabetes clinic . Patients type I diabetes history mild moderate hypoglycemia assess see eligible study . All consider eligible approached give write , informed consent attend screen visit inclusion criterion check . At Screening Visit follow procedure perform / criterion check document : - Signed date informed consent - Assignment subject number - Inclusion exclusion criterion - Demographics ( date birth , gender , race ethnicity ) - Diabetes history ( subject ) - Professional history ( diabetes clinician ) - SMBG training study meter - Use study hypoglycemia diary - Completion study questionnaire After consent , participant participate 4-week run in/baseline period 12 week pilot intervention collect baseline data glycemic control hypoglycemia ass adherence test criterion . All participant ask conduct SMBG ( self-monitoring blood glucose ) three time day ask record clinical detail hypoglycemia event . At end 4-week baseline period , participant return study visit investigator complete following : - Download SMBG hypoglycemia diary data - Obtain A1C - Affirmation participant commitment test record To continue study , subject need obtain least three blood glucose value per day record hypoglycemia symptom episode . Prior 12-week intervention period , study participant complete validate study questionnaire ( Hypoglycemia Fear , Diabetes Empowerment Survey etc. ) . At visit 2 , subject complete train Vigilant™ program . They watch video demonstration iPhone , Android iPod Touch explain use Vigilant™ device . Study participant provide wireless blood glucose monitor ask follow normal diabetes management program subsequent 12 week . They ask use Vigilant™ program home conjunction provide wireless meter subsequent 12 week , accord follow instruction : The subject follow typical blood glucose-testing regimen , exception must perform average least 3 fingerstick blood glucose measurement daily time . - Subjects ask keep log HRI ( hypoglycemia risk indicator ) pattern message receive , enter glucose reading deliver time , diabetes management action choose perform message receive . - Subjects ask log 1 ) whether understand feedback give , 2 ) action take address pattern , . - Subjects require perform specific diabetes management action address identify pattern . Worksheets provide patient facilitate record keep pattern message feedback . - It prefer subject use predominantly study supplied meter course 12 week home use ( two glucometers maximum ) . - Subjects instruct change date / time meter event change 1 ) daylight saving time , 2 ) travel different time zone , match iPod touch Phone clock time . - S/he instructed proper SMBG technique include use water dry towel prior test , avoid alternate site testing , use second hanging blood drop . The subject ask demonstrate SMBG test visit document proper technique . Participants follow three month 12-week intervention period . Subjects also receive telephone email communication study manager within several day begin home use portion study ensure patient understands protocol enter data accord instruction . At time also ask send several screen shot application log data pattern identify , ensure device work accord intend use data enter . Another follow occur 4 week study patient ask question give instruction . Subjects involve study also allow Vigilant-using clinician see Vigilant pattern , also plan see Vigilant-using clinician least regular check Vigilant use period ( do Visit 3 , desire ) . A follow-up final visit ( 3 ) occur three-month end 12 week intervention period , typical routine schedule usual care . Additional visit may schedule provider indicate diabetes management . The following procedure perform follow-up visit : - Blood draw HbA1c - Download SMBG data - Review patient diary data - Data collection hypoglycemia event - Review Vigilant pattern message patient log - Completion study questionnaire survey</detailed_description>
