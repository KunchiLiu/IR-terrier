	<brief_summary>This study use dual energy x-ray compute tomography ( DECT ) evaluate relationship heterogeneous perfusion , hypoxia ( low oxygen inspire gas ) induction pulmonary vascular dilatation characterize emphysema susceptibility normal smoke population . The investigator correlate DECT measure perfusion lung injury measure single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) . The investigator study effect pulmonary arterial vasodilation see eliminate index persistent lung injury smoker susceptible emphysema</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional CT Assessment Pulmonary Arterial Dysfunction Smoking Associated Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imaging-based metric recently play central role quest identify chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) phenotype , serve establish homogeneous sub-populations aid genotyping , therapeutic target design outcomes assessment . Recent finding animal human lead u believe CT derive perfusion ( PBF ) mean transit time ( MTT ) measure within regionally injure lung parenchyma provide functional phenotype may directly tie etiology pathologic process lead emphysema acentrilobular emphysema susceptible subset smoking population . The primary hypothesis proposal build around notion smoker prone emphysema abnormal vasoregulation regional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction ( HPV ) continue despite regional lung injury . This failure block vasoconstriction alters repair response lead tissue destruction emphysema susceptible smoker ( SS ) abnormal vasoregulation . The normal response regional hypoxia shunt blood towards better-ventilated region . However , smoke induces small scale , regional infiltrates turn lead local hypoxia , HPV would interfere defense mechanism serve clear irritant thus interfere mechanisms repair . The investigator demonstrate , SS subject normal PFTs CT evidence early centriacinar emphysema ( CAE ) , increased heterogeneity perfusion . This supportive notion attenuation vasoconstriction fail . Further , investigator demonstrate tight correlation quantitative CT evidence emphysema reduce lung volume ( LV ) fill small amount emphysema . The investigator outline series experiment seek : 1. link increase pulmonary perfusion heterogeneity SS subject lung 's response alveolar oxygenation ; 2. establish perfusion heterogeneity reversible ; 3. demonstrate response inflammation inflammation key factor increase heterogeneity finally ; 4. demonstrate , alleviate heterogeneous vasoconstriction , parenchymal hyper-density associate smoke clear quickly association smoke cessation . With combination positive outcome study , investigator provide new insight disease etiology , serve provide new target disease intervention providing tool need assess outcome .</detailed_description>
