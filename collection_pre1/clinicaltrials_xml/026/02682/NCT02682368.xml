	<brief_summary>Both acute gallbladder pathology diverticular disease common condition meet emergency department western world comprise bulk admission throughout general surgical call . On hand entity need imagistic confirmation description tailor management , may readily available moment patient 's presentation A &amp; E 's doorstep referral call general surgeon . These delay may lose window opportunity emergency surgery prolong unnecessary admission patient know condition may need fast exclusion advance stage treat conservatively even discharge . The increased length stay , investigator know expect rise cost healthcare delicate subject nowadays medical practice . Investigators think USS perform bedside help decrease length stay , especially weekend admission radiology readily available . Ultrasound scan ( USS ) become popular last half century equipment become compact , high quality less expensive , facilitated growth point-of-care ultrasonography — , USS perform interpreted clinician bedside . The concept 'ultrasound stethoscope ' rapidly move theory reality . Since 1993 surgeon-performed US come attention 79th Annual Clinical Congress American College Surgeons . Nowadays USS extend successfully acute setting , several USA residency program several EU country , bed side imaging include training curriculum stand alone competence non radiological medical practitioner . Alas still norm across EU entire USA despite study prove usefulness . As example , currently Ireland surgeon perform US popular skill . The present paper propose address issue large scale present study , tend confine limited number patient hospital different approach . Currently , European Society Trauma &amp; Emergency Surgery® provide modular USS course imbue surgeon necessary skill perform bedside US condition like trauma ( FAST scan ) , acute cholecystitis . Also paper aim leap forward , skilled ultrasonographers diagnose classify diverticular disease . The paper divide two part , general part ( extensive literature review basic science gesture US perform ) second part original research . The closing remark learning procedure surgeon perform USS n't undermine his/her radiologist colleague 's authority skill . The big picture basic task transferrable used appropriate methodical manner final common goal - benefit patient - readily achieve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study accept Master Surgery Thesis Research ( MCh ) Royal College Surgeons Ireland ( RCSI ) There two parallel study do time : 1 . Bed-side surgeon perform ultrasound scan ( USS ) biliary pathology 2 . Bed-side surgeon perform USS suspect diverticulitis There number ultrasound course surgeon radiologist teach surgeon perform basic USS regard suspect cholelithiasis diverticular disease . The course endorse European Society Trauma Emergency Surgery ( ESTES ) . As note , student surgeon little-to-none experience ultrasound scan . The course website follow link : http : //www.thesoundofthebody.org This course 2 4 module basic USS teach large hands-on experience . Then 15-20 examination supervision per student do embark study . A good chance induction room elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy , patient know gallbladder disease . STUDY Patients suspect biliary pathology diverticular disease ( per inclusion criterion ) come Emergency Department ( ED ) , clinic , preoperatively consult hospital undergo USS do naive surgeon train one course . Patients explain procedure , leaflet information inform consent sign . Bed-side USS perform usually immediately several hour presentation ( depend type consult request ) , result measurement record data sheet ( one type data sheet study -biliary diverticular- ) . Pictures image save well quality control . Time , date record well . Then patient departmental USS/CAT-Scan ( depend pathology suspect ) do qualified radiologist . Or instance patient undergo surgery scan compare intra-operative finding . In Ireland usually take long time , patient may come ED Friday USS do radiology department Monday . The radiologist perform USS/CT/MRI know patient already scan surgeon . In Ireland radiologist 's report upload online system name NIMIS ( The National Integrated Medical Imaging System ) , along time date actual scanning , time date reporting ( report instantly ) . Data collect store anonymously , process Microsoft Excel , IMB SPSS , R-studio The rule apply hospital country get involve study . As soon Investigators name approval get involve , uploaded ClinicalTrials .</detailed_description>
