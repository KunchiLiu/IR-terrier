	<brief_title>Low-Level Laser Therapy Prevention Oral Mucositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase II , single-arm trial examine efficacy prophylactic low-level laser therapy ( LLLT ) reduce incidence oral mucositis adverse event patient receive combined modality therapy consist chemotherapy radiation therapy head neck cancer . Patients meet eligibility criterion enrol receive prophylactic LLLT addition standard care measure oral mucositis toxicity therapy . The radiation chemotherapy dose , schedule , modality , technique , require adjustment influence protocol follow standard exist institutional practice . Patients receive LLLT three time per week concurrently chemoradiotherapy . LLLT may deliver either immediately prior patient 's daily fraction radiotherapy . Patients treat extra-orally THORÂ® LED cluster one minute along buccal mucosa side intraorally one minute tongue soft palate . During LLLT treatment session thorough oral exam perform identify area mucositis . If patient develop intraoral lesion target directly intraoral probe one minute site mucositis . The laser setting use follow : frequency 2.5 Hz ; wavelength 660 nm ; power 75 mW , energy 4.5 J . Patients evaluate prior therapy , weekly therapy , two week completion therapy , three month completion therapy . During assessment , follow toxicity assess : pain , mucositis , dysphagia , xerostomia , dysgeusia , dermatitis , trismus , quality life . Previous study indicate approximately 40 % patient experience severe mucositis radiation concurrent chemotherapy . The hypothesis trial addition LLLT treatment regimen decrease rate severe acute OM 20 % . We plan enroll 25 patient institution 12 month trial open .</detailed_description>
