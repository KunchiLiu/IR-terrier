	<brief_summary>The main objective study determine risk factor etiologies ischemic stroke Korean young adult . Both well-documented risk factor little known life-style relate risk factor life-style habit , psychological distress include occupational distress , perceive stress depression evaluate comparison healthy control use structured questionnaire .

	<brief_title>Stroke Korean Young Adults Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All consecutive patient first-ever ischemic stroke symptom within previous month ask enroll study . Baseline measurement assess patient . Patients without language problem life-threatening condition ask answer structure lifestyle questionnaire . Age- sex-matched control without stroke history recruit among patient ' friend , relatives care-givers patient , request complete questionnaire . People visit hospital health check-ups may also include control . After first assessment , patient follow every 3 month visit outpatient department telephone . Participants ask recurrence stroke , occurrence post-stroke epilepsy , functional outcome modify Rankin Scale . In case patient die , information obtain last practitioner care-giver . Sample size power calculation . The sample size calculate base frequency psychological distress , interest potential risk factor ischemic stroke young . According previous report compare psychological distress ischemic stroke patient healthy controls,8 frequency stress 50.3 % ischemic stroke patient 38.6 % healthy control ; difference 11.7 % . To detect difference power 90 % alpha 0.05 drop-out rate 20 % , sample size least 470 patient 470 control need ( PASS 13 ) . Clinical information . Demographic clinical information collect admission.The data include age , gender , traditional risk factor stroke ( hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia , smoke coronary heart disease ) , medication history ( anti-hypertensives , anti-diabetics , anti-platelets statin ) comorbidities . Hypertension define previous use antihypertensive medication , systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg discharge , diabetes previous use antidiabetic medication fast blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL , hyperlipidemia previous use lipid-lowering agent , fast serum total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL low-density lipoprotein ≥160 mg/dL . With regard cigarette smoking , subject classify current , former , non-smokers . Number pack-years note former current smoker . History coronary heart disease define previous angina pectoris , myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass grafting . Patients also ask comorbid disease . Stroke characteristic laboratory investigation . Data stroke characteristic collect admission , include symptom time onset pre-hospital delay . Severity stroke measure National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) physicians certified Clinical Research Center Stroke Korea . The course disease admission establish , include treatment complication . On discharge , case ischemic stroke classify accord TOAST classification . Modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) Barthel index score also obtain discharge . Laboratory investigation include complete blood cell count , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , C-reactive protein , urinalysis , urine pregnancy test , serum electrolyte , liver function test , renal function test , chest X-ray electrocardiogram check emergency department . Other specific laboratory investigation fast blood glucose , hemoglobin A1C , lipid panel test , thyroid function test , rheumatologic panel test , hypercoagulable panel test , heavy metal test , homocysteine α-galactosidase check day admission , follow overnight fasting . For genetic test CADASIL , investigator ask informed consent . All patient undergo cardiac evaluation admission period , include 24-hour Holter monitoring , transthoracic echocardiography transesophageal echocardiography . Neuroimaging . Brain imaging study interpret one neuro-radiologist center without knowledge clinical information . Standardized magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) sequence recommend participate center . The minimal requirement brain imaging study diffusion-weighted image , FLAIR image , T2-weighted image , gradient echo image . All participant undergo additional vascular image study CT angiography , MR angiography digital subtraction angiography . Based neuroimaging , ischemic stroke location , size vascular territory note . The diagnosis treatment stroke follow standard guideline coordinate center . Life style questionnaire . After make baseline measurement , standardized life style questionnaire provide patient language problem . Age- sex-matched healthy control ask question . The standardized questionnaire request demographic data age , gender , height , weight , abdominal circumference , traditional risk factor , medication history comorbidities . Newly-added demographic data include family history risk factor , ABO type , marital status , live status , economic status , educational status presence pain headache . Marital status classify marry , single , divorced widow . Living status classify alone , spouse , family , non-family member . Economic status classify five category ( 500 USD/month , 500~1500 USD/month , 1500~3000 USD/month , 3000~5000 USD/month &gt; 5000 USD/month ) educational status classify six category ( none , &lt; 6 year , 6-9 year , 9-12 year , 12 year , &gt; 12 year ) . Questions headaches mainly focused migraine : headache character , location , frequency , duration , aura , aggravate factor , medication history family history . Only woman answer question obstetric history term age menarche menopause ( participant experience ) , use oral contraceptive , history hormone replacement therapy , history hysterectomy oophorectomy . Women experience pregnancy ask gravidity , number child , year birth , mode delivery , duration maternal lactation , number miscarriage abortion . Lifestyle factor alcohol consumption , dietary habit , exercise sleep pattern include question . Alcohol consumption define type alcoholic drink , amount per day date consumption begin . Dietary habit include meal frequency consumption salt , meat , vegetable 7 type beverage ( coffee , black tea , oolong tea , green tea , ginseng tea , fruit juice carbonate beverage ) past year . Exercise calculate accord International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) , standardize instrument measure amount exercise.9 Duration sleep , sleep latency , frequency waking-up sleep onset ( WASO ) , snore severity , duration nap , history use sleep pill length time bed without sleep report evaluate sleep pattern . Investigators also add validated Korean version Epworth Sleepiness Scale measure daytime sleepiness,10 question restless leg syndrome . Psychological distress analyze composite measure occupational distress , perceive stress , depression . For occupational distress , occupational status job strain analyze . Not occupation type also period service current previous occupation note evaluate occupational status . Average daily working hour , commute method ( car , bus , subway , walk ) commuting time ( le 30 minute , 30 minute 1 hour , 1 hour 2 hour 2 hour ) also record . Job strain investigate mean job content questionnaire ( JCQ ) validate Korean language . Perceived stress depression answer basis premorbid status . The Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ( CES-D ) Korean version , validate relevant field , use measure subjective status patient control . Statistical analysis . The study comprise 470 case-control pair . Means standard deviation calculate continuous variable , number percentage obtain discrete variable . To assess relationship characteristic ischemic stroke young adult , investigator use pair t-tests continuous variable chi-square test proportion . For nonparametric variable , Mann-Whitney U test use . Conditional logistic regression analysis employ assess difference case match control estimate odds ratio ( ORs ) 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) . Adjusted ORs risk factor derive multivariable logistic regression model . These include collected variable possible significance . Kaplan-Meier survival analysis use estimate cumulative risk mortality , recurrent vascular event post-stroke seizure . Hazard ratios previously-mentioned secondary objective calculate Cox regression analysis , assumption proportionality confirm time-dependent covariate analysis . All statistical analysis two-sided use IBM SPSS 21 .</detailed_description>
