	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Patient Reported Xerostomia After Whole Brain Radiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The parotids traditionally consider organ risk / avoidance structure whole brain radiation . However , patient receive whole brain radiation sometimes complain dry mouth . Investigators hypothesize standard whole brain radiation field cause acute measurable increase xerostomia one month post-radiation , severity xerostomia relate dose received parotids . In study , investigator use validated University Michigan Xerostomia Questionnaire prospectively collect baseline post-radiation xerostomia score 6 month treatment . The radiation dose parotids evaluate assess whether dose-toxicity relationship . Investigators anticipate total accrual 60 patient goal 48 evaluable patient .</detailed_description>
