	<detailed_description>RANK ligand ( RANKL ) , key factor bone remodel metastasis , crucial development mouse mammary gland pregnancy . RANKL function major paracrine effector mitogenic action progesterone mouse human mammary epithelium via receptor RANK role ovarian hormone-dependent expansion regenerative potential mammary stem cell . Pharmacologic inhibition RANKL attenuate development mammary carcinoma inhibits metastatic progression multiple mouse model . In retrospective analysis 601 patient treat GeparTrio study chemotherapy ( TAC ) could demonstrate elevated expression RANK ( immunohistochemical score &gt; 8.5 use N-1H8 antibody Amgen ) find 14.5 % patient overall , significant predominance patient hormone-receptor-negative disease ( 33.7 % vs 6.4 % tumor positive RANK ) . Expression RANK associate high pathological complete response rate ( pCR ) ( 23.0 % vs 12.6 % ) short disease-free overall survival . The ABCSG-18 study show adjuvant denosumab reduces clinical fracture , improve bone health , administer without added toxicity . Moreover denosumab improve disease-free survival postmenopausal woman hormone receptor positive breast cancer . It appear therefore reasonable test denosumab , clinically available antibody RANKL patient hormone-receptor-negative primary breast cancer adjunct neoadjuvant chemotherapy ability increase pCR rate improve outcome relation expression RANK .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Unilateral bilateral primary carcinoma breast , confirm histologically core biopsy . Fineneedle aspiration breast lesion alone sufficient . Incisional biopsy axillary clearance allow . In case bilateral cancer , investigator decide prospectively side evaluated primary endpoint . Tumor lesion breast palpable size 2 cm sonographical size 1 cm maximum diameter . The lesion measurable two dimension , preferably sonography . In case tumor n't measurable sonography , MRI mammography sufficient . In case inflammatory disease , extent inflammation use measurable lesion . Patients must stage cT1c cT4ad disease . In patient multifocal multicentric breast cancer , large lesion measure . Centrally confirm ERnegative PRnegative status . Central pathology include also assessment HER2 , Ki67 , TIL RANK status core biopsy . ER/PR negative define â‰¤1 % stain cell HER2positive define IHC 3+ insitu hybridization ( ISH ) accord ASCOCAP guideline 2013 . LPBC ( lymphocyte predominant breast cancer ) define 50 % stromal tumour infiltrate lymphocyte . Formalinfixed , paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) breast tissue core biopsy therefore send GBG central pathology laboratory prior randomization . Exclusion criterion : Patients stage cT1a , cT1b , M1 . Prior chemotherapy malignancy . Prior radiation therapy breast cancer . History disease influence bone metabolism , osteoporosis , Paget 's disease bone , primary hyperparathyroidism require treatment time randomization consider likely become necessary within subsequent six month . Use bisphosphonates denosumab within past 1 year . Significant dental/oral disease , include prior history current evidence osteonecrosis/ osteomyelitis jaw , active dental jaw condition require oral surgery , nonhealed dental/oral surgery , plan invasive dental procedure course study . Previous malignant disease diseasefree less 5 year ( except CIS cervix nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) . Known suspected congestive heart failure ( &gt; NYHA I ) / coronary heart disease , angina pectoris require antianginal medication , previous history myocardial infarction , evidence transmural infarction ECG , uncontrolled poorly control arterial hypertension ( i.e . BP &gt; 140 / 90 mm Hg treatment two antihypertensive drug ) , rhythm abnormality require permanent treatment , clinically significant valvular heart disease . Currently active infection . Incomplete wound heal . Definite contraindication use corticosteroid .</criteria>
