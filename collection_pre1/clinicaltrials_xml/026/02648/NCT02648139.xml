	<brief_title>A Randomized , Controlled , Double-blind Clinical Trial Surinam Cherry Dentifrice With Anti-gingivitis Properties</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , control , double-blind clinical trial investigate short term clinical efficacy dentifrice contain Eugenia uniflora L. ripe fruit extract prevent gingivitis child . The study consist sample 50 male female subject age 10 12 year old , clinical sign gingivitis . The subject randomly assign one two group . The intervention group comprise 25 subject use dentifrice E. uniflora L. ripe fruit hydroalcoholic extract , three time per day , seven consecutive day . The control group comprise 25 subject use control dentifrice ( fluoride , 1500 ppm triclosan , 0.3 % ) seven consecutive day . The sample size estimate use Fleming 's single-stage procedure phase II trial . With regard primary outcome , response proportion least 50 % define clinically significant . The type I error set 0.05 , type II error set 0.1 . Based value , sample size 20 individual per trial arm would provide 90 % power ( 1-Î² ) detect clinically relevant treatment difference 50 % great compare baseline . Taking consideration attrition rate approximately 20 % , final sample size per trial arm comprise 25 individual . Clinical examination perform baseline seven day dentifrice use . The examination perform single examiner adequately calibrate Kappa statistic 0.8 , consider satisfactory agreement accord Landis &amp; Koch . The examination data record specific clinical chart . The diagnosis gingivitis ( primary outcome ) assess use Gingival Bleeding Index ( GBI ) propose Ainamo Bay . The accumulation biofilm ( secondary outcome ) assess Simplified Oral Hygiene Index ( OHI-S ) describe Greene Vermilion . Prior study , subject instruct correct tooth brush technique receive kit contain toothbrush one dentifrice ( without identification content ) . The dentifrice also mask regard flavor color could identify . In addition , examiner knowledge subject allocation . Thus , study double-blind .
