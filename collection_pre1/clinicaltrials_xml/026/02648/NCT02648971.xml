	<brief_title>Controlled Trial Compare Single Versus Two Portal Knee Arthroscopy Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background , Rationale Context Knee arthroscopy procedure provide minimally invasive method ass status knee joint order repair injury meniscus articular cartilage . In past , two small opening skin ( portal ) require order allow passage arthroscope provide visualization knee joint instrument use complete surgical repair process . However , recent innovation arthroscopy instrumentation result ability use one portal knee arthroscopy procedure arthroscope instrument pass knee joint portal . Both uniportal two portal arthroscopic technique use currently knee arthroscopy procedure Department Orthopaedic Surgery Wake Forest Baptist Health . Objectives This randomize , control clinical trial compare outcomes single portal versus two portal technique patient meniscus articular cartilage pathology . The study hypothesis patient undergo single portal arthroscopy less pain post-operatively , use less pain medication , high International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC ) score six month one year compare patient undergo traditional two portal knee arthroscopy . Methods Measures Design : A randomized , control trial Setting : Academic Medical Center : single study site Wake Forest Baptist Health</detailed_description>
