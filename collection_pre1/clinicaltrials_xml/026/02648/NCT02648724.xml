	<brief_title>Sym015 ( Anti-MET ) Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first part study ( Part 1 , dose-escalation ) , Sym015 evaluate safety tolerability . Additionally , recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) determine . Sym015 give different dose level every second week ( Q2W ) dose schedule . Each patient give one fix dose level . In second part study ( Part 2 , dose-expansion ) , two `` Basket Cohorts '' test see Sym015 effective patient solid tumor specific genetic abnormality call MET-amplification : - Q2W Basket Cohort : Sym015 RP2D Q2W dose schedule . - Q3W Basket Cohort : Sym015 high safe dose test Part 1 every third week ( Q3W ) dose schedule .</detailed_description>
