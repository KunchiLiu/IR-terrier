	<brief_title>Evaluation Maternal Feedback Shorten Pushing Efforts During Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The length second stage ( push stage ) labor highly correlate incidence adverse outcomes mother neonate . More 80 % labor woman US epidural labor pain management . The length second stage labor increase woman receive regional anesthesia pain management labor delivery compare woman without anesthesia . This increase length labor largely due lack maternal sensation result decrease physiologic feedback efficacy maternal expulsive ( push ) effort . Continuous maternal feedback regard fetal decent labor may result effective maternal expulsive effort reduce length second stage improve maternal neonatal outcome . This study assess ability continuous electronic feedback reduce length second stage labor improve maternal fetal outcome . The study device consist modification standard fetal scalp electrode separate apparatus design detect movement fetal head detect movement FSE . As patient push , amount fetal movement measure record . The movement record laptop computer provide optical auditory feedback patient descent fetal head maternal expulsive effort .</detailed_description>
