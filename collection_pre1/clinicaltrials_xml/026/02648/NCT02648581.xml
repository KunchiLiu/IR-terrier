	<detailed_description>Behçet disease ( BD ) chronic systemic inflammatory disorder crossroad autoimmune autoinflammatory syndrome . Two recent large genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) conduct Turkey Japan report association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) interleukin ( IL ) -10 IL-23R/IL-12RB2 gene BD . Interleukin-12 interleukin-23 , cytokine induce naive CD4+ lymphocytes differentiate type 1 helper T cell ( Th1 cell ) type 17 helper T cell ( Th17 cell ) , respectively , identify key mediator BD . Promotion Th1 Th17 responses suppression regulatory T cell correlate BD activity . Due lack etiologic agent , treatment symptomatic without consensus . The goal functional recovery visceral involvement ( eye , central nervous system ) prevention relapse ( ) . The risk BD increase mortality especially case arterial involvement , high morbidity due cumulative sequela ocular neurological involvement . Steroids corner stone antiinflammatory agent administer topically systemically . Relapses frequently see discontinuation steroid , corticodependence frequently observe leading use immunosuppressive drug . Biologic agent selectively block step inflammatory cascade could provide additional therapy BD .</detailed_description>
