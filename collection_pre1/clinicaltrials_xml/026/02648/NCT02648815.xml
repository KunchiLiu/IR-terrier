	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate natural clinical course , diagnostic possibility treatment modality moderately severe ( MSAP ) severe acute pancreatitis ( SAP ) . The management severe acute pancreatitis varies severity depend type complication require treatment . Although universally accept treatment algorithm exists , step-up approach use close monitoring , percutaneous endoscopic drainage , follow minimally invasive video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement demonstrate produce superior outcome traditional open necrosectomy may consider reference standard intervention disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite overall reduce mortality last decade , MSAP SAP devastate disease associate mortality range less 10 % high 85 % , accord various study . The management SAP complicate limited understanding pathogenesis multi-causality disease , uncertainties outcome prediction effective treatment modality . Generally , sterile necrosis manage conservatively majority case low mortality rate ( 12 % ) . However , infection pancreatic necrosis observe 25 % -70 % patient necrotizing disease ; generally accept infected non-vital tissue remove control sepsis . Laparotomy immediate debridement infect necrotic tissue gold standard treatment decade . However , several report show early surgical intervention pancreatic necrosis could result bad prognosis compare case surgery delayed avoid . Therefore , several group worldwide develop new , minimally invasive approach manage infected necrotizing pancreatitis . The applicability techniques depend availability specialized expertise multidisciplinary team dedicate management SAP complication .</detailed_description>
