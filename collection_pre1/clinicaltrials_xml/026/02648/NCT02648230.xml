	<brief_summary>The model physicians measure lack blood flow vessel supply blood heart muscle call Fractional Flow Reserve ( FFR ) . FFR measurement pressure across vessel supply blood heart . These know coronary artery . This study involve compare two FFR wire , St. Jude Medical Pressure Wire ( PW ) ACIST Navvus Microcatheter ( MC ) check accuracy device . FFR allow real-time estimation effect narrow vessel , whereas standard angiography underestimate overestimate narrowing , visualizes contrast ( different area color ) inside vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) measurement pressure wire ( PW ) hyperemic condition become invasive gold standard determine physiologic extent cardiac ischemia , validate several clinical outcome study way optimize case selection PCI . More recently microcatheter ( MC ) -based sensor measurement fractional flow reserve introduce . Small scale in-vivo comparison perform suggest utility approach measure FFR , data limit independently validate . This non-randomized , prospective study design evaluate accuracy MC-based FFR measurement PW standard lesion subject FFR assessment routine clinical practice .</detailed_description>
