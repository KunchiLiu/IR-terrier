	<brief_summary>Anxiety disorder occur 35 % patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) negative effect gait , dyskinesia , freezing , on/off fluctuation , quality life . With Randomized Controlled Trial investigator intend 1 ) develop Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) module anxiety PD 2 ) ass effectiveness module reduce anxiety symptom , 3 ) study effect CBT cerebral connectivity . Effective CBT treatment anxiety provide patient behavioural anxiety management technique give last benefit , anxiety symptom , potentially also motor symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anxiety common patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) negative effect several motor symptom quality life general . So far , treatment , neither pharmacological psychotherapeutic , intend specifically reduce anxiety symptom PD . Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) effective treatment anxiety disorder patient without PD . In PD , CBT effective treatment depression impulse control disorder ( ICD ) . PD patient receive CBT depression report reduction depression comorbid anxiety , also beneficial influence cop quality life , compare PD patient receive clinical monitoring . In addition clinical effectiveness , several study demonstrate therapeutic effect CBT functional neural activity . The two common anxiety disorder patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) : generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) characterize dysfunctional connectivity limbic area ( among amygdala ) frontal cortex . Recent functional imaging study show CBT alter neural correlate affective processing increase functional connectivity limbic frontal cortex . The present study aim study clinical effectiveness CBT module treatment two common anxiety disorder patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) : generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The CBT module base exist module anxiety disorder non-PD patient , module depression ICD PD patient . In addition , investigator aim get insight biological dysfunction associate anxiety PD , well alteration brain structure , brain function cerebral connectivity due CBT . The investigator study biological correlate successful treatment use structural functional magnetic resonance-imaging ( MRI ) scanning . The present study aim study long term clinical effectiveness CBT module , measure change anxiety score 3 6 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
