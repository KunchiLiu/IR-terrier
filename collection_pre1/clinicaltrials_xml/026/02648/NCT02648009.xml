	<brief_summary>The prevalence congestive heart failure ( CHF ) Canada high , represent one health care system 's expensive diagnosis . Despite major advance medicine , mortality morbidity CHF remain great . Currently , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use non-invasive image cardiovascular system enable structure anatomy organ visualize . However , current MRI method limitation assess aid management CHF . A new imaging method recently develop show great promise tool management patient CHF . Rapid image biochemical reaction within myocytes use MRI recently become possible use Dynamic Nuclear Polarization ( DNP ) dissolution method . DNP-dissolution result intravenous contrast agent `` hyperpolarized '' , produce magnetic signal enhance 100,000 fold . The particular agent carbon-13 label pyruvate . In study , demonstrate first 13C-metabolic image human heart , along require hardware data acquisition method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Imaging Heart Using Hyperpolarized ( 13C ) Pyruvate Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For study , heart healthy subject hypertension hypertrophy image use Hyperpolarized Pyruvate 13C Injection . If image successfully obtain , insight heart failure treatment normalize detrimental metabolic change may enable early treatment slow disease progression CHF , ultimately reduce high rate morbidity mortality associate disease . Prior enrolment , participant screen order ensure meet study 's inclusion exclusion criterion MRI eligibility . On day scan , participant intravenous line insert receive glucose drink , prior scan . The reason glucose drink feed versus fast state find give markedly different measurement animal model choice meal would source variability . The metabolic imaging occur shortly drink . For scan , 1.47 g sample [ 1-13C ] -pyruvic acid hyperpolarized use SpinLab polarizer ( General Electric Co. ) . The solid-state sample dissolve concentration 250 mM pyruvate biological pH . A 0.1 mmol/kg dose ( approximately 20 mL ) solution inject intravenous line , follow 25 mL saline flush . The 13C image acquisition begin end injection record data every heartbeat within single breath-hold . Heart rate blood pressure monitor non-invasively , prior participant position within MR scanner . Heart rate continue monitor scan participant monitor Study 's Qualified Investigator medical designate 1 hour post injection . The 13C imaging precede standard cardiovascular MRI workup include breath-hold cine imaging measure ejection fraction LV mass ( ~30 minute scan time ) . All clinical procedure complete SHSC supervision Qualified Investigator , medical designate . Each participant receive follow telephone call 7th day follow procedure ascertain study related adverse event occur . The length study participant single visit require approximately three hour time . The entire study expect take one year result know approximately one year .</detailed_description>
