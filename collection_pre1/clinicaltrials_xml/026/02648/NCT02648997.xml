	<criteria>Have histologically confirm WHO grade II III meningioma progressive recurrent . Metastatic meningioma allow . Participants must fail maximal safe resection radiation therapy . Prior therapy : There limit number prior surgery , radiation therapy , radiosurgery treatment systemically administer therapeutic agent . Patients may treat standard external beam radiation radiosurgery combination , however , interval ≥ 12 week ( 84 day ) must elapse completion radiation therapy start study therapy unless histopathologic confirmation recurrent tumor new enhance tumor outside radiation field ( beyond high dose region 80 % isodose line ) . In addition , must subsequent evidence tumor progression completion radiation therapy ; An interval ≥ 28 day full recovery ( ongoing safety issue ) surgical resection An interval ≥ 7 day stereotactic biopsy ; For prior systemic agent , participant must least 4 week ( 5 halflives , whichever short ) prior cytotoxic chemotherapy ( 6 week nitrosoureas ) biologic therapy . Participants must recover grade ≤ 1 pretreatment baseline clinically significant adverse event related prior therapy ( exclusion include limited alopecia , laboratory value list per inclusion criterion lymphopenia ) ; Be 18 year age day sign informed consent . Have Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 ( Appendix A ) . Participants must demonstrate adequate organ marrow function define ( screen lab perform within 14 day treatment initiation ) : White blood cell ( WBC ) ≥ 2000/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dl AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 x laboratory upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR creatinine clearance ( meas calc ) ≥ 60 mL/min participant creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X ULN ( GFR use place creatinine creatinine clearance ) Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN ( except participant Gilbert 's Syndrome , total bili &lt; 5 X ULN ) Resting baseline oxygen saturation ≥ 92 % rest pulse oximetry MRI ( CT MRI contraindicate ) within 14 day prior start study drug . Corticosteroid dose must stable decrease least 5 day prior scan . If steroid add steroid dose increase date screening MRI CT scan start treatment , new baseline MRI CT require . Ability understand willingness comply schedule visit , treatment schedule , laboratory testing , requirement study , include disease assessment MRI ( CT ) , confirm sign write informed consent document . The effect nivolumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason : Women childbearing potential ( WOCPB ; define Section 3.4 ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour start study therapy ; Women must breastfeed ; WOCPB must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception time enrollment duration treatment study therapy plus 5 halflives study drug plus 30 day ( ovulatory cycle ) total 23 week posttreatment completion . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men sexually active WOCBP must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception duration treatment study drug plus 5 halflives study drug plus 90 day ( duration sperm turnover ) total 31 week posttreatment completion . Investigators shall counsel WOCBP male subject sexually active WOCBP importance pregnancy prevention implication unexpected pregnancy Investigators shall advise WOCBP male subject sexually active WOCBP use highly effective method contraception . Highly effective method contraception failure rate &lt; 1 % per year use consistently correctly . At minimum , subject must agree use two method contraception , one method highly effective method either highly effective less effective list : HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION Male condom spermicide Hormonal method contraception include combined oral contraceptive pill , vaginal ring , injectables , implant , intrauterine device ( IUDs ) Mirena WOCBP subject male subject 's WOCBP partner . Female partner male subject participate study may use hormone base contraceptives one acceptable method contraception since receive study drug Nonhormonal IUDs , ParaGard Tubal ligation Vasectomy Complete Abstinence Complete abstinence define complete avoidance heterosexual intercourse acceptable form contraception study drug . Subjects choose complete abstinence require use second method contraception , female subject must continue pregnancy test . Acceptable alternate method highly effective contraception must discuss event subject choose forego complete abstinence . LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION Diaphragm spermicide Cervical cap spermicide Vaginal sponge Male Condom without spermicide Progestin pill WOCBP subject male subject 's WOCBP partner Female Condom A male female condom must use together NOTE : Azoospermic male WOCBP continuously heterosexually active exempt contraceptive requirement . However , WOCBP participant must still undergo pregnancy test describe . Current plan participation study investigational agent use investigational device . Tumors primarily localize brainstem spinal cord ; Evidence intratumoral peritumoral hemorrhage baseline MRI scan grade ≤ 1 either postoperative stable least 2 consecutive MRI scan ; Prior Therapy : Prior treatment systemic immunosuppressive treatment , aside systemic dexamethasone therapy cerebral edema , methotrexate , chloroquine , azathioprine , etc . within 3 month start study therapy ; Prior treatment interstitial brachytherapy within 6 month start study therapy ; Previous treatment PD1 PDL1 direct therapy ; Surgical procedure ( include open biopsy , surgical resection , wound revision , major surgery involve entry body cavity ) significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior first study treatment , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study ; Minor surgical procedure ( eg , stereotactic biopsy within 7 day first study treatment ; placement vascular access device within 2 day first study treatment ) ; Other Meds : Participants receive investigational agent . Immunosuppressive medication / steroid : Subject must require high dose systemic corticosteroid define dexamethasone &gt; 4 mg/day bioequivalent least 3 consecutive day within 2 week prior Day 1of study therapy ; Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . Subjects permit use topical , ocular , intraarticular , intranasal , inhalational corticosteroid ( minimal systemic absorption ) . Physiologic replacement dos systemic corticosteroid permit , even &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent . A brief course corticosteroid prophylaxis ( eg , contrast dye allergy ) treatment nonautoimmune condition ( eg , delayedtype hypersensitivity reaction cause contact allergen ) permit . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day prior first dose study drug ; seasonal influenza vaccination permit exclude nasal spray formulation ; No concurrent treatment another clinical trial . Supportive care trial non treatment trial , e.g . quality life , allow ; Concomitant Medical Illnesses : Uncontrolled intercurrent illness , includingbut limit : Known additional malignancy progress require active treatment within 3 year start study drug . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy ; Has evidence interstitial lung disease active , noninfectious pneumonitis ; Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , impair ability subject receive protocol therapy , interfere interpretation study result example include limited symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement ; Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment within past 3 month document history clinically severe autoimmune disease , syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . Subjects vitiligo , type 1 diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger resolve childhood asthma/atopy would exceptions rule . Subjects require intermittent use bronchodilator local steroid injection would exclude study . Subjects hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement Sjorgen 's syndrome exclude study ; Has active infection require intravenous therapy ; Positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBV sAg ) detectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV RNA ) indicate acute chronic infection Medical History : History intracranial abscess within 6 month prior start study therapy ; Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) ; NOTE : HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction Nivolumab . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . History allergy study drug component History severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody ; Prisoners participant involuntarily incarcerate ; Pregnant woman exclude study Nivolumab agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Nivolumab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Nivolumab .</criteria>
