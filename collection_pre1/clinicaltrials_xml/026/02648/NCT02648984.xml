	<brief_summary>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) patient congenital heart disease usually develop secondary chronic volume overload pulmonary circulation follow leave right shunt . This overload lead elevate pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) later increase pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) , lead right ventricular dysfunction , considerable morbidity even mortality . Since PAH nowadays mostly detect symptom occur PAP elevate , disease already evolve advanced stage treatment often initiate late . Our research group standardize technique detection early pulmonary vascular disease bicycle stress echocardiography . The investigator aim assess exercise technique group patient ventricular septal defect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) patient congenital heart disease usually develop secondary chronic volume overload pulmonary circulation follow leave right shunt . This overload lead elevate pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) later increase pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) . PAH may lead right ventricular right atrial dysfunction , may implicate considerable morbidity even mortality . Since PAH nowadays mostly detect symptom occur PAP elevate , disease already evolve advanced stage treatment often initiate late . Our research group standardize technique detection early pulmonary vascular disease bicycle stress echocardiography . Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension recognise clinical entity , include current guideline pulmonary hypertension . Further research area might imply need revision current PAH detection treatment strategy . By perform stress echocardiography cardiopulmonary exercise testing , investigator want reach follow objective : - To answer question whether abnormal increase PAP exercise , see patient late atrial septal defect ( ASD ) type secundum closure , also present congenital heart disease ( CHD ) patient treat shunt lesion . - To apply early detection technique broad population CHD patient well define predictive value elevate PVR exercise .</detailed_description>
