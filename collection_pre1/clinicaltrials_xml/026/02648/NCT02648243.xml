	<brief_summary>In Qatar , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) become leading cause morbidity mortality past two decade . Between 1991 2010 , total 16,736 patient admit ACS ( Acute Coronary Syndrome ) Qatar . Despite use percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) , pharmacological agent acutely reduce vascular risk , ACS patient high risk cardiovascular event . Consequently , secondary cardiovascular risk reduction therapy need CAD ( Coronary Artery Disease ) patient . Clinical practice guideline recommend follow ACS , patient receive indefinite treatment aspirin , beta blocker , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) alternatively angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) statin . Less 80 % ACS patient Qatar use quadruple combination discharge . This create significant opportunity pharmacist improve CVD management outcomes Qatar . Nothing known impact Qatar clinical pharmacist direct patient-care team member discharge post-discharge short-term long-term outcome ACS patient . The propose study aim determine impact . The investigator hypothesize clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention consist medication reconciliation counsel discharge tailor follow-up post-discharge decrease hospital readmission , emergency department ( ED ) visit all-cause mortality 3 month , 6 month 12 month hospital discharge compare control arm pharmacist deliver intervention discharge among ACS patient . The investigator also hypothesize effect intervention increase patient ' adherence evidence-based secondary prevention medication CAD ( Coronary Artery Disease ) , patient satisfaction pharmacy service . Besides , intervention reduce treatment burden patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nothing know impact Qatar clinical pharmacist direct patient-care team member discharge post-discharge short-term long-term outcome patient ACS Heart Hospital Qatar . This research project aim determine . The investigator hypothesize clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention consist medication reconciliation counsel discharge tailor follow-up post-discharge decrease hospital readmission , emergency department ( ED ) visit all-cause mortality 3 month , 6 month 12 month hospital discharge compare control arm pharmacist deliver intervention discharge among ACS patient . The investigator also hypothesize effect intervention increase patient ' adherence evidence-based secondary prevention medication CAD , patient satisfaction pharmacy service . besides , intervention reduce treatment burden patient . Study objectives : 1 . To evaluate effectiveness clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention discharge tailor follow-up post-discharge decrease hospital readmission , ED visit mortality ACS patient . 2 . To evaluate effectiveness intervention improve patient adherence evidence-based secondary prevention CAD medication . 3 . To study effect intervention reduce burden treatment patient . 4 . To assess effect intervention increase patient satisfaction pharmacy service Heart Hospital Qatar .</detailed_description>
