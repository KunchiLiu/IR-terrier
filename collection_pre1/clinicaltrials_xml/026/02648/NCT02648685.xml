	<brief_title>The Study Investigate Contribution Fasting Post-prandial Blood Glucose Overall Glycaemia Subjects With Normal Glycaemic Metabolism T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The current evidence show hyperglycemia one important cause atherosclerosis。In DCCT study [ 1 ] , compare conventional therapy group ( HbA1c &lt; 9％ ) , risk retinopathy , kidney disease neuropathy significantly reduce intensive therapy group ( HbA1c &lt; 7％ ) . The EDIC study [ 2 ] show reduction ( 42 % p=0.02 ) incidence cardiovascular event intensive therapy group risk nonfatal myocardial infarction , stroke , cardiovascular death reduce 57 % . ( p=0.02 ) . Based evidence , could tell continue cardiovascular benefit early intensive glucose control evident among T1DM patient . Similarly , UKPDS study [ 3,4 ] demonstrate newly diagnose T2DM patient , incidence microvascular complication 25 % low cardiovascular complication ( include fatal nonfatal MI ) 16 % lower intensive glucose control group coincident conclusion EDIC study . The blood glucose diabetes patient consist 3 parts：normal basal blood glucose , basal hyperglycemia postprandial hyperglycemia increase base basal hyperglycemia [ 5 ] . HbA1c standard indicator glucose metabolism determine Basal blood glucose ( BBG ) post prandial glucose ( PPG ) level . HbA1c risk factor diabetes vascular lesion become consensus UKPDS study show increase HbA1c fast blood glucose level maight associate regression beta cell function , basal hyperglycemia major cause diabetic cardiovascular complication [ 6 ] . Most previous study focus HbA1c FPG level determine control blood glucose [ 7,8 ] .But relationship PPG increase diabetes complication gradually value . Evidence show PPG HbA1c main predictor cardiovascular event all-cause mortality T2DM [ 9-11 ] . The contribution basal post-prandial blood glucose overall glycaemia one point investigate glucose metabolism impair . Wenhui Li [ 12 ] et al find relationship fasting , post-absorption blood glucose HbA1c level closely PPG . Especially blood glucose 8:00 AM closely related HbA1c ( r=0.84 ) , The A1c-Derived Average Glucose study ( ADAG ) [ 13 ] also get similar conclusion . However , study show relationship PPG HbA1c much close [ 14 ] . The main reason lead argument lack accept accurate method ass contribution basal post-prandial blood glucose overall glycaemia , contribution associate choice therapeutic strategy . Currently , study do investigate newly diagnose treatment-naive type 2 diabetes , Only Peter R , et al . find contribution fast hyperglycemia derive standardized meal test excess hyperglycemia increase glycaemia control deteriorate , become dominant HbA1c excess 7.0 % . While T2DM patient treat OAD , different researcher conclude difference , Monnier et al [ 5,16 ] find T2DM patient treat OAD , HbA1c ≤7 % , relative contribution PPG around 69.7 % , proportion decrease gradually accompany increase HbA1c . When HbA1c≥10.2 % , contribution PPG 30.5 % ; Kikuchi et al [ 17 ] conclude similar result Monnier T2DM patient Japan . Riddle et al [ 18 ] find HbA1c≤8 % , PPG contribute HbA1c , deterioration blood glucose , relative contribution FPG increase 70 % . However , blood glucose fluctuation affect many factor disease duration , sex , diet , food cook method race [ 19 ] . Our previous study find compare NGT , intra-day blood glucose fluctuation similar IGR patient , already occur . In newly diagnose type 2 diabetic patient , inter-day intra-day blood glucose fluctuation significantly increase , besides , effect different ratio carbohydrate diet different [ 20-24 ] For Asian yellow , less research conclusion consistent . Japanese scholar Kikuchi [ 17 ] obtain similar conclusion Monnier , study do Taiwanese researcher [ 25 ] show good blood glucose control patient , relative contribution PPG 70 % , blood glucose control deterioration , FPG PPG effect similar , 50 % . Until , research contribution BBG PPG HbA1c less , result different , May different research method study population . At present , research use 6.1mmol/L ( WHO criteria ) 5.6mmol/L ( ADA criterion ) normal FBG level ( WHO criteria ) calculate fast postprandial hyperglycemia , accord blood glucose fluctuation curve NGT population , BBG PPG contribution HbA1c might underestimated overestimate . In addition , Peter Monnier use MTT method would cause difference result T2DM patient real world .Peter , Monnier , Riddle Kikuchi monitor blood glucose collect pre postprandial blood sample frequently SMBG . The contribution postprandial glucose HbA1c underestimated . As continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) become widely use , consider well method evaluate contribution BBG PPG HbA1c minimize bias result research methodology [ 25 ] . There China mainland data show contribution BBG PBG HbA1c T2DM patient treat OADs use CGM method . Therefore study aim investigate contribution BBG PBG HbA1c Chinese T2DM patient treat OADs use CGMS . It 's expect generate evidence support concept individualized therapy patient uncontrolled OADs . Objectives Primary objective investigate relative contribution BBG PBG overall glycaemia T2DM OAD . The secondary investigate absolute contribution BBG PBG overall glycaemia T2DM OAD treatment , investigate correlation overall glycaemia exposure HbA1c regression equation HbA1c BBG PBG . Sample size According MONNIER ' research , contribution PBG whole day hyperglycemia use 6.1mmol/L base line is： HbA1c＜7.3 % ， 69.7 % ±4.18 % ( n=58 ) ； HbA1c ( 7.3-8.4 % ) ，51.34±4.18 % ( n=58 ) ； HbA1c ( 8.5-9.2 % ) ，44.18±3.58 % ( n=58 ) ； HbA1c ( 9.3-10.2 % ) ，40.60±4.78 % ( n=58 ) ； HbA1c＞10.2 % ，30.5 % ±3.58 % ( n=58 ) ； If 5 group , mean CSS 854.94 , SD 33.55 , α=0.05.After enter SAS 8.01 software , every group 22 size totally 110 case 5 group . So 132 case enrol ( rate dropout withdraw 20 % , case need 110+110×0.2=132 ) . One-Way ANOVA # Treatments = 5 CSS Means = 854.94 Standard Deviation = 33.55 Alpha = 0.05 N per Power Group 0.800 17 0.850 19 0.900 22 （SAS 8.01 software） Because exploratory research , justified sample : T2DM subject : primary endpoint relative contribution FBG . The contribution calculate individual subject . A sample size 60 group produce two-sided 95 % confidence interval relative contribution FBG precision approximately ±6.5 % estimate standard deviation 25 % ( refer previous study ) , total subject five group 300 . Normal glycaemic subject : sample size 100 normal glycaemic subject produce two-sided 95 % confidence interval AUC precision approximately ±0.08d∙mmol∙L-1when estimate standard deviation 0.4d∙mmol∙L-1 ( refer previous study ) . Number subject per treatment arm : N ( normal glycaemic group ) =100 ; N ( T2DM OADs ) =300 Cases one follow reason remove - Misdiagnos - No medication regular medication - Irregular diet - No test record - Using drug might interfere glucose metabolism mislead result . Study design This single center , two group , cross sectional study . - One group consist normal glycaemic subject , N=100 . - One group consist T2DM subject treat OADs , N= 300 , divide 5 sub-groups HbA1c level sub-group include 60 subject ( HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % , 6.5-7.0 % , 7.0-8.0 % , 8.0-9.0 % , &gt; =9.0 % ) CGMS use collect blood glucose data . The normal glycaemic subject receive treatment study . The T2DM subject maintain previous OADs treatment new treatment add study . Relative absolute contribution calculate two way : - Refer method Monnier Riddle calculate contribution WHO normal FBG cut point 6.1 mmol/L - AUC 24h total high glycaemia=the area curve FBG 6.1 mmol/L - AUCPPG= ( area pre-prandial glucose 4-h period meal ) X3 meal - AUC BBG= AUC 24h total high glycaemia - AUCPPG - Using data group normal glycaemic subject basis calculate contribution ( need select normal FBG cut-off point , therefore avoid overestimate underestimated contribution FBG due conflict different FBG cut-off point western guideline China guideline 5.6 mmol/L 6.1 mmol/L respectively ) - AUC24h NGT total=the area curve glucose 0 mmol/L - AUC 24h T2DM total= area curve glucose 0 mmol/L - Total high glycaemia= AUC 24h total high glycaemia = AUC 24hT2DM total -AUC 24h NGT total - AUC PPG== ( area post-prandial glucose 4-h period meal ) X3 meal T2DM patient - AUC BBG= AUC 24h total high glycaemia- AUCPPG - Relative glucose contribution calculation : - Relative contribution BBG= AUC BBG/ AUC 24h total high glycaemia X100 % - Relative contribution PPG= AUC PPG/ AUC 24h total high glycaemiaX100 % - Absolute glucose contribution calculation : - Refer Monnier , et al : Absolute PBG contribution= HbA1c× ( AUCPBG/AUCtotal ) - Refer Peter , al : Absolute PBG contribution= [ （mean HbA1c-T2DM - mean HbA1c-NGT）×AUCPBG/ AUCtotal ] ; Absolute BBG contribution= [ （mean HbA1c-T2DM - mean HbA1c-NGT）×（AUCtotal-AUCPBG）/ AUCtotal ] The contribution ADA normal FBG cut point 5.6mmol/L .
