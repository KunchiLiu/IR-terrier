In clinical , 20 % patient exhibit stable viral suppression HAART still fail achieve sufficient immune reconstitution often experience increase risk opportunistic infection . Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized donor peripheral-blood stem cell base HLA-mismatched allogeneic transplantation demonstrate boost host immunity tumor promote hemopoiesis without acute graft-versus-host disease .

	<detailed_description>Chronic HIV-1 infection generally characterize progressive CD4 T-cell depletion associate increase immune activation risk opportunistic infection . HAART effectively suppress viral replication , lead significant immune recovery dramatic reduction incidence AIDS-defining event . However , approximately 20 % individual exhibit stable viral suppression HAART still fail achieve sufficient immune reconstitution consider immune nonresponders ( INRs ) . These INRs often experience increase risk opportunistic infection shorter life expectancy compare match immune responders.Therefore , efficiently treat immune nonresponders become one difficult challenge clinic . Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) -mobilized donor peripheral-blood stem cell ( GPBSCs ) heterogeneous population immune cell potential role immunomodulation hemopoiesis . GPBSCs base HLA-mismatched allogeneic transplantation recently emerge promising candidate cell-based immunotherapy . Infusion GPBSCs demonstrate boost host immunity tumor promote hemopoiesis cohort patient acute myeloid leukemia . It represent novel treatment allogenic adoptive cell therapy ( AACT ) several character : Before transplantation , donor recipient HLA-A , -B , -C , -DRB1 , -DQB1 locus type intermediate resolution polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer method . All AACT-treated INR patient related donor HLA mismatch . Donors match HLA locus match red blood cell ( RBC ) type first choose . However , donor sex , age , characteristic consider priority.The donor subcutaneously inject 5Î¼g/kg G-CSF twice day 5 day peripheral mononuclear cell carry CS-3000S cell separator . Donor cell divide aliquot cryopreserved liquid nitrogen , freshly collect cell use first course . The purpose study investigate safety initial efficacy AACT INR patient . 20 INR patient receive i.v . transfusion 2.0-3.0*10E8 cells/kg GPBSCs treat group 20 INR patient transfuse placebo without GPBSCs control group . All 40 receive routine management AIDS . During 24- 48-week follow , evaluation safety efficacy undergone help establish innovative cell-based therapy treatment disease .</detailed_description>
