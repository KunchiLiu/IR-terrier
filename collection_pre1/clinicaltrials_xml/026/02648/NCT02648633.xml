	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery With Nivolumab Valproate Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immune checkpoint inhibitor potential treat wide range diverse cancer . Of particular interest researcher PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction , major pathway many cancer hijack order suppress immune control . Anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab show strong potential treat many type cancer include glioblastoma , common lethal brain cancer . This study examine mean focus immune response glioblastoma combine stereotactic `` gamma knife '' radiosurgery nivolumab . The rationale behind intervention radiation therapy enhance immune response rate provide additional tumor antigen die cell . Additionally , study investigator Johns Hopkins indicate histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor may boost anti-cancer efficacy PD-1 antibody like nivolumab . Valproate , class I HDAC inhibitor , use concurrently nivolumab goal enhance effect nivolumab radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
