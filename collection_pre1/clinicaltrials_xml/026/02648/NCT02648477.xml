	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pembrolizumab doxorubicin hydrochloride work compare pembrolizumab anti-estrogen therapy ( anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane ) treat patient triple-negative hormone-receptor positive breast cancer spread primary site ( place start ) place body . Pembrolizumab antibody drug block molecule call program death ( PD ) -1 . PD-1 molecule shut body 's immune response prevents immune system attack cancer . Doxorubicin hydrochloride drug use chemotherapy work stop growth tumor cell stop divide cause die . Anti-estrogen therapy , include anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane , lower estrogen level body , may help treat cancer hormone receptor-positive . Giving pembrolizumab together standard treatment either doxorubicin hydrochloride ( triple-negative cancer ) anti-estrogen therapy ( hormone receptor-positive cancer ) may effective treatment type breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy ( overall response rate ) MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) doxorubicin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) patient stage IV triple negative breast cancer . II . To evaluate efficacy ( overall response rate ) MK-3475 oral aromatase inhibitor patient stage IV hormone receptor positive ( HR+ ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative ( HER2- ) breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical benefit rate ( lack progression &gt; 24 week ) , duration response , time-to-treatment failure , progression-free survival , overall survival triple negative ( TN ) stage IV breast cancer patient base primarily Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 immune-related ( ir ) RECIST . II . To assess feasibility toxicity . III . To assess clinical benefit rate ( lack progression &gt; 24 week ) , duration response , time-to-treatment failure , progression-free survival , overall survival patient stage IV HR+ breast cancer base primarily RECIST 1.1 , irRECIST . IV . To assess feasibility toxicity . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To procure serial tumor ( primary metastatic ) blood ( cellular serum/plasma ) sample analyze well understand cellular humoral immune response correlate predictor clinical benefit , lead optimize selection target population future phase II subsequent phase III randomize prospective trial . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . COHORT 1 ( TRIPLE-NEGATIVE ) : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 doxorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course , continue 24 month pembrolizumab alone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT 2 ( HORMONE/HER2+ ) : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 aromatase inhibitor ( exemestane , anastrozole , letrozole ) orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In arm , patient stop pembrolizumab stable disease well may receive additional pembrolizumab therapy 1 year progress stop study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day end treatment every 8-12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
