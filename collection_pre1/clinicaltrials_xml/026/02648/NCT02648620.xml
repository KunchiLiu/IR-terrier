	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow criterion participate trial : Subject ≥ 18 year . Subject lifestylelimiting claudication rest pain Rutherford classification 2 , 3 4 . Subject provide write informed consent . Subject willing comply study followup requirement . A de novo target lesion femoral popliteal artery . Target lesion must angiographic evidence ≥ 50 % stenosis operator visual estimate . Target lesion must ≤ 90 mm length ( one long lesion multiple serial lesion ) operator visual estimate . Note : Multiple serial lesion allow provide treated single lesion one balloon . Target vessel must reference vessel diameter ( RVD ) 4 mm 6 mm operator visual estimate . After predilatation , target lesion ≤ 70 % residual stenosis , absence flow limit dissection treatable single balloon . A patent inflow artery free significant stenosis ( ≥ 50 % stenosis ) confirm angiography . At least one patent native outflow artery ankle foot , free significant stenosis ( ≥ 50 % stenosis ) confirm angiography . Subjects exclude trial follow criterion meet : Subject acute limb ischemia . Subject Rutherford classification 0 , 1 , 5 6 . Subject previously underwent low extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) use DCB within 3 month . Subject prior vascular intervention within 2 week plan study index procedure subject plan vascular intervention within 30 day study index procedure . Subject pregnant and/or breastfeed intend become pregnant time study OR subject male intend father child within 60 day index procedure . Life expectancy le 2 year . Subject know allergy contrast medium adequately premedicated . Subject allergic ALL antiplatelet treatment . Subject impaired renal function ( i.e . serum creatinine level ≥ 2.5 mg/dl ) . Subject dialysis dependent . Subject receive immunosuppressant therapy . Subject know suspect active infection time index procedure . Subject platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 &gt; 700,000/mm3 . Subject white blood cell ( WBC ) count &lt; 3,000/mm3 . Subject history gastrointestinal hemorrhage require transfusion within 3 month prior index procedure . Subject diagnose coagulopathy precludes treatment systemic anticoagulation and/or dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) . Subject unable tolerate blood transfusion religious beliefs reason . Subject unwilling unable comply procedure specify protocol difficulty inability return followup visit specify protocol . Subject know incarcerated , mentally incompetent and/or alcohol drug abuser . Subject participate another investigational drug medical device study complete primary endpoint ( ) evaluation clinically interfere endpoint study , subject plan participate study prior completion study . Subject major surgical interventional procedure unrelated study within 30 day prior study planned surgical interventional procedure within 30 day entry study . Previous intervention lesion site include previous stenting within 3 cm target lesion previous bypass surgery target lesion . Previous treatment target vessel thrombolysis surgery . Severe concentric calcification target lesion . Target lesion involve aneurysm adjacent aneurysm . Target lesion require treatment alternative therapy stenting , laser , atherectomy , cryoplasty , brachytherapy reentry device . Significant vessel tortuosity parameter prohibit access target lesion . Presence thrombus target vessel . Iliac inflow disease require treatment , unless iliac artery disease successfully treat first index procedure . Success define ≤ 30 % residual diameter stenosis without death major complication . Absence least one patent native outflow artery . Presence aortic , iliac femoral artificial graft . Failure cross target lesion guide wire . Successful cross target lesion occur tip guide wire distal target lesion without occurrence flowlimiting dissection perforation . Failure successfully predilate target lesion . Successful predilatation define residual stenosis ≤ 70 % flowlimiting dissection .</criteria>
