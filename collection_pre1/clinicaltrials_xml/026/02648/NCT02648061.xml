	<brief_summary>Extensive research exist cardio-pulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) chance successful return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) improve . Unfortunately , overall prognosis ROSC improve much in-hospital mortality still report 50 70 % . The `` post-resuscitation disease '' call `` post-cardiac arrest syndrome '' ( PCAS ) comprise 1 ) brain injury , 2 ) myocardial dysfunction 3 ) systemic ischemia reperfusion . Treatment patient cardiac arrest often follow guideline primarily develop treatment septic shock . It still uncertain whether optimal way deliver circulatory support cardiac arrest . There lack study assess relationship inflammatory response measure inflammatory biomarkers circulatory failure PCAS . In study detailed description give clinical trajectory circulation inflammatory response first 5 day cardiac arrest , investigate whether pattern circulatory inflammatory response may predictive deterioration clinical state .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study obtain longitudinally advanced hemodynamic observation high resolution acute phase post cardiac arrest syndrome ( PCAS ) , analyze detail clinical transition related circulatory failure . The study also analyze relationship inflammatory biomarkers circulatory failure PCAS kinetics hemodynamics associated standard intervention intensive care unit ( ICU ) .</detailed_description>
