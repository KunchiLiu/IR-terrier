	<brief_summary>Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia serious frequent infection immunocompromised patient , whose evolution potentially fatal untreated . It common opportunistic infection classify patient infected human immunodeficiency virus ( human immunodeficiency virus + ) stage acquire immune deficiency syndrome . Data french Institute Health Watch show 2011 31 % 1400 case acquire immune deficiency syndrome reveal Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia . Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia also increasingly concern immunocompromised human immunodeficiency virus negative patient , due increase use immunosuppressive therapy ( include corticosteroid ) , anticancer cytostatics biotherapies , context graft , transplant , also autoimmune inflammatory chronic disease . Recent data show number case occur patient Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia human immunodeficiency virus - France high case occur Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia + . The severity Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia increase patient human immunodeficiency virus - , evolution faster , mechanical ventilation often require high mortality , require fast early diagnosis . Routine diagnosis relies detection fungus bronchoalveolar lavage , use stain ( May Grunwald Giemsa immunofluorescence ) Polymerase Chain Reaction . Polymerase Chain Reaction provide diagnostic gain immunocompromised patient infected human immunodeficiency virus may present pejorative table quickly despite low fungal burden . However , deoxyribonucleic acid fungus sometimes detect absence scalable Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia , show pulmonary colonization Pneumocystis jirovecii . It therefore important improve positive predictive value Pneumocystis Polymerase Chain Reaction , guide management optimal patient . In work , investigator propose evaluate Polymerase Chain Reaction oropharyngeal rinse , non-invasive sample therefore probably less often positive specific active infection . The investigator develop quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction identify fungal load threshold number copy / mL diagnose Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia well positive predictive value .</brief_summary>
