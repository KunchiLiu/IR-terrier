	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) weekly dose CRLX101 ( monotherapy ; ( Schedule 1 ) combination bevacizumab every 2 week ( Schedule 2 ) weekly 3 week / 1 week schedule combination mFOLFOX6 ( Schedule 3 ) affirm dose future clinical study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternative Dosing CRLX101 Alone , With Avastin With mFOLFOX6 Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , dose escalation study . Subjects enrol Schedule 1 receive weekly CRLX101 alone . The start dose Schedule 1 12 mg/m^2 next dose level 15 mg/m^2 ( 10 mg/m^2 12 mg/m^2 well tolerate ) . No dose level Schedule 1 explore . Subjects enrol Schedule 2 receive weekly CRLX101 combination bi-weekly bevacizumab ( 10 mg/kg ) The start dose Schedule 2 12 mg/m^ next dose 15 mg/m^2 . No dose level Schedule 2 explore Subjects enrol Schedule 3 receive weekly CRLX101 3 every 4 week combination bi-weekly mFOLFOX6 ( oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 , leucovorin 400 mg/m^2 5FU ( fluorouracil ) 400 mg/m^2 bolus follow 2400 mg/m^2 continuous infusion ) . The start dose Schedule 3 12 mg/m^2 next dose 15 mg/m^2 . In absence dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) additional subject may enrol ( expansion cohort ) , intermediate low dose level follow consultation Investigator Sponsor . Enrollment 6-8 subject occur cohort 3 Schedules . The MTD define high dose level few 2 6 subject experience DLT . RP2D select base overall tolerability data subject treat different dose cohort study . No intra-patient dose escalation allow . Approximately 61 evaluable subject anticipate enrol : 15 subject Schedule 1 , 15 subject Schedule 2 approximately 31 subject anticipate Schedule 3 ( approximately 16 dose escalation cohort 15 expansion cohort ) . The exact number subject dependent actual number subject enrol per cohort number cohort investigate .</detailed_description>
