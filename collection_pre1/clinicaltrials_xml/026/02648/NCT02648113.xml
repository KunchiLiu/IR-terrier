	<detailed_description>Anemia frequent patient myocardial infarction ( MI ) . The antiplatelet anticoagulant agent use MI treatment increase risk bleeding , turn increase risk ischemia mortality . Anemia independent predictor cardiac event set . In `` FAST-MI 2010 '' nationwide registry , prevalence anemia ( define Hb &lt; 10g/dL ) admission 3 % impacted mortality . Whether risk overcome transfusion debate . In theory , transfusion increase oxygen delivery myocardium . However , recent data suggest oxygen delivery increase patient receive transfusion , red blood cell rapidly deplete nitric oxide storage , conversely , transfusion may increase platelet activation aggregation consequence appear potentially even deleterious patient cardiovascular disease . In general population without cardiovascular disease medical surgical patient , role liberal v restrictive transfusion strategy explore series randomize trial , lead consensus withhold blood transfusion threshold 7 8 g/dl hemoglobin reach . Among patient myocardial infarction , however , deleterious consequence anemia risk transfusion may great , lead linger uncertainty regard role liberal v restrictive transfusion strategy set . The clinical data observational contradictory . Conversely , large meta-analysis ( &gt; 200 000 patient ) report high risk mortality recurrent MI MI patient receive transfusion . More recently , careful observational study show majority patient undergo blood transfusion match non-transfused patient due markedly different clinical profile , indicate observational study reliable establish benefit risks transfusion hopelessly influenced selection bias . These result strongly highlight need randomize trial establish role transfusion acute MI , call randomize trial echo several thought leader field recent year . Two small randomize trial ( respectively 45 110 patient ) compare liberal vs. restrictive transfusion strategy MI show clear difference clinical outcome underpowered . The guideline regard management anemia set European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) guideline non-ST segment elevation - acute coronary syndrome ( NSTE-ACS ) , advise blood transfusion hemodynamic status compromise hemoglobin level &lt; 7g/dL . As result , wide variation clinical practice . There therefore equipoise regard transfusion strategy best . Hypothesis : We hypothesize `` restrictive '' transfusion strategy ( trigger Hb &lt; = 8 g/ dL ) clinically non-inferior `` liberal '' transfusion strategy ( trigger Hb &lt; = 10g/ dL ) less costly . Main objective : The main objective study compare cost-effectiveness restrictive ( trigger Hb &lt; = 8 g/ dL ) v liberal ( trigger Hb &lt; = 10g/ dL ) red blood transfusion strategy patient acute MI anemia ( 7g /dL &lt; Hb &lt; = 10g / dL ) . Secondary objective ( ) : 1 . The key secondary objective perform cost-utility analyse 30-days 1 year . 2 . The main clinical objective determine whether restrictive transfusion strategy clinically non-inferior liberal transfusion strategy term major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) 30 day , define composite all-cause death , nonfatal stroke , nonfatal recurrent MI , emergency revascularization prompt ischemia . 2 . A tertiary objective compare major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) 1 year , since impact transfusion strategy MACE may delay , conversely , initial benefit either strategy may become lose first year .</detailed_description>
