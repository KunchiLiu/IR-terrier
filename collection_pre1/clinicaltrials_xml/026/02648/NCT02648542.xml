	<brief_title>The Effects Compensatory Auditory Stimulation Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Tinnitus Perception</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tinnitus refers persistent `` ring ear '' absence external sound . For individual tinnitus disable . Most tinnitus idiopathic origin currently reliable treatment option available . Existing approach , hear aid , counseling , noise mask typically provide partial relief minority patient . Newer exploratory method include tailored auditory stimulation various brain stimulation technique . While technique show great promise subset subject ( maybe 1/3 ) , hard anticipate , , benefit give patient . Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) explore number neurological condition , effective paired form training ( e.g . motor rehab stroke ) . For tinnitus however treatment modality test isolation . The purpose pilot study explore benefit combine tailored compensatory auditory stimulation tDCS . There widespread consensus research community tinnitus originate peripheral hearing deficit , maladaptive central plastic mechanism subsequently lead tinnitus percept . Most individual tinnitus audiometric evidence hearing loss . Our hypothesis reduce input auditory pathway lead increase sensitivity ( auditory gain ) finally aberrant activity frequency band hearing loss . In view , auditory stimulation compensates reduce input potentially revert maladaptive plasticity.This consistent report benefit hear aid tailor auditory stimulation . Our hypothesis tDCS boost adaptation induce compensatory auditory stimulation reduce strength phantom percept .</detailed_description>
