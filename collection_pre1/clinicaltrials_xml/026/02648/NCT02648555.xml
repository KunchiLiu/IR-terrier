	<detailed_description>Tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) well-known role coagulation pathway . tPA convert plasminogen plasmin . Plasmin dissolve fibrin clot , thus limit thrombus formation site vascular injury . In extravascular compartment , tPA pivotal mediator tissue formation remodel . Due proteolytic activity , tPA participates process diverse embryo adhesion , placental angiogenesis vasculogenesis , neuronal plasticity . Embryo adhesion placentation , example , depend tPA-mediated activation brain-derived neurotrophic factor , vascular endothelial growth factor growth factor , formation hemidesmosomes , degradation extracellular matrix basement membrane , either directly activate matrix metalloproteinases . Assuming low tPA activity would impair blood clot dissolution placentation , investigator postulate patient consecutive first-trimester abortion would high prevalence severe dysmenorrhea , accompany passage large clot . In 2011 , investigator assess prevalence severe dysmenorrhea early adolescence two group . The first one make woman ≥ 2 consecutive first-trimester abortion , , woman ≥ 2 living birth , loss preterm delivery . Severe dysmenorrhea define suprapubic menstrual cramp , intense enough cause repeat absenteeism school faint absence analgesia . Early adolescent unlikely use contraceptive , become pregnant , two situation may reduce pain . In study , severe dysmenorrhea increase chance consecutive first-trimester miscarriage sevenfold ( 95 % Confidence Interval : 3.4 14.1 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . Since glucose insulin stimulate release major tPA inhibitor endothelial cell - plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI ) -1 - investigator hypothesize lifestyle intervention proven effective maintain glucose insulin level within normal range would increase take home baby rate woman undergo assisted reproduction . The protocol already test Brazilian tertiary care center woman unexplained consecutive first-trimester abortion , conceive spontaneously . The objective study observe impact lifestyle intervention take home baby rate , observe intervention could reduce prevalence preeclampsia neonatal hypoglycemia . From 2011 2015 , 480 patient age 18 42 year ≥ 2 consecutive first-trimester abortion document pathology ultrasonography , randomly assign protocol Walking Diet ( W+D ) standard follow-up ( control ) . Women enrol independent severe dysmenorrhea adolescence . Patients assign protocol W+D instruct walk briskly ≥ 40 minute seven day week . In addition , recommend avoid high-carbohydrate meal snack , candy , fiber-free juice , coconut water sugar-sweetened beverage , eat two daily serving meat , poultry , fish ( e.g . 2 g/kg ) protein-rich food , start decide get pregnant continue delivery . Women antiphospholipid antibody , second- third-trimester loss , multiple pregnancy , anatomical abnormality could increase risk first-trimester abortion , condition require priori anticoagulation exclude .</detailed_description>
