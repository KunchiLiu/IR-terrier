	<brief_summary>Pelvic girdle pain ( PGP ) pregnancy occur approximately 70 % female 38 % woman continue suffer PGP symptom beyond 12 week follow delivery . PGP post- partum cause pain everyday activity impact negatively health relate quality life associate significant healthcare societal cost . These woman often refer physiotherapy , however management difficult weak evidence base management . Alongside provision advice information , physiotherapists commonly prescribe orthoses rigid belt aim optimise pelvic stability reduce pain . More recently novel customised Dynamic Elastomeric Fabric Orthosis develop alternative 'off shelf ' pelvic belt . No study investigate effectiveness complement standard physiotherapy advice management . We undertake comprehensive systematic review literature critically evaluate evidence base conservative management chronic post-partum PGP . This inform single case experimental design . Here eight AB single case study perform point intervention randomise subject . The use randomisation test permit subsequent statistical analysis group effect . Participants ' pain , activity level , quality life evaluate along subjective change confidence urinary incontinence . Adherence orthosis use diarised . Exit interview assess aspect appropriateness outcome measure acceptability intervention help inform future clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Management Chronic Post-Partum Pelvic Girdle Pain Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic girdle pain ( PGP ) occur 70 % pregnant woman ; 25 % severe pain 8 % severe disability require use crutch , wheelchair confinement bed ( Wu et al , 2004 ) . At personal level , woman PGP find everyday activity turn bed , prolong walking , carry item may cause pain ; impact negatively quality life ( Wang et al , 2004 ) . In economic term societal cost significant , mainly consequence work absenteeism ; 20 % people require average 7 week sick leave ( Noren et al , 1997 ) . The impact problem significant ; 812 , 970 delivery occur throughout UK 2012/13 ( http : //www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/index.html ) . Pregnancy relate PGP also document increase . PGP pregnancy think occur due increase pelvic joint motion consequence hormonal biomechanical factor . For many woman PGP symptom resolve within approximately 3 month delivery , however , approximately 38 % female continue experience pain beyond 3 month follow delivery ( Gutke et al 2010 , Van de Pol et al 2006 ) . It unknown chronic symptom persist , age , parity , pre- pregnancy body mass index ( BMI ) , mode delivery previous PGP , along emotional psychosocial factor identify risk factor associate chronic PGP ( Robinson et al , 2010 ) ) . Further , woman caesarean section increase risk post-partum chronic PGP , noteworthy give increase percentage woman elect caesarean section early symptomatic relief peri-partum PGP . Urinary incontinence also document affect approximately 70 % female suffer pregnancy relate PGP . If PGP symptom continue postpartum urinary incontinence report continue due association PGP pelvic floor muscle weakness ( Fitzgerald et al , 2012 ) . PGP difficult manage limit guidance literature conservative management . European Guidelines recommend exercise prescription PGP ( Vleeming et al , 2008 ) lead development Specialist Women 's Health group information booklet use current study . An integral part physiotherapist ' management approach PGP provision orthoses rigid pelvic belt , aim improve pelvic joint stability thus reduce pain . Pelvic belt apply force pelvis within transverse plane . Recently dynamic elastomeric fabric orthoses ( DEFO ) develop . A DEFO make elastomeric panel ( e.g . Lycra Â® ) pre-stretched provide force multiple direction pelvis . Thus provide continue multi-axis support whilst flexible enough allow people participate everyday activity . Studies sport people pelvic girdle pain show application force one plane decrease pain improves function see application transverse force associate pelvic belt ( Sawle et al , 2013 ) . Therefore DEFO may advantage current rigid pelvic belt term mode action , clinical effectiveness user satisfaction . To date comprehensive literature search reveal trial orthotic use woman chronic PGP post-partum . This project therefore follow recommendation Medical Research Council development evaluation complex intervention establish clear understand PGP management post-partum inform future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
