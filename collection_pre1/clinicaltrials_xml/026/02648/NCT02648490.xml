	<brief_title>An Open-label , Phase 1 Study Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose HLX07 , Patients With Advanced Solid Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role EGFR carcinogenesis lead development extensive evaluation EGFR-blocking agent cancer treatment . Two EGFR-targeted approach explore : ( ) small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor target intracellular EGFR tyrosine kinase domain ( b ) . mAbs target EGFR extra-cellular domain . Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor widely use lung cancer EGFR mutation . However , result use small molecule inhibitor cancer overexpressed wildtype EGFR unsatisfactory . The best-studied anti-EGFR mAbs cancer cetuximab ( Erbitux® ) , panitumumab ( Vectibix® ) . Necitumumab , another humanize anti-EGFR mAb currently investigation multiple cancer . Both cetuximab panitumumab approve colorectal cancer head/neck cancer . Cetuximab chimeric human-murine IgG1 mAb , block ligand bind EGFR , thereby diminish receptor dimerization autophosphorylation induce EGFR downregulation . The immunoglobulin IgG1 isotype cetuximab may also engage hose immune function antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . Cetuximab approve use combination chemotherapy show improve survival patient advance colorectal cancer . Cetuximab , use combination radiotherapy also improve response rate patient locally advanced head/neck cancer . However , use cetuximab associate rare anaphylactic reaction , likely relate specific glycosylation molecule possibly mouse/human chimeric structure . Panitumumab human IgG2 mAb target EGFR . But unlike cetuximab , mediate effect mechanisms ADCC , different bind site EGFR extracellular domain cetuximab , also approve colorectal cancer head/neck cancer . However , side effect , especially skin reaction , pronounce patient receive panitumumab , also limit clinical use . Although cetuximab panitumumab target EGFR , clinical study cetuximab panitumumab show level EGFR expression cancer cell affect efficacy drug.So far unclear . However , several retrospective study show presence K-ras , B-raf mutation predict poor response either cetuximab panitumumab . Likewise , clear answer phenomenon . Therefore , study , investigator examine expression EGFR cancer cell enrol patient , use expression enrollment . But , study , investigator exclude patient whose cancer cell harbor either K-ras , B-raf mutation , since investigator vivo study also demonstrate HLX07 effective cancer cell K-ras mutation . HLX07 improved version anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody . There several important improvement development HLX07 . First , investigator re-engineered Fab portion antibody modify glycosylation pattern antibody- make less immunogenic well bind affinity . Second , investigator produce antibody use CHO cell system , lead clean glycosylation profile good yield . Therefore , investigator expect result provide good affordable option patient advance cancer . The investigator vitro vivo animal study demonstrate anti-cancer effect HLX07 dose level either equal superior cetuximab . In toxicokinetic study monkey , toxicity profile HLX07 good cetuximab . Therefore , investigator confident HLX07 good solution patient benefit anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy . However , HLX07 test human yet . Therefore , investigator propose first-in-human phase 1 study . In study , investigator intend investigate safety , tolerability HLX07 human , hope identify maximum tolerate dose , determine recommend phase 2 dose future study . At time , investigator would like gain information pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug potential immunogenicity . To minimize risk patient volunteer receive experimental drug , investigator choose 50 mg flat dose initial start dose . The selection start dose base repeat-dose toxicology study monkey . In 3-month repeat-dose study , high non-severely toxic dose ( HNSTD ) weekly 60 mg/kg . The human equivalent dose HNSTD 20 mg/kg . One-sixth 20 mg/kg adult 70 kilogram 233 mg . In order provide sufficient safety factor FIH study , investigator select 50 mg flat dose start dose study . To investigate dose require reach maximal effect , investigator propose dose escalation sequence . The purpose dose escalation obtain pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics HLX07 different dose level , investigate relationship adverse reaction . Also , investigator intend identify MTD determine dose require reach 90 % saturation clearance . The information dose escalation crucial determine optimal dose future study potential indication HLX07 .</detailed_description>
