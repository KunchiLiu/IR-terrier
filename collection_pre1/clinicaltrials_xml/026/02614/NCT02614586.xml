	<brief_title>Evaluation TAK-058 Ondansetron P50 Auditory Gating Participants With Stable Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-058 . TAK-058 test evaluate effect P50 auditory gate people stable schizophrenia . This study look effect TAK-058 P50 auditory gaiting people schizophrenia . This study perform sequential manner progress optimization ( screen ) phase healthy volunteer , screen subject schizophrenia part 1 , 3 period crossover treatment phase part 2 . In screen phase , 15 healthy volunteer enrol optimize setting measurement neurophysiological marker prior dose participant schizophrenia . If optimization reach , study terminate . In part 1 participant schizophrenia receive 2 P50 electroencephalography ( EEG ) session . A measurable deficit auditory P50 gate S2/S1 ratio great ( &gt; ) 0.5 establish phase . The intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) calculate P50 auditory gate S2/S1 ratio collect 2 session . If P50 auditory gate S2/S1 ratio measurement find least fair level agreement within individual ( , ICC &gt; 0.5 ) , part 2 study begin . 12 participant demonstrate P50 impairment part 1 , randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one six treatment crossover sequence â€”which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Placebo + TAK-058 + Ondansetron - TAK-058 + Placebo + Ondansetron - Ondansetron + Placebo + TAK-058 - Placebo + Ondansetron + TAK-058 - TAK-058 + Ondansetron + Placebo - Ondansetron + TAK-058 + Placebo All participant ask take one dose capsule , follow 1 hour later one dose solution Day 1 intervention period . This single-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study approximately118 day . Participants make confine clinic 3 day ( Day -1 Day 2 period ) , final visit schizophrenic participant Part 2 receive TAK-058 , Day 2 Period 3 ( final visit optimization phase healthy participant ) , telephonic follow assessment 21 day last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
