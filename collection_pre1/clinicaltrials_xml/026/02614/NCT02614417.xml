	<brief_title>Sleep-disordered Breathing Eisenmenger Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital heart defect ( CHD ) occur approximately 1 % live birth . Around 5 % adult CHD develop pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , 25-50 % patient exhibit serious form , Eisenmenger syndrome . Eisenmenger syndrome cause systemic-to-pulmonary shunt , eventually lead high pulmonary vascular resistance right-to-left bi-directional shunt . Right-to-left shunting reduces systemic arterial oxygen capacity consequently cause cyanosis , may result hypoxic tissue damage multi-organ disease . The natural history Eisenmenger syndrome ( ES ) generally poor compare general population late report actual survival rate 94 % , 74 % 52 % 40 , 50 60 year age , respectively . Until recently conventional symptomatic treatment diuretic , digitalis , antiarrhythmic , anticoagulant , iron supplement , oxygen therapy , ultimately heart-lung transplantation option . Most patient die progressive cardiovascular disease heart failure , sudden heart death haemoptysis . However , introduction advance therapy ( AT ) improve symptom may also change prognosis patient . Thus , new study show beneficial effect treatment advance therapy include endothelin receptor antagonist , phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor , prostanoids . These pulmonary vasodilator recognize targeted therapy Eisenmenger syndrome . Sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) predominantly obstructive central sleep apnoea ( OSA/CSA ) Cheyne-Stokes respiration ( CSR ) show common comorbidity patient heart failure ( HF ) , present least 50 % patient . In general Danish population estimate prevalence 3-18 % men 5-7 % woman . Studies HF patient also suggest increase rate central sleep apnoea ( CSA ) versus obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) compare general population . SDB may promote progression chronic heart failure ( HF ) independently associate decreased survival rate . The standard treatment patient OSA nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) usually deliver tight fitting nasal mask . The benefit CPAP well establish group patient , oppose CSA-patients . The large randomize study demonstrate effect nocturnal CPAP patient HF CSA heart transplant-free survival , improvement apnoea frequency , blood oxygenation leave ventricle function . While CPAP assist breathe device may use SDB related HF , place treatment patient ES , rise intra-thoracic pressure consequently increase PVR right-to-left shunting worsen cyanosis . The treatment CSA HF remain controversial ; however aggressive optimization medical treatment congestive heart failure seem improve condition . In patient , effect CPAP , nocturnal oxygen drug stimulate central respiratory drive less well document related adverse event increase risk arrhythmia . Though relationship HF SDB well establish , prevalence influence SDB Eisenmenger syndrome previously examine . There many similarity ES HF , several important difference also present . In congestive heart failure ventricular insufficiency relate increased left side filling pressure follow pulmonary stasis oedema , whereas ES patient often normal filling pressure normal systemic vascular resistance , high pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) cyanosis due right-left shunt . The aim study examine group Eisenmenger Syndrome patient establish prevalence SDB patient group , examine mechanism ( CSA OSA ) behind SDB Eisenmenger syndrome , relate presence SDB high level secondary erythrocytosis . If role SDB ES demonstrate , study necessary demonstrate whether SDB Eisenmenger syndrome alter advanced therapy . Hypotheses - The prevalence SDB Eisenmenger syndrome high general population . - SDB Eisenmenger syndrome cause central rather obstructive mechanism . - SDB Eisenmenger syndrome relate pronounced secondary erythrocytosis explain daytime measurement oxygen saturation .</detailed_description>
