	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect tucatinib vs. placebo combination capecitabine trastuzumab progression-free survival ( PFS ) per RECIST 1.1 base independent central review .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Tucatinib v Placebo Combination With Capecitabine &amp; Trastuzumab Patients With Advanced HER2+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized , international , multi-center , double-blinded study patient pretreated unresectable locally advanced metastatic HER2+ breast cancer prior treatment taxane , trastuzumab , pertuzumab T-DM1 . Patients randomize 2:1 ratio receive tucatinib placebo combination capecitabine trastuzumab . Stratification factor include presence history treat untreated brain metastasis ( yes/no ) , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) ( 0 vs. 1 ) , region world ( US v Canada v Rest World ) . No crossover placebo tucatinib allow . Safety assessment perform minimum every three week throughout study treatment 30 day last dose study drug . Laboratory assessment perform locally site . Cardiac ejection fraction assess MUGA/ECHO screen every 12 week thereafter . Brain MRI perform baseline patient . Efficacy assessment utilize RECIST 1.1 include measurement know site metastatic locally advanced unresectable disease baseline , every 6 week first 24 week , every 9 week thereafter . Repeat MRI brain required schedule patient brain metastasis . All treatment decision make base upon investigator assessment radiologic scan . All patient undergo repeat MRI brain within 30 day end treatment . Patients arm study continue follow OS completion study treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Have histologically confirm HER2+ breast carcinoma , HER2+ define fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) and/or 3+ stain immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) Have receive previous treatment taxane , trastuzumab , pertuzumab , TDM1 Have progression unresectable locally advanced metastatic breast cancer last systemic therapy ( confirmed investigator ) , intolerant last systemic therapy Have measurable nonmeasurable disease assessable RECIST 1.1 Be least 18 year age time consent Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) 0 1 Have adequate hepatic renal function Have leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) â‰¥ 50 % CNS Inclusion Based screen brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , patient must one following : No evidence brain metastasis Untreated brain metastasis need immediate local therapy Previously treat brain metastasis 1 . Brain metastases previously treat local therapy may either stable since treatment may progress since prior local CNS therapy 2 . Patients treat CNS local therapy newly identify lesion find initial MRI perform screen study may eligible enroll follow criterion meet : . Time since whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) &gt; 21 day prior first dose study treatment , time since stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) &gt; 7 day prior first dose study treatment , time since surgical resection &gt; 28 day ii . Other site evaluable disease present c. Relevant record CNS treatment must available allow classification target nontarget lesion Exclusion Criteria Have previously treat : 1. lapatinib within 12 month start study treatment 2. neratinib , afatinib , investigational HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) time previously Have previously treat capecitabine metastatic disease . Note : Patients receive capecitabine adjuvant neoadjuvant treatment least 12 month prior start study treatment eligible . Have clinically significant cardiac disease Are know carrier Hepatitis B Hepatitis C know chronic liver disease Are know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Unable reason undergo MRI brain CNS Exclusion Based screen brain MRI , patient must follow : Any untreated brain metastasis &gt; 2.0 cm size , unless discuss medical monitor Ongoing use systemic corticosteroid control symptoms brain metastasis total daily dose &gt; 2 mg dexamethasone ( equivalent ) Any lesion think require immediate local therapy . Patients undergo local treatment lesion identify screen MRI may still eligible study base criterion describe CNS inclusion criterion Known concurrent leptomeningeal disease ( LMD )</criteria>
