	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose buparlisib give together ofatumumab ibrutinib treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia return period improvement respond treatment . Buparlisib ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , ofatumumab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Giving buparlisib ibrutinib ofatumumab together may work well treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Buparlisib Ofatumumab Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) combine ofatumumab buparlisib patient previously treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) expose ibrutinib ( i.e. , ibrutinib pre-treated ) . II . To evaluate safety dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) combine ibrutinib buparlisib patient previously treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) NOT expose ibrutinib ( i.e. , ibrutinib naïve ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine specific toxicity associate combined buparlisib ofatumumab . II . Evaluate efficacy buparlisib combination ofatumumab ibrutinib pre-treated patient CLL/SLL . III . To determine specific toxicity associate combined buparlisib ibrutinib . IV . To evaluate efficacy buparlisib combination ibrutinib ibrutinib naive patient CLL/SLL . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study buparlisib . Patients assign 1 2 treatment cohort . COHORT A ( ibrutinib pre-treated ) : Patients receive buparlisib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 ofatumumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1-2 ; day 1 course 4-7 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT B ( ibrutinib naive ) : Patients receive buparlisib Cohort A ibrutinib PO day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
