	<brief_summary>Whereas advantageous effect exercise-training memory increasingly recognize , practicality clinical usefulness intervention community-dwelling old African Americans ( AA ) Mild Cognitively Impaired ( MCI ) subject , mechanism effect occur need elucidation . Because aerobic-exercise improve emerge cardiovascular ( CVD ) -related risk factor cognitive decline lipid , inflammatory cytokine glucose homeostasis ; Investigators examine train effect related biomarkers . The imperative study underscore fact , AAs : ) high rate dementia , ii ) paucity cross-sectional , lack prospective data effect exercise cognition . To overcome barrier recruitment retention , enhance compliance long exercise program ( 3-times/week ) , maximize use available resource , Investigators use community-based approach . Therefore , primary objective study build Investigators ' experience , compare effect aerobic-exercise stretch-exercise ( control ) community-dwelling AA MCI subject . Following initial 6 month active intervention , aerobic-exercise group follow prescribe free living 40 minute , 3 time/week exercise regimen control group return usual care plus stretch-exercise additional 12 month . This study facilitate estimation sample size large confirmatory study AAs . A newly acquire direct oversight DC Ward-6 Senior Wellness Center infrastructures Howard University Division Geriatrics provide additional resource access community . In addition Investigator 's feasibility aim , Investigators determine performance cognitive task use Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Sub-scale ( ADAS-Cog ) Clinical Dementia Rating Scale ( CDR ) sum box supplement test executive function ( EF ) Functional Activity Questionnaire ( FA ) together ADAS-Cog-Plus ; change brain volume region interest ( ROI ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , select CVD AD-related bio-markers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although anticholinesterase therapy greatly improve symptomatic treatment Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , demonstrate significantly slow disease progression ; amyloid-directed therapy produce disappointing result . A promising evidence-based relatively side-effect free lifestyle approach emerge alternative adjunct drug therapy . In cross-section prospective study , randomize controlled trial ; aerobic exercise-training demonstrate improve cognition old subject . However , mechanisms effect remain poorly understood . Because recognize cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk catalyze AD development , vital test whether lifestyle adaptation show reduce CVD risk favorably modify cognitive trajectory marker neurodegeneration . Such intervention may benefit early clinically discernible prodromal stage AD mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . Notably , data currently lack African Americans ( AA ) harbor high rate CVD risk AD . While laboratory approach exercise intervention study require prove causation , design may lend real-life application , demand many economically educationally disadvantage old AAs experience early symptom cognitive deterioration . To address concern , Investigators seek initiate 18-month study , test real-life applicability effect exercise adaptation memory ideal community set . However , choose exercise academic center exclude . Collection outcome measure baseline , 3-month , 6-month , 9-month , 12-month 18-month provide pilot data inform dose duration effect exercise outcome measure . In addition augment enrollment , propose approach bolster retention . The objective pilot study , therefore , examine feasibility community-based 18-month study ( 6-month active intervention 12-month passive follow-up ) aerobic exercise-training neurodegeneration AAs MCI subject . The Investigators test hypothesis randomize subject one 2 group : 1 . ) aerobic-exercise ; 2 . ) stretch-exercise ( control ) . The Investigators propose aerobic-exercise group perform good control group cognitive measure . Secondarily , Investigators determine whether training-induced change cognition relate increase brain volume . Exploratory , Investigators also investigate intervention effect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarkers , select CVD risk factor biomarkers , cerebral oxygenation Hypoxia-Inducible Factors ( HIF-1α ) gene expression , Apolipoprotein E gene ( APOE ) , assess mediation training-induced change cognition . A team experience Investigators neuroimaging , neurology , cognitive neuroscience , exercise physiology assemble conduct study . Working collaboratively District Columbia Office Aging ( DCOA ) , Directors Ward 6 Senior Wellness Center operate DCOA , lead agency age ( community grassroots organization support DCOA ) , Investigators recruit , enroll , randomize , train participant wellness center . After obtain informed consent complete initial assessment , participant undergo initial exercise screen determine ability exercise safely . Following randomization 80 volunteer aerobic-exercise ( 40 ) control ( 40 ) ; baseline neuropsychological , neuroimaging biomarker measurement obtain . Both group undergo 3 times/week supervise group-specific intervention wellness center 6 month . After initial 6 month active intervention , aerobic-exercise group follow prescribe free living 40 minute , 3 time/week exercise regimen , control group return usual care . Baseline test repeat 3 month , 6 month ( active intervention period ) ; 9 , 12 18 month ( passive follow-up period ) . Treadmill , lumber puncture ( LP ) brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) test occur baseline 6 month . Between group change cognitive performance , biomarkers , neuroimaging measurement compare use appropriate multivariate method . While Investigators remain cognizant plan ongoing fitness memory trial , propose study unique sense : logical extension Investigators ' ongoing work ; test propose hypothesis predominantly AA sample paucity data remain , therefore , advance reduction health disparity ; obtain data multiple time-points ( baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 18 month ) therefore allow assessment effect duration dose intervention outcome measure ; test real-life applicability propose intervention community set ; generate pilot data mechanism intervention affect memory . Importantly , outcome study may lead practical effective strategy delay cognitive decline population risk , prevent attenuate physical , psychological economic burden associate dementia AAs .</detailed_description>
