	<brief_title>Study Sulfatinib Treating Advanced Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma Iodine-refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study adopt Simon 's two-stage design method . In first stage , When first 12 patient enrol complete therapy Cycle 1 , investigator sponsor analyze safety pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data , determine whether dose suitable TC enrollment stop period.15 subject enrol subgroup ( advanced MTC iodine-refractory DTC ) , 10 subject subgroups enrol efficacy assessment second stage . Patients receive oral sulfatinib dose 300mg/d within 1 hour breakfast ( once-daily dosing continuously , every 28-day treatment cycle ) disease progression , death , intolerable toxicity , opinion investigator , patient longer derive clinical beneﬁt、lost follow-up、withdrew informed consent form , sponsor terminate study , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
