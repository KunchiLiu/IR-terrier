	<brief_summary>Objectives : Little known effectiveness respiratory muscle training patient stroke heart failure . To investigate feasibility effectiveness inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) respiratory muscle strength , cardiopulmonary function , exercise capacity , fatigue quality life stroke patient congestive heart failure . Design : A single-blind prospective randomize control study . Setting : A tertiary care medical center . Participant method A total twenty stroke patient stable CHF , class I-III [ NYHA ( New York Heart Association ) ] , age 20 85 year-old , eligible randomly assign IMT control group . Stroke confirm computerized tomography magnetic resonance imaging . And CHF confirm cardiologist . Both group receive conventional stroke rehabilitation program diaphragmatic breathing training . The IMT group train daily , 30 minute per day , least 5 time week , 4 week ; readmitted hospital 2 week later . For check compliance IMT home , patient monitor make phone call twice week . Or patient receive patient program 10 week admit hospital . Main outcome measurement : Each subject 's baseline characteristic , duration disease , neurological level ( Brunnstrom 's stage ) , functional level , spirometry ; rest heart rate , blood pressure , rest oxyhemoglobin saturation ( SpO2 ) , low rest SpO2 , maximal inspiratory pressure , maximal expiratory pressure , rest oxyhemoglobin saturation ( SpO2 ) , low rest SpO2 Borg 's scale 6-minute walking test , handgrip strength , visual analog scale severity fatigue , fatigue assessment scale , Barthel scale assess program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training Stroke Patients With Stable Congestive Heart Failure : Prospective RCT .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total forty stroke patient stable CHF , NYHA ( New York Heart Association ) class I-III , age 20 85 year-old , eligible randomly assign IMT control group . The diagnosis CHF accord framingham Criteria . Consensus complete intervention . All technician perform different measurement assess outcomes blind group assignment . Both group receive conventional stroke rehabilitation program . Exclusion criterion Patients ca n't tightly place lip mouthpiece air leakage inhale exhale threshold device , COPD , history recent exacerbation , unstable angina , decompensated CHF , complicate arrhythmia , risk history pneumothorax , large bulla chest radiograph , mark osteoporosis together history spontaneous rib fracture , history recent lung surgery ( ie , within 12 month ) , use long-term oxygen therapy . The Institutional Review Board Chang Gung Memorial Hospital , Kaohsiung Medical Center approve study protocol patient provide informed consent . IMT training : Inspiratory muscle training perform use pressure threshold device ( ThresholdÂ® IMT HS730 , RESPIRONICS Inc , Cedar Grove , NJ , USA ) . During training , patient sit position nose-clip instructed place lip around mouthpiece , inhale enough force open valve , exhale mouthpiece , continue inhale exhale without remove device mouth . During initial training session , patient encourage start resistance equal 30 % MIP load patient tolerate , load gradually increase 2cm H2O per week symptom tolerate accord RPE scale . Throughout first session training , monitor oxygen saturation apply . And load minimize decrease oxygen saturation load breathing Patients take intermittent period rest feel uncomfortable ; patient tolerate increase resistance patient unable finish full session training , last part train continue . Patients warn expect transient delayed-onset muscle soreness , consequence muscle adaptation unaccustomed activity . And train immediately stop experience severe sharp pain inspiration . Patient train daily , total 30 minute 15 minute twice per day , least 5 time week , 4 week ; readmitted hospital 2 week later . For check compliance IMT home , patient monitor make phone call twice week . Or patient receive outpatient program 10 week readmitted hospital , patient directly receive outpatient program admit hospital..</detailed_description>
