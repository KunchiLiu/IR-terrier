	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 , two-step , open-label study outcome analytic treatment interruption ( ATI ) patient start antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) Fiebig Stage I acute HIV infection ( AHI ) , define detectable HIV-RNA without detectable p24 antigen HIV IgM . The primary endpoint rate sustain viral suppression , define HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 cps/ml 24 week treatment interruption . During ATI subject monitor closely safety ART re-initiated meet predefined clinical , virological , immunological criterion . In step I , 8 subject undergo ATI . An interim analysis safety conduct 12 week . If none subject maintain viral suppression 12 week subject enrol study . If least 1 8 subject maintain viral suppression 12 week additional 7 subject enrol step 2 . At ATI antiretroviral drug discontinue . Subjects monitor clinical exam , immunological ( CD4 ) , virological ( HIV-RNA ) test baseline fix schedule 24 week . ART re-initiated immediately subject meet pre-defined clinical , immunological virological safety endpoint monitoring period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Viral Suppression After Analytic Treatment Interruption Thai Patients Who Initiated Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy During Acute HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two step open label study ATI patient initiated ART early detectable stage ( Fiebig I ) HIV infection . In step I , eight subject discontinue ART period 24 week . An interim assessment conduct eight subject step I complete follow-up 12 week . If least one eight subject maintain viral suppression ( HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml ) 12 week , study proceed step 2 , 7 additional subject ( maximum total sample size 15 ) undergo ATI . The primary endpoint proportion subject maintain viral suppression 24 week post ATI . Subjects monitor frequently disease progression use clinical , immunological virological criterion . ART re-initiated immediately subject meet pre-defined criterion disease progression . Parent Study Cohort This sub-study protocol `` Establish characterize acute HIV infection cohort high-risk population '' ( SEARCH 010 , RV254 , WRAIR 1494 ) implement Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Center Bangkok , Thailand . From April 2009 February 2014 cohort enrol 150 patient acute infection 145 ( 97 % ) still active follow-up . All patient cohort offer ART time enrollment separately fund protocol ; 145 subject ( 100 % ) active follow-up currently ART . The median age ( range ) cohort 28 ( 18-57 ) year 90 % men sex men ( MSM ) . The cohort currently 50 volunteer start ART Fiebig Stage 1 , 24 ART &gt; 24 month HIV-1 &lt; 50 copies/ml . Another 13 volunteer ART 6-24 month undetectable HIV-1 RNA . During period co-enrollment substudy , additional biological specimen collect part RV254/SEARCH 010 protocol . Data sample substudy share parent protocol . Criteria reinitiate ART ATI The criterion restart ART ATI design protect subject possible clinical , immunological , virological adverse effect event VL rebound ART . The viral load ( VL ) criterion &gt; 1,000 copies/ml choose clinical symptom HIV infection significant decline CD4 count would expect low level viremia . The Fiebig I patient SEARCH 010 cohort median ( range ) HIV-1 RNA 4.8 ( 2.8-5.7 ) log10copies/ml , median ( range ) 12 ( 4-40 ) day exposure HIV , prior initiation ART therefore already expose high level plasma virus acute infection maintain low detectable HIV proviral reservoir . In addition , ANRS Visconti study find patient virologic controller ( sustain VL &lt; 50 copies/ml ) ATI may initially transiently VL detection . Of 240 test perform treatment interruption subsequently virologic controller PTC , 2 % VL &gt; 400 copies/ml 18 % VL 50 400 copies/ml . Therefore , low-level viremia may always indicative viral rebound potentially reverse . Specific criterion re-initiation ART ATI : 1 . HIV-1 RNA 1,000 copies/ml 2 consecutive determination least 3 day apart . OR 2 . HIV-1 RNA rise ≥ 0.5 log10copies/ml per day provide last HIV-1 RNA 1000 copies/ml OR 3 . A single HIV-1 RNA 10,000 copies/ml OR 4 . CD4+ T-cell count 350 cells/mm3 2 consecutive determination least 2 week apart . OR 5 . CD4+ T-cell count decline &gt; 50 % baseline prior ATI . OR 6 . Clinical progression CDC Category B C disease . OR 7 . Diagnosis Acute Retroviral Syndrome . OR 8 . Pregnancy OR 9 . Subject request re-initiation ART .</detailed_description>
