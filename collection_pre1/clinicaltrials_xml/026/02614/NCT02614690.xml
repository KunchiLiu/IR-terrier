	<brief_title>Is Univalving Bivalving Long Arm Casts Forearm Fractures Necessary ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following cast application , little know regard need split cast , either univalve ( split along single side cast ) bivalve ( split along side cast ) fashion . Theoretically , split cast allow expansion soft tissue swell . However , review literature yield paucity evidence demonstrate efficacy split cast . In study Nietosvaara et . al , retrospective examination 109 pediatric patient initially treat closed cylindrical casting close forearm fracture evaluate . Of 109 patient , one-sixth require initial cast split , trim , remove secondary post-traumatic swelling . However , split cast without risk . Once initial swell dissipates , univalved bivalved cast become excessively loose . This loosening associate loss reduction . If loss reduction substantial , may require re-reduction operation correct . In addition , every use cast saw patient place risk iatrogenic cast saw injury . Thermal burn abrasion cast saws cause lifelong emotional physical scar patient . They also incite event litigation hospital provider , settlement average great $ 12,000 per centimeter cast saw injury .</detailed_description>
