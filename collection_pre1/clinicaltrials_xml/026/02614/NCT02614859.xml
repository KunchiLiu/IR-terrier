	<brief_summary>Obesity metabolic syndrome prevalent among prostate cancer patient . Having elevate insulin level blood associate short median time cancer progression median overall survival patient elevate PSA prior treatment . Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) drug like bicalutamide frequently use patient population , proven benefit , may increase mortality morbidity.This study evaluate metformin combination bicalutamide affect prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bicalutamide With Without Metformin Biochemical Recurrence Overweight Obese Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 Cycle = 28 day = 4 week . Treatment administer outpatient basis ӿ Metformin start dose 500 mg BID , gradually increase target dose 1000mg BID . Treatment ARM A Cycles 1 - 2 : Observation without treatment Cycles 3 - 8 : Bicalutamide 50 mg daily , orally , continuously end study ( week 32 ) . Treatment ARM B Cycles 1 - 2 : In order minimize gastrointestinal discomfort , metformin dosing ramp period 2 week . Metformin treatment start 500 mg BID ( Dose Level -2 ) increase increment 500 mg daily every week +/- 2 day provide grade 2 high gastrointestinal toxicity note . If grade 2 great gastrointestinal toxicity occur first 4 week treatment , subject evaluate every 2 week resolution toxicity grade 0 1 , , metformin dose increase next dose level . The target dose metformin 1000 mg BID .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent Male 18 year old Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis prostate cancer Patient must previous treatment definitive surgery radiation therapy cryoablation Patient may prior salvage therapy ( surgery , radiation local ablative procedure ) within 6 month prior randomization intent cure.Prophylactic radiotherapy prevent gynecomastia within 4 week prior randomization allow BMI &gt; 25 study entry Patient may prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy ( chemotherapy , vaccine experimental agent ) within 4 week prior randomization , PSA rise PSADT document testosterone level &gt; 150ng/dL . Patient must hormonesensitive prostate cancer evident serum total testosterone level &gt; 150 ng/dL within 12 week prior randomization . PSA must &lt; 30 ng/mL study entry Patient may therapy modulate testosterone level ( luteinizing hormone , releasinghormone agonists/antagonists antiandrogens ) within 1 year prior randomization , unless neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant set Patient must evidence biochemical failure primary therapy subsequent progression . Biochemical failure declare PSA reach threshold value primary treatment differs radical prostatectomy radiation therapy . 1 . For radical prostatectomy threshold study PSA ≥ 0.2ng/mL 2 . For radiation therapy threshold PSA rise 2 ng/mL nadir PSA achieve post radiation without hormone therapy ( 2006 RTOGASTRO Consensus definition ) . 3 . PSA progression require PSA rise threshold measure time point since threshold reach . PSA double time 3 9 month . PSA calculation require two consecutive PSA rise ( PSA2 PSA3 ) threshold PSA ( total 3 PSA value ) ; PSA2 PSA3 must obtain within 12 month study entry . All baseline PSAs obtain reference lab . Patient 's PSA doubling time must calculate use follow formula ( http : //www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/psa doublingtime ) : ECOG performance status less equal 2 Ability swallow study drug Subjects must normal organ marrow function define : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,000/mL 2 . Hemoglobin great equal 10 g/dL 3 . Platelets great equal 100,000/mL 4 . Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit 5 . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 1.5 X institutional ULN 6 . Creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 7 . Hgb A1c ≤ 6.5 Evidence metastatic disease image study ( CT and/or bone scan ) Diagnosis diabetes mellitus define 1 . Fasting blood glucose &gt; 126 mg/dl , 2 . Random blood glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl 3 .

Exceptions make patient meet following condition : Basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin prior malignancy adequately treat patient continuously disease free ≥ 2 year . Subjects currently treat metformin and/or bicalutamide treat metformin and/or bicalutamide past 6 month . Subjects take 5areductase inhibitor ( finasteride dutasteride ) , saw palmetto , PCSPES within last 6 week ineligible . Subjects eligible study wash period 6 week .</criteria>
