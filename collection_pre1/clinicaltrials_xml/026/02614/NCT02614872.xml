	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Intravenous Glassia® Treatment Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There clinical rationale advocate use AAT ( GLASSIA ) therapy episodes lung inflammation , include acute chronic rejection . AAT may provide specifically targeted prevention pathogenic inflammation , superior general immunosuppressant , little risk . AAT main inhibitor Neutrophil elastase ( NE ) low airways patient AAT deficiency low concentration protein region lung . This explain proteinase/antiproteinase theory development emphysema deficient patient amount elastase release lung exceed amount AAT . The net result persistence elastase activity lead lung destruction pathological change emphysema . Administration AAT help prevent destruction lung architecture reduce inflammatory dysregulation cause pulmonary dysfunction . It expect attack specific previously untreated key component pathophysiological cycle BOS , AAT therapy would decrease prevalence BOS lung transplant recipient prolong life expectancy patient . This open label study order ensure safety , frame POC study .</detailed_description>
