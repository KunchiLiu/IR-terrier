In absence clear laterality respect severity , side associate great surface area involvement select ( e.g. , patient bilateral headache leave , perceive retro-orbital whereas right retro-orbital temporal , therefore right side select ) , In absence lateralizing feature , initial treatment side randomly select . Then air insufflation start . The patient encourage relax process extent insufflation maintain level comfortable patient . The patient ask report sense aggravation symptom , would prompt examiner suspend treatment . The patient know treatment receive active placebo one . Following insufflation , ear plug remove patient ask rate severity symptoms describe change characteristic . A significant reduction pain level consider indication treatment appropriate patient treatment continue ipsilateral side . If patient describe resolution symptom hemi-distribution head ( `` symptom go side head 're still left side '' ) , treatment process repeat contralateral side resolution ( maximal reduction symptom ) achieve . Treatment session study last 20 minute . There followup 2h 24h post treatment monitor status patient invite back second treatmentduring subsequent episode migraine .
