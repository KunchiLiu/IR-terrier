	<detailed_description>The study randomise , double-blind , parallel-group design compare SFX-01 ( 300 mg ) take orally capsules suspension via nasogastric tube ( NG ) twice-daily 28 day versus placebo 90 patient SAH present within 48 hour ictus . The treatment group receive SFX-01 order improve outcome reduce long-term complication SAH Delayed Cerebral Ischaemia , reflect Trans-Cranial Doppler ( TCD ) reading . The objective demonstrate safety search signal efficacy patient SAH . A sub-study conducted 12 patient External Ventricular Drain ( EVD ) fit ; serial CSF sample take pre- &amp; post-dose two occasion determine pharmacokinetics Sulforaphane CSF comparison plasma pharmacokinetics . Sub-study patient undergo procedure ( exception lumbar puncture ) . Treatment duration 28 day ; follow duration 28 day , three six month . The planned trial period 24 month .</detailed_description>
