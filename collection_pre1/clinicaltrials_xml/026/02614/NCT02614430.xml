	<brief_summary>The project investigate level physical , psychosocial function inflammatory biomarkers group patient self-assessment indicates perceive risk decline work ability hospital admittance . The patient randomise intervention physical training follow development functional level compare patient receive intervention . The goal validate measure work ability assessment connection hospital admittance . The validation provide important information quality rehabilitation service many municipality provide private supplier - effect work ability lack evidence-based documentation . The project aim link patient treatment recovery optimal return everyday life , comprise patient work life . The frame multi-sectoral accept platform assess patient ' need care , treatment rehabilitation , base professional assessment efficacy quality , varies heath care related delivery . The acceptance multi-sectoral creates need accessible clinical test physical mental functioning , combine biomarkers identify patient need . The project investigate whether possible identify patient ( age 18 60 year ) increase risk lose ability work discharge acute hospitalisation . And evaluate whether measurable effect inflammation functional level labour orient training program identify .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project examine validity identification patient risk decrease work ability hospitalisation effect early intervention physical mental functional level . The project consist pilot study two clinical study investigate following : - The validity work ability assessment self-administered questionnaire hospitalisation . - The development inflammatory response discharge relation development self-rated health . - The effect labour orient train program measure inflammatory response functional level . - The effect labour orient train program work ability discharge . The self-administered questionnaire Work Ability Index test evaluate pilot study . Study 1 prospective cohort study test identification tool decrease work ability include inflammatory biomarkers functional level discharge . Study 2 randomise control intervention study effect labour orient train program initiate within 2 week discharge functional level self-rated health . Primary aim study 1 : testing validity Work Ability Index relation observation functional level measurement inflammatory biomarkers discharge . Primary aim study 2 : examine effect labour orient train functional level work ability . Following measuring tool use project : Work Ability Index , hand grip strength , gait speed ( 6M ) , Major Depression Inventory ( MDI ) , Self-rated health ( EQ-5D ) inflammatory biomarkers include marker inflammatory receptor , cytokine chemokines . Hand grip strength : The project manager train clinical staff test participant include study 1 . Participants test physical capacity measure grip strength . This assessed twice hand dynamometer 5 second dominant hand average calculate . Gait speed ( 6M ) : Physical function measure walk test 6 m. The participant measure start line message go normal pace mark field 8 m. The time measure first foot reach 6m point test repeat , average calculate . Major Depression Inventory ( MDI ) : MDI depression questionnaire 10 symptom , part World Health Organization 's definition depression . The table focus patient 's current experience symptom within last two week change disease extent rehabilitation cause . MDI use study rating scale theoretical sum score 0 ( depression ) 50 ( maximum depression ) . EQ-5D : EQ-5D validated questionnaire measure health status simple descriptive profile single index value , evaluate clinical health economic study self-rated health . The questionnaire approve EuroQol Group , include question mobility , personal care , activity , depression pain . Biomarkers : At admission , 2 - 12 week discharge blood sample take analysis inflammatory receptor , cytokine chemokines . The analysis carry batch sample collection ELISA / Luminex technology . Total duration test , instruction reply questionnaires represent total 45 minute per . participant Patients submit write informed consent participate base interview randomise intervention control group . The group stratify hospitalisation due medical surgical reason , physical work load education ensure equitable distribution among participant receive intervention . The intervention perform public-private collaboration health care provider specialise labour orient training . The program consist physical training program , individual motivational talk guidance labour market-oriented topic . Each program customise patient 's physical resource condition . The scope intervention physical activity 1-2 hour 3 time weekly concurrent motivational talk overall max . 9 week . The project aim include 120 patient give intervention size 50 participant estimate drop-out rate 20 % . The study carry accordance principle Helsinki Declaration . Participants cover Amager Hvidovre Hospital Patient Insurance . The collect data keep accordance Data Protection Agency guideline . The Project Manager work clinical staff participate department responsible contact patient meet inclusion criterion study . Patients meet inclusion criterion receive write verbal information project include advantage , disadvantage , risk patient right participation project . The patient contact project manager day verbal write information . If patient wish participate project obtain accepted consent form schedule time test blood sample . Results : The project help focus attention overlook task health care , patient treatment still risk lose ability work . The project also mean great knowledge use biomarkers may reflect development individual 's refund current level functioning .</detailed_description>
