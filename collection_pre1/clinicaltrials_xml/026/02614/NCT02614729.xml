	<brief_title>The Consumption Beef Appetite Cognitive Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two cross-over design study complete overweight , sedentary otherwise healthy woman . For study 1 , 17 participant randomly consume 4 eucaloric diet contain standard-protein ( SP ; 76±1g protein/d ) high-protein ( HP ; 126±1g protein/d ) 7 consecutive days/treatment . The SP treatment contain plant protein ( PLANT ) combination beef plant protein ( BEEF ) evenly distribute throughout day ( EVEN ) . The HP treatment also BEEF provide EVEN uneven distribution ( UNEVEN ) pattern . For study 2 , 17 participant randomly consume 3 energy restriction ( 1250 kcal/d ) diet contain SP-PLANT ( EVEN ) SP-BEEF ( EVEN ) ( , 48±1g protein/d ) HP-BEEF ( EVEN ) ( 123±1g protein/d ) . During day 6 treatment ( study ) , participant complete 12-h controlled-feeding , clinical test day include repeat appetite , satiety , food craving , mood questionnaire ; blood sampling ; cognitive function/performance test . During day 7 treatment ( study ) , participant complete free-living , ad libitum test day home/work ass ad libitum ( voluntary ) daily intake food choice .
