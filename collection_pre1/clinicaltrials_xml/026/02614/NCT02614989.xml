	<detailed_description>This study design prospective , single site , single arm , nonrandomized study . Assessments make MRgFUS clinical symptom relief , quality life ( QoL ) improvement , safety MRgFUS treatment multiple sclerosis patient severe medication refractory tremor . This study perform 3T MR scanner . The ExAblate system medical device involves focus ultrasound system MRI scanner . During MRgFUS pulse focus ultrasound energy , sonication , deliver targeted tissue . In particular study target tissue unilateral thermal lesion create ventralis intermedius nucleus thalamus . The treatment begin series standard diagnostic MR image identify location shape tumor treat . The computer use physician 's designation target volume plan best way cover target volume small spot call `` sonications '' . These treatment spot cylinder shape . Their size depend sonication power duration . During treatment , specific MR scan , process identify change tissue temperature , provide thermal map treatment volume confirm therapeutic effect . The thermal map use monitor treatment progress , confirm ablation proceed accord plan , thus close therapy loop . MRgFUS use transcranial operate helmet-shaped transducer position subject head . The transcranial system include mean immobilize subject head , cool interface water , software CT analysis phase correction computation . MRgFUS transcranial system relieve tremor multiple sclerosis patient investigate study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman , age 18 year old Patients able willing give inform consent able attend study visit Patients diagnosis Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) confirm clinical history examination neurologist . The patient must disable tremor MS indicate score least 2 Tremor Rating Scale ( TRS ) baseline global assessment examiner patient . Or Disabling define significant impairment normal function daily life indicate score least 5 Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) Severity scale.or ETRS The MS patient must disable medically refractory unilateral bilateral upper extremity tremor . Patients associated ipsilateral low extremity tremor exclude . The patient must history unsatisfactory response medical management . Any patient need try fail least one drug . Alternatively , patient may also qualify tremorsuppressing medication contraindicate due coexist medical condition drug allergy . Patients stable dose medication 30 day prior study entry Subjects standard contraindication MR image nonMRI compatible implant metallic device include cardiac pacemaker , size limitation , etc . Significant claustrophobia Subjects able willing tolerate require prolonged stationary supine position treatment Subjects unstable cardiac status Severe hypertension Current medical condition result abnormal bleeding and/or coagulopathy Receiving anticoagulant ( e.g . warfarin ) antiplatelet ( e.g . aspirin ) therapy within two week focus ultrasound procedure drug know increase risk hemorrhage History intracranial hemorrhage History multiple stroke , stroke within past 6 month Subjects history seizure within past year Subjects brain tumor Are participate participate another clinical trial last 30 day More mild nontremor cerebellar dysfunction ( ataxia , dysmetria , dysdiadokokinesia ) .
