	<brief_summary>Patients single ventricle physiology ( hypoplastic leave heart syndrome , tricuspid atresia ) frequently feed difficulty necessitate procedure Nissen fundoplication G-tube placement . With advance minimally invasive surgery , frequently perform use laparoscopic technique . Although generally safe effective , increase IAP laparoscopy may increase systemic pulmonary vascular resistance decrease cardiac output . This prospective study include 50 patient single ventricle physiology present laparoscopic procedure . There change anesthetic perioperative care patient . Tissue cerebral oxygenation monitor use near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) .</brief_summary>
