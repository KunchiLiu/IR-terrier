	<detailed_description>Introduction . Hospital-acquired pneumonia one frequent severe medical complication patient hospitalize intensive care unit . It develop mainly association invasive airway management mechanical ventilation . It important factor affect health care economy often related bacterial resistance . Understanding etiology pathogen potential resistance antimicrobial agent major impact patient ' morbidity mortality economic aspect treatment . Pneumonia diagnose assess clinical sign detect etiologic agent . Clinical sign assess especially find fresh progressive infiltrates chest radiograph , together least two sign respiratory tract infection . From epidemiological point view , pneumonia may either community-acquired ( CAP ) hospital-acquired ( HAP ) . CAP define develop community outside health care facility , patient hospitalize , clinical manifestation within 48 h hospital admission . HAP may characterize pneumonia develop 48 h admission health care facility within 14 day discharge . More precise classification accord time onset clinical sign distinguish early-onset ( 2 4 day admission ) late-onset ( day 5 admission ) HAP . The common pathogen cause CAP Streptococcus pneumoniae , Chlamydophila pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae . HAP mostly cause endogenous bacterial strain , originate primary microflora secondary colonize bacteria high level resistance early- late-onset form , respectively . This knowledge use select proper therapy since proportion individual pathogen determines strategy initial antibiotic treatment . Adequate antibiotic therapy important factor influence effectiveness therapy , course , patient 's survival . The prospective study aim identify etiologic agent pulmonary inflammation patient severe form respiratory insufficiency require mechanical ventilation . The objective describe prevalence respiratory tract pathogen , determine susceptibility range test antibiotic agent , acquire information proportion resistant strain population pathogen . The impact adequate antibiotic therapy assess , respect patient mortality morbidity rate . Hypothesis . Most sever type nosocomial bacterial pneumonia , require artificial lung ventilation often exogenous . The infection source transfer patient´s airway outsider hospitalisation . The object research bacterial agent direct recognition , originality identification base genome restrict fragment analysis . Material Methods . The group comprise patient hospitalize Intensive Care Departments cooperate hospital 1 May 2013 30 April 2015 develop sign HAP . Also include patient positive finding tracheal secretion admission department transfer another ward hospital . In intubated patient , secretion sample microbiology culture test obtain aspiration lower airway . Mortality statistically analyze Fisher 's exact test . The clinical sign pneumonia define presence newly develop progressive infiltrates chest radiographs plus least two sign respiratory tract infection : temperature &gt; 38 °C , purulent sputum , leukocytosis &gt; 10x103/mm3 leukopenia &lt; 4x103/mm3 , sign inflammation auscultation , cough and/or respiratory insufficiency oxygenation index≤300 mm Hg . Each sample process semiquantitative method base four-quadrant streak technique use calibrated loop . The etiologic agent consider relevant cultured tracheal secretion enough quantity . Tracheal secretion sample process traditional microbiological method . The microorganism identify biochemical dentification test , automate system . The yeast identify use commercial kit . If identical culture , determine etiologic agent , repeatedly isolated multiple sample obtain patient , first isolated culture include study . Susceptibility antibiotic determine standard microdilution method . Adequate initial therapy define administrative least one antibiotic ( suitable treat pneumonia ) show vitro effective isolate causative agent . Progress chart . The collection processing patient´s microbiological sample cooperatived clinic department 1 May 2013 30 April 2015 perform . The co-operative center send sample microbiological department hospital sample process safed . Collected data continuously central database store . The microbiological sample collection finish 30 April 2015 1 May 2015 31 december 2015 data analyse assess . The processing data allow express conclusion prepare proposal event . hygienical arrangement change . Way data acquire . In intubated patient , secretion sample microbiology culture test obtain aspiration lower airway . The group comprise patient hospitalize Intensive Care Department Hospitals , cooperate study , 1 May 2013 30April 2015 develop sign HAP . Also include patient positive finding tracheal secretion admission department transfer another ward hospital . Predicted number patient 300 ( 400 - 500 positive isolates ) . Considerate number estimate accord pilot study . Predicted number patient cooperate center 15 per month . There data analysis make statistic normality test Shapiro-Wilk Mann-Whitney U test . Computer program SPSS version 15 statistic assessment use . Cooperation . The project multicentric . There cooperate Departments Anesthesiology Intensive Care Medicine Olomouc , Brno , Hradec Kralove Thomayer 's Hospital Praha . The assess microbiological sample , collect patient hospital microbiologic department hospital make . Discussion . Given incidence 51 case total 508 patient hospitalize Department Anesthesiology Intensive Care Medicine Olomouc , Czech Republic , 2011 , prevalence ( 10 % ) low limit commonly report range ( 9-24 % ) . In agreement literature , case ( 86 % ) late-onset HAP . Bacterial pathogen associated majority death strain Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Burgholderia cepacia komplex Escherichia coli , 50 % multiresistant . In late-onset HAP , multiresistant strain account many 58 % strain . In early onset HAP , proportion multiresistant strain could reliably assess due small number case . The mortality rate patient receive adequate initial antibiotic therapy 13 % low treat antibiotic isolated bacterial pathogen later find resistant . According Fiser 's two-sided exact test , result difference mortality rate two study group significant ( P=0.385 ) , small set data . Given fact despite adequate initial antibiotic therapy , mortality rate relatively high ( 9 30 dead patient ) mortality also likely influenced time initiation antibiotic therapy . In case mortality rate patient adequate therapy , result ( 30 % ) agreement Luna et al . report 38 % . The author also find 91 % mortality associate inadequate therapy , much high rate result ( 43 % ) . The difference , however , might explain different epidemiological situation bacterial resistance level . HAP may characterize endogenous . Despite high proportion multiresistant strain , clonal spread confirm , exception Burgholderia cepacia komplex . Thus , secondary colonization patient 's microflora hospitalization likely .</detailed_description>
