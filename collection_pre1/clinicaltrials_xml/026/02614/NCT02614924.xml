	<brief_title>Comparison Flexible Fibreoptic Scope With Pentax AWS Videolaryngoscope Ease Intubation During Awake Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The incidence difficult tracheal intubation routine anaesthesia general population around 3-18 % although varies [ 1 ] . Awake intubation consider situation patient know suspected difficult airway , upper airway obstruction . Awake intubation local anaesthesia sedation also indicate cervical spine disease view minimise movement cervical spine [ 2 ] . Any technique tracheal intubation general anaesthesia involve degree movement cervical spine . Direct laryngoscopy tracheal intubation general anaesthesia usually achieve flexion lower cervical spine extension atlanto-occipital joint [ 3 ] . Difficulties failure airway management still important factor morbidity mortality relate anaesthesia . In recent year videolaryngoscopes use alternative traditional fibreoptic scope management difficult airway [ 4,7,8 ] . Over last 2 year institution investigator use Pentax AWS videolaryngoscope awake intubation patient present surgery cervical spine disease [ 9 , 10 ] . However study compare flexible fibreoptic scope video laryngoscopes management difficult airway awake patient . The propose benefit Pentax AWS ( Airway scope ) flexible fibreoptic scope include ease set device , less complexity skill , therefore easy learn skill availability disposable device minimise need clean disinfect device . Pentax AWS PBlade videolaryngoscope unique target symbol display monitor , highlight intend path endotracheal tube . The Pentax PBlade single patient use device minimizes risk infection . Study Design Methods : Randomised Controlled Trial Patient Selection : Forty patient present cervical spine surgery general anaesthesia require oral endotracheal intubation invite take part study . During preoperative visit , patient information sheet give patient meet eligible criterion . The patient give adequate time read information sheet query answer . Wherever possible , suitable patient identify preoperative assessment clinic . A detailed airway assessment perform one investigator . Whenever possible , patient admit night operation , see Anaesthetist give study information . Techniques Anaesthesia : After secure intravenous cannulation institute standard anaesthetic monitoring ECG , pulse oximetry non-invasive blood pressure monitoring , conscious sedation start use target control infusion remifentanil 1 mg midazolam . At stage numbered opaque envelope open choose one two device . The tongue , oropharynx larynx anaesthetise use 4 % lignocaine use Mckenzie technique ( nebulisation local anaesthetic 20 G cannula ) . Adequate anaesthesia upper airway check insert appropriately size oropharyngeal airway ( patient tolerate well , airway anesthetise adequately , local anaesthetic administer oropharynx ) . After confirm adequate anaesthesia upper airway , chosen device insert oropharynx . Further local anaesthesia base tongue , larynx trachea administer use spray go technique local anaesthetic administer device whilst gradually advance device towards larynx . After confirm position tracheal tube test gross neurological state 4 limb , general anaesthesia induce . Data Collection : During procedure laryngoscopy endotracheal intubation , modify intubation difficulty score ( IDS ) would develop base parameter record . Along intubation difficulty score parameter compare include : time take complete process intubation , anaesthetist rating intubation patient rating procedure . The following parameter would record score : 1 . Coughing episode : 0 cough 1 mild cough , 2 moderate cough , 3 severe cough . 2 . Gagging episode : 0 gagging , 1 mild gag , 2 moderate gag , 3 severe gag . 3 . Ease insertion device : 0 easy , 1 mild difficulty 2 moderately difficulty , 3 difficult . 4 . Laryngoscope view base percentage glottis visualise 0 75-100 % view , 1 50-75 % view , 2 &lt; 50 % view , 3 VC visible . 5 . Tube rotation manipulation , 0 rotation require , 1 rotation require 6 . Airway trauma , 0 trauma , 1 minor injury ( lip ) , 2 oro-pharyngeal injury/ bleeding . 3 , bleed require use suction 7 . Stress response base heart rate blood pressure ( 0 stable , 1 increase 20 % ) 8 . Overall patient ' tolerance judge Anaesthetists ( visual analogue score 0 100mm ) 9 . Overall impression patient visual analogue scale ( visual analogue score 0 100mm )</detailed_description>
