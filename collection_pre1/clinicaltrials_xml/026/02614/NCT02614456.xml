	<brief_title>Combination Interferon-gamma Nivolumab Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I study combination immunotherapy IFN-γ PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab patient advance solid tumor progress least one prior systemic therapy , may include prior immunotherapy . Patients treat one week induction phase ( IP ) IFN-γ , follow combination phase ( CP ) IFN-γ nivolumab three cycle , follow single agent phase nivolumab one year . The study primarily assess safety tolerability combination . Tumor assessment occur three cycle combination therapy , every three cycle thereafter . Secondary objective include ORR , PFS , OS also assess , various correlative analysis . Initial accrual occur use modify 6+6 design , endpoint safety ( use DLT criterion ) meet , expansion cohort RCC UC open 15 patient .</detailed_description>
