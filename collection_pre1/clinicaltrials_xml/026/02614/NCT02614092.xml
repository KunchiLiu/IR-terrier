	<brief_summary>This two-year study evaluate feasibility exercise training augmentation cognitive training intervention improve memory performance Veterans diagnosis amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment ( aMCI ) . This two-phased trial : 1 ) exercise phase 2 ) cognitive training program . The exercise phase aquatic base exercise program . A combination exercise cognitive training program design person without cognitive impairment significantly improve memory single intervention group ( exercise , cognitive training ) give success combination train program healthy old adult , important adapt program person begin exhibit clinically significant memory problem , aMCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary research question propose study : Is combination water-based physical exercise + cognitive training program old Veterans amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) feasible ? The primary aim propose research : 1 ) demonstrate adequate recruitment retention rate ; 2 ) refinement inclusion/exclusion criterion ; 3 ) refine combination waterbased physical exercise + cognitive training ( WATER+CT ) intervention . These aim test two-phase clinical trial single group design : 1 ) exercise training phase 2 ) cognitive training phase . The exercise training phase consist water-based physical exercise program emphasize cardiovascular fitness strength train combination non-weight bearing exercise include land-based stretch water-based activity . This 2-year pilot project include 50 Veterans diagnose amnestic MCI age 50-90 . The exercise component consist six-month water-based exercise program follow four-week cognitive training program . For first two month water-based exercise program , Veterans come thrice-weekly group session Aquatic Therapy Center VA Palo Alto Health Care System . This transition self-paced exercise program remain four month . After completion exercise program , Veterans begin classroom-based cognitive training VA Palo Alto Health Care System ( VAPAHCS ) . The cognitive training base efficacious cognitive program structure around two component , pre-training mnemonic training , use successfully person aMCI . Assessments adherence administer throughout treatment measure feasibility complete post-treatment . Participants complete variety neuropsychological measure tap area cognition attention , executive functioning , memory . To study possible predictor treatment response , investigator also collect biological ( cardiovascular functioning brain derive neurotrophic factor [ BDNF ] plasma level ) genetic data ( APOE BDNF genotype ) participant . The investigator hope provide initial evidence feasibility waterbased exercise training augmentation cognitive training thus lay groundwork full-scale clinical trial target lessen cognitive impairment person amnestic MCI non-pharmacological mean .</detailed_description>
