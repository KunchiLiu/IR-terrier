	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Imagery With Indocyanine Green</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According World Health Organization , lung cancer common cause cancer-related death men woman , responsible 1.3 million death worldwide annually 2004 . Surgery remain best option patient present operable Stage I II cancer , however five year survival rate candidate remain dismal 53 % Stage I 32 % Stage II ( 1 ) . The high rate recurrence suggest surgeon unable completely detect remove primary tumor nodule satisfactory manner well linger metastasis sentinel lymph node . By ensure negative margin near-infrared imagery would possible u improve rate recurrence free patient thus overall survival . The use ICG probe allow operating field lung tissue observe real-time . ICG use clinical setting since 1957 . There wealth data available attest safety drug inject current clinically indicated dose level . ICG show preferentially uptake esophageal tumor oppose surround epithelial lumen one minute IV exposure ( 2 ) . Additionally , group report able good characterize vascularization tumor clarify invasiveness cancer . ICG usage show safe similar clinical setting Gotoh group , use ICG detect characterize bullous emphysematous lesion lung video assist thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) Infrared Thoracoscopy previously detectable white light ( 3 ) . The currently propose trial single center , open-label pilot/observational cohort study . Patients diagnosis resectable thoracic nodule/mass presume resectable via minimally invasive surgery determine pre-operative assessment Hospital University Pennsylvania include .</detailed_description>
