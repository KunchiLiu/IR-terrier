	<brief_summary>To answer question : `` Do Prontosan instillations decrease time wound fracture heal decrease bacterial load compare wound vac treatment without Prontosan ? , '' enroll 30 subject ( anticipated 20 complete data set ) trial . The subject split equally two different group randomization . One group wound vac therapy Prontosan , one group wind vac therapy without Prontosan . Data relate wound fracture heal bacterial load assess two group determine wound vac therapy Prontosan speed healing time decrease bacterial load .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection ( SSIs ) devastate relatively common surgical complication , occur 2 % 5 % patient undergoing surgery United States . SSIs significantly increase patient morbidity , hospital stay duration , healthcare cost , patient mortality ( Anderson 2011 ) . Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT ) Vacuum-Assisted Closure ( VAC ) establish adjunctive treatment option open wound offer ability promote healing . However , limited evidence utility active infection . Wounds acutely infected contain adherent biofilm present challenging problem ( Kim et al 2015 ) . Wound VAC therapy involve clean wound , apply custom-fit foam cover wound , place transparent drape wound adjacent skin , attach tube connect foam VAC suction canister . NPWT achieve pull force supply VAC suction canister . Typically , suction remain constant pressure dress remove . Continuous VAC therapy recently report effective standard moist wound care surgical site infection ankle surgery ( Zhou et al . 2015 ) . VAC therapy instillation novel treatment option provide combination negative pressure intermittent instillation solution . Polihexanide ( Prontosan速 ) modern antiseptic combine broad antimicrobial spectrum low toxicity , high tissue compatibility , report adsorption good applicability solution , gel , ointment , foam wound dress . Unlike antiseptic , antimicrobial efficacy Prontosan速 impair human wound fluid , human tissue high load blood albumin . Furthermore , Prontosan速 block microbial attachment surface show effectively remove biofilms vitro vivo ( Hubner et al 2010 ) .</detailed_description>
