	<detailed_description>The investigator propose conduct multi-center open-label randomize control trial ass early intervention ( 12.0-14.0 week ) ( study group ) improve outcome TRAP sequence compare late intervention ( 16.0-19.0 week ) ( control group ) . The investigator randomly assign woman diagnose TRAP sequence diagnose 11.6 13.6 week ( 1:1 ) early late intervention group , use web-based application ( www.sealedenvelope.com ) computer-generated list random permute block size 2 4 , stratify gestational age inclusion ( 11.6 -12.6 week versus 13.0-13.6 week ) . Analysis intention-to-treat . Outcome adjudicate blind group allocation . All intervention do local anaesthesia and/or conscious sedation sterile condition experience operator . They must perform within 1 week randomisation late 14.0 week early group 19.0 week late group . In early group , intrafetal coagulation use . Intrafetal ablation perform ultrasound guidance use 18-gauge ( 1.27 mm ) 20-gauge ( 0.91 mm ) needle free-hand technique . The needle introduce pelvis/abdomen TRAP mass close intra-abdominal portion feed vessel , avoid puncture placenta pump twin sac . The procedure consider successful complete cessation reverse flow TRAP mass intraoperative color-flow mapping . In late intervention/control group either intrafetal coagulation fetoscopic laser coagulation perform cord and/or anastomose vessel , unless flow stop spontaneously demise pump twin occur meantime . Intrafetal coagulation do describe use 17-gauge ( 1.47 mm ) 20-gauge needle . Alternatively , fetoscopic laser coagulation cord anastomose vessel perform 17-gauge 7 French trocar 1-1,3 mm fetoscope 400 Î¼m laser fiber . The rationale standardize technique late intervention group several technique report treatment 16 week without significant difference outcome . Also , usual surgeon adapt technique requirement individual case , e.g . posterior placenta , surgeon may prefer fetoscopic rather intrafetal coagulation . Not restrict technique 1 option therefore truly represent current practice increase generalizability trial 's finding . Patients discharge day 1 day procedure . Management follow-up similar study control current practice group . A follow-up scan usually perform 1 week intervention check fetal well-being exclude anemia . A detailed ultrasound scan arrange fetal medicine center 20 30 week assess heart brain anatomy . Some center may offer MRI scan around 30 week part protocol monochorionic twin pregnancy underwent intrauterine intervention . Antenatal , peripartum postnatal care mother similar singleton pregnancy discretion refer physician . Intrauterine intervention TRAP sequence indication cesarean elective preterm birth .</detailed_description>
