	<brief_title>Encouraging Mail Order Pharmacy Use Improve Outcomes Reduce Disparities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adherence effective cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor medication associate improved CVD risk factor control , few hospitalization , low mortality patient diabetes . However , many patient poorly adherent medication , persistent racial/ethnic socioeconomic disparity medication adherence . Traditional clinical trial intervention improve medication adherence often resource-intensive , focus exclusively patient-level barrier behavior change . Unsurprisingly , trial lead sustainable , cost-effective approach improve adherence . Health system-level medication adherence intervention implement , `` scale , '' sustain across wide range health care delivery setting urgently need . The investigator propose randomize encouragement trial encourage use exist mail order pharmacy service among diabetes patient poor adherence CVD risk factor medication use retail pharmacy 3 health care system : Kaiser Permanente Northern California , Harvard Pilgrim , Kaiser Permanente Hawaii . These combined system include approximately 300,000 patient diabetes diverse racial/ethnic socioeconomic background . Patients history mail order pharmacy use randomize 3 arm . In addition examine impact intervention medication adherence CVD risk factor control , investigator examine factor affect sustainability dissemination intervention , assess intervention 's impact utilization health care cost , determine whether intervention 's impact differs across racial/ethnic socioeconomic subgroup . This research provide foundation develop sustainable , system-level approach address medication adherence diabetes patient widely disseminate implement across diverse array health care system .</detailed_description>
