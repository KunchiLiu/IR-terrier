	<brief_title>Electric Blower Based Ventilator Used During Procedural Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All study procedure perform adult patient follow informed consent endoscopy suite University Utah Health Sciences Center Salt Lake City , Utah . A ventilation mask place patient 's face connect ventilator . Supplemental oxygen deliver ventilator mask ; concentration oxygen deliver leave clinician 's discretion . A modified mask multiple small leak use standard elastomeric H-strap secure patient 's face . The endoscopy suite nurse technician attach clinically necessary standard sensor connect patient monitoring system . Height , weight , neck circumference measure record digitally encrypt laptop . In addition standard care monitor , investigator collect data additional non-invasive modality save data laptop use custom software later analysis . Pressure flow sensor include ventilator use monitor patient ' tidal volume respiratory rate procedure . The data collect recorded laptop include : RIP data , mask pressure , flow , breath rate . An additional flow sensor place line ventilator . The objective study threefold : Demonstrate patient undergoing procedural sedation ( e.g. , colonoscopy ) obstructive apnea successfully avoid stenting airway open use CPAP , demonstrate successfully detect period zero ventilation , demonstrate functionality modify standard mask .</detailed_description>
