	<brief_summary>Background : Cell therapy experimental cancer therapy . It take young tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( Young TIL ) cell person tumor grow lab . Then return person . Researchers think add drug pembrolizumab might make therapy effective . Objective : To test add pembrolizumab cell therapy safe effective shrink melanoma tumor . Eligibility : People age 18 70 year metastatic melanoma Design : Participants screen : Physical exam CT , MRI , PET scan X-rays Heart lung function test Blood urine test Before treatment , participant : A piece tumor take biopsy surgery order grow TIL cell Leukapheresis : Blood flow needle one arm machine remove white blood cell . The rest blood return needle arm . An IV catheter place chest get TIL cell , aldesleukin , pembrolizumab ( assign ) Participants stay hospital treatment . This include : Daily chemotherapy 1 week For participant , pembrolizumab infusion 1 day chemotherapy TIL cell infusion 2 4 day chemotherapy , aldesleukin infusion every 8 hour 12 dos Possible filgrastim injection Recovery 1 2 week After treatment , participant : Take antibiotic antiviral least 6 month If assign , pembrolizumab treatment every 3 week 3 dos . They may another round . Have 2-day follow-up visit every 1 3 month 1 year every 6 month</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Phase 2 Trial Metastatic Melanoma Using Adoptive Cell Therapy With Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Plus IL-2 Either Alone Following Administration Pembrolizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Adoptive cell therapy ( ACT ) use autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) mediate regression bulky metastatic melanoma administer along high-dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine . - Pembrolizumab , monoclonal antibody bind PD-1 block PD-1/PD-L1 axis , facilitate activity anti-tumor lymphocytes tumor micro environment . Pembrolizumab administration result objective tumor response patient metastatic melanoma approve use FDA treatment patient . - Administered TIL express low level PD-1 , though PD-1 re-expressed TIL vivo follow TIL administration - In pre-clinical model , administration anti-PD1 antibody enhance anti-tumor activity transfer T-cells . Objectives : - To determine prospective randomize trial whether addition pembrolizumab standard non-myeloablative conditioning regimen , TIL high dose IL-2 improve complete response rate patient metastatic melanoma receive prior anti PD-1/PD-L1 therapy ( Cohort 1 ) - To determine complete response rate standard non-myeloablative conditioning regimen , TIL , high dose IL-2 combination pembrolizumab patient metastatic melanoma receive prior therapy anti PD-1/PD-L1 ( Cohort 2 ) Eligibility : - Age great equal 16 less equal 70 year - Evaluable metastatic melanoma - Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable surgical resection preparation TIL - No contraindication high-dose aldesleukin administration - No concurrent major medical illness form immunodeficiency Design : - Patients metastatic melanoma lesion resect TIL - Patients assign 2 cohort : - Cohort 1 patient refractory treatment anti PD-1/PD-L1 - Cohort 2 patient receive treatment PD-1/PD-L1 - After TIL growth establish : - Patients assign Cohort 1 randomize either receive receive pembrolizumab combination standard Adoptive Cell Therapy ( ACT ) TIL ( non-myeloablative conditioning regimen , TIL high dose IL-2 ) - Patients assign Cohort 2 receive standard ACT TIL combination pembrolizumab - Pembrolizumab administer immediately prior TIL administration continue 3 additional cycle . - Up 170 patient may enrol 3-4 year .</detailed_description>
