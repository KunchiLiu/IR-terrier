	<brief_title>Feasibility IPL Reducing Dry Eye Symptoms Caused MGD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IPL module FDA clearance ( K142860 ) wide range indication , include benign cavernous hemangioma , benign venous malformation , telangiectasia , port-wine stain , pigment lesion erythema rosacea . As show retrospective study , 85 % case , use IPL subject ocular rosacea also alleviate symptom DED cause MGD . No serious adverse event record , suggest IPL therapy administer close ocular orbit safe ( provided eye shield ) . However , mention study retrospective . Therefore , additional evidence need order substantiate hypothesis alleviation MGD symptom facilitate IPL treatment . The aim current study ass safety efficacy IPL treatment reduce symptom dry eye disease ( DED ) subject MGD . The study hypothesis study population subject diagnose moderate severe MGD , 4 session IPL therapy M22 system , follow expression MGs , cause significant increase tear break-up time post-treatment , compare pre-treatment .</detailed_description>
