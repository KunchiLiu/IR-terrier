	<brief_summary>A novel hand hold hybrid optical-gamma camera ( hereinafter refer `` camera '' ) develop use image radiotracer distribution patient bedside . This study aim evaluate image capability camera patient attend surgery sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) procedure . It anticipate could improve accuracy simplify sentinel lymph node detection provide fused optical gamma imaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single centre prospective , non-randomised non-blinded research project use camera operate theatre addition standard gamma surgical probe assess lymph node involvement breast cancer patient undergo surgery disease . The duration study 1 year . The purpose trial determine camera use localisation sentinel lymph node SLNB procedure compare detection rate sentinel lymph node ( ) standard method use gamma probe . Study Plan : This study alter standard SLNB procedure provide healthcare provider . The camera use acquire image axillary parasternal region additional step standard SLNB procedure . No invasive action perform . Images obtain use camera study include gamma , optical fuse gamma/optical image acquisition . In additional intraoperative imaging study use camera system , subjective assessment questionnaire carry amongst surgeon obtain feedback . Statistics : For quantitative analysis , distribution continuous variable summarise use mean standard deviation ( normally distribute ) median range ( normally distribute ) ; distribution categorical variable summarise present number percentage fall category . Missing data record . SPSS use manage data . The detection rate detection method ( camera versus standard technique ) tabulate binary data ( yes/no ) . Validity analysis compute sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value negative predictive value . Also Kappa ( categorical data ) method use examine agreement two method . Good agreement claim value kappa 0.81 1.00 . Sample size : The calculated sample size 53 participant . It calculate use nQuery Advisor® 6.0 goal make conclusion use agreement . The sample size 80 % power pick ҡ1 = 0.410 great .</detailed_description>
