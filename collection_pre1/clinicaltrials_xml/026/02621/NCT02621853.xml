	<brief_summary>Fatty liver disease include liver steatosis ( fat deposition ) major health problem worldwide . It consider pathological fat accumulation exceed 5 % liver weight . Transplantation represent ultimate treatment end stage liver disease . However , discrepancy demand donor organ availability present one great hurdle liver transplantation . Therefore , extend criterion organ consider overcome shortcoming . Hepatic steatosis one important criterion define extended-criteria donor liver . In liver transplantation , 'severe ' fat deposition donor liver major cause graft failure 'mild ' deposition consider transplantable 'moderate ' deposition represent gray zone remain difficult ass . Surgeons usually perform hepatic steatosis assessment liver donor surgery . However , method subjective difficult especially inexperienced surgeon trainee concern . Furthermore , recently document assessment steatosis challenge even hand experience surgeon . Theoretically , good way assess steatosis organ procurement would non-invasive imaging technique . However , technique appear lack sensitivity accurately quantify hepatic fat content others complex , expensive inconvenient use set organ procurement . Therefore , liver biopsy remain reference grade hepatic steatosis . In daily practice assessment quantification steatosis pathologist organ procurement complex relate lack availability dedicate hepatopathologists outside office hour small community hospital . A simple short technique therefore require assess liver steatosis retrieval . We recently demonstrate Raman spectroscopy could provide accurate , rapid real-time assessment hepatic fat content correlate highly gold standard ( i.e . histopathological assessment liver section ) animal model liver steatosis . The purpose study validate use Raman spectroscopy quantitative assessment hepatic steatosis . In hands surgeon device provide immediate , robust tool ass suitability donor liver site retrieval prior liver transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Validation Raman Spectroscope Determine Hepatic Fat Content</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently three main method report assess liver steatosis decease donor liver retrieval : Noninvasive imaging technique , evaluation liver biopsy sample experience pathologist assessment transplant surgeon . Imaging technique currently use include ultrasonography ( USG ) , computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Although acceptable level sensitivity , USG provide reproducible quantitative information . It use center operator dependent . Likewise , diagnostic performance non-enhanced CT scan accurate quantification steatosis unreliable . MRI highly sensitive specific diagnose hepatic steatosis report fat quantification use 3.0-T MRI provide sufficient sensitivity detect quantify steatosis live liver donor candidate . However , complex technology limit use routine organ procurement . The microscopic evaluation liver biopsy sample expert pathologist gold standard steatosis assessment . The presence type steatosis determine microscopic evaluation . The grade steatosis determine accord international standard . Despite gold standard , biopsy record 23 % transplanted liver United States . Since pathologist always available time procurement , many center rely mainly assessment steatosis organ quality procurement surgeon ( i.e . transplant surgeon ) . During assessment donor liver evaluate accord parenchymal texture criterion degree yellowness ( normal , mild , moderate , severe ) degree firmness ( soft , normal ; mild , moderate , severe ) . However , study investigate accurately transplant surgeon could predict hepatic steatosis conclude assessment could significantly mislead even experienced hand . Since three method limitation , need convenient simple technique well ass hepatic fat content prior transplantation . Raman spectroscopy inelastic light scatter technique sensitive molecular vibration , symmetry frequency unique type atom spatial arrangement . Sensitivity property basis ability provide spectral fingerprint molecule illuminate region . It use detect amino acid , nucleotide base , fatty acid , saccharide , primary metabolite constituent form protein , carbohydrate , fat DNA/RNA biological tissue . It attractive technology bioanalysis sample preparation need . Raman spectroscopy currently investigation use clinical setting carry mainly diagnostic purpose . It currently approve use Canada skin cancer diagnosis . There variety different Raman spectroscopy system . We recently design high throughput Raman spectroscopy system small others , portable robust . It enable situ scan tissue undertaken little experience require operator . This system use 'near infrared ( NIR ) excitation wavelength improve penetration depth laser reduce possibility tissue damage . It give information form Raman spectrum , analysis give Principal Component ( PC ) score . This specially design system could accurately quantify steatosis mouse rat liver . The PC score exhibit significant correlation histopathological examination result . Since steatosis human liver tissue exhibit change similar leave liver lobe mouse rat , conclude technique could apply field transplantation . Clinical validation subsequent adoption technique provide transplant specialist valuable tool obtain real time information severity hepatic steatosis ass likelihood successful outcome reduce inadvertent organ discard rate . OBJECTIVE The aim study validate Raman spectroscopy ( mean specially design high throughput fiber optic Raman system ) clinical set assessment hepatic fat content . The vivo Raman spectrum ( PC score ) compare finding pre-operative image method ( MRI-fat quantification ) current gold standard , liver biopsy ( i.e . histopathological assessment liver specimen ) . SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1 . Can Raman spectroscopy utilize portable fiber optic system rapidly assess fat content liver situ clinical setting ? 2 . Do Raman spectra ( principal component score ) correlate well finding MRI-fat quantification histopathological assessment liver biopsy specimen ? STUDY DESIGN : This study conceive single-centre , prospective validation study . METHODS Partial liver resection surgical removal portion liver . Most partial liver resection perform treatment hepatic neoplasm . Patients undergo open partial liver resection surgery institution review circle care team approach consent deem suitable study . A Nova Scotia Health Authority Research Ethics Board-approved inform consent form utilized consent discussion ( run clinical fellow research associate- investigator participate project ) patient provide time read document full ask decision participation . Patients give consent study assign study group . Assignment process continue 25 patient include . Study participant undergo pre-operative MRI fat quantification . They ask fast least 8 hour prior MRI . Fat quantification technique ( proton density fat fraction technique ) perform use IDEAL pulse sequence , Health Canada approve assessment hepatic fat fraction , 3.0-T MR unit ( GE 750 ; GE Healthcare ) . An attend fellowship train abdominal radiologist experience MR image interpretation measure hepatic fat fraction ( FF ) FF map , generate automatically . The automatically calculate hepatic FF display percentage full scale 0-100 . During liver resection procedure region specimen remove actual lesion illuminate Raman spectroscope fiber-optic probe . The Raman spectrum provide record real-time ( within second ) subsequently analyze ( principal component analysis ) . This analysis provide PC score . Following application Raman spectroscopy operative procedure continue plan . Histochemical stain , H &amp; E ( hematoxylin-eosin ) trichrome , routinely use interpretation liver specimens anatomic pathology laboratory . As special stain Oil Red O need use demonstrate presence extent fat ( i.e . fat quantification ) liver tissue . Since perform frozen section frozen section obtain remove liver specimen section allow Oil Red O staining- specific diagnose quantify fat droplet . An attend pathologist blind MRI finding evaluate section determine grade steatosis per international standard : M0 : macrovesicular steatosis M1 : mild focal macrovesicular steatosis ( &lt; 30 % hepatocytes involve ) M2 : moderate , zonal macrovesicular steatosis ( &gt; 30 &lt; 60 % hepatocytes involve ) M3 : severe , panlobular macrovesicular steatosis ( &gt; 60 % hepatocytes involve ) Correlation analysis perform hepatic FF percentage , PC score steatosis grade study participant . Study participant follow surgery accord standard post-liver resection follow-up protocol without deviation standard care . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS For statistical analysis , quantitative data express mean standard deviation qualitative data express number . Linear regression perform macrovesicular steatosis grade hepatic FF percentage PC score .
