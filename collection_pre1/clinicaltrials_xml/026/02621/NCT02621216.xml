	<detailed_description>Rationale : Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) become mainstay treatment acute coronary artery disease number patient receive PCI vastly grow . Clinical trial report efficacy effect quality life mortality . Guidelines construct PCI treatment well cardiovascular prevention . However , relatively little long-term follow-up study large real-world clinical sample exist look real-world effect PCI treatment adherence current guideline . Moreover , psychological risk factor important determine prognosis PCI , undergo PCI may increase risk low mood . To date , study examine single psychological risk factor , without take account relatedness . Moreover , guideline advocate psychosocial screen early cardiovascular disease , screen test propose ESC Prevention guideline yet validate test . Although detrimental effect psychological risk factor cardiovascular prognosis know , mechanism exert effect yet unclear . It expect one multiple biological ( inflammation , endothelial dysfunction ) behavioural ( cop style , poor self-care , consultation behaviour ) pathological process play role , process interact . In PCI patient , mechanism link psychological risk poor prognosis still investigate . Objective : ( 1 ) To examine adherence prevention PCI guideline effect thereof long term prognosis PCI patient . ( 2 ) To examine effect cluster psychological risk factor several network potentially mediate mechanism long term outcomes large sample PCI patient . ( 3 ) To evaluate effectiveness psychosocial screen instrument European Society Cardiology Prevention guideline 2012 . Study design : Prospective observational cohort study . Study population : All patient age &gt; 18 admit TweeSteden hospital percutaneous coronary intervention eligible . Main study parameters/endpoints : Predictors : Psychological ( risk ) factor ( depression , anxiety , Type D personality , mindfulness , positive mood ) , Adherence ; Outcome variable : PCI complication , hospitalization , event . Potential mediator : inflammatory biomarkers , marker endothelial dysfunction , physical stress recovery ) Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The risk associate current study low . For mechanistic observational study , investigator ask patient fill two extensive ( 20 page ) several small ( 12-15 page ) psychological survey include among others question personality , positive negative mood , mindfulness , work stress , satisfaction life . Preferably , questionnaire administer digitally email link . In addition , subsample three additional fast blood sample draw assess study-specific marker , two coincide regular blood draw clinic . There direct benefit participation , provide data create knowledge improve future treatment .</detailed_description>
