	<brief_title>A Proposed Intervention Decrease Resident-Performed Cataract Surgery Cancellation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cataract surgery commonly perform eye surgery US , vital ophthalmology resident high quality cataract surgery experience supervise training year . This allow trainee feel comfortable perform ocular surgery managing associate complication variety clinical setting . Aspiring ophthalmologist desire high level surgical comfort competence , often time , prospective applicant residency program use surgical volume quality training , particularly cataract surgery , surrogate measure overall quality residency program . This encourage residency program provide robust surgical experience possible . Residency program provide various level exposure cataract surgery training , provide surgical stimulators wet lab , resident practice surgical maneuver pig cow eye . These study show use device improve resident 's operative skill level , translate great efficiency lower intra-operative complication rate . While practice wet labs surgical stimulation clearly beneficial , substitute direct experience perform cataract surgery operating room . Complication rate resident-performed cataract surgery find drop 50 % resident 's first 40 case . A study evaluate first 3000 phacoemulsification procedure experience surgeon find substantial decrease rate major complication first 100 procedure . Another study investigate first 1000 phacoemulsification case perform experienced surgeon find 8.4 % decrease major minor complication first 150 case ( 9.3 % 0.9 % ) . Therefore , critical ophthalmology residency program provide robust clinical cataract curriculum affords resident ability maximize surgical exposure experience . Substantial exposure however , prevented high rate cancellation cataract surgery . This widespread phenomenon see various eye care institution . A study eye surgery cancel ambulatory surgicenter Boston find 5.3 % cancellation rate within 24 hour procedure , leading loss least $ 100,000 per year 41 % cancellation consider preventable . Case cancellation data 123 Veterans Administration ( VA ) facility throughout 2006 show 9 % cancellation rate ophthalmic surgery , 35 % cancellation due `` patient factor '' follow 28 % due `` work up/medical condition change '' . A prior study Wills Eye Hospital find 1,083 surgery schedule Cataract Primary Eye Care Clinic ( CPEC ) 7/1/11 6/3/0/12 , 319 ( 29.5 % ) cancel . Of cancellation , 72 % cancel within 7 day procedure , permit enough time reassign operate room slot . Internal economic analysis Wills estimate lose reimbursement cancellation $ 607,946 , $ 391,884 lose revenue facility fee . Additionally , relative loss 230 resident surgical experience 28.75 surgery miss per resident . Considered together , finding mean Wills Eye Hospital reach full clinical economic potential provide cataract surgery experience ; specifically , institution function 86 % capacity cataract surgery procedure . It apparent high rate cataract surgery cancellation affect teach hospital academically economically . There cost resident lose valuable experience , attend staff , institution whole . The prior study also reveal common reason cataract surgery cancellation patient ' failure complete pre-admission testing ( PAT ) . While routine pre-operative testing support otherwise healthy patient undergo elective non-cardiac surgery , test use provide baseline , elicit preventative measure minimize post-operative risk . Improvement pre-admission test process modifiable therefore present opportunity intervention . Other modifiable reason cancellation include lack transportation , failure remember eat night procedure . Past experience Wills indicate roughly 1100 resident cataract surgery schedule year . The cancellation rate similar period time determine Assessing Cancellation Rates Barriers Completion Resident Performed Cataract Surgery Wills Eye Hospital 29.45 % , approximately 320 cancellation per year . The investigator propose test intervention address modifiable reason cancellation . Patients randomize either 1 ) intervention group on-site pre-admission test mandate 2 ) control group , on-site pre-admission testing offer mandate . The intervention couple personalized patient communication appropriately time scheduled procedure . Multiple study show schedule pre-operative visitation assessment enhance communication physician patient contribute decrease cancellation surgery . It find anesthesia-run pre-operative clinic visit significantly decrease cancellation delay same-day surgery . Additionally , old patient find great decrease cancellation rate preoperative anesthesia clinic visit . At VA facility throughout America , surgeon low cancellation rate site report high use write preoperative instruction pre-operative clinic visit . Cancellation rate collect prospectively statistical analysis utilized evaluate significance intervention .</detailed_description>
