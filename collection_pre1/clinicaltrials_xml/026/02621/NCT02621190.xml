	<detailed_description>Rationale : After failure docetaxel , standard first line therapy patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , several treatment option currently available . Two treatment option direct androgen receptor ( AR ) , enzalutamide abiraterone . A third option cabazitaxel , next generation taxane . No head-to-head comparison do three therapy second-line mCRPC yet , optimal choice unknown . Resistance AR-targeted therapy least part consequence signal constitutively active AR splice variant ( AR-Vs ) . Because AR splice variant occur conversion castration-resistant tumor , acquire systemic therapy mCRPC , analysis castration-naïve primary tumor informative set second-line treatment mCRPC . Circulating tumor cell ( CTCs ) analyze repetitively real-time . Recently , AR-V7 mRNA expression CTCs show associated lack response AR-targeted therapy . AR-V7 mRNA expression seem hind response cabazitaxel investigator 's retrospective pilot study recently publish small retrospective study . Therefore investigator hypothesize mRNA expression AR-V7 CTCs assess start second-line treatment mCRPC affect PSA response rate cabazitaxel patient progress docetaxel . Objective : The primary objective study explore PSA response rate cabazitaxel mCRPC patient progress docetaxel detectable AR-V7 expression CTCs . Exploratory objectives include document PSA response cabazitaxel enzalutamide abiraterone treatment initially AR-V7 negative patient , describe toxicity cabazitaxel second third-line treatment well explore response measure CTC count PSA relate systemic cabazitaxel exposure . Study design : This multicenter , non-randomized phase 2 study . Patients allocate one follow treatment group accord result CTC enumeration characterization screen phase : Group A : Patients &lt; 3 CTCs patient ≥3 CTCs without AR-V7 expression receive physician 's choice treatment Group B : Patients ≥3 CTCs AR-V7 expression receive Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² every 3 week plus prednisone 10 mg daily . Patients group A treat enzalutamide abiraterone experience disease progression , enter screen phase , additional eligibility check , subsequently treat cabazitaxel group B ≥3 CTCs present AR-V7 mRNA expression detect . These patient re-included study . Study population : Adult mCRPC patient , age≥18 year , progress docetaxel treatment . Prior enzalutamide abiraterone treatment permit . Intervention : In patient , 2 x 10 mL blood drawn enumeration isolation CTCs baseline . In group B , cabazitaxel administrate intravenously dose 25 mg/m² , one-hour infusion every 3 week , well continuous treatment prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily , 10 mg daily , accord standard care . In patient , additional 2 x 10 mL blood draw second cycle treatment CTC enumeration isolation . In group B , additional 10 mL blood drawn storage plasma baseline start every every cycle ( i.e. , every 3 week ) analysis cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ) part side-study . In group B , also 4 x 5 mL blood ( baseline ; end infusion , 2 6 hour end first cabazitaxel infusion ) draw pharmacokinetic side-study , explore cabazitaxel exposure effect relation . Patients group A treat accord physician 's choice . In group A , additional 10 mL blood drawn storage plasma baseline , 12 week start treatment upon progression enzalutamide abiraterone analyse cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ) part side-study . Patients group A receive abiraterone enzalutamide subsequently experience disease progression enter screen phase study , eligible , include group B . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : For CTC enumeration isolation , total 40 mL additional blood drawn time regular blood draw ( treatment group A : 1 x 20 mL baseline 1 x 20 mL upon progression enzalutamide abiraterone ; treatment group B : 1 x 20 mL baseline 1 x 20 mL second cycle cabazitaxel ) . For storage plasma cfDNA analysis , total 100 mL additional blood drawn time regular blood draw ( baseline treatment cycle ) patient group B . In group A , storage plasma cfDNA analysis , total 30 mL additional blood drawn time regular blood draw ( baseline , 12 week start treatment upon disease progression ) . For pharmacokinetic analysis , patient group B , total 20 mL ( 4 x 5 mL ) additional blood drawn baseline , end infusion , 2 6 hour first cabazitaxel infusion . Cabazitaxel standard second-line chemotherapy mCRPC patient . In TROPIC trial , common observe grade 3-4 toxicity neutropenia ( 82 % ) . Despite high incidence neutropenia , febrile neutropenia rare ( 8 % ) . The frequent non-hematologic adverse event ( AE ) diarrhea , occur 47 % ( grade ≥3 6 % ) patient treat cabazitaxel , compare 11 % ( grade ≥3 &lt; 1 % ) patient treat mitoxantrone . In TROPIC trial , total 18 ( 5 % ) patient treat cabazitaxel die within 1 month last drug infusion due adverse effect . This compare 3 drug-related death ( 2 % ) mitoxantrone group . The common cause death patient treat cabazitaxel neutropenia clinical consequence . The frequency hematological adverse event related death demonstrate cabazitaxel treatment require careful monitoring management emerge symptom . Dose reduction well supportive treatment ( i.e . administration granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [ G-CSF ] ) consider manage toxic effect treatment . Patients group B schedule study visit frequently , accordance standard-of-care cabazitaxel treatment . Patients return regularly schedule study visit long continue study treatment , discontinue study treatment yet experienced disease progression . All patient follow survival discontinuing treatment . For primary endpoint , serial blood sample collect every three week quantify PSA . Radiographic evaluation ( bone scan CT/MRI-scans abdomen pelvis ) employ four eight cycle cabazitaxel assess status disease accord modify RECIST 1.1 criterion . The safety cabazitaxel second third-line treatment assess monitoring frequency treatment relate ( serious ) adverse event , record accord Common Terminology Criteria ( CTCAE ) scale version 4.03 .</detailed_description>
