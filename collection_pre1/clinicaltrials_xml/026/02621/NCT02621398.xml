Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving pembrolizumab together paclitaxel , carboplatin , radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety toxicity anti-programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) inhibition pembrolizumab concurrent chemoradiation therapy non-operable , locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate local control distant metastasis-free survival , progression-free overall survival addition pembrolizumab chemoradiotherapy . II . To evaluate rate pneumonitis may result combination pembrolizumab chemoradiotherapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PDL1 ) status immunohistochemistry predictive response pembrolizumab combine chemoradiation therapy . II . To assess T cell ( cluster differentiation 8 positive [ CD8+ ] T cell CD4+ forkhead box P3 positive [ FoxP3+ ] regulatory cell ) responses week 1 , 3 , 6 chemoradiation therapy administration pembrolizumab cycle 1 , 2 , 3 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study pembrolizumab . Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Patients undergo 3-dimensional ( 3D ) conformal radiation therapy ( CRT ) intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) daily ( QD ) 5 day week 6 week . Beginning 2-6 week , 2 week end , start chemotherapy radiation therapy , patient also receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment pembrolizumab repeat every 21 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week 1 year , every 16 week 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
