	<brief_summary>The effect nivolumab symptomatic brain metastasis currently unknown . This phase 2 clinical trial first evaluate intracranial effect human , aim give patient possibility treat anti-PD-1 . Besides objective response rate , long term benefit patient category evaluate measure survival term progression free survival overall survival . Furthermore safety tolerability administration drug patient symptomatic brain metastasis study , first study nivolumab specific patient category .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study open label , single arm , phase II clinical trial prospectively collect data evaluate efficacy safety nivolumab metastatic melanoma patient symptomatic brain metastasis . It conduct several study center Netherlands . Patients radiologic evidence brain metastasis eligible treatment nivolumab screen inclusion . All patient trial receive treatment nivolumab 24 month . Treatment discontinue confirmed disease progression demonstrate , unacceptable toxicity intercurrent illness prevents treatment , informed consent withdrawn . After discontinuation treatment , follow-up start . Duration follow-up depends survival patient , maximum 24 month . Therefore end study determine 24 month last patient trial start follow-up , die , withdraw consent lose follow-up different reason .</detailed_description>

At least one radiologic new lesion brain MRI , measurable RANOBM criterion ( long diameter ≥ 10 mm perpendicular diameter ≥ 5 mm ) . Lesions prior local treatment ( i.e. , SRT surgical resection ) consider measurable demonstrate progression since time local treatment . Leptomeningeal involvement allow , could use target lesion . 5 . BRAF status determine . If positive , initial treatment maximal 8 week BRAFinhibitors allow . 6 . Subjects must treatmentnaive nivolumab . ( also adjuvant treatment ) 7 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 01 . 8 . Subjects must adequate organ function define follow laboratory value ( determine within 28 day prior randomization/registration ) : White blood cell ( WBC ) ≥ 2000 /µL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500 /µL Platelets ≥ 100 x103 /µL Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ≥ 5.6 mmol/L Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min ( use CockcroftGault formula ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 time ULN Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time ULN ( Except patient Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL ) LDH &lt; 2 time ULN 9 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy test within 24 hour prior receive first administration nivolumab . Women nonchildbearing potential may include either surgically sterile postmenopausal ≥ 1 year . 10 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) men sexually active WOCBP must agree use appropriate method ( ) contraception . ( see section 5.2 ) 1 . Prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 antibody . ( also adjuvant treatment ) 2 . Subjects recover Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.0 grade 1 good adverse event due previous cancer therapy . 3 . Evidence active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger . 4 . Treatment corticosteroid increase dosage 7 day prior first administration nivolumab . ( A stable decreasing dosage ≤ 4 mg dexamethasone equivalent allow . In addition , inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos permit absence active autoimmune disease . ) 5 . Previous malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ bladder cancer , gastric colon cancer , cervical cancers/dysplasia breast carcinoma situ ) unless complete remission achieve least 1 year prior study entry additional therapy require anticipate required study period . 6 .
