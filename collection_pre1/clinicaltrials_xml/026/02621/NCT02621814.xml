	<detailed_description>1 . Sample size：Referring previous study Classic statistic textbook , sample size 100 case group , half male half female . Considering Lost lose follow-up exit , actual sample size 120 case group , 30 case ( 15baby boy , 15baby girl ) hospital . 2 . Data record 2.1 Original record : Subjects ' follow-up care card original file clinical trial duplicate . One copy save hospital . Original record shall traceable . Each researcher must strictly follow principle GCP . It must ensure record observation discovery follow-up care card case report form ( CRF ) .It must ensure data difference , get optional change . When make correction , must change original record , add description explain reason , correction need sign date . Case report form ( CRF ) : In triplicate , de deliver sponsor , main institution clinical research participate institution clinical research .Following principle GCP , subject ' name appear In order ensure privacy . Subjects ' name must fill initial . All project mark × □ . If inspection item examine reason , fill : examine . If specific formula dosage unknown , fill : unknown . When filled number , fill □ . If left side empty , fill 0.No null term miss item . Researchers must ensure data must consistent original record . If digit enough , fill right side . If left side empty , fill 0.No null term miss item . Researchers must ensure data must consistent original record . If modifying , draw horizontal line middle original record text , sidenote modify , sign name modifier date . He must smear cover original record . Data subject ' guardian : It record , accord design definition observational data table project . Extremum principle : The data , deviate significantly outside acceptable range clinically , must verify . Clinical doctor must make necessary instruction . Data registration preservation : Every time visit , researcher record require information case report timely . After end subject ' observed period , researcher accurately record relevant information form data CRF original data within 7 day . CRF , inform consent data examine sign project leader，then save archive office institution . If problem find , researcher Timely deal record . 2.2 Data monitoring Editorial Board Chinese Journal Evidence-Based Pediatrics ( CJEBP ) charge data monitor clinical trial . During trial , CJEBP investigate 8 research center quality practice least , without announcement . The monitoring object include doctor , nurse guardian object enrol trial . 2.2.1 Monitoring doctor : quality explain research object ' guardian whether sign paper notice ; Random distribution ; accurate measurement body length , weight head-circumference ; judgement gut intolerance ; record stool frequency ; picture stool eye secretion . 2.2.2 Monitoring nurse : accurate measuring equipment ; correctness measure method ; rightness data recording ( mean 2 measurement ) ; management trial formula ( reception time , check lot number , distribution object , date signature , recovery object , date , quantity formula signature ) 2.2.3 Investigator 's responsibility : random inspection 1-2 hospital , include whether mixed feed mixed brand formula ; usage trial formula ; regularly follow-up ; take photo fresh stool eye secretion . 2.3 Data management 2.3.1 According project CRF，administrator establish WeChat client , test modify client , entry data ensure accuracy client . Each researcher hospital uploads measure data administrator WeChat client day complete one case observation measurement . In order ensure accuracy data . Administrator compare data upload WeChat client original CRF .Subjects ' guardian upload photos stool character Eye secretion administrator WeChat client 3 point follow-up time . 2.3.2 Generation correction doubt , quality control ( QC ) database shutdown : After complete data input proofreading , data manager verify reliability , integrity accuracy data accordance requirement clinical trial scheme . If find lack content logic contradiction fill wrong uncertainty data , clinical arbitrator send clinical trial center In form data question table ( DQF ) .Researchers answer question soon possible return . Data administrator modify , confirm correct data accord researcher 's answer . After solve problem , Quality control person check quality database accord QC plan . Then close database check clear . 2.3.3 Data check lock transmit blindly : Data administrator submit data management report , request meet instance data-check blindly attend principal investigator , statistical analyst , data manager , arbitrator , sponsor . Checking data blindly , sign blindly data-check resolution meeting , lock database ; lock data analyze person statistical analysis . 3 . Statistic analysis 3.1 Analysis set 3.1.1 Full Analysis Set ( FAS ) : It Includes randomly group take experimental formula least one follow-up record least . The lack primary outcome endpoint evaluate last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) . FAS : Crowd use analysis primary secondary efficacy indicator . 3.1.2 Per Protocol Set ( PPS ) : It include case conform trial plan , good compliance , use formula period trial , completeness CRF content . The missing case treatment time reach certain time period trial enter PPS data set . Missing data transfer bad observation carry forward ( WOCF ) .After completion trial , data set determine blindly . Crowd use analysis primary secondary efficacy indicator . 3.2 statistical analysis plan 3.2.1 General principle : All statistical test must two-sided test .P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant difference test . Mean , median , standard deviation , maximum , minimum , 25 % 75 % quintile use statistical description measurement data . Count data level data describe frequency . SAS 9.1.3 statistical software use statistical analysis . 3.2.2 Analysis miss case list case group , fall complete . Analysis set case number , loss rate comparison group analyze chi square test Fisher 's exact probability method . 3.2.3 Effectiveness evaluation : Normal distribution test measurement index ( growth rate height , body weight head circumference , stool frequency end 4 , 8 12 week feed ) . If data accord normal distribution , difference experimental group control group calculate test , otherwise ' test . If data conform normal distribution , Wilcoxon rank sum test use . Test level =0.05 ( bilateral ) . The count data ( constipation Eye secretion end 4 , 8 12 week feed ) express number case percentage . If percentage 5 % number case less 30 , Fisher exact probability method use , otherwise chi square test use . Test level =0.05 ( bilateral ) . 4 . Quality control Standardized operation procedure establish research process . 4.1 Qualification research institution : Research institution must community health service center qualify baby healthy check-up . 4.2 Qualification researcher : The researcher need GCP training work guidance senior professional . 4.3 Test quality control measure : ①Before start clinical trial , researcher ( include paramedic ) must receive training measurement height , weight head circumference ; ②checking measurement bed measurement ; ③researcher must compare scale plastic flexible rule standard steel rule change plastic flexible error &gt; 0.1cm.③The picture feces eye score 2 specialist condition unknowing group . ④The specialist must responsible experimental formula , counter lock , storage room temperature away light . The remain experimental formula store separately , register number . At end trial , remain experimental formula send back sponsor.⑤Monitor : Monitor appoint sponsor , ensure subject ' interest period trial . Trial record data report must true , accurate , complete correct , ensure trial must comply approved plan Relevant law .</detailed_description>
