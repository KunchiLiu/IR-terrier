	<detailed_description>Overall Study Objective The Bright Light Therapy Efficacy Depressive Symptoms Following Cardiac Surgery Acute Coronary Syndrome : Pilot Trial ( BEAM-P ) randomize control trial ( RCT ) seek assess feasibility conduct full trial would assess efficacy Bright Light Therapy ( BLT ) improve depressive symptom post-cardiac surgery acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Specific Objectives To assess feasibility conduct full trial , include assessment recruitment rate , retention rate , adherence , process time , potential additional data value measure . Rationale More 50,000 Canadians undergo coronary artery bypass grafting ( common cardiac surgery ) year 100,000 hospitalize ACS . Of patient , least 15-20 % experience depression . Depressed cardiac patient nearly 20 % increase risk all-cause mortality , increase risk cardiac death , increase risk experience future cardiovascular event . Addressing depression depressive symptom cardiac surgery ACS patient therefore crucial . BLT could represent simple , safe , cost-effective method reduce depressive symptom follow cardiac surgery ACS . BLT show decrease depressive symptom individual seasonal affective disorder non-seasonal depression general population , well specific patient population . However , efficacy BLT reduce depressive symptom post-cardiac surgery ACS unknown . The full BEAM Trial first study effect BLT patient population . Since BLT yet investigate cardiac patient , feasibility conduct large trial BLT population must determine order avoid potential pitfall enhance chance success full trial . Methods We conduct RCT treatment period 4 week 12 week follow-up post-cardiac surgery ACS . A total 38 cardiac surgery ACS participant randomize 1:1 one two treatment arm : 1 ) BLT ( 10,000 lux light intensity ) 2 ) Dim light ( control group ; 500 lux light intensity ) . Study personnel participant blind treatment allocation . Permutated block randomization help ensure balance know unknown confounders . Informed consent obtain person individual . Participants group begin use lamps in-hospital continue treatment home remainder 4 week post-surgery ACS . At baseline day discharge , participant complete Patient Health Questionnaire 9 ( PHQ-9 ) , Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short version ( DASS-21 ) , Short Form ( 36 ) Health Survey ( SF-36 ) questionnaires order determine index level depressive symptomology ( PHQ-9 , DASS-21 ) health-related quality life ( SF-36 ) . A case report form , collect demographic clinical information , also complete baseline day discharge . There clinic visit week 4 , patient return lamp complete questionnaire , study personnel complete case report form monitor treatment adherence . At week 12 , participant option complete questionnaire online mail . To compensate participant expense incur due participation ( parking , childcare , opportunity cost , etc . ) , receive $ 25 week 4 , $ 20 prepay VISA card complete questionnaire week 12 . Significance BLT may simple , cost-effective , safe method decrease severity depression depressive symptom patient follow cardiac surgery ACS . Even small reduction depressive symptom could significant effect occurrence cardiovascular event , cardiac death , all-cause mortality high-risk population . The full BEAM Trial provide regulator , health care professional , patient important new information efficacy BLT decrease symptom depression population . Conducting BEAM-P study help ensure success carry full BEAM Trial .</detailed_description>
