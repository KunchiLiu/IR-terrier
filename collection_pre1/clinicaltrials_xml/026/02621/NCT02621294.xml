	<brief_summary>Our objective determine dietary requirement protein strength endurance exercise train ( 4 month train experience ) individual 18 - 30 year age use indicator amino acid oxidation ( IAO ) method . This study first determine require quantity protein need per day strength- endurance train young adult use IAO method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Protein Requirement Using Amino Acid Oxidation Strength Endurance Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The adequacy protein dietary requirement strength ( ST ) endurance ( ET ) exercise train individual subject considerable debate many year , present , discrepancy establish dietary protein requirement healthy adult issue guideline athlete . Despite past nitrogen balance study suggest great protein requirement ST ET athlete , Institute Medicine ( 2005 ) recommend `` additional dietary protein healthy adult undertake resistance endurance exercise '' . Current protein amino acid ( AA ) requirement estimate adult base nitrogen balance data consider flaw due several methodological problem include use single linear regression analyze nonlinear data over/underestimation nitrogen intake excretion , respectively . To overcome problem , indicator amino acid oxidation technique ( IAO ) develop determination dietary AA protein requirement . The IAO method base concept dietary protein inadequate , AA , include indicator AA , oxidize . With increase total protein intake , oxidation indicator AA decrease . Once requirement met , change oxidation indicator AA inflection 'breakpoint ' estimate requirement . A mixed-effects change-point regression analysis F13CO2 ( label tracer oxidation 13CO2 breath ) response grade amount protein utilized come limitation linear regression previously use nitrogen balance . These protein requirement measure use IAO carry ST ET individual previously first study . The result study help determine optimal protein requirement ST ET athletes important athlete also older individual whose loss muscle mass link variety health concern .</detailed_description>
