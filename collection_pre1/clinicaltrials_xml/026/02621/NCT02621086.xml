	<brief_summary>This initial pilot study assess investigate adverse symptom occur ( also severity symptom ) consume food-grade Cellodextrin preparation . Volunteers attend short ( around 30mins ) medical screen visit , make sure suitable take part study . They attend 4 study visit ( separate least week ) around 9.5 hour time . During study visit 10 , 20 , 30 , 50g Cellodextrin give single oral dose , milkshake drink , symptom experience monitored via questionnaire study day next 60 hr , dietary intake also measure time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cellodextrins small-chain , non-absorbable , oligosaccharide produce incomplete hydrolysis insoluble cellulose . Like oligosaccharide escape digestion small intestine human gut lack enzymes required hydrolyse β-links form among unit monosaccharide . However , Bifidobacterium caeco-colon posse enzymes β-fructosidase β-galactosidase need breakdown carbohydrate chain constituent sugar , serf bacteria provide energy proliferation also produce gas ( Hydrogen , Carbon dioxide , Methane , metabolically useless host ) , short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) . This breakdown supply available energy estimate 1.5-2kcal/g , comparison digestible carbohydrate produce 4kcal/g available energy . The prevalence overweight obesity increase issue develop world reduction energy intake remain heart main treatment obesity . Due interest identify food ingredient combat dietary overconsumption . By replace digestible carbohydrate non-digestible oligosaccharide could possible reduce caloric load food approximately 2kcal/g carbohydrate , still keep taste 'mouth-feel ' reduce calorie product . Further benefit use non-digestible oligosaccharide dietary overconsumption include contribution compound could reduce appetite voluntary food intake , could improve energy intake regulation . Oligosaccharides may increase satiety bulking , slow gastric emptying , increase production Peptide-yy ( PYY ) Glucagon like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) . The latter demonstrate in-vitro , butyrate , one SCFA 's produced oligosaccharide break-down , increased PYY Proglucagon production rat epithelial cell . Little work do potential oligosaccharide effect appetite . assessment appetite effect energy regulation potential Cellodextrin human even limit . However , study investigate carry , important ass gastro-intestinal disturbance may occur dos would require . The recommendation total fibre intake 18g/day United Kingdom ( UK ) although actual UK average intake low , average 13-15g/day . It known average daily oligosaccharide intake UK , whether oligosaccharide include total fibre estimate . However , digest within small intestine , laxative effect , increase ease and/or frequency laxation excess intake may cause diarrhoea gastrointestinal symptom flatulence , bloat abdominal discomfort . Intolerance symptom due osmotic effect and/or fermentation ; osmotic effect may cause abdominal pain eventually diarrhoea capacity colon absorb water exceed . Moreover , fermentation produce gas may also induce abdominal pain , bloat excessive flatus . The tolerance non-digestible oligosaccharide usually good , although tolerance threshold depend type oligosaccharide , time consumption ( e.g . fast meal ) also individual factor absorption capacity , motility pattern , colonic response intestinal sensitivity . Polydextrose find tolerated dos 50g/day , resistant starch similar tolerability acceptable dose 45g/day , whereas galacto-oligosaccharide consumption 20g/day fructo-oligosaccharide consumption 40g/day report cause diarrhoea . The aim investigate initially whether Cellodextrin induce gastrointestinal symptom UK cohort healthy men woman extent . This information use inform future volunteer relative risk develop gastrointestinal problem severity symptom experience . A descriptive pilot study carry . Twelve healthy individual ( 6 male 6 female , 18-40y , BMI 18 30kg/m2 ) recruit . Interested individual contact investigator send copy information sheet attend medical screening . At medical screen full explanation study give informed consent gain . A medical screening questionnaire administer , blood pressure measurement make 10ml blood sample take via venepuncture suitably qualified staff . If suitable , participant attend laboratory 4 visit . They arrive laboratory around 8am , fast midnight night , complete series appetite gastro-intestinal symptom questionnaire . The participant consume 10 , 20 , 30 50g Cellodextrin milkshake drink . They repeat questionnaire every 30 minute 120 minute . A standard snack give stimulate gut motility questionnaire ( ) complete 150 180 minute . A low fibre sandwich lunch provide 240mins , follow 2 hour , questionnaire administer every 30 minute 420 480mins . Participants give diet symptom diary complete rest day follow 48hrs study visit . Feedback form administer participant withdraws completes study .</detailed_description>
