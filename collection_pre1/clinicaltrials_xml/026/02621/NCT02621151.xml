	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab ( MK3475 ) , Gemcitabine , Concurrent Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Cancer Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize addition immune checkpoint inhibition pembrolizumab , anti-PD-1 inhibitor , chemo-radiation therapy bladder may work increase eradication local tumor well distant micrometastases heighten immune surveillance . Due lack previous phase I trial establish safety combination ( pembrolizumab , gemcitabine , radiation therapy ( RT ) ) , initial safety lead-in cohort 3 6 patient enrol assess dose-limiting toxicity . Similar Phase I 3+3 design , one patient cohort experience dose-limiting toxicity , trial continue Phase II part enroll additional 48 patient efficacy evaluation .</detailed_description>
