	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis rTMS apply dorsolateral prefrontal cortex lead improve memory , language executive function compare patient receive sham , control treatment . The improvement define high performance California Verbal Learning Test ( CVLT-II ) . Secondary Hypotheses : - 1 : rTMS- lead high performance secondary cognitive measure relate executive function name compare performance participant sham treatment group termination treatment ; - 2 : rTMS-induced memory improvement parallel change serum cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) level treatment .</detailed_description>
