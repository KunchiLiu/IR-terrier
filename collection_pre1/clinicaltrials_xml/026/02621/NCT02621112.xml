	<brief_summary>Hepatitis B virus infection remain important clinical issue among patient renal replacement therapy . Seroconversion rate define anti-HBs Ab titer &gt; 10 IU/L intramuscular hepatitis B vaccination ( HBVv ) remain poor cohort . Factors associated inadequate anti-HBs response include old age , diabetes mellitus , obesity low hepatitis B vaccine dose . Various small-scale study include multiple high dose intramuscular vaccination multiple small dose intradermal vaccination attempt variable response . Recent study dose spar seasonal influenza vaccine deliver via novel intradermal microneedle demonstrate good immunogenic response similar full-dose intramuscular vaccination . Imiquimod , synthetic TLR7 agonist useful treatment DNA virus infection , show improve vaccine immunogenicity . The investigator therefore propose prospective , randomize study compare safety immunogenicity intradermal hepatitis B vaccination novel device intramuscular patient renal replacement therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HBV Vaccine Renal Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator aim recruit least 120 subject renal replacement therapy prospective double blind randomize control trial . All recruited subject HBsAg anti-HBs negative recruitment . Subjects randomly assign three group . All patient receive 4 dos hepatitis B vaccine 0,1,3 6 month : Group 1 : receive intradermal 10mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine two separate site ( 5mcg ) topical imiquimod ointment pretreatment 5 minute injection . Group 2 : receive intradermal 10mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine two separate site ( 5mcg ) topical placebo aqueous cream pretreatment 5 minute injection . Group 3 : receive intramuscular 10mcg ( 1mL ) recombinant hepatitis B vaccine two separate site ( 5mcg ) topical placebo aqueous cream pretreatment 5 minute injection . Subjects advise wash topical treatment 8 hour vaccination . Patients investigator blind type topical treatment apply . Anti-HBs titre measure baseline , vaccination , 12 18 month first dose vaccination . The primary end point seroprotection rate HBVv 12 month first dose vaccination . The secondary end point seroprotection rate HBVv geometric mean titre ( GMT ) fold increase anti-HBs 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 ( GMT ) 18 month first dose vaccination . Adverse reaction vaccine also assess immediately 1 month vaccination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients recruit aged ≥ 21 year , history chronic renal failure renal replacement therapy ( continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis hemodialysis ) . All patient give write informed consent 1 week period decide . Subjects must available complete study comply study procedure . Patients willing allow serum sample store beyond study period , potential additional future test good characterize immune response . All recruited subject HBsAg , antiHBs antiHIV negative recruitment . Inability comprehend follow require study procedure History illness might interfere result study pose additional risk subject due participation study . Have recent history ( document , confirm suspect ) flulike disease within week vaccination . Have know allergy component Study Vaccines . Have positive urine serum pregnancy test within 24 hour prior vaccination , woman breastfeed . Have active neoplastic disease history hematologic malignancy . Have know chronic active hepatitis B hepatitis C ( HBsAg+ve antiHCV+ve ) . Have know active human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Received experimental agent ( vaccine , drug , biologic , device , blood product , medication ) within 1 month prior vaccination study expect receive experimental agent study . Unwilling refuse participation another clinical study end study . Axillary temperature ≥ 38°C oral temperature ≥ 38.5°C within 3 day intend study vaccination .
