	<brief_title>Investigating Structural Functional Changes Retina Following PRP Diabetic Retinopathy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy common cause adult-acquired retinal vascular disease . Diabetic retinopathy estimate affect 100 million adult , lead cause blindness worldwide . Over past 30 year , epidemiological study clinical trial show early detection annual eye exam , intensive glucose blood pressure control , timely laser photocoagulation could prevent visual loss . More recently , variety new ocular treatment medication introduce , use PASCAL photocoagulation laser system , various anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy . While treatment revolutionize diabetic retinopathy patient manage clinically , question appropriate patient selection long-term efficacy safety treatment remain answered . The purpose study focus study nature time course 2 year structural functional change retina follow PASCAL photocoagulation severe preproliferative proliferative diabetic retinopathy patient .</detailed_description>
