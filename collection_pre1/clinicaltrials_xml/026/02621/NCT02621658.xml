	<brief_title>Clear Liquid v Liberalized Diet Preparation Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate Full Liquid Diet inferior Clear Liquid Diet preparation Screening Colonoscopy . Based data present , investigator hypothesize Full Liquid Diet well tolerate participant adversely affect colonoscopy outcome term bowel cleanse ( BC ) , adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) , time cecal intubation ( TCI ) . The result study may help guide dietary intervention preparation Colonoscopy Department Defense ( DOD ) Military Treatment Facilities . The relationship adequate colon cleanse adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) already establish . Almost 25 % patient , however , poor bowel preparation time Colonoscopy ( 1 ) . After review 5832 colonoscopy , Froehlich , et al. , find poor bowel preparation associate longer colonoscopy time , difficult procedure higher rate incomplete procedure ( 2 ) . Among cause , bowel cleansing affect purgative selection time administration , compliance recommend pre-procedural diet compliance purgative administration . Recently , find classically recommended clear liquid diet ( CLD ) indispensable adequate bowel prep . Stolpman , et . al , find low-residue diet non-inferior clear liquid diet ( CLD ) , group 201 patient ( 3 ) . Similarly , Melicharkova , et al , find bowel cleanse efficacy low-residue breakfast , day colonoscopy , comparable clear liquid diet ( CLD ) sample 213 patient administer low volume purgative preparation colonoscopy ( 4 ) . They also find statistically significant difference level patient 's acceptance low-residue diet . A group South Korea , lead Dr. Jung Yoon , find similar rate bowel cleanse patient undergo afternoon colonoscopy , offer Regular Diet ( 5 ) . A study , small study population , present abstract American College Gastroenterology Conference 2011 , report comparable bowel cleansing , polyp detection rate , colonoscopy time patient allow full liquid diet procedure ( 6 ) . Taken together , study show clear liquid diet may necessary order obtain good bowel cleanse preparation colonoscopy perform outpatient setting . A clear liquid diet still recommend diet , however , procedure . Given diverse population serve Military Treatments Facilities across United States , abroad , investigator aim investigate diet liberalization Full Liquid Diet ( FLD ) associate similar bowel cleansing compare Clear Liquid Diet ( CLD ) . In addition , investigator compare performance diet regard adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) , time cecal intubation ( TCI ) , withdrawal time , patient satisfaction . This study conduct prospective , randomized trial . The investigator endoscopists blind patient 's diet group . Patients 50 y/o , old , undergo screen colonoscopy offer participation study . If write , informed consent obtain , participant randomize ( A ) Control Group ( B ) Study Group ( 1:1 fashion ) . Study randomization perform use serially number envelope contain instruction CLD FLD . The control group allow Clear Liquid Diet day colonoscopy Study Group allow Full Liquid Diet day colonoscopy . These envelope prepare duplicate . One envelope provide participant one envelope maintain , seal , study group . Study participant complete Bowel Preparation consist bisacodyl 10mg per mouth x1 ( noon , day colonoscopy ) 4L Polyethylene Glycol solution ( split dose ) . Subjects drink 2 L Polyethylene Glycol 17:00 day colonoscopy 2 L 04:00 , morning prior colonoscopy . They follow one diet describe , base randomization , present BAMC Gastroenterology Clinic Colonoscopy . Before procedure , subject administer questionnaire order ass compliance , tolerability satisfaction diet . Research team Endoscopists also blind questionnaire data collection process finish . Colonoscopy perform usual fashion . Endoscopists assess level subject 's colon cleansing mean Boston Bowel Preparation Scale ( 7 ) . Time Cecal Intubation Colonoscope Withdrawal Time document , currently do BAMC Gastroenterology Clinic . Adenoma Detection Rates ( number screen patient least one adenoma divide total number patient screen colonoscopy ) calculate . Investigators compare Bowel Prep Quality/Colon Cleansing , Time Cecal Intubation , ADR , Patient 's Compliance Satisfaction bowel preparation two group . Primarily , investigator want ass whether Bowel Prep Quality/Colon Cleansing ADR experimental group non-inferior Bowel Prep Quality ADR control group . In addition , investigator asses whether participant 's Compliance Satisfaction similar superior experimental group vs control group .</detailed_description>
