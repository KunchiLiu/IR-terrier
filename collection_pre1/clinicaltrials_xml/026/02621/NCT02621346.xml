	<detailed_description>It well establish imagery improves motor performance learning . Imagery define `` experience mimic real experience , involve use combination different sensory modality absence actual perception : ( Cumming &amp; Ramsey , 2009 , p.5 ) . The mechanism think enhance effectiveness imagery theory functional equivalence ( Holmes &amp; Collins , 2001 ) . This theory propose person image , activate similar area brain , also become active individual actually engage task . The PETTLEP model ( Holmes &amp; Collins , 2001 ) framework application theory functional equivalence . It propose incorporate PETTLEP element Imagery experience increase similar area brain activation enhance imagery 's effectiveness . The element PETTLEP model follow : 1 ) physical refers recreate physical component skill ; 2 ) environment , refers recreate place skill perform ; 3 ) task , refers specificity content imagery skill image 4 ) Timing refers speed imagery complete . Real time effective ; 5 ) Learning , refers adapt imagery response learning ; 6 ) Emotion refers inclusion relate emotion imagery lead real-life situation enhance effectiveness imagery ; 7 ) perspective refers viewpoint imagery do ( Holmes &amp; Collins , 2001 ) . With respect perspective three type view image involve . The first internal perspective , refers create image individual would see look eye . Second external perspective , refers image outside , watch video . Lastly , kinaesthetic perspective , refers image movement feel . Research show increase muscle strength size internal imagery perspective effective external ( Leban et al. , 2010 ; Yoa et al. , 2013 ) . Additionally , internal imagery increase physiological response , hear rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate compare external imagery ( Ranganthen et al. , 2004 ) . Research examine effect motor imagery increase strength find imagery effective . Significant increase muscle strength occur range 10-22 % strength increase result imagery ( Clark et al. , 2014 ; Leban et al. , 2013 ; Yao et al. , 2013 ) . Additionally , research find effect trend significant muscle size ( Leban , 2013 ) . Leban colleague ( 2013 ) train participant total 12 day , saw increase muscle size . Physiological research suggest development muscle mass size require 4-8 week ( American College Sports Medicine , 2012 ) . As , give trend significance find exercise plus imagery group size thigh muscle short 12-day training protocol difference size exercise group , suggest imagery may affect muscle hypertrophy . Additionally , research look use imagery maintain muscle strength immobilization . For instance , immobilization index finger , mental imagery group maintain strength despite muscle atrophy ( Yao et al. , 1996 ) . Given finding possible follow muscle hypertrophy strength gain exercise , imagery may help attenuate loss muscle strength size maintenance phase . This may importance implication rehabilitation setting , well influence sedentarianism approach . For untrained sedentary individual , use mental imagery far easy exercise . If imagery attenuates loss strength muscle size may help individual able exercise maintain muscle strength require functional daily activity . Therefore purpose study assess mental imagery attenuate muscle size strength four week eight-week training program design increase muscle hypertrophy strength . It hypothesize imagery group maintain size strength gain similar rate maintenance exercise group , whereas control group expect lose muscle gain . The study consist two phase . Phase 1 exercise phase . Phase 2 maintenance phase . The study single blind randomized control trial . PHASE 1 : Consenting participant complete Par Q health screening , Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire ( GLTEQ ; Godin &amp; Sheppard , 1985 ) demographic questionnaire . Following , participant give DEXA body scan assess muscle mass predict 1rep maximum ( 1RM ) strength test leg press . The predicted 1 RM submaximal strength test use estimate maximum amount weight individual move . Participants come lab 3 time per week follow 5 minute walk warm 40-60 % predicted heart rate reserve , complete 2 warm leg press set follow 3 work set 8-12 rep 1 minute rest set . Following participant complete 3-5 minute cool . Each session last approximately 20 minute . Participants start 70 % predict 1RM increase progressively . A 10 % increase load apply individual perform current workload 1-2 rep require number third set . Participants complete 8weeks leg press exercise . After 8 week participant give DEXA scan predict 1 RM test . For participant show muscle growth leg muscle DEXA move onto phase 2 . PHASE 2 : participant move phase 2 randomize 1 3 group . This phase last 4 week . All three group continue come lab three time per week for20 minute per session . The maintenance group continue perform leg press 1/3rd final strength assessment . This percentage intensity recommend maintain muscle mass strength gain American College Sports Medicine . The imagery group , sit leg press image complete 3 set leg press . The imagery group ask fill Movement Imagery Questionnaire -revised give u measure imagery ability . The imagery group give imagery script prior image . Weekly manipulation check complete ensure participant imagine suppose . Control group come 3 time per week complete 3 set 8-12 bicep curl 1/3 predict 1 RM . Once per week imagery control participant hook EMG see muscle activation imagery . The EMG place surface skin quadriceps muscle . EMG duration 15 minute execute imagery leg press control group bicep curl exercise . The EMG measure microvolt . Measuring parameter involve connect participant sensor electrodes pick muscle tension response . This process non-invasive . Sensors place surface skin . Following 4 week participant give another DEXA scan predict 1 rep max . At end PHASE 2 participant complete final predict 1 RM strength assessment well DEXA scan measure muscle mass . Additionally , group give imagery manipulation check see control maintenance group image PHASE2 .</detailed_description>
