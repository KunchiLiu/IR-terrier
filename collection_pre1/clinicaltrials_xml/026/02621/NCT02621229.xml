	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) illness commonly diagnose adolescence low recovery rate high healthcare cost . The major medical complication AN malnutrition . Caloric restriction , purge weight control behavior lead medical instability ( abnormal vital sign ) require hospitalization . The primary goal hospitalization restore medical stability reintroduce nutrition , `` refeeding '' . Within 12 mo discharge , 43 % patient require medical rehospitalization . This result costly course recovery , give eat disorder expensive among primary mental health diagnosis require hospitalization . Several line inquiry seek identify characteristic short-term outcome may predict good recovery AN point rapid short-term weight gain strong predictor long-term outcome . Greater weight gain hospital predicts weight recovery 12 moand , psychotherapeutic trial , great weight gain first 3-4 wk ( 1.7-1.9 lb/wk ) predict full remission 12 mo . Unfortunately , currently recommend approach , Lower Calorie Refeeding ( LCR ) , associate slow weight gain prolong hospital stay . Treatment move sporadically toward Higher Calorie Refeeding ( HCR ) hope improve recovery . However , study date directly compare two approach . ] Since refeeding syndrome , characterize rapid electrolyte shift , delirium cardiac arrest response influx nutrient first describe around WWII , refeeding approach caution . Following documentation syndrome patient AN , conservative , consensus-based recommendation LCR develop ensure safety . LCR typically begin around 1200 kilocalorie ( kcal ) per day advance 200 kcal every day . The investigator find patient initially lose weight `` start low go slow '' approach require prolonged hospitalization achieve medical stability . This finding contribute recognition `` underfeeding syndrome '' . In subsequent study , investigator demonstrate HCR produce fast weight gain short hospitalization . While increase risk refeeding syndrome report use HCR , variety electrolyte supplementation protocol use manage risk examine . Findings observational retrospective study rapidly accept many clinician insurer HCR integrate practice many hospital . However , major gap evidence necessary adopt HCR new standard care . These gap : 1 . ) It known HCR impact clinical remission , typically define combination weight cognitive recovery 12 mo . 2 . ) The safety HCR confirm . The hallmark electrolyte imbalance refeeding syndrome occur frequently still systematically examine differ refeeding protocol . 3 . ) The relative cost-effectiveness two approach establish . The investigator propose conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) two site directly compare HCR LCR refeeding AN . To accomplish follow aim , 120 adolescent enrol upon admission hospital malnutrition secondary AN randomized 1:1 HCR ( begin 2000 kcal advance 200 kcal/d ) LCR ( begin 1400 kcal/d advance 200 kcal every day ) medical stability restore . Participants follow 12 mo randomization : Daily hospital follow-up [ 10 dy ] ,1 mo , 3 mo , 6 mo , 12 mo randomization .</detailed_description>
