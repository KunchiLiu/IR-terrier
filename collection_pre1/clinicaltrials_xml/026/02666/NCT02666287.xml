	<brief_summary>Batefenterol ( BAT ) novel bifunctional molecule combine muscarinic antagonism beta2-agonism single molecule development treatment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . FF corticosteroid approve inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) component combination product , vilanterol ( VI ) , long-acting beta2-agonist COPD . In current study FF investigate inhaled product combination BAT , treatment COPD . This study open-label , six-way crossover , single repeat dose study evaluate systemic pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability FF BAT administer via ELLIPTA™ alone , combination , concurrently 3 time clinical dose , follow single dose , propose clinical dose , follow repeat dos . This study consist screen period , 6 treatment period , follow-up visit . Each subject 3 period receive single dose treatment regimen ( 3 inhalation Day 1 single dose study period ) 3 period receive single dose treatment regimen follow 7-day , once-daily , repeat dose . On Day 1 period , subject receive single dose 3 inhalation . On Days 2-8 , subject receive 1 inhalation per day repeat dose regimen . There minimum 7-day washout treatment period . All subject receive 9 treatment follow-up procedure do 7 14 day last dose . Forty eight healthy subject enrol study , approximately 40 subject complete dose PK assessment . The total duration participation subject study 15 week . ELLIPTA register trademark GlaxoSmithKline [ GSK ] group company .</brief_summary>
