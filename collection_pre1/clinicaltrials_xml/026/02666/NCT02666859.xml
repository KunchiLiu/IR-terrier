	<brief_summary>The propose project develop effective prosthetic training rehabilitation regimen , use virtual reality , return patient high level independence function possible . The Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment ( CAREN ) system ( Motek Medical , Netherlands ) use immerse patient real life situation provide real time visual feedback motion improve training rehabilitation upper limb prosthetic user .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virtual Reality Prosthetic Training Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subject ask participate two 1-2 hour session test range motion ( ROM ) , activity daily live ( ADL ) return duty task ( RTD ) task without use virtual reality . All amputee subject require wear preferred prosthetic device session . The ROM task include , elbow flexion/extension , forearm pronation/supination , shoulder flexion/extension , shoulder abduction/adduction , shoulder rotation , torso flexion/extension , torso lateral flexion , torso rotation . The ADL task would include series task encompass typical active one would encounter daily basis , drink cup , bilateral unilateral lift task , reach grasp test . The RTD task would include series simple task service member typically perform daily work routine don doff jacket helmet , pack unpacking rucksack , carry weapon . The subject ask complete task three time . Prior perform task , participate virtual reality session , task demonstrate virtual screen animate model . The motion animate model determine previously collect data accurately predict correct motion individual . An avatar subject show screen display real time motion . The reflective marker strategically place subject connect correspond joint virtual avatar accurately animate real time motion subject virtual screen . The demonstrated model show simultaneously real time avatar show accuracy subject 's performance relation individualize predict optimized motion . This provide instant visual feedback subject .</detailed_description>
