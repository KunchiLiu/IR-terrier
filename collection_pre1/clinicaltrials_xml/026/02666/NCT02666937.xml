	<brief_title>Safe Limits Saturation ICU ( SLIM-study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Supplemental oxygen one commonly prescribed therapy intensive care unit ( ICU ) order avoid tissue hypoxia . Oxygen often administer superfluously . An increase number study suggest harmful effect supra-physiological PaO2 'hyperoxia ' . Therefore , important aim PaO2-values within physiological range . In ICU arterial oxygen concentration ( measure partial pressure oxygen ( PaO2 ) arterial blood gas analysis ) oxygen saturation measure pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) use target oxygenation . The partial pressure oxygen gold standard determine oxygenation status patient , SpO2-values continuously available . In order determine SpO2-targets safe avoid hyperoxia hypoxia ( determined PaO2 ) correlation PaO2 SpO2 critically ill patient investigated . Factors effect relationship define , peripheral blood flow skin temperature . PaO2 measurement routinely conduct multiple time day part regular care ICU . SpO2 measure continuously part regular care . When routinely schedule PaO2 value measure SpO2 write .</detailed_description>
