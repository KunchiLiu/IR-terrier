	<brief_summary>This study prospective , randomise , control multi-centre study examine outcome follow wide local excision ( WLE ) breast cancer ( treatment arm ) without ( control arm ) intra-operative use LightPath™ Imaging System . The intraoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) LightPath™ Images use inform surgeon detectable residual cancer , attempt achieve well guide cancer surgery complete tumour excision clear WLE resection margin . Study sit use local criterion consider standard care guide decision act positive margin . In LightPathTM arm resection margin status WLE specimen , cavity shaving ( ) metastatic status axillary ( sentinel ) lymph node measure LightPath™ Imaging System compare histopathology result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Female subject diagnosis invasive breast cancer ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) schedule wide local excision ( WLE ) +/- sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) screen , eligible randomise ( 1:1 ) either : 18F-FDG plus LightPath™ Image arm arm without 18F-FDG LightPath™ . Subjects arm standard care WLE . Extra cavity shave due positive 18F-FDG LightPath™ Images discretion surgeon . Subjects randomise 18F-FDG arm receive intravenous injection 5 MBq/kg , maximum 300 MegaBecquerel ( MBq ) 18F-FDG prior surgery . Subjects randomise arm receive standard care surgery . Randomisation conduct inclusion , screen visit . WLE perform per standard care arm study . Following resection , WLE specimen examine use LightPath™ Imaging System ( LightPath™ arm ) . If surgeon detect positive signal may perform cavity shaving resection cavity area correspond positive signal area ( maximum thickness 10mm ) . Axillary SLNB perform accord local practice . At site 99mTc use : In 18F-FDG + LightPath™ arm high dose 150 MBq technetium-99m ( 99mTc ) nanocolloid necessary avoid 18F-FDG mask signal 99mTc . In control arm standard dose 99mTc use . Blue dye use accord local practice site consider standard care . Sentinel lymph node ( SLNs ) examine use LightPath™ Imaging System ( LightPath™ arm ) . Where clinically indicate , ALND perform per standard care . At time protocol finalise LightPath™ data involve lymph node sufficient support recommendation available . For reason , LightPath™ Image result use direct ALND . All LightPath™ Images perform 60 180 minute post injection 18F-FDG . The WLE specimen , cavity shaving ( perform ) SLNs ( perform ) undergo standard care histopathological analysis . Lymph node also examine accord standard care histopathological analysis . The result histopathological analysis correlate LightPath™ Images . For case 18F-FDG arm , staff operating room recovery area care subject wear badge dosimeter . Staff handle surgical specimen theatre also wear ring dosimeter . In 18F-FDG arm histopathology analyse delay allow radioactive decay tissue sample suitably low level . At study site long-term follow-up standard care participant return study follow-up visit 1-6 week 3 , 6 12 month completion initially plan surgery . After participant follow annually 60 month initial surgery .</detailed_description>
