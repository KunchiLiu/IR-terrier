	<detailed_description>Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) lesion potentially metastatic life threaten . Hence , surgical excision standard treatment cutaneous SCC . However , patient ineligible surgery poor general health , concomitant anticoagulant immunosuppressive therapy , allergy local anesthetic . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) methylaminolevulinate ( MAL ) innovative treatment modality approve Europe treatment actinic keratosis , basal cell carcinoma , Bowen 's disease . However , currently , insufficient evidence support routine use topical PDT SCC . Ablative fractional laser ( AFL ) ablate epidermis dermis without significant thermal injury , create microscopic ablation zone portion skin laser apply . Our previous study show AFL-primed MAL-PDT ( AFL-PDT ) offer high efficacy conventional MAL-PDT treatment many disease , actinic keratosis , actinic cheilitis , Bowen 's disease . Investigators recruit Korean patient microinvasive SCC compare efficacy , recurrence rate , cosmetic outcomes AFL-PDT standard MAL-PDT .</detailed_description>
