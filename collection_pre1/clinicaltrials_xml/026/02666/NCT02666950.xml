	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 without cytarabine work treat patient acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome spread place body usually cure controlled treatment . WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether give WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 work well without cytarabine treat patient advance acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>WEE1 Inhibitor AZD1775 With Without Cytarabine Treating Patients With Advanced Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate clinical efficacy AZD1775 ( WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 ) combination AraC ( cytarabine ) patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) assess complete response ( complete remission [ CR ] plus CR incomplete blood count recovery [ CRi ] ) rate . II . To estimate clinical efficacy AZD1775 alone combination AraC patient relapsed/refractory AML hypomethylating agent failure myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) assess complete response ( CR plus CRi ) rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability AZD1775 alone combine AraC study population . II . To estimate additional measure clinical benefit ( i.e . hematological improvement , transfusion requirement ) . III . To measure duration response AZD1775 alone combine AraC . IV . To measure time response AZD1775 alone combine AraC . V. To measure time progression AZD1775 alone combine AraC . VI . To measure overall survival AZD1775 alone combine AraC . VII . To measure time AML ( MDS subject ) AZD1775 alone combine AraC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) AZD1775 alone combine AraC study population . II . To conduct correlative research study characterize underlie molecular event solidify putative mechanism action vivo identify potential pharmacodynamic/biomarkers response AZD1775 alone combine AraC . III . To evaluate quality life ( QOL ) patient-reported symptoms subject treat AZD1775 alone combine AraC . OUTLINE : Elderly newly diagnose patient assign arm A . ARM A ( ELDERLY NEWLY DIAGNOSED PATIENTS ) : Patients receive cytarabine subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-5 8-12 WEE inhibitor AZD1775 orally ( PO ) daily day 1-5 8-12 . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM B : Patients receive cytarabine WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 Arm A . ARM C : Patients receive WEE inhibitor AZD1775 PO daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
