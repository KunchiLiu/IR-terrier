	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate ability efficacy use polarization-enhanced reflectance fluorescence image device , PERFIS , ( see Device Brochure ) demarcation nonmelanoma skin cancer margin prior surgery . PERFIS harmless non-invasive device use image biological tissue vitro vivo . In study use image nonmelanoma skin cancer lesion prior surgery . The use PERFIS affect patient care treatment decision way . No extra tissue use imaging . Prior imaging , patient 's lesion prepare , cleanse per routine aseptic technique . Based visual inspection , major minor ax tumor mark exactly apparent tumor margin , ensure unbiased tumor excision . For mark , investigator use sterile blue mark pen visualized optical polarization image 440 nm . After mark , length major minor ax tumor measure use ruler . A photograph tumor ( ruler reference scale ) take . After measure photographing , polarize reflectance optical imaging use PERFIS device perform . Photographs PERFIS image device present Device Brochure . During imaging , tumor surround skin illuminate continuous wave low intensity monochromatic light non-coherent light source ( Xe-arc lamp combine interference filter ) wavelength 440 nm , power density skin approximately 0.4 mW/cm2 . This power density well standard safety threshold . No wavelengths power density utilize study . The light illuminator control shutter remains close except user-controlled image capture . Imaging initiate PERFIS device position surface patient 's skin . The shutter open close automatically facilitate image . This process ensure light transmitted surface skin , thus minimize risk potential accidental eye exposure . Imaging require minute entirely noninvasive . After image , local anesthesia administer , use 1 % lidocaine epinephrine deep dermal infiltration . The lesion prepare cleanse per routine aseptic technique . Surgical excision tumor perform use standard Mohs technique . A regular photograph wound bed ( ruler reference ) take . No extra tissue excise research imaging purpose . The excised tumor lesion undergo standard Mohs frozen histopathological preparation Hematoxylin Eosin ( H &amp; E ) stain . Dr. Neel analyze histological slide record presence location residual tumor cell . He utilize image generate PERFIS clinical decision making . After confirm excision margin free tumor cell histological evaluation , standard post-Mohs protocol perform . This first in-human trial PERFIS collagen image assist tumor detection . Therefore , investigator plan acquire set qualitative training image also subject quasi-quantitative analysis device yield potentially valuable information localize tumor . Forty patient ( i.e . 40 tumor ) image pre-operatively assess collagen irregularity distortion operative site . The Mohs surgeon mark boundary surgical site excision white light image pre-surgical marking capture . There two possible outcome histopathological analysis tumor sample follow first excisional stage Mohs surgery : either tumor margin `` clear , '' mean tumor present boundary surgeon 's pre-surgical marking , tumor margin `` positive , '' mean surgical margin still tumor present . Residual tumor localize topologically original tumor specimen remove additional stage Mohs excision . In first case `` clear '' tumor margin , surgeon 's pre-surgical estimate sufficient Mohs procedure complete . In situation , PERFIS image pre-surgical site overlain upon digital image surgeon 's primary marking determine collagen distortion present outside surgeon 's original marking . The presence collagen distortion beyond surgeon 's original marking would indicate failure PERFIS provide utility guide pre-surgical marking , since PERFIS would overestimate extent tumor spread margin . If collagen distortion lie within pre-surgical marking surgeon , would indicate PERFIS could useful guide pre-surgical marking . In second case `` positive '' tumor margin , PERFIS image overlain upon digital image pre-surgical marking surgeon . If PERFIS detect collagen distortion area tumor positivity surgeon 's pre-surgical marking would alter include inconspicuous tumor , hence reduce need additional excision histological analysis , PERFIS analysis grade successful . PERFIS would provide utility guide pre-surgical marking case . There may area PERFIS image show distortion `` normal '' margin area histologically-proven tumor . In case , PERFIS grade failure since extra , normal skin would sacrifice surgeon rely PERFIS image pre-surgical mark excision . At conclusion study , meaningfulness image result applicability clinical practice discuss , along limitation subjective evaluation . With image set 40 case investigator able present argument whether research technology promise would benefit surgeon delineate pre-surgical margin prior excision . A large , thorough quantitative analysis postpone next phase study development .</detailed_description>
