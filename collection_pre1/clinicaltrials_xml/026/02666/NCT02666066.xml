	<detailed_description>Human oncologic tissue exhibit strong phenotypic difference . Due advance acquisition analysis method medical image technology , extraction reliable informative image feature quantify difference currently possible . Radiomics , extraction large amount quantitative image feature convert medical image minable data , in-development field intend provide accurate risk stratification oncologic patient . Previous study Maastro demonstrate importance large number ( n=440 ) radiomics feature quantify tumor phenotype intensity , shape texture . A landmark study extraction image feature compute tomography ( CT ) data 943 patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) cancer six distinct datasets 1 . The model train lung cancer patient show large number radiomics feature also strong prognostic power head neck cancer patient . These data suggest radiomics signature decode general prognostic phenotype exist NSCLC HNSCC patient . The investigator anticipate result start point novel field apply advanced computational methodology medical image data , merge field medical image bioinformatics . Also , CT image apply routine clinical oncology practice decade almost every hospital worldwide , application analysis potential improve decision support large number cancer patient . Glioblastoma ( GBM ) common type primary brain tumor annual incidence approximately 500 patient Netherlands . Despite extensive treatment include resection , radiation therapy chemotherapy , median overall survival 14.6 month 7 . On CT magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) GBM usually appear heterogeneous tumor central area necrosis , surround thick irregular wall solid , living neoplastic tissue . The gross tumor often surround extensive edema usually exert considerable mass effect . So far several prognostic predictive factor identify include age , performance status , extent resection biomarkers MGMT , EGFRvIII IDH1 . However , value image biomarkers radiomics yet fully explore . Radiomics important role prediction prognosis patient GBM . As patient survive month , subset patient ( 10 % ) survive 5 year diagnosis . Identification patient may benefit treatment decision e.g . offer short-term survivor best-supportive care . The investigator hypothesize combination CT/MRI feature , molecular biology clinical data provide accurate prediction medical outcome . The long term objective build Decision Support System base predictive model establish study . An extensive dataset consist imaging , clinical , treatment data outcomes 360 patient treat Maastricht since 2004 retrospectively collect . This include 128 patient diagnosed biopsy , tumor situ planning CT . This dataset use build predictive model outcome ( survival 6- 12 month ) . This analysis complement radiomics study , analyze CT MRI radiomics feature . In order prove value signature validate external datasets .</detailed_description>
