	<brief_summary>Investigators recruit 20 healthy volunteer age 18 80 , history carpal tunnel syndrome wrist injury . Images capture twice , first 2D transducer 4D transducer compare image capture new 4D transducer , use movement data analysis protocol . Investigators also assess inter intrarater reliability 4D transducer image , use two different sonographers , train technique , measure blind image separate occasion , least two week apart . The overall goal project assess reliability , reproducibility , measurement normal subject use novel 4D ultrasonographic method characterize subsynovial connective tissue ( SSCT ) detect motion SSCT , median nerve tendon motion evaluation diagnosis patient disorder affect carpal tunnel , especially carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Comparability 2D 4D Ultrasound Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CTS diagnose many way , currently non-invasive method assess physiology within carpal tunnel , may help select treatment predict treatment outcomes . The investigator show preliminary work difference motion various structure within carpal tunnel , include median nerve , flexor tendon , SSCT , vary normal subject CTS . A clinical trial already way assess conventional ultrasound image predict outcome CTS treatment . In study investigator wish compare current ultrasound method , involve move two dimensional image , new technology capture move image three dimension ( i.e. , four dimension , 4D ) . If successful , single 4D measurement could replace longitudinal transverse 2D image , save time allow well understand relationship displacement plane .</detailed_description>
