	<brief_summary>Infants young child sub-Saharan Africa high rate iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) , adversely affect growth cognitive development . In-home iron fortification complementary food use micronutrient powder ( MNPs ) reduce risk IDA . However , area high burden infectious disease iron may increase risk unfavorable gut microbiota composition possibly influence diarrhea prevalence . Thus , urgent need find safe formulation iron fortification African infant . The investigator recently finish randomize , double blind control intervention trial Kenya investigator test whether addition galacto-oligosaccharides ( GOS ) MNP contain 5 mg iron protect adverse effect iron infant gut microbiome gut inflammation ( ClincalTrails.gov Identifier : NCT02118402 ) . Prebiotics also potential enhancer colonic iron absorption . Therefore , complement intervention study , present study compare iron absorption combination sodium iron EDTA ( NaFeEDTA ) ferrous fumarate ( FeFum ) without prior consumption GOS 3 week . The investigator enroll 80 Kenyan infant Kwale County , age 6-14 month 40 infant consume maize porridge blend MNP contain iron 40 infant receive porridge mixed MNP contain iron+GOS . After 3 week MNP consumption , two test meal feed two consecutive morning , consist maize porridge contain isotopically label FeFum NaFeEDTA isotopically label ferrous sulfate ( FeSO₄ ) , respectively . Fourteen day second test meal administration , whole blood sample collect venipuncture iron isotopic analysis . Iron inflammation status parameter determine baseline endpoint . A stool sample collect baseline first test meal day . The gut microbiome , fecal pH fecal SCFAs profile analyze . Knowing expect iron absorption iron GOS contain MNP inform decision type iron compound dose regimen MNPs allow low iron dose use still cover infant requirement absorb iron .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Iron absorption two iron-fortified maize-based test meal measure two group 40 infant ( total N=80 ) . Infants recruit Msambweni District Hospital community serve Msambweni District Hospital southern coastal Kenya . In group 1 , iron absorption measure 3 week MNP consumption contain 5 mg iron form NaFeEDTA ( 2.5 g ) FeFum ( 2.5 g ) GOS . In group 2 , iron absorption measure 3 week MNP consumption contain 5 mg iron form NaFeEDTA ( 2.5 g ) FeFum ( 2.5 g ) 7.5 g GOS . Iron absorption measure incorporation stable isotope erythrocytes least 14 day test meal administration . At baseline , blood sample collect potential study participant determination follow iron inflammation status parameter : hemoglobin ( Hb ) , plasma ferritin ( PF ) , soluble transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) , zinc protoporphyrin ( ZnPP ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , alpha-1-acid glycoprotein ( AGP ) . Anthropometrics ( height , weight , mid-upper arm head circumference ) measure , demographic , medical history feed habit assess use questionnaire . On day 1 , infant enrol randomize two group , start intervention . The infant consume 1 MNP sachet add maize porridge per day total 5 week . A stool sample collect day 1 determination gut microbiota composition , fecal pH fecal SCFAs . After 3 week MNP consumption , two isotopically labelled test meal feed infant caregiver supervision research team two consecutive morning 7 8 . Test meal A contain 2.5 mg 57Fe form FeFum 2.5 mg iron NaFeEDTA ( give 1.5 mg 56Fe 1 mg 58Fe ) . Test meal B contain 5 mg iron form FeSO₄ ( 3 mg 56Fe 2 mg 54Fe ) . The test meal consist maize porridge ( 5-10 % dry weight ) mineral water ( 30 ml ) randomly administer two consecutive day ( AB BA ) . Overnight , breast milk allow infant breast milk give least 3 h test meal administration . Infants allow eat drink 2 h test meal . On day first test meal , stool sample collect analyzed gut microbiota composition , fecal pH fecal SCFAs . Fourteen day second test meal administration , 3 ml whole blood collect venipuncture iron isotopic analysis iron inflammation status . Anthropometrics baseline questionnaire repeat . Compliance MNP consumption adverse event reporting ( morbidity monitoring ) do weekly visit infant .</detailed_description>
