In patient multiple risk factor nausea vomit , incidence 80 % . PONV significant negative effect patient satisfaction anesthesia one common cause unexpected hospital admission day-surgery . Sugammadex Neostigmine drug use reverse effect muscle relaxation produce drug commonly use surgery . Neostigmine drug common use purpose , PONV report usage .

	<brief_title>Sugammadex Versus Neostigmine Postoperative Nausea Vomiting After Laparoscopic Gynaecological Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 1500 laparoscopic abdominal gynaecological surgery perform Hospital every year hence need provide excellent analgesia minimize side effect medication improve patient satisfaction outcome . Postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) may occur 30 % woman undergo gynaecological surgery . In patient population multiple risk factor ( e.g . female gender , duration surgery &gt; 2 hour , non-smoker , history PONV history motion sickness ) , incidence 80 % . PONV significant negative effect patient satisfaction anesthesia one common cause unexpected hospital admission day-surgery . The primary aim study determine whether Sugammadex would reduce incidence self-reported PONV high-risk woman 6-hours undergoing laparoscopic gynaecological surgery , compare Neostigmine . The secondary aim investigate effect Sugammadex severity self-reported PONV 6-hour 24-hour ; quality recovery score 24-hours ; time first antiemetic dose pain intensity follow laparoscopic gynaecological surgery high-risk woman . This study intend double-blinded , randomised , single-center trial KK Women 's Children 's Hospital . Sugammadex selective relaxant-binding agent provide rapid reversal neuromuscular blockade induce general anaesthesia facilitate surgical procedure . The main advantage sugammadex action dependent inhibition acetylcholinesterase compare traditional reversal agent Neostigmine . Therefore , sugammadex associate cholinergic side effect like nausea , vomit bradycardia . This present study intend provide new , effective anaesthetic regimen produce reduction side effect surgery anaesthesia , high patient satisfaction . Sugammadex identify first selective relaxant-binding agent provide rapid reversal neuromuscular blockade induce general anaesthesia use facilitate surgical procedure ( Welliver 2006 ) . The mechanism Sugammadex differs commonly use reversal agent , neostigmine edrophonium , reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor . Neostigmine rely inhibition acetylcholinesterase , cause autonomic instability side effect like headache , blur vision , slow heart rate ( bradycardia ) , gastrointestial symptom include anorexia , nausea , vomit , abdominal cramp diarrhea . Hence , anticholinergic drug atropine administer concurrently prevent excessive muscarinic effect bradycardia ( Gilman 1980 ) . A previous study ( Lovstad et al 2001 ) show neostigmine increase incidence postoperative nausea vomit gynaecological surgery compare placebo . However , current practice provide neuromuscular blockade laparoscopic surgery , maintenance neuromuscular blockade require facilitate surgery , thereby make reversal agent necessary prevent postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade . Knowledge Gap : Without preventative treatment , 30 % patient undergoing general anaesthesia likely suffer postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) ( Cohen et al , 1994 ; Apfel et al , 1999 ) . In patient population multiple risk factor ( e.g . female gender , duration surgery &gt; 2 hour , non-smoker , history PONV history motion sickness ) , incidence 80 % . PONV significant negative effect patient satisfaction anaesthesia one common cause unexpected hospital admission day-surgery . Since Hospital 1500 laparoscopic gynaecological surgery perform every year , significant clinical problem . Unplanned hospital admission due postoperative nausea vomit low-risk , day-surgical , gynaecological procedure hospital account 29 case total 163 case last year ( 18 % ) . In fact , Ministry Health track unplanned hospital admission performance indicator . Sugammadex expensive compare neostigmine , therefore use limit high-risk PONV group , order maximize cost-benefit potential . Sugammadex first approve use European Union 2008 also approve Australia , Iceland , New Zealand Norway . A recently publish Cochrane systematic review Sugammadex ( Abrishami et al 2012 ) examine efficacy safety Sugammadex author conclude Sugammadex show effective placebo ( medication ) neostigmine reverse muscle relaxation cause neuromuscular blockade surgery relatively safe . Inadequate reversal neuromuscular blockade may lead breathe problem hypoxia due inability breathe adequately , potentially lead prolonged hospitalisation , thereby cause increase healthcare cost . Train-of-four ( TOF ) monitoring enables anaesthetist ass neuromuscular blockade could safely reverse . The expert recommendation reverse neuromuscular blockade TOF least 2 ( 0 4 , 0= dense neuromuscular blockade , 4= minimal neuromuscular blockade ) . Sugammadex may potentially lead great patient safety anaesthesia time offer great patient satisfaction term reduce side effect neostigmine like nausea vomiting . However , little evidence clinical outcome administration Sugammadex , incidence severity PONV surgery quality recovery pain intensity high-risk woman follow laparoscopic gynaecological surgery . Our current proposal compare Sugammadex neostigmine woman high-risk PONV laparoscopic gynaecological surgery . As study first clinical trial target population high-risk develop PONV may change routine clinical practice . If hypothesis true , Sugammadex provide new anaesthetic regime well patient safety efficacy reduction unplanned hospital admission ; reduction anaesthetic complication nausea , vomit inadequate reversal neuromuscular blockade routinely produce anaesthesia .</detailed_description>
