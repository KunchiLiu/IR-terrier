	<brief_title>A Single Dose-Escalation Study Evaluate Safety Pharmacokinetics Orally Administered DAA-I Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study single-blind , step-wise dose escalation , placebo control study healthy subject consist 3 dose step DAA-I . In sequential step wise design , single dose DAA-I placebo administer 6 subject one treatment group . For dose step , 4 subject receive DAA-I 2 subject receive placebo . Subjects randomly allocate one dose step . Step One would complete Step Two . Escalation Step Two subsequent step would depend safety result precede step ( ) . There interval 6 hour dose first second DAA-I-treated volunteer cohort allow early cardiovascular monitoring . Only safety signal identify subject assess Safety Review Committee simultaneous dose remain volunteer carry .</detailed_description>
