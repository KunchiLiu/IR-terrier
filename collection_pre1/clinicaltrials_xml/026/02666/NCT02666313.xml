	<brief_title>WEB-Based Physiotherapy People With Axial Spondyloarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Axial spondyloarthritis ( axial SpA ) inflammatory arthritis characterise inflammatory back pain include ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) non-radiographic axial SpA . Axial SpA associate pain stiffness spine and/or sacroiliac joint , reduce spinal mobility , fatigue , reduce physical activity , psychological consequence depression , reduce function , work productivity quality life . Effective management axial SpA require combination pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention . While significant advance pharmacological therapy , particularly introduction TNF-inhibitors , advance physiotherapy non-pharmacological therapy deliver . This despite physiotherapy recognise 'cornerstone ' overall management people AS , term manage symptom maintain function . Physiotherapy comprise education exercise programme aim improve maintain spinal mobility , reduce spinal pain , increase strength stabilise slow disability progression . Physiotherapy require long-term combination pharmacological therapy . A Cochrane Review 2008 conclude home supervise individual exercise beneficial people AS , group exercise beneficial home-based exercise . However , beneficial , exercise need do least five time per week , least 30 minute per session continue long-term basis . Patients axial SpA increasingly diagnose treat earlier , reduced disease activity result treatment TNF-inhibitors likely young employment traditionally case . For reason , patient find difficult attend maintain regular traditional physiotherapy session , particularly long-term . Practically , , exercise programme must include degree home-based exercise since level exercise deliver long-term basis NHS service . Despite requirement regular physiotherapy , recent NASS patient survey reveal 60 % patient physiotherapy previous 12 month period . There therefore need find alternative service model support facilitate people axial SpA exercise regularly long-term basis . The Office National Statistics report 86 % adult population ( age 16 year ) UK use internet 73 % ( 36 million adult ) use daily basis . In addition , increase number people use internet health care information resource . Thus almost ubiquitous availability use internet provide ideal opportunity deliver tailor , individualise , interactive exercise programme people long-term condition , include axial SpA . Web-based intervention available 24 hour day thus patient choose time location participate suit personal circumstance . Physiotherapy-led , personalised web-based exercise therefore offer potentially cost-effective mechanism deliver important long-term component axial SpA warrant evaluation . Two group base Netherlands examine web-based intervention increase physical activity patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Van Den Berg compare 12 month individually target , physical intervention deliver online 12 month general online advice education regard physical activity people RA . In addition , intervention group receive regular email physiotherapist also attend group meeting every 3 month . The study demonstrate intervention effective increase proportion participant achieve national physical activity recommendation compare general training group . There difference however function quality life author note website usage reduce time . The study Bossen et al ( 2013 ) investigate internet deliver physical activity programme patient hip and/or knee OA . The Join2move programme nine-week programme nine module complete participant . The result show increase physical activity time spend moderate intensity physical activity significantly wait list control . The study report high attrition rate attribute mainly fully automated nature intervention absence human contact support . Thus evidence use web-based intervention increase physical activity people RA OA however previous study investigate axial SpA regular physiotherapy deliver via internet . We develop website collaboration patient group Scottish Accessible Information Forum platform deliver individualised web-based physiotherapy ( demonstration page : www.webbasedphysio.com ( log : testphysiopatient @ gmail.com , password : password ) . We evaluate short term effectiveness approach ( maximum 12 week ) number patient group . Kelders et al . ( 2012 ) report user continue use web-based intervention desire way usage reduces effectiveness intervention . Since evidence base suggest people axial SpA exercise five day per week , important evaluate compliance/adherence web-based physiotherapy programme long period . Study Design Pilot cohort study Aim The aim prospective cohort study assess feasibility , sustainability acceptability 12 month individualise web-based physiotherapy programme people axial SpA . Research objectives - Over one year period often people axial SpA use web-based physiotherapy programme ? - What people axial SpA think web-based physiotherapy programme ? - What help people axial SpA use web-based physiotherapy programme long-term ? - What effect one year web-based physiotherapy pain , stiffness , physical function , physical activity , quality life employment ? - Which patient likely benefit web-based physiotherapy programme ? Research question Primary Research Questions â€¢ What four weekly compliance rate web-based physiotherapy programme one year period ? Secondary Research Questions - What view user web-based physiotherapy programme ? - Why people stop use web-based physiotherapy programme ? - Is association compliance patient outcomes ? - What associations baseline characteristic compliance and/or patient outcome ? - Which patient likely benefit intervention ? - Does 12 month web-based physiotherapy potential positively alter pain , disease activity , functional ability , exercise capacity , quality life , physical activity employment axial SpA ? Plan Investigation Fifty people confirm axial SpA , receive 12 month individualise , remotely monitor , web-based physiotherapy . They ask exercise programme five time per week . The main outcome compliance programme measure every four week . Secondary outcome ( baseline , 6 12 month ) function , disease activity , spinal mobility , quality life , exercise capacity , health status , employment , physical activity , attitude motivation toward exercise . Interactions health care professional medication usage document use weekly paper diary . A small sample 10 participant , mixture participant adhere programme ( maximum variation sample ) , interview 6 12 month gather view web-based physiotherapy programme factor affect compliance . Website development The website consist home page , exercise page , exercise diary advice/information section . Each exercise page within website consists video demonstrate exercise , text explain exercise , audio description exercise timer . The site contain catalogue exercise , four level difficulty , well warm cool . The website easily access via personal computer , tablet smart television customise use patient axial SpA . The programme incorporate number behavioural change technique know successful promote maintain exercise behaviour eg . goal set monitoring . We map behavioural change technique within current website Behaviour Change Techniques Taxonomy propose Michie et al . ( 2013 ) . Currently programme incorporate goal planning , feedback monitoring , shape knowledge , natural consequence , comparison behaviour , repetition substitution antecedent . The website continually revise functionality improve depend result study also result map exercise . The current exercise catalogue adapt expanded include AS-specific exercise base popular Back Action programme ( http : //nass.co.uk/back-to-action ) produce National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society ( NASS ) ( permission already grant NASS ) specifically developed patient axial SpA . The NASS Back Action programme currently available pdf/app , propose web-based physiotherapy programme differs ( ) individualise ( b ) base effective behavioural change technique ( discuss ) ( c ) interactive , regularly monitor alter remotely physiotherapist .
