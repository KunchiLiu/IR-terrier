NOTE : If tumor refractory ( progress ) prior chemotherapy regimen , regimen would count . If prior chemotherapy regimen change due reason disease progression ( e.g . poor tolerance , allergic reaction ) , would count separate prior regimen . A chemotherapy drug add `` maintenance '' follow disease stabilization response chemotherapy regimen ( absence prior disease progression ) count separate prior regimen . Chemotherapy part initial potentially curative therapy ( give part adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy ) complete &lt; 1 year count 1 prior regimen .
