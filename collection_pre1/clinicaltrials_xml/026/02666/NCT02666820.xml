	<brief_summary>Endoscopic sphincterotomy ( EST ) combine large balloon dilation ( LBD ) increasingly accept alternative method removal large bile duct stone . However , limited study compare efficacy EST combine LBD EST mechanical lithotripsy ( ML ) . The purpose study compare efficacy safety combine EST- LBD versus EST-ML removal large bile duct stone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Papillary Large Balloon Dilatation Versus Mechanical Lithotripsy Large Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The large common bile duct stone ( CBDS ) remain therapeutic challenge ERCPs . Large CBDS generally refractory remove EST stone extraction balloon basket . Traditional rescue therapy technique stone fragmentation use ML . The previous report show EST ML successful fragmentation large stone yield stone clearance rate 68 t0 79 % . EST-LBD show favorable outcome treatment large bile duct stone . A meta-analysis compare effectiveness complication EST-LBD EST management CBDS show EST-LBD effective EST removal large difficult CBDS term stone clearance first ERCP session 87.87 % vs. 84.15 % overall clearance 97.35 % vs. 96.35 % EST-LBD associate few complication well reduce need ML compare EST . The efficacy EST-ML versus EST-LBD therapy relatively large CBDS , mean stone size &gt; 20 mm currently well define . The investigator , herein , compare efficacy complication EST follow LBD ML removal CBDS &gt; 15 mm mean stone size &gt; 20 mm .</detailed_description>
