	<detailed_description>Phase II study test chemo-free induction therapy Ibrutinib + Obinutuzumab nine month follow MRD-driven strategy . Assessment response well bone marrow MRD evaluation perform Day 1 month 9 : 1 . Patients reach CR marrow MRD 10-4 threshold continue ibrutinib 6 additional month . 2 . Patients PR bone marrow MRD &gt; 10-4 receive Ibrutinib 6 additional month 4 course FC+ GA101 . At Day 1 Month 16 , patient CR MRD &gt; 10-4 continue Ibrutinib progressive disease . 3 . Patients stable progressive disease exclude trial . Final evaluation response ( BM MRD ) perform Day 1 Month 16 .</detailed_description>
