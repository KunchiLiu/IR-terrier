	<brief_title>Hypoglycaemia People With Type 2 Diabetes Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - previous study provide robust evidence link intensive therapy increase frequency hypoglycaemia people type 1 diabetes . Despite type 2 diabetes comprise majority case diabetes , overall frequency hypoglycaemia group carefully document type 1 diabetes , particularly relation clinical use individual therapy primary care . Recent prospective study suggest hypoglycaemia occur frequently previously think people type 2 diabetes , particularly treat insulin sulphonylureas . An increasingly elderly population , early initiation insulin new therapy treatment combination , may influence risk severity hypoglycaemic episode . The overall aim undertake research provide robust data frequency severity hypoglycaemia people type 2 diabetes manage primary care , assess explore associate risk factor . PROSPECTIVE STUDY Aims - prospectively evaluate self-reported frequency severity hypoglycaemia people type 2 diabetes manage primary care ( stratified participant treatment regime ) ; investigate associate clinical demographic predictor hypoglycaemia . Methods - undertake prospective , observational cohort study . Firstly , general practice approach participate study , aim recruit around 20 practice throughout UK . All recruit site receive relevant study training purpose recruit participant collecting/recording research data . Participating general practice identify potentially eligible individual practice register ; individual invite via study invitation pack send post give person attend practice . Individuals express interest invite attend appointment general practice inform consent obtain baseline data collect ( demographic , bio-medical self-completion questionnaire ) . Participants provide relevant study material ( glucose monitoring diary , hypoglycaemia recording form , blood glucose meter strip ) ask measure blood glucose record episodes hypoglycaemia , period 12-months . Repeat biomedical self-completion questionnaire data collect 12-months follow-up . The overall sample size prospective study 422 , base recruit quota participant follow treatment regimen : 1 ) metformin ( n=62 ) ; 2 ) sulphonylurea base ( n=140 ) ; 3 ) insulin base ( n=140 ) ; 4 ) incretin base ( Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP4 ) Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) ) , ( n=80 ) . Practices ask continue recruitment target meet treatment group . CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY Aim - provide data prevalence hypoglycaemia people type 2 diabetes manage primary care explore associate risk factor . Methods - approach participation make potential volunteer attend plan appointment diabetes care ( e.g . diabetes annual review , diabetic retinopathy screening ) , poster advertisement site . Their healthcare professional also explain researcher clinic recruiting individual type 2 diabetes take part research study . The researcher approach potential volunteer provide brief verbal explanation study , follow write participant information sheet read . Subsequently , individual volunteer participate , ask sign consent form give questionnaire self-complete ( appointment take home post back research team ) . In addition , researcher obtain biomedical data participant ' medical record ; data collect least 48 hour pass time inform consent obtain , allow time participant may change mind take part . The anticipated recruitment target cross-sectional study recruit 2000 participant .</detailed_description>
