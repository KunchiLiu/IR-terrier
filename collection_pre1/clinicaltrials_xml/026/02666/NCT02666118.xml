	<brief_summary>Nerve block , pain medication inject next nerve patient asleep , commonly use pain management shoulder surgery consider highly effective decrease post-operative pain . There several different way give nerve block . All effective safe . The purpose research determine one available way give nerve block effective others .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Nerve Blockade Performed Prior Surgical Intervention Versus Following Surgical Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interscalene brachial plexus blockade commonly perform provide relief postoperative pain follow surgical shoulder repair . This proven reliable mean reduce required dos intraoperative postoperative opiate effectively delay postoperative pain , well hasten patient discharge increase patient satisfaction . Neural blockade traditionally perform prior surgery hope preemptive analgesia effectively abate postoperative pain . Recently , however , argue sensitization pain attribute many factor , solely nociceptive battery associate incision subsequent intraoperative event . The duration action effectiveness treatment modality thus appear play important role actual timing treatment deliver . The safety efficacy perform interscalene brachial plexus blockade general anesthesia recently report safe , perhaps effective perform awake patient . We propose randomized prospective evaluation analgesic efficacy compare interscalene brachial plexus blockade perform prior surgery interscalene brachial plexus blockade perform follow completion surgery healthy ASA I II adolescent patient undergoing unilateral shoulder reconstruction outpatient basis .</detailed_description>
