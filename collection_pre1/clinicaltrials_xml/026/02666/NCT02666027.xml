	<brief_title>The Use Fluid IV Alert Monitor Decrease Incidence Undetected Empty IV Bag Dimmed Operating Rooms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale The first intravenous ( IV ) system develop Dr. Thomas Latta 1832 treat Cholera patient . Following introduction , IV delivery system widely adopt mean fluid resuscitation , rehydration administration blood product , medication vasopressor . Today , standard practice place IV catheter patient require operation hospital setting . Intravenous fluid administer IV tube vein carry drug need induction maintenance anesthesia . This IV fluid come several variety contain different amount electrolyte , glucose , acidity starch store variety volume sterile bag ( commonly 500 ml 1000 ml ) . Once connect IV catheter IV tubing , fluid bag hung IV pole patient flow patient gravity . In nursing ward , IV fluids routinely administer via infusion pump , deliver fluid specify rate volume would sound alarm select volume fluid complete . While effective mean administer IV fluid , time-consuming process set IV fluid pump program infusion volume rate . Perioperative fluid administration rapidly change process anesthesiologist would prefer control rate pre-programed pump . In operating room environment , rate manner drug fluid administration highly variable . Therefore , almost IV fluid administer system gravity-fed . In busy operating room , anesthesiologist carefully observe progress surgery anesthetic state patient different monitor . Intravenous fluid bag often run empty unnoticed IV fluid bag hang eye level anesthesiologist . Even vigilant anesthesiologist may able promptly detect dry IV fluid bag . In previous observational study , incidence undetected dry IV bag show 29.6 % . However , length time empty bag notice unknown . According recent survey work condition operate room , include 471 surgeon 405 nurse , report intra-operative hazard due insufficient illumination operate room especially dangerous situation , unexpected bleeding . In presence dim ambient light operate room , e.g . endoscopic surgery , probably difficult visually monitor flow IV fluid high incidence undetected dry IV bag . Several potential clinical adverse event occur dry IV bag detect promptly . Firstly , gravity-fed IV fluid use carrier administer drug , anesthetic total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) , infusion vasopressor , awareness anesthesia unstable hemodynamics may occur . Secondly , fluid volume resuscitation , IV fluid delivery system frequently pressurize order deliver fluid quickly possible unstable patient . The pressurized IV fluid bag force air present IV fluid bag IV tube fluid run . This potentially cause air embolism . Finally , undetected dry IV bag disrupt fluid flow catheter patient , allow blood pool around catheter . If clot form , occlude line prevent fluid flow . This may necessitate recannulation anesthetize patient surgery may technically challenge . The FIVAâ„¢ ( EngenuityMED , Halifax , Canada ) small , handheld , battery operate , device class I medical device Canada . It design alarm alert physician change IV bag fluid level chamber IV set low . It also function stop fluid flow gravity-fed tubing system alarm trigger , prevent air enter IV tube . We hypothesize FIVA would decrease incidence unnoticed dry IV bag surgery , particularly operate room light dim would therefore decrease risk associate undetected dry IV bag .</detailed_description>
