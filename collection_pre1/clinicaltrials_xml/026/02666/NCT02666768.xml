	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect ACTIMMUNE ( IFN-γ1b ) child adult intermediate osteoporosis . All participant receive treatment ACTIMMUNE 12 month . The investigator hypothesize ACTIMMUNE tolerate participant full 12 month result decreased disease severity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ACTIMMUNE Intermediate Osteopetrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteopetrosis rare inherit metabolic bone disease characterize impaired osteoclast function result defective bone resorption generalize high bone mass mineral density ( BMD ) . In patient severe disease , high bone mass compromise bone marrow space lead marrow failure frequent infection , along hepatosplenomegaly extramedullary hematopoiesis . Currently , treatment individual severe form osteopetrosis hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) , however survival patient osteopetrosis treat HCT around 55 % . Therefore , treatment indicate select individual life-threatening complication disease . Thus additional treatment osteopetrosis need individual candidate HCT prolong time HCT need . Interferon gamma ( IFN-γ ) naturally occur cytokine show anti-microbial anti-viral immunomodulatory effect , potent stimulator superoxide anion production turn promote formation activation osteoclast . Two previous study IFN-γ1b small group individual osteopetrosis find decrease trabecular bone area , increase marrow space , decrease number severe infection require antibiotic therapy , increase superoxide generation granulocyte-macrophage colony . Therefore , investigator conduct early phase 2 , multi-center , open-label , 12-month clinical trial ACTIMMUNE ( IFN-γ1b ) treatment patient intermediate osteopetrosis determine following : 1 . The feasibility tolerability interferon gamma-1b treatment 1 year patient intermediate osteopetrosis . Specifically , ) ability enroll patient , ii ) continue treatment throughout 1-year observational period . 2 . Change immunologic hematologic function , bone mineral density osteoclast function , physical function quality life .</detailed_description>
