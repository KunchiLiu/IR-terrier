	<brief_summary>Brachial plexus nerve block provide superior analgesia opioids avoid unwanted side effect . Single shot block local anesthetic alone usually last duration acute post-surgical pain period . This led exploration multiple adjuvant increase duration single shot block , promise adjuvant dexamethasone . Peri-neural administration off-label use dexamethasone . While adverse event report human clinical study , logic would dictate minimize dose need produce desired effect . Most study thus far used peri-neural dexamethasone dose range 4-10 mg . However , Albrecht et al . find difference block duration compare 4 mg 8 mg dos Liu et al . report equivalent block duration use dos 1 , 2 4 mg . Recent study evaluate whether systemic peri-neural administration dexamethasone equivalent , would turn imply site action . Results mixed . Four study conclude peri-neural intravenous administration equivalent prolong analgesia , though one study methodological error , include administration intravenous dexamethasone patient . All study use dexamethasone dose 8 10 mg. One study low dose ( 4 mg ) use find peri-neural administration prolong block duration whereas intravenous . With , rationale study determine equivalent block-prolonging analgesia achieve use low dose ( 1 mg ) dexamethasone give peri-neural intravenous . Clinical experience centre 1 mg dexamethasone add 20 mL produce similar block duration report publish study use high dos .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Dexamethasone Supraclavicular Blocks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator evaluate block-prolonging efficacy dexamethasone 1 mg supraclavicular block . The investigator answer essentially two question . First , long supraclavicular block last low dose dexamethasone use adjunct . Only one study look dos low ( Liu et al . 2015 ) . Some methodological problem study include evaluation shoulder surgery use supraclavicular block , may may cover posterior port site ; use endpoint `` time first analgesic '' , may may indicate actual block duration ; low number power 80 % , may yield spurious result . To avoid issue investigator choose upper limb surgery , type block definitely cover entire surgical site , endpoint time first pain surgical site , regardless whether analgesic need . The investigator also power 95 % recruit high number patient . The second question evaluate efficacy 1 mg intravenous dexamethasone . The study power address question , also power adequately address first question . Studies date mixed result methodological error . No study evaluate dose intravenous dexamethasone .</detailed_description>
