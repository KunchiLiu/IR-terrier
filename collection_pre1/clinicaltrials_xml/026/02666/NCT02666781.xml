	<brief_summary>Patients obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) likely experience postoperative complication impact significantly healthcare resource . In surgical population , type volume IV fluid administration may contribute worsen postoperative sleep apnea pathophysiological mechanism elucidate . Recent research general population suggest intravenous ( IV ) fluid administration worsen severity OSA shift fluid legs neck thus increase neck size cause airway collapse . In novel study , objective examine contribution IV fluid administration rostral fluid shift legs neck thereby lead worsen sleep apnea follow surgery . In prospective observational cohort study , 25 consecutive adult patient , require least 2 day hospital stay , recruit . Following informed consent , patient undergo portable home sleep study determine preoperative severity sleep-disordered breathing . On day surgery , leg , neck total body fluid volume record , patient undergo general anesthetic . The result study used design future clinical trial evaluate method decrease postoperative OSA worsening , well decrease OSA-related postoperative complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common sleep-related breathing disorder , associate increased morbidity mortality . It independent risk-factor post-operative cardio-respiratory complication increase perioperative utilization health care resource . In non-surgical patient , rostral fluid shift lower limbs neck identify pathophysiologic mechanism explain OSA severity base gender , increase age , fluid-overload state . In novel study , objective examine contribution fluid shift lower limbs neck thereby lead worsen sleep apnea follow surgery . Objectives study - Measure change leg , neck total fluid volume preoperative baseline second postoperative day . - Assess impact change neck fluid volume neck circumference postoperative AHI . Similar patient heart failure , renal failure old men , hypothesize rostral shift fluid lower limb neck occur postoperative period contribute postoperative worsening OSA . In study , perform serial measurement segmental total body water shift occur surgery , various time-points two postoperative day . We monitor index Apnea Hypopnea index ( AHI ) oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ) examine change severity OSA . Internal validity study make robust use well-validated method BIA fluid measurement portable PSG OSA severity .</detailed_description>

Patients undergoing cardiac , intracranial surgery , procedures involve neck cervical spine surgery , carotid endarterectomy . Patients require epidural spinal anesthesia surgery , neuraxial blockade may impact fluid shift leg neck may confound result .
