	<brief_summary>Every year &gt; 50.000 people Denmark hospitalize suspect acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . The majority explanation chest discomfort discharge without initiation treatment . Still , suspicion dictate acute ambulance deployment , hospital admission highly specialized cardiac unit , cardiac surveillance cardiac troponin blood sampling . The novel biomarker copeptin , byproduct vasopressin production , release immediately pituitary gland part hormonal response AMI . Peak concentration reach within first hour . Previous study suggest combination copeptin cardiac troponin fast reliable rule AMI . However , blood sampling perform soon possible symptom onset , preferably already prehospital phase . We aim , open randomize setting , investigate combine measurement prehospital copeptin in-hospital high sensitive cardiac Troponin T compare standard rule-out procedure suspect myocardial infarction . We hypothesize combined measurement prehospital copeptin in-hospital high sensitive troponin T : 1 . Reduces admission time 1.5 hour patient AMI rule 2 . Reduces time disposition 3 . Is non-inferior compare standard rule-out procedure relation major adverse cardiovascular event . 4 . Is cost efficient compare standard diagnostic strategy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accelerated Rule Out Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suspect Acute Myocardial Infarction ( AMI ) constitute one large patient group emergency medicine . The majority patient , however , cause AMI , chest discomfort many discharge without initiation treatment . ( 1 ) At present , cardiac troponin gold standard diagnose AMI . Diagnostic level troponin reach hour onset symptom serial sample recommended interval 3-6 hour confirm rule-out AMI . The novel biomarker copeptin , by-product vasopressin production , release immediately pituitary gland part hormonal response AMI . However , copeptin elevation , specific AMI . Peak concentration copeptin reach within first hour value normalizes within 4-10 hour . ( 3 ) Previous study suggest combination copeptin high-sensitive cardiac troponin T ( hs-cTnT ) early reliable rule-out AMI . ( 2,3,6 ) These study base copeptin measurement blood sample acquire hospital admission . However , rapid release copeptin , blood sampling perform early possible symptom onset , preferably already ambulance , whereas analysis perform arrival hospital copeptin stable . The PREHAB trial conduct Central Denmark Region , document prehospital blood sampling perform 70 minute earlier first in-hospital sample . ( 5 ) Post-trial analysis blood sample PREHAP trial demonstrate potential early safe rule-out AMI use combination prehospital copeptin in-hospital troponin analysis . AMI could potentially safely , rule approximately 40-50 % patient , AMI diagnosis eventually dismiss . During last 7 year , study evaluate effect validity prehospital blood sample analysis . This standard procedure The Central Denmark Region , Denmark . ( 5 ) Currently , prehospital blood sample carry two major randomize study , aim identify patient myocardial infarction heart failure ( NCT01638806 NCT02050282 ) . Unfortunately , present point-of-care analysis equipment copeptin available . Manufacturer copeptin analysis equipment , Thermo Fischer , inform development point-care-care equipment process , available near future . Therefore , perform in-hospital analysis prehospital blood sample . Overall aim protocol demonstrate combination troponin T copeptin safe effective biomarker rule-out AMI . In randomized setting , compare combination prehospital copeptin hospital hs-cTnT , standard diagnostic procedure patient suspect AMI , evaluate rule-out potential potential reduction length stay hospital . The diagnostic effect measure copeptin/ hs-cTnT prehospital v in-hospital blood sample evaluate . Moreover diagnostic rule-out strategy , use hs-cTNT admission 1 hour admission , evaluate retrospective analysis blood sample acquire patient conventional diagnostics arm study . Primary purpose AROMI trial : 1 . To evaluate early discharge , base combine biomarker analysis associate duration hospital stay . Will evaluate interim analysis inclusion 300 patient site ( No interim evaluation MACE outcome ) 2 . To evaluate early discharge , base combine biomarker analysis associate major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) index admission , discharge , within 30 , 90 , 365 day randomization ( separately combination ) . Secondary purpose AROMI trial : 1 . To evaluate early discharge , base combine biomarker analysis associate time decision discharge continue hospitalization . Will evaluate interim analysis inclusion 300 patient site ( No interim evaluation MACE outcome ) 2 . To evaluate early discharge , base combine biomarker analysis cost-effective regard satisfaction safety patient perspective . 3 . To evaluate early discharge , base combine biomarker analysis cost-effective public perspective , regard staff resource , cost hospital stay , adherence labour market , use healthcare service , Cost benefit analysis ( CBA ) . 4 . To evaluate early discharge , base hs-cTnT analysis arrival 1 hour arrival hospital associate duration hospital stay . 5 . To evaluate early discharge , base hs-cTnT analysis arrival 1 hour arrival hospital associate MACE ( major adverse cardiac event ) index admission , discharge , within 30 , 90 , 365 day randomization ( separately combination ) .</detailed_description>
