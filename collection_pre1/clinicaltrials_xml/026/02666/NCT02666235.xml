	<detailed_description>Intermittent arm cuff inflation reduces extent heart muscle injury time cardiovascular injury . The intervention know remote ischaemic conditioning ( RIC ) however mechanisms RIC act incompletely understood . One mechanism might explain benefit RIC improvement coronary artery function turn might help improve blood flow heart muscle . The primary aim determine whether intermittent inflation blood pressure cuff 5 min period 200 mmHg 4 occasion separate 5 minute interval improve coronary vascular function compare cuff placement cuff inflation . A secondary aim determine whether RIC alters circulate concentration small molecule hormone systemic blood regulate coronary endothelial function . The investigator perform randomise controlled trial RIC minimum 60 patient know suspected angina coronary angiography angioplasty would consider . A screen log prospectively record . In order enrol prior knowledge coronary anatomy disease necessary , information obtain screen referral invasive angiography follow non-invasive CT coronary angiography , stag invasive management angioplasty intend follow initial invasive angiography . The protocol initially involve two coronary angiogram coronary reactivity test day , first angiogram take place RIC-COR intervention second angiogram take place immediately afterwards . However , enrol 10 participant evident total procedure time hospital stay unduly long impractical . Therefore , follow consultation trial biostatistician , funder ethic committee , protocol amend initial angiogram remove ( May 2012 ) . There change study design . Following change service arrangement elective referral coronary angioplasty hospital , constraint around staff illness availability , recruitment temporarily suspend logistical ground ( September 2013 November 2014 ) . Following informed consent invasive procedure , patient randomly assign intervention group ( cuff inflation protocol ) control group ( cuff placement , inflation ; sham protocol ) . The clinical team blind treatment group assignment . Clinically-indicated coronary angiography perform first , include administration glyceryl trinitrate ( 200 - 400 microgram ; short act preparation ) attenuate coronary artery tone . Based angiographic finding , cardiologist select coronary artery minimal evidence coronary artery disease . Endothelial function assess artery intra-coronary infusion acetylcholine ( ACh ) incremental dos . Non-endothelium dependent vasodilation assess use intra-coronary administration glyceryl trinitrate end infusion protocol . An infusion catheter use selectively instrument coronary artery interest . The factor influence selection coronary artery study include 1 ) minimal angiographic evidence coronary disease , 2 ) practical consideration insertion intra-coronary catheter ie . vessel tortuosity , calibre . The coronary reactivity protocol involve intra-coronary administration study drug rate 2 ml/min 2 minute follow order : 1 ) 0.9 % normal saline ; 2 ) ACh 10-6 Molar ( M ) , 3 ) ACh 10-5M , 4 ) ACh 10-4M , 5 ) 0.9 % normal saline ; finally , 6 ) bolus intra-coronary administration 200-400 microgram glyceryl trinitrate . The patient 's clinical response assess prospectively , include continuous haemodynamic recording ( heart rate , rhythm , conduction aortic blood pressure ) . A 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) cine coronary angiogram obtain synchronously baseline , end 2 minute infusion , follow nitrate administration . Coronary diameter measure procedure use computer-assisted quantitative coronary analysis ( QCA ) custom software ( eg Medis , Leiden , Netherlands ) , train observer blind allocate group . The coronary segment analysis locate distal infusion catheter proximal - mid segment right coronary artery main branch leave coronary artery . The segment minimal angiographic evidence coronary disease . The length segment 30 mm . The angiographic projection use analysis . The software calibrate catheter . Mean lumen diameter mean coronary area compute . Epicardial spasm , define &gt; 90 % reduction coronary artery diameter ischaemic ST-segment change ECG , microvascular spasm , define ischaemic ST-segment change without epicardial coronary vasoconstriction &gt; 90 % assess . ECG change , include alteration atrio-ventricular conduction ST-segment deviation , prospectively record . Since neuro-hormonal response may potentially mediate RIC , blood test perform cuff placement patient ( active control group ) measure circulate molecule know regulate blood vessel function . The study data analyse biostatistician independent research team . If investigator discover effect , , RIC coronary vascular function , potentially information would provide new insight mechanisms action RIC .</detailed_description>
