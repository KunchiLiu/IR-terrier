	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial study side effect best dose bispecific antibody arm activated T-cells give together aldesleukin sargramostim see well work treat patient pancreatic cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node ( locally advance ) place body ( metastatic ) . Bispecific antibody arm activated T-cells patient 's T cell coat bispecific antibody comprise 2 antibody chemically join together . These antibody specific target bind property may give T cell great ability seek , attach , kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Confirm single dose phase I ( 3 6 patient [ pt ] ) 8 infusion 10^10 epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) bispecific antibody arm activated T cell ( BATs ) give twice per week combination interleukin ( IL ) -2 ( aldesleukin ) ( 300,000 IU/m^2/day ) granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) ( sargramostim ) ( 250 ug/m^2/twice weekly ) begin 3 day 1st infusion end day last infusion safe . II . Perform phase II clinical trial estimate clinical efficacy 8 infusion 10^10 EGFR BATs combination IL-2 GM-CSF 39 evaluable pt ( include 3-6 pt single dose phase I ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine infusion EGFR BATs significantly increase cellular humoral anti-pancreatic cancer ( PC ) responses peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) different time point last EGFR BATs infusion response persist beyond 2 month ( mo ) . II . Obtain original tumor paraffin block prior treatment evaluate block cluster differentiation ( CD ) 3 , CD4 , CD8 , program cell death ( PD ) 1/programmed cell death ligand ( PDL ) 1 , monocyte subpopulation , myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSC ) , cytoplasmic interferon ( IFN ) -gamma IL-10 immunohistochemical staining quantitate type number tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) tumor microenvironment estimate whether type number correlate clinical response . III . To determine time progression ( TTP ) . OUTLINE : This phase Ib , dose-escalation study anti-CD3 x anti-EGFR-bispecific antibody arm activate T-cells follow phase II study . Patients receive one follow standard chemotherapy regimens discretion treat physician : gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute ; gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30-40 minute ; oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour ; fluorouracil IV 46 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour . Approximately 2 week standard chemotherapy completion , patient receive anti-CD3 x anti-EGFR-bispecific antibody arm activated T-cells IV 5-30 minute twice weekly 4 week . Patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) sargramostim SC day -3 first anti-CD3 x anti-EGFR-bispecific antibody arm activated T-cells infusion continue twice weekly final infusion . After completion study treatment , patient follow 18 month .</detailed_description>
