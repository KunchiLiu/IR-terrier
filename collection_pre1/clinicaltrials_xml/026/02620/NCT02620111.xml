	<brief_title>Protein Balance Protein Supplemented Elderly Patients : Acute Study With Protein-tracer-techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Improved muscle function/strength enhance quality life frail elderly population . Dietary protein amino acid act anabolic substrate muscle elderly people . In particular amino acid leucine suggest impact muscle protein synthesis . In collaboration Danish dairy company Arla Foods use conventional Whey protein leucine enrich Whey protein acute study elderly patient . Our aim examine acute effect supplementation whey protein high leucine compare whey protein normal leucine content muscle protein synthesis protein balance elderly patient . Methods : We include 10 elderly patient , age 60-85 year randomize crossover study . The subject recruit Osteoporosis Section Department Endocrinology Aarhus University Hospital . The subject control 2 x 1 day intervention A : whey protein high leucine B : whey protein normal leucine content . Interventions conduct 4 week washout period . On intervention day postprandial protein synthesis rate measure 2 X 3h use tracer infuse protocol 15Nphenylalanine along blood sample muscle biopsy . For analyze step signal muscle protein synthesis initiate leucine mammalian target rapamycin ( mTor ) sit downstream mTor quantify use western blotting . Whole body protein kinetics calculate use formula Q=i*Ei/Ep-i</detailed_description>
