	<brief_title>Study Pembrolizumab With REOLYSIN® Chemotherapy Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reovirus Serotype 3 - Dearing Strain ( REOLYSIN® ) naturally occur , ubiquitous , non-enveloped human reovirus . It 's primary mode activity infect selectively target tumor activate Ras pathway mutation . Up 70 % pancreatic cancer activate Ras pathway mutation and/ over-expressions . This open label , Phase 1b study REOLYSIN® chemotherapy combination pembrolizumab patient advance ( unresectable metastatic ) histologically confirm pancreatic adenocarcinoma progress ( tolerate ) first-line therapy . It think Reovirus combine chemotherapy would lead increased viral replication oncolysis preferentially RAS activate tumor , result immunogenic response enhance checkpoint inhibition use pembrolizumab . The study design characterize efficacy safety REOLYSIN® give intravenously combination one three chemotherapy backbone regimens , Gemcitabine , Irinotecan Leucovorin/ 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , pembrolizumab , treatment cycle repeat every 3 week . It follow 3+3 design dose escalation . 3 patient initially enrol . If dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) observe , cohort expand . Provided patient develop intolerable toxicity ( respond either supportive care dose reduction ) clinically meaningful disease progression , treatment additional cycle may continue long patient experience clinical benefit judgement Investigator .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each patient MUST : Have histologically confirm advanced metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma fail tolerate firstline therapy . Have either archival tissue available immune testing OR , baseline biopsy primary metastatic lesion ( include ascites ) accessible biopsy accomplish reasonable safety . Be available agree ; posttreatment tumor biopsy either primary metastatic lesion ( include ascites ) . Have measurable disease . Have continue acute toxic effect ( except alopecia ) prior anticancer treatment , i.e. , effect must resolve Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , version 4.02 [ 2 ] , Grade ≤1 . Any major surgery ( except biopsy ) must occur least 28 day prior study enrolment . Have ECOG Performance Score ≤ 2 . Have baseline laboratory result follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10E9 [ SI unit 10E9/L ] . Platelets ≥ 100 x10E9 [ SI unit 10E9/L ] ( without platelet transfusion ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Creatinine clearance ( measure 24 hour ) OR calculate creatinine clearance ( CockcroftGault formula ) ≥ 60 mL/min . Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN . AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN patient liver metastasis ) . TSH , T4 ACTH must within normal range . Proteinuria normal grade 1 OR Urinary protein &lt; 1 g/24hr . Negative pregnancy test female childbearing potential . Have sign inform consent indicate patient aware neoplastic nature disease inform procedure protocol , experimental nature therapy , alternative , potential benefit , side effect , risk , discomfort . Be willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test . Each patient MUST NOT : Receive concurrent therapy investigational anticancer agent study . Be immunosuppressive therapy know HIV infection active hepatitis B C. Receive radiotherapy within 28 day prior receive study drug . Be pregnant breastfeed woman . Female patient childbearing potential must agree use effective contraception , must surgically sterile , must postmenopausal . Male patient must agree use effective contraception surgically sterile . Barrier method recommend form contraception . Have clinically significant cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association , Class III IV ) include preexist arrhythmia , uncontrolled angina pectoris , myocardial infarction 1 year prior study entry , grade 2 high compromise leave ventricular ejection fraction . Have dementia alter mental status would prohibit informed consent . Have severe , acute , chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment Principal Investigator , would make patient inappropriate study . Have HIGH BURDEN/SYMPTOMATIC brain metastasis . LOW VOLUME / ASYMPTOMATIC pretreated clinically stable brain metastasis ARE allow .</criteria>
