	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect early administration intravenous ( IV ) Tranexamic acid ( TA ) perioperative bleeding ( define measure intraoperative estimate blood loss ( EBL ) , change pre post-operative hemoglobin ( Hb ) , frequency blood transfusion ) woman undergo myomectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Intravenous Tranexamic Acid During Myomectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide 25 % woman develop uterine leiomyoma . Most myomas asymptomatic however 20 25 % woman myomas develop symptom , heavy menstrual bleeding , require treatment . For woman fail medical management desire preserve fertility and/or uterus , surgical removal fibroid ( myomectomy ) major option . Myomectomy associate short long-term complication , significantly , hemorrhage need conversion hysterectomy 2 % case , need blood transfusion 20 % case , prolong postoperative stay , potentially life-threatening . As , various treatment suggest decrease blood loss myomectomy include pharmacologic manipulation coagulation cascade use agent tranexamic acid ( TA ) . Despite many describe method reduce intraoperative bleeding , massive hemorrhage myomectomy remain significant challenge gynecologic surgeon . TA synthetic lysine derivative antifibrinolytic activity help prevent clot break . It currently clinically use widely stop heavy menstrual bleed many investigator ' myomectomy patient take oral TA around time surgery . Systematic review randomize control trial ( RCTs ) include 25,000 patient tranexamic acid elective surgery show reduce risk blood transfusion 34 % ( relative risk ( RR ) 0.61 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.53 0.70 ) without increase risk venous thrombus embolus ( VTE ) adverse perioperative outcome ( Henry , 2011 ) . Only one RCT study use TA gynecologic surgery . This study randomize double blind placebo control trial intravenous TA 10 mg/kg ( maximum 1g ) versus placebo myomectomy procedure . Although 63 ml decrease postoperative blood loss ( p &lt; 0.01 ) , significant difference find two group term perioperative blood loss , change hemoglobin , rate allogeneic blood transfusion . Further study need different dose administration confirm true role TA reduction blood loss myomectomy . If difference see , result future publication would directly impact clinical care locally abroad , method currently exist prevent hemorrhage myomectomy procedure .</detailed_description>
