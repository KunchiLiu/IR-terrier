	<brief_title>Smart-phone Health Coaching Intervention Promote Maintenance Exercise Breast Cancer Survivors : Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order advance PA adoption maintenance BrCaS , innovative health coach intervention us mobile , wearable technology ( iMOVE ) develop . This pilot study evaluate iMOVE inform design large pragmatic randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Main Hypotheses : 1 ) The study adequately recruit ( &gt; 40 % ) retain ( &gt; 75 % ) participant , 2 ) intervention highly acceptable participant result substantial sustained fitness improvement . Aims Pilot Study Aim 1 : To evaluate feasibility method employ define ) ability recruit &gt; 40 % eligible ; b ) adequate retention , operationalized 6-month assessment completion &gt; 75 % participant ; c ) adequate adherence , operationalized â‰¥70 % intervention component complete . Aim 2 : To evaluate acceptability feedback final refinement optimization intervention . Aim 3 : To determine preliminary intervention efficacy fitness ( primary ) patient-reported , anthropometric physical ( secondary ) outcomes . This pilot RCT enroll inactive BrCa survivor ( BrCaS ) stratify age ( &lt; 55/ &gt; 55 yr ) adjuvant hormone therapy ( AHT ) exposure [ AHT yes/AHT ] . Recruitment undertaken Princess Margaret Cancer Centre ( PM ) intervention occur Electronic Living Library Cancer Survivorship Research ( ELLICSR ) , Cancer Survivorship Wellness Centre Toronto General Hospital ( TGH ) . Both PM TGH member University Health Network Toronto , Ontario research ethic board approval obtain University Health Network ( 13-6157-DE ) . Patients , identify weekly-generated clinic list chart review , approach member clinical team interested meet research assistant explain study screen eligibility . Participants also recruit advertisement flyer locate common hospital area . Eligibility ascertain over-the-phone possible , write consent obtain person prior randomization . After participant complete baseline questionnaires initial physiological assessment , stratification-related data ( age , AHT status , eligibility ID ) email biostatistician Department Biostatistics PM perform randomization sends Study ID experimental control group allocation . Intervention Participants experimental control condition receive 12-weeks PA training include weekly group session certify exercise physiologist ( CEP ) register kinesiologist ( RKin ) , progressively structure , individualized home-based exercise program . The program base American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) guideline model successful , theory-based , mixed-modality program develop Santa Mina et al . The individually-tailored exercise prescription combine aerobic-resistance exercise flexibility training , progress CEP/RKin 's guidance towards increase intensity improved fitness . Based ACSM guideline goal least 150 minute per week moderate-intensity aerobic activity . Carefully calibrated increase exercise volume 12 week intend minimize injury risk potential discouragement variation progress . Weekly group session 60 minute duration ( include aerobic resistance training ) optimize social reinforcement . Participants provide choice days/times weekly supervise session . Participants also ask complete 3-5 additional home-based session aerobic ( e.g . brisk walking , cycle ) , resistance activity ( use elastic band body weight lift exercise ) week . Initial intensity base performance exercise group session CEP/RKin self-monitored via 10-point rating perceive exertion , prescribe train zone 4-7 . Participants keep weekly exercise log review face-to-face meeting CEP/RKin . All participant provide exercise manual include exercise description instructive photograph , exercise safety guideline , stretch instruction . After participant recruit enrolled , semi-structured exit interview complete N = 25 participant week # intervention . Experimental Group To promote adoption maintenance fitness PA level , experimental group participant concurrently provide smart-phone-based health coaching intervention ( iMOVE ) . iMOVE three component : 1 ) one-on-one telephone-based counselling ; 2 ) supportive software smart-phone device ( HealthCoach program ) , 3 ) use Fit-bit corresponding software . The iMOVE intervention design enhance sustain behavior change : PA , integrate several element term smart-phone-based health coaching , base multiple behavior-change theory , specifically Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) ; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) , TPB , TTM ; Social Learning Theory Relapse Prevention Therapy . Once decision regularly exercise make ( TTM ) , participant elicit support influential individual ( TPB-SLT ) undertake session progress high fitness level ( SLT-progressive mastery ) . Participants additionally support observation peer progress peer-familial social support disruption regularity occur ( SLT - social modeling/social support ) . The careful monitoring subjective state sensitizes subject regulatory effect ( elevate mood , reduce fatigue ) , prepare confront adherence disruption re-decision process ( TTM ) re-mobilization ( RPT-TTM ) . Instead react self-blame , temporary setback become prolapse trial-and-error learn build future success ( RPT ) . Consistently adherent behaviour ultimately include non-adherent lapse recovery effective routine ( TTM-RPT ) . The theoretical construct employ base promote motivation establishing : ) exercise self-efficacy , b ) social support exercise c ) positive exercise-induced feeling acute intervention ( 12 week ) post-exercise program period ( 6 month ) . The telephone-based health coach portion iMOVE include 10 x 30-minute telephone call train health coach schedule week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 12 ( exercise program ) week 20 28 ( post-exercise program booster session ) . The call focus assessment motivation , promotion self-efficacy collaborative problem solve . Telephone base counsel provide several advantage face-to-face counselling , notably potential multi-regional population access give telephone widely available communication medium require travel user provider . The focus assess motivation , promote self-efficacy mutual problem solve promote PA maintenance . The selected schedule provide support build autonomy independent motivation . The primary approach use health coach MI CBT . MI collaborative , person-centered counselling method elicit strengthens motivation behaviour-change resolve ambivalence . MI demonstrate effectiveness increase PA cancer survivor chronic condition MI-related effect show endure two year post-intervention . Whenever self-efficacy appear impede distorted cognition , CBT principles apply , particularly positively affect mood fluctuation . Distorted cognition prevent enactment health-behaviors drive unhealthy behavior . With CBT , distort cognition modify , prevent ameliorate associate negative emotional response . Telephone-based intervention effective acceptable BrCa patient useful deliver MI-type/CBT intervention , include Diabetes health coaching study . As common MI CBT intervention , handbook create , include global objective per session relevant clinical tool health coach use navigate session . An agenda session facilitate health coach base patient goal , activity , motivation collect software ( between-sessions ) session . Health coach counsel background MI CBT experience work BrCa population , receive clinical supervision Registered Psychologist Motivational Interviewing Network Trainers ( MINT ) certify trainer . Fidelity intervention assess routine review implementation fidelity . In addition schedule telephone-based session , participant interact HealthCoach software via smart-phone . This software , previously successfully tested participant diagnose type II diabetes , tailor BrCa . It provide participant specific health tip ( deliver video verbally ) , ability track PA , nutrition , pain psychological well ( mood , energy ) ; also support goal setting ( selective automatic daily/hourly reminder ) . All entry software time-stamped , allow graph creation time combine multiple tracker , enable participant health coach see health indicator change relation active health practice . The use software 's capability initiate contact health coach via text messaging quantify record . When patient text health coach via app health coach record number time contact take place text message content . Confirmation text message provide direct patient discus matter next phone session . Any content indicate medical emergency need deal immediately contact patient make . The use Fit-bit flex provide another way help participant remain adherent PA routine . Its real time feedback activity ( lights device indicate % completion pre-set 10000 step goal ) , well connectivity Connected Wellness platform allow participant Health Coach jointly explore PA achieve walk integrate participant life . It simple display 5 LED light indicate number step take daily , vibrates indicate pre-set goal 10000 step reach . The light also indicate battery level . The Fit-bit Flex include specialized universal series bus ( USB ) charger ; battery charge last five seven day , take one two hour charge . The tracker measure step take , combine user data calculate distance walk , calorie burn , activity duration-intensity .
