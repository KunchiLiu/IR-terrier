	<brief_summary>The main aim WESTCOR study - investigate ability two high sensitive cardiac troponin ( hs-cTn ) assay diagnose acute coronary syndrome predict prognosis different patient population ( e.g . gender , age co-morbidity ) - validate suggest 1 hour protocol rule rule acute coronary syndrome two hs-cTn assay unselected chest pain population - investigate different biomarkers ability predict long term prognosis hospitalization chest pain</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aiming Towards Evidence Based Interpretation Cardiac Biomarkers Patients Presenting With Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The WESTCOR-study include patient present Emergency Department Haukeland University Hospital Stavanger University Hospital symptom indicative acute coronary syndrome . 1500 patient include Haukeland University Hospital 1500 Stavanger University Hospital . The two location use different high sensitive troponin assay ( i.e . hs-cTnT hs-cTnI ( Abbott Diagnostics ) routine diagnostic coronary syndrome . 3000 patient sample hs-cTnT hs-cTnI measure admission , three hour 8-12 hour . Clinicians blind result hs-cTn assay use routine assay locally . Final diagnosis make two independent cardiologist base available clinical information result routine test . The ability diagnose exclude MI different sample point different patient population compare two hs troponin assay . Differences clinical follow-up compare two location related eventual difference hs-cTn result . Analytical interference measure different assay . 1500 patient additional sample 1 hour admission . The clinician blind result sample ( hs-cTn assay ) . The ability one-hour sample diagnose exclude myocardial infraction ( MI ) compare two assay . All patient follow-up sample 3 month discharge . The patient follow 20 year national register prognostic value hs-cTn concentration dynamic well biomarkers , measure .</detailed_description>
