	<brief_title>The Effect Transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulation Reducing Oesophageal Pain Hypersensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic oesophageal pain symptomatic feature disorder erosive oesophagitis , non-erosive reflux disease non-cardiac chest pain . Patients often display heighten sensitivity intra-oesophageal stimulus , refer oesophageal pain hypersensitivity . However , experience oesophageal pain highly individual multitude factor propose account variability . Amongst physiological factor autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) . The ANS postulate play pivotal role modulation pain multiple interaction pain processing . The ANS two broadly antithetic branch , parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) . The primary neural substrate PNS vagus nerve . The vagus nerve increasingly consider play integral role modulate oesophageal pain . Electrical vagal nerve stimulation ( VNS ) first use human 1988 efficacious treatment drug resistant epilepsy . Traditional VNS undertaken procedure bipolar helical electrode place around cervical vagal nerve , connect pulse generator place subcutaneous pocket chest , dissimilar cardiac pacemaker . However , method VNS necessitate surgical implantation attendant risk complication . Recently , external transcutaneous VNS ( t-VNS ) system , consist earplug-like electrode interface concha outer ear handheld battery-powered electrical stimulator , become commercially available ( NEMOS system ) . The auricular branch vagus nerve innervate concha ear locate directly skin , make suitable target transcutaneous stimulation . t-VNS demonstrate safe , well tolerate high degree user-friendliness . A preliminary study report t-VNS reduces sensitivity heat pain healthy volunteer . Furthermore , recent study demonstrate t-VNS pattern cerebral activation , determine functional magnetic resonance imaging , similar evoke traditional VNS . Thus , VNS per se represent attractive proposition investigate role PNS oesophageal pain t-VNS specifically , viable , safe acceptable technology achieve . The pivotal experiment evaluate analgesic role VNS development acid induce oesophageal pain hypersensitivity conduct . Using aforementioned model oesophageal pain hypersensitivity , seek determine analgesic effect t-VNS .</detailed_description>
