	<brief_summary>Methods : Double blind , randomize control trial 1:1 allocation mifepristone placebo initiation induction labor fetal demise 20 week estimate gestational age great . Hypothesis : Mifepristone expedite time delivery fetus among demise patient , compare placebo , conjunction pharmacologic method induction labor .

	<brief_title>Mifepristone Induction Fetal Demise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial time initiation induction labor fetal demise 20 week gestational age great . 1 . Diagnose fetal demise : confirm absence fetal heart motion attend physician per institutional standard protocol . 2 . Confirm gestational age presentation labor delivery base available medical record and/or ultrasonography per standard practice institutional protocol . 3 . Based inclusion exclusion criterion potential participant inform research , offer opportunity contribute , train research staff complete informed consent process . After documentation consent discussion research indicate participant randomize intervention control arm . Both group receive emotional physical support induction labor per practice guideline standard care Montefiore physician , faculty staff irrespective participation assignment . 4 . Interventional Arm : Ingest 200mg tab mifepristone orally . This coincide implement prior initiation induction labor plan delineate attend physician . The timing sensitive need participant labor delivery room staff . 5 . Control Arm : Ingest placebo tab orally similar physical property . This coincide implement prior initiation induction labor plan delineate attend physician . The timing sensitive need participant labor delivery room staff . 6 . Montefiore protocol induction labor : follow institutional standard . 7 . Data : Patient data collect Labor Delivery staff via electronic medical record paper record scan electronic medical record . The investigator use data abstraction tool collect information time medication administration , medication administer , time delivery fetus , duration admittance labor delivery , postpartum course , complication electronic medical record .</detailed_description>
