	<brief_title>ARIES Vasculogenic Erectile Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increase number men suffer effect Erectile Dysfunction ( ED ) year . The development oral therapy ( phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor ) successful many disease . However , drug may contraindicate patient cardiovascular risk factor ( often predecessors develop ED ) often ineffective patient comorbid condition , diabetes mellitus . The main objective study determine safety efficacy low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy use Dornier Aries treatment erectile dysfunction vasculogenic origin . This protocol allow treatment 23 men 21-75 year age vasculogenic erectile dysfunction least 6 month ' duration low intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy utilize Dornier Aries device . This protocol include application 5000 shockwaves per session 5 treatment area 1000 SW energy level 4-5 ( energy flux density ( 0.051-0.062 mJ/mm² ) , move applicator along penile shaft within treatment area . The maximum energy apply treatment would 23.35J . Conversely , treatment protocol describe within design actually restore penile function disease-modifying therapy , expect require maintenance regimen continue treatment , previous study demonstrate retained benefit six month end treatment . Dornier MedTech hire independent party monitor data perform internal audit ensure precision , quality , integrity data collect .
