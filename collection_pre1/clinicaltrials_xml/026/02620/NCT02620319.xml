	<detailed_description>Background : The ideal airway stent yet develop . Biodegradable ( BD ) stent make knit polymer fiber degrade place body ; extraction device , therefore , unnecessary . Several vitro vivo study tracheal BD stent compose various material conduct . Polydioxanone biodegradable polymer polyester family , attract lot interest due exquisite biocompatibility currently available market form absorbable suture material . It degrade hydrolysis ( ester bond ) , accelerate low potential Hydrogen ( pH ) condition , harmless degradation product . Polydioxanone tracheal stent appear well tolerated tracheal mucosa , retain mechanical strength long 6 week , , animal model , completely degrade approximately 15 week . They successfully use human mechanical support tracheal transplant , treatment obstructive airway complication lung transplantation , child airway stenosis . Hypotheses : Biodegradable stent use adult patient temporary mechanical support narrow airway , allow heal airway secure airways another ( anticancer , anti-inflammatory ) therapy manage cause narrowing . Biodegradable stent expect advantage classical stent , namely good biocompatibility , fair adaptation anatomy airway , limit transportation secretion substantially . Objectives : The primary objective study show BD stent safely use effective treatment adult patient tracheal narrowing . The secondary objective : observe analyze mucosa - BD stent interaction , assess degradation stent consequence . Design : Prospective interventional study conduct three hospital Czech Republic . Methods : The investigator intend enroll adult participant suffer significant large airway stenoses stenting generally consider effective . Every participant review least two interventional pulmonologists thoracic surgeon determine best therapeutic option . Bronchoscopy compute tomography trachea consider essential confirm diagnosis . All participant sign inform consent form prior undergoing procedure . During stent implantation , trachea intubate rigid bronchoscope , participant place total intravenous anesthesia jet ventilation . The investigator intend use self-expandable , biodegradable , polydioxanone tracheal stent , SX-ELLA Stent DV Tracheal ( DV Stent ) , manufacture ELLA-CS , s.r.o. , Hradec Kralove , Czech Republic . Stent standardly equip radiopaque marker distal proximal end . It deliver sterile pack , separately original delivery system stent immediately implantation place . As mentioned , stent make synthetic polymer - braid polydioxanone fiber widely use absorbable surgical suture . The suture successfully use surgery , orthopedics dental surgery 25 year . It known material subject bulk hydrolytic degradation body . No toxic substance arise within degradation process . The ultimate degradation substance 2-hydroxyacetic acid finally metabolized water carbon dioxide . The data local reaction produce polydioxanone implant , incl . bury suture contradictory . Majority report low tissue reaction . The first bronchoscopy follow carry first post-implantation week , additional follow-up ( include clinical evaluation , bronchoscopy , basic spirometry , chest X-ray need ) perform monthly as-needed basis . If restenosis threatens , participant give another polydioxanone stent , well , treat use mechanical removal obstacle , balloon dilation , laser therapy electrocautery . Results analyze continuously , final evaluation intend perform reach sufficient number participant . This include statistical analysis overall result participant complete stent degradation , assessment major clinical sign functional parameter , especially , evaluation endoscopic finding .</detailed_description>
