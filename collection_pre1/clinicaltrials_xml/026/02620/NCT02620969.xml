	<brief_summary>Children chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) suffer one devastating diseases childhood result lifelong need health care , 3 time decreased life expectancy . In addition , important comorbidities negatively impact quality life integration society , jeopardize future even potential transplantation . Retention uraemic toxin accept play major role pathogenesis comorbid condition , study child lack . Furthermore , currently good tool evaluate severity monitor adequacy treatment , result suboptimal management . The overall scientific objective four year UToPaed IWT-TBM project provide clinician new diagnostic therapeutic tool management child CKD , base improve understanding uraemic toxicity . In first part UToPaed , investigator associate concentration wide variety uraemic toxin different comorbidities CKD child . In second part , kinetic analysis perform unravel distribution transport different study uraemic toxin body patient . The toxin concentration best correlate comorbidities progress CKD ( UToPaed - part 1 : observational study ) representative kinetics select marker . These marker , together comorbidities , track intervention , i.e . start dialysis , transplantation , change dialysis strategy ( UToPaed - part 3 - intervention study ) order validate different kinetic model . From validate kinetic model ( UToPaed - part 2 3 ) , open access user-friendly prediction simulator ( PAEDSIM ) base patient characteristic marker concentration develop optimise individualise dialysis therapy . By provide clinician advanced appropriate tool improve management child CKD , i.e . well assessment degree renal dysfunction , good determination ideal time start renal replacement therapy , accurate monitoring dialysis adequacy , investigator aim improve neurocognitive psychosocial functioning ( short term ) , growth , maturation puberty , social integration ( median term ) survival ( long term ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uraemic Toxins Chronic Kidney Disease Paediatric Patients : Kinetic Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational multicenter study 20 child ( ≤ 18 year ) chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) stage 5D treated haemodialysis . Distribution transport uraemic toxin inside body derive cross-sectional study . During midweek haemodialysis session , blood sample dialyser inlet line different time point ( e.g . 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 240min ) session obtain evolution intradialytic concentration need kinetic analysis . To calculate dialyser clearance , blood sample simultaneously dialyser inlet outlet first part session ( e.g . 30min ) . Total solute removal measure partial dialysate collection entire dialysis duration , use validate sample system . For uraemic toxin study , kinetic model calibrate simulate distribution mass transport inside patient 's body . The body characterise total distribution volume V ( per toxin ) , consist one distinct compartment . In e.g . 2-compartment model , one distinguish plasmatic peripheral compartment , directly clear haemodialysis ( i.e . dialyser clearance ) renal extrarenal clearance , extraplasmatic compartment ( ) . Each compartment assume characterise homogeneous uraemic toxin concentration variable input output . The solute transport two compartment consider driven concentration gradient ( diffusion ) , and/or pressure gradient ( convection ) characterise intercompartment clearance . Presuming removal generation equilibrium stable HD patient , solute generation rate interdialytic period assume equal total solute removal dialysis session . The patient-specific ultrafiltration rate take account change total distribution volume time . The time variation compartment concentration , particular toxin , determine solve mass balance equation compartment . The kinetic model iteratively solve equation complete dialysis session time . Herewith , plasmatic volume , total distribution volume , well intercompartment clearance calculate fitting solution measure patient 's plasma concentration . Such kinetic analysis result knowledge kinetic parameter study toxin . These calibrate kinetic model paediatrics used simulate different dialysis strategy , , look optimal one , experience investigator kinetic study adult . Herewith , per solute , inter- intradialytic evolution concentration calculate accord mass balance equation per compartment use derive kinetic parameter . In interdialytic period , dialyser clearance keep zero , solute generation maintain constant , interdialytic volume gain set equal intradialytic apply ultrafiltration rate . Starting intra- interdialytic concentration steady state 3x4 hour dialysis schedule , intra- interdialytic concentration calculate mathematically alter several key characteristic dialysis regime . This do individual paediatric patient data well average paediatric patient within age category data emanate primary kinetic analysis . Possible strategy : longer and/or frequent dialysis without adapt blood and/or dialysate flow rate , increase convection , haemodiafiltration ( pre , post , mixed dilution ) , combination accounting different parameter . For strategy , consecutive session simulate new steady state predialysis solute concentration reach ( deviation 2 consecutive session &lt; 1 % ) , parallel real vivo effect alter dialysis strategy . The different strategy evaluate mathematically compare calculate total solute removal first week new strategy , steady state time average well predialysis concentration plasmatic volume . The calibrated kinetic modelling parameter result different dialysis strategy compare different study uraemic toxin . Accounting correlation comorbidities ( UToPaed-part 1 ) , one ( ) uraemic toxin marker ( ) chosen . The kinetic model validate quantify uraemic toxin marker concentration comorbidities individual patient switch different strategy well individualise optimal dialysis strategy base model ( UToPaed- part 3 ) .</detailed_description>
