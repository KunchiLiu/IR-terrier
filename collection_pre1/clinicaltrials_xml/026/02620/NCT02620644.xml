	<brief_summary>Neuroretinal damage diabetes produce functional abnormality loss chromatic discrimination , contrast sensitivity dark adaptation . These alteration detect mean electrophysiological study diabetic patient diabetes duration less two year , i.e . microvascular lesion detect ophthalmologic examination . Neurodegeneration seem generalized process occur throughout macula confine local abnormality , case visible sign retinopathy . The debate still open whether diabetic retinal neuropathy effect vascular diabetic retinopathy primarily cause direct neurologic damage chronic hyperglycemia . The hypothesis diabetes cause retinal neuro-pathy independent retinopathy intrigue potentially link retinal neuropathy diabetic neuropathy . Neuroretinal degeneration initiate and/or activate several metabolic signal pathway participate microangiopathic process well disruption blood-retinal barrier crucial element pathogenesis diabetic retinopathy . Retinal ganglion cell earliest cell affected high rate apoptosis . However , elevated rate apoptosis also observe out nuclear layer ( photoreceptors ) retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) . The use spectral domain OCT ( SD-OCT ) make possible measure thickness individual layer high resolution indicate thin inner retina macula primarily due loss ganglion cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective case-control study conduct October 2012 April 2013 Kasr Al-ainy hospital- cairo university . The subject divide two group ; Group 1 consist diabetic patient free diabetic retinopathy ( 45 eye ) . Group 2 consist non-diabetic subject , free ocular pathology ( 21 eye ) . All subject subject full medical ophthalmological history , refraction , best correct visual acuity ( accord snellen visual acuity chart record decimal ) , slit lamp examination ( include measure intraocular pressure Goldman applanation tonometer ) , dilate fundus examination binocular indirect slit-lamp biomicroscopy measure retinal ganglion cell complex ( GCC ) thickness central foveal thickness ( CFT ) use RTVueÂ® SD-OCT ( Optovue , Inc. ) LASER unit , Kasr Al-ainy hospital . In addition ; diabetic patient subject fundus fluorescein angiography exclude diabetic change could miss clinical examination measure level HbA1C blood kasr Al-ainy hospital chemical pathology unit . Mapping GCC use RTVue GCC scan consist 15 vertical line scan cover 7mm square region . The GCC scan center 1mm temporal fovea center well coverage temporal region . The GCC thickness value analyze compare extensive age-matched normative database . If patient 's value outside normal range , measurement color-coded appropriately . The Deviation Map show percent loss normal determine normative database . The significance Map show region change normal reach statistical significance . ( Figure 1 ) Focal Loss Volume ( FLV ) Global Loss Volume ( GLV ) two parameter provide quantitative measure amount significant GCC loss . GLV measure average amount GCC loss entire GCC map . FLV measure average amount focal loss entire GCC map , total sum significant GCC loss ( volume ) divide map area . As provide percent significant tissue loss volume . FLV detect focal loss use pattern deviation map correct overall absolute change [ 5 ] . Statistical analysis include comparison numerical variable study group do use Student test independent sample normally distribute data Mann Whitney U test independent sample non-normal data . For compare categorical data , Chi square ( 2 ) test perform . Exact test use instead expected frequency less 5 . Within group comparison superior inferior GCC do use McNemar test . Agreement test use kappa statistic . Correlation various variable do use Spearman rank correlation equation . All statistical calculation do use computer program SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Science ; SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) version 15 Microsoft Windows .</detailed_description>
