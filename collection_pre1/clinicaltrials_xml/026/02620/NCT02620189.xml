	<brief_summary>Preliminary data suggest up-regulation Interleukin -17 ( IL-17 ) T-helper 17 ( Th17 ) pathway occur rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) therapy demonstrate incomplete clinical response . A deep understanding require order determine whether IL-17 Th17 pathway valid target intervention population improve response outcome . The study objective observe biologic naïve RA subject anti-TNF therapy take measurement peripheral blood synovial tissue ass difference IL-17 Th17 pathways responder non-responders . The aim study test increase Th17 pathway activity present subject respond clinically anti-TNF therapy . Clinical assessment , synovial bio-markers ultrasound used determinant clinical response . The study may identify disease characteristic determine subject may likely respond anti-TNF therapy , may require either different treatment option , additional pathway inhibition addition TNF , order achieve clinical response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Th17 Responses Evaluated RA Patients Inhibitors TNFα</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aim recruit 50 participant total study . Potential candidate research include active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) symptom , current medication status qualify anti-TNFα therapy . This treatment plan patient place regardless whether take part study ; however , within research environment , information gather may able help good understand level response anti-TNF treatment differs people . Participants ask provide blood urine sample part research . Pieces genetic material call ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) extract study specific blood sample ( synovial tissue patient part biopsy sub-study ) provide participant . This material analyse reveal information gene 'active ' joint environment anti-TNF treatment period . This information tell u protein might involve inflammation affect joint might also able predict type response patient experience response different treatment . The analysis research sample study provide new information mechanism response/non-response anti-TNF therapy . Optional Biopsy sub-study A number participant consent main study invite take part optional biopsy sub-study . This involve take biopsy one affected joint via ultrasound guide procedure . The procedure minimally invasive good safety tolerability participant . The procedure perform local anaesthetic remove tiny piece inflame tissue ( synovial tissue ) lining joint use needle guidance ultrasound scanner . This sub-study collect tissue affect joint help answer research question study Optional DNA genetic sampling Participants also invite take part optional DNA genetic sampling ask contribute DNA sample study . The purpose optional part research study help understand anti-TNF therapy work , may cause side effect , understand rheumatoid arthritis , understand people respond anti-TNF therapy others . Genetic ( genotyping ) test refers patient sample use genetic research . This study DNA determine trait . DNA research also explain people respond well medication others also provide reason people develop diseases others . Samples participant consent optional DNA genetic sampling also use type genetic research call epigenetics . This study chemical modification DNA occur time , without change DNA sequence . These modification control way cell produce protein respond environment . Epigenetics research test diagnose person genetic disease determine whether person may risk develop genetic disease . It use understand prevail disease drug may work different group people . In epigenetic testing , DNA sample participant analysed determine may influence response anti-TNF therapy .</detailed_description>
