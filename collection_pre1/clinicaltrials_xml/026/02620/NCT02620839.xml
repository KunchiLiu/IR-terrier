	<brief_summary>This Phase Ib dose escalation / expansion study combination alpelisib weekly cisplatin . Dose escalation follow standard 3+3 design . During dose escalation , two dose level weekly cisplatin ( 30 35 mg/m2 , respectively ) evaluate combination escalate dos alpelisib parallel . Cohort B ( cisplatin 35 mg/m2 ) give dose level alpelisib open correspond A cohort ( cisplatin 30 mg/m2 ) dose level alpelisib clear DLT window . Cohorts A B may enroll parallel ( e.g. , Cohort 3A may enroll parallel Cohort 2B ) show dose escalation schema . Intermediate dose level alternative dose schedule may investigate per discretion Principal Investigator use 3+3 dose escalation schema ( e.g . cisplatin administer day 1 , 8 21 day cycle ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The start dose alpelisib 200 mg daily chosen base upon aggregate safety , PK , efficacy data show , indicate : 1 . Single agent activity alpelisib daily dos 200 mg 2 . Largely non-overlapping toxicity profile alpelisib cisplatin 3 . MTD alpelisib combination cetuximab prior study 300 mg daily . The investigator escalate 50 mg increment per dose level , maximum dose 350 mg daily . Though single agent MTD/RP2D alpelisib 400 mg , combination variety target therapy MTD/RP2D range 300-350 mg daily . The investigator choose weekly cisplatin dose schedule demonstrate activity squamous cell carcinoma head neck cervix . Both 30 35 mg/m2 cisplatin weekly show activity HNSCC squamous cell histology , investigator investigate dose level combination alpelisib show section 3 protocol .</detailed_description>

Impaired GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral alpelisib ( e.g . Uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , significant small bowel resection ) . Patients currently receive medication know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes ( TdP ) treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug treatment . A list prohibit drug know risk TdP provide Appendix . Patient currently receive treatment drug know strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A .

( Refer Appendix ) Known positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ( baseline testing require ) Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) Patient apply highly effective contraception study duration define final dose study treatment : Sexually active male use condom intercourse take drug 16 week final dose study treatment father child period , may recommend seek advice conservation sperm . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective contraception study least 16 week final dose study treatment . Highly effective contraception define either : Total abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle subject . [ Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception ] .

In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment . Male partner sterilization ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) . [ For female study subject , vasectomize male partner sole partner patient ] . Use combination follow ( a+b ) : Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository . Note : Hormonal contraception method ( e.g . oral , injected , implant ) allow alpelisib may decrease effectiveness hormonal contraceptive . Women consider postmenopausal childbearing potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . For woman therapyinduced amenorrhea , oophorectomy serial measurement FSH and/or estradiol need ensure postmenopausal status .
