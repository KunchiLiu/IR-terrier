	<brief_summary>Knee osteoarthritis ( KOA ) one lead cause low limb disability among elderly cause loss knee joint proprioception contributes towards deterioration postural balance . Maintaining good postural stability essential performing everyday functional activity avoid fall . Exercise training report reduce pain well improve performance functional task patient KOA however compliance exercise challenge due pain , lack motivation traditional nature exercise easily overtax patient . Furthermore , exercise program specifically design patient KOA order address lose knee joint proprioception . Recent study also demonstrate visual feedback exercise enhance benefit exercise training . Therefore , aim propose study implement interactive sensor-based exercise training improve postural balance , gait activity daily live patient KOA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wearable Sensor-based Balance Training Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The exercise intervention procedure base wearable sensor game-based balance-training program ( Exergame ) . Subjects perform progressive balance exercise ankle reach weight shifting , obstacle crossing , ankle trail making task ( i.e . motor-cognitive task ) . Real-time visual/audio lower-extremity joint motion feedback provide use wearable sensor ( LEGSys , Biosensics LLC , Cambridge , MA , USA ) assist encourage subject accurately execute exercise task . The wearable sensor technology also use quantify change balance gait . Changes balance , gait , fear fall , physical activity , pain , quality life parameter assess begin conclusion training program . Subjects perform sensor-based interactive balance training ( computer screen ) , 2 x week , period 6 week . The training consist three balance task show computer screen ( 1. ankle reach task weight shift , 2. obstacle negotiation task , 3. ankle trail make task ( i.e . motor-cognitive task ) intend improve postural stability .</detailed_description>
