	<brief_summary>DASAP-HF observational prospective single arm study . All patient treat accord standard care follow center . The protocol require enrollment consecutive patient center , accord eligibility criterion . All patient must sign Patient Informed Consent ( PIC ) enrollment study . All patient , enrollment phase , follow 24 month . Approximately every 12 month clinical follow-up procedure perform patient . A sleep study do patient 1 month ( 3 month ) enrollment , order evaluate performance algorithm diagnostic tool population ( primary objective ) . During 24 month follow-up period , Adverse Events occur study population collect ( HF hospitalization , all-cause death , ventricular arrhythmia , etc. ) . At end 24 month follow-up , incidence clinical event evaluate well association Respiratory Disturbance Index ( RDI ) value calculate APNEA Scan algorithm ( secondary objective ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart Failure ( HF ) lead cause morbidity mortality develop country major national global health problem involve 2 % overall population 10 % elderly . A remarkably high proportion ( around 50 % ) stable optimally treated patient HF systolic dysfunction experience persistent , moderate-to-severe breathing disorder nighttime e short-term laboratory recording.Sleep Disordered Breathing ( SDB ) associate transient hypoxia increase sympathetic activity . Both factor could worsen Left Ventricular Ejection Function ( LVEF ) increase serious arrhythmia . Diagnosing treat apnea may become relevant issue management HF patient . Prognostic stratification congestive HF important objective patient management . Many prognostic stratification score suggest , however none gain extensive acceptance . Variables use generate stratification score must simple , clinically relevant , readily obtainable . Furthermore , must correlate clinical event , hospitalization , Implant Cardioverter Defibrillator ( ICD ) intervention mortality . ICD intervention know correlate prognosis , thus include among end-points . Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) demonstrate positively affect SA reduce apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) . The recently develop implantable ventilation sensor allow automate detection advance breathe disorder may provide possibility closely track benefit treatment also provide insight pathophysiological mechanism link Central Sleep Apnea ( CSA ) HF . Given automate detection sleep disorder breathing perform limited cohort patient preserve LVEF require pacemaker ( PM ) implantation standard bradycardia indication , one aspect require clarification assessment/validation performance automate detection patient HF . The RDI use assess severity sleep apnea base total number complete cessation ( apnea ) partial obstruction ( hypopnea ) breathe occur per hour sleep . These pause breathe must last 10 second associated decrease oxygenation blood . In general , RDI use classify severity disease ( mild 5-15 , moderate 15-30 , severe great 30 ) . An implanted pacing device respiratory sense function may provide clinically useful diagnostics treatment sleep-related breathing disorder . The purpose study evaluate performance APNEA Scan algorithm patient implanted ICD CRT-D device endow APNEA Scan algorithm . Primary objective study evaluate performance RDI value calculate APNEA Scan algorithm , binary discriminator severe Sleep Apnea ( SA ) detect gold-standard sleep study . Secondary objective study ass incidence clinical event 24 month enrollment investigate association RDI value calculate APNEA Scan algorithm .</detailed_description>
