	<brief_summary>Individuals schizophrenia difficulty function community . No one really know factor determine well patient manage real world . The purpose pilot study try new approach improve potential determinant good community functioning , namely process sound . Specifically , propose examine benefit transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , new tool develop safe non-invasive neurostimulation method , improve process sound . Transcranial direct current stimulation involve place wet sponge electrode head one arm . Electrical current device power 9-volt battery flow one electrode . A small portion current pas skull stimulate brain . This procedure non-invasive painless result increase decrease spontaneous neuronal firing brain . Neurons brain cell send electrochemical message . Its safety beneficial effect mental function demonstrate healthy individual several clinical population . The purpose study determine transcranial direct current stimulation effect process sound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Target Engagement Early Auditory Processing Network Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurocognitive social cognitive deficit increasingly recognize core feature schizophrenia . The severity deficits closely correlate functional impairment patient outcomes population . Current pharmacological treatment address illness domain psychosocial intervention consistently available . Underlying high level cognitive domain basic sensory process deficit auditory visual realm contribute high order dysfunction . Evidence sensory defect readily apparent clinical exam best appreciate use functional image electrophysiological measure . Interventions remediate sensory deficit may lead functional improvement sensory level improvement may cascade high cognitive domain . Deficits auditory processing evidence use EEG base event relate potential ( ERP ) . A robust measure early auditory process deficit schizophrenia use auditory oddball paradigm elicit Mismatch Negativity ( MMN ) . The MMN ERP generate rare deviant signal detect context series standard . The amplitude MMN schizophrenia patient decrease compare healthy control reflect deficit detect novel stimulus . This decreased auditory MMN show closely correlated deficit auditory emotion recognition task subject schizophrenia patient functional outcome . This deficit early auditory processing think secondary region cortical hypoactivity . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive neuromodulation technique target cortical region direct current either increase decrease cortical excitability depend polarity tDCS electrode . The MMN network compose several generator serve process auditory signal , establish auditory memory trace , signal appearance deviant signal . The initial aim propose study determine tDCS stimulation auditory cortex modulate early auditory processing measure MMN response . Our second aim determine effect tDCS stimulation auditory cortex performance measure auditory processing assess tone match task . Aims Hypotheses Aim 1 Determine whether early auditory processing network engage modulate tDCS superior temporal lobe , early generator network maybe locate , assess change auditory mismatch negativity ERP . Hypothesis 1 Active tDCS stimulation superior temporal lobe modulate early auditory processing network result effect measurable amplitude change mismatch negativity ERP compare control sham stimulation . Aim 2 Determine effect tDCS temporal generator early auditory processing network assess tone match task performance measure Hypothesis 2 Active tDCS stimulation temporal generator modulate early auditory processing network result performance change tone-matching task compare sham control stimulation . Study Protocol The study within subject , cross design counterbalance order stimulation condition post-stimulation measurement . All patient receive anodal , cathodal sham stimulation target bilaterally superior temporal region ( unipolarity , dual-site stimulation ) . We directional prediction active stimulation ( anode cathode ) term increase decrease amplitude MMN ERP , expect active stimulation change MMN ERP amplitude . Patients schizophrenia randomly assign one six block stimulation sequence counterbalance order stimulation condition . The goal complete usable data 12 subject , thus 30 subject enrol account screen failures drop-outs . At first visit , subject screen , assess , consent meet selection criterion . They randomize one counterbalance stimulation sequence receive first stimulation session follow EEG assessment tone match task . Subjects return one week visit 2 follow week visit 3 . At visit 2 3 , subject receive tDCS session follow EEG tone match task assessment . All visit separate least 1 week washout effect previous stimulation . Each patient return total 3 stimulation visit .</detailed_description>
