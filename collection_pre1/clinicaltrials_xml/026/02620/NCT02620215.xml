	<brief_summary>About 1 6 delivery KKH induce prostaglandin . Inpatient induction lengthy process especially cervical priming require . Although mechanical method induction labour ( IOL ) establish , use Singapore uncommon . Systematic review compare mechanical method pharmacological surgical IOL show mechanical method similar efficacy low risk profile . As IOL common obstetric procedure , revisit technique warrant . A multi-centre randomise control trial conclude cervical ripening balloon prostaglandin effective complementary method IOL uncomplicated singleton pregnancy , examine effect pain . The investigator propose evaluate adverse event 12 hour CRB 1st prostaglandin insertion , efficiency term singleton IOL Singapore context test acceptability woman Singapore use CRB alternative method induction labour use non-incremental balloon filling regime . Currently , efficient method induction use safely outpatient setting . Through study , investigator hope show major adverse event 12h patient induced CRB , potentially support outpatient IOL CRB reduce hospitalisation medical cost . A non-incremental balloon fill regime decrease time delay may increase patient satisfaction use induction labour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort randomise control trial conduct KK Women 's Children 's Hospital ( KKH ) University Malaya Medical Centre ( UMMC ) . NICE guideline induction labour define uterine hyperstimulation contraction 5 10 min 20 min contraction last 2 min duration . A retrospective study involve prostaglandin induction labour show hyperstimulation occur 5.8 % case . The sample size calculate base 4.8 % reduction hyperstimulation induction labour CRB . At level significance 5 % , 80 % power , 200 patient arm require . Preliminary study Tan TL et al dropout rate 4.6 % . Hence propose sample size 420 . The investigator plan collaborate multi-centre trial University Malaya Medical Centre . In , centre recruit 210 patient study . Randomization participant achieve third party seal envelope allocation . 210 envelope contain CRB allocation another 210 identical envelope contain prostin allocation prepare third party . The 420 envelops shuffle accord computer randomisation code seal labelled randomization allocation number 1 420 . The 210 envelops hand centre 's PI , keep clinical store labour ward together stock CRB prostin . Unfortunately , possible blind allocation investigator patient . The investigator however part observe adverse event , CTGs interpret attend clinician vet team avoid miss abnormal CTG . The patient report contraction pain score satisfaction score validate standard pain satisfaction assessment tool minimise potential bias . The allocation also omit database blind analyst order prevent manipulation . There additional clinic visit labour ward admission require study . The potential patient receive subsidize obstetric care require elective IOL term identify doctor clinical research coordinator subsidize clinic labour ward obstetric subsidized ward , screen accordingly inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . Inclusion criterion : Pregnant woman age 21 - 40 year old , singleton pregnancy , major fetal anomaly , plan induction labour 37+0 week 41+6 week gestation , vaginal delivery appropriate , patient able give inform consent participate trial Exclusion criterion : Spontaneous labour start plan induction , Bishop score &lt; 6 cervical dilatation &gt; =3 cm start induction , confirm rupture membrane , abnormal CTG start induction , caesarean section delivery indicate , scar uterus previous caesarean section , malpresentation labour , patient withdraw consent participate trial . Latex allergy , severe asthma glaucoma .</detailed_description>
