	<brief_summary>Anecdotal report suggest buffer lidocaine epinephrine intraoral injection reduces time onset , result deeply anesthetic effect , without `` sting '' injection low pH . Additional data need establish clinical important outcome peak blood level lidocaine compare non-buffered drug combination . Clinical pilot study propose start series investigation support modify use buffer anesthetic intraoral procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Outcomes Buffered vs. Non-Buffered Lidocaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Compare blood level 30min post injection mandibular block buffer non- buffered 2 % lidocaine 1/100k epinephrine . Assess outcomes ( pain level post-injection , onset anesthesia symptom ) buffer non-buffered oral administration 2 % lidocaine 1/100k epinephrine . Assess possible topical anesthetic property buffer non-buffered oral administration 2 % lidocaine 1/100k epinephrine Hypotheses : No difference peak blood level exist buffer non-buffered intraoral injection 2 % lidocaine 1/100k epinephrine . Injection buffer local anesthetic produce less discomfort subject compare drug low pH . Buffered local anesthetic produce topical anesthetic effect Study Time Frame : 6 month Month One IRB approval . Recruit volunteer subject . Prepare case-books . Months Two-Three Clinical Study Months Four-Five Analyze Lab , QOL data Month Six Prepare Abstracts , Papers Methods : Blinded , Randomized Clinical Design Recruit subject IRB approve consent UNC Target enrollment 24 subject Subjects serve control cross-over AB/BA study design uniform within sequence , uniform within period , balance Sample size justification : Primary interest estimation effect size pilot study . 24 subject sufficient provide data assess whether large study warrant provide estimate sample size calculation large study . Vital sign record : 10 min , 30min interval post-anesthetic clinical sign disappear : target low lip long numb . Randomized subject inject alternatively 4cc buffer 4cc non-buffered oral administration 2 % lidocaine 1/100k epinephrine . SAS use create randomization schedule : The randomization perform first type drug give balance randomization ( half subject buffer ; half non-buffered ) An OMS resident , Dr Phero , administer drug OMS clinic . In week One subject would receive anesthetic block inferior alveolar lingual N ; Halstead Gow-Gates technique . No Buccal N. block . At least week late injection would involve alternate local anesthetic combination . Venous blood sample would draw antecubital fossa 30min post oral injection assay blood lidocaine level Timed Assessment : pre , injection , post-anesthetic Clinical Onset Anesthesia Signs : subject report molar area numbness numb low lip ipsilateral injected side . Assessment pain level injection ; modify Likert-type scale In addition clinic session assessment topical anesthetic effect contralateral low lip 5 drop inject drug place clinically dry low lip mucosa , Outcome yes/no . Data Collection : UNC OMS clinic Venous blood sample ( 10cc ) drawn antecubital fossa 30min post oral injection . Timed assessment pre , injection , post-anesthetic clinical Signs : molar area anesthesia , incisor area anesthesia , numb low lip topical Data Collection/Analysis : Data manage study staff . Data collection form questionnaires clinical data develop use Teleform direct scanning input ACCESS database . Similar form use previous study . All database store password protect School Dentistry server specific group assignment . SAS use database management statistical analysis . Descriptive statistic use verify correct entry range logical check .</detailed_description>
