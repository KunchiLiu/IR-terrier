	<brief_title>Dietary Diversity Associated With Maternal Anemia Key Prenatal Outcomes Ethiopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Nutrient intake , food choice , dietary diversity key determinant nutritional status associate health outcome human being . When people eat variety food , likely meet need wide range essential nutrient . Yet many poor people across globe , dietary diversity low , daily diet dominate one main staple food . Poorly diversify monotonous food , originate plant source typical characteristic diet people low income country , particularly sub-Saharan Africa . Dietary diversity measure number individual food food group consume give time period . Particularly , Individual Dietary Diversity Score ( IDDS ) useful proxy measure nutritional quality individual 's diet reflection nutrient adequacy . It triangulate food-related information contribute towards provide holistic picture food nutrition status individual use simple quick indicator micronutrient adequacy diet . Maternal child under-nutrition consider underlying cause 3â€¢5 million annual death , responsible overall increase disease burden low middle-income country . As child health pregnancy outcomes largely influenced maternal dietary practice , nutritionally deprive population , maternal nutrition identify strong predictor poor pregnancy outcome include low birth weight ( LBW ) , still birth pre-term delivery . Furthermore , nutritional status , also anthropometric , biochemical , behavioral characteristic mother also strongly associate pregnancy pregnancy outcomes . Anemia pregnancy among lead maternal nutritional problem associate number poor pregnancy outcome . Globally , 42 % pregnant woman identify anemic nearly 60 % anemia assume due iron deficiency non-malarias area , 50 % malaria areas. ( 16 ) . The prevalence , complication , severity associate risk anemia among pregnant lactate mother low middle income country alarmingly high . Ethiopia sub-Saharan African country unacceptably high level maternal neonatal mortality rate . The prevalence adverse pregnancy outcome ; low birth weight , preterm still birth country also high . Contrarily , paucity evidence regard problem solution undertake . Only cross-sectional study investigate level determinant maternal anemia prenatal outcome . Given dynamic physiology pregnancy , cross-sectional study ill-equipped address problem occur naturally . Hardly available study also analyze association maternal dietary diversity practice anemia subsequent pregnancy outcomes . There also inconsistency finding study magnitude predictor identify . Therefore ; study examine association maternal dietary diversity practice pregnancy anemia subsequent adverse pregnancy outcome : low birth weight , preterm still birth . Methods : Study design study area . A prospective cohort design employ select , enroll , categorize follow pregnant mother second antenatal care visit end delivery , eight randomly select health center four rural district , Ethiopia . The Zone divide four agro-climatic area mainly due variation altitude . It dominantly characterize moderately cool ( 40 % ) cool ( 34 % ) agro-climatic zone , remain 1/4th account moderately warm ( 20 % ) cold ( 6 % ) temperature zone . Arsi Zone one surplus produce area Ethiopia , food insecure household . Recent study show majority rural population inadequate moderate DD practice le 10 % practice high ( 3,27,28 ) . Sample size Sample size calculate use Open Epi Kelsey statistical software . The following assumption take consideration : 95 % two-sided significance level , 80 % power , one one ratio expose unexposed 23 % anemia among expose ( mother inadequate dietary diversity ) predict 10 % low rate anemia among unexposed mother . This yield total 196 per arm total 392 pregnant woman . Adding allow 10 % drop-out rate study , 216 pregnant woman per category sum 432 woman final sample study calculate . Sampling Procedure Pregnant mother recruit enrolled study second trimester pregnancy gestational age range 24 - 28 week . They also follow time enrollment final end pregnancy delivery document remain maternal fetal outcome . The timing enrollment second trimester pregnancy base previous study Ethiopia show fact rural pregnant mother visit health facility antenatal care lately second third trimester pregnancy . Though formal enrollment study make second visit , relevant obstetric , anthropometric biochemical data medical record mother initiate antenatal visit earlier first trim pregnancy document . It maternal DD score use main criterion recruit , enroll follow mother respective study category . Pregnant mother categorize either adequate dietary diversity `` adequate '' inadequate dietary diversity `` inadequate '' group one one ratio base individual dietary diversity score ( IDDS ) . Mothers IDDS &lt; 4 categorized inadequate 4 - 9 IDDS assign adequate group ( Figure . 1 ) . During analysis ; however , adequate group re-categorized moderate high dietary diversity sub-groups cover wide range IDDS four nine . All classification categorization strictly base recommendation recent FAO 's guideline . Inclusion Exclusion Criteria To select appropriate study subject , criterion like select pregnant woman willing stay study throughout whole course pregnancy visit health center antenatal delivery care service use . Additional criterion use weather pregnant mother live least six month study area , previous know medical , surgical obstetric problem take account inclusion exclusion . Food Consumption ( Dietary intake ) According FAO 's late revise guideline technique method measure household individual dietary diversity , qualitative recall food consume woman previous 24-h period perform two distinct season ( pre-harvest main harvest season , occur commonly August October peak harvest season , November - January ) . A total four 24-hours visit complete mother monthly basis start enrollment delivery . Each woman involve study ask recall dish , snack , food eat period , regardless whether food eaten inside outside compound . The woman also ask spontaneously describe food consumption without probe . It collect spontaneous response prompt sure meal snack forget . Next , detailed list ingredient dish , snack , food mention , collect either person charge preparation directly woman interview . Dietary diversity score Dietary diversity score ( DDS ) define number food group consume period 24h . The diet classified accord nine food group recommend FAO , include : ( 1 ) cereal , root tuber ; ( 2 ) vitamin-A-rich fruit vegetable ; ( 3 ) fruit ; ( 4 ) vegetable ; ( 5 ) legumes nut ; ( 6 ) meat , poultry fish ; ( 7 ) fat oil ; ( 8 ) dairy ; ( 9 ) egg . Other remain item tea , sugar sweet use DDS calculation . Dietary diversity score calculate tally food group consume respond pregnant mother . After respondent recall food beverage consume described , data collector ( midwifes health center ) underline correspond food list appropriate food group write `` 1 '' column next food group least one food group consume . If food list group , write margin discuss later investigator immediate supervisor assign oversee data collection activity . Though happen rarely , mother also ask ingredient food substance diet consume mixed diet consumption find . This settle base agree upon classification select ahead data collection , sometimes consult investigator supervisor . Anthropometry The anthropometric measurement perform use standardized procedure recommend WHO . Pregnant woman weigh near 100 g electronic scale weigh capacity 10 140 kg . Their height measure near mm portable device equip height gauge ( SECA 206 Body meter ) locally calibrate standardize . The mid-upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) leave arm measure near mm non-stretch measuring tape . Women unreliable measurement due physical handicap exclude analysis use anthropometric measure . Hemoglobin : Hemoglobin level take twice , initial antenatal care visit midwives health center document baseline data part standard practice . Hemoglobin level also collect term ( fourth antenatal care visit ) . It measure use HemoCue ( AB Leo Diagnostics , Sweden ) laboratories health center . Before potential use hemoglobin level obtain analysis , make adjustment base WHO recommendation ( 34 ) altitude district . Gestational age : Gestational age estimate midwives health center , last menstrual period ( LMP ) fundal palpation antenatal care also verify delivery . Records gestational age take five time ; baseline ( ANC 1 ) , enrolment ( ANC 2 ) , third four ANC visit delivery . Allocation case control : A mother assign either adequate inadequate group base consistency dietary diversity practice across four visit consider . She group remain fall category three four visit show one shift . Otherwise , consider incomplete eliminate analysis . Potential source control Bias : Anticipating fact major source bias could due key variable like major socio-demographic economic factor intake /compliance iron folic acid supplement . To control , random allocation post enrollment analysis make check difference across study group . Controlling variable also make data analysis . Outcome Ascertainment : The outcome measure include : maternal anemia level , low birth weight , pre-term birth still birth . Maternal anemia pregnancy ascertain hemoglobin level baseline term . Birth weight record midwife immediately birth study health center nearest 10g , . Still birth pre-term birth also ascertain professional birth . Other information , data maternal characteristic age , education , reproductive history morbidity collect . Information household 's composition , expenditures socioeconomic , environmental health indicator also document Data collection Study tool ( questionnaires others ) adopt study pre-tested 5 % similar population actual study conduct . Accordingly , relevant obstetric nutritional data collect use tool twenty four well trained midwife work permanently antenatal care service provision unit respective health center . Over two third ( seventeen ) nurse diploma holder remain first degree health science . All least four year work experience unit . A five day train participant selection process , enrollment , follow-up data collection tool give midwife involve data collection supervision process . In health center select , one supervisor ( usually head health center ) assign oversee data collection . The investigator frequently travel health center enrollment final data collection , least every week facility start data collection final outcome ascertainment completion data collection activity . Prior begin data collection , questionnaire adapt local survey context appropriate translation local language ( Afan Oromo Amharic ) adaptation food list standard questionnaire reflect locally available food . It also agree common meaning translation term use describe key concept . The appropriate food group classification base food classify one food group . Mixed dish dis-aggregated order record individual component respective food group . Eligible participate woman approach midwife verbal consent obtain proper explanation study procedure enrollment follow - . During subsequent visit , relevant data collect data collection guide prepare investigator use data collect midwife health center . Ethical Considerations . The study approve Ethics Committees Addis Ababa University , College Natural Sciences well Regional Health Bureau . A formal official cooperative letter write hierarchal region zonal health office , district health center finally Kebeles ( village ) . Prior undertaking interview , write consent obtain mother . Statistical Analysis . Data entry perform Epi-data statistical software . Data quality maintain quality check data collection entry ( double entry ) cleaning . All statistical analysis carry use SPSS Statistics ( version 20.0 ) . Exploratory data analysis technique use uncover distribution structure study variable identify outlier unusually enter value . Distribution continuous variable test normality use Smirnov - Kolmogrov test . Variables assume normal distribution transform log distribution actual analysis make . Independent 't'-test used test mean difference different dietary diversity group . General linear model Chi-square test Fisher exact test use test independence distribution categorical variable ( demo- graphic characteristic , categorize nutritional variable , dietary intake ) study group .</detailed_description>
