	<detailed_description>The Phase 1 portion study open-label study enrol subject metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma previously receive systemic chemotherapy time treatment pancreatic cancer ( include adjuvant chemotherapy ) , except low dose chemotherapy administer radiosensitizer concomitant radiotherapy determine recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) metronomic 5-FU combination nab-paclitaxel , bevacizumab , leucovorin , oxaliplatin patient metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Subjects enrol cohort 6 subject . There dose escalation . Dose limit toxicity assess cycle 1 . If incidence ≥2 6 subject experience DLT , dose de-escalated next low dose . Based totality data , investigator may advise Sponsor evaluate additional subject dose level . Upon Sponsor agreement , additional subject enrol dose level , DLT evaluation occur ratio ( ≥ 4 12 subject , ≥ 6 18 subject experience DLT , dose de-escalated ) . Approximately 12-24 subject enrol Phase 1 portion study , dependent number dose level examine number subject enrol dose level . Safety continuously evaluate incidence Treatment Emergent Adverse Events ( TEAEs ) Medical Dictionary Drug Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) severity accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) Version 4.03 ( v4.03 ) . The Phase 2 part study determine combination metronomic 5-FU , nab-paclitaxel , bevacizumab , leucovorin , oxaliplatin RP2D define Phase 1 achieves clinically meaningful improvement 1 year survival rate historical control . Approximately 60 subject plan enrol Phase 2 portion study . Subjects may remain treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , physician decision , death . The anticipated duration study ( include Phase 1 , Phase 2 follow-up ) approximately 4 year .
