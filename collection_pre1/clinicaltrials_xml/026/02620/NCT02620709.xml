	<brief_summary>This project community-engaged , randomize control trial hula , indigenous dance form Native Hawaiians ( NH ) , among 250 NHs hypertension live Hawaii Washington State . Investigators compare effect 6-month intervention , call KaHOLO Program , deliver trained peer educator wait-list control condition blood pressure 10-year cardiovascular risk . The intervention comprise hula plus hypertension self-care education program . Investigators also examine mediate effect health behavior , self-regulation , psychosocial , socio-cultural factor blood pressure reduction . The ultimate goal develop test culturally-appropriate , acceptable , effective intervention deliver sustain community setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The KaHOLO Project : Preventing Cardiovascular Disease Native Hawaiians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Native Hawaiians ( NH ) high rate chronic disease , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , diabetes , cancer . Hypertension ( HTN ) , important modifiable risk factor CVD , 70 % high Native Hawaiians ( NH ) Whites . In fact , NH 3-4 time likely develop CVD condition , stroke coronary heart disease , young age . In addition prescribe medication , improvement HTN achieve increased physical activity ( PA ) self-management education ( e.g . stress management , reduce sodium intake , weight-loss , smoke cessation ) . Yet , many commonly prescribed PA , jog use treadmill , difficult NH initiate maintain socioeconomic barrier lack alignment NH prefer mode live cultural value ( i.e . familial interdependence , group-based PA , cultural PA ) . This research study use hula , traditional dance form NH hallmark NH culture , PA basis culturally relevant sustainable CVD prevention program target HTN management . Hula train popular , Hawai ' , across U.S. 784 hālau hula ( hula school ) find States . Using community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) framework , hula-based CVD health intervention strongly endorse Kumu hula ( hula expert guardian hula tradition ) , NH individual , community . Further , hula determine yield metabolic equivalent energy expenditure moderate vigorous intensity PA. Data pilot CBPR randomize control trial ( RCT ) study find 60 minute hula training twice week 12 week reduce systolic blood pressure ( BP ) 7.5 mmHg ( SD=16.5 ) control group , long-term effect mixed study ass CVD risk . Interestingly , pilot intervention also improve social functioning , reduce physical pain , perceive racial discrimination , suggest possible psychosocial socio-cultural mechanism intervention affect BP . In study CBPR guide RCT 250 NH physician-diagnosed HTN Hawai ' Washington State offer . The effect compare 6-month intervention combine hula train brief culturally-tailored HTN self-management education deliver peer educator Kumu hula wait-list control group reduce systolic BP CVD risk score . It also determine mediate effect health behavior ( e.g. , smoke ) , self-regulation , psychosocial ( e.g. , social support ) , socio-cultural factor ( e.g. , perceive racism ) blood pressure reduction . The goal build exist widespread infrastructure hālau hula NH organization deliver sustainable , culturally-preferred CVD prevention program .</detailed_description>
