	<brief_summary>Most physician still use one-size-fits-all approach breast screen woman , regardless personal history , family history genetics ( except BRCA carrier ) recommend annual mammogram start age 40 . Mammograms benefit woman detect cancer early easy treat , perfect . Recent news story discuss potential harm : large number positive result cause stressful recall additional mammogram biopsy . With current screen approach , half woman undergo annual screening ten year least one false positive biopsy . Potentially important cancer diagnosis growth might never come clinical attention leave alone ( call `` overdiagnosis '' ) . This lead unnecessary treatment . Even concern evidence 20 % breast cancer detect today may fall category `` overdiagnosis . '' This proposal compare annual screen risk-based breast cancer screen schedule , base upon woman 's personal risk breast cancer . The investigator design study inclusive , even woman might nervous randomly assign receive particular type care ( procedure typical clinical study ) still able participate choose type care receive . For participant risk-based screening arm , woman receive personal risk assessment include family medical history , breast density measurement test gene ( mutation variation ) link development breast cancer . Women high personal risk develop breast cancer receive frequent screening , woman low personal risk would receive less frequent screening . No woman screen less recommended USPSTF breast cancer screen guideline . If study successful , woman gain realistic understanding personal risk breast cancer well strategy reduce risk , few woman suffer anxiety false positive mammogram unnecessary biopsy . The investigator believe study potential transform breast cancer screen America .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For almost 30 year , annual mammogram woman 40 cornerstone US strategy reduce mortality breast cancer . A number advance understanding breast cancer biology , screen general , lead call revise improve national screening strategy ( Esserman et al. , 2014 ) . In 2009 , US Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) introduce change screen guideline , recommend annual mammogram woman 40-75 replace biennial screen woman age 50-75 , screen 40 's individualized take patient context account , include patient 's value regard specific benefit harm . Despite base thorough review scientific literature , recommendation continue spark debate scientific opinion effectiveness annual screen greatly divide . On one hand radiology obstetrics/gynecology community argue annual mammogram start 40 reduce rate interval cancer . On hand , primary care physician specialist believe annual screening result false-positives unnecessary treatment target approach could result few false-positives less over-diagnosis without increase number interval cancer . In fact estimate half woman receive false-positive recall 10 year annual screen many 20 % breast cancer might overdiagnosed . Since 2009 debate intensify , paralyze system thwart effort change improve screening . The end result woman frustrate confused , stop screen altogether . Despite vastly improve understanding breast cancer risk , criterion use establish woman 's screening recommendation age ( BRCA status know ) , risk model available incorporate personal family history breast disease , endocrine exposure breast density ass breast cancer risk ( Constantino , et al. , 1999 ; Parmigiani , et al. , 1998 ; Tyrer , et al. , 2004 ; Claus , et al. , 2001 ; Ozanne , et al. , 2003 ) . Most recently certain genetic mutation common genetic variant ( single nucleotide polymorphism SNPs ) confirm predictor well ( Darabi , et al. , 2012 ) . Therefore , advance understand breast cancer biology , risk assessment , image enable creation well tools sufficient knowledge replace one-size-fits-all approach screen implement new , personalized model ; one provide recommendation start , stop , often screen depend upon well characterized measure risk . The investigator propose test transformational evidence-based approach breast screen educates woman actual risk , tailor screen recommendation individual . Within Athena Breast Health Network , study compare comprehensive , patient-centered risk-based screen annual screen woman start age 40 . The comprehensive risk assessment base widely accept risk model , Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium model , include endocrine exposure , family history breast density , additional genomic risk factor include rare uncommon major breast cancer susceptibility alleles well common recently validate single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) , cumulatively , contribute significantly woman 's individual risk . The study 's personalize approach recommend age start stop screen well frequency base upon individual risk . Women high risk receive great surveillance low risk low bound USPSTF recommend guideline . In manner , study focus effort likely develop disease . In close collaboration patient advocate , study design 5-year , preference-tolerant , 65,000 patient , randomize controlled trial risk-based versus annual screening . Individuals uncomfortable potential assign particular arm randomize cohort participate self-assigned observational cohort , example pragmatic approach take . Total accrual anticipate 100,000 woman across cohort . A broad group stakeholder participate craft approach , include advocate , payer , entire range medical specialist primary care provider researcher involve breast cancer screen across entire Athena Network , technology partner , Office President University California , policy-making organization . The study hypothesize risk-based screen improvement annual screening safe , less morbid , enable cancer prevention , less stressful readily accept woman result improve understanding personal risk . The Athena Breast Health Network establish across 5 University California medical center develop new , harmonized approach breast cancer prevention , screen treatment . Athena among center North America use technology integrate risk assessment breast screening . The investigator develop cadre `` breast health specialist '' provide woman counsel support around risk prevention . There currently 100,000 register Athena participant , 30,000 new patient per year grow addition Sanford Health , one large rural health network country . The primary research mission Athena address issue require population-based approach translate solution clinical practice . Athena uniquely position address screening controversy provide woman renew confidence decision breast health . Risk-based screen breast cancer exactly advance , evidence-based approach medicine describe NIH FDA 's `` Path Personalized Medicine '' . If hypothesis prove correct , study able establish clear justification use , provide framework widespread implementation benefit woman across country .</detailed_description>
