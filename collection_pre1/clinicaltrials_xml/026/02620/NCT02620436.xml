	<brief_title>Impact Evaluation Maternity Homes Access Zambia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although Zambia 's maternal mortality rate decrease 591 maternal death per 100,000 live birth since 2007 ( 2007 Zambia DHS ) , maternal mortality rate 2014 unacceptably high 398 maternal death per 100,000 live birth . The WHO strongly recommend 'skilled care every birth ' strategy reduce maternal death . However , remain unanswered best deliver high-quality birth postpartum care , particularly rural remote area distance poor transportation service severely restrict access care . The Government Republic Zambia ( GRZ ) commit improve maternal health initiate large cooperative effort aim Ministry Health ( MOH ) , Ministry Community Development , Mother Child Health ( MCDMCH ) , several local international organization . Within context , MHs-temporary lodging locate near health facility skilled care pregnant mother close term-represent potentially useful strategy improve access skilled obstetric care , particularly live farthest health facility . MHs provide pregnant woman option plan ahead travel health facility well labor begin , exist various form since 1950s . However , insufficient evidence effectiveness MHs improve access delivery service improve maternal outcome . While evidence suggest MH utilization correlate improved maternal health outcome ( Gaym , Lori ) , Cochrane review find randomized , quasi-randomized cluster-randomized trial assess effectiveness MHs low resource setting ( van Lonkhuijzen L ) . Rigorous evidence impact MHs maternal perinatal health outcome need . The Maternity Homes Alliance ( MHA ) - partnership GRZ implement partner work collaboration academic institution , evaluation advisor , - seek help woman overcome `` distance problem '' implement MHs , hypothesis offering woman access quality MHs bring woman closer facility-based delivery postpartum care , ultimately improve health outcome . If systematically implement large scale optimal maintenance , management community acceptability utilization , MHs potential remove distance barrier increase access safe delivery woman live farthest health facility . INTERVENTION : This project implement high quality MHs Southern , Eastern Luapula Provinces effort increase access quality intrapartum care among vulnerable woman . Following formative evaluation find MHs could acceptable option improve access safe deliveries rural Zambia , in-country partner , ZCAHRD Africare , implement Core Maternity Home Intervention Model 10 site , total 20 intervention site . OBJECTIVES : The main objective evaluation understand MHs effectively increase access safe delivery , particularly woman live farthest health facility . Findings evaluation use inform program decision regard implementation Maternity Home Model , applicable , advocate programmatic improvement Maternity Home Model take scale beyond district propose project . Primary question : 1 . Does Minimum Core Maternity Home Model increase number facility delivery among mother live 10 km facility compare facility improve maternity home service ? Secondary question : 1 . To degree Minimum Core Maternity Home Model change maternal neonatal health outcome among live 10 km facility compare standard care ? 2 . How awareness perception MHs community locate 10 km health facility change period study ? 3 . How awareness perception HF associate safe delivery HF delivery intention among pregnant woman live community locate 10 km health facility change time ? 4 . What financial impact use MH family woman utilize compare woman utilize ? 5 . How perception quality care differ intervention comparison site ? STUDY DESIGN : This quasi-experimental pre-post design wherein one implementing partner ( BU/ZCAHRD ) use cluster-randomized matched-pair design one implementing partner ( University Michigan/Africare ) utilize non-randomized matched-pair , comparison design . The framework study design show : Table 2 : Quasi-experimental Study Design Evaluate Impact MHs BU/ZCAHRD UMich/Africare Overall R O1 X O2 NR O1 X O2 NR O1 X O2 R O1 _ O2 NR O1 _ O2 NR O1 _ O2 X = Minimum Core Maternity Home ( see ) O = Observations baseline ( O1 , 2016 ) endline ( O2 , 2018 ) intervention ( X ) comparison ( _ ) sit . R = cluster randomize ; NR = randomize . Data pool analysis sample size provide sufficient power separately analyze BU/ZCAHRD UMich/Africare sit . DATA SOURCES : We collect data two main source : 1 . Household Surveys 2 . In-depth Interviews Household Survey ( O1 , O2 ) : A quantitative household survey conduct baseline ( 2016 ) endline ( 2018 ) among woman deliver last 12 month ) live 10 km intervention comparison facility . This approach capture experience utilized facility catchment , facility , access facility delivery , allow u accurately estimate impact MH intervention . In-depth Interviews ( IDI ) ( O1 , O2 ) : IDIs conduct among sample respondent identify household survey gain deeper understand community perception . Content include perception labor delivery practice , barrier access care , knowledge awareness MHs , perception quality maternity home , perception respectful care facility , post-natal care , cost , perception MH ownership . STUDY SITES : Selection Randomization BU/ZCAHRD select 20 site 10 pair match transfer time CEmONC clinic delivery volume . Pairs randomize intervention group control group , yield 10 intervention 10 control site . UMich/Africare purposively select 10 intervention site identify 10 comparison site , match transfer time CEmONC clinic volume . This total 20 intervention 20 comparison site across Alliance . The unit randomization ( BU/ZCAHRD ) matching ( partner ) facility catchment area . SAMPLING STRATEGY : We employ multi-stage random sampling . First , randomly select sample 10 cluster ( village within catchment area 10k facility ) study catchment area probability proportionate population size . Second , list household within select village , randomly order , visit order screen eligibility , continue list nth eligible household village identify . Third , randomly select , applicable , one eligible woman household . FOLLOW UP : At observation point ( O1 O2 ) select new cross-sectional sample use methodology . Therefore , household follow time . DATA QUALITY CONTROL STRATEGY : For quality control , first , enumerator participate 5-day training . Second , enumerator oversee experienced supervisor . These individual review survey quality nightly . Third , supervisor randomly select 5 % subsample household enumerator oversee revisit household re-conduct subset survey question . Data collect supervisor compare data originally collect enumerator check reliability . Fourth , data upload transfer nightly data analysis team Boston ( see Data Entry Storage section ) analysis team review real time consistency quality . DATA ENTRY AND STORAGE : Survey data capture tablet save tablet ' internal memory . Each evening , supervisor review encrypt survey , upload survey nightly secure server administer SurveyCTO . The project team download encrypt data use SurveyCTO Client software , decrypt data use decryption key generate BU/ZCAHRD team . The project staff oversee data entry , management , storage qualitative data . All qualitative data translate English transcribed within 1 month collect . Digital recorder paper copy qualitative note keep locked cabinet fully translate transcribed , point audio file delete note shred . The electronic transcription keep password-protected file . The qualitative transcription contain identify information , study id number . Only study team access identifiable quantitative qualitative data . SAMPLE SIZE : We recruit 2,400 woman survey , 1,200 study group per round study sample 4,800 household plus 50 pilot round . After account cluster sample design ( ICC estimate 0.04 base previous work ) , assume alpha .05 , sample provide u 80 % power detect minimum 10 percentage point difference anticipate impact MH intervention primary outcome facility delivery . For IDIs , estimate sample 360 baseline endline , stop reach saturation predictability full 360 . DATA ANALYSIS : All quantitative analysis conduct SAS version 9.4 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Our quantitative analytic plan threefold , yield descriptive , bivariate multivariate statistic . First , begin descriptive analysis sample household level characteristic respondent level demographic . Second , also look difference outcomes within match pair . Categorical variable compare intervention control group use chi-squared test cell size sufficient Fisher 's exact test cell size small ; continuous variable compare use t-tests normally distribute non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test distribution non-normal . Third , calculate crude adjust logistic linear regression model depend outcome variable . We calculate relative risk odds ratios compare intervention control arm , adjust imbalanced covariates . All qualitative data analyze Nvivo 10 © ( Doncaster , Australia ) . We conduct content analysis in-depth interview transcript . Coding theme identify priori accord outline interview guide . Additional theme include emerge analysis . We triangulate finding quantitative data identify consistency , inconsistency additional theme explore .</detailed_description>
