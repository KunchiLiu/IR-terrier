	<detailed_description>Disturbances phosphate homeostasis strongly associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality . High dietary phosphate intake play central role development disturb phosphate metabolism common person consume typical American diet rich process fast food . An important reason high phosphate content food widespread use phosphate-based food additive food supply . Phosphate additives heavily utilized food manufacturing industry enhance appearance , taste shelf-life process food , account much 50 % total phosphate intake per day . Prior work group suggest high phosphate additive intake serious cardiovascular consequence . We show phosphate excess induces heart disease inflammation experimental study , associate heart disease death independently classic risk factor epidemiology study . Further , show high phosphate additive intake stimulates secretion fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) , phosphate-regulatory hormone directly implicate pathogenesis cardiovascular disease . Together , data strongly suggest high phosphate additive intake promotes cardiovascular disease , important potential implication effort reduce disparity cardiovascular disease . This individual low socioeconomic status limit mean purchase healthy food , result excessive consumption process food rich phosphate additive . Moreover , low income neighborhood disproportionately high prevalence individual chronic kidney disease black individual , group impair ability excrete excess phosphate . Together , data support override hypothesis high phosphate additive intake novel target reduce socioeconomic racial disparity cardiovascular . We test hypothesis detail feeding study 80 individual feed standardized meal low phosphate additive content 10 week . We investigate impact reduce phosphate additive intake change FGF23 level , inflammatory marker vascular function , test effect modification race chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . The result study help determine whether high phosphate additive intake modifiable risk factor disparity cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
