	<brief_summary>We previously show gentle chest pressure technique could use child year old generate around 20 % volume air inhale exhaled single normal breath ( also know tidal volume ) . This show non-invasive method could use provide temporary mean artificial breathing , mean invasive procedure , put breathe tube , could avoid . What result tell u , however , much oxygen get peripheral tissue ( e.g. , arm , leg ) method . In study , want compare two group child . All child breathe tube ; one group gentle chest pressure perform see oxygen saturation maintain 90 % . The group receive chest pressure . We see long take oxygen level group drop 90 % , point , patient ventilate mechanically .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Airway management different pediatric population compare adult mainly due difference respiratory physiology anatomy . The oxygen consumption three time high child adult result high impact oxygen delivery reserve problem ventilation child . During inspiration , vertical dimension chest cavity increase rib margin lift move , cause increase transverse diameter thorax . This generate negative pressure intrapleural space lung chest wall result lung inflation . The rib cage young child pliable . One theoretical way improve efficiency lung inflation small child compliant rib cage apply pressure chest . The intrathoracic pressure increase atmospheric pressure air preferentially flow lung accord pressure gradient . When pressure chest release thorax recoil passively ( `` spring open '' ) , negative intrathoracic pressure generate . This effectively `` suck '' air lung along pressure gradient . Although age-related pliability difference may present , expect significant factor use chest pressure technique successfully . We previously demonstrate application gentle pressure right chest pediatric patient generate 20 % tidal volume achieve mechanical ventilation , regardless whether patient intubate . Chest pressure monitor use force transducer exceed patient 's body weight . Indeed , pressure use considerably less would administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation . There little variation across age range ; age group , observe difference le 1 mL/kg compare overall mean tidal volume . Our study also show gentle chest pressure technique well-tolerated pediatric patient age ( neonate adolescent ) , adverse event encounter , support technique low-risk maneuver . While result encourage , study provide detailed information much peripheral oxygenation ( SpO2 ) achieve gentle chest pressure technique . An editorial accompany publish study support investigation technique , include extent provide ventilation ability provide adequate oxygenation . In study , wish perform technique pediatric patient determine use maintain SpO2 significant length time . For safety purpose , trial do patient whose trachea intubate . OBJECTIVE To determine gentle chest pressure technique use maintain SpO2 90 % significantly longer allow SpO2 desaturate spontaneously . HYPOTHESIS Gentle chest pressure maintain SpO2 90 % significantly longer tissue allow desaturate spontaneously . METHODS After obtain ethic approval , informed consent without assent whenever appropriate ( usually age 6 year ) obtain day ward . Consent obtain research assistant involve clinical care patient . The demographic detail patient , age , weight , height , ASA medical condition record . The patient take operating room , routine monitoring apply . After induction standard general anesthesia technique discretion individual anesthesiologist responsible case , patient 's trachea intubate . The patient ventilate mechanically two minute achieve 100 % peripheral oxygen saturation . During time , patient randomly allocate one two group - intervention control - member study team . Instructions seal envelope indicate whether chest pressure technique use . For patient intervention group , anesthesiologist apply gentle pressure ( exceed patient 's weight ) vertically patient 's right chest . In previous study , calibrate pressure use force transducer ; since , Stollery pediatric anesthesia staff employ technique regular practice well experienced amount force need generate adequate tidal volume . Since pre-defined distance depress chest ( e.g. , 1 2 cm ) difficult use wide range patient weight ( approximately 9-67 kg range previous study ) , study , anesthesiologist apply pressure point resistance encounter release . Upon release pressure , anesthesiologist wait one second . In experience , time take apply downward pressure allow chest recoil last approximately four second , one second pause follow pressure release , create total time 5 second entire maneuver . As , maneuver use achieve 12 breath per minute . Oxygen saturation monitor record continuously . The time take SpO2 level fall 90 % record , point , anesthesiologist restart mechanical ventilation . If SpO2 value fall 90 % time chest pressure technique perform , patient ventilate mechanically immediately already intubate . Patients randomize control group receive care intervention group except chest pressure technique perform . Following mechanical ventilation 100 % SpO2 , surgery proceed normal additional intervention ( i.e. , gentle chest pressure ) anesthesiologist . Peripheral oxygen saturation monitor time , level reach 90 % , time record , anesthesiologist restart mechanical ventilation .</detailed_description>
