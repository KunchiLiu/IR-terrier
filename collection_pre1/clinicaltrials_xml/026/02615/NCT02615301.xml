	<detailed_description>Suboptimal vitamin D status common among human , might negative impact bone health . Fatty fish , include Atlantic salmon , important dietary vitamin D source . However , due considerable change fish feed composition , contribution vitamin D salmon fillet reduce . The aims investigate intake tailor-made salmon affect bone biomarkers , nutritional status ( vitamin D , omega-3 ) , well body composition bone mineral density ( BMD ) . The 122 healthy postmenopausal woman ( median 55 year ) include 12 week intervention study randomize four group : three salmon group ( 150 grams/two times/week ) one tablet group ( 800IU vitamin D 1000 mg Calcium/day ) . The salmon group also receive calcium supplement ( 1000 mg/d ) . The salmon three different vitamin D3/vitamin K1 combination : high D3 + high K1 , low D3 + high K1 , high D3 + low K1 .</detailed_description>
