	<detailed_description>A . APPLICANT INFORMATION Proposed Project Title TeleRehab Patients Post-Stroke Communication Deficits use Mobile Technology Primary Investigator Karen Mallet , M.H.Sc. , M.Ed . SLP ( C ) Speech-Language Pathologist Champlain Regional Stroke Network Ottawa Hospital - Civic Campus 1053 Carling Avenue , Ottawa , ON K1Y 4E9 Co-PI : Dariush Dowlatshahi MD PhD FRCPC Assistant Professor , University Ottawa Scientist , Ottawa Hospital Research Institute Ottawa Hospital Civic Campus C2182b 1053 Carling Ave , Ottawa , ON K1Y 4E9 Primary Research Site Ottawa Hospital Research Institute B . LAY SUMMARY Post-stroke communication deficit ( PSCD ) common symptom patient sustain stroke . These deficit include difficulty produce understand language , motor speech disorder cognitive-communication disorder . It estimate approximately 40 % stroke survivor communication disorder post stroke . Provincially , know 39.8 % mildly disable stroke survivor discharge home without service 13.8 % referred outpatient rehabilitation service 2012/13 . In Champlain Region , overall percentage patient refer outpatient rehabilitation service 4.1 % 2012/13 ( provincial benchmark 12.8 % ) . Meanwhile , 27.9 % patient admitted inpatient rehabilitation . A one month audit Ottawa Hospital Civic Campus ( October 2014 ) reveal 3/39 ( 7.6 % ) patient attend outpatient rehabilitation . The Champlain Region identify gap service regard outpatient and/or community rehabilitation service . That , dedicate outpatient stroke service available Champlain Region Elizabeth Bruyère . There possibility access general outpatient speech language service Montfort Hospital , Queensway Carleton Hospital Perth Hospital . However , outpatient service Renfrew County Eastern Counties . Community Care Access Centers ( CCAC ) another source outpatient rehabilitation . However , service limit keep Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations , recommend client minimum 45 minute per day 3 hour per day , 3 5 day per week base patient 's needs goal . Between 2011 2013 , mean number rehabilitation visit provide Champlain Region CCAC 3.3 5.2 visit [ include follow discipline Physiotherapy ( PT ) , Occupational therapy ( OT ) , Speech Language Pathology ( SLP ) &amp; Social Work ( SW ) ] . Other publically funded/supported service , patient could access service SLPs community service Aphasia Center Ottawa ( fee service ) , University Ottawa Inter-professional Clinic ( Francophones ) private SLPs ( fee service ) . Unfortunately , either cost prohibitive language prohibitive . Patients discharge home require SLP service sometimes place waitlist access service . While others , able access outpatient service variety reason include : patient live great distance rehabilitation facility ( &gt; 30 minute ) ; unable access reliable transportation outpatient service ; patient stamen participate demands/schedule outpatient therapy travel outpatient service . In randomize controlled study , investigator ' objective test value provide mobile platform-based Speech Language Therapy ( SLT ) program patient discharge acute care hospital stroke PSCD await outpatient rehab service versus standard care treatment . The investigator offer iPad-based SLT/standard treatment convenience sample 20 patient post-stroke communication deficit . The primary outcome feasibility ( recruitment rate , adherence rate , retention rate , protocol deviation ) , secondary outcome improvement PSCD . C. OBJECTIVES Research question : Is feasible , practical effective deliver SLT use mobile technology ( iPad ) patient PSCD discharge home/primary residence acute care set ? Rationale PSCD affect 15-40 % patient recovery phase stroke . It limit post-stroke rehabilitation , associate increased disability mortality . While screen identify patient risk PSCD , target treatment always available . Although quality life patient PSCD difficult measure directly , disruption communication likely effect employment status social network suggest impact profound . Patients PSCD great morbidity stroke patient without PSCD . While , , patient post-stroke PSCD functional recovery , residual deficit common . Objective 1 : To test feasibility practicality use mobile technology ( iPad ) deliver SLT patient PSCD discharge HOME/PRIMARY RESIDENCE acute care set Objective 2 : To explore efficacy use mobile technology deliver SLT patient PSCD discharge HOME/PRIMARY RESIDENCE acute care set . D. APPROACH Study population : Patients discharge HOME/PRIMARY RESIDENCE acute care set TOH require communication therapy . According 2013 Ottawa Hospital census , 50 patient per month admit Neurology inpatient service primary diagnosis stroke . Also , ongoing TOH research project use similar design ( iTherapist ) able recruit approximately 3 5 patient per month 6 month period . For study investigator select convenience sample 20 patient 18 month period . Patient identification selection : All patient admit Civic Campus ' Neurology inpatient service diagnosis stroke AND communication deficit ( assessed SLP ) discharge home/primary residence await outpatient SLP service screen research personnel study eligibility . Patients first approach clinical SLP clinician within circle care must give permission speak research personnel . Design Methods : This 18 month randomize controlled trial , recruit post-stroke patient present communication deficit . Intervention : The intervention consist patient randomly assign either standard care receive iPad upon discharge home acute care set . The iPad program specific apps chosen follow list : 1 . Tactus Therapy suite Speech-Language therapy mobile application , include follow module : Language , Category , Conversation Questions . 2 . Speech sound cue iPad Multimedia Speech Pathology 3 . Lingraphica TalkPath Therapy 4 . Search 4 It 5 . This That 6 . Just Saying 7 . Get+Together 8 . RhymieStymie 9 . Morphos 10. iVolution 11 . Blankety-Blank 12 . Chain Thought 13 . Scrabble 14 . Fit brain 15 . Constant Therapy 16 . Boggle iPad 17 . Pop word 18 . Anagram Twist 19 . Word explorer The apps choose specific communication therapy need . These apps monitor remotely SLP . A weekly check-in patient SLP use one following : Skype , Facetime and/or Telephone . Patients randomize one two group 1:1 ratio : Group I ( Treatment Group ) : The study SLP cater specific regimen individual patient base pattern communication deficit . In keep Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations Quality Based Procedures Handbook , study SLP instruct patient use apps least one-hour per day , admit outpatient SLP service maximum 8 week , whichever come first . Throughout telemedicine treatment phase , patient ' progress monitor remotely study SLP Apps/Skype/Facetime/Telephone consultation weekly basis . Patients also instruct record amount time spend use iPad electronic form device . Group 2 ( Control Group ) : Patients send home standard care . Data collection All patient data de-identified . The investigator retain age enrollment , sex , co-morbid medical history ( vascular neurologic condition : MI , CAD , HTN , DM ) , stroke type severity ( NIHSS MRS stroke score ) . The investigator also retain baseline follow-up language test result , total usage time iPad .</detailed_description>
