	<brief_title>Using Attentional Bias Modification Address Trauma Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A relatively new intervention design reduce attention toward ( minimize disengagement ) threat-related information attention bias modification ( ABM ) . ABM novel treatment may address several limitation pose use CPT PE . ABM typically administer via computer , involve brief 20-minute session participant train disengage threat cue naturally attune . ABM address attentional bias similar , though direct , manner CBT use uninterrupted , repetitive exposure fear threat cue word order allow patient interpret fear object situation safe . In particular , ABM 's effectiveness arise intent normalize attentional bias towards away threat intend outcome non-existence bias surround threat cue . ABM address specific bias attention target implicit , sub-cortical process focus perturbed neural circuitry function . It train individual remove attention avoidance threat cue train brain focus equally threat non-threat cue . Therefore , ABM extend work implicate threat-related attention bias anxiety disorder . ABM successfully improve alleviated symptom many disorder , include anxiety disorder , depression , obsessive-compulsive disorder , chronic pain . In addition , ABM successfully implement many population inpatient active duty U.S. military member , Israeli Defense Force soldier , pediatrics , outpatient chronic PTSD . Despite finding , ABM never apply individual current , lifetime , chronic PTSD result sexual assault . Furthermore , study assess use ABM find consistent benefit ABM control group , although effect small ABM treatment group . Authors contend reason ABM control group may experience decrease symptom may use training ( regardless treatment control status ) improve relationship emotional stimulus response require participant order learn exert attentional control . If ABM prove effective address attentional bias associate PTSD associate symptom cluster , unique treatment potential address many limitation concern face rely exclusively CPT PE ; benefit ABM include treatment ( 1 ) relatively simple brief intervention , ( 2 ) may administer electronically remotely patient 's home location beyond typical clinical office , ( 3 ) potential mass-administered . As ABM relatively new treatment many implication utilization , full potential yet explore ; particular , several way ABM may interact empirically support treatment ( ESTs ) CPT PE . Firstly , important recognize CPT PE criticize role require participant immediately `` dwell past '' , frequently result client report distress . This particularly true individual may potentially cop manage trauma reaction use intense avoidance . Thus , prelude integrate individual CPT PE , ABM potential useful transition prior ESTs increase tolerance prepare individual transition integrate provocative type treatment . Starting treatment ABM , introduce individual non-specific trauma content , might serve help people amenable ESTs CPT PE , ultimately increase willingness start stay therapy , decrease attrition , improve retention . Secondly , ABM intervention show several population result least mild reduction symptom . Even mild reduction symptom may open door allow individual make large improvement evidence-based intervention . Studies show individual severe pretreatment trauma-related cognition slightly bad PE outcome individual begin treatment moderate symptom . In apply ABM prior CPT PE , likely mild reduction symptom beforehand may ultimately increase effectiveness efficiency ESTs . Current Study Despite recent focus attention training PTSD , researcher yet examine whether training procedure ABM capable modify attentional bias individual whose disturb impactful trauma sexual assault . Thus , current study , investigator aim examine effect ABM sample woman previously experience adult sexual assault . The aim study three-fold : first foremost , first study kind assess efficacy ABM treatment sample sexual assault victim , investigator examine effect ABM reduce PTSD symptom within trauma type . Secondly , investigator explore PTSD symptom symptom cluster predict treatment outcome attentional variability . Finally , investigator expect quantify document attention variability population , explore whether variability predictive treatment outcome . Regarding study 's aim , investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) ABM treatment control group experience decrease PTSD , depressive , anxiety symptom , great decrease baseline treatment condition . Secondly , investigator hypothesize ( 2 ) relationship heighten symptom cluster express individual attentional bias , individual high avoidance symptom ( Criterion C Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale , CAPS-5 ) demonstrate decrease response time threat cue measure executive function low variability , high hyperarousal symptom ( Criterion E CAPS-5 ) demonstrate increase response time low variability . In contrast , investigator expect high symptom cluster ( hyperarousal avoidance ) demonstrate high variability reaction time , low symptom cluster demonstrate low variability . Finally , investigator hypothesize ( 3 ) increase attention variability associate high PTSD , depressive , anxiety symptom , great change attention variability across study associate great improvement PTSD , depressive , anxiety symptom . More specifically , investigator hypothesize result treatment , participant greatest decrease variability course treatment high hyperarousal and/or avoidance low symptom cluster .</detailed_description>
