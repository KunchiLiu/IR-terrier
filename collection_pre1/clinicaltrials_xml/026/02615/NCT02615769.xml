	<brief_title>Effect Attendance Including Focused Information Spirometry Preventive Health Checks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Lung diseases among frequent serious ailment Denmark . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) fourth frequent cause death represent significant burden health care system , patient relative . The National Board Health Denmark recommend spirometry individual 35 year present least one respiratory symptom ( dyspnea , cough , wheeze sputum production ) risk factor ( prior current smoking relevant occupational exposure ) order facilitate early detection COPD . However approximately 200,000 citizen COPD remain undiagnosed unknown health care system . Preventive health check include spirometry use detect lung disease earlier . In Danish municipality , Check Health Preventive Programme ( CHPP ) initiate , offer preventive health check 30 49 year-old citizen . This health promotion program provide unique opportunity evaluate single component preventive health check real-life setting . Only previous study include spirometry preventive health check . Over time attendance preventive health check decrease present response rate approximately 50 % . Little known initiative influence attendance rate accord preventive health check . The aim study examine whether focused information spirometry invitation material influence attendance preventive health check . The investigator hypothesize spirometry part preventive health check increase attendance CHPP 53 % 58 % increase among prior current smoker . Materiel/Methods : Check health preventive program ( CHPP ) : The present study embed fourth year mention CHPP . In CHPP , citizens live municipality Randers age 30-49 year per 1st January 2012 identify Danish Civil Registration System . CHPP house-hold cluster randomize control trial offer preventive health check 30 49 year old citizen Danish municipality year 2012 2017 ( n= 26,216 ) . The citizen randomize household 5 group equal size , correspond specific year would invite health check . Invitations prefix appointment health check information health check dispatch continuously Setting : The health check subsequent health behavioral course perform local health care center . The subsequent health interview take place participant general practitioner . The health check conduct health professional experience measurement procedure well risk communication ensure standardization quality . The health check : Prior health check participant ask answer web-based questionnaire regard physical activity , self-rated health , mental health , smoke alcohol . The clinical examination include follow measure : biochemical ( total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) ) , systolic diastolic blood pressure , bodyweight , height , spirometry Aastrands submaximal bike-test ( cardiorespiratory fitness ) . At end health check , result present profile pamphlet include recommendation follow accord risk-profile . Execution health check standardize write protocol adherence check continuously . Questionnaire : Based questionnaire data follow categorical variable describe attendee : - Age divide four group ; 30-35 , 36-40 , 41-45 46-50 - Smoking status classify smoker , ex-smoker , never smoker supply information pack year . - Airway symptom ( dyspnoea , wheeze cough ) last four week divide - All time - Most time - Now - Rarely - Not The present study : This randomize controlled trial attendance preventive health check . From November 2015 November 2016 , 4,356 CHPP-citizens randomize either intervention control present trial : The intervention group receive invitation highlight value spirometry part health check . The invitation make collaboration Danish Lung Association test focus group invitation dispatch . The control group receive standard invitation . Primary outcome measure effect attendance . Secondary outcome percentage participant abnormal spirometry assess preventive health check . The characteristic 2 group describe accord sex , age , smoke history , spirometry value lung symptom . The intervention , outcome group assignment trial reveal invitation citizen . Randomization handle independent statistician . Sample size : The sample size estimate 4,356 participant total calculated basis follow assumption : 1:1 randomization , two-sided significance level 0.05 , power 0.9 , intracluster correlation coefficient 0.01 average 1.5 citizen household , calculate design effect 1.05 . Calculations base objective able detect difference 5 % effect size attendance . The investigator determine 5 % difference clinically meaningful base expert opinion criteria employ research . The intracluster correlation coefficient include reflect possible cluster effect general practitioner ( n = 46 ) , seldom great 0.01 primary care setting . Statistic analysis plan : -The main outcome Effect intervention attendance estimate difference proportion citizen attend health check group . Crude adjust estimate difference proportion base binominal regression . Also estimate compare estimate base propensity score . Furthermore , descriptive analysis attendees non-attendees perform regard sex , age , smoke history , self-reported lung symptom spirometry measurement . The analysis follow intention treat principle . For endpoint , number percentage individual experience endpoint present , randomisation group . Binominal regression use estimate difference proportion two group , 95 % confidence interval , compare intervention group comparison group . The baseline measure outcome include covariate model . If distribution outcome skew , log transformation use . -Analysis baseline characteristic For descriptive part study , bivariate multivariate analysis perform . Continuous variable e.g . height weight present mean Â± standard deviation , unless variable highly skewed distribution , case , median , 25th 75th percentile present . For categorical variable , e.g . smoking status , civil status , sex , number percentage individual within category present absolute number relative ( % ) frequency . Anova use compare mean change mean numerical variable ; Chi2-test use compare proportion categorical variable . Categorical outcome analyse logistic regression . The statistical significance level set p &lt; 0.05 . Statistical analysis perform use STATA 14.0 software . Prevention miss data : The primary trial analysis use Intention To Treat ( ITT ) population , include participant group randomise , regardless amount intervention actually receive . The exclusion criterion terminal illness report general practitioner . To prevent attendee refuse participate , household invite together two reminder send . Furthermore , appointment schedule outside work hour . Finally , unique opportunity use Danish register population-based health care database information non-attendees , describe . Treatment miss data : - Missing value due incomplete clinical measurement questionnaires Records miss data due incomplete questionnaire incomplete spirometry measurement exclude . Sensitivity analysis perform consider data miss random random . Afterwards complete case analysis perform . - Missing value non-attendees As clinical measurement answer questionnaire non-attendees , data obtain Danish national register . Sensitivity analysis perform consider data miss random random . Afterwards complete case analysis perform . - Non-attendees described follow parameter : - Sociodemographic : Education level , sex , age , ethnicity civil status 2016 use Danish Civil Registration System ( CRS ) - Socioeconomics : income transfer payment 2016 use Danish Civil Registration System ( CRS ) . - Contacts general practitioner 2014-16 use reimbursement general practitioner Danish National Health Service Register . - Prescriptions respiratory medicine 2014-16 use information redeem medication Danish National Prescription Register use ATC group R03 1995-2013 . We categorize drug rescue drug airway symptom e.g . SABA / SAMA chronic drug airway symptom e.g . SABA/ SAMA , LABA/LAMA , leukotriene inhibitor , theophylline inhaled corticosteroid . Hypothesis : The result present study expect contribute important knowledge value information spirometry invitation health check measure different level attendance - described . Legal ethical aspect : The study present The Scientific Ethics Committee consider routine data thus ethical approval need trial . The study comply declaration Helsinki accord Danish Health Law participant provide write informed consent data use research . Approval The Danish Data Protection Agency obtain ( 2014-54-0704 ) .</detailed_description>
