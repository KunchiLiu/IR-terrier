	<detailed_description>The investigator propose obtain volumetric flow data 10 hand patient Raynaud 's disorder scleroderma UIC rheumatology clinic compare result previously establish volumetric flow data non-Raynaud 's patient . Through analysis , invstigators able good understand correlate subjective objective measure disease presentation progression . Collection cross sectional data allow u good address follow question Is possible precisely diagnose patient Raynaud 's disorder base NOVA analysis well clinical finding Is possible stratify patient Raynaud 's disorder category may allow : . Prediction disease course prognosis ii . Prediction response specific treatment modality ( vasodilator vs anti-coagulation v surgical chemical denervation ) The investigator propose collect measurement disease severity well functional assessment patient Raynaud 's scleroderma order address follow question c. Does NOVA flow volume data correlate measure Raynaud 's scleroderma disease severity index d. Does NOVA flow volume data correlate OT assessment hand functionality .</detailed_description>
