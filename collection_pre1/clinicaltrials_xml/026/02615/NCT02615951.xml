	<brief_summary>Recently , show B cell could also regulatory function secretion interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) . They call B regulatory cell ( Breg ) . In mouse model commonly use rheumatoid arthritis , collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) , transfer Breg help prevent development CIA cure establish arthritis . The investigator recently show Breg decrease patient RA compare control rate Breg inversely correlate disease activity autoantibody . These result thus suggest lack IL-10 secretion B cell play important role pathophysiology RA . Nevertheless , human , Breg remain poorly understood . The main objective project well characterize B capable produce IL-10 subject RA control .

	<detailed_description>Rational : Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , common inflammatory joint disease , often associate irreversible joint destruction involve prognosis patient . If treatment stabilize disease available , research continue try permanently cure disease . It well establish B cell pathogenic role RA . More recently , show B cell could also regulatory function secretion interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) . They call B regulatory cell ( Breg ) . In mouse model commonly use rheumatoid arthritis , collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) , transfer Breg help prevent development CIA cure establish arthritis . The investigator recently show Breg decrease patient RA compare control rate Breg inversely correlate disease activity autoantibody level . These result thus suggest lack IL-10 secretion B cell play important role pathophysiology RA . Nevertheless , human , Breg remain poorly understood . The project 's main objective good characterize B capable produce IL-10 subject RA control . Understanding induces secretion IL-10 B could allow consider new therapeutic approach autoimmune disease , include RA . Objectives : Principal : To identify nutrient transporter chemokine receptor differentially express Breg B cell patient RA . Secondary : - To identify gene surface protein differentially express Breg B Lymphocytes ( BL ) patient RA . - To identify nutrient transporter , chemokine receptor , gene surface protein differentially express Breg BL healthy subject . - To compare expression nutrient transporter , chemokine receptor , gene surface protein Breg Breg control subject RA . Methods : Design : Cross-sectional study involve bicentric rheumatology service Montpellier Nîmes recruitment ; research team Translational IGMM Nîmes immunology laboratory biological analyzes . Population : - RA : patient meet criteria ACR ( American College Rheumatology ) -EULAR ( European League Against Rheumatism ) 2010 , naïve biotherapy corticosteroid less 10 mg / day , stable least week . - Controls : match age sex RA patient , systemic disease . Endpoints - Main : average flow cytometry fluorescence intensity nutrient carrier percentage BL express different chemokine receptor - Secondary : transcriptome analysis proteomics surface cytometric confirmation protein expression RNA proteins identify . Number subject : 50 control 50 RA patient ( 10 3 method comparison Breg / B IL10- 10 two stage validation ) . Each patient visit . The expected study duration 2 year . Statistical analysis : Comparing ratio B + IL-10 / IL-10-B RA patient control Student Mann-Whitney test . Expected Results Prospects : This project allow u good define understand Breg patient RA control . If investigator find specific extracellular marker Breg , simplify study cell . Understanding allow BL become regulator explain lack IL-10 BL RA could open new therapeutic perspective .</detailed_description>
