	<brief_title>RELAX : A Mobile Application Suite Targeting Obesity Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity stress highly comorbid increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Stress associate disinhibited eating , junk food consumption low consumption produce whole grain . Both stress stress-induced eating associate obesity also predict bad outcome lifestyle intervention . Stress stress-induced eating target intervention maximize weight loss ; however , make intensive intervention . Technology could leverage reduce intervention burden . The purpose proposal develop test feasibility proof-of-concept RELAX Application Suite ( AS ) , mobile- , cloud- web-based companion lifestyle intervention address stress . RELAX-AS design reduce clinical visit time identify clinician patient 's behavior stress pattern account great deviation energy balance . Investigators create app diet exercise self-monitoring . The RELAX-AS build upon previous work create comprehensive weight loss stress reduction application suite . RELAX-AS include RELAX-app RELAX-web . RELAX-app patient-facing mobile application link Microsoft Health Vault , cloud-based platform allow secure access health data online . RELAX-app include self-monitoring ( diet , exercise , stress , stress-induced eating ) ; automate feedback via easy-to-interpret visual display feedback report amount , timing , context , relationship target behavior ; self-guided stress management feature prompt stress rating elevate . To minimize burden , investigator incorporate barcode scanner diet recording , GPS exercise tracking , visual analogue scale stress rating , provide brief stress reduction strategy . RELAX-web web-based application clinician access patient 's information form easily digestible visual display feedback report increase efficiency counsel . In traditional counseling much time spend review paper self-monitoring record solicit information patient factor impact adherence ( e.g. , stress stress eat ) . The purpose RELAX-web reduce clinic time need deliver care . The goal use RELAX-AS create intervention delivery model reduces weight stress . The investigator propose 3-year study develop test usability , feasibility , acceptability . This work preparation 2-arm efficacy trial compare RELAX-AS brief lifestyle intervention brief lifestyle intervention alone weight , stress , stress eating .</detailed_description>
