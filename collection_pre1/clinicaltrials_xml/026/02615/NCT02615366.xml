Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) commonly use drug many medical setting reduce excessive bleeding ; however , drug standard practice breast surgery . The aim study determine TXA superior placebo reduce bleed complication breast surgery , include reduction mammaplasty , mastectomy without immediate tissue expander implant-based reconstruction , oncoplastic breast surgery . This study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . Patients undergoing procedure randomly allocate receive either TXA placebo .

	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid Bleeding Breast Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Aberrant bleeding important consideration breast surgery , involve large resection soft tissue breast . Hematomas and/or seromas common complication procedure , lead complication , flap necrosis . Seromas , perhaps common complication , document occur rate high 85 % certain breast procedure . Hematoma rate typically low seroma , range 1 % 2 % mastectomy procedures 5 % 8 % reduction mammaplasty . These bleed complication pose obvious risk patient safety , management result significant cost patient healthcare alike . Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) , also know brand name Cyklokapron® Pfizer™ , lysine analogue use prevent and/or treat bleed competitively block activation plasminogen plasmin , thereby prevent plasmin bind blood clot . Tranexamic acid use safely several medical surgical setting , cone biopsy , epistaxis hyphaema control , dental surgery . This antifibrinolytic medication commonly use many surgical procedure , namely cardiac orthopedic surgery , purpose prevent blood loss . TXA demonstrate effectively reduce perioperative blood loss transfusion rate many different surgical procedure , cardiac , urology , gynecology , orthopedic surgery , without significant safety concern . Despite finding , clear paucity study TXA breast surgery . There currently study explore perioperative TXA use breast reduction , one study breast surgery overall . This study Oertli et al . look use TXA mastectomy lumpectomy axial dissection , randomize placebo-controlled trial ( RCT ) . Seroma rate show reduce 10 % reduction TXA versus placebo . However , due low power study , Oertli et al . unable determine statistical significance . Purpose : The purpose study determine perioperative administration tranexamic acid ( TXA ) superior placebo minimize bleeding complication ( determine : hematoma/seroma incidence breast , re-operation and/or additional procedure , blood transfusion volume , drainage volume ( Jackson-Pratt drain percutaneous drainage ) , number day spend hospital ) breast surgery ( Reduction mammaplasty , mastectomy without immediate tissue expander implant-based reconstruction , oncoplastic breast surgery ) . Conterminous objective , investigator also intend study safety tranexamic acid use perioperatively procedures record adverse effect occur time surgery throughout follow-up period . The study randomize prospectively observe two patient population undergo one procedure : one group receive preoperative subsequent post-operative 1g dos tranexamic acid , receive placebo ( normal saline ) . These two group observe base specific property complication surgery . Finally , determine perioperative TXA use cost-effective placebo set breast surgery . Information health care utilization collect prospectively group provide cost analysis tranexamic acid . The following hypothesis test : 1 . Perioperative TXA use superior placebo reduce bleed complication ( ie . hematoma , seroma , excessive blood loss ) surgical donor site . 2 . Perioperative TXA safe use patient population . Study Design The present study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . This RCT follow CONSORT statement . Conterminous RCT , data treatment cost ( hospital patient cost ) record . The study last approximately two year . Case Report Forms fill follow-up period . Follow-up occur 2 week , 6 week , 12 week postoperatively . Cost-analysis intervention also perform . Sample Size : Based publish data , incidence combine hematoma/seroma endpoint expect range 6 10 % reduction patient 16-87 % mastectomy patient . Since investigator expect equal number type patient , investigator anticipate overall event rate placebo arm range 11-47 % . Taking midpoint , investigator anticipate placebo arm event rate 29 % . The investigator would consider 30 % relative reduction ( i.e. , absolute difference 9 % ) minimal clinically important difference would , demonstrate , change practice . To detect difference 80 % power , investigator require 385 patient per arm use two-sided test 5 % level significance To account attrition 15 patient per arm ( &lt; 5 % ) , investigator aim 400 patient per group . Data Analysis : The unit analysis individual patient outcome . Baseline characteristic compare study arm use descriptive statistic ( frequency proportion categorical variable , mean standard deviation continuous variable normal distribution median inter-quartile range variable skew distribution ) . The investigator ' primary outcome , incidence hematoma and/or seroma , analyze use chi-square test continuity correction . The difference arm describe use relative risk 95 % confidence interval . The overall rate group also report . Secondary outcome analyze use chi-square test ( dichotomous outcome ) Wilcoxon test ( drainage volume , transfusion volume , day hospital ) . Drainage transfusion volume , well number day hospital , summarize median interquartile range . All data analysis carry statistician Ottawa Hospital Research Institute .</detailed_description>
