	<brief_summary>Background Balance impairment key factor contribute fall old adult . Conceptually , clinician may able prescribe target exercise specific impairment identify . Objective Our objective use model balance subsystems identify balance impairment demonstrate effectiveness target ( match ) exercise improve balance reduce fall risk community-dwelling older adult . The investigator use Balance Evaluation System Test ( BESTest ) model categorize balance 6 subsystem . Design Randomized , partially blind , pretest-post-test clinical trial consist 2 Phases : 1 . A comparison impairment-matched exercise control , 2 . A comparison impairment-matched mismatch exercise . Setting Senior independent living community . Participants Adult volunteer ( n = 40 ; age 74-94 ) recruit sample convenience meet criterion . Participants ( n = 20 ) identify impairment biomechanical ( BC ) constraint subsystem participant ( n = 20 ) impairment anticipatory postural adjustment ( APA ) subsystem enrol randomized 2 subgroup ( match control/delayed mismatch ; n = 10 subgroup ) . Intervention Phase 1 : Participants match subgroup receive 6-week exercise program match impaired subsystem mismatch subgroup serve control . Phase 2 : Following delay , participant mismatch group receive 6-week exercise program mismatch impairment . Measurements Primary outcome variable score target subsystem ( BC , APA ) , BESTest total , Berg Balance Scale , fear fall measure . Quality life secondary outcome . Outcome data collect tester blind pretest score group allocation . Results The matched exercise subgroup demonstrate statistical clinical improvement outcome variable compare control ; show great improvement balance impairment compare mismatch subgroup , fall risk reduction . Limitations The therapist administer pretest knew subgroup assignment implement exercise . Conclusions Results provide preliminary evidence use balance assessment model identify impairment BC APA subsystems prescribe target exercise reduces balance impairment old adult may warrant future study .</brief_summary>
