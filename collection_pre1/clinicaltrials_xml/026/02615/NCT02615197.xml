	<brief_title>Effectiveness PTSD Treatment For Suicidal Multi-Diagnostic Clients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although several evidence-based treatment ( EBTs ) post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) find effective research community setting , individual PTSD acutely suicidal , self-injuring , and/or severe comorbid disorder typically exclude treatment . The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Prolonged Exposure ( DBT PE ) protocol show effective treat PTSD among suicidal , self-injuring , multi-diagnostic individual receive Dialectical Behavior Therapy ( DBT ) research setting . The present project two primary aim : ( 1 ) examine effectiveness multi-component implementation strategy improve adoption adherence DBT PE protocol , ( 2 ) evaluate feasibility , acceptability , effectiveness DBT PE protocol sample individual receive DBT public mental health agency . The project conduct collaboration Philadelphia 's Department Behavioral Health Intellectual disAbility Services ( DBHIDS ) . This study use hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation design simultaneously test clinical effectiveness DBT + DBT PE evaluate adaptive , multi-component implementation strategy . The effectiveness trial use quasi-experimental , control design evaluate outcome among DBT client PTSD versus receive DBT PE protocol outcome benchmarked obtain research setting . Clinical effectiveness outcome include measure PTSD , suicidality , global symptom severity , quality life assess four timepoints ( baseline , 4 , 8 , 12 month ) use blind independent evaluator . The initial implementation strategy include implementation team , online training , distribution treatment manual , in-person workshop , team-based clinical consultation , audit feedback session content . The implementation strategy adapt need project use Plan-Do-Study-Act quality improvement method . Implementation outcomes include feasibility , acceptability , adoption , fidelity , penetration , sustainability DBT PE protocol assess via clinician survey 8 timepoints 2 year ( baseline , pre-training , post-training , 4 , 8 , 12-months initial training active implementation , 6 12 month follow-up implementation complete ) . Both effectiveness implementation outcome assess use mixed method , include quantitative evaluation ( e.g. , intent-to-treat analysis across multiple time point ) qualitative evaluation ( e.g. , surveys interview client , clinician , agency administrator ) . Four public mental health agency exist DBT program recruit participation . It estimate yield sample 25 clinician enroll maximum 3 client effectiveness trial ( n=75 client total ) . The project also engage advisory board stakeholder DBHIDS system .</detailed_description>
