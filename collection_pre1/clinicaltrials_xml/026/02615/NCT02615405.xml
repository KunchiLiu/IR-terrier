	<brief_title>Phospholipid Hypothesis Depression : From Molecular Biology , Neuroimaging Behaviour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There several important question answer regard phospholipid polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) hypothesis depression . Firstly , although case-control study reveal depressive patient low level omega-3 PUFAs , abnormal finding individual PUFA docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) arachidonic acid ( AA ) consistent . Secondly , deficit n-3 PUFAs relate metabolic enzyme . However , association study polymorphisms PUFA-metabolism related gene depression limit . Thirdly , active component antidepressant effect n-3 PUFAs still debate . Fourthly , molecular mechanism n-3 PUFAs ' antidepressant effect yet elucidate human brain functional neuroimaging cellular model . This 3-year proposal divide 2 clinical study . In study 1 , investigator aim test clinical biological effect n-3 PUFAs ( EPA : 3.5 g/d DHA : 1.75 g/d versus placebo : high oleic oil ) depressive symptom 12-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial patient drug-free MDD . In study 2 , investigator measure biological neuroimaging marker investigate biological mechanism EPA ( 3.5 g/d ) versus DHA ( 1.75 g/d ) 12-week , double-blind , randomized-controlled trial patient drug-free major depression disorder ( MDD ) .</detailed_description>
