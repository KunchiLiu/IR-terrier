	<criteria>All patient : Aged ≥ 18 year Female MSK histologically confirm primary invasive breast carcinoma Pathologically confirm HER2positive breast cancer Treated adjuvant trastuzumab ( either alone combination antiHER2 agent ) ≥ 2 year since completion target chemotherapy without evidence disease Willing able comply requirement protocol Patients cardiotoxicity ( TOX ) group must meet following criterion : Development treatment associate cardiotoxicity trastuzumab therapy , define absolute decrease baseline LVEF ≥ 10 % , LVEF 55 % . No clinical sign symptom heart failure ( NYHA class III IV ) time cardiotoxicity . Note : NYHA Class III symptom include marked limitation physical activity . Less ordinary activity cause fatigue , palpitation , dyspnea , anginal pain . NYHA Class IV symptom include inability carry physical activity without discomfort . Symptoms heart failure anginal syndrome may present rest , physical activity undertaken , discomfort increase . Patients cardiotoxicity ( NOTOX ) group must meet following criterion : Maximum absolute decrease LVEF ≤ 5 % baseline trastuzumab therapy . Echocardiogram LVEF assessment perform baseline ( prior initiation trastuzumab therapy ) least two timepoints trastuzumab therapy . LVEF ≥ 55 % echocardiogram assessment trastuzumab therapy . No clinical sign symptom heart failure ( NYHA class III IV ) trastuzumab treatment . Note : NYHA Class III symptom include marked limitation physical activity . Less ordinary activity cause fatigue , palpitation , dyspnea , anginal pain . NYHA Class IV symptom include inability carry physical activity without discomfort . Symptoms heart failure anginal syndrome may present rest , physical activity undertaken , discomfort increase . Participants healthy control group must meet following criterion : Aged ≥ 40 year Female No history cancer exception localize basal and/or squamous cell carcinoma skin No prior history know cardiac disease ( e.g . ischemic heart disease , heart failure , cardiomyopathy , valvular heart disease [ moderate severe ] , significant arrhythmia ) . Willing able comply requirement protocol Inability provide inform consent Presence metastatic disease Treatment additional cardiotoxic therapy secondary malignant neoplasm , treatment additional cardiotoxic therapy breast cancer recurrence since primary breast cancer diagnosis [ Note : Patients diagnose second primary malignancy exclude participation study , unless meet exclusion criterion . ] Subjects must follow absolute contraindication cardiopulmonary exercise testing : ( ) acute myocardial infarction ( within 35 day plan study procedure ) , ( b ) unstable angina , ( c ) uncontrolled arrhythmias causing symptom hemodynamic compromise , ( ) symptomatic severe aortic stenosis , ( e ) recurrent syncope , ( f ) active endocarditis , ( g ) acute myocarditis pericarditis , ( h ) uncontrolled heart failure , ( ) acute pulmonary embolus pulmonary infarction , ( within 3 month plan study procedure ) , ( j ) thrombosis low extremity , ( k ) suspect dissect aneurysm , ( l ) uncontrolled asthma , ( ) pulmonary edema ( within 3 month plan study procedure ) , ( n ) room air desaturation rest ≤85 % , ( ) respiratory failure , ( p ) acute noncardiopulmonary disorder may affect exercise performance aggravate exercise ( i.e. , infection , renal failure , thyrotoxicosis ) , ( q ) mental impairment lead inability cooperate .</criteria>
