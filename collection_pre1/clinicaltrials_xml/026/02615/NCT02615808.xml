	<brief_summary>Hospitalized child respiratory disease commonly monitor continuous pulse oximetry heart rate-respiratory rate monitor . These data stream generate &gt; 4,000 unique data point patient-day , yet tiny fraction use inform care decision . Failure adequately summarize large amount data clinician may result suboptimal care clinician may miss important data signal may under- over-react individual data point . In child hospitalize respiratory disease need supplemental oxygen , number care decision , currently make without adequate data , could inform intelligent data visualization tool . This study employ user-centered design develop data display inform nurse ' respiratory therapist ' decision-making supplemental oxygen delivery . The investigator evaluate effectiveness display clinical care patient two common respiratory conditionsâ€”infants bronchiolitis admit general pediatrics ward preterm infant require supplemental oxygen care neonatal intensive care unit . By reduce patient 's time supplemental oxygen improve time optimal oxygen saturation , work potential lead breakthrough innovation improve outcomes value .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study evaluate effectiveness use user-centered design data display clinical care patient admit Cincinnati Children 's Hospital respiratory illnesses two clinical setting . In general pediatric floor investigator evaluate effectiveness user-centered design data display safe efficient wean oxygen general pediatric patient hospitalize bronchiolitis . In NICU investigator evaluate effectiveness user-centered design data display accurate target oxygen saturation level among premature infant . The investigator address aim conduct parallel study Cincinnati Children 's Hospital hospital medicine ( HM ) unit NICU compare data visualization application standard care . The investigator examine intervention effectiveness use adaptation quasi-experimental , equivalent time series design randomization intervention control period . The data visualization apply unit level directly affect nurse patient care unit .</detailed_description>
