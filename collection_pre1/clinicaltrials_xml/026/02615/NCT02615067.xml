	<brief_summary>99mTc-MIP-1404 radioactive diagnostic imaging agent indicate image men newly diagnose prostate cancer whose biopsy indicate histopathologic Gleason Score ≤ 3+4 severity candidate active surveillance undergo voluntary radical prostatectomy ( RP ) [ Cohort A ] routine prostate biopsy [ Cohort B ] . This Phase 3 study design evaluate specificity sensitivity 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT image correctly identify subject previously unknown clinically significant prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT Imaging Men With Biopsy Proven Low-Grade Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , multi-reader , open-label trial , compare 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT image men diagnostic trans-rectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) guide biopsy histopathologic find Gleason score ≤3+4 candidate active surveillance undergoing routine biopsy voluntary RP without pelvic lymph node dissection ( PLND ) . This study evaluate sensitivity specificity 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT image assessment correctly identify subject previously unknown clinically significant prostate cancer two cohort : ( 1 ) Low grade prostate cancer elect undergo RP [ Cohort A ] ; ( 2 ) low risk ( VLR ) prostate cancer per 2016 NCCN Guidelines schedule undergo routine prostate biopsy [ Cohort B ] . Subjects receive single dose 99mTc-MIP-1404 Injection ( study drug ) follow whole body planar SPECT/CT ( pelvic ) image 3-6 hour injection . In accordance standard care procedure , subject undergo either voluntary RP [ Cohort A ] prostate biopsy [ Cohort B ] within 42 day study drug dose . 99mTc-MIP-1404 image data collect central image core laboratory evaluate visible uptake within prostate gland . These finding compare central histopathology truth standard . The central imaging core lab independent reader SPECT/CT scan blind clinical data , include pathology result . Likewise , central pathologist remain blinded clinical data , include image result .</detailed_description>
