	<brief_title>Mid-Atlantic Research Group Single-Operator Cholangioscopic Assessment Biliary Strictures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biliary stricture absence mass clinical challenge , current accept mean sample provide suboptimal accuracy . Both biliary brushing cytology fluoroscopically-directed biopsy produce highly-variable result . Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration also employ variable result . An additional modality , use single-operator cholangioscope endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) obtain cholangioscopically-directed biopsy offer promise increase yield sampling . Initial observational study show improved diagnostic yield , technique test randomized , medical effectiveness study well characterize actual clinical impact . We aim compare technique biopsy-on-biopsy derive sampling via single-operator cholangioscopy standard fluoroscopically-directed biopsy brushing pilot study . We also aim perform medical effectiveness study early use single-operator cholangioscopically ( SOC ) evaluation undiagnosed biliary stricture .</detailed_description>
