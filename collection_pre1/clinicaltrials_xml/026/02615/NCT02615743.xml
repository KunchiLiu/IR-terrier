	<brief_title>Asthma Controller Adherence After Hospitalization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Poor adherence inhale controller medication asthma well-documented poorly understood problem disproportionate prevalence impact urban minority child . Recent randomized trial country use electronic monitoring inhale steroid automate adherence feedback demonstrate dramatic improvement adherence behavior . Whether similar intervention effect expect high-risk child US unknown . To accomplish objective , investigator propose enroll 40 child parent ( 20 parent/child dyad arm ) two-month pilot randomize control trial automate adherence feedback intervention . Children West Philadelphia , age 4-11 , must hospitalize asthma The Children 's Hospital Philadelphia . The study intervention include daily automate medication reminder via text messaging subject randomize intervention group . Inhaled controller medication adherence measure group use electronic monitor affix top canister inhale steroid medication adherence trajectory determine use group-based trajectory modeling . Factors associate adherence trajectory assess use survey complete upon enrollment , completion treatment phase ( 1 month ) upon completion follow ( 2 month ) . Feasibility outcomes include use , acceptance , preference . Limited efficacy outcome include change parent-reported asthma control difference average percent adherence intervention control condition . Findings study provide preliminary data large study evaluate mechanisms differential adherence trajectory effect adherence feedback intervention different mechanisms non-adherence .</detailed_description>
