	<detailed_description>Approximately 60 % American adult population prehypertension hypertension . Subgroups African Americans , elderly , low-socioeconomic-status , overweight population , disproportionately affect . Larkin Community Hospital ( LCH ) affiliate site provide great number patient particular subgroup represent ideal institution study tremendous health issue . Hypertension progressive disease shownÂ·that , later life , patient borderline hypertension progress much high rate Stage 1 2 hypertension compare normotensive population . The Framingham study demonstrate 26 year follow , 71 % patient high-normal blood pressure ( systolic , 130-139 mm Hg ; diastolic , 85-89 ) develop clinical hypertension later life . The Tecumseh blood pressure study show subject age 20 40 year old borderline hypertension ( average BP 130.7/93.8 ) significantly high childhood ( average age 6 year ) BP level compare normotensive one , illustrate propensity disease progress . Also , bell-shaped curve blood pressure general population show large group people blood pressure prehypertensive range , show large proportion population would affect advance management disease . Osteopathic manipulative therapy ( OMT ) therapeutic modality utilized osteopathic physician address somatic dysfunction musculoskeletal system . Somatic dysfunction abnormality musculoskeletal tissue texture intervertebral joint dysfunction . Close association spinal vertebrae autonomic nervous system via sympathetic trunk ganglion believe one mechanism musculoskeletal system change affect organ ( somatovisceral reflex ) . Indeed , osteopathic philosophy posit OMT distinct effect beyond musculoskeletal system . Additionally , autonomic lymphatic system effect upon function cardiovascular system extensively study . OMT show Stiles significantly decrease mortality morbidity patient cardiovascular dysfunction . Rogers et al . also report OMT demonstrate significant value patient coronary insufficiency . The bulk sympathetic nervous system lie adjacent thoracic spine well superior lumbar spine . Particularly , sympathetic innervation heart origins cord segment T1-T6 , synapses occur pre-and post-ganglionic fiber upper thoracic and/or cervical ganglion . As previously discuss , alteration spinal mechanic presence somatic dysfunction region spine theorize alter function autonomic nervous system originate region . Specific cardiovascular effect dysfunction increase heart rate , increase contractility , increase cardiac work-load , increase total peripheral resistance . To provide evidence link musculoskeletal system cardiovascular system , demonstrate patient Travell triggerpoints right pectoralis muscle may prone period supraventricular tachyarrhythmias . When trigger point etiologies arrhythmia , arrhythmia disappears trigger point effectively treat . The goal study demonstrate use OMT effective management hypertension . The investigator hypothesize addressing/correcting somatic dysfunction OMT , downregulate sympathetic overdrive could root cause elevation blood pressure . If case , effective therapy hypertension could indeed regular OMT treatment . This could also result avoidance potentially harmful antihypertensive medication comprise majority current therapeutic strategy treatment hypertension ( along lifestyle modification ) . A third implication result project could reduction progression disease . As discussed , majority hypertensive patient experience worsen disease time current therapeutic guideline .</detailed_description>
