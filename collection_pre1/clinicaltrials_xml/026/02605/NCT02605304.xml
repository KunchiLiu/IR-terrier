	<brief_summary>People infect Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) great chance cure infection treat sofosbuvir . However , instance , treatment sofosbuvir-containing therapy work . It known treat people sofosbuvir ( retreatment ) work first time work . There important need understand retreatment option instance . This study do see two different regimen , ledipasvir sofosbuvir ribavirin 12 week ( Group A ) ledipasvir sofosbuvir 24 week ( Group B ) well tolerate HCV-infected person previous treatment sofosbuvir fail . This study also look safety regimen well combination treatment ledipasvir/sofosbuvir work people cirrhosis ( scar liver ) HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>12 Weeks Ledipasvir ( LDV ) /Sofosbuvir ( SOF ) With Weight-based Ribavirin vs. 24 Weeks LDV/SOF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There press need understand appropriate retreatment option HCV-infected patient fail direct act antiviral ( DAA ) -based regimen . To date , 100,000 prescription write SOF . Recent data indicate SOF-based treatment define SOF/RBV , SOF/pegylated-interferon ( PEG ) /RBV SOF/simeprevir ( SIM ) +/- RBV lead SVR4 70-92 % HCV genotype ( GT ) 1 patient , depend regimen use presence cirrhosis . Thus , grow number individual fail SOF-based regimen need retreatment strategy , majority anticipate HCV GT1 , give US distribution genotype . There data inform retreatment strategy HIV-infected individual SOF failure , traditionally represent hard treat group impact DAA-ARV interaction . This study phase II retreatment study HCV GT1 HIV coinfected patient previous virologic failure SOF-based regimen . SOF-failures represent challenge group retreat already failed one potent regimen , many case may fail prior regimen well . This study provide much need pilot data evaluate retreatment strategy LDV/SOF prior SOF-failures HIV/HCV coinfection , include cirrhosis . Participants study randomized one two treatment group : 12 week LDV/SOF weight-based RBV 24 week LDV/SOF alone . The participant follow additional 24 week completion study treatment . The first 15 participant ARV regimens HIV PI/r tenofovir require participate PK component order participate study . These first 15 participant PI/r tenofovir enroll study undergo semi-intensive PK sampling ( pre-dose , hour 1 hour 4 ) week 0 4 quantification tenofovir plasma . After first 15 participant enrol , subsequent participant take HIV PI/r tenofovir may opt PK evaluation still participate study .</detailed_description>
