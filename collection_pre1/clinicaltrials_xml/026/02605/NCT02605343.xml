	<detailed_description>The incidence opioid-related adverse drug event reach high 50 % surgical patient poor pain management significant risk factor early readmission . In addition , rate non- response certain analgesic double patient poor metabolizers demonstrate mutation CPY26D allele . There grow body literature indicate ineffective acute pain management contribute significantly risk chronic pain syndrome . Genetics drug interaction alter pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics multitude drug compound turn influence safety efficacy select therapeutic regimen . Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy selection enhance patient response facilitate selection appropriate medication effective dose short possible time . In prospective , observational , single-blind study , investigator evaluate clinical impact pharmacogenetics-guided treatment patient well-being determine post-op pain assessment frequency change analgesic predict test result . Additionally , impact PGx-guided treatment narcotic consumption , time mobilization , number adverse event , length stay , re-admission rate compare historical data evaluate duration study .</detailed_description>
