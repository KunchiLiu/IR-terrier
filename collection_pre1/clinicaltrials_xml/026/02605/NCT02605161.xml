	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common neurodegenerative movement disorder age . Its cause unknown . Current evidence support stress-diathesis model pathogenesis whereby yet-to-be identify environmental trigger conspires permissive genetic background initiate disease process . Based neuropathological observation neurodegenerative disease , chronic traumatic encephalopathy pathological protein aggregate form close association damage blood vessel , investigator hypothesize environmental trigger resides bloodstream . As corollary hypothesis , investigator propose PD pathological process begin brain affected individual disruption blood brain barrier ( BBB ) , thereby allow access incite agent nigrostriatal axon terminal neostriatum . This form foundation investigator ' hypothesis BBB neostriatum PD patient disrupt . Indeed , post-mortem study , investigator demonstrate histopathological evidence significant striatal BBB disruption section striatum PD subject relative age-matched control . Critics study indicate post-mortem effect may result artefactual disruption BBB , call question validity relevance potentially important find PD pathogenesis progression . Therefore , investigator perform image study live PD patient follow-up convince post-mortem study definitively establish whether BBB dysfunction feature PD . The neostriatal BBB dysfunctional PD patient relative control demonstrate significantly increase parenchymal enhancement magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The result study could important implication understand PD pathogenesis . There emerge evidence key pathogenetic event PD pathogenesis , aggregation alpha-synuclein , begin within axon terminal neuron . The neuron severely affect PD reside substantia nigra project neostriatum . Demonstrating disruption BBB PD striatum would render nigrostriatal axon terminal susceptible blood-borne disease trigger allow researcher generate hypothesis regard identity trigger . Immune/inflammatory candidate particularly attractive regard . The result study may also therapeutic implication . For example , alpha-synuclein disaggregating agent achieve therapeutic utility come year , study may indicate agent may capable access nigrostriatal axon terminal without require pharmaceutical mechanical disruption BBB .</detailed_description>
