	<detailed_description>Research Strategy A . SPECIFIC AIMS The continue rise incidence type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) globally match successful effort prevention amelioration disease . Additionally , huge gap exist understanding adjacent gastrointestinal milieu pancreatic islet destructive process occur lead insulin-dependence T1DM . The large increase incidence type 1 diabetes past decade occur child 5 year age , group particularly susceptible diabetes related morbidity mortality . Invasive methodology via finger prick glucose monitoring subcutaneous insulin injection remain standard care require patient survival . Many intervention study conduct base inadequately substantiate knowledge mechanism ( presume exclusively autoimmune ) cause permanent beta-cell destruction type 1 diabetes . Almost intervention trial new-onset type 1 diabetes show transient improvement insulin production ( 6 month ) subsequent decline level similar control arm . Moreover , scientific argument data suggest non autoimmune pathogenic mechanism may involve , perhaps toxic generalize affliction pancreas . Recent evidence beta-cells continue regenerate pancreas patient long-standing type 1 diabetes offer hope disease process lead insulin-dependence may reverse islet destruction arrest critical window time . The link type 1 diabetes gut microbiome actively explore . Emerging evidence suggest role gut microbiome destruction protection islet type 1 diabetes-prone experimental model . In addition , type 1 diabetes prevent genetically establish murine model disease animal restrict gluten-free diet . The specific hypothesis addressed application gluten-free diet introduce shortly diagnosis reverse halt progression type 1 diabetes child adolescent . Our propose mechanism gluten-free diet preserve endogenous insulin production via alter gut microbiota towards strain inherently less toxic islet . The study design comprehensive assessment role gluten-free diet child T1DM . A specific objective reduce modify patient ' gut microbiota early disease process possible mean arrest islet destruction . The specific measurable aim current application outline innovative approach begin identification beta-cell protective effect specific change gut flora therapeutically develop ameliorate type 1 diabetes . Specific Aim 1 : To determine effect gluten-free diet endogenous insulin secretion pancreatic morphology child adolescents new-onset type 1 diabetes . Specific Aim 2 : To determine effect gluten-free diet gut flora patient new-onset type 1 diabetes . Resultant data allow determination relation gut flora beta- cell function patient new-onset diabetes . Collectively , propose study innovative new-onset T1DM child . A large population patient currently receive care Pediatric Diabetes Clinics Loma Linda University ( LLU ) currently provide care approximately 2000 patient T1DM . On average , three five patient new-onset T1DM diagnose LLU Children 's Hospital every week . This proposal consistent research theme university focus diet health , much line 'Wholeness ' mission institution . In collaboration new Genomic Center LLU , unique opportunity evaluate novel mechanism T1DM . In future , lead sustain research program diet therapy type 1 diabetes , allow site design pioneer multi-center trial field , optimize chance attract generous extramural funding . The preliminary data study form basis RO1 application . B . Significance Type 1 diabetes mellitus common metabolic disease childhood . Every year , approximately twenty thousand child diagnose type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) United States alone accord Centers Disease Control Prevention . The incidence T1DM continue increase worldwide . The large increase global incidence T1DM past two decade occur child 5 year age , group particularly susceptible diabetes-related morbidity mortality . As one common chronic illness child , T1DM extensively study concluded consequence autoimmune destruction insulin-producing pancreatic islet beta-cells genetically susceptible individual . Despite increase prevalence type 2 diabetes , T1DM remain common form diabetes childhood , account approximately two-thirds new diagnosis diabetes patient 19 year age United States . The acute complication T1DM include hypoglycemia , ketoacidosis , severe psychopathology , potentially fatal . The origin profoundly disable long-term complication blindness , kidney failure amputation significantly obliterate glycemic control maintain early onset disease . A large body data emerge role gut microbiome health disease . Recent study provide evidence role structural modulation gut microbiota pathogenesis type 2 diabetes , type diabetes common adult . Similar evidence observe disorder obesity cardiovascular disease . These study suggest alteration composition intestinal microbiota may link development several disease , yet clearly implicated patient type 1 diabetes . More recently , special focus direct role gut bacteria destruction versus protection pancreatic islet . This first study T1DM-prone experimental model . Since type-1 diabetes-related protein identify wheat , T1DM murine model show reduction diabetes-associated cell subset put wheat-free diet . Moreover , type 1 diabetes prevent genetically establish murine model disease restrict gluten-free diet . In young child genetically susceptible T1DM , gut bacteria notably less diverse less stable group progress develop type 1 diabetes autoimmunity . Of interest report increase incidence type 1 diabetes child , retrospective review , receive proton pump inhibitor therapy ( NIH , personal communication ) . Additionally , publish report remission T1DM 6 year old child maintain strictly adhere gluten-free diet without insulin therapy . This trigger multicenter pilot study currently take place Northern Europe preliminary data suggest gluten-free diet preserve insulin secretion adult type 1 diabetes . To knowledge , none patient maintain gluten free diet undergone study gut microbiome date . At LLU , three year follow diagnosis type 1 diabetes , one 17-year old patient Loma Linda University pediatric diabetes clinic maintain excellent glycemic control despite unusually low insulin requirement ( call prolong honeymoon phase ) adhere gluten free diet . Two patient LLU , age 3 4 year , experience significant decline insulin requirement ( honeymoon dos , i.e . total daily insulin le 0.5 unit per kg ) , necessitate discontinuation insulin pump one case , follow six month gluten-free diet . Taken together , data case suggest u alter gut microbiota onset disease via gluten-free diet may significantly preserve endogenous insulin production , thereby minimize need insulin injection optimize long-term health patient type 1 diabetes . Access large T1DM patient population Loma Linda University Children 's Hospital clinic offer unique opportunity exploration novel dietary approach may contribute tip balance within pancreas towards islet function regeneration . When optimize , pave way patient T1DM achieve insulin independence . C. Innovation This proposal challenge traditional widely accept autoimmune mechanism development T1DM , add previous data role ambient direct toxic factor development T1DM child . In large case-control study , previously describe novel significant association type 1 diabetes cumulative ambient ozone exposure birth time diagnosis . Additionally , already show patient 5 year age , group large increase incidence globally , frequently lack evidence know type 1 diabetes autoimmune marker . Moreover , rapid rate increase incidence decline age T1DM suggest aggressive toxic element rather slow autoimmune process play pivotal role pathogenesis disease child . The project introduce new potential etiology type 1 diabetes human : Bacterial Hypothesis . Here , investigate novel , outstandingly safe , potentially curative approach T1DM , consist merely dietary modification change gut microbiota towards permissive milieu insulin secretion . Most intervention trial new-onset T1DM open design , many trial investigational agent 's side-effects allow participate subject know whether receive active drug . Thus , interpretation result intervention study date deem accurate give probable placebo effect . The current study design incorporate placebo effect study control subject . To knowledge , first randomize placebo control trial test effect dietary modification gut flora glycemic control child newly diagnose type 1 diabetes . D. Approach This randomize controlled clinical trial test effect alter gut bacteria via gluten-free diet pace severity islet destruction T1DM within six month diagnosis . The project entail modify meal content , frequency rate consumption , assess bacterial gut flora endogenous insulin production one year follow enrollment . The current proposal base current level knowledge T1DM disease process , caveat current intervention study , desirability intervention minimum side effect child . The objective current proposal change gut flora reduce bacterial escape stomach duodenum way may direct detoxification effect adjacent pancreas insulin produce islet cell . The proposal test effect eliminate gluten diet reduce change gut flora manner conducive insulin secretion beta cell . As amount bacteria enter duodenum extremely dependent type food , well volume meal , establish benefit eat small frequent meal may prove particularly useful patient type 1 DM . The propose dietary intervention likely substantially influence bacterial flora duodenum without inflict significant harm child 's health , growth development . D1 . Specific Aim 1 : To determine effect gluten-free diet endogenous insulin secretion child adolescents new-onset type 1 diabetes . Subject Recruitment Sample Size . Subjects diagnose type 1 diabetes recruit LLU Children 's Hospitals clinic within first six month diagnosis . Participating subject randomize one two study group , consist 25 30 subject provide 80 % power detect significant difference endogenous insulin production ( Area C-peptide curve mixed meal tolerance test ) . Inclusion criterion : Ages : 1-17 year ; diagnosis type 1 diabetes within 6 month enrollment ; parent guardian willing sign inform consent comply basal bolus insulin treatment well study procedure diet guideline . Exclusion criterion : Diabetes diagnose one year age ; patient know malabsorption malnutrition ; glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1C value 9 % three month follow diagnosis ( general screen noncompliance treatment guideline ) . Study assessment time point : enrollment , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month . The procedure conduct beyond scope routine care type 1 diabetes : stool sample collection enrollment 3 , 6 , 9 12 month ; mixed meal tolerance test ( MMTT ) enrollment , 6 12 month . MMTT standard research tool assess islet functional reserve measure basal stimulate blood glucose C-peptide 30 minute interval two hour ( time zero ) standard high caloric formula . At diagnosis , subject undergo routine institutional diabetes protocol laboratory test include diabetes autoimmune antibody : Glutamic acid decarboxylase , Islet Cell Antibodies , Insulin Autoantibodies , Zinc transporter 8 antibody , well thyroid celiac antibody . A fasting lipid panel thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) also measure initial evaluation . The level 25 hydroxyvitamin D measure baseline screen malabsorption nutritional deficiency particularly view suspect role vitamin D T1DM . The standard care type 1 diabetes include quarterly encounter diabetes team include physician , nurse , dietitian , together quarterly assessment glucose profile , glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1C ) , appropriateness insulin treatment regimens adjustment need . Study subject divide two group follow : Study group A subject receive standard T1DM basal bolus insulin regimens guided physician , nurse , nutritional consult ensure adequate knowledge diabetes diet recommendation carbohydrate- base insulin dose . In addition , subject receive instruction consume `` gluten-free '' diet ( e.g . replace white bread potato rice , gluten-free bread food ) . Group A also encourage increase time consumption meal reduce volume meal include volume liquid ( i.e . subject eat volume food desire small frequent meal ) . Study group B receive standard T1DM basal bolus insulin regimen guideline physician , nurse , nutritionist give normal meal recommendation subject T1DM without gluten intake volume restriction . Caloric carbohydrate daily recommendation tailor age different two study group . Subjects show strong serologic evidence gluten hypersensitivity exclude two main study group start gluten-free diet . Their data track retrospectively significant outcome difference may attributable pre-existing gluten hypersensitivity alone . Gut bacteria study every assessment time-point via stool sample study group . Glycosylated hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1C ) measure diagnosis every three month together dietitian 's assessment ensure compliance designate diet instruction . Mixed meal tolerance test basal stimulate C-peptide measurement do enrollment , 6 month one year post-enrollment . Peak level area curve stimulate C-peptide compare intervention control group . Every assessment time-point include stool sample characterization bacterial flora gut time . Stool test time-point include regular bacterial strain identification well genomic assessment .</detailed_description>
