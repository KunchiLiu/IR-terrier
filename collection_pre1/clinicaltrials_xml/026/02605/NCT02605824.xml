	<brief_summary>This study evaluate 20 % n-acetylcystine ( NAC ) treatment moderate-to-severe asthma complicate mucus airway , determine CT image . The study crossover design , mean half study participant get 20 % NAC first 7-day treatment period placebo next 7-day treatment period ; half get placebo first 7-day treatment period 20 % NAC next 7-day treatment period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial NAC Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>n-acetylcystine ( NAC ) mucolytic medication , mean break apart mucus . Investigators know mucus factor severe asthma attack . However , mucus may factor chronic severe asthma well . This role hard prove difficulty show mucus occludes lumen chronic severe disease . Using novel approach score mucus occlusion , investigator use CT image uncover majority people severe asthma least one lung segment mucus plug 27 % four lung segment mucus plug . Historically , study mucolytics , like NAC , show benefit obstructive lung disease , like COPD . However , utilize CT mucus score biomarker , investigator believe mucolytic treatment may prove useful significant mucus impaction . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase 4 study 20 % NAC patient asthma also evidence mucus lung determine CT image . Investigators hypothesize treat asthmatic , chosen base presence mucus airway , mucolytic like NAC , result improvement lung function .</detailed_description>
