	<brief_title>Palbociclib Combination With Bicalutamide Treatment AR ( + ) Metastatic Breast Cancer ( MBC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study therapy self administer outpatient basis . Patients meet eligibility criterion sign inform consent Step 2 may begin treatment study . Treatment consist bicalutamide orally daily palbociclib give orally daily 3 week follow 1 week . A treatment cycle consider 4 week . Eligible patient evaluate toxicity every 2 week Cycle # 1 2 , follow every 4 week subsequent cycle . Toxicity assessment include history , physical examination include vital sign , laboratory include complete blood count comprehensive metabolic panel . Patients keep drug diary document adherence oral therapy . Radiographic response evaluation per RECIST occur every 8 week ( 2 cycle ) cycle 1-6 every 12 week thereafter high-resolution CT scan . Patients suspect bone-only lesion must bone lesion assess CT bone windows bone scan screening . Phase I : We use standard 3+3 design dose find lead establish recommended phase II dose combination palbociclib bicalutamide . The dos Phase I determine base dose level patient accrue . Phase II : Treatment consist bicalutamide orally daily palbociclib give orally daily 3 week follow 1 week dos determine phase I .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient eligible androgen receptor expression test ( STEP 1 ) follow criterion meet : Female Pathologically confirm invasive cancer breast ER/PR status ( ER PR define positive ≥1 % ; ER/PR define negative 0 % ) : Note therapeutic portion trial : Phase I : Patients may ER/PR ( + ) ( ) breast cancer . ER ( + ) patient must progression disease follow 1 prior line endocrine therapy . Progression disease within 6 month adjuvant endocrine therapy consider 1 line prior endocrine therapy . Phase II : Patients must ER/PR ( ) breast cancer . HER2 normal ( IHC 01 ; FISH &lt; 2.0 ) Nonmeasurable measurable , metastatic disease Available tissue AR test A patient eligible participation therapeutic trial ( STEP 2 ) follow criterion meet : Androgen receptor expression test confirms patient 's tumor AR ( + ) . AR consider positive ≥1 % cell nuclei immunoreactive use Dako antibody ( clone AR441 ) . Receptor test may perform either primary tumor specimen tissue metastatic site . Local test permitted eligibility require confirmation MSKCC . There limit number prior chemotherapy endocrine therapy regimens allow . Patients ER ( + ) AR ( + ) breast cancer must least 1 prior line endocrine therapy eligible phase I portion trial . At least 2 week since last cytotoxic chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiotherapy . Toxicities related prior therapy must either return grade 1 , baseline ( exclude alopecia ) Patient may receive bisphosphonates/denosumab palliation bone metastases If patient history brain metastasis leptomeningeal disease , lesion must stable least 3 month ( document either head CT brain MRI ) Prior treatment bicalutamide allow At least 3 week major surgery full recovery ECOG performance status 02 Age 18 year great Postmenopausal . Use LHRH agonist permit . Patients must another , nonbreast , active malignancy require treatment . The effect palbociclib develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) . Women must breast feed study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Ability swallow intact palbociclib capsule bicalutamide tablet . Adequate organ marrow function define ( ULN indicate institutional upper limit normal ) : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 10^9/ Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL WBC ≥ 3.0 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 10^9/L Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN except patient know Gilbert syndrome AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 institutional ULN Plasma creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 mL/min ( calculate CockcroftGault method ) QTc interval ≤ 470 msec Patients recover adverse event prior therapy ≤ NCI CTCAEv4.0 Grade 1 . Patients receive investigational anticancer agent . Patients receive prior treatment selective CDK4/6 inhibitor History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition palbociclib . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , know ongoing active infection , include HIV , active hepatitis B C , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia ( specifically , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation ventricular dysrhythmias except ventricular premature contraction ) , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman woman breastfeed . Patients history longQT syndrome document family history longQT syndrome . Patients must remain drug prolong QT interval . Palbociclib substrate CYP3A . Caution exercise dose palbociclib concurrently CYP3A inducer inhibitor . Furthermore , patient take concurrent medication strong inducers/inhibitors substrates CYP3A4 switch alternative medication minimize potential risk .</criteria>
