	<brief_title>Ultra Violet-C Light Evaluation Adjunct Removing Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms ( UVCLEAR-MDRO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective cleaning patient environment ( patient room hospital stay ) subject human factor unfortunately often inconsistent inadequate . Patient room residual bacteria routine environmental cleaning act reservoirs multidrug-resistant organism ( MDROs ) contribute spread MDROs patient patient . In set increased focus Healthcare-associated Infections Clostridium difficile ( C. difficile ) multidrug-resistant Gram negative Gram positive organism carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ( CRE ) , vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus ( VRE ) methicillin-resistant Staphlococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , Ultra-Violet C ( UV-C ) light show safe , effective way decrease burden MDROs patient room . However , study examine effectiveness UV-C light use post daily discharge patient room clean lack . This study cluster , randomize , two-period cross trial investigate relationship environmental decontamination UV-C light transmission VRE healthcare-associated bacteria . It investigate hypothesis UV-C addition daily clean lead decrease patient acquisition healthcare-associated bacteria . This study important advance hospital-based infection prevention knowledge impact UV-C light environmental cleaning .</detailed_description>
