	<brief_summary>Mass drug administration antimalarial treatment tool potentially reduce totally eliminate malaria parasite infection population . Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA/PPQ ) give monthly 3 month entire population might good candidate mass drug administration long act PPQ exerts long post-treatment prophylactic effect reinfection relapse . The use repeat dose DHA/PPQ could lead increase PPQ plasma concentration increase cardiotoxicity . However , data second course treatment safety drug administer repeat monthly dos . The propose project clinical trial ass electrocardiographic safety monthly DHA/PPQ ( 3 day time ) 3 month . The investigator aim assess safety drug use monthly mass treatment campaign . Recommendations issue study benefit health authority Lihir-Island setting stage possible subsequent campaign completely eliminate malaria whole island . This study could crucial step inform feasibility drug-based strategy eliminate malaria elsewhere PNG , Melanesian country throughout world .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Safety Repeated Doses Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Use Mass Treatment Campaigns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given absence regulatory data relate safety repeat dosing , European Medicines Agency set conservatively long 2-month `` wash-out '' period administration subsequent course recommend . Unfortunately recommendation would make impossible implement effective mass drug administration PPQ probably require maximum interval one month dos ( order ensure drug level remain high enough prevent infection occur dos ) . Therefore important formal evaluation perform regulatory standard conclusively document safety repeat monthly dos PPQ . The extensive previous experience monthly PPQ administration China suggest study would pose minimal risk study participant . Various study look potential DHA/PPQ cause prolongation correct QT interval ( QTc ) interval human . In study 62 adult child , Cambodia , electrocardiographic ( ECG ) find DHA/PPQ treatment show lengthening mean QTc 11 m . In two randomized control trial Thailand , mean QTc prolongation 56 patient 14 m last dose DHA/PPQ . The degree QT prolongation observe study therefore similar see anti-malarial drug ( include lumefantrine , chloroquine ) generally consider cardiotoxicity conventional dosing , substantially less others halofantrine.and quinidine associate cardiotoxicity . Study-DM09-006 compare QTc data healthy subject receive DHA/PPQ respective placebo group find maximum mean QT Fridericia 's correction ( QTcF ) prolongation 45.2 m co-administered high fat , 21.0 m fasting ( EMEA/H/C/119 ) . Of total 96 participant give DHA/PPQ three study mention , subject show QTc &gt; 500ms post-treatment prolongation ( after- v pre-dose ) &gt; 60ms . The propose project pharmacovigilance study electrocardiographic safety evaluation monthly DHA/PPQ ( administer conventional 3-day course repeat monthly 3 month ) . The investigator aim assess safety drug use monthly mass treatment campaign .</detailed_description>
