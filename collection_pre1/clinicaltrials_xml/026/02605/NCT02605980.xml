'' The aim study identify key physiological psychological outcome influence acute period inactivity older people feel acute period inactivity . The investigator ' main objective determine , direct measurement self report , acute functional cognitive effect differ period sit time . A secondary objective inform old people , professional organisation work old people policy maker duration sedentary behaviour lead adverse outcome old people . The investigator recruit ambulatory men woman age 70 study three separate occasion , approximately one week apart complete sedentary bout 1 h , 2 h 4 h randomise crossover design . The investigator explore relationship sit time change low limb explosive power ( primary outcome ) measure bout . Secondary outcome include timed chair rise; Timed Up Go; blood pressure; perception musculoskeletal comfort/pain , vitality; mood cognitive function . The investigator also measure stress hormone cortisol sample saliva take start sit session , 1 h , 2h 4 h later . Characterising acute effect sit time old adult enable design intervention reduce sedentary time well inform professional policy maker duration sedentary behaviour lead adverse outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Until relatively recently , sedentary behaviour consider 'lower end ' physical activity spectrum . However accumulate evidence epidemiological observational study show sedentary behaviour per se rather low physical activity also major modifiable risk factor chronic disease predict cardiovascular all-cause mortality , independent amount physical activity : A followup Australian Diabetic ( AusDiab ) cohort study show 46 % increase risk all-cause 80 % increase risk cardiovascular disease mortality watch four hour television ( TV ) per day , compare watch TV &lt; 2 h per day . In Canadian Fitness Survey , dose response relationship show sit time cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality . Significantly poor long term mortality outcomes find report spending day sit compare report less time sit consistent across level self report sitting time . Crucially , sit time mortality relationships apparent even among physically active time point day . Although evidence support long term detrimental health effect prolong bout sedentary behaviour ( sit ) across age range , limited information exists respect acute ( 'last bout ' ) effect sedentariness physiological psychological health old people . Interestingly current UK physical activity guideline state `` sufficient evidence support recommendation reduce sedentary behaviour older adult , currently possible suggest specific time limit '' . There need able characterise sit time old adult term acute functional cognitive effect , well identify main effect older people perceive important period sit . Thus possibility generate specific advice old people , require elucidation dose response relationship sit health outcome define carefully control study . Although study yet conduct , possible select 'key ' outcome measure base upon establish evidence derive epidemiological small scale observational study ( viz recent study report significant negative association sedentariness physical psychological impairment old adult ) well 'models ' physical inactivity bed rest limb unload . One outcome skeletal muscle power output . The ability quickly produce sufficient muscle power paramount importance control body movement mobility relate activity old people , stand chair stair climb . Muscle power output therefore functionally relevant outcome utmost importance maintenance physical independence . In addition , old people less able maintain core temperature , partly due reduce muscle mass yet know reduce muscle temperature 1˚C result decline power output 26 % . Work current study group recently show reduction muscle power ( 45 % ) , sit stand performance velocity ( 9 % ) , gait speed maximum quadriceps strength 45 minute sit cool environment ( 15 degree Celsius ) . It known sit ( consequent muscle inactivity ) normal temperature environment lead reduced power old people . However , old people talk difficulty get chair sit long period , muscle power may implicate . In old people joint pain , benefit keep move sit clear . Although work effect cold environment cognition ( dual task cost walk speed executive function use trail make test ) show significant change 45 minute exposure 15 degree Celsius old people , little known effect mood , well cognitive psychological outcome sit . Associations sit tiredness depression show longitudinal study middle age Australian cohort spend total &gt; 9 h/day sit compare spent &lt; 6 h/day sit . However little known effect acute bout sit . Although body evidence acute effect physical activity , publish data report acute effect sit , dose response effect psychological outcome find . Thus , current understand acute effect sit time severely limited . The propose study inform development , implementation evaluation future intervention reduce sedentary behaviour old people identify key element immediate ( acute ) benefit break long period sit , aid engagement old adult immediate individual level benefit reduce sit identify outcome measure sensitive change sit time . Alongside view old people , provide practical message ensure effective take intervention among old people effective advice professional work old people . For example , professional work residential home setting hospital wards/ intermediate transition care setting ( post acute illness surgery ) , result research give valuable information desirable time period encourage mobilisation .</detailed_description>
