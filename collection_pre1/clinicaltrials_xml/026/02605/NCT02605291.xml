	<brief_title>Dietary Macronutrient Manipulation Substrate Oxidation During Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One way help reduce body fat expend energy oxidation fat fuel . Exercise one way increase fat oxidation . The extent exercise facilitate use fat fuel may influence individual 's dietary intake . This study aim establish effect dietary macronutrient manipulation muscle glycogen level substrate oxidation exercise . Participants undertake three separate trial period . During trial period participant consume diet contain different macronutrient composition . For trial investigator assess macronutrient composition diet affect muscle glycogen level substrate oxidation exercise .</detailed_description>
