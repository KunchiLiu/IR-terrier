	<detailed_description>Introduction Lysosomes small , cytoplasmic organelle contain several acid hydrolase enzyme . These enzyme break foreign material cellular debris allow lysosome act recycle center cell . Following DNA transcription , lysosomal enzyme produce endoplasmic reticulum target lysosome specific recognition marker . If one enzymes absent function diminish due either alter amino acid sequence protein defective intracellular trafficking , macromolecule metabolize specific enzyme gradually accumulate lysosome . Abnormal substrate storage lead cellular dysfunction follow cell death ultimately manifest tissue damage organ failure . Gaucher disease ( GD ) lysosomal storage disorder cause genetic deficiency lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase . GD lead accumulation glycosphingolipids various tissue system , notably cell mononuclear phagocyte system result wide range heterogenous phenotypic effect affected individual . Clinical manifestation GD affect across multiple organ range immune dysregulations , splenomegaly bone crisis osteoporosis . Carrier frequency 1 200 general population incidence 1 60,000 . However , certain population , Ashkenazi Jews , incidence could high 1 1,000 . Background Significance Macrophage direct Enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) accept form treatment GD . However still unmet need treat aspect GD use ERT . As alternative ERT , substrate reduction therapy ( SRT ) develop use glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor . While ERT devise target macrophage affect cell type , SRT mean reach broad cell type . It vital know form therapy act different cell type tissue choose administer either form treatment individual patient . Our preliminary immune phenotyping result reveal patient GD undergo treatment manifest various kind persistent immune dysregulations . Information regard type therapy work well control dysregulations would give valuable information treatment option . In-depth analysis peripheral blood would shed light various component immune system affect either form treatment . The investigator address issue two aspect : ) Evaluate cytokine profile plasma see report pain correlate particular cytokine profile . b ) Assess extent bone disease could predict explain use marker peripheral blood relation pathway involve bone remodel . The finding individual GD patient would compare parallel disease severity bone density finding . In study , effect ERT v SRT closely monitor compare , particularly keep mind immunological aspect well bone remodel . For , in-depth immunophenotyping patient administer form therapy evaluate various immune cell type include T- , B- NK cell , monocyte dendritic cell fraction peripheral blood use multi-parametric flow cytometry perform . In addition investigator like assess macrophage activation use assay secrete CCL18 chitotriosidase well study cytokine profile plasma evaluate contribution bone pain/crisis . In order investigate extent bone remodeling could predict explain use marker peripheral blood , expression RANK/RANKL pathway component would assess relevant immune cell type . Cell base vitro assay would develop utilized study differentiation macrophage function . The result individual GD patient would compare parallel disease severity bone density finding . This proposal highly significant innovative , study expect provide insight form therapy influence immune dysregulations , macrophage function effect bone crisis Gaucher patient undergo ERT v SRT . Insight regard type therapy work well control dysregulations would give valuable information treatment option .</detailed_description>
