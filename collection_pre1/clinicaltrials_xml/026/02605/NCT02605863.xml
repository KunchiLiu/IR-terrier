	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Bladder Cancer Chemoprevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- A blood draw electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . The blood draw check level testosterone , dihydro-testosterone , estradiol , Vitamin D. Pre-study blood-work also include complete blood count ( CBC ) , basic metabolic panel ( BMP/CHEM8 ) liver function test ( LFT ) labs draw within 1 month prior transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) . - Bladder tumor sample store Department Pathology additional test run confirm study eligibility test certain cell marker . - After 1 month follow original TURBT , subject begin therapy enzalutamide . The study drug administer orally dose 160mg daily 12 month . - Subjects monitor adverse reaction side effect enzalutamide schedule office visit . - If bladder tumor classify `` intermediate risk '' , regularly schedule office visit occur 2 month post-operatively ( i.e. , 1 month start enzalutamide ) , post-operative month 3 , 6 , 9 12 , part usual standard care . - If bladder tumor classify `` high risk '' subject receive BCG therapy , office visit occur slightly different schedule conform standard care type disease . Subjects group typically start intravesical BCG instillation 4-6 week post-operatively . Therefore , subject see approximately 1 month follow initial TURBT , begin therapy enzalutamide time , describe . Subjects study drug least 7 day prior initiation BCG therapy , occur week 6 week . Similar subject intermediate risk group , subject receive BCG also see 1 month initiation enzalutamide therapy ensure adverse reaction study drug . Following visit , see time post-BCG cystoscopy , occur 1 month 6th instillation . Subjects see 3 , 6 , 9 12-month post-BCG cystoscopy office visit , part routine care . - Repeat blood work ( CBC , BMP LFTs ) check 1 month start enzalutamide ( approximately 2 month post-operatively ) . For subject intermediate risk bladder cancer , labs checked 3 , 6 , 9 12 month post-operatively ( per regularly schedule office visit ) . For high risk patient receive BCG therapy , lab check 1 , 3 , 6 9-month post-BCG office visit ( per regularly schedule office visit patient ) . - An EKG obtain baseline ( start study drug ) , also re-checked approximately 6 month ( half-way therapy enzalutamide ) ensure sign worsen cardiac disease study drug . - A cystoscopy do every 3 month part standard care bladder cancer follow-up . Lesions suspicious tumor recurrence biopsied per usual standard care . If recurrence document , subject discontinue use enzalutamide . - For subject schedule undergo therapy BCG , additional test run urine sample subject already provide Urology office part standard care .</detailed_description>
