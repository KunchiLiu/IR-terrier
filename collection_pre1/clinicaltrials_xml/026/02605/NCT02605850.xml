	<brief_summary>This study determine effect beneficial compound plant food , pomegranate cardiovascular health . This tested ask healthy male eat high fat ground beef patty pomegranate juice ( PJ ) , pomegranate extract ( PomX ) water measure blood vessel dilation ( endothelial function ) blood flow We also measure amount Nitric Oxide ( NO ) blood urine sample sugar insulin blood . Healthy men choose study eat high fat hamburger patty easily mimic condition cause atherosclerosis . The result study may help explain high fat food harmful body beneficial plant food cardiovascular function</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Specific Aims Objectives 1 . Peripheral arterial reactivity tonometry high fat meal pomegranate consumption 2 . To measure nitric oxide insulin response high fat meal pomegranate consumption These study lead well understanding role bioactive substance plant food pomegranate may demonstrate importance plant-based nutrient cardiovascular health . B . Background Polyphenols belong large group secondary metabolite produce plant , mainly , response biotic abiotic stress infection , wound , UV irradiation , exposure ozone , pollutant , hostile environmental condition . It think molecular basis protective action polyphenols plant antioxidant free radical scavenging property . Pomegranate ( Punica granatum L. ) grow commercially Near East , India , Spain , Israel United States ( California ) significant economic importance . Pomegranate fruit product , include juice , tea , wine extract widely consume recognize health benefit . Pomegranate ( Punica granatum L. ) fruit possess strong antioxidant , anti-inflammatory antiproliferative property . High-calorie meal rich saturate fat lead transient exaggerate elevation blood glucose , free fatty acid , triglyceride . This condition , term postprandial dysmetabolism , generate excess free radical ( reactive oxygen specie ) . The ensue oxidative stress trigger biochemical cascade throughout circulation , induce inflammation , endothelial dysfunction . These postprandial change , repeat multiple time day , create milieu conducive development atherosclerotic risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . In order investigate impact pomegranate polyphenols postprandial flow-mediated dilation , nitric oxide , glucose , insulin , triglycerides level men , propose achieve follow specific aim use randomize study design : 1 . Peripheral arterial reactivity tonometry high fat meal pomegranate consumption 2 . To measure nitric oxide insulin response high fat meal pomegranate consumption</detailed_description>
