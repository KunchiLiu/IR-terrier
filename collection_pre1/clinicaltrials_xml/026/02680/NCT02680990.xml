	<brief_title>Resilience Exercise Advanced Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A grow body evidence suggest host resilience ( lack frailty , skeletal muscle reserve , etc . ) may impact early healing , recovery follow neoadjuvant therapy surgery , long-term cancer-free survival . It well-recognized resilience enhance individual proper diet , sleep habit , exercise . However , unknown whether resilience enhance training program initiate time cancer diagnosis . Although exercise intervention may contribute improvement , unknown willing able patient comply exercise regimen neoadjuvant therapy period . The aim study , therefore , evaluate compliance efficacy Band Together , exercise program combine strength-training aerobic exercise , patient aggressive GI malignancy undergo neoadjuvant therapy .</detailed_description>
