	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Prostate Oligometastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research do determine improve outcome prostate cancer patient fail primary treatment - surgery local radiation prostate - 3 few bone metastasis . Patients metastatic prostate cancer disease usually place hormonal therapy work well period time , hormonal therapy side effect greatly trouble men . Any effort delay start hormonal therapy would advantage patient . Radiation treatment usually take many week deliver give high enough dos metastasis prevent come back locally . Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) highly focused radiation , give dose intensive fashion deliver usually less one week . Stereotactic body radiation show effective bone metastasis . Therefore , study effect stereotactic body radiation treatment patient five few prostate cancer bone metastases determine stall use hormonal therapy and/or prevent bone metastases develop elsewhere body . We also use investigational radioactive drug call 18F-DCFPyL help u find cancer spread ( metastatic disease ) original site people cancer prostate part body .</detailed_description>
