	<brief_title>Energy Consumption Cardiorespiratory Load During Walking With Without Robot-Assistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . Impaired cardiorespiratory fitness , major risk factor development cardiorespiratory disease , frequently report stroke patient . The mean energy cost walking , i.e . amount oxygen consumption milliliter per kilogram body-weight per meter , stroke patient almost twice high compare healthy subject ( resp . 0.27 ml/kg/m vs. 0.15 ml/kg/m ) . In rehabilitation stroke patient , primary aim improve kinematic functional gait-related parameter . However , due previously mention cardiorespiratory risk , important aware energy consumption cardiorespiratory load stroke patient gait rehabilitation . In past , gait train mainly fulfil treadmill training , overground train and/or conventional therapy , recent year , implementation robot-assistance gait rehabilitation increase . However , influence robot-assistance cardiorespiratory load energy consumption , therefore also potentially negative and/or positive side effect cardiorespiratory system , less investigated unclear . Up , short walk duration robot-assisted gait ( 7 minute ) seem less energy consume cardiorespiratory stressful walk without robot-assistance . However , influence longer walk duration clear . In addition , also unclear possible difference robot-assisted gait walk without robot-assistance might exist . One possible explanation might differences spatiotemporal gait parameter responsible difference energy consumption cardiorespiratory load . Patient recruitment . Stroke patient Rehabilitation Centre St. Ursula ( Herk-de-Stad , Belgium ) receive verbal write information aim intervention study . Eligible stroke patient , agree participate study , recruit . Signed informed consent obtain participant . Sample size . Sample size calculation base previous investigation indicate large effect size effect robot-assisted gait compare walk without robot-assistance energy consumption cardiorespiratory load ( base systematic review submit peer-review ) . To detect large effect size ( f = 0.40 ) robot-assisted gait compare overground treadmill gait energy consumption , cardiorespiratory load perceive fatigue , repeat measure within subject design ( 3 walk condition 4 measurement ) , significance level 5 % power level 80 % , sample size 21 subject need ( G*Power 3.1 Mac ) . Sample size inflate 24 subject , walk order perform number time . Intervention . Patients test 3 single walk session separate day : walking Lokomat 60 % guidance force , walk treadmill walk overground . Within subject , walk condition perform comfortable walk speed ( CWS ) , amount body-weight support ( BWS ) ( necessary ) total duration maximum 30 minute . The CWS ( maximum 3.2 kmph correspond maximum Lokomat speed ) amount BWS ( necessary ) individually determined separate day start study . Walking test terminate early relative absolute indication present reported American Heart Association patient unable continue walk . Patients ask consume food , alcohol , caffeine nicotine least 3 hour prior intervention , perform additional strenuous activity least 12 hour prior intervention . Walking session control time day . Before start study , demographic clinical characteristic collect CWS amount BWS ( necessary ) determine 10 minute walk test . At start walk condition , chest-carrying gas analysis system mouth mask ( Metamax 3B , Cortex , Germany ) , heart rate belt ( Polar H7 ) 2 wearable foot sensor ( Physiolog , Gait Up , Switzerland ) apply . Patients seat 5 minute rest value ( energy consumption , cardiorespiratory parameter perceive fatigue ) register . After rest period 5 minute , patient walk 30 minute energy consumption , cardiorespiratory parameter , perceive fatigue spatiotemporal parameter monitor continuously . Perceived fatigue register every minute . Average value rest , begin , middle end walking session calculate offline . Randomization Concealment . Walking session perform random order 3 separate day . An independent investigator assign 24 patient ( 2 series 12 ) random one 6 possible walk order use random sequence generator . Allocation conceal investigator use excel file blind lock section , independent investigator access . The random walk order patient therefore available patient recruit name enter excel sheet . This method assure investigator know walk order next participant . Dropout . In case subject drop , subject replace new participant perform three trial randomize order subject drop . So , case drop , additional patient test data 24 patient participate three condition collect . Statistical analysis . Statistics perform use SPSS ( IBM , Chicago , IL ) . Descriptive statistic calculate baseline demographic clinical patient characteristic . Repeated measure analyse variance ( ANOVA ) Bonferroni correction multiple comparison use analyze difference primary secondary outcome within walk condition . Regression analysis perform evaluate whether ( change ) spatiotemporal parameter predictive ( change ) energy consumption . The significance level set 5 % .</detailed_description>
