	<brief_summary>In England year 65,000 people fracture hip . Most patient elderly female fracture occur simple trip stumble . Approximately half fracture classify relationship hip joint capsule extracapsular . The majority fracture treat surgically internal fixation use , either plate screw ( slide hip screw ) nail screw ( intramedullary nail ) . Recent randomise study Peterborough involve 1000 patient indicate modest benefit treat type fracture intramedullary nail comparison slide hip screw . This study aim progress earlier study determine slightly thinner short intramedullary nail ( 175mm length ) , significant advantage disadvantage standard length ( 220mm ) intramedullary nail . Both implant use study routine use around world use within licenced indication . The study therefore use two different design implant within recommended area use , uncertainty best design .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial run close ideal trial methodology randomise trial specify CONSORT statement possible . This include secure randomisation , intention treat analysis , full reporting outcome clinical follow-up person blind prosthesis use . The trial follow code good clinical practice specify hospital trust Research Development Committee . In Peterborough hip fracture patient admit acute trauma ward transfer care Chief Investigator ( Mr Martyn Parker ( MJP ) ) . Those patient willing participant randomise trial consent prior surgery . Treatment follow standard evidence base protocol follow-up patient hip fracture clinic . A comprehensive database maintain patient contain audit research data . Included standardised assessment outcome .</detailed_description>
