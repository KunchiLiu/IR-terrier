	<brief_summary>The goal investigate effect single-port R3 sympathicotomy microvascular circulation affect finger . This effect analyse perform cool plethysmography nailfold capillary microscopy bilaterally , follow unilateral , single-port thoracoscopic sympathicotomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-port Thoracoscopic Sympathicotomy Treatment Raynaud 's Phenomenon , Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Raynaud 's phenomenon discoloration , discomfort numbness pain finger toe result excessively reduce blood flow due sympathetic induced vasospasms , response change temperature emotional stress . It usually affect multiple finger hand come frequent attack , little discomfort . Current treatment consist stepped-care , include preventive measure optimize digital blood flow , oral intravenous medical therapy aim improve microvascular circulation , surgical neuromodulation achieve vasodilatation neurostimulation . While surgical sympathectomy establish treatment Raynaud 's phenomenon , invasive nature prevent widespread application initial therapy . After introduction minimally invasive surgical technique recent year , investigator optimize endoscopic sympathicotomy procedure perform hyperhidrosis patient , need single 1 cm port detail , panoramic view sympathetic chain ( 1 ) . This minimal invasive technique proven safe , efficient reproducible treatment several indication seem also suitable Raynaud 's patient . In feasibility study , researcher want investigate effect single-port R3 sympathicotomy microvascular circulation affect finger . This effect analyse perform cool plethysmography nailfold capillary microscopy bilaterally , follow unilateral , single-port thoracoscopic sympathicotomy .</detailed_description>
