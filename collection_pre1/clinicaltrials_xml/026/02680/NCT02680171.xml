	<brief_summary>Spatial neglect common attention disorder right hemisphere stroke associate decreased independence quality life . Despite high prevalence stroke population , currently standard care treatment neglect . Prism adaptation ( PA ) promise rehabilitation technique , however incorporation clinical care limit likely due lack standardized procedure . The investigator develop computerized PA technique design well engage patient assist clinician . In study investigator aim evaluate feasibility effectiveness computerize PA procedure typical health care set , hypothesis PA procedure improve patient 's neglect symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Effectiveness Study Implementing Prism Adaptation Treatment Spatial Neglect After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There unmet need effective feasible intervention spatial neglect right hemisphere stroke . Neglect frequent problem stroke make difficult individual pay attention notice information come leave side world . Thus , often miss food leave side plate , fail wash groom leave side face body , run object leave side hall walk use wheelchair . Neglect associate slow recovery , reduce independence , long stay rehabilitation need resource discharge . The investigator develop novel simple computerized prism adaptation ( PA ) procedure treat neglect , investigators n't know yet whether feasible effective typical health care set . Thus , purpose project conduct randomize , control clinical trial , compare PA method control intervention treatment neglect . The investigator measure feasibility use clinical setting effectiveness term impairment ( i.e. , PA improve neglect symptom ? ) , activity ( i.e. , PA improve independence daily activity ) health care outcome ( i.e. , give PA shorten length stay decrease need resource discharge ? ) . By treat neglect PA , overall aim improve health care outcome neglect reduce need extend hospital care . A controlled , randomized design use present study . Patients randomly assign ( stratification relate neglect severity ) PA ( experimental ) sham ( control ) condition complete 10 , 30-minute intervention session approximately two week . These intervention session involve novel simple computerized prism adaptation , Peg-The-Mole ( PTM ) . Outcome measure collect treatment , well baseline , three month follow-up phone .</detailed_description>
