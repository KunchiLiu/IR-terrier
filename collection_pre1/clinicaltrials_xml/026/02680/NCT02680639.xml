	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) major cause chronic morbidity mortality throughout world , fourth lead cause death world . COPD disease result vary degree dyspnea , shortness breath . Spirometry method diagnose COPD presence post bronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict value combination FEV1 / FVC &lt; 70 % . This would confirm presence airflow limitation fully reversible . The presence airflow limitation identify one main cause dyspnea patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( 1 ) . Expiratory Flow Limitation ( EFL ) occur airways become compressed usually result pressure outside airway exceed pressure inside airway . As airflow obstruction worsens , EFL appear much low flow give lung volume become present rest least develops early exercise ( 2 ) . Early detection EFL consist either invasive balloon catheterization relatively complex plethysmographic technique . An alternative approach , one use study , involve utilize Forced Oscillation Technique ( FOT ) . Alternatively High Frequency Oscillations ( HFO ) show effectively low CO2 level , traditionally require intubation trans tracheal catheter . Treatment specialize noninvasive ventilator possible propose therapy augment application optimize EPAP splint open low airway order increase diffusive capability high frequency oscillation low alveolar region . There approximately 25 million hypercapnic patient EFL could benefit therapy . High frequency oscillation integrate specialized noninvasive ventilator advantage low cost solution significantly low medical risk . In addition , high frequency oscillation use low pressure achieve effective therapy mean less chance barotrauma great patient acceptance . This study enroll subject screen visit . Screening include physical exam vital sign , pregnancy test ( applicable ) , questionnaire , pulse oximetry , measure carbon dioxide level , determination EFL auto- Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure ( EPAP ) ventilator , spirometry . If patient eligible tolerates procedure , ask complete home-based sleep study prior visit 2 . Alice Night One/ Alice PDX portable home sleep test device record information breathing . At visit 2 participant monitor continuously via 3 lead EKG , oxygen saturation pulse oximetry ( SPO2 ) , Carbon Dioxide concentration ( TcCO2 ) monitor , RespiTrace belt ventilator data . During Visit 2 , participant first undergo repeat optimal EPAP determination trial 3 different session High Frequency Oscillation ( HFO ) therapy 20 minute least 10 minute wash period session allow participant 's CO2 stabilize return baseline . The order session randomize patient . Participants place semi-recumbent position wear nasal CPAP mask session . A TcCO2 monitor patch place skin ( forehead area ) collect carbon dioxide measurements session . A RespiTrace belt place participant ' chest wall measure chest wall diaphragmatic excursion session . A 3 lead EKG also use monitor cardiac activity session .</detailed_description>
