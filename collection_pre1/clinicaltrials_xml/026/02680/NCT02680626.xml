	<brief_title>Bilateral Transversus Abdominis Plane Block With Without Magnesium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total abdominal hysterectomy ( TAH ) without salpingo-oophorectomy commonly perform major surgical procedure result significant postoperative pain . Traditionally , pain treat multimodal approach include opioids , often administer via patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pump . Common side effect opioids include sedation , nausea , vomit , constipation , pruritus . Thus , overcome undesirable side effect , approach pain management explore , include post-operative transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block . TAP block popular analgesia technique abdominal surgery incision sixth thoracic ( T10 ) vertebra first lumbar ( L1 ) vertebra . The block involve infiltration local anesthetic ( LA ) anesthesiologist direct ultrasound guidance . The anesthetic deposit plane internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle , contain thoracolumbar nerve originate T6 L1 spinal root . These nerve supply sensation anterolateral abdominal wall , area responsible incision-related pain follow TAH ± unilateral/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy . TAP block low risk procedure rare side-effects include bowel peritoneum perforation , local anesthetic toxicity . Almost anesthesiologist familiar perform block , routinely do ultrasound guidance minimize risk perforation . Previous study demonstrate TAP block efficacy various abdominal surgery include hysterectomy , colon resection , Caesarean section , retropubic prostatectomy , laparoscopic cholecystectomy , open appendectomy . While TAP block show provide patient statistically significant increase time first analgesic request , mean delay typically le 3 hour . To overcome limited duration action , propose addition magnesium adjunct LA solution infiltrate block . Other regional anesthesia technique trialed various adjunct include epinephrine , dexamethasone , clonidine , recently magnesium . The goal use adjunct prolong enhance analgesia , potentially even decrease total LA require . Our study investigate use magnesium adjunct LA bilateral TAP block increase duration analgesia . Magnesium fourth abundant cation body second abundant intracellular cation potassium . The minimum recommend daily intake magnesium adult 0.25 mmol ( 6 mg ) /kg body weight . Magnesium natural analgesic antagonism N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor . When added LA , magnesium show improve quality duration analgesia neuraxial , femoral , brachial plexus block . In fact , brachial plexus analgesia produce magnesium sulfate ( MgSO4 ) alone . Magnesium adjunct TAP block never previously investigate setting , thus propose study specifically investigate potential effect prolong analgesia patient undergo elective TAH ± unilateral bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy . We hypothesize quality duration analgesia improve add moderate amount MgSO4 local anesthetic use TAP block .</detailed_description>
