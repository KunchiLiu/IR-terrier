	<detailed_description>The list medication prolong QT interval provoke torsade de pointes keep expand . This list include antiarrhythmic drug , also medication cardiac indication ( like several antibiotic , antihistamine antipsychotic medication ) . All medication prolong QT interval block specific potassium channel myocardial cell membrane : channel rapid component delay rectifier potassium current `` IKr '' . The risk develop torsade de point patient take medication IKr blockade capability vary &gt; 4 % antiarrhythmic drug &lt; 0.01 % non-cardiac medication . The risk depend strength IKr blockade , also specific patient characteristic . In fact , majority patient develop torsade de pointes non-cardiac medication identifiable risk factor . In regard , patient congenital long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) prone develop torsade de pointes treat QT-prolonging medication . This , due genetically defective ion channel , patient LQTS impair ventricular repolarization reduce `` repolarization reserve . '' Therefore , common medical practice strongly advise patient congenital LQTS avoid medication IKr channel blocker capability . Zitron et al report flavonoid contain pink-grapefruit juice block IKr channel . These investigator also report drink 1 liter pink-grapefruit juice cause QT prolongation healthy volunteer . The magnitude QT prolongation provoke grapefruit juice small ( 12.5 Â± 4.2 msec ) . However , drug cause minor QT prolongation healthy volunteer may provoke major QT prolongation rare sick individual risk develop torsade de pointes . Consequently , one could argue , proven otherwise , pink-grapefruit add list `` drug '' forbidden patient LQTS . This single center , open-label , randomize , crossover study . Subjects admit cardiology department day first dose remain study completion . After perform baseline electrocardiogram baseline blood test ( Complete Blood Count , chemistry - 10 ml blood ) subject continuously record Holter monitor 24 hour ( baseline Holter ) . On next day subject randomly divide two experimental therapy ( one random order group patient</detailed_description>
