	<brief_summary>The purpose study find blood plasma base biomarkers disease progression neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) . NF1 associate development benign cutaneous tumor well variety malignancy . Analysis plasma DNA chemical composition may provide tool diagnosis follow-up NF1 . The hypothesis study NF1-associated tumor burden malignant transformation tumor detect plasma . To test hypothesis , Finnish patient NF1 recruit blood sample take . Blood plasma separate analyze chemically . DNA also extract quantified .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Plasma Diagnosis Follow-up Neurofibromatosis Type 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) dominant hereditary multiorgan disease cause benign cutaneous neurofibroma malignant tumor . Timely detection malignant transformation NF1 tumor great clinical importance . Also method easily monitor individual 's overall tumor burden would useful . Blood plasma collect NF1 patient age- gender-matched control . The sample store -80 C analysis . Free circulate plasma DNA extract quantified use commercial reagent . Also previously describe chemical detection method observe overall change plasma composition utilize . The analysis result compare NF1 patient healthy control , also correlate NF1 tumor burden diagnosis malignancy five-year follow-up .</detailed_description>
