	<brief_title>Dasatinib Combination With Chemotherapy Relapsed Refractory Core Binding Factor Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I study child adolescent acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) come back ( relapse ) become resistant ( refractory ) standard therapy . Researchers want know drug call dasatinib safe use together standard chemotherapy treat patient relapse resistant AML . Their leukemia particular genetic mutation , call core-binding factor . This type leukemia increase cancer promote protein call c-KIT . Dasatinib target protein laboratory experiment . Laboratory study suggest dasatinib may prevent acute myeloid leukemia cell grow may lead destruction leukemia cell . The main goal study find safe dose dasatinib find side effect dasatinib give combination standard chemotherapy child adolescent . Similar study currently do adult patient . Dasatinib proven safe effective treatment type leukemia , combination standard chemotherapy . It , however , FDA-approved use child . Three six participant receive start dose drug . If side effect severe , next group participant take study drug high dose level . Up two dose level study drug test . Dasatinib give mouth daily day 6 29 42-day cycle . Participants may receive two cycle study . In addition dasatinib , participant receive chemotherapy intravenously ( IV ) fludarabine , cytarabine , idarubicin , well spinal fluid ( intrathecal IT chemotherapy ) . Intrathecal chemotherapy include cytarabine start cycle . These drug part standard AML treatment . If time study entry subject leukemia cell spinal fluid ( CNS leukemia ) , may receive additional intrathecal chemotherapy cytarabine , methotrexate , hydrocortisone ( IT triple ) cycle . Required research test include pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) blood draw ( 1 teaspoon time ) cycle 1 . Optional research test include extra marrow ( 1 teaspoon time ) genetic test banking marrow ( 1 teaspoon ) future study cancer . Primary Objectives study : - To evaluate safety combine dasatinib reinduction chemotherapy comprise idarubicin , fludarabine cytarabine ( Ida - FLU/Ara ) child relapse refractory core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia ( CBF AML ) - To characterize toxicity profile combination pediatric patient relapse refractory CBF AML Secondary Objectives study : - To estimate response rate combination chemotherapy context Phase I study , child AML first great relapse refractory induction chemotherapy - To determine genotype c-KIT exon 8 17 correlate response rate - To characterize c-KIT expression bone marrow blast study entry end course 1 therapy describe correlation response therapy Exploratory Objectives : - To investigate descriptively pharmacodynamic modulation c-KIT target , Stat3 , cell line patient-derived plasma - To perform RNA sequence bone marrow sample study entry order describe prevalence mutation AML associate gene , include c-KIT , correlate descriptively progression free survival - To collect biology specimen study entry completion therapy future biology study</detailed_description>
