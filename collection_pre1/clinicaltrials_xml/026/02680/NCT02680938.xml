	<brief_summary>The third stage interval delivery infant delivery placenta . This stage average 10 minute consider prolonged last longer 30 minute , placental separation occur result continued uterine contraction , continue contraction control blood loss compression spiral artery also result migration placenta low uterine segment cervix . The intra-umbilical vein injection 10 IU oxytocin recommend first line treatment retain placenta . Despite recommendation , method yet make way routine practice , probably lack large substantive randomize controlled trial , linger doubt uterotonic use dosage . The purpose study evaluate effect intraumbilical vein injection oxytocin reduce duration third stage labor need manual delivery placenta , , addition reduce blood loss third fourth stage labor decrease incidence rtained placenta comparison inraumblical injection normal saline . This prospective randomize control trial conduct Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital . This study include 240 term pregnant woman labor admit labor ward , They divide Two group : Group ( A ) : The experimental group , 10 unit oxytocin injected umbilical vein proximal site placenta clamp cut umbilical cord . Group ( B ) : The control group , 1 mL normal saline inject umbilical vein proximal site placenta clamp cut umbilical cord .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study include 240 term pregnant woman labor admit labor ward , They divide Two group : Group ( A ) : The experimental group , 10 unit oxytocin injected umbilical vein proximal site placenta clamp cut umbilical cord . Group ( B ) : The control group , 1 mL normal saline inject umbilical vein proximal site placenta clamp cut umbilical cord . complete blood count group 12 h delivery . - The third stage labor actively manage two group infusion 20 IU oxytocin 1 L Ringer 's lactate solution rate 100 mL/min , immediately delivery fetus ( Nankali et al. , 2013 ) .. - In control group ( B ) , 1 mL normal saline inject umbilical vein proximal site placenta clamp cut umbilical cord . - In experimental group ( A ) , instead normal saline , 10 IU ( 1mL ) oxytocin inject site . We wait 30 min symptom placenta delivery ( i.e. , uterus become firm globular displace upward , gush blood occur , umbilical cord elongate ) . - Spontaneous delivery placenta achieve touch fundus apply pressure symphysis pubis finger slight traction umbilical cord . - For participant , duration third stage labor ( time period delivery fetus delivery placenta ) record . - The two group compare follow term : 1 . The duration third stage labor stopwatch . 2 . Hemoglobin ( Hb ) difference 12 h delivery . 3 . The need manual delivery placenta . Manual removal placenta commonly carry general sedation operating room , placenta deliver 30 min fetal delivery . 4 . Estimate blood loss Allowable Blood Loss ( ABL ) ( Miller 2000 )</detailed_description>
