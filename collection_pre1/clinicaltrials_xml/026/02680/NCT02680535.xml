	<brief_title>MRI/US Fusion Imaging Biopsy Combination With Nanoparticle Directed Focal Therapy Ablation Prostate Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center , single-dose study AuroLase Therapy focal ablation neoplastic prostate tissue via nanoparticle direct irradiation . The patient population consist men low intermediate risk localize prostate cancer MRI visible confirm focal area prostate cancer use MR US Fusion Guided Biopsy . The patient also disease detect via ultrasound guide biopsy outside area visualize MR imaging.There one arm/group study : Up forty five ( 45 ) patient receive single intravenous infusion AuroShell particles 12 36 hour prior MRI/US guide laser irradiation use FDA clear laser interstitial optical fiber . Efficacy acute volume ablation assess contrast-enhanced MRI 48 - 72 hour laser illumination allow time appearance coagulative necrosis prior reconfiguration tissue lytic action . An appearance 'void ' MRI would generally expect lesion shrinkage . Efficacy focal ablation prostate tissue assess MRI /Ultrasound guide biopsy 3 month ( primary endpoint ) 1 year laser treatment . Per standard care patient follow continue 6 month basis beyond one year follow outside scope study .</detailed_description>
