	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Oral Ferric Maltol Compared Intravenous Iron To Treat Iron Deficiency Anaemia IBD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase 3b , randomize , control , multicentre study oral ferric maltol intravenous iron ( FCM ) , treatment iron deficiency anaemia subject inflammatory bowel disease . Approximately 242 eligible subject randomise ( 1:1 ) receive one follow treatment duration study treatment period ( 52 week ) : - Oral ferric maltol , 30 mg capsule bid . - Intravenous iron ( ferric carboxy maltose ) per SPC In FCM arm IV iron treatment repeat subject iron deficient study visit . Subject participation study consist 3 period : - Screening : Up 14 day - Randomised Treatment : 52 week - Post-treatment safety follow-up : 14 day study medication discontinuation Primary efficacy safety ferric maltol Intravenous iron ( ferric carboxy maltose ) evaluate first 12 week . End study evaluation occur Week 52 premature discontinuation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All following criterion must meet randomize subject study : 1 . Subjects must competent understand information give Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve informed consent form must sign date inform consent prior study mandated procedure 2 . Subjects must willing able comply study requirement 3 . Age ≥ 18 year 4 . Subjects must confirm diagnosis IBD ( endoscopic and/or biopsy ) 5 . Subjects must document intolerance oral ferrous product , consider suitable oral ferrous product , would consider Investigator suitable intravenous iron treatment 6 . Subjects must iron deficiency anaemia define follow criterion : 1 . Hb ≥8.0 g/dL &lt; 11.0 g/dL woman OR Hb ≥8.0 g/dL &lt; 12.0 g/dL men 2 . AND Ferritin &lt; 30ng/ml OR Ferritin &lt; 100 ng/ml WITH Transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) &lt; 20 % . 7 . Female subject childbearing potential ( include perimenopausal female menstrual period within 1 year prior screen ) must agree use reliable method contraception study completion least 4 week follow final study visit . Reliable contraception define method result low failure rate , i.e. , less 1 % per year use consistently correctly , implant , injectables , intrauterine contraceptive device ( IUDs ) , complete sexual abstinence , vasectomized partner . Oral contraceptive medication allow study . Female subject surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy ) postmenopausal ( defined menstrual period within 1 year screening ) also allow participate . A subject meet follow criterion eligible participation study . 1 . Subject anaemia due cause iron deficiency , include , limited , 1 . Untreated untreatable severe malabsorption syndrome 2 . Immunosuppressant use . Immunosuppressants take stable dose 3 month prior randomisation expect stay stable throughout study treatment period permit long clinical evidence suspicion immunosuppressant contribute subject 's anaemia . 2 . Subject receive prior screen 1 . Within 8 week intramuscular intravenous ( IV ) iron administration depot iron preparation 2 . Within 2 week blood transfusion 3 . Oral iron supplementation , take specifically treat anaemia , within previous 4 week ( Over Counter ( OTC ) multivitamins contain iron permit ) 3 . Subjects active inflammatory bowel disease define SCCAI ( Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index ) score great 5 Screening CDAI ( Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ) score great 300 Screening period ( assessed use Screening haematocrit ( HCT ) CDAI diary card complete subject 7 day prior plan randomization ) . 4 . Subject know hypersensitivity allergy either active substance excipients ferric maltol capsule ferric carboxymaltose solution IV administration . 5 . Subjects serious adverse reaction previous dos ferric carboxy maltose ( FCM ) . 6 . Subjects contraindication treatment iron preparation , e.g . hemochromatosis , chronic hemolytic disease , sideroblastic anaemia , thalassemia , lead intoxication induce anaemia . 7 . Subjects vitamin B12 folic acid deficiency determine central laboratory screen result clinical opinion investigator . Subjects may start vitamin B12 folate replacement rescreen least 2 week . 8 . Subjects pregnant breast feeding . 9 . Concomitant medical condition significant active bleeding likely initiate prolong anaemia . 10 . Participation interventional clinical study within 30 day prior screen . 11 . Subject cardiovascular , liver , renal , haematologic , gastrointestinal , immunologic , endocrine , metabolic , central nervous system disease , opinion Investigator , may adversely affect safety subject severely limit lifespan subject ( i.e . unlikely complete full duration study ) . 12 . Subject significant neurologic psychiatric symptom result disorientation , memory impairment , inability report accurately might interfere treatment compliance , study conduct interpretation result ( e.g. , Alzheimer 's disease , schizophrenia psychosis , active current alcohol drug abuse ) . 13 . Subject inmate psychiatric ward , prison , state institution . 14 . Subject Investigator team member involve directly indirectly conduct clinical study . 15 . Subjects severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min ) . ( US )</criteria>
