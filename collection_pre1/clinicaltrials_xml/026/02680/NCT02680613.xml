	<detailed_description>Introduction : Cervical cancer lead cause cancer-related death Tanzania . The age-adjusted incidence rate estimate 54 case per 100,000 ( IARC , 2012 ) 80 % Tanzanian woman affect cervical cancer die due advance stage diagnosis ( Kahesa , et al. , 2012 ) . Visual Inspection cervix Acetic Acid ( VIA ) effective alternative Pap smear , unavailable low-resource country due weak health system ( Palanuwong , 2007 ) . Nurses typically receive 6 day train return community provide VIA ; however , often face total lack oversight ensure provide quality screen cryotherapy . This lack quality control prevent decline cervical cancer morbidity mortality despite significant investment implementation VIA program . The Kilimanjaro Cervical Cancer Screening Project ( KCCP ) pilot study 1000 woman develop test cervicography ( take digital photo cervix ) training method use smartphone camera hand nurse perform cervical cancer screen receive 'real time ' mentorship close user group image transfer guidance cervicographers locate elsewhere Tanzania . A pilot study complete February 2015 show method provide safe high quality screen method move implementation scale within multiple VIA program late 2015 ( Yeates et al. , Manuscript preparation ) . The KCCP continue screen patient provide significant opportunity perform research inform scale-up program . Measures encourage increase uptake cervical cancer screen region , many low-resource context drastically need reduce burden cervical cancer context . The prevalence screen Kilimanjaro 6 % ( Cunningham et al , 2015 ) , close WHO figure 5 % woman develop country screen last five year ( World Health Organization , 1986 ) . The large perceived barrier cervical cancer screen Kilimanjaro region find lack knowledge screening service available woman anticipate would able afford cost associate screen , include travel ( Cunningham et al , 2015 ) . Objectives : A ) To determine attitude , barrier enablers towards smartphone cervicography ensure accessible , culturally relevant smartphone cervicography screen program B ) To evaluate impact voucher return transportation towards increase cervical cancer screen attendance C ) To evaluate impact motivational text message towards increase cervical cancer screen attendance Methodology : This study comprise descriptive cross-sectional survey randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Household survey , capture baseline characteristic , use stratify systematic random sample urban rural area use recruit participant RCT . Cross-sectional survey participant recruit opportunistically screen clinic associate study . Participants randomize one three arm . The first arm control group receive correspondence . The second arm receive series motivational text message , include screen date location . The third group receive travel voucher code via SMS motivational text message content second group . A post-screening survey conduct follow cervical cancer screen clinic participate study evaluate screen attendance attitude towards smartphone digital cervicography .</detailed_description>
