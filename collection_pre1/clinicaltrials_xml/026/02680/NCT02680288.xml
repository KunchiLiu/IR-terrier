	<detailed_description>Background Serotonin ( 5-HT ) one three brain monoamine widely distribute brain play important role affect goal-directed behavior . Limbic structure underlie behavior motivate palatable food drug abuse receive dense projection brainstem serotonergic nucleus . In rat , light sound cue associate access cocaine strongly stimulate drug-seeking behavior . Agonists type 2C serotonergic receptor ( 5-HT₂cR ) attenuate responding.8 Drug taking ( cocaine self-administration ) also attenuate 5-HT₂cR agonist dos similar decrease food-reinforced responding cause reduction locomotor activity . Lorcaserin novel selective agonist 5-HT₂cR recently approve FDA weight loss therapy . It act selectively receptor subtype minimal activation 5-HT₂ᴀR 5-HT₂ᴃR receptor . Based initial clinical study lead approval , lorcaserin well tolerate probably cause cardiac valve disease serious side effect . Even , give potential serious adverse event , FDA limit use patient either obese overweight medical complication hypertension . Whether lorcaserin become generally accepted long-term treatment obesity depend result ongoing post-marketing study cardiovascular outcome data . Rationale In preclinical study , agonists 5-HT₂cR potently attenuate cocaine-seeking behavior . Lorcaserin recently approve selective 5-HT₂cR agonist acceptable safety profile human . No published study report effect cocaine-induced crave drug-reinforced responding human . Specific Aims : 1 . Evaluate whether lorcaserin treatment attenuates positive subjective effect cocaine drug-reinforced behavior . 2 . Determine whether active treatment modifies cocaine- script- induced craving . Methods This randomize , cross-over , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-center , multiple-panel evaluation potential oral lorcaserin modify cocaine self-administration laboratory setting . Up 32 non-treatment-seeking , regular cocaine user receive treatment single dose oral placebo , lorcaserin 10 mg ( Panel 1 ) , lorcaserin 20 mg ( Panel 2 ) . Script-guided imagery autobiographical memory develop base experience related cocaine use , anger , neutral event . Following treatment lorcaserin , script-induced emotional state assay . Sampling dos cocaine ( 0.0 , 0.23 , 0.46 mg/kg ) administer , participant choose self-administering additional intravenous dos receive monetary alternative . Detailed measure negative positive subjective effect intravenous infusion also make . As noncontingent infusion cocaine administer , pharmacokinetics cocaine lorcaserin determine .</detailed_description>
