	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis skin disorder itchy , red skin rash . This may certain protein increase skin AD patient . The increased expression protein play important role development AD may increase risk person AD get skin infection allergy . There non-invasive way diagnose monitor development progression atopic dermatitis . The goal study develop laboratory test , do skin sample collect tapy stripping , use early detection monitoring response treatment variety skin disease , include atopic dermatitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Epidermal Signatures Patients With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) highly pruritic , chronic inflammatory skin disease affect 25 % child 10 % adult . Atopic skin disease associate significant morbidity well physical , psychological , economical quality-of-life impairment . The economical impact AD requirement family support extraordinary may great typically find asthma type I diabetes , respectively . In many patient , early onset AD first clinical manifestation allergic disease often trigger atopic march , subsequent development food allergy , allergic rhinitis , asthma . The skin AD patient characterize increased Th2 axis , cellular infiltration significant epithelial inflammation . These factor permit increase penetration invade allergen pathogen drive AD pathogenesis pruritus ( itch ) . Approximately 90 % AD patient colonize S. aureus , 5 - 30 % non-atopic individual colonize . Novel therapeutic approach currently clinical trial provide opportunity target pathways integral AD disease pathogenesis . In recent year , show AD heterogeneous initially perceive . Since novel therapeutic target different pathway , one therapeutic approach may work AD patient therapy may provide different level clinical benefit . Additionally , since AD manifest primarily skin , blood collection analysis may indicative measurement determine therapy best patient . Despite improved understanding AD , validate method non-invasively diagnose monitor development progression AD sorely lack . Additionally , non-invasive method need understand inflammation site disease manifestation potentially identify biological pathway relevant give patient . This allow personalized approach treatment patient AD . The investigator hypothesize skin protein differentially express upper layer disease versus non-disease skin tissue may use biomarkers skin change link development AD . Previously method compare expression skin proteins extract protein tape strip evaluate difference use mass spectrometry-based proteomics develop . This non-invasive method suitable use AD patient use show increase specific skin protein AD patient versus normal control . Despite success , additional study need compare gene protein expression obtain tape strip genomic proteomic profile full thickness skin whole blood . This propose study determine validity use non-invasive tape stripping , surrogate skin biopsy whole blood collection , identify inflammatory pathway up-regulated give AD patient . This information use define biomarkers facilitate personalize medicine approach use emerge novel therapeutic .</detailed_description>
