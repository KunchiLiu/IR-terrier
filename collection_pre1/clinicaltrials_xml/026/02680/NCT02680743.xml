	<brief_summary>Objective : Congenital cytomegalovirus ( cCMV ) common non-genetic cause pediatric sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL ) important cause neurodevelopmental delay . Infants cCMV symptomatic , asymptomatic , asymptomatic except hear loss . Symptomatic infant may readily identify quickly refer intervention may present classic common clinical finding , majority infant ( 85-90 % ) cCMV asymptomatic birth classic clinical , laboratory , radiologic finding therefore often delay identification intervention . Often , otherwise asymptomatic infant cCMV may early congenital hearing loss therefore fail newborn hearing screen specifically identify cCMV delay seek audiology exam treatment CMV infection . The overall objective propose research investigate test newborn congenital cytomegalovirus infection ( cCMV ) fail newborn hearing screen improve early identification cCMV infection therefore reduce delay referral newborn appropriate specialist intervention . Eligibility Criteria : Eligible participant include newborn NBN NICU le 14 day life fail standard hearing screening . Interventions Evaluations Saliva sample obtain participate infant mouth swab accord establish protocol . The saliva test CMV qualitative polymerase chain reaction ARUP Laboratories . Infants test positive CMV infection refer repeat audiology exam confirm hear loss Pediatric Infectious Diseases evaluation treatment necessary . Parents guardians infant test positive cCMV receive counsel importance follow specialist . The primary outcome measure cCMV prevalence data time referral intervention . Follow : Follow-up clinically indicate determine infant 's primary care provider , pediatric infectious disease physician , audiologist . It determine study , referral service study endpoint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Establish cCMV test protocol demonstrate protocol successful identifying infant cCMV present hearing abnormality first sign infection . Specific Aim 2 : Demonstrate majority infant test positive cCMV time fail hear screen refer within 14 day appropriate confirmatory test treatment . Specific Aim 3 : Improve cCMV prevalence data estimate State Nebraska . Congenital cytomegalovirus ( cCMV ) affect 20,000-40,000 infant United States annually common congenital viral infection newborns1 . cCMV common non-genetic cause sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL ) child estimate 1 10 child SNHL cCMV relate hearing loss . SNHL common sequela cCMV infection overall disease burden much great cCMV important contributor neurodevelopmental delay2 . The common physical exam finding identification cCMV include petechia , hepatosplenomegaly , microcephaly , hypotonia , hear loss , purpura , chorioretinitis , seizure activity common laboratory finding include elevate AST ALT , thrombocytopenia , conjugate hyperbilirubinemia , elevate CSF protein3,4 . Infants may also identify base radiologic abnormality include abnormal cranial ultrasound , head CT , brain MRI may show cerebral calcification ventriculomegaly4 . Infants cCMV infection categorize either symptomatic asymptomatic base physical exam , laboratory , radiologic finding present birth3 . Approximately 10 % -15 % cCMV case classify symptomatic due clinical finding outcomes infant poor approximately half suffer severe neurologic sequela include SNHL , mental retardation IQs &lt; 70 , microcephaly2,3 . Approximately 85-90 % child cCMV clinical finding birth therefore consider asymptomatic3.However , case otherwise asymptomatic cCMV hearing loss detect newborn hear test screening patient fall sub-categorization asymptomatic fail hear screening.The hearing loss cCMV significant often severe profound symptomatic asymptomatic case . In asymptomatic child hear impairment , 42 % require amplification rehabilitation2 . There currently universal systematic screening newborn cCMV symptomatic infant may test CMV due clinical suspicion , asymptomatic infant present great challenge early identification . Screening technique available include urine saliva culture without PCR , well blood PCR run dry blood sample ( i.e . blood obtain part statewide newborn screen exam ) 2 . Recent study show CMV PCR assay liquid dry saliva sample high sensitivity specificity compare saliva cultures5 . Although test available , routinely use neonatal universal screen either fail hearing screen even though know detect hearing loss early lead early intervention therefore well long term hearing developmental outcomes , especially infant treat antiviral therapy ganciclovir valgancyclovir2,6 . Birth data collect Nebraska Medicine ( include Bellevue ) 2014 show 2,660 birth 2,592 infant pass hear screen 43 ( 1.6 % ) infant refer There system place track many child fail test , many test cCMV , many diagnose cCMV . The Nebraska Birth Defects Registry , maintain Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) , sparse data number baby identify cCMV go back 2007 data follow : 2 case 2007 , 2 2009 , 1 2011 , 1 2013 . The mechanism registry receive data birth certificate clerk entry data certainly complete.In order treat cCMV valgancyclovir diagnosis cCMV must make within 14 day birth treatment initiate 30 day life ; timeframe currently feasible majority infant currently identify current status quo follow-up hearing evaluation perform week sometimes month initial referral newborn hearing screen . With project intend institute test CMV infant fail newborn hearing screen order quickly identify cCMV . After identification , refer audiology test refer Pediatric Infectious Diseases diagnostic confirmatory test treatment indicate . Additionally , confirm positive cCMV test , parent PCP receive additional counseling importance proper follow early intervention specialist order improve infant long-term outcome . A secondary benefit improve data cCMV prevalence Nebraska .</detailed_description>
