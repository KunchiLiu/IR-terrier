	<brief_title>Functional Outcome Analgesia TKA : Radiofrequency vs Continuous Adductor Canal Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study compare efficacy two analgesia technique patient undergo Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) functional recovery pain control : Pulsed Continuous Radiofrequency ( PRF TRF ) apply respectively saphenous nerve genicular nerve knee ( femoral sciatic branch ) compare Continuous adductor canal block local anesthetic ( CACB ) . The Null Hypothesis difference exist functional recovery , pain medication consumption postoperative exercise physical performance two group patient submit TKA two different modality analgesia . To test null hypothesis hypothesize clinically relevant : - reduction 30 % time need perform Timed Up Go test 2 day surgery - reduction 30 % pain medication consumption first 24 ore surgery . To test null Hypothesis , 40 patient need ( 20 group ) . The primary outcome measure : - time require two group ( CACB-group RF-group ) perform Timed-Up Go ( TUG ) test second postoperative day ( POD2 ) . TUG measure time person take rise chair , walk three meter , turn around , walk back chair , sit . During test , person expect use mobility aid would normally require . - total morphine consumption mean patient-controlled analgesia pump first 24-h surgery , measure precisely record dose deliver PCA pump . With alpha error 0.05 , power 80 % standard deviation 7 mg morphine consumption per 24 h , 20 patient ( 10 group ) require study detect mean difference 10 mg morphine two group Secondary outcome measure include : Pain evaluation use VAS rest , VAS walk knee flexion ; functional outcome evaluation 6 min walk test , degree knee flexion , Scores obtain self-assessment questionaire ( WOMAC-Western Ontario McMaster University questionaire knee osteoarthritis CHAMPS-Community Healthy Activities Model Program Seniors ) . These value compare baseline value record surgery . It hypothesize PRF TRF saphenous nerve genicular nerve knee joint improve early late functional recovery pain control TKA compare CACB</detailed_description>
