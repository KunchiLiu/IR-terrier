	<detailed_description>Abstract : An increased susceptibility bacterial viral infection hallmark explain study rationale , primary immunodeficiency ( PID ) . The common PID require treatment Ig replacement ( SCIg IVIg ) Common Variable Immune Deficiency ( CVID ) , diagnose presence hypogammaglobulinemia plus defective response vaccine antigen . Prior diagnosis , CVID patient oftentimes develop autoimmunity require immunosuppression cancer require chemotherapy . Unfortunately , difficulty arise make diagnosis CVID adult treat immunosuppressive drug , steroid , chemotherapy , prevent timely use Ig replacement therapy patient . Furthermore , CVID difficult diagnose young child . Exome sequence genetic method thus far fail identify monogenic cause CVID method result many `` hit '' specifically validate . At time , patient derangement signal pathway include STAT1 , STAT3 , PI3K , others CVID , suggest examine signal pathway , could find consistent sign CVID . The Investigators propose use broad , new screen develop PI study functional defect human immune response CVID . Using time -- -- flight mass cytometry ( CyTOF ) phospho-specific antibody , investigator simultaneously examine major signal pathway circulate innate adaptive immune cell type identify abnormal phosphorylation signal molecule response variety canonical stimulus . This method innovative identifies signal defect immune response insensitive chemotherapy immunosuppression , signal response examine biologically upstream immunosuppressed target . Our approach generate new `` signaling fingerprint '' facilitate diagnosis CVID . Our proposal also impactful , knowledge gain functional defect CVID , combine whole exome sequencing , improve general understand human immune response infection . There two major aim : 1 ) study healthy control subject across variety age comparison CVID patient , furthermore generate new information immune signaling response change age , currently unknownÍ¾ 2 ) study CVID patient identify consistent aberrant signal response allow acceleration diagnosis treatment . Design study : The investigator propose observational , case -- control study single blood draw among two cohort , patient CVID healthy control . Methods : Fifty ( 50 ) CVID patient ( adult child ) consent Dr. Butte 's Immunology Clinic Stanford , healthy control ( 100 ) , adult pediatric primary care clinic Stanford . There one blood draw 2 mL blood analyze immediately Stanford 's establish phospho-CyTOF protocol Human Immune Monitoring Core facility Stanford . This screen examine phosphorylation circulate immune cell type ( CD4 CD8 T cell , B cell , NK cell , monocyte , macrophage , neutrophil , eosinophil , DCs ) . Whole blood subject control aliquotted portion , portion stimulate either cytokine , TLR agonists , anti-TCR anti-BCR antibody , PMA , leave unstimulated . Treated cell surface stain , fix , permeabilized , stain intracellularly 12 signal phospho-proteins , analyze CyTOF , enable measurement 50 parameter simultaneously . Data analyze FlowJo CytoBank software , statistical analysis R .</detailed_description>
