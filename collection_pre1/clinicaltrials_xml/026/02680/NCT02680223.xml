	<brief_title>Efficacy Coloured Overlays Lenses Reading Difficulty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants adult age 18 30 year , symptom visual stress ( discomfort read experience perceptual symptom read letter move distort ) diagnose read difficulty ( dyslexia ) . Participants recruit City University London optometry clinic City University London Learning Success unit . Participants within age range visual stress eligible participate . Potential participant ocular systemic condition possible impact vision ( e.g . amblyopia diabetes respectively ) intellectual disability exclude study . Each potential participant undergo eye examination prior participation , follow test conduct : Prior study entry : History symptom Direct ophthalmoscopy ( check ocular abnormality ) Retinoscopy subjective refraction ( quantify correct uncorrected refractive error ) Cover test ( look eye misalignment ) Baseline test study entry : Each eligible participant agrees take part study undergo test coloured overlay , determine whether particular overlay appear beneficial term reduce difficulty discomfort reading . If , participant provide overlay use period two week , determine whether consistently beneficial reading period . In addition , Wilkins Rate Reading Test ( WRRT ) carry baseline stage without overlay . Follow-up test 1 : The participant attend appointment two week time point , overlay beneficial , addition test carry use Intuitive Colorimeter , determine exact hue , saturation intensity colour lenses offer relief difficulty discomfort read . Once colour determine , hue modify find close colour participant first lose benefit ( point discomfort difficulty return ) . Each colour setting ( beneficial non-beneficial ) note participant provide spectacle lens tint exactly one colour specification . In crossover design , order true control lenses provide participant determine random number generation . Allocation carry personnel researcher study , know order ( true lens tint first second ) 1 2 . Ordering tinted spectacle handle personnel researcher study , information accessible researcher . Thus , tint lens order share researcher , know whether participant wear beneficial non-beneficial tint , mask . Similarly , participant unaware whether wear true control tint , time participation . The non-beneficial tint similar beneficial tint , neither researcher participant able determine . On occasion participant also ask describe difficulty he/she experience read without colour overlay . Follow-up test 2 : After one month wear first pair tint lens , read speed measure first pair tint lens , participant ask experience reading difficulty wear glass . The participant ask spend one week without tinted lens , return visit week . After period , second pair tint lens provide , worn month . Follow-up test 3 : Reading speed measure second pair tint lens participant ask experience reading difficulty wear glass . Statistical analysis The main outcome measure rate read provide two reading test , two tint lens type , overlay , without tint . These quantitative test result compare two group use unpaired t-test , within individual ( baseline follow-up test ) use repeat measure analysis variance . In addition , qualitative data obtain participant ' description experience read difficulty different stage study . These response analyse use NVivo software look theme .</detailed_description>
