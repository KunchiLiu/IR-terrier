	<brief_title>Clinical Study CMP-001 Combination With Pembrolizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary : • To determine recommended Phase 2 dose CMP-001 give combination Pembrolizumab subject advanced melanoma . Methodology : This multicenter , open-label , Phase 1b clinical study intratumoral administration CMP-001 combination Pembrolizumab subject advanced melanoma . The study conduct two phase : 1 ) Dose Escalation Phase 2 ) Dose Expansion Phase . The Dose Escalation Phase study utilize `` 3+3 '' design escalation . The study plan include evaluation 4 dose level CMP-001 administer intratumorally ( 1 mg , 3 mg , 5 mg 10 mg ) 2 dose schedule ( Schedule A [ weekly dose ] Schedule B [ Q3 week dose ] ) . A minimum 3 maximum 12 subject enrol dose escalation cohort . If Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) rate &lt; 33 % cohort , escalation next dose-escalation cohort may proceed . The Dose Expansion Phase include maximum two CMP-001 dose level two dose schedule ( i.e. , maximum 4 cohort ) ; maximum dose level high MTD Dose Escalation Phase . Dose expansion may occur dose level subject dose level dose escalation portion protocol complete DLT assessment period , dose level deem safe exceed acceptable DLT rate . Accrual dose expansion cohort may exceed 24 subject per cohort . The key objective Dose Expansion Phase characterize safety , pharmacodynamics , preliminary evidence antitumor activity CMP-001 administer combination Pembrolizumab select dose/schedule combination .</detailed_description>
