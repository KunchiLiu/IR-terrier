	<brief_title>Fat Protein Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design repeat measure study involve provision standard high protein/high fat even test meal 3 different evening within 7-day period study subject . The children/adolescents instruct give insulin dose carbohydrate meal ( calculate use optimal insulin carbohydrate ( ICR ) - 20 % ) . In addition additional dose fat protein content either ( together dose carbohydrate meal [ control meal ] ) , 1 hour , 2 hour meal . These carry random order subject . Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) carry whole 7 day period . Questionnaires assess acceptability young people parent extra insulin dos . After initial contact clinic , provision patient information leaflet , research nurse dietitian telephone patient family week answer question may study . If keen participate , appointment arrange consent commence study ( Visit 1 ) . At Visit 1 investigator obtain informed consent commence week-long run-in period participant optimise insulin carbohydrate ratio even meal . During week subject request test BG level 7 point throughout day ( pre-meals , 2 hr meal bed ) . They ask eat fat protein free meal one day . If necessary , adjustment insulin carbohydrate ratio ( ICR ) long-acting insulin dos make telephone experienced member clinical team . This decrease likelihood correction bolus high BG level require even meal study week . At end run-in week , participant attend outpatient clinic day care ward research facility Oxford Children 's Hospital Horton Hospital outpatient clinic Banbury Royal Berkshire Hospital Reading ( Visit 2 ) . At visit , subcutaneous glucose sensor insert research nurse child young people family train use prior study commence . CGM record BG level every 5 minute 7 day thus provide much information routine BG testing . It also alarm alert patient high low glucose level . Children young people also record BG level routine finger prick , pre-prandially bed wake morning . Also Visit 2 , study dietitian review BG reading food diary previous week optimise ICR dose rapid act insulin . This ratio use calculate insulin dos study meal . On three evening next 7 day , child eat standard high protein/high fat meal . The evening set , depend child family schedule . The child family able choose day study period complete study meal advise avoid day participant undertaken lot exercise , frequent hypoglycaemic episode unwell . The standard meal portion control gluten-free meal provide delivered Wiltshire Farm Foods consist meat-based main course dessert . These keep frozen use participant prepare accord manufacturer instruction . These meal come two size allow portion size adjust different age child , proportion fat , protein carbohydrate kept constant child , definition meal high protein high fat . Insulin dose standard meal give accord calculation carry dietitian administer one three way . The three evening random order follow : 1 . Insulin unit base ICR minus 20 % , fat/protein dose give together immediately meal [ control meal ] . 2 . Insulin unit base ICR minus 20 % , give immediately meal plus extra insulin fat/protein unit give 1 hour meal . 3 . Insulin unit base ICR minus 20 % give immediately meal plus extra insulin fat/protein unit give 2 hour meal . Full write instruction provide family aspect insulin dose study meal . During study standardise meal day child instruct eat food meal evening , correct later BG level unless dangerously high ( BG 16 mmol/l ketone 0.5 mmol/l ) . If BG level go low time ( BG le 4 mmol/l ) child instruct treat hypoglycaemia accord usual management . This data analyse separately . Children family ask complete diary trial week . At end study period ( day third meal ) , child come back research facility clinic end study visit ( visit 3 ) . A research nurse dietitian remove CGM sensor download data onto secure laptop . Children family ask complete short questionnaire acceptability use extra insulin dos , perception whether beneficial adverse effect . The study dietitian calculate standard outcomes patient 's sensor download pas anonymously study statistician analyse data .</detailed_description>
