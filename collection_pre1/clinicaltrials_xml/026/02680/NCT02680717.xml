	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Trial Treatment Pediatric Plaque Morphea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Morphea , also know localized scleroderma , rare autoimmune fibrosing disorder affect child adult . Morphea cause significant morbidity atrophy fibrosis skin underlie structure . Treatment halt progression disease reverse disease damage , leave child disfigure scar sometimes functional impairment . Consequently , extreme importance intervene early disease course effective therapy limit morbidity . Circumscribed morphea second common subtype child , comprise approximately 1/3 pediatric morphea case . It disfigure disease cause pain pruritus . There FDA-approved treatment consensus exist ideal therapy circumscribe morphea , either adult child . Most physician use topical medication circumscribe morphea yet little evidence support therapy . Topical immune modulators tacrolimus , imiquimod , calcipotriene investigate small study , though trial limit small sample size 9-19 patient lack control . Surveys demonstrate topical steroid commonly prescribed medication , even though evidence support use come case report . With insufficient evidence regard topical therapy , provider guidance make treatment decision , practice pattern vary widely even amongst pediatric dermatologist , child continue preventable scar . The investigator specific aim identify effective topical therapy circumscribe morphea . The investigator utilize comparative cohort study design evaluate comparative effectiveness three topical medication : clobetasol ointment , calcipotriene ointment , tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment . The investigator enroll subject CHW institution achieve study enrollment necessary power study .</detailed_description>
