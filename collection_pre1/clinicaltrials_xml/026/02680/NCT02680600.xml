	<detailed_description>Timely appropriate antibiotic therapy , sufficient guarantee adequate antibiotic concentration blood tissue , one important intervention critically ill patient infections.1,2 Cefepime fourth generation cephalosporin broad spectrum activity Gram-negative bacteria use empirical direct therapy severe infection like sepsis pneumonia . Nevertheless , administration adequate antibiotic dos real challenge critically ill patient pharmacokinetics ( PK ) drug may influence complex pathophysiological change occur sepsis.2 Recent review describe enormous pharmacokinetic variability beta-lactam antibiotic critically ill patients.3,4 Therefore , strategy dose individualization explore attempt good control patient 's exposure antibiotic , thereby potentially improve prognosis critically ill patient infection . On one hand , several small study already show well outcome critically ill patient expect high drug exposure , least less severely ill patients.5,6 This conclusion support DALI study , large multi-center prospective study.7 On hand , show insufficient antibiotic exposure may lead development antibiotic resistance.8 This link initially show inappropriately low quinolone exposure , recently class antibiotic include beta-lactams.9,10 In addition ensure plasma level high enough optimal antimicrobial activity suppress emergence resistance , individualize dosing might offer perspective prevent potential side-effects originate toxic plasma level . This seem particularly relevant cefepime , beta-lactam antibiotic , show cefepime underappreciated cause neurotoxicity , especially intensive care unit ( ICU ) patients,11,12 patient impaired renal function,13-16 patient brain disorders.17 Population pharmacokinetic model provide quantitative view effect particular individual factor plasma concentration time profile drug . Population PK model thereby help establish individual treatment regimen patient , depend specific patient covariates include model . As cefepime hydrophilic compound , drug elimination mainly determine renal clearance lesser extent non-renal clearance . Therefore , renal marker explore main determinant predict cefepime variability population PK models.18-24 However , none publish PK model develop use plasma urinary data , though access matrix may advantage identify clinically relevant covariates . Moreover , creatinine-based marker use covariates , , unclear whether new marker assess renal function ( e.g . cystatine C , uromodulin Kidney Injury Moleclure-1 ( KIM-1 ) ) accurate predict cefepime clearance . In study , clinical trial conduct develop population PK model cefepime critically ill patient assess renal non-renal clearance separately , base plasma urinary cefepime concentration . This model serve tool compare adequacy six different renal marker predictor renal cefepime clearance . After integrate adequate predictor PK model , final model use evaluate current dose recommendation cefepime .</detailed_description>
