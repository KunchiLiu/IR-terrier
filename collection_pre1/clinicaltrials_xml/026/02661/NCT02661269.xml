	<brief_summary>Can videomicroscopy sublingual microcirculation detect increase edema peripheral edema appear ? By measure decrease vesseldensity strong positive fluid balance within septic patient versus euvolemic post-cardiac surgery patient . Measuring reactance resistance ( BIVA method ) determine volume status . Primary outcome : - Total vessel density ( TVD ) Secondary outcome : - Fluid balance - BIVA measurement ( reactance &amp; resistance )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relation Between Increase Peripheral Edema Fluid Therapy Decrease Microcirculatory Vesseldensity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There lot method determine patient fluid-responsive , however moment stop fluid therapy lacking . So purpose study find 'stop ' moment fluid therapy peripheral edema present . With sublingual measurement vessel density Cytocam-IDF , compare septic patient fluid overload , euvolemic post-cardiac surgery patient arrival ICU healthy volunteer determine decrease vessel density fluid load . To give accurate view fluid overload include bio-impedance measurement reactance resistance . Fluid balance record accurate electronic patient record .</detailed_description>
