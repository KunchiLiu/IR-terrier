	<brief_summary>Persons burn-related pain remain treated access comprehensive burn pain management . We seek extend evidence-based cognitive behavioral pain management strategy group burn survivor currently treat burn pain specific goal reduce pain related interference life activity . Investigators conduct randomize controlled trial test central hypothesis computer-based cognitive-behavioral program ( Take Charge Burn Pain ) improve pain management , psychological health , improve participation burn survivor . Specific aim include : 1 ) determine efficacy web-based self-management intervention reduce pain pain-related interference increase pain management self-efficacy ; 2 ) determine whether Take Charge Burn Pain improve psychological health participation life activity person burn injury pain . Emerging research suggest web-based pain management intervention may feasible effective alternative clinic-based intervention patient mobility geographic restriction , treat tertiary burn center .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Burns among painful injury require painful daily wound care rehabilitation procedure . Despite best effort burn care professional , burn frequently result acute chronic suffer poor functional outcome otherwise healthy individual many year productive life remain . The evidence base direct burn pain management generally weak , much work base clinical preference rather scientific evidence . There tremendous need clinical trial evaluate improve standard care . While pharmacological treatment option widely available burn survivor throughout emergent , acute , rehabilitation phase heal limited access comprehensive pain management . It critical establish accessible pain management approach address emotional , cognitive physical dimension burn pain experience . Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) proven effective patient chronic pain study demonstrate efficacy provide tele-rehabilitation CBT service improve outcomes person disability . However , tele-rehabilitation CBT pain management traditionally offer studied person burn-related pain . The population burn survivor limit access comprehensive pain management include CBT due lack access , financial constraint , mobility issue render clinic-based CBT impractical . Innovative rehabilitation intervention delivery method need improve pain , functional , psychological participation outcome burn survivor significant , yet untreated , pain problem . Investigators propose conduct two group randomize control trial test central hypothesis web-based CBT improve pain severity , pain interference , self-efficacy , psychological health participation life activity burn survivor pain . Emerging research suggest tele-rehabilitation may feasible , effective alternative ( much broad applicability ) clinic-based intervention patient access restriction . This project address 2 specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To determine efficacy web-based , CBT self-management intervention ( Take Charge Burn Recovery - Pain [ TCBR-Pain ) improve pain management self-efficacy , reduce pain pain-related interference burn survivor pain . Outcomes measure use battery standardized test baseline , 2 month ( treatment completion ) 5 month post-treatment follow-up . Self-reported pain self-efficacy , pain severity pain interference measure use validated instrument ( Pain Self-efficacy Scale , Brief Pain Inventory respectively ) . Hypothesis 1 : TCBR- Pain participant demonstrate significantly great improvement pain self-efficacy , pain severity pain interference relative attention-control group 2 month ( treatment completion ) 5 month follow . Specific Aim 2 : To determine efficacy web-based , CBT self-management intervention ( ( Take Charge Burn Recovery - Pain [ TCBR - Pain ] ) improve psychological health participation life activity burn survivor pain . Outcomes measure use battery standardized test baseline , 2 month ( treatment completion ) 5 month follow-up . Self-reported depression anxiety , participation life activity measure use validated instrument ( PHQ-9 Depression Scale PCL -Civilian Anxiety Scale , World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scales [ WHODAS-II ] ) respectively . Hypothesis 2 : TCBR- Pain participant demonstrate significantly great improvement depressive anxiety symptom participation relative attention-control group 2 month ( treatment completion ) 5 month follow . This initial randomized trial provide critical data recruitment retention well effect size sample size next stage research - multi-center , clinical trial determine scalability intervention . In proposed study , consent 256 burn survivor pain randomly assign intervention control group . After informed oral consent obtain , potential participant screen eligibility . If eligible , ( see inclusion/exclusion criterion ) participant consent complete baseline assessment on-line . Once web-based assessment complete , participant randomly assign either web-based 7 lesson TCBR - Pain program 7 lesson Attention Control -Education group . Randomization occur balance block stratify group composition pain level , self-reported Total Burn Surface Area , time since initial burn injury . Participants complete post-intervention assessment 2 month 5 month assess pain severity , pain interference , psychological health , participation life activity . Participants obtain treatment enrol study include intervention document controlled analysis necessary . Findings study support future research dissemination effort improve pain management , psychological health life participation patient follow burn injury innovative rehabilitation intervention delivery method .</detailed_description>
