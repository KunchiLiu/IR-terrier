	<brief_title>A Trial CDX-1401 Combination With Poly-ICLC Pembrolizumab , Previously Treated Advanced Solid Tumor Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antigen presentation cellular immunity complex process , subject modulation tumor microenvironment . Antigen present cell tumor microenvironment acquire antigen tumor cell . Tumors express several tumor specific antigen leverage immune system mount effective anti-tumor response . NY-ESO-1 , one cancer testis antigen , express several tumor include non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) , melanoma . NY-ESO-1 highly immunogenic spontaneous tumor regression association humoral cellular response NY-ESO-1 report . NY-ESO-1 tumor specific detect non-malignant tissue exception germ cell trophoblast , thus make attractive target cancer vaccine development . Cancer vaccines augment process cancer specific antigen presentation , however efficacy protein-based vaccine limit due weak immunogenicity inefficient uptake antigen present cell presentation T B cell , lack target appropriate antigen present cell . Dendritic cell ( DCs ) highly specialized antigen-presenting cell play central role initiate regulate immunity . Deca-lectin , DEC-205 ( CD205 ) surface receptor DCs , highly express human DCs mediate antigen uptake , processing , presentation . CDX-1401 fully human anti-DEC-205 mAb ( 3G9 ) genetically fuse full length NY-ESO-1 . In preclinical study , Dec-205 fuse NY-ESO-was efficiently cross-presented T-cells NY-ESO-1 protein alone . In recently conclude phase 1 study CDX-1401 combination adjuvant Toll-like receptor agonist Resiquimod ( TLR7/8 agonist ) Hiltonol ( poly-ICLC ; TLR3 agonist ) , CDX-1401 well tolerate dose-limiting toxicity treatment relate grade 3/4 toxicity . Clinical activity note solid tumor include NSCLC . Interestingly , patient progress CDX-1401 subsequently receive immune checkpoint inhibitor several patient NY-ESO-1-specific cellular response partial response RECISTimmune-related response criterion ( IRRC ) . Previous study report enhanced T-cell response autologous dendritic cell/myeloma fusion vaccine PD-1 blockade use CT-011 ( Anti-PD1 antibody ) . In addition , increase tumor-infiltrating dendritic cell PD1 positive mediate immune suppression PD-1 blockade mouse ovarian cancer model enhance effector T-cell response reduce tumor burden . Thus , hypothesize ability CDX-1401 generate effective anti-tumor immune response could enhance co-administered anti-PD1 antibody . In study , investigator examine safety three drug combination CDX-1401 , Poly-ICL ( TLR-3 agonist ) , Pembrolizumab , impact generate robust effective anti-tumor immune response . The preliminary clinical data Pembrolizumab promising , strategy enhance tumor specific antigen presentation may augment response clinical benefit Pembrolizumab . Primary Objective : To assess safety , tolerability CDX-1401 combination Pembrolizumab Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine whether anti-tumor response substantially increase vaccination CDX-1401 ( anti-DEC205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein vaccine ) combination immune-checkpoint inhibitor , Pembrolizumab ( anti-PD1 mAb ) previously treat patient advance solid tumor . 2 . To determine immune response NY-ESO-1 tumor specific antigens patient treat CDX-1401 Pembrolizumab . 3 . To evaluate change Tumor infiltrate lymphocyte immune evasive pathway biomarkers post treatment CDX-1401 Pembrolizumab . 4 . To perform exploratory analysis identify biomarkers predict antigen specific T-cell response clinical benefit CDX-1401 Pembrolizumab .</detailed_description>
