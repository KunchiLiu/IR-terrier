	<brief_title>Effect Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure The Pharyngeal Swallow Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm infant underdeveloped lung term infant cardio-respiratory illness frequently need place ventilatory assistance . Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( NCPAP ) proven effective mode noninvasive ventilation neonate , delivers positive pressure airway throughout respiratory cycle . NCPAP work improve breathe pattern neonate ; increase mean airway pressure , stent upper airway , decrease proximal airway resistance , reduce physiological dead space , optimize lung recruitment improve diaphragmatic function . While many infant Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICUs ) require NCPAP , many medical developmental need initiate oral feeding need address . Oral feeding neonate NCPAP common practice many NICUs , however effect practice neonatal swallow mechanism never investigate . Swallowing complex sensorimotor function allow infant safely effectively ingest liquid nutrition . The ability infant successfully feed dependent precise interconnection anatomy , physiology neurology pathway . Afferent sequence play integral role infant swallow mechanism sensory feedback require phase swallow allow appropriate positioning anatomic structure , well modulate strength , velocity , time muscle contraction . Sensory information receive various type sensory receptor distribute throughout oral cavity , pharynx , larynx esophagus . Localized area infant 's anatomy know particular type sensory receptor excite specific stimulus elicit appropriate motor movement . One densely populated sensory receptor mechanoreceptors sensitive touch pressure help decipher shape , texture , size temperature bolus swallow . The mechanoreceptors also sensitive pressure movement air flow breathing . The sensation perceive receptor responsible send afferent sensory information medullary region brainstem process central pattern generator ( CPGs ) . CPGs compose dedicate network interneurons responsible sequence activate different motor neuron specify intensity generate motor pattern . Both swallow CPG respiratory CPG house within medulla . The close proximity neuron allow precise swallow breathing coordination . A close interrelationship swallow respiratory process evident encompass share anatomic structure muscular component within pharynx , act physiologically biomechanically reciprocal event . This close interrelationship swallow breathe lead controversy difference opinion among neonatologists decision start oral feeding NCPAP . Although research directly related effect NCPAP swallow process neonate , NCPAP report induce dilatation laryngeal open preterm infant inhibit swallow reflex adult . For preterm infant , neonatologists advocate initiation oral feed 34 week gestational age , even require NCPAP ; others strictly wait NCPAP discontinue oral feeding establish , fear infant may difficulty coordinate breathe swallow act , result airway compromise . For term infant , many propose oral feeding establish physiologic stability demonstrate , either without NCPAP . Such controversy exist due lack evidence effect ( ) NCPAP swallow safety human neonate . To knowledge study complete human infant evaluate effect NCPAP pharyngeal swallow mechanism . Previous study utilize neonatal lamb , reveal application NCPAP deleterious effect cardiopulmonary safety , feed efficiency nutritive swallowing- breathing coordination . This study design aim effectively assess effect NCPAP pharyngeal swallow mechanism human neonate . The investigator hypothesize presence NCPAP lead alteration sensorimotor sequence pharyngeal swallow mechanism , increase risk airway compromise aspiration . The mechanoreceptors , perceive sensory input liquid bolus , may alter reception continuous stream airflow , provide NCPAP .</detailed_description>
