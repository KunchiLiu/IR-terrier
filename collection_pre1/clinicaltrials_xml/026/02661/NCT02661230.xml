	<brief_summary>This project propose development design motor intervention use cognitive video game describe feasibility , safety acceptability virtual augment video game device name Virtual Reality Intensive Care Unit ( VRICU ) . The project two phase perform healthy participant ( Phase 1 ) heart patient elective heart surgery Intensive Care Unit ( Phase 2 ) . Furthermore , brain function measure exer-gaming VRICU device non-invasive instrument ( fNIRS/EEG ) healthy participant heart patient . The VRICU device patient friendly construction allow patient exergaming bed . The project cooperation scientist USZ ( physiotherapist / anaesthsiologists / engineer ) , human movement scientist ETHZ ( poly- / electro- ) mechanic Paul Scherrer Institut .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There converge evidence system level physical exercise participation beneficial cognition , especially different subtypes attention . Such evidence highlight importance promote physical exercise prevent reverse cognitive neural decline . Accordingly , physical exercise serve promote function patient . Physical exercise game may engage gauge performance increase motor learn early rehabilitation program perform intensive care unit . This project propose development design cognitive motor intervention use custom video game ( perform supine position bed ) enhance brain activity describe feasibility , safety acceptability virtual augment video dance gaming . This project divide two ( 2 ) phase : Phase1 The patient expect exercise video game usual standing position due condition . Thus , design patient friendly construction colleague construction department Paul Scherrer Institute ( Villigen , Switzerland ) , enable video game exercise supine position . This construction custom video game test first healthy participant feasibility , acceptability safety . Furthermore , brain activity participant measure evaluate , shortly play video game 15 healthy participant . Phase 2 After device procedure test phase 1 feasible , acceptable safe , maximal 10 patient ICU ward ( receive elective heart surgery , recruit evaluate feasibility , safety , acceptability effect brain function custom video exercise game . The aim study : Phase 1 Objective To determine feasibility , safety acceptability effect brain function cognitive motor intervention use custom video game healthy participant . Phase 2 Objectives To determine feasibility , safety acceptability ( possible ) cognitive motor intervention use custom video game Intensive Care Unit . Evaluation brain function , exercise use video game .</detailed_description>
