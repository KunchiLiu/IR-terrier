	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 Bivalent Virus-Like Particle Vaccine Elderly Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vaccine test study call norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent virus-like particle ( VLP ) vaccine adjuvanted aluminum hydroxide ( Formulation A ) adjuvanted monophosphoryl lipid A ( MPL ) aluminum hydroxide ( Formulation B ) . Two norovirus vaccine formulation test select development formulation generate optimal specific antibody response may provide protection norovirus issafe population age 60 year . This study look side effect level antibody norovirus form people injected different formulation norovirus vaccine candidate . The study enroll approximately 325 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance ) one five treatment group . - Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine ( Formulation A ) 1-dose , participant ≥ 60 year - Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine ( Formulation A ) 2-dose , participant ≥ 60 year - Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine ( Formulation B ) 1-dose , participant ≥ 60 year - Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine ( Formulation B ) 2-dose , participant ≥ 60 year - Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine ( Formulation A ) 1-dose , participant 18 49 year All participant age 60 year old administer either NoV vaccine ( Formulation A B ) placebo Day 1 NoV vaccine ( Formulation A B ) Day 29 study . In order keep treatment arm undisclosed patient doctor , randomize one dose group receive dose placebo ( saline solution active ingredient ) Day 1 follow NoV vaccine Day 29 . Those randomized 2 dos receive NoV vaccine Day 1 Day 29 . In case urgent medical need participant unblinded . Adults age 18 49 receive placebo Day 1 follow NoV vaccine Formulation A Day 29 . Participants ask record reactions/ symptom may relate vaccine diary card 28 day vaccination . This multi-center trial conduct United States America . The overall time participate study 393 day . Participants make multiple visit clinic include final follow-up visit Day 393 .</detailed_description>
