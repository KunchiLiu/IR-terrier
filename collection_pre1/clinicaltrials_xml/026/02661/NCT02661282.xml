	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study phase base join study . If enrolled Phase I Dose Escalation part ( Group 1 ) , 4 dose level CMV CTLs study Phase I part . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first 3-6 participant receive low dose level . Each 3-6 new participant receive high dose study drug participant , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose CMV CTLs find . If enrol Phase II Dose Expansion part , receive CMV CTLs high dose tolerate Phase 1 . You assign 1 2 study group ( Groups 2 3 ) base status disease treatment receive previously . - If disease come back treatment surgery part routine care , Group 2 . - If complete chemotherapy radiation therapy tumor growth , Group 3 . Study Drug/Cell Administration : There 42 day cycle Cycles 1-4 . If Group 1 2 , Cycles 5 beyond also 42 day . If Group 3 , Cycles 5 beyond 28 day . On Day 0 , day enroll study , leukapheresis perform 2-3 hour collect white blood cell , include type call T cell . Leukapheresis use machine remove white cell blood . These white blood cell use make CMV CTLs treatment later , start Day 22 Cycle 1 . For leukapheresis procedure , lie bed lean back chair , tube vein arm . One tube remove blood pass machine remove white blood cell , include T cell . The rest blood go back body tube arm . After leukapheresis , start receive temozolomide CMV CTLs . You take temozolomide capsule mouth 1 time day Days 1-21 Cycles 1-4 . If Group 1 2 , continue take temozolomide Days 1-21 Cycles 5 beyond . If Group 3 , take temozolomide Days 1-5 Cycles 5 beyond . You take temozolomide bedtime time day . Temozolomide take empty stomach ( least 2 hour eat ) 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You swallow temozolomide capsule whole , one right , without chew . If vomit study drug , make dose . You take next schedule dose usual time . The capsule temozolomide open . If capsule damage broken , avoid let capsule content contact skin mucous membrane . Spills powder temozolomide capsule clean carefully . If come contact powder , wash hand well . If spill surface , area must wash least 3 time rub alcohol , follow water . You receive CMV CTLs vein 1-5 minute Day 22 Cycles 1-4 . After infusion , need stay clinic 1 hour study staff check . Before receive CMV CTLs , give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . If Group 2 , Day 30 Cycle 1 , surgery remove tumor part routine care . You sign separate consent form describe procedure risk . Leftover tumor tissue surgery collect used biomarker test . After recover surgery ( may take 14 day ) , start receive temozolomide Day 1 Cycle 2 . Study Visits All Groups : On Day 1 every cycle : - You physical exam , include neurological exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This blood draw also include pregnancy test become pregnant ( start Cycle 2 ) . - If become pregnant , urine collect pregnancy test . ( Cycle 1 ) . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 Cycle 1 , Days 22 29 Cycles 2-4 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . If disease get bad study treatment surgery part standard care , leftover tumor tissue surgery collect biomarker test . Study Visits Group 1 : On Days 15 29 Cycles 5 beyond , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Every 6 week , MRI brain . On Days 22 30 Cycles 1-4 , Day 1 Cycles 2-5 Day 34 Cycle 8 , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . Study Visits Group 2 : On Days 15 29 Cycles 5 beyond , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Every 6 week start Cycle 3 , MRI brain . Within 48 hour surgery , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . Within 24 hour surgery , MRI brain . On Day 30 Cycle 1 , surgery remove tumor part routine care . Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . Within 2 day surgery , MRI brain . After recovered surgery , start back study visit . Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker test follow schedule : - Day 1 Cycles 2-5 - Day 38 Cycle 1 - Day 16 Cycle 2 - Days 22 30 Cycles 2-4 - Day 34 Cycle 8 Study Visits Group 3 : Every 6 week Cycles 2-4 , every 8 week , MRI brain . On Days 22 30 Cycles 1-4 , Day 1 Cycles 2-5 Day 20 Cycle 10 , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . At time study , doctor think need , may 1 test repeat safety . Length Treatment : You receive CMV CTLs 4 cycle temozolomide 12 cycle . You longer able take study drug/cells disease get bad , intolerable side effect , unable follow study direction . You need stop receive CMV CTLs early enough CTLs available . Follow-Up : The study staff call ask feel follow schedule : - 30 day last study drug/cell dose - every 8 week , stop study drug/cells intolerable side effect ( disease get bad start new cancer treatment , schedule change every 3 month ) - every 3 month , stop study drug/cells disease get bad These call take 5-10 minute time . This investigational study . CMV CTLs FDA approve commercially available . They currently use research purpose . Temozolomide FDA approve commercially available treatment brain tumor , include glioblastoma . The use combination treat glioblastoma investigational . The study doctor explain study drug/cells design work . Up 54 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
