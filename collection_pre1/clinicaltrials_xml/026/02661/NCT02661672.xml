	<brief_title>INVEST-REGISTRY : Minimally Invasive Endoscopic Surgical Treatment With Apollo Patients With Brain Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This study prospective , non-randomized , multi-center , international , single arm registry enroll 200 patient 30 US center 5 center outside United States . Patient Population : Adult patient supratentorial brain hemorrhage ( ICH and/or IVH ) meet INCLUSION criterion meet one EXCLUSION criterion INVEST trial , ultimately undergo MIES Apollo active INVEST center . Indication : The Apollo system clear controlled aspiration soft tissue and/or fluid endoscopically guide neurosurgery ventricular system . In present study , investigator propose investigate safety efficacy system minimally invasive evacuation brain hemorrhage - IVH , IVH ICH ICH alone - patient qualify INVEST trial .</detailed_description>
