	<brief_summary>The main purpose interdisciplinary proposal conduct two randomize control trial ( RCT ) efficacy self-administered systematic light exposure ( Bright White Light ( BWL ) ) , innovative , low cost , low burden intervention treat cancer-related fatigue . Another common often overlap treatment side-effect cognitive impairment . A secondary outcome propose RCT , thus , cognitive functioning . Finally , possible underlying chronobiological ( circadian activity rhythm , sleep ) , biological ( pro inflammatory marker ) , neurophysiological ( brain morphology ) mechanism BWL explore .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Cancer Side-effects With Systematic Light Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two independent similar RCTs total 144 breast cancer patient ( Group 1 = 72 high risk patient ; Group 2 = 72 low risk breast cancer patient ) post-treatment screen fatigue randomize BWL ( 36 two group ) dim light ( DL ) ( 36 two group ) exposure 30 minutes/morning 4 week , assess , , immediately 3 month intervention . Measures include questionnaire , cognitive assessment , actigraphy , blood sample , saliva sample , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . 1.1 Aims hypothesis . Aim 1 : To test efficacy BWL fatigue ( primary outcome ) breast cancer patient . Hypothesis 1 : Compared control participant expose DL , participant randomize BWL report less fatigue immediately 3 month intervention . Aim 2 : To test efficacy BWL cognitive functioning ( secondary outcome ) . Hypothesis 2 : Compared control , BWL recipients show improved cognitive function immediately 3 month intervention . Aim 3 : To explore effect BWL chronobiological , biological , neurophysiological marker . Hypothesis 3 : BWL associate normalized circadian activity rhythm ( 3a ) ; improve sleep ( 3b ) ; decrease inflammation ( 3c ) ; increase cortical subcortical grey matter density ( 3d ) ; increase cortical subcortical white matter integrity ( 3e ) . If hypothesis 1 and/or 2 confirm , mediate effect marker explore .</detailed_description>
