	<brief_summary>This study determine prevalence rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) Lusaka , Zambia school-based screening methodology use ultraportable echocardiography recently validate , abridge screen protocol base World Heart Federation criterion . Children screen positive RHD school undergo confirmatory evaluation University Teaching Hospital ( UTH ) , Lusaka 's main referral hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It estimate RHD affect 32 million people worldwide , vast majority case occur develop world . RHD common cardiovascular disease child young adult major cause death child age 5 many part develop world , particularly sub-Saharan Africa . RHD result repeat attack acute rheumatic fever ( ARF ) . ARF systemic inflammatory disease occur mainly child , characterize fever , painful joint , heart , skin , neurological manifestation . ARF link precede Group A streptococcal ( GAS ) throat infection , , leave untreated , carry estimate 2-3 % risk develop ARF . The pathologic hallmark RHD classically valvulitis affect mostly mitral and/or aortic valve . Inflammation myocardium pericardium may exacerbate effect valvular insufficiency , result congestive heart failure , stroke complication . Over time , severe disability death ensue , especially develop country management RHD patient challenge surgical intervention readily available . ARF RHD diseases poverty , especially country limit healthcare system . GAS thrive situation over-crowding poor nutrition sanitation common medical treatment sore throat readily available . For reason , RHD endemic many part develop world , particularly sub-Saharan Africa , almost disappear part develop world ( except indigenous population country ) . It note initial decline ARF/RHD US Europe likely due improve living condition hygiene ( primordial prevention ) , since predate introduction penicillin . RHD one truly preventable chronic disease . Currently , many sub-Saharan African country focus effort primary secondary prevention due lack resource . The long-term goal ongoing effort Zambia develop capability provide effective primary secondary prevention RHD , ultimate goal eliminate new case . Although RHD associate major morbidity mortality child young adult , recently reliable estimate burden disease exist sub-Saharan Africa . Population-based screening RHD limit clinical examination , detect early RHD heart murmur clinical sign disease absent ( subclinical disease ) . Estimates RHD prevalence base clinical surveillance method compare screen echocardiography show result gross underestimate ( 10 fold ) . With advance portable ultrasonography development international guideline echocardiographic diagnosis RHD , population-based screen subclinical RHD possible . Using new approach , recent study country similar geographic demographic profile Zambia show RHD prevalence sub-Saharan Africa much high previously think ; approximately 1-3 % schoolgoing child appear evidence definite borderline RHD . In study , investigator apply echocardiographic screening method determine prevalence RHD large population Zambian school child . Data disease burden RHD Zambia use inform design conduct health program combat RHD . The propose study involve sample size least 1,024 student grades 7-12 fifteen randomly select school Lusaka . Each student meet inclusion criterion undergo focused history physical examination rapid echocardiographic screening . The fifteen school involve study identify random sample 119 currently operate primary secondary school Lusaka use standard sample method . Approximately 60-80 student school screen . The screening conduct use ultraportable ultrasound device abridge screen protocol validate separate study investigator University Cape Town South Africa . Children suspect ARF RHD follow UTH in-depth clinical examination quantitative electrocardiogram . Children definite borderline RHD accord World Heart Federation Criteria offer secondary penicillin prophylaxis accord national guideline Zambia . Children sore throat refer evaluation treatment penicillin accord national guideline primary prevention RHD UTH local health clinic . An additional feature study development local technical expertise conduct echocardiographic screening . This necessary health worker Lusaka proficient cardiac echocardiography . The feasibility task-shifting echocardiographic screen non-expert health worker demonstrate similar setting . The investigator therefore train radiography technician little previous experience echocardiography conduct school-based screening . Given radiographer newly train conduct screen echocardiography , two mechanism implement help ensure successful school screening : ( 1 ) international echocardiography technician expert periodically accompany study staff school screening support work local radiographer ; ( 2 ) screen echocardiograms de-identified review remotely professional third-party echocardiographer report back echocardiograms determine read falsely negative field team . Most data obtain study enter mobile electronic device ( computer tablet ) time capture digital system ( `` eRegister '' ) develop specifically study . The system use DiMagi 's `` CommCare '' platform , include customizable mobile health data collection application online portal , `` CommCareHQ , '' secure data view reporting . All access CommCare platform include mobile submission do HTTPS ( hypertext transfer protocol ) cryptographically secure . Mobile device password-locked accessible study staff member device allocate . Once data submit server automatically erase mobile device . Echocardiograms also save system ; image videos temporarily store hard drive ultrasound device transfer eRegister .</detailed_description>
