	<brief_summary>The number patient require major ablative surgery oral cavity , include partial/radical mandibular maxillary resection , due head neck carcinoma , osteoradionecrosis ( ORN ) , medication-related osteonecrosis jaw ( MRONJ ) accurately report . Surgical reconstruction restore oral function aesthetic form challenge maxillofacial surgeon , greatly impact patient ' quality life ( QOL ) . Recently , active collaboration surgeon Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Unit prosthodontist ( LB ) Department Dentistry General Hospital Saint-John Bruges lead development `` Oncology-bridge ( O-bridge ) '' protocol , offer ( immediate/delayed ) fix prosthetic rehabilitation minimum session strongly reduce two-week treatment time , consequently accelerate patient ' improve QOL considerably reduce cost . The investigator aim develop prospective database patient demographic , surgical , dental , prosthetic QOL parameter collect consecutive visit within framework routine practice , register oncological patient eligible ( immediate/delayed ) fix prosthodontic rehabilitation time oral cavity reconstruction This could provide investigator information potential patient , surgical prosthetic factor influence short- long-term biological mechanical stability , well patient QOL . Moreover , registration result could function measurement quality care , could use sample size calculation future large prospective trial .</brief_summary>
