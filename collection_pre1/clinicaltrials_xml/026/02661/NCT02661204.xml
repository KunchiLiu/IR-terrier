	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate diagnostic performance new ABUS system among 4 different population : Population A : woman undergo screen familial genetic predisposition breast cancer . Population B : woman newly diagnose breast cancer . ABUS performance compare breast MRI pre-operative assessment breast cancer extent . Population C : woman BI-RADS 3 4 lesion routine breast image examination . ABUS evaluate problem-solving tool . Population D : woman undergo breast MRI assessment breast implant integrity . ABUS performance compare breast MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Performance Automated Breast Ultrasound System ( ABUS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Population A : woman age range 20 40 year , strong family history breast cancer predispose gene mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 . A total 100 patient enrol . Population B : woman new breast cancer diagnosis undergo pre-operative local cancer staging.A total 50 patient enrol . Population C : woman lesion classify BI-RADS 3 4 routine breast image examination . A total 50 patient enrol . Population D : woman undergo breast-MRI evaluation breast implant integrity . A total 50 patient enrol . The expected duration subject participation 5 year population A : every year patient undergo ABUS examination result compare HHUS examination . In population B , C D one examination perform data obtain ABUS compare HH-US breast MRI data . Images evaluate radiologist breast image experience ABUS finding compare finding HHUS MR image . Afterwards , two three reader ( radiologist different level experience breast image ) blind clinical , HH-US MRI data , evaluate interobserver agreement ABUS image evaluate Methods minimise bias Population A - During recruitment , family history breast cancer in-depth analyse order avoid bias relate different level risk breast cancer . In order reduce loss patient follow-up , woman invite every year undergo HHUS ABUS examination department .</detailed_description>
