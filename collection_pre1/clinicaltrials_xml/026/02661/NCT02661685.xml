	<brief_title>Safety Study Adoptive Transfer Autologous IKDC-like Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer immunosurveillance mouse human protect host outgrowth tumor cell . This may establish sufficient rationale cancer immunotherapy aim control eradicate tumor induction effective anti-tumor immunity . The interest develop cancer immunotherapy intensify recent trial result show durable response approximately 20 % patient receive various kind immunotherapy include adoptive transfer tumor-specific T cell , cancer vaccine , T cell response checkpoint blockade inhibition . Discoveries date , natural killer ( NK ) cell function positively associate reduction cancer risk well survival gastrointestinal stromal tumor patient . Interferon-producing killer dendritic cell ( IKDCs ) subpopulation NK cell discover mouse spleen , lyse tumor cell acquire antigen presentation cell ( APC ) activity . We find putative IKDCs human peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) ; meanwhile , also develop method expand IKDC-like cell murine bone marrow human PBMC ex vivo . The expanded human IKDC-like cell cytotoxic toward several human leukemia cell line capable activate allogeneic T cell . For vivo anti-tumor activity , find two transfer syngeneic murine IKDC-like cell reduce tumor burden B16/OVA B16/F10 melanoma Lewis lung carcinoma model , enhance interferon ( IFN ) -γ production splenocytes tumor-bearing mouse . Moreover , six transfer IKDC-like cell significantly prolong survival mouse bear B16/F10 melanoma . Based preclinical result , hypothesize anti-tumor activity human IKDC-like cell . We thus propose phase 1 clinical trial ass safety autologous IKDC-like cell therapy metastatic cancer patient determination maximum tolerate dose , monitor immune parameter patient IKDC-like cell transfer investigate therapeutic mechanism biomarkers .</detailed_description>
