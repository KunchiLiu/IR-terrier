	<brief_summary>Since development last year bipolar energy surgery hysteroscopy , hysteroscopic treatment submucosal uterine myoma perform use either monopolar bipolar current . It seem use bipolar energy decrease rate adhesion prospective data adhesion rate fertility use bipolar energy surgery poor , currently recommendation choice technique use . The main purpose study compare rate uterine adhesion six week surgical hysteroscopic treatment uterine submucosal myoma , use monopolar bipolar energy . The pregnancy spontaneous miscarriage rate also evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Intra Uterine Synechiae Occurence Using Bipolar Energy Compared With Monopolar Energy Myoma Resection Women Having Menorraghia and/or Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine fibroid detect many case excessive bleed consultation primary secondary infertility . When submucosal type , require surgical treatment hysteroscopy . The hysteroscopic resection submucosal fibroid describe Neuwirth Amin 1976 allow reduce morbidity , length hospital stay cost therapeutic treatment , satisfactory rate functional success . The surgical hysteroscopic treatment symptomatic submucosal myoma perform initially monopolar endoscopic resection . This required resection use glycine distension medium , essential conduction monopolar current . Complications proper monopolar resection describe well know . The first specific complication TURP syndrome , link reabsorption glycine byproducts distensium medium . It cause hyponatremia lead cerebral edema . This complication prevent limiting duration intervention 45 minute constantly monitor input-output balance . The second specific complication relate diffusion heat damage surround healthy tissue increase risk uterine adhesion . These adhesion source menstrual disorder like hypomenorrhea amenorrhea , infertility recurrent miscarriage . For 20 year , several approach propose reduce occurrence postoperative adhesion . However , result either convincing , either need confirmation . Since several year , use bipolar energy hysteroscopic resection developped.The advantage technique avoid glycine distension medium use saline instead , hereby significantly reduce risk hyponatremia . It especially give small heat diffusion , hereby limit damage healthy tissue nearby . Although hysteroscopic bipolar resection submucosal fibroid routine technique , date study literature compare use monopolar bipolar energy hysteroscopic myomectomy . The main objective study compare rate adhesion resection uterine myoma , use bipolar versus monopolar current . The secondary objective evaluate impact subsequent fertility number pregnancy miscarriage .</detailed_description>
