	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Study Paclitaxel And Ricolinostat For The Treatment Of Gynecological Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Ricolinostat treatment disease . The FDA approve Paclitaxel treatment option Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Peritoneal Cancer . The FDA approve Bevacizumab combination chemotherapy treatment option Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Peritoneal Cancer . In study , hop learn high dose Ricolinostat give safely together Paclitaxel weekly basis Paclitaxel weekly basis Bevacizumab every week . Ricolinostat drug stop cancer grow block action protein call HDAC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must recurrent persistent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal carcinoma , recurrent endometrial cancer , recurrent cervical cancer . Histologic documentation original primary tumor require via pathology report . Participants must measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . Participants must least one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen management primary disease ( e.g. , regimen contain carboplatin , cisplatin , another organoplatinum compound ) . This initial treatment may include intraperitoneal therapy , consolidation , biologic/targeted ( noncytotoxic ) agent ( e.g. , bevacizumab ) extend therapy administer surgical nonsurgical assessment . Participants allow receive , required receive , biologic/targeted ( noncytotoxic ) therapy part primary treatment regimen . Participants must recurrence within 12 month last platinumcontaining regimen . Age 18 year old ECOG performance status 0 1 Life expectancy great 16 week Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Previous toxicity previous treatment must resolve grade 1 less For patient expansion cohort B , stable Grade 2 neuropathy allow . The effect paclitaxel oral ricolinostat develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Participants must able willing swallow pill absorb oral medication . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Participants must able willing follow protocol instruction schedule . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . In addition , small molecule kinase inhibitor type investigational agent may administer within 4 week first dose study treatment . Participants may receive investigational agent treatment cancer . No hormonal therapy allow within 1 week initiate study treatment . Participants may radiation &gt; 25 % bone marrow . Prior treatment histone deacetylase inhibitor . Prior treatment weekly paclitaxel recurrent persistent disease allow . Participants may receive weekly paclitaxel part treatment newly diagnose cancer , may receive maintenance therapy follow initial therapy platinum taxane therapy . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History severe allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition either paclitaxel Ricolinostat . Patients require administration paclitaxel desensitization procedure eligible study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients chronic viral illness HIVpositivity active hepatitis B C ineligible increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Any sign , symptom , and/or radiographic evidence complete partial bowel obstruction Patients history invasive malignancy , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer specific malignancy note , exclude evidence malignancy present within last three year . Patients also exclude previous cancer treatment contraindicate protocol therapy . Carcinoma situ breast cervix Primary endometrial cancer meeting follow condition : Stage great IA , grade 1 2 , superficial myometrial invasion , without vascular lymphatic invasion ; poorly differentiate subtypes , include papillary serous , clear cell , FIGO grade 3 lesion . Patients receive prior chemotherapy abdominal pelvic tumor OTHER THAN treatment ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer within last three year exclude . Patients may receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy localize breast cancer , provide complete three year prior registration , patient remain free recurrent metastatic disease . Patients clinically significant cardiovascular disease . This include : Uncontrolled hypertension , define systolic great 140 mm Hg diastolic great 90 mm Hg despite antihypertensive medication . Myocardial infarction unstable angina within 6 month prior registration . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II great congestive heart failure . ( see Appendix III ) History serious ventricular arrhythmia ( i.e. , ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation ) serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication . This include asymptomatic atrial fibrillation control ventricular rate . Any history congenital long QT syndrome The subject correct QT interval calculate Fridericia formula ( QTcF ) &gt; 500 m within 28 day randomization . Note : initial QTcF find &gt; 500 m , two additional EKGs separate least 3 minute perform . If average three consecutive result QTcF ≤500 m , subject meet eligibility regard . Patients serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture within 28 day registration Patients history organ transplant . Patients active bleed pathologic condition carry high risk bleeding , know bleed disorder , coagulopathy , tumor involve ( contact , invade encase ) major vessel . Gastrointestinal disorder , particularly potential risk perforation fistula formation include : Any follow within 28 day registration Intraabdominal tumor/metastases invade GI mucosa Active peptic ulcer disease Inflammatory bowel disease ( include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease ) , diverticulitis , cholecystitis , symptomatic cholangitis appendicitis Malabsorption syndrome . Any follow within 6 month registration Abdominal fistula Gastrointestinal perforation Bowel obstruction gastric outlet obstruction Note : Patients require drainage gastrostomy ( e.g. , PEG tube ) and/or parenteral hydration and/or nutrition eligible . Intraabdominal abscess . Note : Complete resolution intraabdominal abscess must confirm prior registration even abscess occur 6 month prior registration . Patients history evidence upon physical examination CNS disease , include primary brain tumor , seizures control nonenzyme inducing anticonvulsant , brain metastasis and/or epidural disease , history cerebrovascular accident ( CVA , stroke ) , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) subarachnoid hemorrhage within six month prior first date study treatment . Major surgery within 3 month first dose study drug wound heal complication within 6 month first dose study drug wound complication . The following additional exclusion criterion patient enrol Expansion Cohort C : Uncontrolled blood pressure ( &gt; 140/90 ) . Patients blood pressure ≤140/90 take medical professional within one week start study Proteinuria &gt; 2+ urinalysis Serosal involvement bowel would render patient increase risk gastrointestinal perforation</criteria>
