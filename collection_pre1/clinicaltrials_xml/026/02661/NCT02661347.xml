	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Hallucinations First-Episode Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study look investigate whether patient recent onset psychosis may benefit tDCS treatment . The main hypothesis test study treatment risperidone supplement tDCS yield decrease auditory hallucination negative symptom ; improve work memory attention . To test hypothesis investigator enroll 30 patient recent-onset psychosis 16-week long randomize double blind control study risperidone treatment supplement tDCS versus risperidone plus sham tDCS . Patients present treatment first psychotic episode schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis eligible undergo already treatment risperidone , randomize either tDCS sham tDCS twice day five consecutive day . Neuropsychological testing , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) electroencephalogram ( EEG ) conduct baseline , week 1 ( completion tDCS sham tDCS intervention ) week 16 . Clinical interview ass symptom medical assessment side effect do baseline , weekly first four week every two week study completion . The primary outcome measure Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale ( AHRS ) score . Specific aim : To determine efficacy tDCS auditory hallucination patient first episode schizophrenia . The investigator hypothesize risperidone plus tDCS associate faster robust decrease auditory hallucination compare risperidone plus sham tDCS . To test efficacy tDCS cognitive negative symptom patient first episode schizophrenia . The investigator hypothesize tDCS improves work memory , attention/vigilance decrease negative symptom . To examine neuronal basis tDCS effect ameliorate auditory hallucination schizophrenia conduct event-related potential ( ERP ) rest state EEG . The investigator hypothesize Delta N-100 amplitude associate improvement auditory hallucination tDCS treatment . To determine effect tDCS brain structure function conduct structural MRI , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .</detailed_description>
