	<brief_summary>This study evaluate absorption two different dietary supplement contain omega 3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid docosahexaenoic acid 24 hour via venous blood plasma follow single dose take bed time . In addition , circadian rhythm fatty acid metabolism also assess follow placebo intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plasma Diurnal Variation Absorption EPA DHA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The bioavailability omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) influence number factor include chemical structure fatty acid bind form food matrix fatty acid consume . In addition , evidence animal lipid metabolism follow circadian pattern , although yet investigate human . The supplement produce soft gelatine capsule contain fish oil base high concentrate omega-3 fatty acid design improve bio availability via self-emulsifying drug delivery system ( SMEDDS ) . The in-situ formation emulsion occur spontaneously capsule erupts vivo SMEDDS solution come contact gastro-intestinal content . The size microdroplets form low micrometer range , advantage much large combined surface area compare drop oil result good access pancreatic lipase . The result free fatty acid may readily absorb passage upper small intestine result effective absorption oil . Therefore duel objective study determine bioavailability healthy middle age adult two formulation fish oil take bed time use SMEDDS evaluate diurnal variation background plasma fatty acid . All study visit take place 4th floor Northumberland Building , Northumbria University within suite facility comprise Nutrition Kitchen , Sleep Centre , Clinical space wait room Brain , Performance Nutrition Research Centre . Participants attend lab five separate occasion . The first visit screening/introductory visit . The Introductory visit laboratory comprise : providing participant 'participant information sheet ' , brief requirement study sign informed consent form completion Case Report Form ( CRF ; include self-reported health screen collection demographic data ) . Participants attend lab four study visit separate least 6 day , identical except treatment consume . On study visit participant arrive lab 19:30 consume nothing water least 2 hour prior arrival continued eligibility assess . A cannula insert vein arm non-dominant hand . The first blood sample collect immediately prior even meal serve 20:00 followed rest period . At 22:00 participant consume even 's treatment . Lights 22:30 . Blood sample draw every 2 hour night 00:00 , 02:00 04:00 . Participants wake 06:00 blood sample take straight away . Blood sample continue collect every two hour 22:00 cannula remove . Meals provide 07:00 , 12:00 , 16:00 20:00 , even meal exactly previous even . Participants ad libitum access water throughout study visit . They also allow consume tea coffee throughout day however content time hot drink consume first study visit replicate subsequent visit . Similarly , eat meal provide entirety , record replicate subsequent visit . In meal blood sample participant require remain within facility allow read , write , watch television listen music .</detailed_description>
