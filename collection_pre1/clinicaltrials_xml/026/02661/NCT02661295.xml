	<brief_title>A Study Ferric Citrate Improve Inflammation Lipid Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) receive dialysis , risk cardiovascular death estimate 10-100 time higher general population without renal disease . This due part high level inflammation vascular calcification ( large deposit calcium artery ) find patient . Chronic inflammation particularly common patient ESRD . Parenteral iron therapy , common patient dialysis , may contribute inflammation also high cardiovascular risk . Phosphate binder , particularly non-calcium base phosphate binder , may decrease cardiovascular risk decrease inflammation vascular calcification . In study 10,044 hemodialysis patient , treatment phosphate binder associate improved survival . Ferric citrate non-calcium base phosphate binder approximately 210 mg ferric iron recently approve patient hemodialysis . It show improve serum phosphorus level decrease intravenous iron requirement patient hemodialysis . The effect phosphate binder inflammation lipid level unknown investigator hypothesize ferric citrate potential improve inflammation lipid level patient hemodialysis decrease intravenous iron requirement improve lipid metabolism . Ferric citrate potential decrease cardiovascular risk multiple mechanism : 1. act non-calcium base binder decrease serum phosphorus level vascular calcification , 2. decrease intravenous iron requirement turn may decrease inflammation , 3. binding endotoxin ( harmful substance produce microorganism ) gut 4. improve lipid metabolism . The purpose study examine effect ferric citrate inflammatory marker lipid level .</detailed_description>
