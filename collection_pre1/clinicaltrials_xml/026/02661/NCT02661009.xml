	<brief_summary>In clinical trial , investigator select FFPE plasma sample non-small cell lung cancer use quantitative detection four kind EGFR ( Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ) mutation . By follow two aspect , investigator evaluate clinical performance EGFR quantitative kit . 1. methodology validation : To certify equivalence EGFR quantitative kit common use detection method . 2. analysis relationship type proportion EGFR sensitive mutation EGFR-TKI benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According type sample purpose study , research consist two group : plasma tissue match group predict clinical efficacy group . The sample plasma tissue match group period plasma match FFPE ( formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue ) sample collect first time patient accept anti-tumor treatment . The sample predict clinical efficacy group FFPE sample collect patient receive EGFR-TKI treatment . In addition , subject complete prognostic follow-up data .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Plasma tissue match group : 18~80 year old Diagnosis NSCLC ( stage III IV ) confirm histology cytology method . Did receive antitumor treatment . Sufficient sample analysis Female patient childbearing potential nursing pregnant . Samples collect patient receive antitumor treatment . The plasma sample hemolysis . Tumor cell find FFPE sample . Incomplete information subject predict clinical efficacy group : 18~80 year old Diagnosis NSCLC ( stage III IV ) confirm histology cytology method . At least one measurable focus With EGFRTKI treatment Complete followup information EGFRTKI treatment Sufficient sample analysis FFPE sample collect EGFRTKI treatment . Female patient childbearing potential nursing pregnant . Tumor cell find FFPE sample . Incomplete information subject</criteria>
