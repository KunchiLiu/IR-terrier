	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare physical fitness performance—as measure Air Force Physical Fitness Test ( PFT ) —of subject , conjunction exercise , take creatine supplementation four week period versus . Based literature , evidence support creatine supplementation may increase available level muscle phosphocreatine ( PCr ) , important energy reservoir initially expend intense muscular contraction regenerate episodes rest . While mechanistically plausible , effect creatine specific measure PFT ( push-ups , sit-ups , 1.5 mile run , abdominal circumference ) evaluate . The target population Active Duty Air Force ( ADAF ) service member perform satisfactory ( 75.0-89.9 ) , excellent ( ≥90.0 ) , category PFT . As , represent population room improvement risk , currently experience , negative impact AF career due level fitness . If short-term creatine supplementation help improve PFT score , trainer , commander , unit physician may wish consider recommend use . While generally consider safe , additional data also collect evaluate qualitative quantitative side-effects creatine supplementation study period . If hypothesis correct creatine supplementation show effective safe , additional study may warrant evaluate impact ADAF service member fail PFT and/or risk separate AF unsatisfactory fitness performance . In short , study potential dramatically affect recommendation practice ADAF service member relate use creatine supplementation .</detailed_description>
