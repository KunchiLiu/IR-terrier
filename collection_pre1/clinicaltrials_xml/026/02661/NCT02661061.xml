	<detailed_description>Participants recruit admission St Patrick 's University Hospital treatment Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , 4th Edition ( DSM-IV ) -diagnosed recurrent unipolar depression followed-up weekly ass recovery accord standard criterion . Blood sample epigenetic study take baseline . Treatment-as-usual continue throughout entire trial . Participants meet standardised response criterion invite randomise course four two-weekly ketamine midazolam ( active comparator ) infusion . Block randomisation independently perform . Physical , psychotomimetic cognitive outcome monitor , infusion . Blood sample take four time-points first infusion session final infusion neuroplasticity biomarker studies.Trial Interventions : participant receive four two-weekly infusion either ketamine 0.05mg/kg midazolam 0.045mg/kg . All infusion administer consultant anaesthetist . Repeated infusion ketamine show safe well-tolerated patient mental illness . Minor haemodynamic change psychotomimetic side-effects occur assess regularly infusion 200 minute afterwards . Participants follow six month ass relapse accord standardise criterion . This highest-risk period relapse investigator hypothesize ketamine provide additional neurotrophic support ( assessed laboratory biomarker project ) result low relapse rate compare midazolam .</detailed_description>
