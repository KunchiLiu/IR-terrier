	<detailed_description>Objectives : This study test usefulness GPS-enabled inhaler study association air pollution , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) exacerbation , physical activity . Specific aim 1 ) test feasibility use inhaler sensor measure worsen symptom exacerbation , 2 ) characterize physical activity patient COPD , 3 ) examine whether environmental factor link mild exacerbation measure inhaler sensor . Research Design : A 12-week observational , longitudinal pilot study patient COPD . Methodology : Participants recruit VA Puget Sound perform spirometry complete baseline questionnaire . An inhaler sensor place albuterol inhaler record time location inhaler actuation throughout three month follow-up . Each month participant answer question regard breathing symptom physical activity . Physical activity measure self-report use weeklong Physical Activity Checklist . A pedometer wear three 7 day period . Public use air pollution meteorological data link inhaler data . We compute descriptive statistic measure , include sociodemographics , exacerbation rate , inhaler use , air pollution exposures physical activity level . In addition , time series analysis use test frequency inhaler use associate high level daily air pollution .</detailed_description>
