	<brief_title>SL-401 Combination With Pomalidomide Dexamethasone Relapsed Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase 1/2 , Open Label Study SL-401 Combination Pomalidomide Dexamethasone In Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma . This study Phase 1/2 multi center , open label study SL-401 combination standard dose Pomalidomide Dexamethasone . The study conduct 2 Phases : Phase 1 dose escalation Phase determine MTD maximum test dose SL-401 combination standard dose Pomalidomide Dexamethasone . In Phase 1 , evaluate SL-401 dose level incorporate initial `` Run-in Cycle '' ( i.e . cycle 1 ) single agent SL-401 least 3 patient ; follow Run-in Cycle , patient experience DLT receive combination SL-401/Pomalidomide Dexamethasone cycle 2 beyond . All patient Phase 2 initiate therapy combination SL-401/Pomalidomide Dexamethasone maximum test dose establish Phase 1 manner ( i.e . SL-401 alone cycle 1 follow combination SL-401 Pomalidomide Dexamethasone cycle 2 beyond ) .</detailed_description>
