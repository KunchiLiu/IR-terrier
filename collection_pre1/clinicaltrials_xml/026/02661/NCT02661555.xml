	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) physically cognitively disable , chronic autoimmune disease unknown etiology . It common neurological disease affect young adult Western country . According Danish MS Registry prevalence increase markedly last 40 year particularly woman , today approximately 14.000 patient MS ( PwMS ) Denmark . The pathological hallmark MS sclerotic plaque . Plaques central nervous system ( CNS ) detect vivo use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Both accumulation lesion accelerate whole-brain atrophy correlate progress physical cognitive disability clinically characterize PwMS . The disease cause damage white grey matter CNS , lead whole brain atrophy topographically specific atrophy within hippocampus frontal temporal cortex . The degradation CNS manifest cognitive physical disability . Cognitive impairment estimate affect 65 % PwMS , make one common disabling symptom MS. Medical therapy cognitive impairment MS far prove ineffective . Collectively , prevalence , impact miss treatment highlight importance alternative approach towards preservation cognitive function . Despite equivocal finding , aerobic exercise represent promise approach towards preservation even expansion hippocampal volume cognitive function MS. No longitudinal randomize control trial ( RCT ) study far applied MRI technique evaluate potential neuro-protective effect exercise brain structure function MS. Also , give scarcity effective treatment cognitive impairment MS , longitudinal exercise intervention evaluate potential effect aerobic exercise cognition urgently need MS . The purpose present project investigate aerobic exercise affect brain volume , specific brain region , neurotrophins cognition PwMS . It hypothesize aerobic exercise slow brain atrophy , increase size hippocampus , upregulate secretion neurotrophins improve cognitive performance people MS . The study single blind RCT . The exercise intervention contain 6 month aerobic training ( bicycling , row cross trainer ) perform two time week moderate high intensity supervision . The control group `` live usual '' offer exercise intervention 6 month period . A total approximately 85 PwMS expect enrol . The primary outcome study brain atrophy determine MRI . The current interdisciplinary project aim document understand possible neuro-protective effect exercise MS . This would high relevance PwMS ( neurological pathology ) . From societal perspective would help optimize MS rehabilitation subsequently reduce MS related cost due disability . In case positive finding , would provide first convince human evidence disease modify effect exercise MS .</detailed_description>
