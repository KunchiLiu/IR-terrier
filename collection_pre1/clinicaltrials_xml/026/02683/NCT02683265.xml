At Visit 6 , clinical status ( include AEs ) assess ADHD-RS-IV CGI-S CGI-I administer . Criteria continuation Open-Label Phase less 30 % improvement Screening total score Investigator administer ADHD-RS-IV ( Preschool Version ) 11 Clinical Global Impression-Improvement ( CGI-I ) 3 ( minimally improve less ) . For patient still eligible continuation Open-Label Phase , medical evaluation conduct , include vital sign , collection blood routine blood chemistry/hematology assessment .

An optimal dose dose produce reduction Visit 7 ADHD symptom least 30 % CGI-I compare Visit 7 `` much improve '' `` much improve '' tolerable side effect . Subjects meet improvement criterion may benefit additional dose increase , may dose optimize . If high dose tolerate , subject may step one dose level . See Section 6.1.1 detailed list procedure . Phase 5 : Two-week Double-Blind phase Eligible subject find optimized dose Phase 4 , see , randomize receive best dose Aptensio XR® match placebo enter two-week parallel Double-Blind Phase . Blinded study drug dispense visit 13 double-blind treatment follow morning Visit 13 . Subjects ≥50 % worsen symptom ADHD-RS-IV Visit 14 ( compare Visit 13 , one week Double-Blind Phase ) CGI-I `` much bad '' `` much bad '' compare Visit 13 eligible discontinue Double-Blind Phase enter Open-Label Extension Study investigator 's discretion , complete end study ( Visit 15 ) procedure . At study Visit 15 , ADHD-RS-IV , CGI-S , CGI-I , adverse event collection physical exam repeat along ECG .
