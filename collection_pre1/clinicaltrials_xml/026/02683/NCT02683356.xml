	<brief_summary>Fully Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds ( BVS ) introduce objective preserve native vessel geometry , allow adaptive vessel remodel late lumen gain , restore physiological vasomotion , avoid late adverse event include restenosis scaffold thrombosis . Although randomized clinical trial low risk patient date suggest non-inferiority term safety efficacy compare metallic DES , several report raise concern regard scaffold thrombosis highlight importance technical consideration regard lesion preparation scaffold expansion . OCT offer opportunity plan procedure optimize implantation BVS . The hypothesis present study strategy OCT-guided PCI use BVS superior angiography-guided PCI ( e.g . select scaffold dimension basis pre-procedural OCT apply corrective measure case suboptimal treatment result indicate OCT ) .</brief_summary>
