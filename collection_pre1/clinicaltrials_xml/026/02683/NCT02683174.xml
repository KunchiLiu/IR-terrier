	<brief_title>Diagnostic Yield Ambulatory Patch Monitor Unexplained Emergency Department Syncope : A Pilot Study ( PATCH-ED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There around 650,000 ED syncope presentation year United Kingdom ( UK ) . Serious underlying condition present syncope one-month serious adverse outcome around 7 % 50 % cardiovascular . The treat ED clinician always able rule serious pathology patient commonly fully recover arrival ED , despite underlying cause potentially life threaten recur . Whilst patient serious underlying cause therefore require hospitalisation , concern ED clinician miss serious underlie cause ( especially cardiovascular one ) mean 50 % syncope patient admit hospital . Despite research identify high-risk demographic , historical examination variable , clinical decision rule well adopt due lack sensitivity specificity probably due vary heterogeneous nature potentially serious cause . Rather continue attempt risk stratification outcome base presentation , research require well improve diagnosis therefore treatment order provide improve patient benefit . Cardiovascular cause syncope fall two main category , arrhythmia ( e.g . ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) , 2nd degree Mobitz II , 3rd degree atrioventricular block symptomatic bradycardia ) structural ( e.g . aortic stenosis ) . It arrhythmia difficult ED clinician diagnose ED examination present Electrocardiogram ECG may normal . It reason arrhythmia make large number subsequent serious outcome syncope patient whose syncopal cause unexplained ED assessment . The current main method establish cardiac arrhythmia cause syncope rest correlation arrhythmia symptom ( resolved time patient get ED ) . The clinical challenge ED therefore identify moderate high-risk patient refer investigation monitoring appropriate . The logistics arrange follow within timely period patient 's ED visit often problematic variety reason include availability timely specialty outpatient appointment , lack consensus specialty syncope patient refer ( cardiology , medicine , neurology , general practice ) availability Holter monitoring device . For reason high medium risk patient admit hospital . The investigation cardiac arrhythmia usually initiate Holter monitor use continuous record 24 48-hour period . The Holter allow detection baseline rhythm , arrhythmia conduction abnormality . Holters however bulky inconvenient patient wear , transmission data patient dependent non-compliance device use maintain write symptom log , limit diagnostic utility . The lack extend monitoring reduces diagnostic yield typically less 20 % . Bass report diagnostic yield 15 % 24-hour Holter monitoring increase even device apply 72 hour . For reason , use Holter monitor universal medium high-risk syncope patient . In one UK ED study , 158 540 ( 29 % ) admit syncope patient underwent 24 hour monitoring ( majority comprise ward telemetry rather Holter ) . There device available Cardiologist investigate syncope patient classified European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) medium high-risk whose Holter investigation unrevealing . Event recorder record continuous ECG require patient activation time symptom must apply chest wall time event must activate patient . A brief , typically 90-second , single lead ECG recording capture store . Because limited data storage capability , data must transmit monitoring centre validation analysis . Event recorder use cardiac monitoring long period time big drawback must activate follow symptom onset , may difficult achieve patient suffer syncope injury relate event . Finally , device use document asymptomatic arrhythmia . External continuous loop recorder attach patient chest electrode wristband . They continuously record ECG save data activate patient . The continuous loop memory feature allow device store fixed length pre-activation post-event ECG data . Mobile cardiac telemetry system provide 30 day real-time continuous cardiac monitoring without need patient activation data transmission . These device expensive , require electrode bulky record device , produce large amount data , require sift . Implantable loop recorder surgically implant subcutaneous device continuously record single-lead ECG signal 2 electrode . They expensive necessitate invasive surgical procedure . For patient admitted hospital place telemetry , also lack consensus optimal duration monitoring . Typically high risk patient monitor 24 hour discharge without diagnosis ECG trace uneventful time period . In order solve problem , novel ambulatory cardiac monitoring device easily apply ED patient recently develop . The ZIO®XT Patch ( iRhythm Technologies , Inc. San Francisco , California ; http : //www.irhythmtech.com/zio-services.php ) non-invasive , water-resistant , lead wire , discrete wear approved clinical use UK . It continuously monitor heart 14 day include sleep , shower , moderate exercise large button top patient capture symptomatic event . When patient reach end monitoring period , simply mail device back company analysis undertaken . The ZIO®XT Patch well tolerate prolonged monitoring compliance excellent study demonstrate mean monitoring wear time 10.8 day ( range 4-14 day ) 10.9 day ( median 13.0 day ) . Barrett et al show 80 % patient worn Holter monitor 24 hour , ZIO®XT Patch 14 day , preferred ZIO Patch . Single channel ECG data quality also excellent one study show 98 % total recording time analysable , second study show median analysable time 99 % total wear time . Compliance return device also good . In study 174 ED indication monitoring ( syncope , dizziness palpitation ) , patient mail back device . Several study show ZIO®XT Patch high diagnostic yield arrhythmias traditional 24-48 hour Holter monitoring importantly also efficiently characterise symptomatic patient without significant arrhythmia . The absence arrhythmia syncope , palpitation trigger event provide definitive diagnosis allow clinician exclude arrhythmia potential cause thus clinically useful . Over half patient ( 53.4 % ) one study arrhythmia despite triggered event . This allow clinician potentially exclude arrhythmia etiology patient 's symptom potentially avoid cardiac evaluation . Camm et al show study patient arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia ( ARVD ) , total wear time device , ZIO®XT Patch detect premature ventricular contraction event 24 hour Holter monitor . Barrett et al show ZIO®XT Patch 57 % great diagnostic yield 24 hour Holter monitor , Schreiber al demonstrate overall diagnostic yield 63 % ED patient indication monitor . This study also show 48 % patient ≥1 arrhythmia 10 % symptomatic time arrhythmia . Median time first arrhythmia 1.0 day ( IQR 0.2-2.8 ) median time first symptomatic arrhythmia 1.5 day ( IQR 0.4-6.7 ) . 54 % symptomatic patient arrhythmia triggered event . In study look ZIO®XT Patch use outpatient clinical indication monitoring ( 15 % syncope ) , 60 % patient arrhythmia detect , 30 % first arrhythmia 51 % first symptom-triggered arrhythmia occur initial 48-hour period . Mean time first arrhythmia 1.7 day ( median 0.8 ) mean time first symptomatic arrhythmia 3.0 day ( median 2.1 ) . This novel ambulatory cardiac monitoring device allow much early arrhythmia detection patient allow good diagnosis subsequent treatment .</detailed_description>
