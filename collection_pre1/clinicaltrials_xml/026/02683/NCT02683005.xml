	<brief_summary>Sofosbuvir ledipasvir ( LDV/SOF ) new directly act antiviral drug treatment hepatitis C ( HCV ) highly effective , orally administer , well tolerated preclinical evaluation animal model indicate safe administration pregnancy . This project evaluate safety pharmacokinetics antenatal LDV/SOF treatment 12 week second third trimester . If proven effective , antenatal treatment HCV LDV/SOF prevent maternal HCV-related liver disease , perinatal transmission HCV , community transmission HCV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Hepatitis C Treatment During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 3.2 million person United States chronically infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) 1-2.4 % prevalence pregnancy . The recent October 2014 approval fix dose combination , contain NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir ( SOF ) 90 mg NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir ( LDV ) 400mg , mark new era IFN ribavirin free , directly act antiviral treatment HCV . A 12 week treatment course LDV/SOF result 99 % cure rate give once-a-day oral pill . Based animal model data submit FDA , drug combination give pregnancy category B designation , even though currently experience LDV/SOF pregnant woman . Pregnancy time woman uniquely motivated engage activity gear toward improvement health ensure health unborn child . As , pregnant woman frequent prenatal care visit ; health care intervention , antiviral therapy monitoring , easily integrate exist healthcare infrastructure prenatal care . The benefit HCV treatment numerous , include prevention severe liver disease , hepatocellular carcinoma , liver transplantation , well improvement physical , emotional social health . The recent guideline Infectious Disease Society America recommend HCV-infected person receive treatment . The antenatal period represent ideal window opportunity treatment HCV pregnancy due increase antenatal health care utilization prevention perinatal transmission HCV infant . Safe administration drug pregnancy may require dose adjustment due pregnancy-induced physiologic alternation . Therefore , careful pharmacokinetic ( PK ) evaluation critical first step ensure safe administration drug mother develop fetus . This single-arm , single-center , open label Phase 1 evaluation PK safety treat HCV 12 week course LDV/SOF 15 HCV-infected pregnant woman . Therapy initiate approximately 24 week gestation . In study determine : 1 ) PK LDV SOF similar pregnancy compare nonpregnant woman , 2 ) viral response LDV/SOF treatment pregnancy similar observe nonpregnant woman , 3 ) initial maternal neonatal safety concern detect antenatal LDV/SOF administration compare HCV-infected historical control deliver institution . From finding study , future study seek optimize dose , gestational age timing treatment duration LDV/SOF pregnancy . Antenatal HCV treatment improve maternal health , prevent HCV transmission community perinatal HCV transmission child , thus enhance long-term health two generation .</detailed_description>
