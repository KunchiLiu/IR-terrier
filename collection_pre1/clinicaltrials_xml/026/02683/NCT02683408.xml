	<detailed_description>Raynaud 's phenomenon disorder characterize spasm digital artery lead blanching , coldness discomfort affect digit , affect 3-5 % population time live . Raynaud 's roughly classified primary secondary form . The primary form may occur without apparent cause follow thing acute trauma , repetitive vibrate trauma frostbite . Secondary Raynaud 's occurs association variety systemic immunological disease rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , systemic sclerosis ( SS ) Sjogren 's syndrome . Perhaps severe form associate systemic sclerosis , less often SLE severe microvascular change lead digital ulceration difficult heal produce considerable functional impairment Treatment Raynaud 's significant clinical challenge . The primary modality avoid cold exposure . Many drug class show , highly variable potential toxicity . Diosmiplex prescription medical food product compose botanical base flavonoid molecule , diosmin , proprietary systemic blood alkalinize agent , Alka4-complex . Diosmin use successfully Europe drug chronic venous insufficiency complication , include venous ulcer 35 year . There large body publish literature regard molecular activity , clinical efficacy safety active molecule diosmin well effect microvasculature show reduce inflammation , improve structural integrity , reduce capillary damage improve capillary flow prospective clinical study publish regard effect Raynaud 's phenomenon . This first prospective study examine efficacy safety diosmin , diosmiplex , primary secondary Raynaud 's . The study intentionally seek enroll subset subject scleroderma Raynaud 's complicated digital ulcer . This two ( 2 ) month randomize , double blind , placebo control study . Patients either primary secondary Raynaud 's phenomenon present least 12 month either untreated inadequately control therapy , define least four ( 4 ) vasospastic episodes/week , eligible enrollment</detailed_description>
