Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 10 mm CT scan , ≥ 20 mm chest xray , ≥ 10 mm caliper clinical exam . At least 16 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Normal bone marrow organ function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 50,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine ≤ IULN OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Patients use antiestrogens oral birth control ineligible . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . A history malignancy ≤ 3 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Currently receive investigational agent . Known brain metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis must exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition DHEA agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
