	<detailed_description>The proportion old acute care physician ( ACP ) , emergency , critical care &amp; anesthesia , steadily increase . Ageing associate physiological change , turn influence physician 's clinical ability decision-making . The litigation physician disciplinary data suggest incident involve physician likely occur later practice , degree injury identify claim great severity . However research , investigate age-related physiological change affect clinical performance patient safety , lack . CRM skills essential skill within acute care specialty , vital patient safety . CRM encompass technical skill , well rapid organize approach non-technical , cognitive skill decision-making , task management , situational awareness team management . High-fidelity full body mannequin simulation-based education effective learning CRM , include transfer skill simulate set clinical set improve patient outcome . However , gap literature whether physician ' age influence baseline CRM performance also learn simulation-based education . Although effectiveness high-fidelity simulation-based education study extensively junior learner population ( student , resident , fellow ) , limited number study investigate effectiveness teach CRM age physician population.19 In fact , recent systematic review look role simulation continue medical education ( CME ) ACPs support limited evidence support improve learning.20 Despite know whether simulation correct tool age population , recommend training , regulation assessment tool practice physician . Objectives : The goal study : 1 . Investigate whether age correlation baseline CRM skills ACPs use simulated crisis scenario 2 . Assess whether age influence learn high fidelity simulation .</detailed_description>
