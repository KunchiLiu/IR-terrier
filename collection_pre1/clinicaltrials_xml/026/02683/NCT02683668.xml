	<detailed_description>Patients asthma chronic obstructive airway disease ( COPD ) undergo routine testing lung function diagnosis , progression , management , response treatment disease . Standard lung function obtain measurement base force flow air move within airway . Such measurement give reasonable assessment disease affect large airway , accurate estimate small airway disease . Small airways less 2mm diameter . However , asthma COPD disease involve large also small airway important clinical consequence . Indeed , COPD predominantly affect small airway . Tiotropium ( Spiriva , Boehringer Ingelheim ) , long-acting inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilator , improve lung function , quality life , exercise endurance reduces exacerbation patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Respimat Soft MistTM Inhaler ( SMI ) novel inhaler delivering unique slow-moving Soft MistTM allow gentle inhalation - make easy inhale . Importantly drug particle ~ 2microns allow increase total lung deposition drug ( ~52 % ) also potential penetration treat small large airway patient COPD ; target whole airway tree . RESEARCH AIM &amp; HYPOTHESIS The aim investigate effect tiotropium different device panel small ( IOS , MBNW , DLCO , FVC ) large airway ( FEV1 , PEF ) responses patient mild-moderate COPD . The investigator compare Tiotropium Handihaler 18 microgram daily Tiotropium Respimat 5 microgram daily . The investigator identify COPD cohort ongoing symptom exercise limitation HandiHaler , propose . The science behind people still limit ( even partially determine use CAT score ) distal airway target necessary ? This n't necessarily mean target acinar/alveolar beyond terminal bronchiole , little bit deep distal conduct airway . This achieved Respimat .</detailed_description>
