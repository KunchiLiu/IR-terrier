	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common condition still lack reliable , objective screen test . Many anatomical aspect syndrome study include dimension carpal tunnel shape nerve within tunnel . The investigator observe vary amount muscle overlie carpal tunnel patient undergo surgery condition . Assuming muscle may dynamic role development condition , investigator attempt quantify muscle use ultrasound ( US ) . The purpose study devise technique evaluate amount muscle overlie carpal tunnel .

	<brief_title>The Use Ultrasound Quantify Muscle Overlying Carpal Tunnel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : The pathophysiology carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) probability multifactorial include many parameter ultimately increase pressure within carpal tunnel . It likely increase pressure cause injury median nerve sign symptom CTS . The relationship size dimension hand occurrence CTS evaluate `` square-shaped '' hand also examine determine increase tendency develop CTS . The literature remain inconclusive time . Other static anatomical parameter evaluate include size carpal tunnel thickness biomechanical property transverse carpal ligament without absolute consensus literature . Additional study evaluate role intrinsic musculature within surround carpal tunnel etiology CTS . Most study evaluate muscle space occupy lesion add pressure within carpal tunnel . The investigator believe muscle describe , specifically find within transverse carpal ligament cross area carpal tunnel , actually dynamic role etiology CTS , especially manual laborer use hand forceful manner repetitive fashion . It also possible anatomic variant ( muscle cross area carpal tunnel ) relate `` square `` hand configuration dynamic contribution pressure within carpal tunnel reason increase incidence CTS patient . The purpose study quantify amount muscle cross area carpal tunnel normal individual compare amount muscle wrists patient CTS . Hypothesis : Participants CTS muscle cross carpal tunnel normal control ( without CTS ) . Purpose : To compare amount muscle cross carpal tunnel normal control ( without CTS ) patient CTS Specific aim : 1 . To develop system quantify amount muscle cross carpal tunnel area use ultrasound wrist area . 2 . To compare measurement normal wrist wrists CTS 3 . To compare measurement CTS patient intraoperative evaluation amount muscle cross carpal tunnel area . 4 . To compare measurement external measurement hand ( palm width/palm length ) Methods : Fifty participant recruit study . Twenty five participant CTS- twenty five CTS . The CTS group inclusion criterion : The diagnosis CTS include : 1 . Signs symptoms CTS : nighttime numbness tingle numbness tingle median nerve distribution positive phalen tinel forearm compression test 2 . A nerve conduction test electromyography ( NCT EMG ) positive CTS . The participant without CTS inclusion criterion : 1 ) Individuals sign symptom CTS . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Individuals know history peripheral neuropathy condition hand include recent significant trauma . 2 . Patients incomplete unclear evaluation test . 3 . Individuals unwilling sign consent form participate study . Patients meet inclusion criterion send carpal tunnel release surgery consent examined day surgery . Their US result , external palmar measurement well amount overlie muscle record well demographic data . Demographic information , occupational history , history hand diagnose procedure well history pertinent CTS ( nighttime numbness tingling , pain , perceive pinch weakness , duration symptom ) collect . Results nerve conduction test ( NCT ) record . Physical examination finding pertinent CTS collect include pinch strength , grip strength , 2-point discrimination , hand measurement palm width ( PW ) , palm length ( PL ) . External measurement : PL measure vertical length midline distal wrist crease proximal middle finger . PW measure horizontal length base 1st metacarpophalangeal ( MP ) joint along proximal palmar crease .</detailed_description>
