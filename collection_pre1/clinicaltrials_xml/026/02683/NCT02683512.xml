	<brief_title>Glycogen Storage Disease Type IV Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long term goal propose project develop repository information long term goal expand understanding disease manifestation natural history GSD IV . Specific Aims : To establish repository clinical , laboratory , biochemical information individual diagnose glycogen brancher enzyme deficiency . In long term , information permit well understand long term complication clinical course GBE deficiency . The medical record review participant information collect use REDCapâ„¢ software , host Duke Translational Medicine Institute ( DTMI ) . The database serve repository retrospective prospective clinical information result participant . Data collect : Name , DOB , Sex , Age , Method diagnosis , Liver , skin , muscle biopsy histology , Initial symptom and/or reason referral , Past medical history , Past surgical history , Family history , Pregnancy history , Developmental history , Developmental assessment , Results liver function testing . All patient GSD-IV regardless age , gender ethnicity , eligible database . This research project enroll individual outside institution . The goal increase robustness data collection analysis large number participant .</detailed_description>
