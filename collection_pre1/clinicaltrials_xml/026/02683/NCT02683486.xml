	<brief_summary>The aim study ass whether auto-titrating oxygen system maintain constant oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) patient long-term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) activity daily live . Currently LTOT provide constant fixed-flow rate e.g . 2 litre per minute time appropriate assessment . The flow rate change usual household activity increase walking . A number study investigate SpO2 patient LTOT daytime patient ' home . The result show patient ' SpO2 decrease intermittently whilst activity daily live watch television , put away shopping , shower bath dress undressing . This problem lead breathlessness , increase stress heart affect brain function . In order correct drop SpO2 patient experience everyday activity , investigator develop oxygen system , automatically change amount oxygen deliver depend patient ' oxygen saturation - auto-titrating oxygen system . In study , patient LTOT ask simulate series activity daily live twice : whilst usual fixed-flow oxygen therapy auto-titrating oxygen system . The activity carry hospital setting . During activity , SpO2 record continuously . The main outcome interest study SpO2 throughout study fixed-flow oxygen auto-titrating oxygen system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Long-term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) prescribe patient stable severe hypoxemic respiratory failure accord specific criterion set different guideline international respiratory society . The aim LTOT maintain rest partial pressure oxygen ( PO2 ) &gt; 60 mmHg oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) &gt; 90 % . A number study demonstrate whilst home , patient LTOT experience episode intermittent hypoxia ( SpO2 &lt; 90 % ) spend significant amount time SpO2 &lt; 90 % . These episode desaturation occur frequently activity daily live may harmful could lead pulmonary hypertension , arrhythmias ischaemic heart disease . Simply increase LTOT flow rate 1 2 litre one option expose patient hyperoxaemia risk hypercapnia . An another method optimise LTOT utilise auto-titrating oxygen system . These system allow close control SpO2 automatically adjust flow oxygen match target SpO2 . At Royal Brompton Hospital Imperial College London , investigator develop auto-titrating oxygen system - call intelligent oxygen therapy ( iO2t ) . This system test patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) LTOT 6 minute walk test promising result ( ERS 2015 ) . The aim study investigate whether intelligent oxygen therapy system reduce intermittent hypoxia patient LTOT simulate activity daily live . Patients ask series activity daily live period 1 hour include : washing , dress , put away shop clean . The patient activity twice : usual LTOT auto-titrating oxygen system cross-over design .</detailed_description>
