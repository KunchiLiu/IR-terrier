	<brief_title>Investigation Safety Efficacy NTCELL® Immunoprotected ( Alginate-Encapsulated ) Porcine Choroid Plexus Cells Xenotransplantation Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease characterize widespread neural degeneration , particularly substantia nigra projection basal ganglia . Current therapy Parkinson 's disease purely symptomatic . There press need treatment reverse slow degeneration nigrostriatal pathway . Numerous transplant-based therapy attempt support , repair replace degenerate nigrostriatal neuron . These included transplantation foetal neuronal stem cell , gene transfer , implantation device release neural growth factor . All show effectiveness animal model , generally disappointing human study . Intracranial choroid plexus cell transplantation potential deliver biological neural agent treatment Parkinson 's disease achieve conventional treatment . The overall aim deliver neural protein compound many month basal ganglia brain enhance neural repair currently possible antiparkinsonian medication deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) . As animal-derived tissue protect immune rejection transplant human , transplant usually accompany immunosuppressive therapy . However , porcine choroid plexus cell preferably implant without use immunosuppressive drug cause significant morbidity . To protect immune rejection , cell encapsulate alginate microcapsules permit inward passage nutrient outward passage biologic neural protein compound normally secrete choroid plexus cell . Alginate-encapsulated porcine choroid plexus cell implant brain without immunosuppressive drug survive rejection many month animal study . NTCELL comprise neonatal porcine choroid plexus cell encapsulate alginate microcapsules . The bilateral dose administer 18 patient ( initially 3 group 6 patient , randomise 4:2 NTCELL : sham surgery ) enrol trial total twice human equivalent dose administer unilaterally LCT 's non-human primate study . Thus 240 NTCELL microcapsules ( ± 5 % ) administer side brain . If significant safety issue implantation first group patient , second group patient schedule receive implant NTCELL . If significant safety issue implantation second group patient , third group patient schedule receive implant NTCELL . This study adopt adaptive design respect choice dose NTCELL fourth group patient ( patient originally receive sham surgery Groups 1-3 ) . Following unblinding study Groups 1-3 reach 26-week follow-up , interim analysis , safety efficacy , undertaken . If significant safety issue , last group patient , Group 4 , ( originally receive sham surgery ) schedule receive NTCELL implant . The dose NTCELL give determine DSMB follow proposal Principal Investigator , base result interim analysis . Parkinson 's disease patient follow 26 week receive either implantation NTCELL sham surgery .</detailed_description>
