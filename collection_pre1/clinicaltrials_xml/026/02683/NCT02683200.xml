	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -guided stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) treat patient liver metastasis liver cancer . SBRT specialized radiation therapy delivers single , high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Combining MRI SBRT may help doctor highlight tissue surround tumor well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI-Guided Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Liver Metastases Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility utilize MRI-guided tri-60Co teletherapy system liver SBRT , determine treat radiation oncologist 's ability accurately visualize align target lesion ( ) . II . To assess feasibility use three versus five fraction scheme , one versus multiple ( i.e. , = &lt; 5 ) target lesion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tumor local control ( LC ) , disease specific survival ( DSS ) , overall survival ( OS ) . II . To gather biomarkers may elucidate differential immunogenic response three versus five fraction SBRT regimens . OUTLINE : Patients undergo MRI-guided Tri-60Co teletherapy SBRT 3-5 fraction 1-2 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow approximately 4-6 week , every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
