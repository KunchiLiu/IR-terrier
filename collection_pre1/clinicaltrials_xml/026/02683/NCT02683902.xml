	<brief_title>The Effect Hypocaloric Diet Associated With tDCS Weight Loss Metabolic Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order ass whether tDCS treatment associate reduce caloric diet improve weight loss , overweight obese subject recruit advertisement web page Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital , local newspaper television , refer doctor nutritionist , external HCPA service . After screen selection , patient undergo clinical , laboratory nutritional evaluation . There standard assessment protocol include : complete clinical evaluation socioeconomic status , assessment physical activity , questionnaires quality life , sleep , depression anxiety body composition assessment . In laboratory evaluation biochemistry exam include oral glucose tolerance test ( OGGT 75g ) , meal tolerance test ( MTT ) , serum glucose , Cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , glycated hemoglobin glycated albumin . The rest metabolic rate determine indirect calorimetry . Besides , 100-mm visual-analog scale use measure self-reported rating appetite , hunger , satiety food craving . Patients also prescribe low caloric diet individual counseling dietician order reduce 3 % initial weight 4-week treatment . Moreover , one tDCS session day ( active sham stimulation previous randomization ) 5 consecutive day , four week treatment ( 20 session ) . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive method brain stimulation small current apply scalp . This technique use weak safety current 2 milliampere ( mA ) 20 minute may increase ( anodal tDCS ) decrease ( cathodal tDCS ) cortical excitability . During tDCS session , film image food usually elicit crave presented end session , visual analog scale apply assess hunger , satiety presence food craving . Finally , attention mood scale apply periodically addition questionnaire adverse effect use tDCS . At end 4-week diet tDCS , patient submit clinical , laboratory , nutrition feed behavior exam apply baseline . Finally , participant come 3 6 month end protocol reassessment weight , body composition bioelectrical impedance answer questionnaire</detailed_description>
