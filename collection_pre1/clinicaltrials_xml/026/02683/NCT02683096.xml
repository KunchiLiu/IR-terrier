	<detailed_description>Congenital cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection lead non-genetic cause sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL ) child United States , frequent know viral cause mental disability . Approximately one percent newborn infant United States infect CMV . Of infected , approximately 10 % involvement evident birth ( symptomatic congenital CMV disease ) manifestation include microcephaly , central nervous system abnormality , chorioretinitis , hepatosplenomegaly , SNHL . The common sequela follow congenital CMV infection SNHL occur 50 % infant symptomatic congenital CMV infection 15 % asymptomatic infant . Overall , congenital CMV infection account one-third case SNHL . Among newborn infant fail hear screening , prevalence congenital CMV infection much high ( six 10 % ) general newborn population ( &lt; 1 % ) . Since early therapeutic intervention infant symptomatic congenital CMV infection improve audiological neurodevelopmental outcome early diagnosis essential early treatment maximize infant outcome . The Illinois Legislature pass bill sign law August 2015 Governor Rauner regard congenital CMV . The main objective law public education regard CMV infection effort raise awareness infection amongst healthcare provider care expectant mother . This Public Act mandate parent receive information regard test opportunity early intervention service CMV infection newborn infant fail hear screen . Although bill mandate CMV screening , state hospital provide information testing option . Our central hypothesis screen newborn infant either fail newborn hear test diagnosis small gestational age ( SGA ) lead good identification infant congenital CMV infection enhance rate therapeutic intervention . This potential significantly improve outcome infant common viral infection . This particular cohort patient well study locally regionally . In addition , view current legislation effective January , 2016 timely project provide preliminary data future statewide recommendation around CMV test newborn infant . This pilot/feasibility study obtain preliminary data Illinois Department Public Health ( IDPH ) Title V grant .
