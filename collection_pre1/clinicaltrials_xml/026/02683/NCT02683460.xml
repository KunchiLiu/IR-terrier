	<brief_summary>This study aim compare clinical result patella resurface subvastus approach total knee arthroplasty . Even though excellent result total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , persistent controversy whether replace patella . Anterior knee pain continue unsolved problem TKA patient . Some surgeon always perform patella resurface total knee arthroplasty others n't . It 's surgeon 's preference . There several study patellar resurface TKA . But previous study almost do approach , subvastus approach . This study prospectively randomize patient receive bilateral TKA patellar resurface knee . Patients preference clinical result investigate knee patient receive patellar resurface minimum 2 year follow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patellar Resurfacing Under Subvastus Approach Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective work compare pain , stiffness function group minimum 2 year postoperatively . Secondarily , compare pain , patient preference minimum 2 year postoperatively . The investigator hypothesize would difference two group subject measure outcome . Patients receive TKA prospectively enrol surgery randomize intraoperatively either receive patella replacement knee patient . Subjects assess pre-operatively 6 month , 1 , 2 year postoperatively pain , function , stiffness use disease-specific ( Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index [ WOMAC ] ) . Other measurement like Knee Society score , Feller 's score , Patient satisfaction ( VAS ) also check pre-operatively 6 month , 1 , 2 year postoperatively .</detailed_description>
