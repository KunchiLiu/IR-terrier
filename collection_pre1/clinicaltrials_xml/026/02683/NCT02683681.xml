	<detailed_description>After inform consent obtain patient , blood sample obtain either procedure access line insert procedure drawn order lab work do specific time point . While blood sample collection prefer , require , decision collect blood sample leave discretion investigator . - Tissue sample obtain time LVAD implantation keep part leave ventricular apex surgeon remove order place inflow cannula LVAD . No extra tissue sample tissue remove part standard LVAD operation need obtain . - Tissue sample acquire fail heart time heart transplantation , excise donor heart implant place . - Control tissue sample acquire intraoperatively cardiac surgery wherein amount excise tissue routinely discard . In case , patient exist LVAD implant destination therapy , eligible cardiac transplant , schedule cardiac surgery foreseeable future , patient approach consent blood sample . In addition , consent obtain intraoperative tissue sample request event cardiac surgery occur and/or device explanted reason future .</detailed_description>
