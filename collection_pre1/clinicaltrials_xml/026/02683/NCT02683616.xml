	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSA ) disease affect 5-15 % population 50-80 % type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) obese subject . OSA causally contribute development glucose intolerance T2DM . The project target gap provide effective treatment metabolic impairment associate OSA , particularly T2DM . In contrast prove benefit OSA treatment CPAP ( continuous positive airway pressure ) cardiovascular morbidity/mortality , study impact CPAP diabetes control disappoint . In fact , OSA-induced metabolic impairment might reversible CPAP treatment , investigator suggest recently . Clearly , search additional treatment , probably pharmacological , warranted . Investigators hypothesize elevated level free fatty acid ( FFA ) , detect OSA patient , link OSA T2DM development . The aim study target adipose tissue muscle dysfunction lead elevate FFA develop thus novel pharmacological treatment base lipolysis inhibition stimulation FFA oxidation .</brief_summary>
