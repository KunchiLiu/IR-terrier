	<brief_summary>The aim study assess marginal fit follow preparation finish ultrasonic tip porcelain veneer compare ordinary preparation use bur . Two-hundred forty crown prepare receive porcelain veneer ( split-mouth design ) . On one side mouth , prepared surface finish ultrasonic tip . Marginal fit measure 'cement replica technique ' .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All-ceramic restoration increase daily routine treatment although remain less popular metal-ceramic crown especially cost metal rise aesthetic request people increase The increased demand aesthetic treatment lead widespread use metal-free ceramic conservative restoration . Whilst study clinical porcelain restoration clarifies satisfactory success rate describe reason failure due advance technique material use dental restoration . All-ceramic restoration failure due several reason , restoration fracture , discoloration marginal area , marginal misfit secondary decay . However , secondary caries main failure mention study , responsible 21 % suddenly crown replacement . The etiology secondary caries classify primary caries , involvement cariogenic microorganism . The place spread invade primary secondary lesion also similar , secondary caries develop mainly gingival tooth interface restore teeth . Different author mention different instrumentation prepare teeth appropriately.Preparation may apply use diamond bur attach sonic device high-speed rotate instrument diamond tungsten carbide bur . The action conventional high-speed instrument apply tooth preparation widely research well adhesion strength marginal microleakage produce . Some author insist dental surface morphology prepare teeth influence type bur use preparation .</detailed_description>
