	<brief_summary>The main objective pilot study make first assessment discriminate ability dosage S100B protein differential diagnosis primary headache secondary headache . For , investigator compare serum S100B protein two group headache patient present emergency department : 1 group primary headache patient 1 group secondary headache patient . If difference two group prove potentially discriminating , investigator seek determine discriminate ability S100B protein calculate area ROC curve . The reference diagnostic set one month across entire clinical picture image expert committee compose neurologist , radiologist emergency physician .</brief_summary>
