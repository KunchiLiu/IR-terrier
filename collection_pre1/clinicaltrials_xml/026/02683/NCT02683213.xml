	<brief_title>Efficacy Fluoxetine - Trial Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke serious , life-threatening medical condition happen blood supply part brain cut , usually due blood clot ( ischemic ) hemorrhage . Symptoms vary accord much brain affect brain stroke occur include paralysis , muscle weakness speech problem . A stroke also impact sufferer emotion lead anxiety , depression personality change . Fluoxetine ( otherwise know Prozac ) use many year treat depression . However , evidence suggest may also effect brain enhance brain plasticity ( reorganisation neural pathway brain ) number different way . One small study , example , show , take soon stroke , fluoxetine might improve recovery arm strength lead great restoration movement limb . Adult participant ( least 18 year old ) stroke ( either ischemic hemorrhagic ) within last 2-15 day still residual problem cause stroke e.g . weakness , problem speech ( speech impairment ) . Participants randomly allocate one two group . Those group 1 give fluoxetine capsule 6 month . Those group 2 give placebo capsule 6 month . The participant contact one week start treatment , one month , check well-being still take allocate caplets . Each participant ask side effect much training e.g . physiotherapist , occupational- speech-therapist . The research team contact participant 3 month check whether still take capsule , ask bad side effect , feeling ( mood ) . If well , participant give enough medication cover rest study period . The participant ask stop study medication 6 month repeat assessment start study local hospital . They also ask fill questionnaires together next kin carer . These questionnaire send trial main centre . If need , also fill help trial nurse telephone . The participant contact one month stop medication see progress . At 12 month recruitment , participant ask complete questionnaire well recover stroke problem stroke e.g . weakness limb , memory problem , problem speech , low mood .

	<criteria>Informed consent obtain patient accord trial investigator mentally capable decisionmaking , receive information get answer question , want participate trial . Brain image compatible intra cerebral hemorrhage ischemic stroke . Randomization perform 2 15 day stroke onset research group patient 's local/emergency hospital . Persisting focal neurological deficit present time randomization severe enough warrant treatment physicians patient 's relative 's perspective . Subarachnoidal hemorrhage except secondary primary intracerebral hemorrhage . Unlikely available follow next 12 month e.g . fix home address . Unable speak Swedish close family member available help follow form . Other life threaten illness ( e.g . advanced cancer ) make 12month survival unlikely . History epileptic seizure . History allergy contraindication fluoxetine include : Hepatic impairment ( SASAT/ALAT &gt; 3 upper normal limit ) renal impairment ( SCreatinine level &gt; 180 micromol/L ) . Pregnant breastfeeding , woman childbearing age take contraception . Minimum contraception oral contraceptive . An HCGtest make prior randomization end trial medication . Previous drug overdose attempt suicide . Already enrolled CTIMP . Current recent ( within last month ) depression require treatment SSRI antidepressant . Current use medication serious interaction fluoxetine Use monoaminooxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) last 5 week . Coadministration Fluoxetine monoaminooxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) may result life threaten interaction . Therefore , patient MAOI ineligible EFFECTS trial . Also , patient need treatment MAOI must stop trial treatment least 5 week commence MAOI , treat inpatient psychiatrist .</criteria>
