	<brief_title>Effectiveness And Safety Of Two Protocols For The Treatment Of Erectile Dysfunction With Low-Density Shock Waves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives General Determine comparative effectiveness safety two treatment protocol use low-intensity shock wave treat patient erectile dysfunction see Boston Medical Group 's Bogota center . Specific 1 . Determine difference IIEF-5 EHS score result Li-ESWT therapy patient ED , upon completion therapy 1 , 3 6 month thereafter , accord type protocol use . 2 . Determine difference penile blood flow result Li-ESWT therapy patient ED , measure doppler upon completion therapy 3 month thereafter , accord type protocol use . 3 . Determine difference adverse effect Li-ESWT therapy patient ED , accord type protocol use . Type Study Randomized , experimental , non-inferiority clinical trial determine comparative effectiveness safety two protocol use treatment ED Li-ESWT , patient see Boston Medical Group 's Bogota center . Investigation Hypothesis Ho : Differences exist effectiveness two treatment protocol use Li-ESWT treat erectile dysfunction , measure improvement EHS score one month complete treatment . Ha : No difference exist effectiveness two treatment protocol use Li-ESWT treat erectile dysfunction , measure improvement EHS score one month complete treatment . Population Patients diagnose ED treat Boston Medical Group 's Bogota center . These patient must meet eligibility criterion . Sample Size The sample size calculate non-inferiority , base new approach least good exist one . The effectiveness Protocol 1 presume 57 % , accord literature ( 12 ) , Protocol 2 presume least good Protocol 1 . The difference effectiveness two protocol less equal 20 % . With power 80 % significance level 97.5 % , one-tailed test require sample size 97 individual per arm . Since maximum 5 % patient expect lose first month post-treatment , final sample size 103 individual per arm calculate , therefore , total 206 individual randomly assign . These calculation perform use Stata 14Â© ssi module . Interventions Each patient randomly assign one two arm . The patient arm treat one two protocol describe . These protocol administer two Li-ESWT machine either Storz Duollith , Medispec MTS . The protocol : - Protocol 1 : Consists five session , one per week , 3000 pulse 0,15 mg/mm2 , frequency 4 Hz . The distribution shock 2000 pulse body penis 1000 pulse base . Total duration : 5 week . - Protocol 2 : Consists six session , two per week , 1500 pulse one 0.1 mJ/mm2 , frequency 4 Hz . The distribution shock 900 pulse body penis 600 pulse base . Total duration : 3 week . Outcome Variables Effectiveness The principal outcome variable effectiveness intervention measure : - Erection Hardness Score ( EHS ) . The EHS single Likert scale , validate Spanish version use ( 27 ) . The score follow : 0 = Penis increase size ; 1= penis increase size hard ; 2 = penis hard hard enough penetration ; 3 = penis hard enough penetration completely hard ; 4 = penis completely hard fully rigid ( Appendix 1 ) . - International Index Erectile Function , 5-item version ( IIEF-5 ) . Five question relate erectile function , orgasmic function , sexual desire , satisfaction sexual relation overall satisfaction . In addition , high sensitivity specificity detect change erectile function response treatment . The ED grade score scale 0 25 point , : 5-7 severe , 8-11 moderate , 12-16 mild moderate ; 17-21 average ; 22-25 ED exist ( 28 ) ( Appendix 2 ) . - Penile blood flow vasoactive stimulus prostaglandin ( VSP ) , measure color echo-doppler . After apply standard dosage VSP , exam measure blood flow cavernous dorsal artery base penis . This measurement perform periodically every 5 minute , application medication obtain best possible flow . This determine normal flow 35 cm/sec , undetermined 25 35 cm/sec abnormal flow 25 cm/sec . The score EHS IIEF-5 scale measure baseline , upon completion protocol , 1 , 3 6 month complete protocol . Doppler measurement penile artery take baseline 1 month complete protocol . Safety This determine accord presence adverse event , analyze upon completion therapy 1 , 3 6 month ( control month ) . This variable dichotomous , presence absence adverse event . It important emphasize adverse event report to-date clinical trial patient ED treat Li-ESWT ( 12 , 14 , 19 , 29 ) . Techniques , Procedures Data Collection Processing Subjects see private consultation Boston Medical Group 's Bogota center screen define whether meet eligibility criterion . If eligible invited participate investigation give informed consent form explain objective investigation well risk involve participate study . The patient assign one two arm process select ballot among group ballot mark protocol store dark bag . Prior begin two protocol , baseline measurement take outcomes related study 's objective ( EHS , IIEF-5 doppler measurement blood flow cavernous artery ) . In accordance result randomization process , subject treat one protocol mention correspond section . Upon completion administration protocol , EHS IIEF-5 score measure second time , well associate adverse effect . This do five week begin treatment subject Protocol 1 three week begin treatment subject Protocol 2 . Medical check-ups perform doctor experience treatment male sexual dysfunction . These conduct 1 , 3 6 month complete Li-ESWT protocol . EHS IIEF-5 score determine consultation , well presence absence adverse event related therapy . A second measurement penile blood flow take doppler echography one month completing protocol . All information record electronic clinical history already exist Boston Medical Group . The clinical information extract electronic clinical history data sample collect . This information export flat file read later statistical package . In term historical information , 4 5 individual expect include study per week . Based supposition , approximately 52 week need inclusion individual . The last individual include followed sixth month completion therapy . Follow-up Loss-to-Follow-up One person involve project medical supervisor responsible conduct telephone follow-up patient include study . This do expectation guarantee loss-to-follow-up 5 % first month post-therapy .</detailed_description>
