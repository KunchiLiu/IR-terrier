	<brief_title>Measurement Energy Metabolism Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study intend establish feasibility undertake comprehensive metabolic phenotyping infant . The overarch aim complete prospective assessment energy expenditure new infant metabolic chamber approximately one week apart determine accuracy precision infant protocol related energy metabolism ( sleep metabolic rate , rest metabolic rate , diet-induced thermogenesis ) , physical activity , suck behavior . This cross-sectional study answer follow question : 1 . What test re-test reliability measure energy expenditure ( sleep metabolic rate , rest metabolic rate , diet-induced thermogenesis ) infant condition , 5-7 day apart ? 2 . What reliability 24h energy expenditure estimate infant metabolic chamber comparison 7-day doubly label water study ? 3 . How energy expenditure measurement infant need adjust account variability infant size body composition ?</detailed_description>
