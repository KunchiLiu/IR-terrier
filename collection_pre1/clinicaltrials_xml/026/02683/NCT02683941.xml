	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 , prospective , multi-center , randomize , double-blind , study evaluate efficacy safety LAN plus BSC versus placebo plus BSC treatment well-differentiated , metastatic and/or unresectable , typical atypical lung NETs This study contain two phase : Double-Blind ( DB ) Phase , Open Label ( OL ) Extension Phase . The DB Phase include : Screening , Baseline Treatment period . The OL Extension Phase consist two period : Treatment Period Follow-Up Period . The primary objective compare antitumour efficacy Lanreotide Autogel/Depot 120 mg ( LAN ) plus Best Supportive Care ( BSC ) every 28 day versus placebo plus BSC , term progression free survival ( PFS ) , measured central review use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ) v1.1 criterion , every 12 week , subject unresectable and/or metastatic well differentiate , typical atypical lung neuroendocrine tumour</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The DB Phase include Screening Visit establish protocol eligibility disease characteristic . The Baseline Visit confirm eligibility prior randomization treatment . The DB Phase study end date data cut-off primary analysis PFS , occur target number event ( 175 disease Progression centrally assess death reach ) two treatment group observe . All subject still study treatment time enter OL Extension Phase ( either Treatment Period Follow-Up Period ) . In OL Extension Treatment Period , subject allow receive active treatment randomize placebo arm . During OL Follow-up Period , subject continue follow QoL survival subsequent anticancer treatment receive record . Both OL Extension Treatment Period Follow-up Phases end 6 month date data cut-off ( 175 event - progression assess centrally death - reach ) .</detailed_description>
