	<brief_summary>Invasive mould infections emerge cause morbidity mortality ICU patient . This attribute prolonged ICU stay critically ill patient many co-morbidities . Modern medicine multiple intervention make patient susceptible prevalent mould environment . In India high frequency IMIs general attribute environmental host factor prevalent region . Additionally sub-optimal hospital care practice , frequent demolition construction activity hospital make patient susceptible IMIs . There multicentric study available India describe epidemiology IMIs India . However , single center study report distinct epidemiology IMIs India . High incidence , different spectrum risk factor possible unique feature IMIs India.Early diagnosis optimal therapy improve outcome patient . The conventional diagnosis include histopathology culture limitation . The test low sensitivity long turnaround time . The major challenge collection sample deep tissue . Therefore majority patient ICUs India manage empirically invasive fungal disease . The galactomannan test improve diagnosis invasive aspergillosis . However , galactomannan test well standardized non-neutropenic patient . Beta-glucan test use early diagnosis invasive fungal infection mucormycosis . But test cumbersome routine laboratory expensive . Both test available majority Institutions India . PCR assay standardize perform routinely Institution . Due limitation diagnosis , uniform management protocol ICUs India . To develop optimal management protocol , need know epidemiology , right patient treat , antifungal drug resistance , optimal drug duration therapy etc . The present study provide descriptive epidemiology , present status diagnosis management practice India treat IMIs ICUs . This help find suitable intervention strategy improve outcome IMIs India.This descriptive observational prospective study document epidemiologic clinical characteristic , well treatment outcome data , patient IMIs ICUs India one year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prospective study describe epidemiology IMIs ICUs India . The study describe incidence , risk factor , fungi cause IMIs susceptibility antifungal agent , well current strategy adopt ICU physician management IMIs . It also describe outcome IMIs . The study help planning future management strategy specific IMIs ICUs India . Methods Study description : Prospective , multicenter study iCUs India . Purpose : Determination epidemiologic parameter , include risk factor , description current management outcome patient IMI record prospectively . The study help understand epidemiology IMI ICUs possible planning future management strategy IMI specific India . Risk : There risk patient study observational study intervention intend . Site selection : 15 ICU 's identify across country ICU physicians well versed invasive fungal infection competent diagnostic mycology laboratory available A site feasibility survey conduct . This ensure participate site fulfill follow inclusion criterion : ) maintain ICD cod total number discharge deaths center ; b ) manage critically ill patient ICU ; c ) access high-resolution CT ( HRCT ) scan ; ) mycology laboratory performs isolation identification fungi least perform galactomannan test ; e ) histopathology facility . Study Period : April 1 , 2016 June 30 , 2017 . Case enrolment - April 1 , 2016 March 31 , 2017 . Analysis data - April 1 , 2017 June 30 , 2017 No . patient : All consecutive patient proven probable IMI ICUs study center study period include . Patient selection All consecutive patient diagnose proven probable IMIs ICUs study site include . Inclusion criterion : Proven : Histopathology/cytology/culture/direct microscopy demonstrate septate hypha invade tissue aspirate sterile sit Probable : - Host satisfies host criterion EORTC - Host COPD satisfy definition Bulpa P , et al Eur Resp J 2007 - Host ICU satisfy clinical algorithm Blot SI , et al Am J Resp Crit Care Med 2012 Exclusion criterion : - Endemic mycoses ( histoplasmosis , sporotrichosis , penicilliosis ) - Yeast infection - Allergic fungal disease like allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis - Infection limit skin Conduct study Investigators study : Arunaloke Chakrabarti coordinator study . Each site Principal Investigator - site PI . Other investigator site co-investigators . Patient enrollment : The site PI ( one co-investigators ) review patient 's paper electronic record determine patient satisfies inclusion criterion . Patients fulfill inclusion criterion include case . Data collection : The demographic , clinical , treatment outcome data collect investigator email form study coordinator , Arunaloke Chakrabarti . Outcome measure day discharge/death/30 120 day ( whichever earlier ) diagnosis IMI . The date diagnosis IMI day diagnosis define proven probable . For case enrol probable subsequently become proven , date diagnosis earlier date . In addition , center also obtain data relevant hospital authority total number discharge deaths ICUs period April 1 , 2016 March 31 , 2017 . Fungal isolates : All isolates prove probable IMIs send Mycology Reference Laboratory PGIMER , Chandigarh final identification antifungal susceptibility test Patient management : The study interfere patient management . Statistics The study analyze use descriptive statistic . It anticipate study provide follow information : - Incidence IMI among patient ICUs study period participate center - Relative frequency risk factor among IMI patient participate center . - Three-month survival patient diagnose IMI . - Other data study able generate accordance objective . - Kaplan-Meier plot use describe survival patient IMI accord underlying diagnosis .</detailed_description>
