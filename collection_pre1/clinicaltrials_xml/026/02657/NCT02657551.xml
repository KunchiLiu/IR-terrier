	<detailed_description>This phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve regorafenib treatment metastatic colorectal cancer locally advance , unresectable metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor . Regorafenib approve treatment thyroid cancer . Regorafenib oral anti-tumor agent block activity specific kind protein involve normal cellular function pathologic process tumor formation maintenance .</detailed_description>
