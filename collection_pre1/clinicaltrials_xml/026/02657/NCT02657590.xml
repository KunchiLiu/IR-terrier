	<brief_title>Documentation Cardiac Arrhythmias After Open Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30-50 % patient cardiac surgery develop cardiac arrhythmia , often atrial , frequently atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . Various risk factor , inter alia , type surgery risk factor . The major additional risk factor postoperative atrial fibrillation : age , valvular involvement , length cardiopulmonary bypass cross-clamp time . Postoperative atrial fibrillation associate increase length stay , high morbidity mortality include stroke . Documentation postopertive atrial fibrillation well gather postopertive length stay , scarce information exist regard development occurence atrial arrhythmias patient 's discharge . Additionally , various management protocol exist regard postoperative atrial fibrillation , rely continuous treatment patient amiodarone various anti-arrhythmic agent initial postoperative period , initial first month discharge . So far unambiguous recommendation regard duration treatment require amiodarone release patient . The aim study document record cardiac arrhythmia patient open-heart surgery within time window since release hospital six week surgery . Results study allow u fully characterize postoperative arrhythmia risk factor .</detailed_description>
