	<brief_summary>This single center , randomize , blind trial healthy volunteer . The volunteer receive bilateral placement new catheter correspond adductor canal . Each volunteer catheter place adductor canal leg . The catheter randomize place either long-axis short-axis plane adductor canal . Both catheter inject local analgesic ( LA ) . Allocation blind volunteer investigator assess sensory function . The volunteer send home catheter situ return follow day . Injection LA repeat sensory function test . Furthermore catheter position determine ultrasound injection . If sensory function affect injection LA catheter visualize ultrasound reposition followed second injection LA subsequent assessment sensory function</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3.2.1 Allocation concealment The volunteer randomize use seal opaque envelope 1:1 ratio . The randomization define leg use insertion catheter long-axis plane leg use insertion short-axis plane adductor canal . The envelope prepare health personnel relation study base computer-generated list . 3.2.2 Blinding Volunteers blind allocation . An opaque sterile drape use insertion prevent volunteer observe catheter insertion . After insertion catheter cover bandage prevent unblinding volunteer . The investigator responsible insertion catheter leave room insertion separate assessor blind allocation perform outcome assessment . On day 2 investigator responsible primary insertion ass catheter position ultra-sound ( US ) , record video assessor , injection local anesthetic cover catheter bandage . A separate blind assessor perform outcome assessment 3.2.3 Execution During catheter placement volunteer monitor use pulse oximetry secure intravenous access obtain . A baseline sensory assessment perform cold sensation medial side low leg test use alcohol swab . A peripheral nerve catheter insert side US guidance . This involve skin puncture site insertion exit site . To facilitate insertion skin locally infiltrate lidocaine . Intravenous analgesia provide necessary ( alfentanil 0.5mg/ml ) . One catheter insert short-axis plane adductor canal use plane technique . The second catheter insert long-axis plane use dynamic combination plane plane technique . 10ml normal saline use hydro dissection catheter . When catheter place 15 mL LA ( lidocaine 10mg/ml ) inject catheter . Distance catheter orifice artery note short axis group distance catheter orifice fascia penetration note long axis group . After injection , catheter fixate skin dressing . Successful primary placement catheter test 30 minute injection blind investigator use bilateral assessment sensory function describe previously . Furthermore , cutaneous mapping perform assess affect cutaneous area . Subsequently volunteer send home catheter situ return follow day . The volunteer instruct exercise -i.e . running , cycling , weight training etc . On day 2 catheter position assess US injection LA distance catheter orifice artery/fascia determine . A sensory assessment perform . If loss cold sensation catheter register displace therefore manually reposition inject LA use US guidance . Assessment cold sensation repeat . Further , two investigator independently watch video clip injection procedure ass whether position within adductor canal . Total duration participation individual volunteer 2 day .</detailed_description>
