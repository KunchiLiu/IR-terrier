	<brief_summary>This study conduct collect analyze biospecimens ( blood urine ) clinical data patient prostate cancer well healthy volunteer well understand difference cancer cell normal tissue goal develop good way detect track treatment prostate cancer . - These sample collect conduct research accomplish goal improve cancer therapy , biomarkers , hopefully lead effective treatment prostate cancer . - The sample provide patient prostate cancer use future research . - Your biospecimens compare cancer normal volunteer specimens participant understand genetic difference normal cancer cell . Genetic material , include DNA RNA , obtain sample , store , use evaluation . - Clinical information sample collect store ongoing research . This necessity improve diagnosis , prognosis treatment cancer future depend upon ongoing analysis basic research finding clinical outcome . This type research may improve life future patient cancer . Men age 18 100 diagnosis cancer undergo standard therapy radiation may join .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The American Cancer Society estimate approximately 29,480 men die prostate cancer United States 2014 . Many men initially diagnose aggressive prostate cancer ( so-called `` high risk '' prostate cancer ) , often cancer extend beyond prostate gland high Gleason score , associate Prostate Specific Antigen [ PSA ] level &gt; 20 ng/ml . In contrast favorable outcome men low intermediate risk disease , nearly 50 % men high-risk prostate cancer recurrence cancer despite complete course treatment . One mainstays care men high-risk prostate cancer combination radiation therapy hormone suppression ( appropriately call androgen deprivation [ ADT ] ) . Despite advance , clear need exists improve clinical management high risk disease . One challenge overall management men high risk prostate cancer lack reliable test allow clinician monitor tumor response radiation therapy . The commonly use marker , prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) , less useful men receive ADT . In men , PSA level strongly suppress ADT less reliable surrogate detect active tumor . Importantly , ADT give 3 year follow radiation therapy , limit utility PSA test extended period time window curative therapy may close . The development accurate , noninvasive monitoring test need , guide early implementation salvage strategy aim increase proportion patient cure disease . Prior research group several others demonstrate prostate cancer nearly universally harbor stable , cancer-specific change ( modification ) DNA . Furthermore , publish study show modified ( methylated ) DNA readily detect urine blood specimen men primary prostate cancer . Investigators hypothesize large scale assessment cancer-specific DNA change rearrangement urine plasma prostate cancer patient use technology develop group ( qMBD-seq ) , allow informative accurate track disease burden therapeutic response men receive radiation therapy ADT high-risk prostate cancer . Investigators two straightforward primary objective pilot study . First establish background level modify DNA individual history prostate cancer . Second , investigator quantify cancer-specific methylated DNA men know high risk prostate cancer . Investigators begin collect urine plasma specimen normal volunteer . In parallel investigator collect specimens quantitation cancer-specific DNA modification men know high-risk prostate cancer receive standard treatment Department Radiation Oncology . Patient sample collect multiple time point , , radiation treatment subject careful DNA sequencing analysis . This allow investigator simultaneously characterize quantify prostate cancer specific DNA occur anywhere genome , thereby allow investigator predict patient prostate cancer still present body treatment even PSA low undetectable . If successful , project important first step development noninvasive test track disease burden therapeutic response radiation therapy high-risk prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
