	<detailed_description>This study integrate cognitive rehabilitation residential care homeless Veterans . In 15-week randomized control trial , investigator compare evidence-based , 10-week Compensatory Cognitive Training ( CCT ) intervention education control condition homeless Veterans cognitive impairment . CCT aim improve real-world cognitive performance teaching strategy improve prospective memory ( remember thing ) , attention , learning/memory , executive functioning . Strategies reduce stress improve sleep also include . CCT show improve cognition , functional capacity , neurobehavioral symptom severity , quality life individual cognitive impairment associate psychiatric illness Veterans traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . During trial , assessment administer baseline , 5 week , 10 week , 15 week , monthly follow-up phone call assess housing employment/education status one year follow program discharge . The investigator expect CCT-associated improvement cognition functional skill ( co-primary outcome ) generalization reduce level disability , along improve community reintegration outcome ( well housing stability , participation work school , healthcare appointment attendance ) . If effective , CCT intervention could export 80+ residential VA program serve homeless Veterans . The investigator thus propose follow aim : Aim 1 . Investigate efficacy cognitive rehabilitation homeless return Veterans mental health condition cognitive impairment conduct randomize controlled trial Compensatory Cognitive Training ( CCT ) vs. education control 10 week , 5-week follow-up , follow 1 year monthly post-discharge follow-up phone call assess community reintegration outcomes . H1a : Positive CCT-associated effect cognition , functional capacity ( co-primary outcome ) , disability emerge 15-week study . H1b : Positive CCT-associated effect community reintegration outcome ( housing stability , participation employment/education , healthcare appointment attendance ) detect end 1-year follow-up . Aim 2 . Investigate mechanisms CCT effect . H2 : Improved cognition cognitive strategy use mediate improvement functional capacity , disability , community reintegration . Exploratory Aim 3 . Investigate moderator CCT effect . Presence severity Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , depression , history substance abuse , TBI , well duration homelessness baseline cognitive functioning , explore potential moderator CCT effect .</detailed_description>
