As , investigator surprisingly lack clear understanding natural history treatment -related swallow dysfunction ( dysphagia ) regardless treatment modality .

Understanding true prevalence treatment-related dysphagia fact critical establish help guide decision whether treatment strategy require modification include de-intensification treatment receive considerable attention favourable prognosis patient associate human papillomavirus ( HPV ) . To address problem , winvestigators hypothesize quantitative validate patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) instrument , Sydney Swallow Questionnaire ( SSQ ) , effective tool longitudinally measure swallow function determine natural history head neck cancer treatment-related swallow dysphagia . The SSQ particularly well suit longitudinal evaluation swallow function quantifies various aspect patient-perceived swallow function contrast swallow PROs measure impact swallow function quality life domain .

	<detailed_description>Cancers locate upper aerodigestive tract head neck region present unique management challenge due anatomic density region . These include ( cancer ) effective management clinically evident cancer cell sub-clinical cancer cell base knowledge anatomic location ( 2 ) . For head neck cancer , anatomic density region body present significant risk cancer therapy injure important upper aerodigestive function . In particular , swallow function dysfunction ( ie . dysphagia ) multi-faceted consequence head neck cancer patient include serious quality life impairment ( 3 ) potential risk late mortality evidence date suggest aspiration lung injury may major cause ( 1 , 4 ) . In fact , functional consideration profound influence history head neck cancer therapy development . Historically , head neck cancer management manage surgically . Though oncologically effective , transcervical exposure technique along tissue remove cancer extirpation lead increase concern functional impact therapy , especially increase interest preserving function seek investigator patient . As technical improvement fractionate external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) develop early 1980s , investigation evaluate demonstrated various strategy intensify EBRT either concurrent chemotherapy alter radiotherapy fractionation schedule ( ie . twice daily treatment ) improve local-regional tumour control rate provide organ preservation . Studies confirm improve local-regional control rate translate improve survival rate lead acceptance standard-of-care ( SOC ) treatment option . While functional organ preservation often described goal investigation , ability rigorously define fact measure organ function , especially swallow function , often limited successful organ preservation largely reflect ability determine anatomic preservation ( 5 ) . A major reason limit spectrum effective tool measure function ( especially swallow function ) lend repeat systematic longitudinal use throughout course head neck cancer treatment especially follow-up surveillance manifestation go unappreciated . As result , true prevalence treatment-related swallow dysfunction head neck cancer patient remain unknown , observation confirm recent multi-national systematic review ( 6 ) . As noted Institute Medicine , without ability measure , begin improve upon outcome ( 7 ) . Measuring swallow function HNSCC remain particularly challenge effort continue strive towards development function preserve organ cancer therapy . It arguably take great prominence light change epidemiology OPSCC ( 8 , 9 ) increase number OPSCC ( oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer ) patient cancer associated human papillomavirus ( HPV ) favourable prognosis regardless whether surgical non-surgical management approach undertake ( 10 ) . This change epidemiology , describe epidemic proportion ( 9 ) , suggest increase number cancer survivor risk develop late complication especially relate swallow function . While arguably tenet remain firmly establish , highlight several challenge important address . These include establish effective strategy longitudinally measure swallow function also reflect cluster treatment-related symptom affect swallow taste change xerostomia ( 6 ) . It require valid tool one lend repeat ease use ideally within patient 's ecologic environment minimize bias preferably within infrastructure readily curates measure analysis . To address problem , investigator propose longitudinally apply Sydney Swallow Questionnaire ( SSQ ) , validate patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) instrument ( 11 ) evaluate many dimension swallow function , treatment follow-up care head neck cancer patient . The SSQ particularly attractive patient-centric reflect sensation swallow-related symptom ( ie . xerostomia ) important impact sensory change otherwise evaluate swallow metric available . More significantly , SSQ quantitative , multi-dimensional ( encompass swallow-related symptom ) discriminative power swallow metric . Normal population assessment define SSQ score reflect neurogenic non-neurogenic dysphagia include cross-sectional study HNSCC patient . Its longitudinal application however evaluate define natural history prevalence HNSCC-treatment related dysphagia . Lastly , group successfully validate Chinese version SSQ ( relevant inclusion nasopharyngeal cancer patient due increase volume pharynx treat ) develop electronic version original English Chinese version SSQ accessible web-portal Mosaiq/Oncospace® database facilitate secure HIPAA-compliant data curation across institution .</detailed_description>
