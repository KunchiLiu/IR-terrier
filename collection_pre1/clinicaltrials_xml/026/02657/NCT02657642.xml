	<detailed_description>Background : The transitional care OMAGE-P combine three best practice recommendation French National Authority Health ( HAS ) ( ) comprehensive review diagnosis treatment ( ii ) standardize medical report ( iii ) patient education program specifically design old people multiple chronic condition polypharmacy . This transitional care implement pilot general hospital support French ministry Health Regional Agency Health Ile de France .The aim study assess impact OMAGE P transitional care readmission non demented old people age 75 year within 3 month follow discharge home cost-effectiveness Study Population : non demented people age 75 year admit emergency ( ie via emergency department ) participate unit Study design : Observational prospective monocentric non randomize comparative study Exposed patient : eligible patient admit participate unit oppose collection personal data . The hospital physician charge conduct comprehensive review diagnosis treatment standardize medical report . Patient education program conduct hospital physician OMAGE nurse hospitalization ( two sequence ) 2 4 home visit month follow patient 's discharge hospital . Non expose patient : eligible patient usual care arm RCT OMAGE ( Legrain et al , JAGS , 2011 ) . To ensure risk emergency readmission different expose non expose , rate emergency readmission non expose group compare one eligible patient admit participate unit 2013 2014 . Setting : General hospital Eaubonne : geriatric department ( acute geriatric unit , rehabilitation unit , geriatric mobile unit ) internal medicine department The OMAGE-P transitional care : transitional care derive OMAGE intervention , prove associate significant reduction readmitted patient 3 month discharge acute geriatric unit ( , 20.2 % Intervention group participant readmitted emergency basis , compare 28.4 % control group participant , P = .01 , RRR = 28.9 % , 95 % CI = 6.0-51.5 % , Legrain et al JAGS 2011 ) . The OMAGE -P transitional care consist ( ) comprehensive review diagnosis treatment , perform hospital physician . The physician participate unit train medical review use simple tool derive HAS program optimization prescription elderly . This tool consist table confront patient 's health problem treatment . This review necessitate depth treatment history ( performed physician collaboration usual patient 's pharmacist ) , collaboration general practitioner assesment patient 's problem regard drug management ( include adherence , self-medication ..etc ) perform OMAGE nurse . ( ii ) standardize medical report . This report rely HAS recommendation regard medical report include notably table indicate drug admission , drug discharge reason modification . ( iii ) patient education program specifically design old people multiple chronic condition polypharmacy . This program aim promote participant active partner care assess participant ' health priority ( preference , value , treatment burden ) strengthen participant ' ability well manage follow-up . It consist two sequence hospital ( educational assessment OMAGE nurse sequence link patient 's health problem hospital physician ) 2 4 sequence home visit OMAGE nurse red flags situation risk patient 's health , drug management nutrition physical activity adapt patient 's health . The OMAGE nurse performs visit close collaboration GP usual health professional implicate din patient 's care . Statistical analysis : intention treat analysis . Our hypothesis , base result OMAGE RCT , OMAGE P transitional care associate reduction 3-month emergency readmission 30 % 20 % . To detect reduction 80 % power alpha risk 5 % , 242 participant require per arm .</detailed_description>
