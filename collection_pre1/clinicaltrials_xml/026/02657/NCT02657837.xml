	<detailed_description>Functional abnormality associate lung disease cystic fibrosis ( CF ) occur early childhood , historically go undetected onset clinical symptom , point irreversible lung damage may already occur ( 1-3 ) . Consequently , last ten year focus clinical care shift early intervention prevention structural change . To facilitate early intervention press need surrogate marker early obstructive lung disease also sensitive enough detect treatment effect ( 4 ) . The Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) promise marker detect early lung disease . The LCI measure multiple breath washout ( MBW ) indicator ventilation inhomogeneity . MBW perform quiet tidal breathing require minimal effort patient . It feasible age group adaption make young child . While Health Canada license washout system available determine LCI ; device adequately validate ; thus use routine lung function test controversial . As part international effort validate multiple breath washout test measure LCI , specific device license Europe , yet Health Canada approve . Thus , test device consider research . This study utilize technology ass lung function patient undergoing routine lung function test clinical indication . In addition , healthy control different age ask perform lung function test gain reference data use interpret LCI patient lung disease .</detailed_description>
