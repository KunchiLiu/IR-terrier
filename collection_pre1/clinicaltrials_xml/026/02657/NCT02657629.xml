	<brief_title>Comparison Feeding Strategies Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , survival neonatal cardiac surgery improve significantly . As life span improve HLHS/single ventricle variant ( SVV ) survivor , focus shift understanding management associate health problem . Growth failure well-recognized major co-morbidity patient . Infants HLHS/SVV demonstrate progressive growth failure stage 1 procedure , appear stabilize stage 2 procedure . Poor nutritional status increase risk post-operative infection , extend hospital length-of-stay , adversely affect neurodevelopmental outcome . To date , evidence-based feeding strategy support adequate weight gain improve nutritional status identify stage 1 procedure . Continuous enteral feeding regimen result improved growth diverse population infant congenital heart disease show decrease energy expenditure premature infant adult . A randomized , control study HLHS/SVV infant underwent stage 1 procedure single medical center conduct primary objective comparing weight gain hospital discharge infant receive continuous feed regimen versus intermittent feed regimen . Secondary objective compare growth marker nutritional status hospital discharge two group . The investigator hypothesize infant HLHS/SVV receive continuous enteral feed regimen versus intermittent feed regimen demonstrate improve weight gain , growth , nutritional status stage 1 procedure hospital discharge .</detailed_description>
