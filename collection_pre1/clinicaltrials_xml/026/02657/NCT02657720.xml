	<brief_summary>Respiration rate critical vital sign provide early detection respiratory compromise patient distress . Continuous monitor respiration rate perform patient different clinical condition , include post-surgery different respiratory disease . Clinician observation , pulse oximetry , capnography use individually combination monitor ventilation sedation post-surgical patient . The American Society Anesthesiologists mandate monitor respiration measure end tidal carbon dioxide ( RRetco2 ) procedural sedation anesthesia . Other technique respiration rate measurement include different technology acoustic respiratory rate ( RRa ) . The aim study compare accuracy RRetco2 RRa certain respiratory condition .</brief_summary>
