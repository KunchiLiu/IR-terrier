	<detailed_description>This investigator initiate , single-center , open-label , crossover , randomize , interventional , in-hospital pediatric study , perform University Children 's Hospital , University Medical Center Ljubljana . Study duration 4 week per subject , 6 month overall . The study compare Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM ) base time hypoglycemia intervention arm ( Glucose control use DreaMed MD-AID ) control arm ( Glucose control use SAP ) . Each arm include two exercise day 1 week in-between . Subjects randomly assign participate first intervention arm ( 10 subject ) first control arm ( 10 subject ) . At end first period patient ask participate another , i.e . arm least one week arm . Subjects instruct consume similar diet avoid caffeine , alcohol , physical activity 48 hour exercise day visit . The start run-in period schedule separate visit , 2 day screen . All subject attend clinic six occasion : - Visit 1 : Screening sensor/pump education , detailed physical examination perform , subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . - Visit 2 : Baseline assessment DreaMed MD-AID profile , subject perform rest electrocardiography ( ECG ) determination maximal oxygen consumption rate ( VO2max ) cycle ergometer Ganshorn LF8.5G™ Schiller software , BG measurement , end exercise 2 hour exercise . Subjects instruct refrain physical activity 48 hour prior visit 3 - 6 . - Visit 3 : 24 hour DreaMed MD-AID SAP afternoon exercise ( time 16:30 19:30 ) : i.v . catheter insert antecubital cephalic vein ( plasma BG emergency ) . Cycle ergometer adjust subject ( work rate , seat height , .. ) , instruct pedal steady rate 50-60 rotation per minute ( RPM ) .The subject cycle 40 minute 55 % Vo2max load ( start work rate set 30 watt ( W ) linear load reach 55 % VO2max 5:00 minute exercise time ) - aim session induce delay hypoglycemia . - Visit 4 : 24 hour DreaMed MD-AID SAP afternoon exercise ( time 16:30 19:30 ) : i.v . catheter insert antecubital cephalic vein ( plasma BG emergency ) . Cycle ergometer adjust subject ( work rate , seat height , .. ) , instruct pedal steady rate 50-60 rotation per minute ( RPM ) . The subject cycle 40minutes - high intensity interval training ( 2 - 6 sprint 20 second 80 % VO2max interval 6 minute low-moderate activity ( 55 % VO2max ( total ~40 minute ) sprint . The aim session imitate child 's physical activity ( burst intensive physical activity intersperse vary interval activity low moderate intensity . - Visit 5 &amp; 6 : Same visit 3 4 , cross DreaMed MD-AID SAP vice versa . During exercise , continuous ECG record inhaled O2 exhale Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) measure . BG lactate take exercise visit : beginning exercise , every 15 min exercise session , every half hour next 2 hour thereafter . All hypoglycemia confirm SBGM : glucose value &lt; 3.3 ( 60 mg/dl ) mmol/l symptomatic , hypoglycemia self blood glucose monitoring ( SBGM ) value &lt; 2.8 mmol/l ( 50 mg/dl ) ( regardless symptom ) treat rescue carbohydrate per standard in-hospital procedure ( 15 g sugar per 10 kg body weight ( BW ) , re-evaluate repeat necessary 15-30 minute ) . New infusion set two continuous glucose sensor ( one back-up ) insert subcutaneous tissue arm calibrate day visit 3 6 . Schedule exercise day similar : - 12:00 hospital admission - 13:00 lunch - 13:30 16:00 rest - 16:00 afternoon snack - 16:30 19:30 exercise protocol - 19:45 dinner - 21:00 7:30 next day : bed time - 8:00 breakfast . - 13:00 lunch end study Subjects standardize similar meal exercise day ( lunch 13:00 , afternoon snack 16:00 , dinner 19:45 , breakfast 8:00 next day ) , base weight , calculate carbohydrate calorie : 1 gram carbohydrate per kilogram , content meal accord recommendation : comprise 50 % carbohydrate , 20 % protein , 30 % fat , 10 % saturate fat . During exercise SAP group turn insulin pump low basal insulin 20 % next 4 hour exercise .</detailed_description>

Diagnosed T1D , define American Diabetes Association World Health Organization ( ADA/WHO ) least 1 year prior study enrolment . Documented evidence exist within patient history T1D . Age 10 17 year ( inclusive ) time enrolment . Treatment insulin pump therapy least 3 month . HbA1C value ≤ 9 % base analysis local laboratory time enrolment ( A1C test must follow National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program ( NGSP ) standard ) . Willing follow study instruction ( child parent evaluate one ) Availability entire study duration followup visit Willing perform daily selfmonitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) require sensor calibration If also present celiac/Hashimoto disease , disease adequately treat determined investigator BMI 5th centile 95th centile age , respectively . Concomitant disease influence metabolic control ( e.g . anemia , significantly impair hepatic function , renal failure , history adrenal insufficiency ) medical condition , investigator 's opinion , may compromise patient safety ; Note : Adequately treat thyroid disease celiac disease exclude subject enrollment . Significant comorbidity , opinion investigator would preclude participation study ( e.g . current treatment cancer , mental disorder ) Any concomitant oral parenteral glucocorticoid therapy within 1 month prior screen , plan take oral parenteral glucocorticoid study . ( Exceptions : Short term oral glucocorticoid 7 day , inhaled steroid ) . Any concomitant therapy antidiabetic agent medication , could contraindication participation study judgment investigator .
