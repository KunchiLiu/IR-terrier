A rescreening occur 2 month exit study failure comply one eligibility criterion list . Volunteers follow criterion consider non eligible study ( assessment base medical examination perform V0 check V1 ) : Suffering metabolic disorder diabetes , uncontrolled thyroidal trouble metabolic disorder .

With know suspect food allergy intolerance hypersensitivity study product ' ingredient . Pregnant lactate woman intend become pregnant within 4 month ahead . Requiring cholesterol lower immediate pharmacologic intervention accord current recommendation ( AFSSAPS 2005 ) . Under lipidlowering treatment ( e.g . statin , fibrates , ezetimibe , bile acid sequestrants , niacin , etc . ) stop less 4 month randomization . Under medication could affect blood lipid parameter ( e.g . longterm corticosteroid systemic drug , systemic antibody , androgen phenytoin , etc . ) stop less 1 month randomization ( stable longterm treatment beta blocker thiazide diuretic tolerate ) . Regular intake dietary supplement `` health food '' know decrease LDLc triglyceride ( e.g . rich plant stanol sterol like PROACTIV DANACOL product , red yeast rice , policosanol , capsule contain omega3 fatty acid fish oil , etc . ) stop less 3 month randomization . Under treatment dietary supplement could significantly affect parameter ( ) follow study accord investigator stop short period randomization .
