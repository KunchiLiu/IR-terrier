	<brief_title>Development Evidenced-Based Tool Prediction Sudden Death Patients With Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy ( NICM ) comprise almost one half congestive heart failure ( CHF ) population NICM portend increase risk hospitalization due CHF well death . This population also high risk occurrence tachyarrhythmias high incidence sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) . The risk SCD lower placement ( intercardioverter defibrillator ) ICD . The implantation ICD significantly reduce risk SCD patient NICM leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) 35 percent less . However implantation ICD short term well long term risk associate . Many patient receive ICD never go appropriate therapy . Current American College Cardiology/American Heart Association ( ACC/AHA ) guideline state `` ICD therapy recommend primary prevention SCD reduce total mortality select patient nonischemic dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) ischemic heart disease least 40 day post-myocardial infarction ( MI ) LVEF 35 % less New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class II III symptom chronic guideline-directed medical therapy ( GDMT ) , reasonable expectation meaningful survival 1 year . '' There need new criterion ICD placement patient NICM sensitive specific current guideline . Delayed enhancement image cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) become gold standard myocardial scar/necrosis detection . The presence late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE ) CMR correspond myocardial scar fibrosis show predictor adverse outcome ischemic cardiomyopathy . There study evaluate significance LGE patient NICM , however result promise . The presence LGE associate incidence inducible tachycardia electrophysiology ( EP ) test patient NICM . LGE also associate increase risk morbidity mortality general NICM population . The investigator plan enroll patient NICM EF ≤ 40 % refer CMR follow composite endpoint sudden cardiac death appropriate ICD therapy ( Antitachycardic pace shock ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Newly diagnose NICM define patient whose initial sign symptom cardiomyopathy predate time enrollment study six month . 2 . LVEF ≤ 40 % . ( Based transthoracic echocardiography [ Simpson´s Rule ] ) 3 . NYHA functional class IIV 4 . Patients age 18 85 , gender race ethnicity . 5 . Patients diagnose peripartum cardiomyopathy ( PPCM ) may include long enrol within six month initiation cardiac symptom . 6 . Patients must competent give inform consent . 1 . Significant coronary artery disease &gt; 75 % luminal stenosis least 1 epicardial vessel , history myocardial infarction1 coronary revascularization . 2 . Congenital heart disease . 3 . Infiltrative cardiomyopathy ( amyloid , sarcoidosis , glycogen storage disease hemochromatosis ) . 4 . Patients whose heart failure felt secondary primary valvular disease ( ≥ moderate/severe mitral regurgitation ) , uncorrected thyroid disease , uncontrolled hypertension despite medical therapy , obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , pericardial disease systemic illness . 5 . Absolute contraindication undergo CMR ( Renal failure glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30 % ICD/PPM ) . 6 . Unwilling unable provide inform consent . 7 . Patients life threaten disease malignancy would likely decrease life expectancy next three year . Any history malignancy treat either chest radiation chemotherapy . 8 . Past present history alcoholism , whose current alcohol consumption exceed average three drink per day . A past history cocaine IV drug abuse possible explanation cardiomyopathy well substance abuse prescription pain reliever illicit drug may hinder participant 's ability complete study followup . 9 . Patients post cardiac transplant . 10 . Pregnancy . 11 . Subjects asymptomatic , diagnose cardiomyopathy unknown duration screen know familial disease exclude 12 . Patients enrolled trial treatment arm ( Patients enrol diagnostic trial include ) . 13 . Difficulty attend followup schedule due history medical noncompliance , live distance study center , anticipated nonresidence area length time require followup . 14 . Patients antiarrhythmic immunosuppressant drug . 15 . Tachyarrhythmia/Premature Ventricular Contraction ( PVC ) induce cardiomyopathy normalizes within 3 month begin treatment tachyarrhythmia/PVCs . 16 . The following patient exclude medical reason : Patients evidence chronic liver disease ( total bilirubin &gt; 3.0mg % ) chronic renal disease ( creatinine &gt; equal 2.5mg % ) exclude study . Subjects present acute worsen renal function liver function test set worsen heart failure enrol GFR &gt; 30 % time CMR . 17 . Evidence ongoing bacteremia sepsis . Patient febrile illness felt secondary myocarditis ( even nondiagnostic biopsy ) . 18 . Patients myocardial biopsy reveals evidence myocarditis define Dallas criterion cardiac MRI evidence myocarditis Louise criterion exclude .</criteria>
