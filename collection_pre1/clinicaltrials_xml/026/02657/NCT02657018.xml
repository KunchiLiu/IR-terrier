	<brief_title>Mobile Exergaming Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) grow emerge pandemic key determinant morbidity mortality develop develop country worldwide . The successful treatment prevention T2DM one big future health care challenge important manage enormous socio-economic burden associate T2DM various comorbidities . Physical inactivity know one important risk factor development obesity T2DM . In contrast , increase physical activity ( PA ) fitness lower T2DM incidence , improve patient 's glucose metabolism reduce morbidity ( premature ) mortality , independent body mass index ( BMI ) risk factor . Despite obvious benefit regular PA treatment prevention T2DM , activity-promoting program target T2DM patient seldom successful long term due diminish patient motivation . A novel approach motivate individual least likely engage regular PA physically active adhere regular PA active video game `` exergames '' combine PA video gaming . However , exist exergames offer fitness-level adjusted , individualized workout normally stationary bound TV , thus enable PA anywhere time . To address shortcoming , investigator use sport scientific expertise develop smartphone-based , mobile garden simulation game application , specifically design middle-aged T2DM patient , induce healthy , active lifestyle part successful T2DM treatment management .</detailed_description>
