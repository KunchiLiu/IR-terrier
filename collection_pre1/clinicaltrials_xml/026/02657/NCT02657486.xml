	<criteria>Recurrent highrisk nonmuscleinvasive bladder cancer prior intravesical BCG therapy meeting follow criterion : Histologically document diagnosis urothelial carcinoma confirm Department Pathology MSKCC . Documentation activate FGFR3 mutation gene fusion assay perform CLIAcertified laboratory . History highgrade , stage pTa nonmuscleinvasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) . Clinical evidence highgrade , stage pTa NMIBC . Prior intravesical therapy least one induction course BCG Multiple papillary lesion least one amenable marker tumor study ( ≤1 cm , noninvasive ) OR solitary papillary lesion amenable marker tumor study ( ≤1 cm , noninvasive ) Patient must willing consent MSKCC protocol 12245 ( `` Tumor Genomic Profiling Patients Evaluated Targeted Cancer Therapy '' Age 18 year old . Patient must willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test . Patient must able swallow retain oral medication . Karnofsky performance status ≥80 . Recovery adverse event previous systemic anticancer therapy baseline grade 1 , except : Alopecia Stable neuropathy ≤ grade 2 due prior cancer therapy Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must agree use highly effective method contraception dose 3 month follow discontinuation study treatment . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle subject ) . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm followup hormone level assessment . Male sterilization ( least 6 month prior screen ) . For female subject vasectomize male partner sole partner . Combination two follow ( a+b , a+c , b+c ) : 1 . Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception form hormonal contraception comparable efficacy ( failure rate &lt; 1 % ) ; example , hormone vaginal ring transdermal hormone contraception . 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) 3 . Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository . Oral contraceptive ( OC ) , inject implanted hormonal method allow sole method contraception BGJ398 characterize respect potential interfere PK and/or effectiveness OCs . If woman nonchildbearing potential , must either : Be postmenopausal define 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) , OR Have surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman must confirm followup hormone level assessment . Sexually active male must use condom intercourse take drug three month last dose study drug . They father child period . Men undergone vasectomy also require use condom intercourse prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . Clinical suspicion active CIS . Evidence &gt; 1 area CIS associate papillary tumor . Evidence &gt; 7 tumor present bladder . History evidence advance urothelial carcinoma , include enlarge lymph node and/or distant metastasis . Evidence upper tract urothelial carcinoma . History another primary malignancy within last 3 year except : Adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix Nonmelanoma carcinoma skin Any curatively treat malignancy treat prior 3 month expect require treatment recurrence course study . Patients receive prior treatment selective FGFR inhibitor . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral BGJ398 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . History and/or current evidence tissue calcification include , limited , soft tissue , kidney , intestine , myocardium , lung exception calcify lymph node asymptomatic vascular calcification . Current evidence endocrine alteration calcium/phosphate homeostasis , e.g. , parathyroid disorder , history parathyroidectomy , tumor lysis , tumoral calcinosis , etc . Use medication increase serum level phosphorus and/or calcium ( e.g. , calcium , phosphate , vitamin D , parathyroid hormone ; ) . Current evidence corneal retinal disorder/keratopathy include , limited , bullous/band keratopathy , corneal abrasion , inflammation/ulceration , and/or keratoconjunctivitis , confirm ophthalmologic examination Treatment follow anticancer therapy prior first dose BGJ398 within state timeframes : Cyclical chemotherapy ( intravenous ) within period time short cycle length use treatment ( e.g. , 6 week nitrosourea , mitomycinC ) . Biological therapy ( e.g. , antibody include bevacizumab ) within period time ≤ 5 halflives ≤ 4 week , whichever short , prior start study drug . Continuous intermittent small molecule therapeutic within period time ≤ 5 halflives ≤ 4 week ( whichever short ) prior start study drug . Any investigational agent within period time ≤ 5 halflives less cycle length use treatment ≤ 4 week ( whichever shortest ) prior start study drug . Wide field radiotherapy ( include therapeutic radioisotope strontium 89 ) ≤ 4 week limited field radiation palliation ≤ 2 week prior start study drug . Patients currently receive treatment agent know strong inducer inhibitor CYP3A4 Consumption grapefruit , grapefruit juice , grapefruit hybrid , pomelo , pomegranate , star fruit , Seville oranges relate product within 7 day prior first dose Use herbal preparations/medications ( include , limited : St. John 's wort , Kava , ephedra ( huang ) , gingko bilboa , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , yohimbe , saw palmetto , ginseng within 7 day prior first dose .
