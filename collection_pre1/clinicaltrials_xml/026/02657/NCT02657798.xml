	<brief_title>RESIST : Understanding Role Depression Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Depression know associate development cardiovascular disease poor prognosis cardiac event , however mechanisms mediate link poorly understood . Inflammatory neuroendocrine process think play important role relationship . In addition , antidepressant show improve cardiac outcome anti-inflammatory effect , whilst inflammation show elevated patient respond treatment . Several possible biomarkers antidepressant resistance also demonstrate cardiovascular risk marker . These include acute phase inflammatory marker , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA ) dysregulation . Design : This conduct alongside large pharmacological trial , PANDA , participant recruit primary care randomize sertraline ( SSRI ) placebo . The RESIST study compare inflammatory cardiovascular risk factor depress patient take sertraline , depressed patient take placebo healthy control . This achieve investigating pharmacological effect antidepressant gene expression , glucocorticoid mineralocorticoid receptor function regulatory T cell ( Treg ) profile .</detailed_description>
