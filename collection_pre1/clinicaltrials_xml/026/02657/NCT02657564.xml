	<brief_title>Renal Safety Bowel Preparation With Polyethylene Glycol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) commonly use bowel cleanse agent colonoscopy world . PEGs non-absorbable isosmotic solution pass bowel without net absorption secretion . Significant fluid electrolyte shift therefore attenuate . However , several study show PEG may also impair renal function . One recent population-based study report use PEG associate increase risk acute kidney injury . The renal safety PEG Taiwanese patient report .</detailed_description>
