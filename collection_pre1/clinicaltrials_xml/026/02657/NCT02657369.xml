	<criteria>1 . Participants must histological diagnosis consistent Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer ( ATC ) . Cytologic diagnosis fine needle aspiration alone sufficient . Histologic diagnosis may make core needle biopsy , incisional biopsy , thyroidectomy , surgical biopsy . Fresh tumor biopsy ( rebiopsy ) obtain whenever feasible . The central pathology review may take place prior participant start treatment lenvatinib . 1 . Central review pathology require study participation , require prior enrollment start treatment order avoid delay . If result central pathology review available prior start study treatment , confirmation diagnosis ATC local laboratory mandatory prior schedule start treatment lenvatinib . 2 . If central pathology review indicate diagnosis ATC , participant may continue treatment lenvatinib per standard care , discretion treat investigator . Participants deem another diagnosis ( ATC ) take study replace purpose efficacy analysis . 3 . Differentiated thyroid carcinoma ( DTC ) focus loci ATC allow . If participant pathology show small focus ATC arise DTC measurable disease fully consistent ATC , confirmation ATC biopsy require . 4 . An incidental focus medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) , DTC , and/or poorly differentiate thyroid cancer participant ATC allow . 5 . Histological diagnosis ATC make surgical resection also acceptable . 2 . Prior neoadjuvant , adjuvant , palliative chemotherapy ATC allow . 3 . Measurable disease base investigator 's assessment meet follow criterion : 1 . At least 1 lesion ≥ 10 millimeter ( mm ) long diameter nonlymph node ≥ 15 mm shortaxis diameter lymph node serially measurable accord Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 use computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . 2 . Lesions external beam radiotherapy locoregional therapy radiofrequency ablation must show evidence subsequent progressive disease ( substantial size increase ≥ 20 % ) deem target lesion . 4 . Participants know brain metastasis complete whole brain radiotherapy , stereotactic radiosurgery , complete surgical resection eligible remain clinically stable , asymptomatic , steroid 1 month prior enrollment . 5 . All previous chemotherapy radiation therapyrelated toxicity , except dry mouth , dysphagia , esophagitis , mucositis , alopecia , irreversible late sequela radiation therapy , must resolve Grade 0 1 per Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE v 4.03 ) , wound prior surgery must adequately recover . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . 7 . Blood pressure ( BP ) ≤ 140/90 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) screen without antihypertensive medication change antihypertensive medication within 1 week prior Cycle 1/Day 1 . 8 . Adequate renal function evidence calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 millimeter/ minute ( mL/min ) accord Cockcroft Gault formula . 9 . Adequate bone marrow function : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/liter ( L ) 2 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 grams/deciliter ( g/dL ) ( correct growth factor transfusion ) 3 . Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L . 10 . Adequate blood coagulation function evidence International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 . 11 . Adequate liver function : 1 . Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) except unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia Gilbert 's syndrome ; 2 . Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 3 x ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN participant liver metastasis ) . If ALP &gt; 3 x ULN ( absence liver metastasis ) &gt; 5 x ULN ( presence liver metastasis ) AND participant also know bone metastasis , liverspecific ALP must separate total use ass liver function instead total ALP . 12 . Voluntary agreement provide write informed consent willingness ability comply aspects protocol . 1 . Differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) MTC . However , ATC arise DTC allow , long measurable disease clinically consistent ATC i.e. , rapidly progressive and/or 18F fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) avid . 2 . Newly diagnose participant consider appropriate candidate comprehensive multimodality treatment ( involve surgery and/or external beam radiotherapy chemo radiotherapy ) . 3 . Prior treatment lenvatinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) ( except combination therapy radiation reduce dose TKI give purpose radiosensitization ) . 4 . Major surgery within 2 week prior first dose lenvatinib . 5 . Any anticancer treatment within 14 day investigational agent within 30 day first dose study drug . 6 . Radiotherapy within 3 week prior first dose lenvatinib . 7 . Participants &gt; 1 + proteinuria urine dipstick test undergo 24 hour urine collection quantitative assessment proteinuria . Participants urine protein ≥ 1 gram/24 hour ineligible . 8 . Significant cardiovascular impairment : History ( ) congestive heart failure great New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II , ( b ) unstable angina , ( c ) myocardial infarction , ( ) stroke , ( e ) cardiac arrhythmia associate impairment within 6 month first dose study drug . 9 . A clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality , include mark Baseline prolong QT/QTc interval ( e.g. , repeated demonstration QTc interval &gt; 500 millisecond ( msec ) ) . 10 . Active infection require systemic therapy . 11 . Clinically significant hemoptysis tumor bleed within two week prior first dose lenvatinib . 12 . Radiographic evidence major blood vessel invasion/infiltration . 13 . Other active malignancy ( except definitively treat melanoma insitu , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma insitu cervix bladder ) within past 24 month . 14 . Scheduled major surgery study . 15 . Females breastfeed pregnant Screening Baseline ( document positive betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ ßhCG ] human chorionic gonadotropin [ hCG ] test minimum sensitivity 25 international units/liter ( IU/L ) equivalent unit ßhCG [ hCG ] ) . A separate Baseline assessment require negative screening pregnancy test obtain 72 hour first dose study drug . 16 . Females childbearing potential : 1 . Do agree use highly effective method contraception ( ie , total abstinence , [ prefer usual lifestyle ] , intrauterine device intrauterine system , contraceptive implant , oral contraceptive , vasectomized partner confirm azoospermia ) within 30 day study entry throughout entire study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . 2 . Are currently totally abstinent ( preferred usual lifestyle ) , agree totally abstinent study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . 3 . Are use hormonal contraceptive stable dose hormonal contraceptive product least 4 week dose agree use contraceptive study 30 day study drug discontinuation . 4 . Are use oral hormonal contraceptive agree add barrier method . ( NOTE : All female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal [ amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month , appropriate age group , without know suspected cause ] sterilize surgically [ i.e . bilateral tubal ligation , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , surgery least 1 month dose ] ) . For site outside European Union ( EU ) , permissible highly effective method contraception appropriate acceptable subject , subject must agree use medically acceptable method contraception , i.e . double barrier method contraception condom plus diaphragm cervical/vault cap spermicide . 17 . Evidence clinically significant disease ( e.g. , cardiovascular , respiratory , gastrointestinal , renal disease ) opinion investigator ( ) could affect participant 's safety interfere study assessment . 18 . Known intolerance study drug excipients . 19 . Any medical condition opinion investigator ( ) would preclude participant 's participation clinical study .</criteria>
