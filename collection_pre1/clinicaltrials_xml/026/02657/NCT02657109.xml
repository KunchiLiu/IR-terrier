	<brief_summary>4 consecutive day volunteer first fourth postoperative period cardiac valve replacement . The volunteer randomize 2 group : Control Group submit cardiac rehabilitation protocol hospital conduct study , consist respiratory metabolic exercise . The second group , call Early Mobilization Group addition aforementioned exercise add exercise cycle ergometer . For implementation rehabilitation protocol early mobilization group volunteer place sit position bed backrest raise 45 ° . The exercise cycle ergometer hold 20 minute four consecutive day active mode , train load shall voluntary maintain throughout train level fatigue , maintain level heart rate predict age increase 70 % 1 w / cm2 every minute keep parameter within standard . The evaluation heart rate variability Polar monitor RS800CX brand model surgery perform first postoperative day fifth postoperative day control group early mobilization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The valve disorder special group heart diseases long period without clinical manifestation , appearance symptom , patient likely candidate surgery . In many surgical complication occur , include respiratory cause immobility bed culminate need intensive care . Early mobilization exercise conduct physical therapy critically ill patient minimize complication related immobility bed surgery perform exchange heart valve . To investigate influence cardiac rehabilitation program cardiac function ( Heart Rate Varibility ) free radical ( oxidative stress ) patient undergo surgical heart valve replacement . The study conduct Clinical Hospital Gaspar Viana Belém , March 2014 period March 2016 , propose institution Methodist University Piracicaba . The study include 60 volunteer age 18 60 year old male surgery schedule heart valve replacement . The volunteer divide 2 group control group underwent rehabilitation propose hospital simple exercise like deep breathing exercise improve cough , move arm rhythmically legs maintain joint mobility , second group It call Early Mobilization Group , volunteer beyond rehabilitation protocol propose hospital , hold exercise cycle ergometer , The volunteer instruct pedal lying comfortably moderate intensity 30 minute . All group perform protocol last 4 day . Oxidative stress analyze cardiac function surgery , surgery first fifth postoperative . The Oxidative Stress analyze puncture drop blood analyze photograph area coagulum form . Cardiac function ( Heart Rate Variability ) analyze use heart rate monitor brand Polar® RS800CX model evaluate lying , data transfer computer analyze program call Kubios HRV . After collect data analyze Biostat 5.2 program . The possible risk research subject inconvenience collect blood sample , onset pain result mobilization rehabilitation protocol . However , emergence least one risk mention , procedure / service must stop perform passive stretch temporary home everything return normal . In addition , may risk contamination volunteer collect blood , however risk minimize use material sterile needle blade . The research bring benefit increase range motion muscle strength , decrease pain , functional improvement , provide improvement quality life functional independence reduce hospital stay .</detailed_description>
