	<brief_summary>Embryo culture selection continuous challenge evolution since birth In Vitro Fertilization ( IVF ) . Traditionally , embryo quality presume suitability transfer assess base morphologic feature . However , consensus optimal time point embryo assessment 'preferable ' characteristic challenge . Alongside challenge achieve balance multiple point assessment , yet stabilize embryo environment growth . In standard incubation , new morphological assessment embryos culture theoretically create additional disruption culture . Most recently , time-lapse incubator ( TLI ) introduce novel embryo culture system attempt limit culture disturbance . These incubator integrate digital imaging , allow substantial limitation embryo handle environmental disturbance . They also introduce new morphokinetic parameter embryo assessment optimize selection embryo . Thus far , limited number study examine clinical outcome value time lapse monitor system versus ubiquitous incubator ( e.g . multichamber ) reproductive outcome . In particular , isolated value morphokinetics embryo assessment new stable culture environment TLI still question . The objective study prospectively assess compare fertility outcomes embryos culture TLI system versus traditional bench incubator ( BI ) . We specifically assess add value close isolated TLI compare BI reproductive outcome , well value morphokinetic grading IVF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Time-Lapse Incubation Embryo Culture - Morphokinetics Environmental Stability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Objectives : We reach new age opportunity advance theoretically well culture environments improvement measure embryo assessment . The objective research study evaluate compare reproductive outcome isolate one two new intervention introduce Time-Lapse Incubator ( TLI ) system . The first assessment TLI environment compare standard Bench Incubator ( BI ) environment . The second assessment add morphokinetic grading embryo compare traditional morphologic grade alone . Although primary objective study focus clinical pregnancy rate fresh embryo transfer , research use embryos frozen study conduct also evaluate cumulative pregnancy rate per oocyte pick-up ( OPU ) cycle future . Methods The current study prospective randomize double-blinded study use three patient arm . The first arm include patient randomized embryo culture tri-gas bench incubator ( Miri , Benchtop Multi-room incubator ) . These embryos undergo multiple evaluation use light microscopy traditional morphologic assessment accord accept criterion . The second arm include patient randomized embryo culture time-lapse incubator ( Miri TL , Time-Lapse Incubator ) . These embryos remain TLI undergo morphologic morphokinetic evaluation grade accord multivariable scoring model . They remove incubation duration culture . The third arm include patient also randomize embryo culture time-lapse incubator ( Miri TL , Time-Lapse Incubator ) . These embryos remain TLI undergo traditional morphologic assessment accord accept criterion additional imaging . They also remove incubation duration culture . The time point evaluate parameter identical arm 1 study . Patients assessed suitability , inclusion exclusion criterion physician nursing team prior initiation IVF/ICSI cycle centre . Once patient deem eligible , member care team discus detail study patient . Approved study subject undergo standard control ovarian hyperstimulation ( COH ) . Protocols correspond medication decide upon discretion treat physician . These may include long gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist protocol GnRH antagonist protocol . Follicular aspiration perform IVF unit via transvaginal needle aspiration . Endometrial preparation luteal phase support recommend per departmental protocol . The number embryo transfer define prior cycle initiation , accord The Israel Society Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology . Patient randomization occur Human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( hCG ) administration already ensure , prior Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection ( ICSI ) . The randomization procedure accomplish use computer-generated randomization . After follicular aspiration transfer laboratory , follicular fluid examine presence oocyte . Oocytes score maturity morphologically abnormal feature . ICSI perform use fresh sperm corresponding partner . Embryos place culture medium . The embryo within culture medium place either Miri Benchtop Miri Timelapse incubator accord correspond group randomization . Note environment Miri benchtop Miri TL incubator consider identical . oxygen concentration carbon dioxide concentration set 5 % 5.5 % respectively . Embryos arm 1 study ( Miri Benchtop incubator ) morphologically assess light microscopy pre-defined time point accord accept criterion one train laboratory embryologist . The time point evaluation 16 - 20 hour post-ICSI ( normal fertilization ) , 44 - 48 hour ( day 2 ) post-ICSI , 64 - 72 hour ( day 3 ) post-ICSI . Evaluated parameter include cell number , cell size , cell symmetry , percent fragmentation . Any gross abnormality note . Embryos grade day 3 accord evaluate parameter transfer accord preferential grading . If embryo transfer predetermine day 5 , additional assessment take place approximately 116 hour . Embryos arm 2 study ( Miri TL incubator ) morphologically morphokinetically assessed laboratory embryologist use digital image generate incubator 's integrated time-lapse imaging system . Assessment score perform per score classification system . Morphological screen embryo initially perform order discard exclude clearly viable transfer . Morphokinetic parameter use order rank remain embryo score category maximum 4.0 minimum -2.0 , order hypothesize decrease implantation potential . Embryos arm 3 study ( Miri TL incubator ) morphologically assessed embryologist use digital image generate incubator 's integrated time-lapse imaging system . As noted , time point evaluate parameter identical arm 1 study . Decisions embryo transfer also identical . For patient , embryos select transfer base morphologic score alone ( Arm 1 3 ) morphokinetic decision tree scoring ( Arm 2 ) . The number embryos transfer pre-determined ( note ) . Those embryos select deemed appropriate future transfer undergo cryopreservation vitrification . Blinding current study ensure multiple point . The gynecologist perform oocyte retrieval embryo transfer blind predefined randomized patient group . Patients unaware group randomization . Statisticians also blind group randomization calculate pregnancy outcomes . It unfortunately possible ensure blind embryologist perform morphologic morphokinetic assessment . Sample Size calculation : The pregnancy rate IVF Unit sub-group patient demographic clinical characteristic similar include study , 40 % . Assuming TLI group pregnancy rate increase 10 % , sample size require per group 124 patient per arm , alpha risk 5 % power 80 % . Statistics : The statistical analysis do intention treat .</detailed_description>
