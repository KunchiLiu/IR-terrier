	<detailed_description>PriMatrix ( TEI Medical Inc ) promise collagen membrane derive fetal bovine dermis . The acellular porous structure membrane permit rapid re-vascularization cellular re-population . The membrane contain high proportion type III collagen . Type III collagen help regulate tissue heal promote neoepithelialization angiogenesis . Wounds graft PriMatrix exhibit significantly faster heal rate compare control wound minimal foreign body response early repopulation progenitor cell . The ability PriMatrix permit neovascularization , reepithelialization , minimal immune response , population progenitor cell suggest may serve ideal alternative CTG CPF root coverage . In regard , current study aim serve pilot test feasibility use PriMatrix graft material CPF attain root coverage Miller Class I &amp; II defect .</detailed_description>
