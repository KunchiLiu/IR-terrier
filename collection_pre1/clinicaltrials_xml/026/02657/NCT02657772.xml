	<brief_title>Ultra Coils From Start Finish Endovascular Repair Small Intracranial Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Prospective single-arm multi-center Registry aim collect data determine safety efficacy one market coil , namely Target速 360 Ultra coil . This intervention treatment study . Up 100 subject 6 site enrol . Study Procedure 1 . Screening Informed consent : Patients undergo endovascular treatment intracranial aneurysm screen use Eligibility criterion checklist , enrol use approve Institutional Informed Consent process approve Informed Consent form . 2 . Baseline assessment : This involve standard care history , medical examination laboratory assessment prior coil procedure . 3 . Coiling procedure 4 . One day post procedure assessment 5 . 3- 28 day post procedure assessment 6 . 3-9 month post procedure assessment 7 . 9-18 month post procedure assessment The Site investigator and/or co-investigator representative ( ) conduct train initiate study develop common understand clinical protocol , Case Report Forms , study procedure among investigator site research staff . Regulatory binder study protocol , train document , standard operate guideline provide study site . The Principal investigator and/or co-investigator shall confirm data receive accurate review provider collect data . The principle investigator and/or co-investigator approve data receive . Additionally , OpenClinica , web-based data capture service , receive Case Report Forms . Study Monitoring electronic require upload de-identified source document provide secure channel . However site visit maybe schedule advance site personnel . Audits may also perform quality assurance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient 18 80 year age ( inclusive ) . 2 . Patient document untreated intracranial aneurysm less equal 5.0 mm maximal dimension , rupture unruptured , suitable embolization coil . 3 . Target速 Ultra coil may use . 4 . Target aneurysm completely nearly completely coiled index procedure ( No stag treatment procedure ) without anticipate need target aneurysm reintervention 72 hour index procedure . If stent place separate preliminary procedure , screen enrollment coil procedure must take place stenting procedure complete . 5 . Target aneurysm morphology allows adequate retention coil within aneurysmal sac without occlusion parent artery , determine treat physician . 6 . Patient ( patient 's legally authorize representative ) provide write informed consent . 7 . Patient willing able comply protocol followup requirement . 1 . Patient &lt; 18 &gt; 80 year old . 2 . Target aneurysm felt physician operator mycotic clearly dissect etiology . 3 . Target aneurysm &gt; 5.0 mm maximum luminal dimension . 4 . Target aneurysm previously treat surgery endovascular therapy . 5 . Target aneurysm physician 's estimation unlikely successfully treat endovascular technique . 6 . Patient present Hunt Hess grade IV V rupture aneurysm . 7 . Patient known hypersensitivity platinum , tungsten , nickel , stainless steel structurally related compound find Target速 Ultra coil . 8 . Patients could severe reaction contrast agent adequately premedicated prior coiling procedure . 9 . Patients unable complete schedule follow assessment enrol center due limited life expectancy ( &lt; 24 month ) , comorbidities geographical consideration . 10 . Patients MoyaMoya disease , brain arteriovenous malformation ( ) , significant atherosclerotic stenosis , tortuousity condition prevent access target aneurysm . 11 . Target aneurysm significant thrombosis may increase likelihood recanalization discretion investigator . 12 . Female patient positive pregnancy assessment baseline , breastfeed patient , patient plan become pregnant within 18 month follow coiling . 13 . History medical noncompliance history substance abuse within past 12 month . 14 . The following comorbidities may confound result : ( ) uncontrolled hypertension ; ( b ) uncontrolled diabetes ; ( c ) organ failure kidney , liver , heart , lung ; ( ) myocardial infarction within past 6 month ; ( e ) contradiction aspirin , clopidogrel , heparin ; and/or ( f ) uncorrectable coagulation abnormality . 15 . More one intracranial aneurysm treat index coil procedure . 16 . History major trauma major surgery within 30 day prior index coil procedure .</criteria>
