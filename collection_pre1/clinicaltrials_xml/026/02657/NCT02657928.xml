	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ribociclib letrozole work treat patient estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal , endometrial cancer return ( come back ) period improvement . Ribociclib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Cancer cell estrogen receptor positive may need estrogen grow . Letrozole lower amount estrogen make body may stop growth tumor cell need estrogen grow . Giving ribociclib together letrozole may effective treatment patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal , endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ribociclib Letrozole Treating Patients With Relapsed ER Positive Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal , Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Demonstrate combination letrozole ribociclib ( LEE011 ) lead high percentage patient progression free 12 week ( PFS 12 ) compare observed prior study single agent letrozole . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Demonstrate combination letrozole ribociclib ( LEE011 ) lead high cancer antigen 125 ( CA-125 ) response rate patient relapse ER positive ovarian cancer endometrial cancer compare observe previously report single agent letrozole study . II . Median progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , confirm response rate , adverse event . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Identify molecular biomarkers associate response treatment letrozole ribociclib ( LEE011 ) ( patient relapse ovarian carcinoma endometrial cancer ) . II . Develop patient derive xenograft ( PDX ) avatars tumor participant possible future translational study evaluate potential correlation response PDX model patient ' response . OUTLINE : Patients receive ribociclib orally ( PO ) daily letrozole PO daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
