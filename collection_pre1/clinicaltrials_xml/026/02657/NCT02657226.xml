	<brief_title>Intensive Monitoring Renal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intensive monitoring renal function provide early opportunity modify attenuate certain risk factor ( e.g. , nephrotoxin exposure ) AKI . Intensive monitoring urine output ( UO ) provide real-time continuous assessment renal function ICU . However , association intensive monitoring less-intensive monitoring urine output , without close monitoring serum creatinine ( sCr ) , susceptibility AKI outcomes AKI unknown . Our preliminary data indicate intensive monitoring UO associate low hospital mortality compare less-intensive monitoring patient develop AKI . If intensive monitoring renal function associate low risk AKI improve outcome AKI , monitor technique could widely use hospitalized patient include non-intensive care setting either prevent AKI progression AKI . Therefore , observational retrospective cohort study aim compare outcomes patient undergo intensive monitoring renal function ( UO and/or sCr ) patient undergo less intensive monitoring . Outcomes include mortality within 30 day ICU admission among critically ill patient without AKI . Development severe AKI within 7 day ICU admission fluid overload ICU day patient develop severe AKI ( KDIGO stage 3 ) also assess . This study utilize large , heterogeneous cohort ( n=~65,800 ) critically ill patient admit ICU 12 year period University Pittsburgh Medical Center . The study population consist patient receive intensive monitoring UO ( define measure least every 2 hour within first 48 hour ICU admission ) strict creatinine measurement ( define least daily ) . Patients fail meet criterion intensive monitoring control ( less-intensive monitoring group ) . AKI diagnose accord KDIGO stage 1-3 criterion 7-day period . Mortality 30-days ICU admission ascertain use social security death master file . In order account indication bias , propensity score intensive monitoring build use various risk factor . Risk severity illness-adjusted estimate generate susceptibility AKI mortality AKI intensive less-intensive monitoring group .</detailed_description>
