	<brief_title>Bardoxolone Methyl Patients With Connective Tissue Disease-associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension - CATALYST</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial study safety , tolerability , efficacy bardoxolone methyl qualify patient WHO Group I CTD-PAH . Qualified patient randomize 1:1 either bardoxolone methyl placebo administer daily 24 week . Patients randomize placebo remain placebo throughout study . Patients randomize bardoxolone methyl start 5 mg dose-escalate 10 mg Week 4 unless contraindicate clinically . Dose de-escalation permitted study indicate clinically . All patient study follow visit assessment schedule . Following randomization , patient schedule assessed person treatment Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 16 , 24 telephone contact Days 3 , 10 , 21 , 31 , 38 , 84 , 140 . Patients also schedule assess person follow visit Week 28 , four week end treatment .</detailed_description>
