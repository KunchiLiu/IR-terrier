	<detailed_description>Women invasive carcinoma breast negative axillary node DCIS , follow BCS and/or chemotherapy , meet inclusion criterion screen approached eligibility assessment potential study enrollment . All potentially eligible consent patient meet exclusion criterion Computed Tomography ( CT ) simulation ipsilateral breast prior randomization . All case require planned prior randomization ensure dosimetric coverage normal tissue restriction meet . If seroma clearly visible surgical clip adequately identify previous surgical cavity , patient eligible randomization . Eligible , consent patient randomly allocate receive radiotherapy 3DCRT APBI 30Gy 5 daily fraction 6Gy 27.5Gy 5 daily fraction 5.5Gy one week . Patients follow 12 , 24 , 36 60 month post randomization . Cosmetic outcome measure use photograph evaluate panel train radiation oncologist use EORTC Breast Cosmetic Rating System . Radiation toxicity assess use NCI CTCAE version 4.02 . The primary outcome adverse cosmetic outcome 2 year . The trial conduct clinical centre within Canada .</detailed_description>
