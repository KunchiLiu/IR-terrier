	<brief_title>Myrcludex B Plus Pegylated Interferon-alpha-2a Patients With Chronic Hepatitis Delta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design evaluate safety efficacy MXB subset HBV infect patient co-infected hepatitis delta virus ( HDV ) . Hepatitis delta represent severe form chronic viral hepatitis approve treatment option available patient infect HBV HDV . 24 patient randomise 3 arm : pre-treatment MXB follow pegylated interferon-alpha-2a ( PEG-INF-a ) treatment versus combination drug versus pegylated interferon-alpha-2a . Prolonged blockade HBV entry hepatocytes also block infection HDV particle ( us HBsAg envelope ) thus provide therapeutic option otherwise hardly treatable disease . PEG-INF-a use treatment chronic hepatitis delta . The study endpoints virological response ( HBsAg , HDV RNA , HBV DNA ) , well safety tolerability drug immunogenicity .</detailed_description>
