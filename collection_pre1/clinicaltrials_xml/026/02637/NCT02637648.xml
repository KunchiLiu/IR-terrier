	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effect sodium oxybate headache response ( frequency ) , sleep quality quality life prophylactic treatment patient chronic episodic cluster headache . Oral sodium oxybate , 3-9g per night , start 3g two nightly dosages 1.5g increased step 1.5g every second third night treatment Response evaluate interventional , placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomise , parallel group , multicentre study . Primary outcome reduction nocturnal pain frequency Secondary outcomes improvement sleep quality subjective level assess diary standardized scale ( PSQI , FOSQ ) , duration pain free episode , general clinical outcome ( global evaluation ) , clinical global impression ( CGI-S , CGI-I , CGI-E ) , quality life ( SF 36 ) daytime sleepiness ( Epworth Sleepiness Score ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multicenter study test safety efficacy sodium oxybate prophylaxis headache sleep disturbance patient chronic episodic cluster headache use placebo-controlled , double blind , randomize study , parallel group design . Patients predominant nocturnal attack poor sleep quality evaluate ; At least 1 attack every day least 8 attack cumulatively time prior randomization require . Sodium oxybate orally administer , 3-9g per night , start 3g two nightly dosages 1.5g ( first bedtime second 4 hour later ) . Dosage gradually increase step 1.5g every second night treatment response titration period 14 day . Effects od sodium oxybate monitor via pain sleep diary 14 day stable treatment phase review sleep/pain diary Quality life assessement . Primary outcome frequency nocturnal pain attack ; Main secondary outcome frequency , intensity duration daytime pain attack , improvement sleep quality , quality life , duration rate pain free episode , decrease escape medication acute headache attack ( use triptans ) . Safety parameter ECG , laboratory , depression scale , vital sign , respiratory polygraphy . Intent-to treat analysis , multivariate analysis variance ( MANOVA ) depend variable ( reduction pain frequency pain intensity nocturnal attack ) co-variates ( age , sex , chronic vs. episodic CH ) .</detailed_description>

Diagnosis cluster headache make least 6 week start screen 3 . Patients nocturnal pain attack 4 . Duration since onset current cluster episode least 1 week 5 . Patients least 1 attack per 48 hour least 4 attack cumulatively time visit 2 ( prior randomization ) 6 . Disturbed sleep quality 7 . Patients express willingness participate complete study , sign date informed consent prior begin protocol require procedure . 8 . Women must surgically sterile 2 year postmenopausal . Females childbearing potential must use medically accepted effective method birth control . Patients agree continue method duration study one month discontinuation SO treatment . Women negative serum pregnancy test perform screen visit . Females breastfeed patient . 9 . In opinion investigator , patient must adequate support comply entire study requirement describe protocol ( e.g. , transportation trial site , self rating scale diary completion , drug compliance , schedule visit , test ) . 10 . If indicated investigator , patient must willing operate car heavy machinery 6 hour last intake investigational drug duration trial long investigator deem clinically indicate . In addition , patient willing abstain study alcohol consumption behaviour could interact investigational drug . 1 . The use sodium oxybate previous investigational drug within 30day period prior initial screen visit ( V1 ) trial . 2 . Change prophylactic treatment 2 week prior baseline visit 1 3 . Have sleep apnea syndrome , define Apnea index &gt; 10 per hour Apneahypopnea Index ( AHI ) &gt; 15/h oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ) &gt; 15/h 4 .
