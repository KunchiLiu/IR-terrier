	<detailed_description>Title : Phase I , pilot study healthy volunteer , assess safety pharmacokinetics PCO-02 , active ingredient BPC-157 , pentadecapeptide gastric source . Protocol Number : BPC-1A/B-1.2 Phase : I Population : Healthy subject , male female , 18 35 year age . Number Sites : Single center , perform Hospital Angeles , Tijuana . Duration Study : Six month , January 01 , 2015 Jun 30 , 2015 . Duration Subject Participation : Three week Intervention description : The study consist oral administration PCO-02 tablet , contain 1mg BPC-157 placebo . There two different administration scheme , label Phase 1a Phase 1b . - Phase 1a : Single dose administration 1 , 3 6 tablet PCO-02 placebo . - Phase 1b : Oral administration 3 tablet PCO-02 placebo three time daily 2 week . Study Goals : General : To assess , healthy volunteer , safety pharmacokinetics oral administration PCO-02 , pharmacological active product BPC-157 . - Primary : To assess safety oral administration BPC-157 . - Secondary : To document pharmacokinetics BPC-157 oral administration . Study Design : This phase-I , randomize , placebo control , pilot study , group 42 healthy volunteer receive orally active compound ( PCO-02 ) placebo ( PCO-03 ) ass safety pharmacokinetics . Phase 1a : There three cohort group , 14 subject , receive single oral dose 1 , 3 6 tablet PCO-02 , respectively similar dose placebo ( PCO-03 ) . Randomization PCO-02-to-placebo ratio 6:1 group , keep balance men woman among group . For phase , subject admit hospital 24 hour keep fast administration study medication . Serial blood urine sample obtain document pharmacokinetics BPC-157 peptide subject group observe AE order determine study medication 's safety . A week , subject return clinical assessment laboratory blood work continue monitor AE 's . Also , cohort receive 3 tablet receive second dose similar manner meal . Phase 1b : This second phase initiate subject prior phase complete least one week follow-up SAE 's related study medication phase 1a . All subject phase 1a receive single dose 3 tablet PCO-02 placebo three time daily period 14 day . The assignment active ( PCO-02 ) placebo ( PCO-02 ) per randomization phase 1a . This phase perform ambulatory manner , subject require return clinic day 0 , 7 14 safety pharmacokinetics assessment . Estimated Time Complete Enrollment : One month Study Goals : Primary : Safety oral administration PCO-02 , evaluate thru systematic monitoring adverse event follow-up . Secondary : Pharmacokinetics oral BCP-157 ( Tmax , Cmax , T1/2 , AUC ) Clinical Assessment During Follow- Up : During phase 1a , subject admit hospital 24 hour monitor adverse event serial blood urine sample single dose PCO-02 placebo ( PCO-03 ) . Subjects discharge hospital next morning return week initial dose clinical assessment laboratory blood work continue monitor possible AE 's . The first cohort receive 1 tablet PCO-02 placebo . Increasing next dose require absence severe adverse event relate intervention previous dose cohort one week follow-up . If AE ` relate study medication , phase 1b start . Initial assessment phase 1b final evaluation phase 1a . All subject phase 1a receive single dose 3 tablet PCO-02 three time daily , similar dose placebo ( PCO-03 ) , period 2 week . The assignment active compound placebo phase 1a . The subject require return clinic day 7 14 clinical , pharmacokinetics safety assessment , include blood urine sampling .</detailed_description>
