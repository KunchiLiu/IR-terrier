	<brief_title>A Dose-Escalation Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics IPI-549</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study IPI-549-01 first-in-human multicenter , open-label , five-part Phase 1/1b dose-escalation study design evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) IPI-549 monotherapy IPI-549 combination nivolumab subject advance solid tumor . Approximately 175 subject receive IPI-549 , either monotherapy combination nivolumab . Subjects receive IPI-549 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) achieve disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Part A ( QD dose ) ( Part B ( BID dose ) necessary ) dose escalation part study evaluate safety tolerability , PK , PD IPI-549 single agent subject advance solid tumor . Part A/B determine recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) IPI-549 single agent go administered Part D single agent Part C combination nivolumab . Part C dose-escalation part study evaluate safety tolerability , PK , PD IPI-549 administer combination IV nivolumab 240 mg every 2 week ( Q2W ) subject advanced solid tumor . Part C determine RP2D combination IPI-549 nivolumab ( combination RP2D ) . Part D evaluate safety , tolerability , PK , PD , preliminary clinical activity IPI-549 administer single agent cohort subject advance solid tumor . Part D , Cycle 2 also include pilot food ( high-fat meal ) effect evaluation 8 subject entire cohort subject participate Part D. Part E evaluate safety , tolerability , PK , PD , preliminary clinical activity IPI-549 combination intravenous ( IV ) nivolumab 240 mg Q2W cohort subject non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , cohort subject melanoma cohort subject Squamous Cell Cancer Head Neck ( SCCHN ) . One cohorts subject additional tumor type may enrol support data generate dose escalation earlier expansion cohort . To eligible enrollment Part E , subject must receive anti-PD1/PD-L1 recent treatment prior study entry . The dose level administer Part E combination RP2D determine Part C .</detailed_description>
