	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) know motor symptom affect 100,000 Canadians . However , PD patient also show cognitive deficit neuropsychiatric problem significantly impair quality life . The occurrence dementia PD much high general population . The propose study allow principal investigator , team collaborator investigate origin evolution cognitive neuropsychiatric symptom . Participants PD without mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) participant without MCI age 60 year assess eight study visit three year . Through brain imaging , clinical testing , well genotyping cognitive pattern four different group observe compare . The result use identify biomarkers predict occurrence dementia early disease . Ultimately , result propose research contribute intervention treatment strategy tailor different cognitive profile PD occurrence dementia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study Mild Cognitive Impairment Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) second frequent chronic neurodegenerative disorder , affect 2 % among person older 65 year age nearly 10 % people 80 . The cardinal symptom PD include tremor , rigidity bradykinesia originate loss dopaminergic neuron striatum . It recently show non-motor symptom PD cognitive behavioural impairment highly prevalent severe direct negative effect health-related perceive quality life . It well establish 25 40 % person PD develop cognitive deficit early disease . Moreover , risk develop dementia almost six time higher PD patient age-matched control . The nature evolution cognitive deficit PD remain poorly understood , relationship neuropsychiatric feature often observe disease include depression , anxiety apathy . Furthermore , medication treatment cognitive deficit PD yield modest result . PD neuropathology associate alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy-Bodies whereas Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) usually associate Aß-amyloid plaque tau-containing neurofibrillary lesion . However , recent post-mortem study suggest 30 45 % PD patient dementia also meet neuropathologic diagnostic criterion AD . With high proportion demented PD patient concurrent AD , would valuable , therapeutic standpoint , identify AD earlier . In context present proposal investigator able follow different group PD patient longitudinally compare non-PD patient mild cognitive impairment risk develop medio-temporal lobe dementia Alzheimer 's disease . The three major aim longitudinal study : 1 . Identify anatomical functional neuroimaging , neuropsychological neuropsychiatric profile serve marker early prediction dementia PD . 2 . Uncover cognitive neural characteristic specific PD-MCI subject vs. characteristic share MCI subject whether due PD aetiology Alzheimer 's disease . 3 . Identify effect specific genotype influence cognitive profile evolution PD . The investigator recruit 100 PD 100 non-PD individual . None dementia . Participants select order obtain 65 % MCI 35 % cognitively intact individual cohort ( PD , non-PD ) . At study start ask consent blood draw genotyping purpose . At time point , receive neuropsychological evaluation determine whether domain ( ) cognition ( ) affect whether participant meet criteria dementia . At Time point 1 2 also undergo two MRI session contain anatomical acquisition well BOLD functional series perform executive ( set-shifting ) task investigator show rely fronto-striatal region ( associative ) memory task solicit medial temporal lobe . At Time point 3 undergo one MRI session contain task . This allow investigator identify marker distinguish subgroup respect possible evolution towards dementia . This multi-faceted , longitudinal project promise enhance understanding nature evolution cognitive dysfunction PD relative general age . To investigator ' knowledge , first time PD non-PD patient stratify accord cognitive profile study longitudinally use neuropsychological evaluation , anatomical functional neuroimaging measure well genotyping . This information potential yield marker use clinic determine diagnosis prognosis cognitive dysfunction PD , allow early prediction dementia disease . This ultimately yield intervention treatment strategy tailor different patient subtypes , aim improve cognitive deficit decelerate decline .</detailed_description>
