	<detailed_description>Major depression independent risk factor incident cancer , recurrence mortality . Women chronic major depression exhibit four-fold increased rate incident breast cancer 39 % high mortality rate compare non-depressed woman breast cancer . Although precise biological mechanism link depression cancer progression remain unclear , elevated concentration systemic inflammatory biomarkers ( e.g. , pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) associate cytokine protein ) independently associate depression cancer progression . In context breast cancer , secretion tumor-derived cytokine know mechanism epithelial tumor able recruit immune cell ( MDSCs ) . The presence MDSCs primary tumor site favor tumor pathogenesis correlate aggressive breast cancer subtypes . At systemic level , increased level interleukin-6 , circulate MDSCs , circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) inflammatory marker bloodstream breast cancer patient find strongly correlate poor prognosis . Medical condition major depression associate increased level systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine , thereby create host environment promote cancer progression . Indeed , innate immune activation chronic inflammation implicate pathogenesis major depression may account biological mechanism link depression cancer progression . Several study show antidepressant treatment response attenuate normalizes pro-inflammatory cytokine plasma level medically-healthy patient depression . To date , three randomize control antidepressant study conduct depressed woman breast cancer . Two study find mainserin effective superior placebo , whereas paroxetine desipramine comparable placebo . Notably , several randomize control trial depress breast cancer patient find psychotherapy effective depression treatment . Moreover , study find psychotherapy significantly lengthen survival time depress breast cancer patient metastatic disease . Remarkably , randomize control trial examine impact antidepressant medication cancer survival . To date , randomize , placebo-controlled antidepressant study depress woman breast cancer investigate impact depression treatment cognition inflammatory mediator promote cancer progression . This study explore efficacy vortioxetine depression cognition woman breast cancer , determine whether successful treatment depression alters circulate cytokine , immune mediator , circulate tumor cell , thus elucidate possible mechanism explain improved cancer outcome effective antidepressant treatment . Given disproportionately high rate depression woman breast cancer negative impact cancer outcome , understand biological mechanism drive relationship critical . This study may uncover novel immune-mediated mechanism vortioxetine treatment ameliorates depression , enhance cognition , influence cancer outcome . Primary Objective - To assess antidepressant efficacy vortioxetine ( VTX ) treatment woman major depressive disorder ( MDD ) complete curative treatment Stage I , II III breast cancer . Primary Endpoint Antidepressant efficacy assess Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-21 ( HDRS-21 ) total score administer specified time point . Antidepressant response define 50 % reduction baseline HDRS-21 total score , treatment remission define HDRS-21 total score ≤7 . Antidepressants deem effective patient 's depression worsen . A participant 's depression classify `` bad '' ) participant become suicidal psychotic , b ) HAM-D score increase &gt; 18 , four-week period time : c ) HAM-D score increase , ) CGI Improvement Rating increase least one point . The definition antidepressant efficacy worsen depression remain Cycle 2 . - Cognitive function assess Brief Assessment Cognition Affective Disorders ( BAC-A ) test battery measure : ( 1 ) list learning , ( 2 ) digit sequence task , ( 3 ) token motor task , ( 4 ) verbal fluency , ( 5 ) tower London test , ( 6 ) symbol coding , ( 7 ) affective processing subtest . All BAC-A measure administer specify time point , total composite z-scores compare baseline total composite z-scores .</detailed_description>
