	<brief_title>Can Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter Measurement Predict Negative Neurological Outcome ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Current medical literature reveals life expectancy cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) 6.7-9.6 % .1,2 The hypoxic process , also refer post-resuscitation encephalopathy ( PRE ) , major factor affect neurological outcome follow return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) .3 Many study , aim early prediction neurological outcome via vital sign , score system , various biochemical marker image technique exist literature.1-8 Optic nerve part central nervous system posterior part cover dura mater . Studies find , elevation intracranial pressure ( ICP ) result elevated subarachnoid fluid pressure , lead increase optic nerve sheath diameter ( ONSD ) .9 Bedside USG measurement ONSD report utilizable evaluation ICP.9,10 Aim study : The primary aim study evaluate relationship bedside USG measurement ONSD follow ROSC CPR OHCA patient , early ( 3rd day ) neurological evaluation 30 day survival rate , propose increase ONSD may relate negative neurological outcome . Considering relationship find , secondary goal study establish , identify cut-off value ONSD relate negative neurological outcome optimal time measure ONSD . Material Methods : This study design multicenter , prospective , cohort clinical study . The Utstein Templates Resuscitation Registries use OHCA records.11 The associate researcher demand experience least 5 year USG use certify Emergency Medicine Association Turkey ( EMAT ) participate and/or faculty Emergency USG course ONSD evaluation , EMAT USG study group ( EMATUS ) , organize plan USG course Emergency Physicians . A one-day education standardize researcher study , theoretical implementation section plan hold author study , regard methodology study standardization USG techniques ONSD measurement . In implementation section , researcher perform ONSD measurement ocular USG healthy volunteer reliability among performer measure Interclass Correlation test . This study perform adult emergency department participate hospital , ethic committee approval . The OHCA patient present adult emergency department participate hospital render study population . The non-traumatic , non-intracranial event relate OHCA patient ROSC achieve render sample group . The sample size power 95 % calculate 203 patient . The patient whose available next kin give consent admit study . All patient receive standardize advanced cardiac life support ( ACLS ) measure line recent American Heart Association ( AHA ) guideline emergency department team , uncommitted study . Following ROSC , time period 20 minute determine order appropriate tissue perfusion state , systolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg mean arterial pressure ≥65 mmHg peripheral capillary saturation ≥94 % .14 ONSD measurement perform patient uninterrupted ROSC 20 minute bedside USG time achievement ROSC measurement record . The routine care plan patient manipulate . In case clinician decide cranial compute tomography ( CT ) indicate accord routine practice current guideline , copy CT image take investigate presence intracranial mass lead increase ICP . The neurologic evaluation patient study group perform three step . Primary neurological evaluation perform follow achievement appropriate tissue perfusion ROSC , prior sedative paralyze drug application . This step identify record alertness , presence activity , level motor response , brain stem reflexes myoclonic status epilepticus . The second neurological evaluation take place 72nd hour follow ROSC . The alertness , presence spontaneous motor activity , level motor response , brain stem reflexes myoclonic status epilepticus also identify record second step , well . The third evaluation evaluation neurological final outcome 30th day hospital discharge , utilize Modified Rankin Scale ( MRS ) . Statistical Package Social Sciences 22.0 Windows use statistical analysis . Descriptive statistical value present quantity percentiles categorical variable mean standard deviation numerical variable . Comparisons numerical variable two independent group perform Student-t Test normal distribution obtain Mann-Whitney U test obtain . The difference mean value categorical variable two independent group test Chi-Square analysis . The relationship numerical variable review Pearson Correlation analysis parametric test condition , Spearman Correlation Analysis non-parametric test condition . The appropriateness four separately measure ONSD value evaluate concordance correlation coefficient measurement . The cut-off value determine Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve Analysis . The statistical alpha significance level accept p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
