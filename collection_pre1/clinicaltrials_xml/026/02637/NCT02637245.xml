	<brief_summary>Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) common cause vision loss diabetic patient . While anti-VEGF treatment lesser extent corticosteroid macular photocoagulation improve outcome patient DME , single therapy universally effective currently priori mean determine patient respond best give therapy . The purpose study determine whether specific parameter ocular image study include optical coherence tomography fluorescein angiography predict response treatment patient DME . This prospective observational cohort study collect clinical data image study obtain standard care . Up 150 subject clinically significant DME enrol Duke Eye Center satellite office . These image study analyze determine whether specific parameter associated poor favorable response specific treatment . There intervention part observational trial , thus primary risk subject loss confidentiality , minimize study team .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize DME common endpoint cause differ pathobiology varies patient . Clinically fluorescein angiography ( FA ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) use diagnose assess diabetic retinopathy include DME . These two imaging modality provide different biological information FA give functional data regard perfusion integrity retinal water homeostasis system OCT give structural information include quantity location fluid patient DME . The investigator believe careful analysis leakage pattern FA characteristic intraretinal fluid OCT potential provide insight predominant mechanism DME individual patient . Specifically , propose least two form DME exist , focal diffuse . In focal DME , leakage see FA originate predominantly leak microaneurysms present retinal microvasculature , marker endothelial dysfunction focal breakdown blood retinal barrier . Similarly , hypothesize focal leakage image OCT result accumulation noncystic fluid extracellular space . In contrast , diffuse pattern leakage discernable source FA believe pattern represent failure Müller RPE cell pump function result accumulation intracellular fluid retina . Diffuse leakage image OCT may appear cystic fluid accumulation represent swollen Müller retinal cell . In clinical practice , patient DME mixture focal diffuse leakage one type predominant . The investigator hypothesize , driven disparate pathobiology , different DME subtypes respond differently treatment . Thus , may possible use fluorescein angiography and/or optical coherence tomography predict optimal treatment individual patient , thereby improve patient outcome possibly reduce treatment burden . To date , prospective study correlate FA OCT image parameter response specific therapy , prospective data use image parameter guide choice treatment modality subject DME . As first step toward determine whether image parameter predict treatment response , investigator prospectively collect image , treatment outcome data patient diabetic macular edema treat Duke Eye Center .</detailed_description>
