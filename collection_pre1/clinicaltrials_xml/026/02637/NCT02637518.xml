	<brief_summary>There prove strong evidence usefulness frailty predictive factor relevant desire outcome population old adult . Several study publish show utility concept improve prognosis accuracy prediction different risk ( hospitalisation , surgical non surgical complication , length stay , death , incident disability , etc . ) emergency department , surgical patient , inpatient cardiovascular disease . The study place focus assess population risk , validation process instrument diagnosis screening tool usually neglect . FRAILTOOLS aim assess usefulness screen diagnosis tool select instrument detect frailty clinical ( Hospital Primary Care ) social ( Nursing Homes ) setting , provide diagnostic algorithm clinically sound . Target group older adult risk frailty ( pre-frail ) plus frail risk develop disability . According publish prevalence two condition , target population concern project represent around 40-50 % people older 65 , 60-70 % people older 75 . Once determine best tool screen diagnosis different setting care , investigator research conclusion people wherever level care need currently use . The benefit spend Health System Social Care provide validate instrument necessary provide appropriate care older adult mean comprehensive , continue , coordinate integrate care .</brief_summary>

It include follow task : Making sure monitoring change documentation . Making sure activity 's coordination report complete accord adequate quality appropriate manner . Reviewing contract deliverable . Monitoring audit project 's activity accord plan , make specific revision contractual deliverable , direct achievement establish objective . The electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) design capture data require protocol . A unique eCRF complete subject , take account protection law country study.Subjects identify unique subject number ( key hold relevant partner ) , none identification card number record eCRF database . The monitor guarantee eCRF fully correctly fill accord source document . The researcher assure data record eCRF coincide information record source document . Plan miss data address situation variable report miss : The investigator check miss data eCRF source document . Statistical analysis : Investigator ass association scale outcome set outcome logistic regression . First , investigator compute classification performance ( sensitivity , specificity , Receptors Operational Curve ( ROC ) , Area Under Curve ( AUC ) , predictive value , likelihood ratio ) model . Second , investigator study feasibility model take account time need scale percentage patient assess per case . Investigators evaluate sensitivity change scale covariance scale measure SPPB mix linear model . Sample Size : Participants recruit Spain , Italy , France , United Kingdom Poland . The total sample 1.940 subject . Each participate centre recruit total 388 patient , correspond 97 subject clinical set centre .</detailed_description>
