Phase 1 build iteratively modify ( N=25 ) POST system Phase 2 test whether SCPs impact patient provider outcome use single blind , randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Breast cancer patient ( n=230 ) transition active treatment recruit randomly assign receive Treatment Usual ( n=115 ) POST ( n=115 ) . All participant assess 1 , 3 , 6 month research assistant blind baseline status group assignment . Primary outcome include quality life , mechanisms action confidence enter survivorship , outcome ( 1 ) depression anxiety , ( 2 ) adherence medical behavioral health recommendation , ( 3 ) health care utilization , ( 4 ) patient provider satisfaction POST system.The POST innovate clinical setting first system produce computer generate tailor survivorship plan fully reflect IOM recommendation new ACS 2015 requirement ; incorporate information oncology provider patient ; feature readily available `` plug '' two-way electronic health record integration ; provide dynamic , electronic referral specialize support service ; facilitate care coordination oncologist PCP . This study 's impact significant . If hypothesis confirm , clear scientific evidence exist support survivorship care plan oncology clinical practice .
