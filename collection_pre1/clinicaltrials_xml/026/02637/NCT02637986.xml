Nevertheless , never test pregnant woman . Working hypothesis aim : Administration oral probiotic formula pregnant woman , suffer least one episode UTI , reduce recurrence future UTIs event . Methods : A prospective randomize double blind placebo-control study . Pregnant woman suffer least one event UTI pregnancy divide 2 research arm : ARM A - woman suffer one episode UTI pregnancy recruitment : antibiotic treatment achieve sterile bacterial urine culture , patient divide research group receive probiotic formula Urex Plus contain L. rhamnosus GR-1 L. reuteri RC-14 , control group , receive placebo , twice day delivery . ARM B - woman suffer one episode UTI one episode pyelonephritis pregnancy recruitment receive preventive antibiotic treatment delivery . Similarly ARM A , achieve sterile bacterial urine culture , woman , divide research group , receive probiotic formula Urex Plus , control group , receive placebo twice day delivery . Once month symptom , urine culture take study arm . Vaginal swab test also take detect presence abnormal vaginal flora semi-quantitative assessment vaginal lactobacillus . Data regard rate recurrent UTIs , time infection , average number infection , rate pyelonephritis infection obstetrical neonatal outcome collect .</detailed_description>
