	<brief_summary>Small fiber neuropathy ( SFN ) common cause neuropathic pain peripheral neuropathy , prevalence least 53/100.000 . Patients SFN may excruciate pain current anti-neuropathic pain drug relief pain substantially . Several study suggest immunological basis SFN case study report efficacy treatment intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) patient SFN . It therefore conceivable immunological mechanism play role idiopathic SFN ( I-SFN ) . However , date randomize control study IVIg patient SFN perform . The aim current study investigate efficacy safety IVIg patient I-SFN randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . The objective study evaluate efficacy IVIg treatment ( 4 course treatment , 3 week apart ) compare placebo pain alleviation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Small nerve fiber neuropathy ( SFN ) disorder thinly myelinated unmyelinated nerve fiber recently recognize distinct clinical syndrome , minimum incidence 12 per 100.000 minimum prevalence 53 per 100.000 . The clinical picture typically dominate neuropathic pain , often burn quality , autonomic symptom . The diagnosis SFN usually make basis clinical picture , involvement large nerve fiber neurological examination normal nerve conduction study ( NCS ) , confirm demonstration reduce intra-epidermal nerve fiber density ( IENFD ) abnormal quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) . Despite intensive search underlie cause diabetes mellitus , impair glucose tolerance , Fabry 's disease , hereditary disorder , celiac disease , sarcoidosis , HIV systemic illness may potentially treatable , proportion patient idiopathic SFN ( I-SFN ) remain substantial , range different series 24 % 93 % . It conceivable immunological mechanism play role patient I-SFN , since several immune-mediated disease , sarcoidosis , Sjogren 's disease systemic lupus erythematosis may cause SFN . Auto-antibodies also report patient SFN . Moreover , inflammatory change nerve find . Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine suggest involved pathophysiology pain SFN . In immune-mediated neuropathy , chronic inflammatory demyelinate polyneuropathy , treatment intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) proven efficacious . Moreover , case study patient SFN chronic pain also report effect immunomodulating therapy . Pain reduction IVIg treatment also summarize recently . Intravenous infusion high dos pool immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) molecules thousand donor ( IVIg therapy ) represent efficient anti-inflammatory treatment many autoimmune disease . Paradoxically , IgG exert pro- anti-inflammatory activity , depend upon concentration . When administer high concentration , IVIg anti-inflammatory property . How anti-inflammatory effect mediate yet fully elucidate . Several mutually nonexclusive mechanism propose , include modulation expression function Fc fragment IgG IgG-specific receptor , interference activation complement cascade cytokine network , neutralization autoantibody regulation cell proliferation . However , exact mechanism IVIg treatment inflammatory neuropathy elucidate . Side effect IVIg treatment usually transient ( chill , headache , dizziness , fever , vomit , nausea , arthralgia , low blood pressure moderate low back pain may occur occasionally ) . Sudden fall blood pressure anaphylactic shock rare . More severe side effect extremely rare ( reversible aseptic meningitis , transient cutaneous reaction , reversible haemolytic reaction , haemolytic anemia , thromboembolic event ) . SFN consider common cause neuropathic pain peripheral neuropathy . Patients SFN report excruciate pain , since current anti-neuropathic pain drug relief pain substantially . SFN interfere daily functioning may lead decrement quality life expectation . Therefore , good treatment warrant . The aim current pilot study investigate efficacy safety IVIg patient I-SFN randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study .</detailed_description>
