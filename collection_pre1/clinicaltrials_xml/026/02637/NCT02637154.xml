	<brief_title>Motivational Interview Adolescents With Poorly Controlled Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) patient optimal glycemic control suffer markedly less long term diabetic complication poor control . Increased glycohemoglobin ( HbA1C ) level predict complication risk . The development diabetic complication seem accelerate puberty , poor metabolic control adolescence young adulthood markedly increase incidence micro- macrovascular complication subsequent year . On hand , intensive treatment adolescence report reduce risk microvascular complication , even control later becomes poor . This implicate intervention target improved glycemic control adolescence probably sustain beneficial effect overall morbidity patient T1D . The glycemic control Finnish adolescent T1D poor . Insulin resistance impair metabolic control common problem . Treatment disease puberty complicate particularly treatment adherence often decline youth . Inexpensive easily adoptable method clinician need overcome treatment problem face adolescent patient . At present , generally recommended approach clinician apply order motivate adolescent poor glycemic control towards well treatment adherence . To end , motivational interviewing ( MI ) use increase degree health care professional treatment variety disorder behavioral problem , alcohol drug problem , gamble , cardiovascular disease . Motivational interview counsel approach design facilitate intrinsic motivation patient change behavior . Significant body evidence support view MI improve commitment care add treatment . However , study evaluate MI treatment adolescent diabetes patient , outcome range substantial benefit neutral . MI promising approach treatment adolescent type 1 diabetic clear demand methodologically solid study . Aims The aim present study investigate effect motivational interviewing intensive education HbA1c value glucose variability poorly control adolescent T1D patient . Secondarily , investigate whether improved glycemic control associate improvement vascular parameter , metabolic marker , marker bone health health relate quality life . Hypothesis In present study motivational interviewing ( MI ) integrate clinician ' daily practice , part normal clinical visit . In randomized , controlled trial hypothesis , apply motivational interviewing regular clinical visit result good acceptance subsequently enhance metabolic control adolescent poorly control type 1 diabetes . Study protocol All physician participate study train use standardize educational ( SE ) material . In addition half physician randomize motivational interview ( MI ) group . They train professor Martti Tuomisto 's group use MI one day workshop refresher practical rehearsal course prior study start . To secure MI sufficiently apply , physician/patient discussion monitor Tuomisto group . All researcher randomize MI group receive continuous feedback Tuomisto group performance ( i.e . level apply MI ) need re-trained MI . Patients Hba1c &gt; 75 mmol/mol identify hospital record , consider eligible current study . The patient willing participate randomize either MI plus SE SE group . Study Protocol Every visit include physical examination ( include evaluation stage puberty testis volume start 12 month ) , measurement height , weight , growth velocity , body mass index ( BMI ) , blood pressure waist circumference , usage SE material , MI group usage MI patient visit . The intervention MI group consist MI type introduction begin patient visit , apply MI principle procedures educational item discuss patient visit . Adherence MI intervention protocol check use record sample therapy interaction . HbA1c level also measure every visit . Six day blind continuous glucose monitoring perform baseline follow-up ( 0 , 6 12 month ) . Fasting venous blood sample obtain baseline 12 month . Investigators evaluate health relate quality life ( QoL ) study participant baseline , completion study . Dual- energy x-absorptiometry ( DXA ) perform baseline 12 month . Vascular assessment perform baseline study completion .</detailed_description>
