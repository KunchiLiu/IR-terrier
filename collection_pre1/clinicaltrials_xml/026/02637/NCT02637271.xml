	<brief_summary>In order well understand commonly use dietary intervention obesity influence brain activity turn people 's ability adhere healthy nutrition plan , investigator need study people 's brain react food cue undergoing intervention . Our study add understanding neural ( brain ) regulation hedonic homeostatic mechanism ( i.e . pleasure hunger ) influence adherence calorie-reduced eating plan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment subject : Advertisements recruitment participant post social medium notice board within Texas Tech University ( TTU ) include web-based notice board ( include limit Tech Announce , Craig 's List ) . Announcements also make use material target local community pay advertisement local print online medium outlet ( e.g . newspaper ) flyer distribute within area medical clinic fitness center . Thirty-two obese ( BMI &gt; 30 ) male female subject enrol intended completion least 30 ( 15 per group ) . Pre-Screening ( Telephone ) : Individuals express interest participating contact graduate undergraduate research assistant administer structure telephone interview : 1 ) provide information related requirement study , along potential risk benefit 2 ) Screen eligibility base specific inclusion exclusion criterion . All potential subject inform response remain confidential take part screen interview way obligate participate . Potential participant meet participation criterion assess via telephone prescreening process contact study team via email/phone within 48 hour follow interview inform eligibility ( ineligibility ) schedule initial , person assessment ( Visit 1 ) deem eligible . Visit 1 ( Screening Consent ) : This in-person screening visit include follow : Participants provide Behavioral Medicine Translational Research ( BMTR ) Health &amp; Weight History Form complete upon arrival clinic . Weight , height , BMI body fat percentage via bio-electrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) use TANITA BC-418 segmental body composition analyzer ( TANITA Corporation America Inc. , IL , USA ) body composition analysis unit ; measure blood pressure ( BP ) via Omron Digital BP Monitor HEM-907XL ( Omron Healthcare Inc. , IL , USA ) obtain . If inclusion/exclusion criterion meet ; inform consent obtain participant consider 'enrolled ' study time . Participants schedule 2 scan visit ( visit 2 5 ) 2 check visit ( visit 3 4 ) time instructed procedure subsequent visit . At completion Visit 1 participant tell make deviation standard diet initial fMRI scan visit ( visit 2 ) . Special Scheduling Considerations : The phase menstrual cycle may effect craving . The first scanning session pre-menopausal female participant schedule second half follicular phase menstrual cycle ( i.e . 10th - 14th day menstrual cycle ) . Thus , second scanning session , perform 3 week first session , perform first half follicular phase ( approximately 3rd 7th day ) next menstrual cycle . This ensure scan session perform within follicular phase . Visit 2 ( Pre-intervention fMRI Scan ) : 1 . Participants request refrain take item food beverage ( except water ) 8 hour minimum prior scanner visit . 2 . The participant also advise refrain ) tobacco use form ii ) intake alcohol caffeine form within 24 hour prior scan visit . 3 . The participant ask complete follow paper &amp; pencil measure adjacent room prior enter fMRI scanner : ) Food Craving Inventory ; ii ) Power Food Scale ; iii ) Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire ; iv ) Yale Food Addiction Scale ; v ) Visual Analogue Scales ( VAS ) dimension hunger , satiety , thirst , fullness emptiness . 4 . The duration scan 45-60 minute ( include time spend place participant scanner ) . 5 . After scan complete , participant take adjacent room VAS administer immediately scan ( total duration 30 minute ) accord procedure outline ( c ) . 6 . The participant show laptop computer , random subset 60 image set participant expose , fMRI scan paradigm , randomly mixed 60 image participant expose task recognizing image present scan paradigm ( duration 15-20 minute ) . fMRI scan paradigm : An event-related design use stimulus presentation . 120 image two category ( food item object ) display LCD screen project via mirror attach head coil . Images food object match contrast , brightness , size resolution . Food image represent continuous spectrum highly reward less rewarding item , select common object ( e.g . paper clip ) deem 'neutral ' . Each participant show fixation cross last 2000-4000ms . Then , visual image present 5000-6000ms 'overlapped ' opportunity rating stimulus subject ( i.e. , rating perform view image ) . During presentation image , participant require answer question `` How much want ? '' 1-7 Likert scale use fiber optic button . This sequence conduct 30 time , different image complete run . Eight run comprise scan session . Following stimulus presentation phase ( EPI scan ) , T1-weighted structural scan ( SS ) last approximately 5 minute obtain followed diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) scan ( 6 minute ) assess white-matter connectivity . Immediately follow initial fMRI scan subject randomly assign one 2 arm study : Total Meal Replacement ( TMR ) group Typical Diet ( TD ) group ( 16 participant per group ) . Each arm maintain 1120 kcal/day target caloric intake . TMR Group : Optifastâ„¢ 800 total meal replacement shake ( 1120 kcal/day ) provide nutrition ( additional food ) . One week supply meal replacement product provide . TD Group : Participants direct use portion control maintain calorie level 1120 kcal per day . Subjects provide resource assist determine caloric content food eaten . Visits 3 4 ( Check-in Visits ) : Subjects group request return BMTR lab 1 week interval first 2 week follow visit 2 weigh , blood pressure take , review issue report adherence variation protocol ( include additional caloric intake ) . Subjects TMR group receive next week 's product visit . Subjects TD group request provide write list daily calorie intake past week visit . Visit 5 ( post-intervention Scanning Visit ) : Preparation visit , completion pencil paper measure , procedure scan post-scan memory task similar visit 2 . In addition , BIA , BP , weight height measure BMI calculate . Analysis : fMRI analysis carry use standard mixed effect model implement FMRIB Software Library ( FSL ) . Specifically , analysis fMRI data focus identify pre-post difference location relative magnitude whole brain activation pattern within member group ( TMR vs. TD ) . Pre-planned comparison also make specific region interest : ) food-reward related area ( e.g . insula , orbito-frontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex , amygdala ) ; b ) reward calculate region ( e.g . nucleus accumbens ventral striatum ) , c ) memory emotion relate area ( e.g . hippocampus amygdala ) ; ) homeostatic circuitry ( i.e . hypothalamus ) cortical area exert executive control ( e.g . pre-frontal cortex ) . Both structural functional connectivity consider region interest also model compare within group . Demographic , health , weight history psychosocial variable may include covariates specific analysis indicate .</detailed_description>
