	<brief_summary>The purpose DACAPO study ( `` Surviving ARDS : influence quality care individual patient characteristic quality life '' ) investigate role quality care individual patient characteristic quality life return work survivor ARDS ( acute respiratory distress syndrome ) . It hypothesize high quality care associate well health-related quality life high rate return work among survivor . A prospective , observational , multi-centre patient cohort study perform Germany , use hospital `` ARDS Network Germany '' main recruiting centre . It envisage recruit 2400 patient DACAPO study analyze study population 1500 survivor . They follow 12 month discharge hospital . Quality care assess process quality , structural quality volume institutional level . The main outcome ( health relate quality life return work ) gather self-report questionnaire . Further data assessment include general medical ARDS-related characteristic patient well sociodemographic psycho-social parameter . Multilevel hierarchical modelling perform analyse effect quality care individual patient characteristic outcome , take cluster structure data account .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Patients include study begin ICU stay participate hospital ( t0 ) survivor follow period 12 month discharge ICU . If patient treat refer hospital , retrospective assessment health status stay hospital inter-hospital transport perform . Four follow-up measurement ( discharge ICU well 3 , 6 12 month discharge ) perform individual patient level . Sample &amp; Recruitment Hospitals `` ARDS Network Germany '' hospital provide care patient ARDS invite participate study . It envisage screen 2600 patient presence ARDS include 2400 patient member source population . An in-hospital mortality rate 30 % assume ; therefore , expect analyze study population 1500 patient t1 ( discharge ICU ) . For follow-up-assessment ( t2-t4 : 3 month , 6 month , 12 month discharge ) , loss-to-follow-up rate due death , withdrawal consent reason estimate 10 % , result slightly 1000 patient 12-months-follow-up . Measurements The main predictor quality care provide ICUs participate hospital . The following main indicator choose : qualification physician , implementation routine daily multiprofessional ward round documentation daily therapy goal , number ventilate patient per , membership hospital `` ARDS Network Germany '' . All quality indicator assess questionnaire institutional level . Main outcome measure DACAPO study HRQoL return work among survivor ARDS ( see study outcomes ) . Moderating variable gender , socio-economic status , prevalent incident psychopathological symptom ( PHQ-D , PTSS-14 ) availability social support ( F-SozU K-14 ) . Additional variable comprise general medical ICU parameter ( e.g . comorbidity , prognostic score ( SAPS ( Simplified Acute Physiology Score ) II , SAPS III ) organ dysfunction score ( SOFA ( Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ) ) parameter relate ARDS ( e.g . cause severity ) treatment ( e.g . ventilation parameter , use supportive care measure , critical event ( hypoglycaemia , hypoxia ) ) well socio-demographic psycho-social characteristic . Additionally , cost assess direct cost term treatment cost ICU . Data Sources Data Collection Patients 's general medical characteristic medical data relate ARDS treatment assess ICU stay gather electronic case report form ( eCRFs ) . Data direct cost treat patient ARDS ICU gather hospital record . A 12-months mortality follow-up perform . Local municipal population registry contact obtain data mortality patient level . At baseline , caregiver provide proxy report patient ' socio-demographic data , follow-up ( discharge ICU , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month ) , patient complete self-report questionnaire socio-demographic psycho-social characteristic well main outcome measure . Data indicator quality care assess questionnaire administer director hospitals/ICUs . Data Management The open source software OpenClinica , version 3.1 , use electronic data collection data management . eCRFs use data entry . A continuous assessment data quality perform export data set statistical package run error plausibility check . Data paper-pencil-questionnaires complete patient enter database twice order ensure high data quality . Statistical Analysis A linear multilevel regression model fit physical mental component summary score SF-12 . A non-parametric multilevel regression model use outcome `` return work '' . The modelling procedure apply operationalizations predictor `` quality care '' . All analysis carry use SAS 9.4 software STATA version 12 software .</detailed_description>
