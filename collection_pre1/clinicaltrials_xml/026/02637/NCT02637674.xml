	<brief_title>Uterine Allotransplantations Using Uterine Grafts From Brain-dead Female Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 1 500 woman reproductive age congenital acquire uterine factor infertility ( UFI ) . The solution patient wish child either adopt use surrogate . The latter illegal France .Uterine transplantation ( UT ) could beneficial medical alternative . Over last 13 year , 30 experimental study conduct rodent , rabbit , pig , sheep monkey . They show TU feasible , number birth achieve uterus auto-transplantation , syngeneic transplantation allotransplantation . However , animal experiment able provide definitive answer question feasibility UT woman due specific characteristic specie low degree control immunosuppression vitro fertilisation technique animal . Thus , information animal experiment present knowledge immunosuppression woman , base experiment solid organ transplantation , explain willingness take step undergo clinical UT . The recent human data first births UT obtain Swedish team reassure confirm feasibility procedure . The data gather 50 year pregnancies patient receive kidney , liver heart transplant reassure , 20,000 birth record recommendation start pregnancy , patient follow-up immunosuppressive drug ( ISD ) handle currently relatively well-established . As compare solid organ transplantation , UT particular temporary ( graft remove child bear case safety issue ) period exposure immunosuppressant thus reduce . Our team recognise experience field female fertility preservation ovarian grafting . Work begin animal end 1990s lead first pregnancy France ovarian autograft 2010 . With regard uterus grafting , investigator publish work uterine allotransplantation involve ewes evaluation graft magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Clinically , investigator begin work cadaver conduct study 2012-2013 , support French Biomedical Agency ( Agence de la biomédecine ) , feasibility uterus retrieve part multi-organ retrieval ( MOR ) procedure . In preliminary clinical study , investigator able show technique uterus retrieval brain-dead donor reproduce . Acceptance retrieval relative brain-dead patient good ( refusal ) . In present protocol , investigator propose pilot study UT woman graft brain-dead female donor . In human , UT envisage graft either live deceased donor . In Turkey , UT brain-dead donor , performed 2011 , first achieve pregnancy . This pregnancy , unfortunately , non-progressive . In Sweden , team Prof. Brannström perform nine UTs 2012 2013 living donor . One donor suffer utero-vaginal fistula , thus confirm potential surgical risk procedure live donor . Conversely , recipient , success rate UT six month 78 % ( seven successful transplantation , menstrual period occur first six month , nine transplantation perform ) . Unlike Swedish team , investigator plan use graft brain-dead donor order avoid potential surgical risk alive donor . In addition , accord French Biomedical Agency , around 220 brain-dead female donor 50 year year France . The recipient select accord inclusion criterion . They ask promise live close Limoges University Hospital 3 month post uterus transplantation . Inclusion confirm none primary , secondary tertiary exclusion criterion present least 10 embryo obtain via IVF conduct Limoges University Hospital . The patient register transplant wait list . Since aim project perform eight UTs , patient sign consent form replace secondarily exclude wish withdraw study . The uterine retrieval perform surgical team Limoges University Hospital four retrieval centre central-western part France . Uterine transplantation perform Limoges University Hospital vascular gynaecological surgery team . Patients monitor jointly gynaecology , renal transplantation psychiatric team . The immunosuppressive treatment include induction ( anti-CD25 antibody ) , tacrolimus , antimetabolite ( mycophenolate mofetil follow azathioprine pregnancy ) initial corticotherapy . The graft monitor imaging ( MRI , ultrasound ) , biopsy cervix therapeutic drug monitoring . Rejection determine accord criterion Johannesson . The success transplantation confirm occurrence menstrual period first year . In successful case , embryo transfer begin second year transplantation . In absence successful pregnancy , transfer attempt continue month available embryo leave , maximum period 18 month . The embryo use manage accordance French law bioethics . The patient receive close multidisciplinary follow-up throughout pregnancy . The delivery do caesarean section . The graft explanted immediately follow caesarean possible 2 month post partum . If UT fail ( menstrual period one year ) , graft explanted . The graft also explanted follow situation : uterine necrosis , corticoresistant rejection , serious adverse effect attributable immunosuppressive drug , severe infectious complication , haemorrhagic complication , absence progressive pregnancy maximum period 18 month embryo transfer attempt , separation couple . The child receive follow-up paediatrician accordance common practice . All live attenuate vaccine contraindicate first six month follow birth .</detailed_description>
