	<brief_title>Comparison VT Ablation Outcomes Using Remote MAGNETIC Navigation Versus Manual Approach Low LVEF Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , single-blind , prospective , multi-center post market evaluation . Subjects screen study eligibility ask complete write informed consent prior study specific test assessment . After complete write informed consent , total 382 subject randomize 1:1 basis receive VT ablation treatment use either Niobe ES standard manual catheter ablation treatment use commercially available product . This large randomized VT study compare outcome RMN manually guide catheter ablation procedure . Subjects randomize accord computer-generated randomization scheme . Randomization block study site level subject blind group assignment . Since quality life measurement collect follow-up , study single-blinded order mitigate patient bias . Clinical evaluation mask treat physician .</detailed_description>
