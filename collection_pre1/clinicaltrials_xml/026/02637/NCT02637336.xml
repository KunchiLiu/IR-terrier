	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate acute cardiovascular response hypertensive individual , wake sleep period application different non-pharmacological therapy control blood pressure ( BP ) . Randomly random volunteer hold session therapy : Acupuncture , aerobic exercise , essential oil inhalation , session control minimum interval 72 hour . On day session volunteer use antihypertensive medication . The variable measure survey blood pressure heart rate variability ( HRV ) . Descriptive statistical averaging procedure , standard deviation standard error mean adopt . Two-way ANOVA repeat measure perform post-hoc Tukey . The level study significance set p &lt; 0.05 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study deal control trial randomize crossover , intentional non-probabilistic sample . All participant inform procedure adopt research , sign Informed Consent Informed ( IC ) accord resolution 466/12 National Health Council ( Annex 1 ) . The initial recruitment volunteer hold October 2014 initial assessment carry month , project approve Ethics Committee Ethics Studies Research Federal University São Francisco Valley registration number 0010 / 240914 CEDEP / UNIVASF , data collection volunteer complete July 2015 . The plant material Eucalyptus globulus collect January May 2015 city Petrolina , Pernambuco state , Brazil . The process extraction essential oil eucalyptus , make hydrodistillation method Clevenger system . To set number survey participant conduct sample calculation G.Power 3.0 program F test choose - two-way ANOVA repeat measure group within group . Whereas four ( 04 ) experimental session eighteen ( 18 ) measure time session , well α = 0.05 power = 0.80 , sample size 12 subject require . Participants randomly recruit health center city Petrolina / PE disclosure / meeting present research project , addition collaboration health worker surround neighborhood UNIVASF . All participant divide block accordance CONSORT criterion . Initially , research project , along IC , present candidate volunteer , discussion risk benefit , scientific individual would likely compose study sample . After agree participation , application history health history , readiness exercise risk stratification accord guideline American College Sports Medicine , inform consent sign , schedule volunteer day time completion rest ECG examination ( hold large hospital Petrolina / PE fund researcher ) , check possible abnormality ischemia suggestion unevenness ST segment &gt; 2 mm inversion T wave . All ECG 's 12-lead performed evaluate cardiologist , examination apesentou suggestion ischemia abnormality would prevent volunteer carry stage safely search . After meet selection sample accordance guideline inclusion profile , participant invite attend morning CEFIS UNIVASF carry anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , body mass index , waist circumference body fat percentage ) , schedule start experimental session . Volunteers orientation suspend anti-hypertensive medication day session , return use removal equipment ( next day ) researcher . In addition recommendation , volunteer eat day intervention , substance contain caffeine , alcohol , chocolate , tea , passion fruit stimulant CNS retardant , eat routine follow . The practice physical activity , include sexual , ban day apply session . On different day , interval least 72 hour , randomize order , acupuncture , aerobic exercise , inhalation essential oil eucalyptus , control apply . In order minimize influence circadian rhythm , session always make time day ( 8 9 ) . Each treatment last twenty ( 20 ) minute . The live laboratory procedure control temperature 23 ° C 24 ° C session . The acupuncture session ( ACUP ) place , maintain 20 minute perpendicularly skin , two specific needle , stainless steel , sterilize disposable ( one arm ) 0.25mm brand Dongbang x 0.30 mm , Section 6 pericardium channel ( Neiguan ) , locate 2 tsun ( approximately 5 cm ) proximal crease wrist , ventral aspect . The aerobic exercise session ( EXER ) conduct 20-minute walk jog treadmill CEFISE brand , model TK30 ( Campinas , BRA ) . The intensity equivalent 60 % RHR ( maximal HR - rest HR x 0.6 + HR rest ) . In session eucalyptus essential oil ( OIL ) subject sit , rest time , remain breathe naturally 20 minute disposable face mask , soak 0.25 ml essential oil eucalyptus measure Adjustable Pipettor Kacil DSA ® Model 100 / 1000μl . The session control ( CONT ) volunteer remain seated stand 20 minute manner chair used acupuncture inhalation essential oil , without perform treatment . The BP assess ABPM device brand Meditech ABPM-04 ( Micromed , BRA ) . The content BP analyze study : systolic BP ( SBP ) ; Diastolic BP ( DBP ) ; BP Average ( PAM ) , follow : MAP = DAP + [ ( PAS-DAP ) / 3 ] ; Pressure overload ( percentage &gt; 125/75 mmHg 24 hour ; &gt; 130 / 85mmHg Vigil &gt; 110/70 Sleep , respectively SBP DBP ) ; Night decline ( relative percentage difference average sleep BP BP wake average ) . The measurement take every 15 minute daytime every 30 minute sleep . HRV analyze record RRi interval obtain heart rate monitor brand Polar RS800CX model ( Polar Electro Oy , FI-90440 KEMPELE , Finland ) validate equipment high reproducibility . The HRV index analyze linear method time domain ( RRi , RMSSD , pNN50 ) frequency ( LF , HF LF : HF ) , non-linear method standard deviation RRI interval ( SD1 ) . Records RRi series capture recorded watch belonging equipment , continuously throughout period day session , analyze use software Kubios v. 2.0 interval 5 minute . Descriptive statistical averaging procedure , standard deviation ( SD ) standard error mean ( SEM ) adopt . Shapiro-Wilk test normality analysis use , case normality give two-way ANOVA repeat measure perform post-hoc Tukey . For non-parametric data use nonparametric ANOVA analysis . The level study significance set p &lt; 0.05 , use Statistica software version 7.0 .</detailed_description>
