	<brief_summary>The purpose present study compare immunological response pneumococcal serotype specific B-cells , humoral immune response safety sequential vaccination versus simultaneous vaccination 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV13 ) 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV23 ) versus single vaccination PPV23 prospective , randomize control monocentric head-to head clinical study elderly . The hypothesis study simultaneous vaccination PCV13 PPV23 might achieve improve immune-response compare sequential vaccination single vaccination . Adults &gt; =60 year without previous pneumococcal vaccination randomize three group receive either PCV13 day 0 plus PPV23 6 month later ( sequential vaccination ) receive PCV13 plus PPV23 simultaneous day 0 ( simultaneous vaccination ) receive PPV23 day 0 ( single vaccination ) . Blood take pneumococcal serotype-specific B-memory cell four vaccine-serotypes ( ST ) , include PCV13 PPV23 , vaccine-serotype 3 ( ST3 ) , vaccine-serotype 14 ( ST14 ) , vaccine-serotype 19A ( ST19A ) vaccine-serotype 23F ( ST23F ) visit 1 , 2,4,5,7 8 antibody level 12 vaccine-serotypes include PCV13 PPV23 visit 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 8 three group . Adverse event record 28 day vaccination .</brief_summary>
