	<brief_title>Does Plasma Reduce Bleeding Patients Undergoing Invasive Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fresh frozen plasma use frequently US . Many plasma transfusion give prior procedure order correct perceive bleeding risk , yet little evidence support use plasma reduces bleed . There never adequately powered trial establish efficacy plasma document risk . This pilot study evaluate feasibility conduct research protocol lead large scale clinical trial design evaluate treatment effectiveness prophylactic plasma transfusion patient moderately elevate INRs prior undergo invasive procedure outside operating room . Study subject randomly allocate either receive either plasma transfusion prior procedure , treatment . Study outcomes compare two study arm . Recruitment rate , protocol adherence , rate study outcome assess determine feasibility large scale trial .</detailed_description>
