	<brief_summary>Stroke third common cause mortality lead cause long term disability worldwide 900,000 people live England stroke . 75 % survivor regain ability walk , however estimate 55 75 % fail regain satisfactory use impaired arm . This limit person 's independence , ability care reduce quality life . Research indicate optimal recovery , high level rehabilitation require yet current provision often fail meet required level intensity duration therapy . In conjunction stroke patient , family therapist , team develop low cost system ( virtual glove ) encourage stroke survivor practice arm exercise home . The system track infrared light emit diode ( LEDs ) position finger turn hand game controller play game encourage movement reach , grasp release underlie activity daily live . Before examine effectiveness , purpose register study determine feasible large trial would term whether sufficient participant could recruit , whether would use glove whether outcome measure could collect . Patients recruit aged 18 year , recover stroke , longer receive intensive rehabilitation still experience difficulty use arm . After baseline measure collect randomly allocate either intervention group control group . The intervention group virtual glove game home period eight week advise use equipment 20 minute , three time day . The control group continue whatever care already receive new intervention . Outcome measure collect baseline , four week equipment remove home . Outcome measure include test arm function well participant report often use affected arm easy find activity daily live . The therapist collect outcome measure know group participant allocate . Once outcome measure collect two group compare much final outcome measure differ collect baseline .</brief_summary>
