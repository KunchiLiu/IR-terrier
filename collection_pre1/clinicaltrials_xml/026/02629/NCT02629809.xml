	<brief_title>First-line Therapy With Ibrutinib , Fludarabine , Cyclophosphamide , Obinutuzumab ( GA-101 ) ( iFCG ) Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 4 week ( 28 day ) . If find eligible take part study , receive study drug combination follow schedule Cycles 1-3 : You receive obinutuzumab vein 4-6 hour follow day : - Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 15 Cycle 1 - Day 1 Cycles 2-3 You receive fludarabine vein 15 minute follow day : - Days 2-4 Cycle 1 - Days 1-3 Cycles 2-3 You receive cyclophosphamide vein 30 minute follow day : - Days 2-4 Cycle 1 - Days 1-3 Cycles 2-3 You also take ibrutinib mouth 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water every day Cycles 1-3 . You swallow capsule whole . Do break , crush , chew , dissolve capsule . If miss dose , take miss dose soon possible day return normal dose time next day . Do take extra ibrutinib make miss dose . If unable complete 3 cycle treatment obinutuzumab , fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , ibrutinib , able receive obinutuzumab ibrutinib . You also receive follow drug low risk side effect : - You take allopurinol mouth 1 time day Days 1-7 Cycle 1 . - You take valacyclovir mouth every day take ibrutinib least 3 month last dose . You also give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . You continue take study drug Cycle 3 schedule base status disease : - If end Cycle 3 result bone marrow biopsy/aspirate show disease respond completely , receive obinutuzumab ibrutinib schedule describe Cycles 4-6 . If end Cycle 6 still evidence disease , take ibrutinib alone Cycles 7-12 . If end Cycle 6 evidence disease , receive obinutuzumab ibrutinib Cycles 7-12 . If end Cycle 12 disease appear respond completely , receive treatment . If end Cycle 12 still evidence disease , receive ibrutinib alone long doctor think best interest . - If end Cycle 3 result bone marrow biopsy/aspirate show evidence disease , receive obinutuzumab ibrutinib schedule describe Cycles 4-12 . If end Cycle 12 still evidence disease , receive ibrutinib alone long doctor think best interest . If end Cycle 12 disease appear respond completely , receive treatment . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . You may additional blood draw Cycle 1 doctor think need . During Cycle 2 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test least every 2 week . During Cycle 3 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test every 2 week . - You EKG check heart function . - You bone marrow aspirate biopsy check status disease . - You CT PET scan contrast neck ( need ) , chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . During Cycles 4-12 : - You physical exam 1 time cycle . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test least 1 time every cycle . - You bone marrow aspirate biopsy check status disease every 3 cycle . - You CT PET scan contrast neck ( need ) , chest , abdomen , pelvis every 3 cycle . During Cycles 13 beyond ( long continue take ibrutinib ) : - You physical exam every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate biopsy check status disease every 6 month . - If doctor think need , CT PET scan contrast neck ( need ) , chest , abdomen , pelvis every 6 month . Physical exam blood draw may do often doctor think need . Length Treatment : You may continue receive ibrutinib long study doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . No additional follow-up require last dose study drug beyond normal study visit . This investigational study . Ibrutinib , fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , obinutuzumab FDA approve commercially available treatment patient CLL . The use drug combination investigational . The study doctor explain drug design work . Up 45 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
