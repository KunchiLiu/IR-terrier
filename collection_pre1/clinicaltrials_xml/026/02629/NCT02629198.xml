	<brief_summary>There current interest role vitamin D prevention treatment many chronic disease , include osteoporosis , cancer neurological disease . The majority vitamin D UK come action sunlight skin , little dietary source . Half adult United Kingdom ( UK ) population vitamin D insufficiency ( accord Institute Medicine definition ) . There still several important unknown , include optimum level vitamin D , whether intake vitamin D appropriate section population . Low 25 ( OH ) D high parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) observe people high adiposity ( obesity ) , summer rise vitamin D blunt obesity . The potential cause low 25 ( OH ) D level include inadequate supply vitamin D ( reduce sunlight exposure poor nutrition ) , large pool size adipose tissue increase metabolic clearance rate . The investigator measure metabolites vitamin D kinetics 25 ( OH ) D use stable isotope technique lean , overweight obese men , woman child establish whether age , gender obesity affect vitamin D metabolism clearance rate . If low 25 ( OH ) D obesity relate poor skeletal health due increase clearance 25 ( OH ) D large pool size , total requirement , hence supplementation requirement , would large obese people lean people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part 1 : Measurement vitamin D metabolites ( adults child ) Circulating level vitamin D metabolite influence calcium intake , participant ask complete seven day diet diary first vitamin D measurement . Measured vitamin D influence vitamin D binding protein , lipids inflammatory cytokine , investigator include correct measurement . Visit 1 Consent Height weight Diet diary instruction Urine collection instruction Visit 2 Return 24h urine collection calcium creatinine Return diet diary Fasting blood sample vitamin D , bind protein metabolite C reactive protein ( CRP ) , lipids creatine kinase ( CK ) , PTH , insulin-like growth factor -1 ( IGF-1 ) , creatinine , calcium , albumin , phosphate Part 2 : Measurement vitamin D clearance rate ( adult ) Kinetic study perturb acute change vitamin D ( likely cause sunlight exposure sunny day ) , study conduct autumn , winter , early spring sunlight Sheffield strong enough deliver large dos vitamin D. The administration sample protocol kinetics study develop statistician Sheffield School Health Related Research ( ScHaRR ) collaboration Medical Research Council Human Nutrition Unit , base model previous use stable isotope tracer method . Visit 2 Oral administration stable vitamin D isotope Visit 3 ( 5-7 day visit 2 ) Blood sample tracer vitamin D metabolites Visit 4 ( 9 day ± 2 visit 2 ) Blood sample tracer vitamin D metabolites Visit 5 ( 27 day ± 2 visit 2 ) Blood sample tracer vitamin D metabolites Visit 6 ( 30 day ± 2 visit 2 ) Blood sample tracer vitamin D metabolites Height weight The effect obesity vitamin D metabolite determine regression model BMI vitamin D measurement correct age gender . The effect obesity vitamin D kinetics determine model metabolic clearance rate age , gender BMI . Subjects ' previous data 'Effects obesity bone structure strength'study ( STH 15688 ) 'Body weight bone ' study ( STH16199 ) use evaluate relationship vitamin D metabolism body fat distribution , bone density structure , bone biochemistry .</detailed_description>
