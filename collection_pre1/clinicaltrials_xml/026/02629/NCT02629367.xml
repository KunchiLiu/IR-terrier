	<brief_summary>Currently , data available regard effect vorapaxar clot generation kinetics TIP-FCS add standard care antiplatelet regimen . Potential reduction TIP-FCS clot generation kinetics vorapaxar may assist understand mechanism action personalize therapy high risk patient effectively reduce recurrent thrombotic event occurrence . The objective study determine onset- , maintenance- , offset-effect vorapaxar platelet-fibrin clot generation kinetics thrombelastography ( R , TIP-FCS , TG ) thrombin generation kinetics ( Lag time , peak thrombin production , time peak thrombin generation , endogenous thrombin potential ) antiplatelet na√Øve patient patient mono dual antiplatelet therapy . This phase IV , prospective cohort ( 4 group ) , non-randomized , open label , pharmacodynamics , safety investigation .</brief_summary>
