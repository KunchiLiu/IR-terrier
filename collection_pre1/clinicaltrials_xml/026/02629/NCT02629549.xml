	<detailed_description>Pituitary adenoma estimate prevalence population approximately 10 % , although predominantly benign tumor , cause significant disability mass effect ( visual field deficit cranial nerve deficit ) hypersecretory syndrome ( Cushing 's disease , acromegaly , hyperprolactinemia ) . Approximately 30 % pituitary adenoma nonfunctioning endocrinologically silent , despite lack hormonal overexpression represent great majority patient undergo surgery give threat apoplexy compression adjacent neural structure . Surgical resection via transsphenoidal surgery remain primary treatment modality almost pituitary adenoma except prolactinomas . Residual tumor , however , quite common surgical resection see 20 % surgical case . By ensure negative margin image surgery , would possible minimize need postoperative radiation therapy and/or radiosurgery subsequent surgery well . Gross total resection ( GTR ) pituitary adenoma theoretically simple practically difficult give intimate association pituitary gland critical neurovascular structure include internal carotid artery , optic nerve , cavernous sinus content adjacent frontal lobe third ventricle . In recent meta-analysis , function pituitary adenoma ( Cushing 's disease , prolactinoma , acromegaly ) demonstrate gross total resection rate 78 % ( n=664 ) . In another review , tabulate multiple study , demonstrate nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma , gross total resection rate range 66 93 % ( n=778 ) . Moreover , comparison endoscopic microscopic removal pituitary adenoma find gross total resection rate 66 % use endoscopic pituitary technique . In context limited ability achieve GTR , intraoperative MRI introduce assessment degree resection pituitary adenoma . The intraoperative MRI expensive , cumbersome , impractical . A simpler mean determine degree resection greatly need field brain surgery , specifically pituitary surgery . Pituitary adenomas ideal disease investigate intra-operative imaging . Multiple study demonstrate nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma express folate receptor alpha ( FRα ) , therefore make folate receptor ( FR ) ideal target image agent . While folate initially distribute cell , redistribution , metabolism , excretion eliminate agent healthy tissue within 2-3 hour . Tumor cell express FRα retain folate fluorescent label folate conjugate ( OTL38 ) internalize .</detailed_description>
