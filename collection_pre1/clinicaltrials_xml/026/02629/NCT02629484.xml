	<brief_summary>Hip fracture surgery major world health care burden concern , large increase prevalence carry high patient mortality , disability community health care cost . As commonest cause mortality cardiac complication , cardiac disease prevalent frequently miss standard care , hypothesise earlier accurate diagnosis treatment cardiac pathology cohort lead improve outcome . Focused cardiac ultrasound ( FCU ) new increasingly popular technique use doctor enable early accurate diagnosis cardiac disorder perform routinely hip fracture surgery . Our preliminary data 64 patient demonstrated routine FCU surgery lead change cardiac diagnosis management 50 % patient require hip fracture surgery , associate 50 % reduction mortality 12 month surgery compare control . It therefore important large randomise trial perform confirm rebuke finding , true , would large impact health care may also improve health care outcome high-risk surgical population . The propose pilot study pilot study aim establish feasibility , safety , compliance group separation prior commence definitive multicentre trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Focused Cardiac Ultrasound Fractured Neck Femur Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims Hypotheses Aims 1 . To determine whether routine preoperative focus cardiac ultrasound ( FCU ) lead reduced composite outcome death , major adverse cardiac event , acute renal failure ( adverse composite outcome ) 30 day hip fracture surgery compare patient receive preoperative FCU ( current standard care ) . 2 . To identify change team management patient due FCU associate improved outcome , compare current standard care . 3 . To determine whether routine preoperative FCU cost-effective current standard care . Hypotheses 1 . FCU reduce adverse composite outcome least 20 % , 30 day hip fracture surgery . 2 . FCU lead change cardiac diagnosis , subsequent change perioperative post-discharge management plan , associate improve outcome compare current standard care . 3 . Routine FCU hip fracture surgery cost-effective current standard care . Identifying cardiovascular disease : Preoperative cardiac assessment , enable improved cardiac treatment reduction cardiac complication , recommend American Heart Association . However , cardiovascular disease often unrecognised under-diagnosed age group frailty , general immobility , high frequency poor cognitive function include dementia , inhibits accurate clinical assessment . Careful cardiac assessment treatment often undertaken belief surgery perform urgently delay cardiac investigation may worsen outcome . Cardiac risk factor death hip fracture surgery ( cardiac failure , aortic stenosis , pulmonary hypertension right ventricular hypertrophy ) reliably diagnose clinical examination require echocardiography ( FCU transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) ) . Although pulmonary embolus reliably diagnose echocardiography , haemodynamic effect significant pulmonary embolus readily see ( right ventricular dilatation failure ) . Currently , preoperative TTE use select patient , base clinical assessment opinion clinician whether justified . If anaesthetist review patient prior surgery concern cardiovascular disease , lot pressure proceed book surgery due current belief early surgery save life , rather delay surgery TTE . Treatment therefore often base `` best guess '' clinical assessment . This management approach may lead inadequate treatment resultant hypotension , lead organ failure death . Focused Cardiac Ultrasound ( FCU ) : The conventional TTE investigation order treat doctor , perform technician report cardiologist radiologist late time . The TTE provide detailed information structure function valves chamber also refer diagnostic echocardiography . A TTE complex cardiovascular investigation lead delay , process obtain TTE wait report may take day depend resource availability . Any echocardiography examination `` snapshot '' time , heart function change performance TTE commencement surgery . A FCU utilise echocardiography technique conventional TTE perform bedside test treat doctor answer clinical question aid clinical decision-making real time . It provide specific information relevant perioperative care time acute resuscitation potentially life-saving decision-making . A type FCU , iHeartScanTM , specifically design critical perioperative care develop Ultrasound Education Group The University Melbourne . FCU confirm accurate comprehensive TTE purpose acute clinical care . FCU endorse The American Society Echocardiography embrace critical care community . The case equipoise : The conventional approach proceed early surgery without delay cardiovascular investigation contrary proof-of-concept data preoperative FCU may reduce mortality provision well cardiovascular diagnostic information , lead management change . The use conventional TTE , however , cause considerable delay surgery , may increase mortality risk . FCU advantage provide improved diagnosis without cause substantial delay surgery , therefore additive rather competitive current `` best practice '' . An economic analysis routine FCU perform . Feasibility trial - ECHONOF II trial In preliminary study , feasibility routine FCU hip fracture surgery demonstrate , one patient per week one centre . To determine feasibility propose outcome randomise control trial ( RCT ) pilot study feasibility , safety , protocol compliance group separation conduct 2016 4-5 site across Australia , lead site Royal Melbourne Hospital . The pilot study analysis include patient recruit 30-day data available 2016 , though data continue collect 12 month . The pilot study protocol propose ( future ) definitive clinical trial , endpoint aim assess feasibility compliance . 1 . Feasibility outcomes 1. number patient screen : recruit ratio &lt; 4:1 2. recruitment rate 1 patient/week/centre 2 . Safety 1 . No harm patient perform FCU 2 . No surgical delay &gt; 1 hour wait FCU perform 3 . Protocol Compliance 1 . FCU perform &lt; 24 hr . surgery 2 . Treating team notify FCU result 3 . Follow time point ( unless death ) 4 . Incidence comprehensive TTE standard group surgery 5 . Adverse complication adjudication perform adjudication committee 4 . Group separation 1 . Completion preoperative actual perioperative management plan group 2 . Analysis difference diagnosis management group : aim &gt; 20 % difference group Research protocol Trial Design : A parallel group , randomise control , multicentre trial 1:1 allocation ratio . Participants : Patients present isolated , primary , non-metastatic fracture neck femur , surgery expect within 48 hour hospital admission recruit . Patients prior hip surgery affect side , cause likely due metastatic cancer , survival unlikely 24 hour admission include . Settings Locations : teach regional hospital Australia high volume hip fracture surgery necessary equipment expertise perform FCU agree participate . Intervention : Participants randomise FCU group receive preoperative FCU perform independent operator within 24 hour plan surgery , follow The University Melbourne iHeartScanTM protocol . Patients randomise standard care group undergo FCU surgery . There restriction treat team either group determine management employ , include anaesthesia technique , surgical management , perioperative care preoperative investigation include comprehensive TTE cardiology department . However treatment patient record , allow comparison effect FCU diagnosis management group . The control group represent standard care participate hospital . This typically include early surgery minimal preoperative investigation . Some patient , however , base clinical assessment treat doctor , additional investigation comprehensive TTE , could result change management include associate delay surgery . This trial interfere standard care management , , recruit , patient remain standard care group even receive comprehensive TTE delay surgery . Treatment group accord individual institutional practice , work diagnostic information available time . Randomisation : Randomisation cod block use web-based automatic enrolment system participate institution order facilitate recruitment across different time zone out-of-hours case . Patients stratify severity surgery ( hip replacement/hemiarthroplasty , femoral fixation ) institution ( tertiary referral , non-tertiary metropolitan/ regional hospital ) . The randomisation sequence generate use computer random sequence generator stratum block 10 ensure close balance number group one time trial . Allocation concealment implementation : The allocation sequence conceal web-based enrolment system . The site research staff recruit patient organise dependent practitioner perform FCU ( ) . The independent practitioner receive allocation whether perform FCU , place complete blank FCU form seal envelope . The treating doctor first complete management plan open envelope obtain complete blank FCU form . The FCU form place second sealed envelope open allocation sequence reveal . The research staff collect outcome data involve patient recruitment therefore blind group allocation . The central trial monitor adjudicate outcome assistance 2 clinician also blind allocation . Statistical method : The Statistical Consulting Group ( University Melbourne ) , supervise team statistician Dr Sandy Clarke , advise supervise statistical method , data management , integrity , security analysis . The primary outcome compare FCU control group use binary logistic regression , control group reference category . The survival time analyse use Cox proportional hazard regression . A pre-determined sub-group analysis separate without exist TTE previous 12 month . Relative risk death analyse use Cox proportional hazard regression . Patterns management relative risk ( death ) compare group use two-sample t-test include sub-group analysis pathology identify FCU ( e.g. , hypovolaemia , cardiac failure aortic stenosis ) . Clinical trial coordination : The trial manage Department Surgery , The University Melbourne . This include aspects trial control , data collation , site co-ordination . An independent committee include statistician , clinical trial monitor , clinician , member Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee oversee trial safety data integrity . The committee perform plan , blind interim analysis , 50 % recruitment . Endpoint adjudication committee An end point committee consist trial monitor 2 clinician , blind treatment allocation , establish adjudicate non-fatal cardiovascular event 6 monthly interval . This committee also advise event rate , ( blind ) group separation , feasibility stopping rule .</detailed_description>
