	<detailed_description>The investigator propose conduct treatment study intranasal oxytocin ( IN-OXT ) vs. placebo child adolescents Prader-Willi Syndrome ( PWS ) . OXT already proven safe effective treatment study socialization disruptive behavior adult PWS use infant PWS ongoing clinical trial . The investigator hypothesize OXT superior placebo positive effect child adolescent PWS eat repetitive behavior , social cognition . If proven superior , data add current knowledge OXT beneficial treatment minimal side effect PWS symptom . Additional knowledge OXT 's ability reduce overeat could lead improvement patient 's quality life physical health reduction familial stress . The investigator propose randomize double blind 8 week treatment trial intranasal OXT vs. placebo 24 subject age 5 18 year PWS order assess IN-OXT 's affect ( 1 ) Eating behavior ( 2 ) Repetitive disruptive behavior ( 3 ) social cognition measure ( 4 ) Salivary OXT level plasma level ghrelin , pancreatic polypeptide leptin . The investigator determine IN-OXT reduces eat behavior addition improve social cognition reduce repetitive/disruptive behavior child PWS . If superior placebo , data add current knowledge OXT effective treatment hyperphagia well problematic symptomatology PWS .</detailed_description>
