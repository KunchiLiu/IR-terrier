	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect foot orthoses two common condition ( ankle osteoarthritis symptomatic adult onset flat foot ) use custom biplane X-ray system group develop accurately precisely quantify foot bone motion . The investigator vary design orthoses subject examine find effective improving function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim proposal well understand in-shoe foot orthoses achieve improvement foot ankle function people ankle osteoarthritis ( OA ) and/or adult acquire flatfoot result posterior tibial tendon dysfunction ( PTTD ) . The investigator also aim able predict optimal , personalize orthotic device patient . These common , painful , often highly debilitate condition , ankle OA estimate affect around 6 % adult population adult acquire flat foot around 3.3 % percent female . It show foot orthoses effective conservative intervention condition , help postpone negate surgery . However , significant proportion patient foot orthoses unsuccessful , evidence may result significant inter-individual variability joint movement load response intervention . This may due number factor , include foot bone shape , muscle strength , and/or joint range motion . In addition , design foot orthoses often inconsistent supplier , largely manual approach use design manufacture . A complicating factor prescription foot orthoses often vaguely write . Improving investigator ' understanding different foot ankle responses variation foot orthotic design essential investigator improve device function level individual patient . To measure individual bone foot move use traditional technique , however , difficult . Such method rely skin-mounted marker track space determine foot ankle kinematics . However size position foot ankle bone mean possible measure individually . Moreover , movement skin underlie bone , know soft tissue artifact , introduces significant error measurement . This complicate need wear shoe orthoses function properly . The group develop biplane fluoroscopy system tailor address unique issue measure foot kinematics . This system additional advantage able measure effect foot orthotics unmodified shoe . To achieve objective understand able predict effect orthoses , specific aim : - [ 1 ] : To collect , via biplane fluoroscopy , kinematic data describe effect vary angle hindfoot post foot orthotics . These data obtain 90 participant : 30 ankle OA ; 30 symptomatic PTTD ; 30 healthy control . - [ 2 ] : Using data SA1 , carry regression analysis identify factor obtain biplane fluoroscopy clinical exam significantly influence individual 's response ( i.e. , hindfoot kinematics ) orthotic intervention . These factor include : foot type , bone geometry , static foot posture , joint axis location , range motion , muscle strength . - [ 3 ] : Using data SA1 , generate musculoskeletal model foot allow detailed analysis muscle ligament control ankle movement . This develop OpenSim model platform make freely available upon project completion . - [ 4 ] : To compare kinematic response orthotic device prescribe use standard method prescribe use algorithms insight SA2 SA3 separate group participant . Biplane fluoroscopy use collect kinematic data 10 patient ankle OA 10 PTTD compare performance three pair ( one traditional , one SA2 one SA3 ) orthotics . This data also use validate prediction result SA2 SA3 . This propose research project improve investigator ' understanding foot orthotics work help u prescribe effective device patient . This benefit large number people population ankle osteoarthritis adult acquire flat foot .</detailed_description>
