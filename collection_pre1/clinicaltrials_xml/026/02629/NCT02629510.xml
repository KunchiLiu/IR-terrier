	<brief_title>Efficacy Tachosil® Prevention Hemorrhage After Loop Electrosurgical Excisional Procedure ( LEEP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A loop electrosurgical excisional procedure ( LEEP ) medical technology commonly use order treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cervical cancer stage FIGO IA1 , well diagnose disease . Though loop electrosurgical excisional procedure cervix effective safe procedure , may cause discomfort due bleeding surgery , many case additional treatment shall implement order control hemorrhage . Up , number investigator make effort reduce frequency bleed additional hemostasis treatment loop electrosurgical excisional procedure cervix . Among method study far , method albothyl solution , Monsel 's solution , Tranexamic acid , Amino-Cerve , Fibrin glue apply surgical margin cervix , bleed stop use electrocautery method . However , none recognize effective reducing frequency bleed additional hemostasis treatment loop electrosurgical excisional procedure cervix . Accordingly , require carry research find new method . Tachosil , absorbable hemostatic surgical patch , compose collagen matrix coagulation factor , human fibirinogen human thrombin coat . It prove Tachosil effective safe styptic digestive , hapatobiliary , pulmonary , renal surgery . Unlike exist styptic , surgical patch Tachosil strong adhesion bleeding point , plug bleeding hole , expect great effect prevention bleed surgical margin cervix loop electrosurgical excisional procedure cervix . This study aim evaluate application Tachosil effective prevention bleed loop electrosurgical excisional procedure cervix .</detailed_description>
