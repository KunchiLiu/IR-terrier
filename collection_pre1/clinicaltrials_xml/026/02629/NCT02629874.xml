	<brief_summary>EA-230 newly develop synthetic compound anti-inflammatory property . Pre-clinical data indicate EA-230 may valuable treatment systemic inflammation result variety cause surgery , trauma , infection , irradiation others . Although previous study healthy volunteer show excellent safety profile , safety tolerability high dos administer per continuous infusion need investigate . Also , dose-effect relation systemic inflammation need elucidate phase II trial patient commence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although immune system essential survival , variety disease originate inappropriate activation immune response . Besides range auto-inflammatory disease like rheumatoid arthritis , inappropriate undesirable activation immune system occur infectious disease like sepsis , major surgery like cardiac artery bypass grafting , radiation therapy treatment cancer , organ transplantation . For auto-inflammatory disease , last decade therapy come available specifically target part immune system . The development 'biologicals ' , recombinant antibody specifically block one antigen receptor , enormous impact treatment chronic autoimmune disease . However , treatment show effective type ( acute ) systemic inflammation , like sepsis . Of many downstream consequence exaggerate inflammatory response , organ injury failure serious , often involve kidney . This also hold true cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass , various factor , include inflammatory cascade , cause temporarily decline even permanent loss renal function . As kidney failure independent prognostic factor mortality critically ill patient , treatment aim prevent acute kidney injury warrant . EA-230 novel pharmacological compound develop treatment systemic inflammatory state like sepsis , treatment inflammation associate organ dysfunction like acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . It 's linear tetrapeptide derive human chorionic gonadotropin hormone ( hCG ) . It show anti-inflammatory property protect organ failure several pre-clinical model sepsis systemic inflammation describe detail . Most notably , EA-230 show mark protective effect kidney abdominal sepsis animal . As EA-230 attenuates pro-inflammatory response neutrophil monocytes ex vivo , neutrophil influx tissue systemic inflammation vivo abrogate , think EA-230 act protect host detrimental effect neutrophil acute systemic inflammatory disease , thereby prevent organ damage , especially kidney . Having perform extensive research pharmacology , pharmacokinetics toxicology EA-230 , first human study previously conduct escalate single dos EA-230 , show EA-230 well tolerate i.v . dose 30 mg/kg three time day ( daily dose 90 mg/kg ) three day , result adverse event related study treatment . In human model systemic inflammation elicit administration low dose endotoxin , EA-230 show attenuate innate immune response single i.v . dose 10 mg/kg , even though EA-230 administer 30 minute endotoxin administration . A full dose- concentration-response profile collect study . In addition , , bolus administration EA-230 test , whereas view short terminal half life le 15 minute , continuous administration EA-230 long time interval may effective . For reason , additional phase I study healthy volunteer require complete profile EA-230 response inflammation dose dose range choose first 'prove-of-concept ' study patient . The safety profile EA-230 extend beyond daily dose 90 mg/kg address date ; dose- concentration response information collect escalation provide dose proof-of-concept testing patient .</detailed_description>
