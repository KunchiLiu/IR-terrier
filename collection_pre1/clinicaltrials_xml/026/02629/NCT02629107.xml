	<brief_summary>Background : An electroencephalogram ( EEG ) measure brain electrical activity . EEG show loud sound need wake person , deep person sleep . Researchers use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study people sleep view brain activity 3D . But still need correlate fMRI sound threshold , like EEG . Objective : To measure brain activity sleep use fMRI EEG . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18 34 sleep back several hour . Design : Participants screen online sleep general health . At screen visit , participant : Physical exam Hearing exam MRI scan . A strong magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . Participants lie bed slide scanner , shape like cylinder . Participants wear actigraph wrist record motor activity . Participants follow 2-week routine . This include regular in-to-bed out-of-bed time limit alcohol , caffeine , nicotine . At 3-day inpatient visit , participant : Hearing exam . Female subject urine pregnancy test . fMRI . A coil place head . Participants task show computer screen inside scanner . EEG . Small electrodes scalp record brain wave sleep task scanner . Participants ask try sleep researcher collect fMRI EEG data . Participants eye monitor video camera . Headphones deliver sound wake throughout night .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sleep Study With Auditory Stimuli</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE Electroencephalography generally consider gold standard define sleep , , fact , sleep behavior define widely accept behavioral characteristic like auditory arousal threshold . Electroencephalography merely become surrogate behavioral definition , first electroencephalographic sleep study , researcher discover strong correlation electroencephalographic slow wave auditory arousal threshold . With advent functional magnetic resonance imaging , one would expect first sleep study use new measure would design correlate auditory arousal threshold . However , study never conduct . This protocol fill gap literature . We hypothesize undiscovered pattern brain activity functional connectivity exist sleep approach defines sleep behaviorally expose pattern . STUDY POPULATION The subject group study young , healthy individual excellent sleep health . Choosing subject group maximize probability subject sleep all-night functional magnetic resonance imaging . Our target number completers 12 . DESIGN After two-week home-monitoring period include regular in-to-bed out-of bed time , subject undergo two consecutive all-night functional magnetic resonance image sleep study . The first night serve adaptation night , know reduce sleep alteration accompany sleep laboratory environment . We measure sleep depth behaviorally arouse subject auditory stimulus progressively increase intensity . This procedure perform approximately eight time per night . The timing arousal distribute pseudorandomly across night . EXPLORATORY DATA GENERATED The exploratory data generate auditory arousal threshold precede brain activity functional connectivity derive functional magnetic resonance imaging .</detailed_description>
