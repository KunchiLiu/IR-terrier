	<brief_summary>This study multi-center , single-arm , open-label study healthy participant assess pain , tolerability , injection leakage , safety , usability single self-administered subcutaneous ( SC ) dose etrolizumab . Some participant receive `` needle-experience '' train use needle syringe Days -7 -5 , health care professional ( HCPs ) ass participant 's suitability self-inject prefilled auto-injector ( AI ) . The remainder participant `` needle na√Øve '' previously self-injected . Eligible '' needle experience '' '' needle naive '' participant attend AI train visit study site Day -3 ( three day prior etrolizumab dose Day 1 ) . Following training simulated injection participant HCP determine participant suitable proceed actual etrolizumab dosing . All eligible study participant self administer single dose etrolizumab ( AI ) Day 1 follow Day 85 follow dosing . Pain , tolerability , safety usuability assess .</brief_summary>
