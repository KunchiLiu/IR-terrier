	<detailed_description>Elderly patient poor cardiopulmonary reserve tend suffer high risk develop complication follow major surgery [ 1 ] . Quite research show benefit goal-directed therapy ( GDT ) use fluid load inotropic agent improve outcome major surgery [ 2-7 ] . The maintenance adequate tissue perfusion global oxygen delivery ( DO2I ) essential maintain adequate tissue perfusion oxygenation relation increase metabolic demand high risk surgery . However , concern inotropic therapy supernormal oxygen delivery may lead increase incidence myocardial ischemia [ 8 ] . Even though meta-analysis state DO2I optimization could possibly reduce incidence cardiac complication stroke volume optimization strategy [ 9 ] , evidence available literature regard effect myocardial ischemia surgical patient , especially non-cardiac surgical patient . This study undertaken test hypothesis intraoperative DO2I optimization result decrease myocardial ischemia elderly high-risk surgical patient . The investigator conduct prospective , randomize , control , double-blinded trial seventy patient schedule proximal femur surgery General anesthesia follow nerve block . Both patient allocate one two equal group receive either intraoperative fluid regimen guide SV strategy DO2I strategy . In control ( SV ) group , patient receive intravenous infusion 250 ml Ringer 's lactate solution 5 min fluid challenge stroke volume maximization . In experimental ( DO2I ) group , fluid dobutamine give reach stroke volume maximization supernormal oxygen delivery . The primary outcome preoperative 24h postoperative serum concentration troponin T. Secondary outcome include incidence tachycardia , arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , pneumonedema acute heart failure , blood pressure , pulmonary infection , fluid volume , blood transfusion volume , renal function , PONV , Length postoperative hospital stay mortality . Data collect recorded clinical team blind study arm allocation .</detailed_description>
