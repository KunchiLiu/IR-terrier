	<brief_summary>Cardiac arrest public health problem lead cause death many part world . Cardiac arrest occur inside hospital outside . In United States Canada occur approximately 350,000 case cardiac arrest year , receive CPR , Half outside hospital . Treatment cardiac arrest perform Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR ) early defibrillation . Performing compression essential part perform CPR arrival defibrillation . Efforts make simplify implementation basic CPR make accessible everyone . Method `` hand CPR '' offer CPR compression without ventilation , Studies show similar survival rate '' hand CPR '' method CPR ventilation . Patient 's chance survival high bystander begin perform CPR train medical staff arrive . Chances survival decrease 7-10 % every passing minute past moment collapse perform CPR . MDA survey carry 1984-5 reported start CPR bystander 8 % Another survey 2000 report 14 % , In recent study Jerusalem find rate 15 % perform compression bystanders- A low rate compare 33 % report United States 41.3 % Japan 44.9 % Denmark . The average time arrival medical team Israel 10.3 minute , important begin perform CPR present arrival medical staff .
