	<detailed_description>Summary : Migraine affect 15 % Western Australians lead cause suffer disability community . Research suggest inflammation brain 's covering ( meninges ) nerve cell inflammation release 'free radical ' , cause migraine . N-acetylcysteine , Vitamin E Vitamin C powerful anti-oxidants ( free-radical scavenger ) reduce brain inflammation nerve activity . It therefore possible anti-oxidants could reduce number severity migraine . We study 90 subject see combination N-acetylcysteine 600 mg , Vitamin E 250 IU vitamin C 500 mg ( NEC ) take twice daily 3 month , reduce migraine attack . This safe vitamin-based therapy never study effective , play important role migraine prevention . Because migraine complex neuro-vascular-inflammatory disorder 'cascade ' step , many potentially target drug prophylaxis . Research highlight importance brain neuro-inflammation mediate Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide ( CGRP ) Substance P ( SP ) , oxygen nitrogen free radical specie ( FRS ) ( eg . nitric oxide [ NO ] ) pathogenesis migraine . Increased level NO CGRP find jugular venous blood migraineurs NO produce cerebral vasodilation , key step migraine generation . Furthermore , FRS activate trigeminal-cervical nucleus ( TCN ) main centre nociceptive ( pain ) sensitization headaches—Sumatriptan block process account anti-migraine effect . Anti-oxidants N-acetylcysteine ( NAc ) , Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) ( VitC ) Vitamin E ( alpha-tocopherol ) ( VitE ) potent FRS 'scavengers ' , mean could use prevent migraine . Two small non-randomised trial suggest antioxidant reduce migraine frequency disability . Like sumatriptan , NAc reduce activation TCN NO , also neuro-inflammation brain disorder Parkinson 's disease . VitC VitE reduce NO level mice VitC enhance neuro-inhibitory effect gamma amino butyric acid central nervous system—This mechanism could conceivably interrupt 'spreading cortical activation ' first step migraine cascade . Migraineurs increase risk develop analogous neuro-inflammatory disorder , Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS ) ; increase plasma level SP , CGRP FRS find patient condition . CRPS respond treatment NAc VitC . A meta-analysis found combine ( single-agent ) anti-oxidant therapy ( CAT ) safe effective treat chronic pancreatitis , inflammatory pain disorder similar CRPS migraine . We previously propose migraine consider form 'CRPS brain ' therefore ( like CRPS ) may also respond CAT . Literature review confirm theory yet explore . We therefore test hypothesis twice-daily administration combination NAC 600 mg , VitE 250 IU VitC 500 mg ( NEC ) 12 week , significantly reduce migraine frequency . If proven effective , NEC inexpensive , accessible safe treatment manage burden migraine Western Australian community Experimental hypothesis Twice-daily administration NEC ( NAc 600 mg , VitE 250 IU VitC 500 mg ) 12 week significantly reduce migraine frequency patient experience two-to-eight migraine per month , compare placebo-control group . Methods : Study design base guideline migraine clinical trial International Headache Society ( IHS ) 2013 . It clinically-pragmatic , proof-of-concept investigation . Trial design : Prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , two parallel-group trial . Subjects : Males females 18 65 year age . Recruitment : Convenience sample migraine patient attend general practice clinic , neurology clinic link UNDA Sydney pain clinic ( Joondalup Health Campus ) ; via Headache Australia , Chronic Pain Australia , UNDA Fremantle Hospital Research Foundation websites , newspaper advertising , require . NB : Subjects stabilise one migraine prevention drug exclude study , cessation washout drug would hinder recruitment retention reflect 'real-life ' clinical practice . Power calculation The population adequately power RCT calculate data similar study migraine prevention ( 30-35 ) . It estimate 60 % subject active study group 30 % placebo-control group report 'positive outcome ' ( ≥ 30 % reduction headache frequency , baseline ) . With 80 % power p &lt; 0.05 , study population RCT 84 subject . An interim proof-of-concept ( pilot ) analysis perform 40 subject ( 20 group ) complete study , base guideline pilot study Lancaster et al . Number subject : 84 subject total , 42 study group . Active study group ( n=42 ) placebo-control group ( n=42 ) . Randomisation blinding : Computer randomization subject 'blocks ' 10 , per IHS migraine trial guideline . Subjects , researcher data analyst blind . A pharmacist dispense active ( NEC ) sham trial drug maintain record . Study duration : 16 week ( 112 day , four month ) total ; four week baseline study phase ( stabilization baseline measurement ) ; 12 week active study phase . Start : January 1 , 2016 . Finish : January 1 , 2017 . Study logistics flow : - Ethics approval . - Advertising . - Serial recruitment subject . - Informed consent obtain . - Study enrolment interview researcher . - Subjects provide paper headache diary must complete minimum five day per week 16 week study ; take long 5 minute per day . - Four week baseline study phase , baseline outcome measure . - After baseline phase , subject stratify &lt; 3 ≥ migraine per month , per IHS guideline . - Computer randomisation within stratum 'blocks ' 10 , per IHS 2013 . - Randomised active ( NEC ) placebo-controlled ( sham ) study group . - They need take either verum placebo tablet twice daily 12 week . - 12 week active study phase begin . - Daily entry headache diary . - Control compliance visit phone contact every 4 week . - Study termination face-to-face interview end week 12 . - Collect diary left-over trial drug . - Data collate blind researcher . - Statistical analysis perform independent statistician . - Data retain secure location five year . Data collection analysis : Headache diary base ; Headache diary-preventive therapy , version 4 , IHS guideline control trial drug migraine , 2011 . Headache diary must complete least five day week baseline active study phase . Study drug must consume least five day week active study phase . Intention-to-treat analysis : data drop-outs partial study completion analyse report . Statistical analysis : Analysis independent , blind biostatistician UNDA School Medicine Health Research Institute , Fremantle WA , use SAS® version 9.2 statistical software ( Cary NC , USA ) Excel spreadsheet 2007™ ( Redmond WA , USA ) statistical package . Analysis outcomes perform intention-to-treat population . Some post hoc analysis data may perform . Significance level : p &lt; 0.05 ; confidence limit 95 % . Data set : Demographic , clinical , outcomes data . Descriptive data : Frequencies , percentage ( categorical data ) ; mean , standard deviation , confidence interval ( continuous data ) . Comparative data analysis : Student 's test continuous data ; Chi square test categorical data ; confidence interval ; linear logistic regression . Research team : MBBS honour student UNDA ; research nurse ; research academic ; clinician ; statistician ; pharmacist ; secretarial support . Equipment : Paper headache diary ; NEC sham drug capsule compound pharmacy ; computer ; consult space ; telephone website access ; secure data base .
