	<brief_summary>Some patient shoulder pain decrease body awareness ( BA ) . To degree , pain among patient increase due lack BA . Psychomotor therapy think improve BA thereby increase effect traditional therapy , physiotherapy exercise . The aim study therefore investigate psychomotor therapy , compliment treatment physiotherapy , decrease shoulder patient ' function deficit pain report PRO 's , compare physiotherapy alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : This trial , randomise , control , observer-blinded superiority trial , two-group parallel design , conduct Denmark . The primary endpoint 12 week baseline . Patients randomise either `` Intervention+Usual Care '' `` Usual Care '' ( block randomization 1:1 allocation ) . Settings location : Patients recruit shoulder unit outpatient clinic , orthopaedic department Hospital Lillebaelt - Vejle Hospital . Randomisation allocation concealment : Patients randomly assign either two group 1:1 allocation per computergenerated randomisation schedule , stratify administration concomitant corticosteroid injection use permuted block random size ( two six ) . The primary investigator , assessor administrator randomisation procedure know block size order ensure allocation concealment Blinding : Outcome assessor perform baseline followup assessment , keep blind treatment allocation . At follow-up assessment , patient strongly encourage disclose component intervention programme , order keep outcome assessor blind . Statistical analysis plan : The primary efficacy analysis perform assessment between-group difference change DASH score 12 week intent-to-treat ( ITT ) population ( randomised patient independent compliance withdrawal ) . In case miss data due dropout , non-responder imputation apply ; baseline observation carry forward ( BOCF ) technique use patient complete study . For primary analysis week 12 , use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) compare progressive high-load exercise group low-load exercise group mean change baseline DASH score , well secondary continuous outcome . The primary model include change baseline dependent variable , treatment group ( Intervention OR Usual care ) , corticosteroid status ( yes ) main effect , baseline score additional covariate . To analyse longitudinal element time effect NRS randomize trial ( repeated measure design 1-24 week ) , linear approach use , fit SAS software ( version 9.3 Service Pack 4 ; SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , North Carolina , United States ) use procedure 'PROC MIXED ' base restrict maximum likelihood ( REML ) estimate parameter . The variable 'patient ' applied random effect factor . Assessment treatment time effect exploratory interest primary outcome test possible interaction , treatment time use systematic factor , use baseline value covariate reduce random variation increase power .</detailed_description>
