Lack physical activity ( PA ) establish sedentary behaviour ( SB ) constitute additional burden , related progression chronic disease disable condition . An exist initiative battle SB insufficient PA level exercise referral scheme ( ERS ) implement primary care , insufficiently active individual refer third party service ( sport centre leisure facility ) prescribe monitor exercise programme tailor patient ' need . ERS show improvement PA short-term , may limited power change SB produce long-term effect . Thus , ERS might enhance self-management strategy ( SMS ) promote behavioural change . Such strategy base social cognitive theory show increase self-confidence , power act , involvement exercise . In first stage , systematic review , focus group feasibility study conduct . Then , three-armed pragmatic randomize control trial ( RCT ) ass long-term effectiveness ( 18-month follow-up ) complex intervention sedentary behaviour ( SB ) elderly population , base exist ERS enhance self-management strategy ( SMS ) . It compare ERS alone general recommendation plus two educational session . The RCT include 1338 subject follow 18 month . The effect SB measure sit time number minute spent activity require â‰¤ 1.5 Metabolic Equivalent Tasks , PA daily count per minute intensity exercise , daily step count . Secondary outcome include : physical function , healthcare use cost , anthropometry , bioimpedance , blood pressure , self-rated health quality life , activity daily live , anxiety , depressive symptom , social network , physical activity self-regulation , self-efficacy exercise , disability , fear fall , loneliness , executive function , physical fatigue .
