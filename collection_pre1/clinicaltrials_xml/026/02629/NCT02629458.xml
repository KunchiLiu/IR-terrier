	<brief_summary>Stage I non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) curable surgery consider standard care fit , good performance status patient . However , high proportion patient stage 1 NSCLC elderly and/or medical co-morbidities therefore high risk surgical complication . The optimal treatment patient unknown . SABR may equally appropriate treatment need formally assess . Funded NIHR Research Patient Benefit , SABRtooth UK multi-centre , two-group individually randomise control feasibility study patient peripheral stage I non-small cell lung cancer consider high risk surgery . In total , 54 patient plan recruited 4 treatment site 2 referral site . This study aim determine feasibility acceptability perform largescale definitive randomise phase III trial compare surgery stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) . The qualitative substudy exploration reason nonparticipation SABRTooth trial . As two treatment different , patient may strong preference either surgery SABR , may feel uncomfortable decision distinct option take hand . Understanding patient choose participate take treatment allocation crucial demonstrate recruit large scale phase III trial feasible . We explore patient , decline particpation study intiailly consent subsequently fail take randomimsed treatment arm , understand , perceive feel , SABRTooth trial present expectation study burden .</brief_summary>
