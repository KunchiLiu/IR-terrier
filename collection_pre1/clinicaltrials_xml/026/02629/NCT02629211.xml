	<brief_title>Initial Experience With Novel Single-Balloon Enteroscopy System Children With IBD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 15 % -25 % diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) case , disease manifestation begin age 18 . IBD primary include Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Studies show current incidence pediatric IBD range 4-7 case per 100,000 , worldwide . Early accurate diagnosis IBD important correct prognosis , course disease , therapeutic decision follow-up . Complete diagnostic work-up key proper diagnosis patients.Early diagnosis IBD differentiation UC CD difficult child . The major issue face pediatric IBD today include accurate disease classification , unknown extent disease , complete bowel visualization , inability reach depth finding , biopsy retrieval diagnostic work-up . The NaviAid™ AB device present new unique concept help overcome short coming IBD diagnosis treatment . Through repetitive inflation deflation NaviAid™ AB , endoscope swiftly advanced deep small bowel via proximal distal route , allow complete visualization small bowel easy biopsy sample histopathology . As result , subsequent diagnosis influence proper action treatment therapy patient . Although many study report safety efficacy balloon enteroscopy adult IBD , investigation value balloon enteroscopy pediatric patient know suspected IBD still require . This single-center , non-randomized open-label study intend evaluate safety efficacy NaviAid™ AB device small bowel enteroscopy child know suspected IBD .</detailed_description>
