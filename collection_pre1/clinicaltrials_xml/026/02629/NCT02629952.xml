	<brief_summary>Plant derive compound , e.g . flavonoid dark chocolate , green tea , blueberry , show great potential nutraceuticals treatment various disease type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . Flavonoids suggest improve glucose metabolism , reduce blood lipid , reduce oxidative stress improve vascular function . For reason recently investigate effect daily consumption locally produce blueberry tea demonstrate could partially restore insulin sensitivity animal model . We propose translate finding assess efficacy nutraceutical new treatment improve glucose tolerance people T2D .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Benefits Drinking Blueberry Tea Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment T2D limit , unwanted side effect , lose effectiveness time . There grow public interest use complementary alternative approach treat insulin resistance T2D . Blueberries , blueberry leave cinnamon report improve insulin sensitivity insulin action . Blueberry Boost™ locally produce Blueberry Tea proprietary blend dry blueberry ( 37 % wt/wt ) , blueberry leaf , raspberry leaf , spearmint leaf cinnamon . It well establish improve glycemic control important manage insulin resistance T2D associate vascular pathology directly contribute end-organ damage ( microvascular disease ) , hypertension cardiovascular disease ( stroke , heart attack heart failure ) . We recently demonstrate unique blueberry tea blend fully restore vascular insulin sensitivity muscle high-fat fed insulin-resistant rat model associate substantial improvement muscle glucose uptake whole body insulin sensitivity . We propose translate finding assess efficacy nutraceutical new treatment improve glucose tolerance people T2D . Aim : Determine whether chronic consumption ( 4 week ) blueberry tea improve metabolic vascular health people without T2D .</detailed_description>
