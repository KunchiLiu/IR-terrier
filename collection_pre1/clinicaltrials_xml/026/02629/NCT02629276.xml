	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate potential difference somatosensory function patient unilateral NSNAP without positive ND compare healthy control . Furthermore , determine whether difference group symptom severity , functional deficit , psychological parameter , quality life sleep .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Somatosensory Phenotype Patients Suffering From Unspecific Neck Arm Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neck pain common musculoskeletal problem , 30-50 % adult experience neck pain give year . Neck pain combination arm pain common neck pain alone associate high Ievels self-reported disability psychological impairment . In case , pathophysiological correlate find various investigation include magnetic resonance image cervical spine test nerve conductivity ( bedside neurological examination standard electro diagnostic test ) . In case , neck-arm pain label non-specific . Although clinical examination evaluate conductivity nervous system normal non-specific neck-arm pain ( NSNAP ) , neurodynamic test ( ND ) identify positive subgroup patient . ND clinical tool design elongate nerve bed , therefore increase mechanical load neural tissue . As , ND provide information alteration neural tissue mechanosensitivity , i.e . presence heighten nerve mechanosensitivity . It assume increased neural mechanosensitivity reflect gain function , presumably mediate small nociceptive fibre intraneurally within epineurium ( nervi nervorum ) . However , remain unclear whether subgroup patient NSNAP positive ND indeed increase gain function small fibre population compare patient normal ND . Quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) commonly use tool determine function different subset small ( C , Ad-fibres ) large nerve fibre ( Ad-fibres ) . Using QST , recent study identify loss small fibre function patient unilateral NSNAP positive ND apparent reduce warm detection threshold compare non-affected side . However , difference small potentially clinically rele-vant relatively small sample size n=8 allow generalization result . In study , patient NSNAP also characterize gain function , i.e . cold hypersensitivity . Similarly , widespread thermal pressure hypersensitivity document patient nonspecific arm pain ( without neck pain ) . None study however investigate potential difference patient NSNAP positive versus negative ND , leave unclear whether QST finding indeed attribute positive ND . A recent study compare patient NSNAP neuropathic feature use ND test self report neuropathic pain screen tool patient NSNAP neuropathic feature . Interestingly , first group show heighten nerve mechanosensitivity apparent earlier onset symptom ND test . This raise question whether patient NSNAP positive ND indeed dysfunction nervous system differentiate patient normal ND .</detailed_description>
