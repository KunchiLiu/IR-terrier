	<brief_summary>High body weight protective hip spine fracture , find increase risk humerus , foot ankle fracture . Increasing understanding action adipokines bone suggest may complex effect different aspect bone geometry microarchitecture effect may vary depend whether adipokines act directly bone cell central nervous system cortical trabecular compartment . Previous research limit use areal dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan may inaccurate obese population due increase body thickness . The aim study investigate effect obesity bone mineral density , bone geometry , bone microarchitecture bone strength hip , lumbar spine , distal radius tibia . This observational , cross-sectional study normal weight obese individual match age , gender , height , postcode smoking . The total number subject 240 ; men premenopausal woman age 25 40 year men postmenopausal woman age 55 75 year . DXA , high-resolution peripheral compute tomography ( HR-pQCT ) , quantitative compute tomography ( QCT ) finite element analysis use assess bone structure strength . Biochemical marker bone turnover hormone relate bone metabolism also measure order identify potential mediator effect obesity bone structure strength . A sub-study included evaluate interaction fracture risk cardiovascular risk obese non-obese individual . There evidence interaction bone mineral density ( BMD ) cardiovascular risk test hypothesis common pathway link BMD cardiovascular risk , include fat secretion inflammatory cytokine e.g . interleukin-1 adipokines e.g . leptin adiponectin . Ultrasound base assessment vascular function use assess cardiac risk relate measure bone density . Obese individual lower circulating level 25OHD . This may due poor nutritional intake , reduce sunlight exposure vitamin D store fat tissue . The investigator measure level 25OHD lean , overweight obese men woman examine whether 25 ( OH ) D relate age gender whether low 25OHD obesity affect bone health subset lean , overweight obese participant different age .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Obesity Bone Structure Strength</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single centre , observational , cross-sectional , case-controlled study determine effect obesity bone structure strength . Cases obese individual control lean individual . Overweight individual increase applicability vitamin D sub-study general population . Cases individually match control gender , age , height , first part postcode ( e.g . S5 , S10 ) smoking , list order priority . Individually matched control reduce influence potential confounding factor data collect . Blinding applicable study design . Participants age 25-40 year attend two visit : Visit 1 - Consent , questionnaire , anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ) , triceps skinfold ) , tympanic temperature , blood sampling , neuromuscular function test ( chair stand test , narrow walk test grip strength ) Visit 2 - Anthropometric measurement ( height , weight ) , pregnancy test , measurement supine abdominal thickness , hip width measurement , DXA ( whole body , spine , hip ) , HR-pQCT ( tibia , radius ) , QCT ( spine hip ) . Participants age 55-75 year attend three visit ; visit 1 2 young participant , additional visit form cardiovascular sub-study : Visit 3 - Anthropometric measurement ( height , weight ) , blood pressure , cardiovascular risk measurement ( abdominal aortic calcification ( AAC ) , flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) , carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ) , pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) ABPI ) . Due seasonality vitamin D level , vitamin D sub-study must complete summer month . Participants complete main study prior August 2012 give consent contact regard future research invite participate vitamin D sub-study telephone subsequently send write information vitamin D sub-study . Volunteers invite attend one additional visit August 2012 October 2012 . Future participant ( yet consent take part main study ) invite participate vitamin D sub-study prior consent main study . As vitamin D level affect seasonality , substudy component complete visit 1 main study participant attend first study visit August 2012 October 2012 . However , participant attend visit 1 main study October 2012 April 2013 invite attend additional visit complete vitamin D sub-study summer/autumn 2013 . Participation vitamin D sub-study require small blood sample take completion diet sun exposure questionnaires . The effect obesity bone structure determine compare measure BMD , bone microarchitecture geometry obese study group lean group . The effect obesity bone strength determine use Finite element analysis ( FEA ) . Outcomes neuromuscular function test compare lean obese group determine effect obesity low extremity strength , balance , coordination flexibility . Hormones bone turnover marker compare lean obese participant association hormone bone turnover marker measure bone structure strength identify . The relationship cardiovascular risk BMD assess compare measure FMD , CIMT , PWV , AAC ABPI obese sub-study group lean sub-study group . The interaction cardiovascular risk fracture risk study use surrogate imaging atherosclerosis risk . Comparisons level hormone , inflammatory marker biochemical factor make lean obese participant test make association measure measure cardiovascular risk . The primary outcome main study mean difference hip BMD obese lean individual . Secondary outcome mean difference cross-sectional moment inertia , cortical trabecular BMD , bone microarchitecture geometry neuromuscular function lean obese individual , association BMD cardiovascular risk association body weight circulate 25 ( OH ) D .</detailed_description>
