	<brief_summary>Surgical reconstruction anatomical structure head neck cancer resection make enormous stride past 20 year advance flap technique usage perforate vessel , accurate consistent identification perforators remain challenge due vary anatomy vasculature donor region . Computed tomography angiography ( CTA ) use increasingly preoperative free flap perforator map breast reconstruction limit head neck application . In addition , indocyanine green ( ICG ) assist NIR fluorescence angiography develop intra-operative flap assessment . In study , investigator propose assess previously undocumented , multi-modal imaging technique preoperative dual energy CTA design intraoperative ICG assist NIR angiography ass free flap head neck reconstruction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Modality Imaging Head &amp; Neck Cancer Free Flap Design Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CTA NIR-assisted ICG angiography use map free flap . CTA provide surgeon preoperative information vascular anatomy facilitate surgical planning flap harvesting . The advantage CTA noninvasive , rapid , easy read surgeon . Moreover , provide information help surgeon decide site explore operation reduces rate injure miss optimal perforator . This technique help reduce size incision need perforator exploration , help reduce patient 's postoperative discomfort . The operation time reduce choose suitable perforators preoperative stage , also help reduce cost hospitalization . NIR-assisted angiography give live localization flap 's dominant perforator perfusion zone quantify relative tissue perfusion immediate skin paddle design .</detailed_description>
