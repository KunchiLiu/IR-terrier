	<brief_summary>Chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) affect white blood cell function . Currently , curative treatment bone marrow transplant replace abnormal stem cell new one ( donor cell ) capable make normal immune system . Transplant problem include graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) graft rejection . With GvHD , donor cell attack recipient normal tissue . Researchers want use preparation drug high cell dose increase graft success . They want use 2 immunosuppressive drug ( cyclophosphamide sirolimus ) lessen risk GvHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Dose Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation With Post Transplant Cyclophosphamide Patients With Chronic Granulomatous Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Granulomatous Disease inherit disorder result failure produce NADPH oxidase , necessary protection number infectious organism . Patients subject recurrent infection inflammatory complication . The current management participant limit close surveillance infection , administration prophylactic antimicrobial , rapid aggressive treatment suspect documented infection broad-spectrum antibiotic . Although often effective , treatment require long hospitalization , impact overall quality life significantly , lead significant morbidity , renal failure deafness . Currently , available cure disorder bone marrow transplantation , commonly use HLA-matched related sibling donor ( Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation ) . However , 30 % participant general population HLA- match related sibling , allogeneic related transplantation often option , result need match unrelated donor transplantation . The National Marrow Donor Program serve national registry volunteer willing donate progenitor cell eligible recipient well repository cord blood product . Despite continued improvement use transplantation schema include development nonmyeloablative regimen remain significant morbidity mortality associate transplantation , particular , graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) graft rejection . GvHD result graft recognize host antigen foreign , typically presence inflammation , result type iatrogenic autoimmune disease . For participant non-malignant disease , aim transplant solely replace defective deficient cell population . Furthermore , graft versus tumor effect require , regimen design establish tolerance induction and/or stable mixed chimerism may preferable cure participant population ; therefore , alternate transplant strategy use suppress development GvHD effect . In prior protocol successful achieve low rate Graft versus Host Disease ( GvHD ) , use nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen significant rate graft failure and/or loss . To improve upon result therefore propose increase target cell dose infuse use post transplant cyclophosphamide mitigate increase risk Graft versus Host Disease . For patient HLA match sibling donor ( Group 1-Sibling Related ) propose use busulfan-based , nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen combine Alemtuzumab ( Campath-1H , Campath ) immunosuppressive monoclonal antibody currently approve FDA single treatment patient B-CLL ; however , protocol use mechanism action immunosuppressive agent . For GvHD prophylaxis use post transplant cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) sirolimus ( Rapamune ) . For patient match unrelated donor ( Group 2-MUD ) also use similar conditioning regimen , modification include addition Total Body Irradiation ( due increase risk graft rejection HLA-matched unrelated cell ) We compare result obtain previous clinical trial use post transplant Cytoxan cell dose infuse low target dose 12 million study , use condition regimen .</detailed_description>
