	<detailed_description>Complications diabetes represent main concern modern diabetes therapy , become priority characterise pathophysiological mechanism complication ensure development novel rational therapeutic strategy . Although prolonged exposure tissue hyperglycaemia primary causative factor chronic diabetes complication , recently become increasingly evident hypoxia also play important role diabetes complication . A low tissue concentration oxygen diabetes consequence several mechanism ( e.g. , deficient blood supply micro- macro-vascular disease , poor local oxygen diffusion local oedema , result increase oxygen consumption ) . Adaptive response cell hypoxia mediate Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 ( HIF ) , heterodimeric transcription factor compose subunit , constitutively express mammalian cell . The regulation HIF activity critically dependent subunit degradation normoxia . Under hypoxic condition , HIF-1 stabilise , bind HRE ( hypoxic responsive element ) up-regulates gene series involve angiogenesis , glycolytic energy metabolism , cell proliferation , survival , enable cell adapt reduce oxygen availability . It estimate 800 gene direct HIF target . HIF-1 central expression multiple angiogenic growth factor ( review [ 6 ] ) , endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) recruitment . Recently , propose microRNAs ( ex . mir210 ) also mediate HIF-1 function . Several piece evidence point defective response diabetic tissue hypoxia . An impaired hypoxia response present tissue investigate diabetic animal diabetic patient . Hyperglycaemia directly repress HIF stability function multiple level , mechanism completely understood . An impaired reaction hypoxia diabetes might important consequence acute hypoxic challenge acute heart infarction , stroke , limb ischemia also subtle regulation cardiovascular respiratory system consequence autonomic neuropathy potential severe prognostic effect late cardiovascular event . Interventional study address cardiovascular response intermittent hypoxia ( IH ) compare normoxia exposure patient diabetes . However order establish appropriateness cardiovascular reaction hypoxia diabetes need investigate cardiorespiratory response towards IH patient diabetes compare matched non diabetic control subject . Moreover essentially establish angiogenetic response experimental design . The hypothesis study cardiorespiratory reaction mediate autonomic nervous system angiogenetic response impair patient diabetes consequence impair HIF reaction see tissue . The investigator plan study effect intermittent hypoxia ( IH ) consist five hypoxic period ( 13 % O2 inspire fraction oxygen ) last 6 min , five normoxic interval duration 15 patient type 1 diabetes without clinical sign neuropathy 15 non diabetic control match sex , BMI , age . The study perform one day . Methods : Baseline data obtain morning test day least 2 h breakfast . Subjects advise abstain caffeinated beverage 12 h alcohol 36 h prior testing . Blood pressure heart rate arterial oxygen saturation continuously measure . In case decrease oxygen saturation 80 % occurrence symptom , hypoxia would discontinue oxygen level reach least 80 % . A technician regulate control breathe period supervision medical doctor way intervention could observe patient . Thereafter , three measurement session perform : immediately ( t2 ) , 3 h ( t3 ) , 6 h ( t4 ) . After t2 , patient obtaine individual meal accord diet requirement . Cardiovascular respiratory test . Hypoxic ventilatory response ( HVR ) hypercapnic ventilatory response ( HCVR ) evaluate determine respiratory system activity . All patient test supine position silent room comfortable temperature . Before participant connect rebreathing circuit mouthpiece antibacterial filter , spontaneous breathing room air rest perform for4 min order obtain baseline data . During condition , investigator perform continuous measurement oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) pulse oximeter end-tidal CO2 ( CO2-et ) use capnograph connect mouthpiece . Recordings electrocardiogram perform chest lead , continuous noninvasive blood pressure record use cuff method . A heated Fleish pneumotachograph connect differential pressure transducer insert series expiratory component rebreathing system measure airway flow . For measurement response hypoxia , participant connect rebreathing circuit induce progressive decrease SaO2 maintain CO2-et value constant level , SaO2 reach 80 % , measure breath-to-breath change minute ventilation . The response hypercapnia evaluate ventilatory change induce progressive increase CO2-et level ( 13 mmHg resting level ) , SaO2 maintain 98 % oxygen low flow . Cardiovascular autonomic function determine perform four test accord recent guideline : deep-breathing , 30:15 ratio , Valsalva maneuver systolic blood pressure response stand . Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy define `` presence two abnormal test '' . Measurement chemoreflex sensitivity : The slope linear regression line minute ventilation versus SaO2 CO2-et indicate case chemoreflex sensitivity hypoxia hypercapnia . In hypercapnic test , point ventilation start increase indicate ventilator recruitment threshold CO2 ( VRT- CO2 ) . VRT- CO2 identify interpolate ventilation/CO2-et plot fourth-order polynomial function . Assessment baroreflex sensitivity : The baroreflex sensitivity ( BRS ) measure spontaneous breathe measurement session . Since previous study document good performance one method others , investigator calculate average seven different method : positive negative sequence , a-coefficient low- high-frequency band average , transfer function technique , ratio SDs R-R interval systolic blood pressure variability . Besides BRS , SD R-R interval ( SDNN ) apply determine global index heart rate variability . This selection do base fact normal distribution pronounce variable compare index variability ( e.g. , variance ) . The Hypoxic ventilatory response ( HVR ) hypercapnic ventilatory response ( HCVR ) , baroreflex sensitivity ( BRS ) evaluate ( t1 ) , immediately ( t2 ) , 3 h ( t3 ) , 6 h ( t4 ) IH . The angiogenetic potential evaluate endpoint measure serum relevant cytokine gene target HIF-1 ( i.e . VEGFA , SDF-1a , erythropoietin etc ) . The direct response HIF signaling evaluate serum level mir210 exclusively regulate HIF . The absolute endothelial precoursor cell account ( EPC ) response evaluate time point FACS analysis number CD34+/CD133+/KDR +</detailed_description>
