	<brief_summary>Irreversible pulpitis inflammatory condition dental pulp , highly painful , represent one main reason consult dental emergency . The recommended emergency care partial endodontic treatment local and/or locoregional anesthesia . The purpose emergency partial endodontic treatment stop pain pulpitis remove portion pulp . The final endodontic treatment ideally perform 72 hour . The literature report major difficulty obtain adequate anesthesia mandible perform partial endodontic treatment , especially mandibular molar . This result painful care patient . The management type emergency costly term equipment time health facility . Patient comfort , cost save rationalization care time justify search alternative emergency partial endodontic treatment . In current practice , short course oral corticotherapy use management oral pain inflammatory origin . Glucocorticoids , thanks anti-inflammatory action , neutralize inflammatory mediator thus pain . The pulp inflammation treat molecule : effectiveness intraosseous local steroid injection irreversible pulpitis mandibular molar already show result local comorbidities require specific device . Oral administration short-course prednisolone simple safe effectiveness manage pain cause irreversible pulpitis yet demonstrate . Per-os administration prednisolone high ( 90 % ) rapid ( â‰¤ 4 hour ) bioavailability . No difference effectiveness intravenous oral administration molecule report . This oral treatment could limit comorbidities technical difficulty relate intraosseous injection could delay endodontic treatment 72 hour optimal condition anesthesia patient . Despite difficulty describe partial endodontic treatment , effective pain reduction reach 100 % success . Therefore non-inferiority design choose compare effect short-course oral corticotherapy partial endodontic treatment reduction pain emergency care irreversible pulpitis mandibular molar . The intervention arm receive oral dose prednisolone ( 1 mg/kg ) emergency visit followed-up one morning dose day three day reference arm partial endodontic treatment . Both group plan complete endodontic treatment 72 hour enrolment .</brief_summary>
