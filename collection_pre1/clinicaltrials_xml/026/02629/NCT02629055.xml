	<brief_title>Respiratory EMG NIV Titration Stable COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Long-term application nocturnal non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient long controversial study result unequivocal . However , past 7 year , change ventilatory strategy , clear benefit chronic NIV show COPD patient chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure ( CHRF ) , though stable disease . As consequence , call high-intensity NIV , concept use higher positive inspiratory airway pressure ( IPAP ) level use old trial addition control ventilation higher backup breathe frequency aim maximal arterial carbon dioxide ( PaCO2 ) reduction , gain increase attention . However , unknown high-intensity NIV work , titrate optimal IPAP optimal backup breathe frequency . Measuring respiratory muscle activity might way titrate NIV COPD . Objective : The aim present study investigate whether additional titration surface electromyography ( EMG ) diaphragm intercostal muscle improve outcomes chronic NIV patient COPD stable CHRF term well gas exchange six week , lung function , patient comfort compliance less patient-ventilator asynchrony ( PVA ) . Study design : A randomized , two-armed , crossover trial compare regular titration additional respiratory EMG titration NIV stable hypercapnic COPD . One group initiate NIV accord standard care protocol . For group , additional EMG measure whilst NIV make titrate NIV . Protocol Regular NIV-set ( group ) Subjects initiate NIV accord local treatment protocol . NIV initiate registered nurse home mechanical ventilation ( HMV ) centre . Effectiveness measure transcutaneous measurement carbon dioxide ( PtCO2 ) . NIV supply pressure cycle ventilator , apply inspiratory airway pressure expiratory airway pressure patient ( BiPAP ; Synchrony , Respironics , incorporated. , Murrysville , USA ) . A nasal full face mask ( Mirage mask , ResMed Ltd , UK ) proper size use . The ventilator set spontaneous/ time mode ( S/T ) , backup frequency . If need O2 add obtain saturation â‰¥ 90 % . A humidifier ( HC 150 Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare , Australia ) use need . In general , nurse aim reach set high inspiratory pressure moderate breathe backup frequency , good patient comfort . Start study Patients include study use mask , sleep least 6 hour ventilator setting set usual daily clinical practice . This mean initial NIV setting optimize accord result overnight PtCO2 patient comfort . In daily practice , specialize nurse HMV centre already aim increase inspiratory pressure high pressure still comfortable patient , patient already high tolerable pressure . Once patient agree participate , 15-minute EMG measurement do patient ventilate setting particular moment . Furthermore , patient ask complete severe respiratory insufficiency ( SRI ) questionnaire . In `` nurse titrate NIV '' group , additional change make ventilatory setting . In `` EMG titrate NIV '' group , 15-minute EMG ventilatory setting set nurse , nurse decrease backup breathe frequency set ventilator step 2 breaths/min 8 breaths/min ( achieve pressure support mode ventilation ( completely trigger patient ) ) frequency 2 breaths/min spontaneous breathing frequency ventilator ( achieve control mode ventilation ) . Each frequency measure 10 minute , total titration take 60-80 minute . EMG measurement do throughout whole session analyze day . Then , set choose low EMG activity least PVA . The next night EMG measurement perform chosen setting . 6 week After 6 week , overnight EMG measurement repeat patient . Furthermore , nocturnal PtCO2 measurement perform , patient ask rate comfortable patient setting ask fill SRI , lung function assess number hour use per night read ventilator count reading . After measurement perform , patient direct titration arm . In patient initially titrate nurse , EMG frequency titration perform describe . In patient initially titrate additionally EMG , investigator reset ventilator setting apply nurse initially . 12 week After 12 week , nocturnal EMG measurement , nocturnal transcutaneous CO2 measurement , comfort score , SRI , lung function assessment compliance rating repeat patient .</detailed_description>
