	<brief_summary>There increase evidence large degree pathologic homology pancreas biliary tract . Indeed , biliary tract refer `` incomplete pancreas '' embryologically two originate structure . It thus plausible oncogenesis pancreas biliary tract relate pancreas biliary cancer reciprocal effective treatment strategy . To date , chemotherapeutic agent effective advanced biliary tract tumor combination gemcitabine cisplatin . Known approve therapy advance pancreas cancer include single agent gemcitabine , four drug combination FOLFIRINOX ( 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin , oxaliplatin , irinotecan ) , questionable limited benefit inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor pathway , recently combination gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel . Based promising result pancreas cancer , investigator hypothesize nab-paclitaxel combination gemcitabine + cisplatin effective cytotoxic combination BTC treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically document locally advanced metastatic BTC ( intrahepatic extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma , gallbladder cancer , ampullary carcinoma ) previously treat palliative systemic therapy radiation 2 . Unresectable disease base presence clinically and/or radiologically document measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 . Patients must measurable disease ; evaluable disease permit . 3 . ECOG performance status 0 1 . 4 . Age ≥ 18 year . 5 . Life expectancy least 3 month base discretion treat oncologist . 6 . Adequate hematologic function define follow laboratory parameter : Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Absolute granulocyte count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L 7 . Adequate hepatic renal function define follow laboratory parameter : AST ALT alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 X upper limit institutional normal ( ≤ 5 liver metastasis ) bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X upper limit institutional normal serum creatinine ≤ upper limit institutional normal OR calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min use CockcroftGault formula 8 . Patients may receive prior surgery surgery ≥ 4 week study entry patient must recover toxic effect treatment . 9 . Prothrombin time international normalize ratio ( PTINR ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) must within +/ 15 % normal range . 10 . Patients treat brain metastasis ( via local radiation standard surgical resection local ablative technique ) either steroid stable dose steroid least one month ( 30 day ) , AND anticonvulsant , AND radiological document stability lesion least 3 month may eligible . Each case discuss study Chair . 11 . Patients must ability read , understand , sign informed consent must willing comply study treatment followup . 12 . Female subject childbearing potential , define sexually mature woman 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy OR 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e . menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) must : either commit true abstinence agree use 2 physicianapproved contraceptive method ( oral , injectable , implantable hormonal contraceptive spermicide ; vasectomized partner ) clinical trial least 3 month follow last study medication ; negative serum pregnancy test ( βhCG ) result screen . Male subject must practice true abstinence agree use condom sexual contact pregnant female female childbearing potential participating study , dose interruption , 6 month follow study medication discontinuation , even undergone success vasectomy . 1 . Patients receive prior palliative chemotherapy advance BTC . 2 . Prior curative palliative radiation treatment pelvis radiation therapy ≥ 25 % bone marrow store . 3 . History bowel obstruction due peritoneal metastasis clinically document ascites require paracenteses . 4 . Previous concurrent malignancy , exclude curatively treat situ carcinoma cervix uterus nonmelanoma skin cancer insitu carcinoma prostate ( Gleason score ≤ 7 , treatment complete 6 month prior enrollment , unless least 5 year elapse since last treatment patient consider cure ) . 5 . Active bacterial , viral , fungal infection ( ) require systemic therapy , define ongoing signs/symptoms related infection without improvement despite appropriate antibiotic , antiviral therapy , and/or treatment . 6 . Known infection hepatitis B C , history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , subject receive immunosuppressive myelosuppressive medication would , opinion investigator , increase risk serious neutropenic complication . 7 . Any serious medical condition within 6 month prior study entry myocardial infarction , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , unstable angina , active cardiomyopathy , unstable ventricular arrhythmia , cerebrovascular disease , uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled psychiatric disorder , serious infection , active peptic ulcer disease , medical condition may aggravate treatment . 8 . Preexisting neuropathy ≥ grade 1 cause . 9 . Patients unstable metastasis central nervous system ( CNS ) . A CT scan MRI NOT require rule brain metastasis unless clinical suspicion CNS involvement . 10 . Pregnant lactating woman ; woman child bear potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day trial registration . Women men child bear potential must use effective contraception ( define treat physician ) must document study CRFs . 11 . History allergic reaction plan study medication . 12 . Patient ≥ 20 % decrease serum albumin level baseline visit , available , within 72 hour prior first study treatment dose . 13 . Patient coumadin . 14 . History interstitial lung disease . 15 . History connective tissue disorder ( e.g . lupus , scleroderma , polyarteritis nodosa ) . 16 . Enrollment clinical protocol investigational study interventional agent assessment may interfere study procedure . 17 . Any significant medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness , would prevent subject participate study , place subject unacceptable risk he/she participate study , condition confounds ability interpret data study .</criteria>
