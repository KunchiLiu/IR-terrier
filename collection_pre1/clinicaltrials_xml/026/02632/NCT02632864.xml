	<brief_summary>The standard treatment unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) sorafenib . Though TACE agent show survival benefit several randomized phase III trial , benefit modest . Recently , radiotherapy ( RT ) , especially conformal high dose advancement RT technique , show favorable response rate acceptable local control rate . Based promising result , RT actively apply HCC indicate surgery and/or radiofrequency ablation . Many researcher report relationship RT dose tumor response rate . RT dose , however , frequently limited complication ( like radiation induce liver disease ( RILD ) , radiation induce gastro-duodenal toxicity , etc . ) also closely related high expose RT dose . Proton beam characteristic depth-dose distribution contrast photon , `` Bragg peak '' . The advantage dose distribution could highlight HCC management , weakness maintenance importance liver function HCC patient . In fact , superior result proton beam therapy HCC constantly report several group prospectively well retrospectively . In background , investigator plan present study evaluate efficacy safety proton beam therapy HCC patient indicate surgery and/or radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) .</brief_summary>
