	<brief_summary>This clinical study evaluate side effect , quality life cancer control patient prostate cancer diagnose one side prostate gland . The diagnosis unilateral prostate cancer make mean prostate transperineal template biopsy ( TTB ) multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI ) . Patients treat low dose rate brachytherapy , use permanent iodine seed implants.Treatment limit side gland cancer diagnose therefore call `` focal '' brachytherapy . Prostate brachytherapy usually apply whole prostate gland . After whole gland prostate brachytherapy urinary , bowel sexual function may affect . In focal approach , side effect evaluate mean patient questionnaires.These repeat various interval treatment.The result compare questionnaire respond patient undergone whole gland brachytherapy.Therefore assessment make whether focal therapy produce few side effect whole gland brachytherapy.The observation period last two year treatment . A biopsy mpMRI repeat two year evaluate prostate cancer control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot Stage IIS study evaluate feasibility performing large multicentre trial.The HAPpy study prospective development study offer hemi ablative LDR brachytherapy 34 men histologically proven low intermediate risk localise prostate adenocarcinoma affect single lobe prostate.The data obtain 34 patient compare matched patient retrospective cohort whole gland brachytherapy patient treat institution.Precise mapping characterisation disease establish use mp-MRI ( T2-weighted DCE ( gadolinium ) ) image transperineal template biopsy ( TTB ) . Only lobes disease ( leave right half gland ) treat provided contralateral side free disease . Patients follow two year post treatment time mp-MRI TTB confirm disease control outcomes . Focal therapy prostate cancer new idea consider experimental treatment need evaluate within carefully conduct clinical trial . Rather investigate focal therapy strict sense know area disease treat , conservative approach need take information obtain regard outcome change treatment technique . Hemi-ablative focal therapy consider low-risk treatment investigation performance technique provide pathway future investigation less conservative methodology . Hemi-ablative focal therapy treat half prostate gland treatment margin , effectively treat least 50 % whole gland prescription dose . In theory , lessen side effect associated radical treatment still maintain disease control.This type treatment suitable patient unilateral disease . An international group expert establish form consensus design conduct LDR focal brachytherapy program clinical trial . The group 's finding publish Langley et al dosimetric model study Al Qaisieh et al . Focal hemi gland brachytherapy deliver mean adaptation real-time planning technique ( denominated 4D Brachytherapy ) use deliver whole gland LDR prostate brachytherapy . Stranded iodine 125 source implanted periphery prostate gland loose iodine 125 source implant within central volume gland . Because plan dosimetry do real-time , radiotherapy physic able adhere strict planning protocol require study . Treatment planning : For standard whole-gland treatment , whole prostate gland delineate form Planning Target Volume ( PTV ) V100 plan cover entire PTV plus 0.5cm margin . For hemi-ablative focal treatment , prostate divide half new HTV ( call HemiTreatment Volume ) outline side prostate determine clinically significant disease . A treatment margin 0.5cm consider around HTV , similar plan whole-gland treatment . In way , &gt; 95 % HTV aim receive 100 % prescription dose ( V100 ) . The V150 situate semi-horseshoe shape order spare urethra high dos radiation . Dose parameter critical organ follow : - HEMI PROSTATE : Prescription Dose 145Gy V100 = &gt; 95 % V150 = 50-60 % D90 = 140 - 160 Gy URETHRA : V150 &lt; 15 % RECTUM : D0.1cc &lt; 200 Gy The trial design follow recommendation publish Balliol Collaboration Idea , Development , Exploration , Assessment , Long-termfollow-up ( IDEAL ) model surgical study . Data Collection Statistics 1 . Sample Size- Pilot Study There publish result available technique trialled determine effectiveness disease control quality life outcomes . As , preliminary study necessary determine efficacy feasibility large , multi-centre trial perform significant number patient recruited appropriate statistical analysis . The trial site currently treat ~300 patient per year whole-gland brachytherapy . Of 300 patient , ~25 % present unilateral disease low intermediate risk . Recruitment 18 month , time 100 patient eligible HAPpy trial . We anticipate 25 % drop-out rate mp- MRI TPM biopsy result 25 % drop-out due refusal participate . This mean ~50 patient available recruitment study 18 month period . In order ass decrease side-effects ( base quality life ( QoL ) ) data least 10 % , 34 patient require study . This compare two independent group ( prospective hemi group versus retrospective whole-gland group ) use α = 5 % , β = 10 % , σ = 20 % . 2 . Data collection The main research co-ordinator qualify experienced data manager . Data collect paper electronic form data store one place back twice two different server . Data hold accord Data Protection Act 1998 pseudo anonymised necessary . Each participant give study number use study record . The patient number know chief investigator , research co-ordinator , research radiographer nurse assign study . Data keep secure manner research office access name individual study group . The paper record keep minimum 10 year end study . A research radiographer nurse appoint time trial commencement ensure Quality Life ( QOL ) questionnaires complete follow-up visit require trial protocol . The research radiographer nurse also responsible ensure patient trial appropriate appointment set treatment , scan ( mp-MRI , biopsy ) , follow-up visit necessary information collect visit protocol . All clinic visit information include questionnaire , scan , biopsy result , blood result keep study record . 3 . Analysis Thirty-four patient examine HAPpy trial small sample number , non-parametric analysis data suitable . Patients pair matched accord tumour stag pathology , age , baseline score . The Mann-Whitney U test , Wilcoxon test , well test normality ( appropriate ) data perform determine difference trial group . Analysis variance perform data appropriate use manner . Data collect : - IPSS + QoL questionnaire = Numerical score , time-points IIEFF-5 QoL questionnaire = Numerical score , time-points EORTC QoL 30 , PR25 bowel symptom questionnaire = Numerical score , time-points Dosimetry Values PTV HTV = Numerical V100 , V150 , D90 = Numerical Dose Urethra ( V150 ) = Numerical Dose Rectum ( D0.1cc ) = Numerical Pathology review biopsy ( ) Standard reporting , qualitative , rank mm core invade = Numerical Biopsy % core invade = Numerical PSA = Numerical , time-points EN2 = Numerical , time-points Gleason Score= Numerical Staging = Standard reporting , qualitative , rank Outcomes report estimate 95 % confidence interval use appropriate method base type data . For patient report outcomes available baseline measurement , comparison make baseline value use paired analysis . Logistic regression use investigate association potential risk factor histological failure , consider PSA EN2 , Gleason score , cancer core length involvement ( mm % ) , number % positive biopsy cancer TTB , stage risk group . Sensitivity specificity ( 95 % confidence interval ) estimate consider use standard PSA kinetics threshold identify clinically significant cancer . Scores quality life questionnaire use multivariable cross-sectional longitudinal regression analysis compare treatment group . Dosimetric evaluation PTV , HTV , structure ( urethra , rectum , bladder ) perform ( ultrasound real-time plan post-operative CT ) . The dosimetry correlate QoL information disease control outcomes .
