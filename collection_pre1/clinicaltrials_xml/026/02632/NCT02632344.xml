	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Pembrolizumab specific disease approve us . Pembrolizumab humanize monoclonal antibody . Pembrolizumab study several clinical trial see effect help immune system recognize eliminate abnormal cell body . The antibody block receptor express immune cell , call T cell , block receptor potential activate T cell kill abnormal cell , virally infected cell . In research study , investigator look whether Pembrolizumab restore natural ability immune system recognize eliminate Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -infected cell body .</detailed_description>

The latter require 3 surgery within year remove lesion larynx . Subjects must evaluable disease either base RECIST 1.1 and/or endoscopic parameter , discuss . Be require provide tissue newly obtain biopsy tumor lesion . Newlyobtained defined specimen obtain 6 week ( 42 day ) prior study registration . Subjects newlyobtained sample provide ( e.g . inaccessible subject safety concern ) may submit archived specimen upon agreement PI . Have confirm human papillomavirusassociated lesion base insitu hybridization test and/or polymerase chain reaction may perform newly obtain biopsy archive sample . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . Demonstrate adequate organ function define Table 1 , screen lab perform within 10 day study registration System Laboratory Value Hematological Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Renal Serum creatinine OR Measured calculateda creatinine clearance ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant . Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant . Creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 5.7.2 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . The method surgical sterilization include hysterectomy ( removal uterus ) , bilateral oophorectomy ( removal ovary ) , tubal ligation ( tubes tie ) , transvaginal occlusion ( block tube coil ) . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior study registration . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study registration recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study registration recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Recovery effect major surgery significant traumatic injury least 28 day first dose study treatment . Endoscopic debridement RRP lesion NOT consider major surgery No know diagnosis invasive squamous cell carcinoma within previous 2 year . Has know malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow .</criteria>
