	<brief_summary>This non-randomized phase 1 trial design determine MTD evaluate safety tolerability ACY-1215 nab-paclitaxel . Based activity profile ACY-1215 breast cancer , correspond biomarker availability HDAC6 MR score , potential synergy taxanes , data support rationale test ability ACY-1215 improve response rate patient metastatic breast cancer combination standard taxane chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common female cancer second common cause death woman . Women hormone receptor-negative tumor associate symptomatic visceral metastasis , hormone receptor-positive tumor refractory endocrine therapy require cytotoxic chemotherapy disease control . The standard care patient metastatic breast cancer include single agent taxane-based chemotherapy . Combination chemotherapy generally provide high rate objective response long time progression , compare single-agent chemotherapy . However , associate increase toxicity little survival benefit . There remain unmet need combination regimens incorporate new , effective oftentimes less toxic targeted agent together standard chemotherapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects histologically confirm adenocarcinoma breast breast cancer subtypes allow . 2 . Unresectable metastatic breast cancer . Locally recurrent disease must amenable local treatment curative intent . Metastatic disease must demonstrate either radiographically histologically . 3 . Patients may measurable disease , nonmeasurable disease , ( RECIST 1.1 ) . 4 . ECOG performance status 01 . 5 . Must recover acute toxic effect prior therapy prior registration study grade 1 less . 6 . Women men race ethnic group eligible trial . 7 . Minimum number prior treatment require give standard nabpaclitaxel dosing : If HER2 negative : none If HER2 positive : two prior regimen contain HER2 target therapy inoperable locally advanced and/or metastatic setting . Prior therapy inoperable locally advanced/metastatic disease include trastuzumab plus pertuzumab well adotrastuzumab . Pertuzumab adotrastuzumab must previously use , unless reason include , limited , follow : intolerance pertuzumab and/or adotrastuzumab , medical contraindication , regimen decline patient , treat investigator discretion , medical insurance coverage issue prevent administration pertuzumab adotrastuzumab . These reason must review study chair document medical record care report form . Patients relapse within 12 month complete neoadjuvant/adjuvant pertuzumab adotrastuzumab would consider progressed regimen . There maximum number prior treatment allow metastatic setting . 8 . Age &gt; 18 year . Because breast carcinoma disease adult rarely occur child , child exclude study . 9 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min 10 . Subject capable understanding informed consent process . 11 . The effect ACY1215 develop human fetus unknown . For reason effect chemotherapy know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 2 week completion ACY1215 administration . 1 . Patients chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Concomitant treatment bonetargeted therapy RANKL inhibitor bisphosphonates allow . 2 . Patients receive investigational agent concurrently receive investigational agent within 2 week 5 halflives compound active metabolite , whichever long first dose study treatment . 3 . Patients receive HDAC inhibitor ( include valproic acid , entinostat , vorinostat ) exclude 4 . Subject pregnant nursing . Pregnant woman exclude study ACY1215 investigational therapy unknown potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ACY1215 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated ACY1215 . 5 . Symptomatic unstable brain metastasis . ( Note : Asymptomatic patient metastatic brain disease stable dose corticosteroid treatment brain metastasis least 14 day prior registration eligible participate study ) . 6 . HIV+ CD4 count &lt; 200 ineligible patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 7 . Patients receive medication substance strong inhibitor CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme . 8 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition nabpaclitaxel . 9 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 10 . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) value &gt; 480 msec screening ; family personal history long QTc syndrome ventricular arrhythmia include ventricular bigeminy screening ; previous history druginduced QTc prolongation need treatment medication know suspected produce prolonged QTc interval electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . If QTc prolongation screen ECG felt related electrolyte imbalance , EKG repeat correction electrolyte .</criteria>
