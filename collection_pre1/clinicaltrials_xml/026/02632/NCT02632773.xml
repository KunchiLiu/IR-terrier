	<detailed_description>High dosage early intervention critical language skill development young child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) include parent cost-effective approach maximize intervention dosage . However , parent-mediated intervention inconsistent effect parent child outcomes . This variability likely parent train clinician little effort spend examine parent characteristic may influence ability implement different type intervention strategy . Given known cognitive , personality language feature present among many parent child ASD , examine relationship learning style parent implementation different parent-mediated intervention strategy important first step identify potential source variability parent-mediated intervention outcome . The objective propose study examine parent learn style influence parent use language intervention strategy subsequent child language skill . The central hypothesis parent learn style associate : ( ) differential use language intervention strategy ( b ) child language skill . The specific aim include determine extent : ( ) parent learn style type parent-mediated intervention associate mother use language intervention strategy subsequent child language skill , ( b ) parent learn style moderate relationship intervention type mother use language intervention strategy , ( c ) parent learn style associate use language intervention strategies child 's language skill . The propose study enroll 108 child ASD 24 36 month age mother . Mother-child dyad randomly assign one two parent-mediated intervention strategy contrast theoretical approach ( responsive-developmental , directive-behavioral ) . Mother-child dyad assess randomization ( pre-test ) , intervention ( post-test ) 3 month end intervention monitor maintenance . Children group receive 8 weekly intervention session home use experimental procedure . The propose research significant first examination impact parent learn style parent child outcomes two different parent-mediated intervention strategy ( directive , responsive ) . Understanding effect parent learn style parent use intervention strategy subsequent child language skill key step customize parent-mediated intervention base parent characteristic . The long-term positive effect propose research improve language outcomes intervention child autism tailor parent-mediated intervention capitalize parental strength .</detailed_description>
