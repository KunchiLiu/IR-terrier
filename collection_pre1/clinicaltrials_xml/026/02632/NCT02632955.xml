	<detailed_description>Hemodialysis ( HD ) remain prevalent form RRT patient End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) . Just United States 380,000 patient ESRD hemodialysis ( HD ) number expect increase 500,000 year 2020 . Recent data provide Saudi Centre Organ Transplantation ( www.scot.org.sa ) show 13000 patient End-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) hemodialysis Kingdom Saudi Arabia . This number expect rise rate 7-8 % annually reach 18000 year 2018 . Establishing viable vascular access crucial consider 'life-line ' patient . Loss dysfunction vascular access significant contributor morbidity ESRD patient HD . In United States &lt; 50 % hemodialysis access remain patent 3 year economic burden maintain vascular access patency calculate exceed $ 1 billion &gt; 6 % annual trend . The National Kidney Foundation 's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( KDOQI ) guideline suggest ESRD patient initiate dialysis function permanent vascular access arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) prefer arteriovenous graft ( AVG ) . Central venous catheter ( CVC ) least preferred vascular access HD due complication associate . Despite recommendation clear benefit use arteriovenous access hemodialysis , 80 % patient start dialysis CVC . One reason low AVF rate early fistula failure ( EFF ) . EFF define AVF never develop adequately dialysis ( failure mature ) fail within 3 month start dialysis . An adequate AVF dialysis accord KDOQI guideline one ) Has flow great 600ml/min , b ) Has diameter 0.6cm great c ) Is approximately deep 0.6cm skin surface . Between 23 % -46 % newly construct AVF problem early failure result dismal one year patency 60-65 % . In order devise strategy prevent EFF , one need understand physiology fistula maturation . Creation AVF lead immediate increase flow vein due pressure gradient create . This increase flow lead increase wall shear stress define mathematically formula 4ηQ/πr3 , η blood viscosity , Q blood flow r vessel radius . Shear stress thus directly proportional blood flow inversely proportional vessel diameter . After creation AVF , flow mediate increase shear stress mitigate vessel dilatation biological mediator . Consequently shear stress bring back pre-anastomosis level lead vessel dilation . It seem positive remodel vein lead AVF maturation dependent increase blood flow rather increase pressure . Any pathology affect blood flow newly construct AVF thus lead failure mature . The two important cause EFF amenable intervention stenosis anywhere circuit ( present around 80 % EFF ) and/or presence accessory vein . While stenosis development pathological accessory vein presence natural , lead decrease blood flow main AVF circuit , may responsible failure mature . Addressing two entity timely fashion lead salvage many AVF , otherwise would abandon . Development neo-intimal hyperplasia ( NIH ) main pathology cause stenosis AVF circuit . There many factor think responsible development NIH . These include turbulent flow wall shear stress disturbance , uremic endothelial dysfunction , repeat venipuncture , unique anatomic factor . The pathogenesis include migration smooth muscle cell myofibroblasts medium intima , neoangiogenesis microvessels inside neointima , high level inflammatory blood marker . Since introduction , endovascular approach show high rate technical success treatment stenotic lesion relate HD arteriovenous access . Percutaneous balloon angioplasty ( PBA ) consider treatment choice lesion . Despite good technical immediate success PBA poor long term outcomes recurrence rate 60-70 % 6 month . One reason could damage cause angioplasty lead intima-media rupture promote cascade event lead development NIH . Recently use covered stent time angioplasty show well patency rate 6 month still optimal . Lately idea deliver loco-regional pharmacological agent time angioplasty prevent NIH happen extensively study mostly coronary artery . This lead development drug elute stent drug elute balloon ( DEB ) . These therapy show considerable advantage clinical trial relate coronary peripheral arterial disease . Although promising advantage coronary peripheral artery may applicable arteriovenous access lesion mostly venous different characteristic . The role costly intervention need address stenosis relate AVF , wide spread use recommend . In recent randomize non-blinded study involve 40 patient , Kostanos et al show good 6 month patency rate ( 70 % vs 25 % ) DEB angioplasty compare standard PBA . The study non-blinded involved AVG AVF target lesion spread arteriovenous access circuit . Patane et al recently perform study 26 fail radiocephalic AVF 's juxta-anastamosis stenosis , define stenosis within 3 cm arteriovenous anastamosis . In study DEB angioplasty show 6 month primary patency 96.1 % much high historical conventional balloon angioplasty . The investigator target lesion resembles closely arterial lesion DEB show effective , seem reasonable control study . Due lack control group high patency rate become questionable . Nevertheless study highlight importance randomize control trial target specific lesion . In controlled pilot study radio-cephalic AVF inflow stenosis Lai et al Taiwan show short term patency benefit DEB angioplasty compare standard PBA . This pilot study 20 patient adequately power answer question . If result indeed proven true , lead great improvement patency AVF 's . In randomized control trial researcher plan assess efficacy DEB angioplasty compare standard PBA AVF 's EFF .</detailed_description>
