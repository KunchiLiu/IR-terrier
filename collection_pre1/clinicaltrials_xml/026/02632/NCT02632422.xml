	<brief_title>AIH-induced Walking Recovery After Subacute SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study determine whether repeatedly breathe low oxygen level brief period ( term acute intermittent hypoxia ( AIH ) ) improve recovery walk spinal cord injury . This idea stem animal study respiration , investigator show mild AIH improve breathe rat spinal injury . These study show AIH induces plasticity , strengthen neural connection increase production key proteins improve sensitivity spinal cord circuitry . The ultimate goal research assess potential mild AIH therapeutic approach person chronic spinal cord injury also person subacute injury . By apply AIH early stage recovery , investigator hope expand potential benefit AIH broad range person spinal injury , thereby improve functional independence quality life serviceman civilian .</detailed_description>
