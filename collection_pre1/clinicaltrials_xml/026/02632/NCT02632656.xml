	<brief_title>Plasma ExtrAcellular RNAs Biomarkers Heart FaiLure During Decongestion : PEARL-HF Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly 5 million people United States congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Although medical therapy beta-blockers , angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , angiotensin-receptor blocker ( ARBs ) aldosterone antagonists improved prognosis , overall rate hospital admission continue rise last decade mortality patient symptomatic heart failure remain bad majority cancer country . Accordingly , significant opportunity exist improvement outcome patient CHF , morbidity mortality standpoint . Such opportunity may lie outpatient medical management patient CHF . In study , primary objective measure association extracellular RNA ( ex-RNA ) level plasma patient receive aggressive outpatient therapy CHF ( 1 ) cardiac remodeling ( 2 ) cardiovascular event . The investigator follow patient standard medical therapy CHF ass change ex-RNA level plasma , associate cardiac remodeling ( cardiac imaging ) outcomes .</detailed_description>
