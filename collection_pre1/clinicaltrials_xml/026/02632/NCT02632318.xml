	<brief_summary>One physiologically demand thing old people every day get morning . After spend night lay flat , blood distributes evenly across body , stand morning ( blood rush foot ) , cardiovascular system may able compensate maintain blood flow brain . This phenomenon know orthostatic postural hypotension . The investigator find group young individual use dawn-simulation light gradually wake brain able increase cardiovascular tone prior arise . The goal experiment determine whether dawn simulation light able increase cardiovascular tone older adult would reduce absent postural hypotension awaken morning . This would greatly reduce risk fall associated morbidity older adult .</brief_summary>
