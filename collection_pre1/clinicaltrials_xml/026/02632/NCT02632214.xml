	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate cerebral asymmetry face process group profoundly deaf participant group hearing control mean fMRI measure . To end , present chimeric face ( face split different half ) , entire face , face present divided visual field , subject perform gender categorization task lie fMRI scanner . It expect find reduced cerebral asymmetry Fusiform Face Area deaf comparison hear participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A rightward asymmetry face process well document hearing participant , particular Fusiform Face Area , cortical area underlie face processing . This rightward asymmetry seem robust , present even invert face line drawing , already present five year age . If brain asymmetry face processing emerge development , early deprivation dramatic difference infant 's experience world affect . For example , infant treat bilateral congenital cataract 7 week age , deprive pattern visual input duration , fail develop aspect associate typical adult level face recognition . Non visual early deprivation also affect development visual ability . Several study show deaf participant could detect target large eccentricity , thus indicate large visual field . Furthermore , good ability find deaf participant detection motion , particular visual periphery . Higher-level visual ability also show modify early deafness , visual imagery ( image generation , rotation ) processing face . Using Benton Test Facial Recognition , previous study test recognition individual face deaf participant . They obtain good score hear non signer , difficult condition , face shadow . This enhance processing deaf people could thus concern particular aspect face processing ; find deaf normal hearing differed detection subtle facial feature . Investigating configural processing face perception , find increase dependency mode process deaf participant . If visual processing affect early deafness , visual asymmetry ? Several experimental study examine hemispheric asymmetry congenitally deaf individual find differs one observe hearing individual . Concerning face processing , study investigate hemispheric lateralization perception face deaf people . When present briefly unfamiliar face either leave right visual field difference deaf hear participant find . In previous experiment , use chimeric face ( face vertically split two different part , ie half male , half female ) find reduction leftward asymmetry face process deaf participant gender categorization task . The aim present study broaden knowledge asymmetry face process deaf people , evaluate reduction asymmetry observe behavioral level result reduction cerebral asymmetry level Fusiform Face Area . Deaf participant normal hearing control present face stimulus , compose either chimeric male/female female/male face , entire face entire face present divide visual field , investigate Fusiform Face Area asymmetry two group . Participants lie fMRI scanner , cerebral activity record perform gender categorization task face stimulus .</detailed_description>
