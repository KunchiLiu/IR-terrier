	<detailed_description>Preoperative anaemia common ( â‰ˆ30 % ) patient await cardiac surgery , associate increased complication , ICU hospital stay , mortality . The extent anaemia worsen haemodilution occur cardiopulmonary bypass surgical bleeding ( average blood loss 0.5-1.5 litre ) , turn impair end-organ blood flow tissue oxygen delivery . Further , need blood transfusion greatly increase anaemic patient , associate poor outcome . In addition , blood transfusion costly ( &gt; $ 700 per unit ) , around 50 % transfusion use surgery cardiac surgery . The investigator identify high rate bleed complication transfusion requirement Australian cardiac surgery ; another international collaboration , find anaemia , transfusion kidney injury inter-related cardiac surgery . After risk-adjustment , combination three risk factor associate 3.5-fold ( 95 % CI 2.3-5.2 ) increase odds kidney injury . Both anaemia red cell transfusion independent risk factor major surgery . Some investigator review Australian cardiac surgery patient six Victorian hospital , 2005-2011 . We link ANZ Society Cardiothoracic Surgeons cardiac surgery database laboratory data , include preoperative haemoglobin issue blood product ( manuscript preparation ) . Anaemia define accord WHO definition ( Hb &lt; 130 g/L male &lt; 120 g/L female ) . There 15,948 cardiac surgery patient available inclusion analysis , 28 % anaemic . Anaemic patient likely receive red cell transfusion ( 71 % vs. 40 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) , transfuse unit blood ( median 4 [ IQR 2-8 ] vs. 3 [ 2-5 ] , p &lt; 0.001 ) , high 30-day mortality ( 5.4 % vs. 1.9 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) , new renal failure ( 43 % vs. 26 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) , long hospital stay survivor ( 13 day [ 8-23 ] vs. 8 day [ 6-14 ] , p &lt; 0.001 ) . After multivariable adjustment , preoperative anaemia independent predictor mortality ( adj . OR 1.46 , 95 % CI 1.14-1.88 , p=0.003 ) . Similar result obtain restricted elective surgery , hospital stay 9 day ( 7-17 ) vs. 7 day ( 6-11 ) , p &lt; 0.001 . Other large study consistent . The investigator also analyse data patient undergoing major non-cardiac surgery American College Surgeons ' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database ( validate outcomes registry 211 hospital worldwide ) . In 227,425 patient undergoing noncardiac surgery , find preoperative anaemia associate increase 30-day mortality ( adj . OR 1.42 , 95 % CI 1.31-1.54 ) morbidity ( adj . OR 1.35 , 1.30-1.40 ) . Alfred hospital ( Melbourne ) transfusion data 2012-14 ( n=2,091 ) show anaemic ( 27 % cohort ) non-anaemic cardiac surgical patient intraoperative red cell transfusion rate 31 % 14 % , respectively ; p &lt; 0.01 . Iron deficiency commonest cause anaemia worldwide , iron deficiency per se independently worsen outcome surgery . The traditional textbook definition iron deficiency anaemia refers depletion body 's iron store due dietary deficiency chronic blood loss - absolute iron deficiency . Chronic disease inflammation direct effect pathway iron absorption metabolism lead state functional iron deficiency anaemia . Specifically , iron regulatory protein hepcidin upregulated , block pathway iron transport . This prevent iron absorption gut , uptake reticuloendothelial system increase store ( ferritin ) , distribution transfer bone marrow block . Consequently , despite normal even increase body iron store ( normal ferritin level ) , artifactual , state 'functional iron deficiency ' exists . This commonly see renal cardiac disease increasingly recognise cause anaemia surgical patient . Importantly , IV iron show overcome functional deficiency correct anaemia . IV iron therapy effective treating anaemia medical ( heart failure , kidney disease ) , post-partum , preoperative setting ( orthopaedic surgery , colon cancer resection , hysterectomy , hip/knee joint replacement . Earlier IV iron preparation use high molecular weight dextran associate anaphylaxis due pre-formed antibody , new preparation safer , enable delivery full treatment dose 15 min , iron administer safely quickly outpatient . It readily available Australia PBS-listed . This give patient equivalent dose 12 month tablet 15 min . Iron deficiency common patient coronary artery surgery . It highly plausible anaemia correction improve patient outcome follow cardiac surgery.However , data suggest free iron mediates free radical production associate organ damage infection surgery balance effective anaemia correction potential risk need research . A definitive large trial need determine IV iron safely , effectively , promptly correct preoperative anaemia , thus reduces risk cardiac surgery . The investigator undertake Cochrane review iron therapy treat anaemia adult include 4,745 participant 21 trial . This find trend well haemoglobin level IV iron ( MD 0.50 g/dL , 95 % CI 0.73-0.27 ; six study , N=769 ) considerable , unexplained heterogeneity . Differences proportion participant require transfusion imprecise ( RR 0.84 , 95 % CI 0.66-1.06 ; 8 study , N=1,315 ) . Thus current evidence base sparse ; randomise trial do small - remain considerable equipoise . Review literature anaemia iron therapy cardiac surgery , include 4 small trial IV iron . Overall , half cardiac surgery patient anaemic surgery . Preoperative anaemia find independently associate high mortality blood transfusion rate , well longer ICU hospital stay . As also show others , preoperative haematocrit powerful independent predictor mortality , renal failure deep sternal wound infection . In adjusted analysis 5 point decrease preoperative haematocrit associate 8 % increase risk death ( OR , 1.08 ; p &lt; 0.0003 ) , 22 % increase risk postoperative renal failure ( OR , 1.22 ; p &lt; 0.0001 ) , 10 % increase risk deep sternal wound infection ( OR , 1.10 ; p &lt; 0.01 ) . There need well-designed , pragmatic trial ass role preoperative anaemia treatment use IV iron patient undergoing cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
