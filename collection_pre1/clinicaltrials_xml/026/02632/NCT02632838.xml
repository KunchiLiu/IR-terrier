	<brief_summary>Monitoring self-management important component effective chronic disease care improve patient outcome . With rapid development integration mobile health technology ( mHealth ) health care delivery service , mHealth intervention provide great opportunity improve efficiency chronic disease management . However , little known whether mHealth intervention effectively impact health health care outcomes underserved population . This pilot study assess preliminary effectiveness mobile-based health intervention urban underserved community high incidence hypertension . It hypothesize patient hypertension experience improve outcome due use mHealth application compare patient use application . The finding study advance understanding utility mHealth intervention among underserved population generate evidence support new health care delivery approach underserved urban community . In study , three hypothesis test : 1 . Hypertension patient use mHealth application exhibit great decrease blood pressure well maintenance 6-month period compare receive standard care . 2 . Hypertension patient use mHealth application exhibit effective self-management compare receive standard care . 3 . Utilizing mHealth application help nurse monitor hypertension status effectively monitor hypertension status without mHealth application .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improve Hypertension Monitoring Self-management Using mHealth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A mixed study design utilized . This study two step , implementation evaluation . In implementation , pilot version randomize control trial ( RCT ) utilize examine BP decline BP maintenance 30 participant assign either standard care treatment ( standard follow-up group ) standard care plus mHealth ( mHealth group ) . In evaluation , improve quality life , patient self‐efficacy , great treatment adherence , reduce hospital utilization , health provider ' feedback assess survey group interview . Step 1 : Implementation A pilot version randomize control trial ( RCT ) utilize examine hypothesis 1 . A parallel-group 6-month study design utilize , 30 participant randomly assign either standard follow-up group mHealth group . Jordan &amp; Harris Community Health Center 's ( J &amp; HCHC ) nurse help identify random select patient , nurse blind study , nurse keep monitoring patient group . Based J &amp; HCHC 's current practice , hypotension patient require visit nurse regular hypertension care every week . Therefore , participant study ask visit J &amp; HCHC week 6-month period usual . The standard follow-up group receive regular hypertension care usual consist : nursing assessment , medication management , patient education , follow continue care . Home monitoring great way help detect monitor high blood pressure . The mHealth group ask use iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor daily basis HOME also ask visit J &amp; HCHC week receive regular hypertension care 6-month period usual . After participant complete 6-month study , study data collect Electronic Health Record ( McKesson ) patient 's mobile device . In study , FDA 510K approve device , iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor ( iHealth Lab Inc. ) , utilized mHealth group . This fully automatic wrist cuff blood pressure monitor use oscillometric principle measure blood pressure pulse rate . The monitor work mobile device test , track share vital blood pressure data . There physical risk associate use device take blood pressure home . Besides FDA 510K approval , iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor also CE medical certification ( Europe ) ESH Certification ( European Society Hypertension ) . iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor work Apple Android device . Apple iOS device require iOS version 5.0 high Android device require operate system 3.0 later . iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor maintain maximum 10,000 measurement three year usage . In addition , iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor Bluetooth sync system pair Apple Android device . The synchronization allow monitor send systolic diastolic blood pressure pulse rate patient ' mobile device . The free iHealth MyVitals app automatically keeps history BP data give patient option share blood pressure data information healthcare provider . In addition keep data mobile device , patient also receive free secure cloud account . Vital data cloud allow patient access computer share reading healthcare provider , choose . With type information available , patient able self-management nurse able actively provide intervention activity . Conceptual diagram iHealth BP-7 Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor device , apps cloud sever present research protocol Step 2 : Evaluation The outcome evaluation study immediately start 6-month implementation step complete . The evaluation conduct patient nurse . During evaluation step , Hypothesis 2 3 test . For hypothesis 2 improve quality life , patient self‐efficacy , great treatment adherence , reduce hospital utilization evaluate Short Form ( 36 ) Health Survey ( SF‐36 ) Medication Adherence Self‐Efficacy Scale ( MASES ) . All participate patient ask complete two survey ; completion two survey approximately 10- 15 minute . For hypothesis 3 , hypertension status monitoring experience feedbacks health provider assess administer group interview five community nurse . This group interview also immediately conduct implementation step complete . This group interview approximately 90 minute . Study principal investigator co-principal investigator lead group interview . A group interview guide use guide process , entire interview audiotaped digital recorder , transcribed .</detailed_description>
