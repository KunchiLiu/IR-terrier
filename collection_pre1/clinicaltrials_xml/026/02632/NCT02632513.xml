	<detailed_description>Title : Effect passive ultrasonic irrigation success primary endodontic treatment Introduction : It well establish apical periodontitis cause due microbial invasion root canal space . It inflammatory disease process comprise host response infection root canal system affect tooth . So , become important render root canal free microorganism pathological debris treat apical periodontitis . Mechanical instrumentation play important role remove microorganism root canal system incapable render canal completely free bacteria . The intricacy root canal system fin , isthmus , apical ramification hinder complete debridement area inaccessible mechanical instrumentation . These complexity continue harbour bacteria , necrotic tissue debris result persistent periapical inflammation . Thus adjunctive use root canal irrigant become important . Mechanical cleaning root canal aid antimicrobial irrigation , thus , two key element help reduce bacterial load root canal treat apical periodontitis . Irrigation form integral part chemomechanical preparation facilitate removal bacteria , debris necrotic tissue , especially area beyond reach root canal instrument . Sodium hypochlorite recommend main irrigant root canal treatment antimicrobial efficacy well tissue-dissolving capacity effectiveness root canal depend irrigant 's penetration along full length canal irrigant exchange . Although conventional syringe delivery well accept technique irrigation delivers solution 0-1.1 mm beyond needle tip thereby limit irrigant penetration . In addition air entrapment apical third produce vapor lock effect , thus impede flow irrigant apical region adequate debridement canal system.16 Previous study show root canal still detectable level cultivable bacteria follow chemomechanical procedure sodium hypochlorite irrigant . Consequently , different irrigant agitation technique propose increase clean efficacy , mechanically chemically , enhance irrigation dynamic . One technique ultrasonic activation root canal irrigant . Passive ultrasonic irrigation first describe Weller et al.The file design oscillate ultrasonic frequency 25-30kHz operate transverse vibration , set characteristic pattern node antinode along length . It enhance irrigant canal wall interaction transmit acoustic energy oscillate instrument irrigant , cause acoustic microstreaming transient cavitation . Generally ultrasonic activation irrigation solution syringe use inject irrigant root canal , irrigant activate passively ultrasonically oscillate instrument . Nascent chlorine , active component responsible tissue dissolve antimicrobial action hypochlorite , consume rapidly case . Further , amount irrigant activate small , thereby , limit debridement efficacy . It , therefore , suggest irrigant delivery method provide continuous replenishment root canal irrigant may efficient . Recently , ultrasonic device introduce provide continuous irrigant delivery along ultrasonic activation . In device irrigate solution move needle syringe attach luer-lock connection needle activate delivered root canal . The main advantage technique continuous replenishment solution irrigate solution deliver needle activate state , avoid need insert needle apical third root canal . Studies show 1minute continuous ultrasonic irrigation hand rotary instrumentation result significantly clean canal isthmi mesial root mandibular molar . Carver et al show addition 1 minute continuous ultrasonic irrigation significantly reduce bacterial-positive culture . Another study report continuous ultrasonic irrigation effective intermittent ultrasonic irrigation placement irrigant apical part canal , lead improve irrigant penetration lateral canal . In vitro study compare continuous ultrasonic irrigation syringe irrigation removal debris report continuous ultrasonic irrigation effective debris removal apical third narrow isthmus . Curtis et al find continuous ultrasonic irrigation result significantly less debris present root canal 1 3 mm work length compare conventional needle irrigation.A recent study Layton et al report continuous ultrasonic irrigation generates high fluid velocity shear stress apical third result enhanced reduction strictly adherent bacterial biofilm compare intermittent ultrasonic irrigation syringe irrigation . Whether parameter translate well clinical outcome remain see . However , best knowledge , study assess effect irrigant activation use continuous ultrasonic device success endodontic treatment . This randomize controlled trial therefore design evaluate compare success endodontic treatment use continuous ultrasonic irrigation syringe irrigation . Methodology : The research project carry Department Conservative Dentistry Endodontics , Post Graduate Institute Dental Sciences , Rohtak ( Haryana ) . Protocol study approve institutional ethical committee ( PGIDS/IEC/2014/120 ) , Rohtak , India follow ethical guideline Helsinki declaration 1975 , revise 2000 . The study conduct May 2014 May 2015 . The study population comprise patient require endodontic treatment follow diagnosis pulpal necrosis chronic apical periodontitis mature mandibular molar . All patient examine establish eligibility study . Evaluation Pulp Vitality Pulp vitality status evaluate help electric pulp test , cold test clinical evaluation access opening . If patient respond electric thermal test , bleed observed access cavity preparation , subject include study provide inclusion criterion also meet . Radiographic examination All periapical radiograph expose 70 kVp machine ( Confident , Blue X Imaging S.r.l Via Idiomi 1/8-33 Assago , Italy ) use Rinn parallel device ( Dentsply Ltd. , Weybridge , Surrey , United Kingdom ) ; process manually . Data gathering Once eligibility confirm , study explain patient write consent participate study take . All diagnostic , intra operative post operative finding record proforma . Randomization The patient randomly assign one two treatment group : continuous ultrasonic irrigation ( CUI ) syringe irrigation ( SI ) , base use irrigation protocol utilized chemomechanical preparation . Subjects assign either CUI syringe irrigation group use equal proportion allocation ratio . Envelopes contain concealed assignment code assign sequentially eligible patient . Both patient operator blind treatment protocol completion chemomechanical preparation . Clinical Procedure The endodontic treatment complete two visit . First Visit Local anaesthesia administer ( 2 % lidocaine 1:80000 epinephrine ) patient comfort . The tooth isolate rubber dam . Caries excavate use round bur high speed handpiece copious irrigation access pulp chamber make . Working length ( WL ) obtain help electronic apex locator ( Root ZX ) use # 10 # 15 K file confirm radiographically . The canal enlarge size three size large first apical binding file work length 0.02 taper ISO stainless steel hand file , follow step-back technique successively large file place 0.5 mm coronal previous one . Canal patency maintain pass # 10 stainless steel file 0.5 1.0 mm beyond work length . In group , canal irrigate 5 mL 5.25 % sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl ) ( Hyposol ; Prevest Denpro Limited , Jammu , India ) solution every change instrument use 27 gauge needle . After shape , canal irrigate 5 mL 17 % EDTA ( Prevest Denpro Limited , Jammu , India ) 1 minute . Post instrumentation irrigation : In continuous ultrasonic irrigation group , Proultra PiezoFlow ( Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialties , Tulsa , OK ) use activation irrigate solution accord manufacturer 's recommendation . The needle operate use Satelec P5 Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Unit ( Acteon , Mount Laurel , NJ ) power set 5.The stopper PiezoFlow needle set 1 mm short binding canal , 75 % WL . A syringe contain 15 mL 5.25 % NaOCl attach Piezoflow activation needle inactive needle insert canal till premeasured depth , irrigant flow start activation . During activation , needle move passively canal , maintain insertion depth stopper setting . The irrigation accomplish 1 minute per canal flow rate 15 mL/min . In syringe irrigation group , canal flush 15 ml 5.25 % NaOCl use 27 gauge syringe . After final irrigation , canal dry sterile absorbent point fill calcium hydroxide paste ( Roth International Ltd , Chicago , IL ) use lentulospiral . The tooth temporarily restore Intermediate Restorative Material ( Dentsply Ltd , Weybridge , UK ) . Second Visit In second visit , patient return complete pain chart hand back operator . The intracanal dressing remove H- file copious irrigation 5.25 % NaOCl . The master apical Gutta Percha cone verify . Canals obturate GuttaPercha Zinc Oxide- Eugenol base sealer lateral condensation . After obturation , access cavity restore permanently . An immediate post-operative radiograph take use preset exposure parameter Rinn parallel device ; process manually . Follow Follow clinical radiographic examination carry every 3 month , 12 month procedure .</detailed_description>
