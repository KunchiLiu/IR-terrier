	<brief_summary>Pinhole surgical technique novel minimally invasive , predictable , efficient , time cost-effective technique treatment multiple gingival recession . This procedure involve release incision , suture sharp dissection . It show great post-operative displacement gingival margin may cause great root coverage . Based hypothesis , split mouth randomize controlled clinical trial plan compare clinical outcome pinhole surgical technique without use orthodontic button suture treatment multiple gingival recession .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pinhole Surgical Technique With And Without Use Of Buttons For Treatment Of Multiple Gingival Recessions : RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To achieve multiple adjacent recession coverage optimal integration associate tissue even challenge complex endeavour comparison isolate gingival recession . Treatment protocol outcome different surgical procedure depend variety factor like recession , defect size , presence absence keratinize tissue adjacent defect , width height inter-dental soft tissue , depth vestibule , presence frenum , post-operative stabilization final position advance gingival margin . The final position GM play critical role achieve CRC . Based hypothesis , split mouth clinical trial plan compare clinical outcome pinhole surgical technique without use orthodontic button suture treatment multiple gingival recession . METHOD The aim split-mouth randomize controlled clinical trial clinically compare evaluate effectiveness predictability Pinhole surgical technique alone modification orthodontic button suture 80 site treatment multiple gingival recession assess influence surgical procedure gingival periodontal health , maxillary arch six month post surgically . Gingival recession depth ( GRD ) , Gingival margin location post-surgery , Gingival recession width ( GRW ) , Root coverage esthetic score ( RES ) , Complete root coverage ( CRC ) , Probing depth ( PD ) , Clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , Keratinized tissue width ( KTW ) , Plaque index ( PI ) , Gingival index ( GI ) , Gingival bleed index ( GBI ) measure baseline , 6 week , 3 month 6 month treatment .</detailed_description>
