	<brief_summary>Patients congenital heart disease long discourage participate physical exercise lead impaired exercise capacity population . Since low physical cardiorespiratory fitness show predictor hospitalization mortality grown-up patient congenital heart disease ( GUCH ) , aerobic endurance training recommend recently improve exercise capacity . The aim study compare two type training , namely high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) moderate-intensity continuous exercise ( MICE ) , regard improve exercise capacity without adverse effect heart structure , function rhythm set 12-week outpatient cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program GUCH remain pathology involve right and/or leave ventricle . Primary endpoint change exercise capacity ( maximal oxygen consumption ) 12-week CR . Secondary endpoint change right leave ventricle well vascular function . Patients GUCH reduce function right ventricle recruit informed study within first two week CR . At end week 3 CR supervise MICE , randomization 9 week twice weekly either HIIT MICE take place . MICE training perform intensity 70-85 % maximum heart rate ( HRmax ) 38 min . HIIT consist four 4 min bout high-intensity exercise ( 90-95 % HRmax ) , intersperse 3 min low-intensity interval ( 50-60 % HRmax ) . All patient complete one additional endurance activity per week time duration 30-60 min moderate intensity monitor smart phone . Change peak oxygen uptake well maximal exercise capacity end incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test assess week 3 12 . Vascular function assess time . Volumes function right leave ventricle measure cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) upon inclusion study completion intervention . Furthermore , laboratory marker heart failure well occurrence irregular fast heart beat assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects High-intensity Interval Training Exercise Capacity Patients With Grown-up Congenital Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Adults congenital heart disease long recommend refrain physical exercise . Therefore , often significant reduction exercise capacity . Only recently , regular exercise show safe nowadays recommend patient congenital heart disease . As result , exercise base rehabilitation program implement order improve exercise capacity avoid adverse effect associate inactive lifestyle . Several study show high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) effective moderate-intensity continuous exercise training ( MICE ) improve functional capacity quality life stable cardiac patient perform safely . It therefore emerge new important exercise modality cardiac rehabilitation center Europe stable cardiac patient leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction . However , safety efficacy yet test adult congenital heart disease date study evaluate whether short term peak pulmonary artery systemic pressure bouts 4 min high-intensity exercise negatively affect subpulmonary systemic ventricle GUCH patient . The investigator hypothesize positive effect HIIT exercise capacity vascular function find patient ischemic cardiomyopathy transfer population GUCH patient , short-term bout high-intensity exercise negatively affect cardiac morphology function . Objective To test superiority 9-week high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) standard rehabilitation training base moderate-intensity continuous exercise ( MICE ) exercise capacity patient grown-up congenital heart disease ( GUCH ) residual pathology involve right and/or leave ventricle ( RV/LV ) . Methods Measurements perform 12 week intervention either HIIT MICE training . Patients undergo cardiopulmonary exercise test cycle ergometer determine exercise capacity VO2 peak . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging perform ventricular volume , mass function . Vascular function assess arterial stiffness measurement . Physical exercise , quality life evaluate questionnaire . During 4th 12th week rehabilitation training , heart rate variability measure morning follow training , blood sample take train session analyse marker myocardial stress ( hs Troponin N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide , NT pro-BNP ) . Compliance acceptance training assessed questionnaire .</detailed_description>
