	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase I , multicenter , clinical trial evaluate safety AG-120 AG-221 give combination standard AML induction consolidation therapy . The study plan evaluate 1 dose level AG-120 subject IDH1 mutation 1 dose level AG-221 subject IDH2 mutation . AG-120 AG-221 administer 2 type AML induction therapy ( cytarabine either daunorubicin idarubicin ) 2 type AML consolidation therapy ( mitoxantrone etoposide [ ME ] cytarabine ) . After consolidation therapy , subject may continue maintenance therapy receive daily treatment AG-120 AG-221 1 year Day 1 first induction cycle , relapse , development unacceptable toxicity , hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) .</brief_summary>

Female subject reproductive potential must agree undergo medically supervised pregnancy test prior start study drug . The first pregnancy test perform screening ( within 7 day prior first study drug administration ) . A pregnancy test also perform day first study drug administration confirm negative prior dose well dose Day 1 subsequent cycle Female subject reproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior start therapy . Subjects reproductive potential define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy tubal occlusion naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month . Females reproductive potential well fertile men partner female reproductive potential must agree abstain sexual intercourse use two highly effective form contraception time give informed consent , study , 4 month ( female male ) follow last dose AG120 AG221 . A highly effective form contraception define hormonal oral contraceptive , injectables , patch , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method ( e.g. , synthetic condom , diaphragm cervical cap spermicidal foam , cream , gel ) male partner sterilization Prior chemotherapy AML .
