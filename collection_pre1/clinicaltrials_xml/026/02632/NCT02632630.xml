	<brief_summary>Patients severe malnutrition risk 7.4 time likely die hospital well-nourished patient , carry 30-day readmission rate &gt; 46 % . Although malnutrition common associate extremely poor outcome , neglect undertreated . This randomize controlled pilot trial rapidly identify at-risk hospitalized medical patient , provide nutritional supplementation hospital discharge 28 day . In select at-risk patient , 5 day nutrition deliver peripheral vein use addition oral nutritional supplementation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In pilot trial , feasibility trial protocol establish two centre Canada . Patients high risk malnutrition identify within 48 hour hospital admission use Subjective Global Assessment criterion . Patients randomized factorial design fashion via centralized , internet-based randomization protocol one follow arm : 1 . Peripheral parenteral nutrition enhance oral supplementation ; 2 . Peripheral parenteral nutrition standard care oral supplementation ; 3 . Standard care parenteral fluid administration enhance oral supplementation ; 4 . Standard care parenteral fluid administration standard care oral supplementation . Peripheral parenteral nutrition ( PPN ) intravenous nutrition consist dextrose , amino acid , fat , electrolytes peripheral vein . Peri-OLIMEL 2.5 % E , parenteral solution ( Baxter ) administer study . Patients randomize PPN vs. standard care intravenous maintenance fluid administration 5 day hospitalization discharge , whichever sooner . The PPN administer place maintenance crystalloid solution , adjust stop clinically indicate attend medical team . If maintenance crystalloid fluid administration , parenteral nutrition solution administer rate 0.85mL/kg/hour . The minimum infusion rate 45 mL per hour ( participant weigh 53 kg less ) . The minimum infusion rate would provide supplementation 1,080 kcal/day . The maximum infusion rate 85 mL/hour ( participant weigh 100 kg ) . The maximum infusion rate would provide supplementation 2,040 kcal/day . The PPN solution low osmolarity ( &lt; 900 mOsm ) reduce risk phlebitis ( Peri-OLIMEL 2.5 % E is760mOsm ) . The use PPN , compare total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) offer safety advantage . PPN avoid cost complication central line placement , avoids line sepsis reduces likelihood re-feeding syndrome [ 30-32 ] . Peri-OLIMEL 2.5 % E contain lipid electrolytes reduce likelihood vein irritation refeeding syndrome . All patient monitor closely patient uncontrolled blood sugar exclude . Patients randomized Oral Nutritional Supplementation ( ONS ) receive standard menu standard menu plus oral nutritional supplement . The investigator provide patient one package ONS ( Resource 2.0 - 237 mL , 474 calorie ; similar product ) two time daily hospital . Although patient encourage , require consume oral supplementation product . Upon discharge , patient provide ONS product take home . All participant monitor daily hospital . After discharge , investigator follow participant 30-day follow-up clinic visit , collect data regard clinical outcome , quality life , physical function , nutrition-related variable . This pilot study establish feasibility paradigm-changing protocol rapidly identify aggressively treat malnutrition hospitalize patient , goal improve function , quality life , healthcare utilization , reduce risk adverse clinical event .</detailed_description>
