	<detailed_description>Background : The focus hands-only CPR grown lot last year . The reason 's accept lay rescuer , 's easy remember perform , , , demonstrate efficacy standard CPR least first minute out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) , minute probably lay rescuer intervene . For reason ILCOR 2010 also 2015 guideline recommend technique untrained bystander bystander unwilling give rescue breath . ILCOR 2010 2015 guideline also point 's sufficient perform CPR immediately OHCA . In fact stress CPR must high-quality CPR , CPR compression adequate rate ( 100 120 per minute ) adequate depth ( 5 6 cm ) , complete chest recoil compression minimize interruption compression . This show high-quality CPR improve survival OHCA . It also demonstrate quality hands-only CPR decade 1 minute , consider mean time intervention Emergency Medical System ( EMS ) cardiac arrest scenario Europe 8 minute , 's easy comprehend difficult perform high-quality CPR hands-only technique . It also show 10-seconds pause hands-only CPR protocol increase quality , , moment , share protocol recommend lay rescuer unwilling give rescue breath , except perform chest compression continuously EMS arrival . Purpose : The aim study verify whether inclusion break different frequency duration CPR could increase chest compression quality 8-minutes scenario compare hands-only CPR technique . Materials Methods : The study involve multiple training center Italy Europe , organise Basic Life Support Automated External Defibrillators ( BLS/AED ) course accord ILCOR 2015 guideline , instructor : attendee : manikin ratio 1:5:1 , maximum 1:6:1 , 1 minute training per participant real-time feedback use Laerdal QCPR Resusci Anne Wireless Skill Reporter manikin connect QCPR software . At end course performance 1-min compression-only CPR QCPR/Resusci Anne Wireless Skill Reporter manikin without visual feedback attendee record participant . In order eliminate bias due heterogeneity individual quality CPR , ask participate study , end test , do compression rate 100 120 per minute result &gt; = 75 % parameter `` percentage compression correct depth ( 5 6 cm ) '' , `` percentage correctly release compression '' , `` percentage compression correct hand position '' Those 18 80 year old agree participate signing informed consent , randomize one four arm study . The arm study 4 different CPR protocol : 30 compression 2 second pause ( 30c2s ) , 50 compression 5 second pause ( 50c5s ) , 100 compression 10 second pause ( 100c10s ) continuous chest compression without pause ( hands-only ) . The subject ask carry 8-minutes performance follow protocol assign Laerdal QCPR Resusci Anne Wireless Skill Reporter manikin connect QCPR software without type feedback help .</detailed_description>
