	<brief_summary>The goal study test FOOTFIT enhance FOOTFIT+ , home-based mobile health ( mHealth ) physical activity ( PA ) intervention minimally ambulatory , chronically-ill , population leg ulcer . A highly sensitive clinically design Bluetooth® enable accelerometer track device ( BEAT ) wear foot progressive evidence-based non-exertive leg conditioning activity low leg function ( CALF ) capture minute foot movement send data Smartphone . This six-week feasibility study compare FOOTFIT FOOTFIT+ , add connectivity feature , promote patient-provider communication , evaluate adherence PA , ass signal efficacy functional outcome low fitness population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>FOOTFIT study lower leg condition mHealth intervention patient venous leg ulcer . The aim compare two version , one enhance ( FOOTFIT+ ) , determine great impact physical activity adherence , patient-provider communication , leg function . FOOTFIT FOOTFIT+ share three component : 1 ) low-cost , tri-axial Bluetooth® enable highly sensitive accelerometer track device ( BEAT ) wear foot , 2 ) phase condition activity low leg function ( CALF ) track , 3 ) Smartphone capture signal BEAT , provide motivational message , CALF instruction , automate feedback progress . Forty patient target six-week study , 20 receive FOOTFIT 20 FOOTFIT+ .</detailed_description>
