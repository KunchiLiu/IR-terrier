	<detailed_description>Hemodialysis ( HD ) vascular access dysfunction huge clinical problem result significant morbidity amongst patient End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) , cause severe economic burden health care system . Native arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) prefer form permanent dialysis access since associate best long term outcome compare form dialysis access . Despite clinical benefit , many patient HD AVF dialysis access . One reason low AVF rate early fistula failure ( EFF ) . EFF define AVF never develop adequately dialysis ( failure mature ) fail within 3 month start dialysis . An adequate AVF dialysis accord Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative ( DOQI ) guideline one ) Has flow great 600ml/min , b ) Has diameter 0.6cm great c ) Is approximately deep 0.6cm skin surface . Between 23 % -46 % newly construct AVF problem early failure result dismal one year patency 60-65 % . In order devise strategy prevent EFF , one need understand physiology fistula maturation . Creation AVF lead immediate increase flow vein due pressure gradient create . This increase flow lead increase wall shear stress define mathematically formula 4ηQ/πr3 , η blood viscosity , Q blood flow r vessel radius . Shear stress thus directly proportional blood flow inversely proportional vessel diameter . After creation AVF , flow mediate increase shear stress mitigate vessel dilatation biological mediator . Consequently shear stress bring back pre-anastomosis level lead vessel dilation . It seem positive remodel vein lead AVF maturation dependent increase blood flow rather increase pressure . Any pathology affect blood flow newly construct AVF thus lead failure mature . The two important cause EFF amenable intervention stenosis anywhere circuit and/or presence accessory vein . While stenosis development pathological accessory vein ( av ) presence natural , lead decrease blood flow main AVF circuit , may responsible failure mature . Addressing two entity timely fashion lead salvage many AVF , otherwise would abandon . Although management stenosis well establish relatively clear guideline , management av lack clear scientific approach . It anecdotally recommend av diameter great 25 % AVF diameter consider ligation . It also suggest significance av ascertain assess flow contrast av angiogram assess augmentation AVF manually occlude av procedure . These current recommendation subjective none adequately study date lead considerable debate issue obliterate av . A scientific approach obliteration av essential avoid unnecessary procedure , may even harmful . Also , obliterate non-significant av wait AVF mature may cause delay make definite decision patient . These patient may factor av cause EFF . Conversely , obliterate significant av may also delay use AVF dialysis cause EFF . In recent study researcher recommend hemodialysis arteriovenous flow quantification-diameter ( HAQ ) criteria accessory vein obliteration write : 1 . 60 % great diameter main AVF 2 . 50 % diameter AVF least one av &gt; 40 % diameter . 3 . 50 % diameter divide branch size . 4. av likely interfere cannulation physical examination . 5 . &gt; 30 % diameter associate stenosis site origin . The HAQ criterion av obliteration base computational flow dynamic ( CFD ) model AVF create use 2 dimensional CFD software . This criterion test clinical trial clinical utility establish date . The purpose control , blind , prospective trial ass clinical utility HAQ criterion compare current recommendation av obliteration . Specific Aim : The purpose control , blind , prospective trial ass clinical utility HAQ criterion compare current recommendation av obliteration . Method Materials : Trial Design : The study single center blind , control prospective trial . The study conduct accord ethical standard King Faisal Specialist Hospital &amp; Research Center ( KFSHRC ) human experimentation compliance declaration Helsinki . Participants : The study conduct Interventional Nephrology section KFSHRC , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia . All adult patient ( Age &gt; 18 year ) End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) estimate glomerular filtration rate le 10 approach ESRD AVF create mature enough used dialysis 6 week surgery eligible consideration . Design : All participant EFF currently evaluate cause EFF standard practice KFSHRC . Patients agree participate providing informed consent undergo routine evaluation EFF . As mentioned , stenosis anywhere AVF circuit presence av 2 common cause EFF . Patients stenosis sole cause EFF exclude study . Amongst eligible patient av cause EFF directly undergo av obliteration . Before av obliteration assessment av do ascertain whether satisfies current recommendation HAQ criterion assess effect obliteration access flow show data collection sheet . Data av interpret another expert , blind study detail ( operator ) procedure assure accuracy . Those patient av stenosis present first undergo angioplasty stenotic region . These patient bring back 4 week post intervention re-assessment AVF maturation staff blind intervention detail . av manage indicated time . Patients undergo av obliteration reassess 4 week AVF maturation staff blind intervention detail . Patients thought mature AVF clinical exam schedule cannulation . Final maturity define AVF undergoes 3 consecutive successful HD treatment use AVF . Access flow also measure . The access flow study use ultrasound dilution technique do either first three treatment session . Ultrasound dilution technique accept method assess access blood flow . Patients mature AVF follow intervention follow 6 month monthly evaluation access flow physical examination ass primary secondary patency . The follow extend another 18 month assess long term patency time access management surveillance per local center practice . Procedural Details : Angiograms fluoroscopy perform standard practice procedure . To assess arteriovenous anastamosis stenosis , arteriograms do rather reflux angiogram accurate assess av . As part current guideline practice puff contrast inject AVF av present assess subjectively without measurement thought significant ligate . But study investigator take measurement av well AVF additional step standard care .In case av presence , downstream sheath placement origin av avoid may cause functional downstream stenosis lead slightly high pressure AVF cause alteration size flow av . Data size av AVF diameter collect adequate calibration system . This collect seal intervention later interpret another expert field blind intervention assure accuracy . This interpreter assign whether av satisfies Standard HAQ criteria.The investigator currently use Phillips veradius fluoroscopy equipment . If av qualifies obliteration obliteration perform . For obliteration av either surgical ligation coil embolization use . Both establish current standard practice . Successful obliteration define complete disappearance av repeat angiogram follow procedure . For detail data collect please see data collection sheet end . Statistical Design : Sample Size : For purpose design study term sample size , outcome variable interest whether fistula matures , i.e . binary outcome . The associated parameter so-called binomial parameter denote π . The predictor variable whether patient meet HAQ criterion , i.e . also binary variable . The notation variable X , take value one patient meet HAQ criterion value zero patient meet HAQ criterion . Given notation , π define π0 patient meet criterion , π1 . In statistical term , research hypothesis H0 : π1 - π0 = 0 v H1 : π1 - π0 &gt; = δ &gt; 0 . Of clinical interest conclude H1 δ least equal 0.20 , i.e . probability fistula mature least 20 % great meeting HAQ criterion meeting . With research hypothesis frame , sample size calculation become one estimate binomial parameter , i.e . n = 4 ( 1-πi ) πi/M square , M equal 0.05 . For vary value πi , n maximize πi equal 0.5 . At maximum , n equal 25 , i.e . 25 patient would require type ( meet meeting HAQ criterion ) . Statistical Analysis According description statistical design project , analyse involve test two binomial proportion . Fisher 's Exact test would carry size α = 0.05 . Additional analysis also carry investigate exact relationship size accessory vein probability fistula mature . This would logistic regression analysis repeat covariates analyze generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) .</detailed_description>
