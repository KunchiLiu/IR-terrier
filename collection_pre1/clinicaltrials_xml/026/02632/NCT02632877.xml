	<brief_summary>Diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) develop interaction predispose factor like neuropathy , angiopathy infection . Likewise , environmental factor like lesion hygiene , diet life style . DFU result complication diabetic patient common cause non-traumatic foot amputation people older 50 year . Foot amputation decrease patients´ quality life since 33 % continue walk use prothesis . However , 30 % patient subject amputation die first year surgery 5th year , post-surgery 50 % need amputation remain body extremity . According World Foundation Diabetes , Latin America 18 million people Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 ( DM2 ) . This number increase next 20 year 30 million . Medical expense diabetic patient calculate around 8,000 million dollar , annually . In Mexico , accord Mexican Federation Diabetes 6.5-10 million diabetic patient . Amputation due DFU complication many social economic implication . In Mexico 2011 diabetes mellitus complication principal cause death institute mexican social security ( IMSS ) population . On hand , 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2- ( 1h ) -pyridone ( PFD ) consider anti-inflammatory drug promote re-epithelization due fibroblast stimulation , angiogenesis vasculogenesis tissue remodel . According , investigator believe PFD could play important role DFU resolution reason , investigator consider necessary analyze efficacy 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2- ( 1h ) -pyridone treatment DFU since show improvement chronic skin ulcer pilot study . Nowadays , DFU treatment include management metabolism , angiopathy neuropathy along broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy . However , several report indicate insufficient adequate control diabetic patient . Then , important develop efficient therapy treatment DFU . In context , Ketanserin ( Sufrexal™ ) drug induce scar formation . It demonstrate decrease peripheral vascular resistance , platelet aggregation improve hemorheologic parameter . Topical administration ketanserin show beneficial effect inflammation , granulation epithelization . Since two drug show beneficial effect tissue regeneration , investigator believe important compare safety efficacy treatment DFU</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Pirfenidone Plus MODD Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize use random number table distribute control ( ketanserin ) experimental group ( PFD+MODD ) . Demographics data medical history register monthly basis , relative ulcer volume calculate measure long , wide deep ulcer side sterile flexible graduate ruler . The ulcer classify accord Wagner scale photograph take . Ulcer area wash aseptic solution ( accua aseptic solution™ ) biopsy around 10-15 mm3 take middle ulcer use scalpel blade . Patients experimental group receive topical PFD+MODD ( 8 % gel ) three time day patient control group receive ketanserin ( 2 % cream ) twice day . Both group apply medicament six month previous cleanse area . Biopsies take beginning , month one month two . After time , photograph perform , relative ulcer volume measure . 5 ml blood take begin end study measure general clinical parameter .</detailed_description>

Patients severe arteriopathy possibility direct revascularization like one subject graft tissue , plastic stent position . Patients severe arteriopathy possibility indirect vascularization like one subject sympathectomy . Elimination criterion : Patients without adherence treatment Patients miss medical appointment Patients show allergy 8 % 5methyl1phenyl2 ( 1h pyridone gel MODD component . Patients allergic 2 % ketanserin gel component .</criteria>
