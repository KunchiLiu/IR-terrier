	<brief_summary>In support US marketing application 5-ALA , single arm trial conduct establish efficacy safety Gliolan ( 5-ALA ) patient newly diagnose recurrent malignant glioma . The hypothesis study Gliolan ( 5-ALA ) , adjunct tumor resection , safe real-time tissue fluorescence correlate malignant histopathology . The primary objective single arm study define positive predictive value ( PPV ) Gliolan-induced PPIX fluorescence malignant tumor time initial resection first use FGS take biopsy tissue present red fluorescence observe course resection new recurrent malignant glioma . The functionality performance reliability blue light excitation microscope platform assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>5-Aminolevulinic Acid ( 5-ALA ) Enhance Visualization Malignant Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives - To determine whether Gliolan® ( 5-ALA ) -induced PPIX fluorescence correlate malignant tumor histopathology ( minimum 3-5 serial biopsy take red fluorescent region tissue resection ) . - To determine patient safety profile oral Gliolan® ( 5-ALA ) , well use fluorescence operative microscope . These include use commonly accept toxicity measure well record surgically-related neurological deficit within six week surgery . - To determine functionality performance reliability blue light excitation microscope platform ( Zeiss Pentero , Leica OH4 , Leica OH6 others ) . Secondary Objectives - To correlate PPIX-containing extracellular microvesicles recover blood ( multiple time point prior follow tumor resection ) pre-operative MRI tumor volume . - To characterize presence longitudinal change microvesicle biomarkers recover blood evaluate EGFRvIII , IDH1/2 wt mutation others . These microvesicular blood gene identify correlate microvesicular gene identify tissue time surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects include must MRI document primary brain tumor resection indicate plan . These patient include newly diagnose recurrent malignant glioma . Standard criterion diagnosis include distinct ringlike pattern contrast enhancement thick irregular wall MRI patient presume newly diagnose malignant glioma . Age 1880 . Karnofsky &gt; 60 % . Subjects must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mL Total bilirubin upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine upper limit normal OR Creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . The effect 5aminolevulinic Acid ( 5ALA ) develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . A pregnancy test perform woman childbearing ability prior surgery ( see Exclusion Criteria ) . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Translation provide appropriate institution . Inclusion Women Minorities : Both men woman member ethnic group eligible trial . Patients radiographic tumor , involve , nonresectable midline , basal ganglion , brain stem assess MRI . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) . Patients refrain use potential phototoxic substance ( e.g . tetracycline , sulfonamide , fluoroquinolones , hypericin extract ) 72 h. Personal family history porphyria . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother 5aminolevulinic acid ( 5ALA ) , breastfeed discontinue mother treated 5aminolevulinic acid ( 5ALA ) . Women pregnant exclude trial aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) unknown teratogenic abortifacient effect Prior history GI perforation , diverticulitis , and/or peptic ulcer disease .</criteria>
