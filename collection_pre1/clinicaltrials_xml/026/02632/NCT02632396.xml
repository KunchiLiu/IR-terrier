	<brief_title>Ixazomib After Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose ass safety ixazomib administer post-transplant maintenance mantle cell lymphoma . ( Phase I ) II . To assess preliminary evidence efficacy ixazomib administer post-transplant maintenance mantle cell lymphoma . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate preliminary evidence efficacy ixazomib maintenance therapy patient mantle cell lymphoma undergo autologous stem cell transplant first partial complete remission . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate preliminary evidence efficacy ixazomib maintenance therapy patient mantle cell lymphoma complex karyotype high-risk cytogenetic clinical marker . ( Phase I ) III . To evaluate toxicity associate prolonged administration ixazomib maintenance therapy patient mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) . ( Phase I ) IV . To evaluate rate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) patient complete autologous transplant mantle cell lymphoma assess impact MRD outcomes patient receive maintenance therapy . ( Phase I ) V. To evaluate efficacy ixazomib maintenance therapy patient MCL undergo autologous stem cell transplantation first remission complex karyotype and/or additional high risk cytogenetic clinical feature diagnosis . ( Phase II ) VI . To evaluate safety toxicity prolong administration ixazomib . ( Phase II ) VII . To evaluate long-term disease-related survival outcomes patient MCL receive post-transplant maintenance therapy ixazomib . ( Phase II ) VIII . To evaluate rate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) patient complete autologous transplant mantle cell lymphoma assess impact MRD outcomes patient receive maintenance therapy . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate prognostic value pre-transplant positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) mantle cell lymphoma . II . To evaluate ability single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) array identify high-risk cytogenetic feature patient MCL . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Beginning approximately 100 day ( 180 day ) stem cell transplant , patient receive ixazomib orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
