	<brief_summary>Transition hospital home place patient jeopardy adverse event increase risk rehospitalization . CHF prevalent chronic condition among U.S. adult COPD third lead cause death U.S . Both CHF COPD represent significant burden VHA healthcare system . Care transition support multi-component intervention , costly implement . Virtual nurse provide effective medium explain health concept patient , previous work indicate patient find virtual nurse acceptable . The investigator implement evaluate virtual nurse intervention provide automate , tailor , timely support Veterans transition hospital home . As effective care transition intervention incorporate inpatient outpatient component , virtual nurse first engage patient onscreen inpatient stay via text message post-discharge . This project potential improve care transition experience patient , caregiver healthcare provider .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Technology Assisted Care Transition Intervention Veterans With CHF COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The last decade see steady increase resource VHA use treat chronic heart failure ( CHF ) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , among common reason admission re-admission VHA facility . Multi-component care transition intervention effective , costly . One approach reduce complexity cost offload work technology . Informed sociotechnical model , study propose technology-assisted care transition intervention found concept virtual nurse interacts Veterans different technology channel . The virtual nurse anthropomorphize computer program design simulate discharge nurse . During inpatient stay , virtual nurse appear computer touch screen educate Veterans CHF COPD important component care transition ( draw Coleman Care Transition Model ) well send receive text message mobile phone . Following discharge home , virtual nurse continue coach Veterans family member improve post-discharge access care two-way computer-tailored text messaging make possible VHA 's new HealtheDialog system . Specific aim : 1 . Refine method collect formative measure guide implementation 2 . Conduct randomize trial technology-assisted care transition intervention 3 . Evaluate intervention , include effectiveness , implementation , budget impact The investigator propose mixed method formative assessment simulation experiment refine exist technology VA care transition setting ( Aim 1 ) . This follow multi-site randomized type1 hybrid implementation trial ( Aims 2 3 ) . The trial evaluate effectiveness virtual nurse intervention twelve clinical team also gather information implementation inform broader rollout .</detailed_description>
