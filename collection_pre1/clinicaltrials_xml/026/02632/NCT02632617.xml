	<brief_summary>Preoperative detection combine coronary artery disease invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) recommend American Heart Association ( AHA ) /American College Cardiology ( ACC ) guideline patient ( &gt; 40 yrs male postmenopausal female ) schedule heart valve surgery , low incident rate coronary artery disease imply guideline vast majority ultimately undergo revascularization . Computed tomography angiography ( CTA ) emerge alternative diagnosis procedure , follow advantage : non-invasive , low cost , provide information lung mediastinum . Our study evaluate feasibility compute tomography , instead conventional invasive coronary angiography evaluate coronary artery lesion prior heart valvular operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Valvular heart disease common China , either rheumatic degenerative , valvular repair replacement surgery important therapeutic method . In form heart valvular disease , combine coronary artery disease worsen perioperative prognosis . Preoperative detection combine coronary artery disease invasive coronary angiography recommend patient schedule valve surgery , incidence rate coronary artery disease patient valvular disease show 3 % -19 % patient diagnose significant stenosis . Although invasive coronary angiography consider safe procedure , still carry small risk major ( death , stroke , vascular dissection ) minor ( inguinal hematoma ) complication . Furthermore , catheterization procedure rather expensive , invasive nature involve admission hospital require surveillance experience team . As non-invasive alternative diagnosis procedure , coronary compute tomographic angiography show promising performance high negative predictive value ( 95 % -100 % ) . Furthermore , compute tomography noninvasive procedure low risk cost , easily perform clinic . Except evaluation coronary artery , compute tomography also provide information lung , mediastinum cardiac structure , may help physician make early diagnosis treatment . Computed tomography routinely utilized clinical practice . Our study prospective multicenter study assess feasibility safety add compute tomography gatekeeper perform invasive coronary angiography selectively prior valvular surgery .</detailed_description>
