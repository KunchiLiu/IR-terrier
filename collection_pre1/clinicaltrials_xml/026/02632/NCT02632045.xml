	<brief_summary>This randomize trial patient metastatic HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer progress aromatase inhibitor plus CDK4/6 inhibitor ( either palbociclib ribociclib ) either fulvestrant alone fulvestrant ribociclib . The purpose trial determine whether continued benefit patient remain CDK4/6 inhibitor time switch anti-estrogen therapy . As ribociclib palbociclib similar toxicity drug profile mechanism action , feel appropriate patient receive either drug aromatase inhibitor prior randomization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Efficacy Ribociclib After Progression CDK4/6 Inhibition Patients With HR+ H2N- Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advance early detection therapeutic option , unresectable metastatic breast cancer remain incurable one leading cause cancer-related mortality . Breast cancer molecularly heterogeneous disease . This study evaluate estrogen receptor ( ER ) expression positivity and/or progesterone receptor ( PgR ) positivity breast cancer absence over-expression amplification HER2 . Inhibitors cyclin dependent kinase 4 6 ( CDK4/6 ) develop demonstrated impressive activity patient ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer mark improvement progression free survival . This question ask whether CDK 4/6 inhibition continue hormone therapy patient switch hormone therapy metastatic breast cancer setting .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Men woman least 18 year age histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma breast unresectable metastatic disease . 2 . Most recent tumor biopsy surgical resection specimen must either ER positive , PgR positive , , define immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ≥1 % ( per ASCOCAP guideline ) . 3 . HER2negative breast cancer define negative situ hybridization test IHC status 0 , 1+ 2+ . If IHC 2+ ( i.e . indeterminate ) , negative situ hybridization ( FISH , CISH , SISH ) test require local laboratory test . ( per ASCOCAP guideline ) . 4 . Postmenopausal status receive ovarian ablation GnRH agonist goserelin . Postmenopausal status define one follow criterion : Prior bilateral oophorectomy . Age ≥60 year . Age &lt; 60 amenorrhea 12 month ( absence chemotherapy , tamoxifen , toremifene , ovarian suppression ) FSH , LH , estradiol postmenopausal range per local normal . If patient meet criterion postmenopausal status receive ovarian ablation therapy gonadotropinreleasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist goserelin , patient eligible study , provide GnRH agonist start least 2 week prior C1D1 antiestrogen therapy . 5 . Have evidence measurable unmeasurable disease . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . 7 . Scenario 1 : No prior cdk 4/6 inhibitor . If patient previously receive letrozole , letrozole supply Novartis . If previously progress letrozole , another aromatase inhibitor patient previously receive allow , per standard care ( anastrazole exemestane , supply study ) . Ribociclib supply Novartis . If patient previously receive letrozole , anastrazole , exemestane , ( ) eligible . No prior fulvestrant allow . 8 . Scenario 2 : patient must receive aromatase inhibitor plus palbociclib standard care receive CDK4/6 inhibitor ( palbociclib ribociclib ) part clinical trial , demonstrate evidence disease progression . If patient enrol randomized clinical trial involve ribociclib palbociclib ( MONALEESA PALOMA series trial ) , must know study discontinuation unblinding patient receive investigational drug placebo . Documentation progression duration response aromatase inhibitor plus CDK 4/6 inhibitor provide whenever possible . No prior fulvestrant allow . 9 . Adequate baseline laboratory study ( hematologic chemistry ) , include follow parameter : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 per microliter , Platelets ≥ 75,000 per microliter , Hemoglobin level ≥ 8.0 gm/dL screen complete blood count Potassium , sodium , total calcium ( correct case hypoalbuminemia ) , magnesium , phosphorus within normal limit local laboratory ( Screening value rechecked electrolyte repletion first dose study medication , necessary . ) Serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 mg/dL estimate glomerular filtration rate &gt; 50 mL/min . In absence liver metastasis , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) 2.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) . If patient liver metastasis , ALT AST &lt; 5 × ULN . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN . ( In patient well document Gilbert 's Syndrome , total bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN direct bilirubin within normal range . ) INR ≤ 1.5 10. ) Written informed consent HIPAA authorization obtain subject/legal representative prior performing protocolrelated procedure b ) Subjects must willing able comply schedule visit , treatment schedule , laboratory testing , requirement study 11 .

Patient known hypersensitivity excipients ribociclib , aromatase inhibitor ( letrozole ) fulvestrant 3 . Active central nervous system ( CNS ) disease . History CNS metastases cord compression allowable patient clinically stable least 4 week since completion definitive treatment systemic steroid . In case brain metastasis , patient must stable improved image least 4 week completion definitive treatment . If evidence active leptomeningeal disease , patient ineligible . 4 . Identified visceral crisis , lymphangitic spread , leptomeningeal carcinomatosis . Visceral crisis mere presence visceral metastasis implies severe organ dysfunction assess symptom sign , laboratory study , rapid progression disease . 5 .

To clarify , prior line single agent combination ( example , carboplatin/gemcitabine give concurrently ) . Patients need demonstrated disease progression chemotherapy eligible . Having receive prior target therapy breast cancer ( everolimus experimental agent ) affect eligibility study , exception patient receive investigational CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib ( LY2835219 ) .
