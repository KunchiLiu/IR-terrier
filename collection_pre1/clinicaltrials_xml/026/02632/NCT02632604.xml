	<brief_title>Computerized Cognitive Training Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment prominent feature age mostly characterize memory difficulty . Neuroplasticity base computerized cognitive training emerge last two decade attempt help elderly population impairment . The aim study perform computerized cognitive training improve attention , concentration , learning , quality life elderly participant . The investigator interested test differential efficacy bottom-up top-down versus top-down bottom-up computerized cognitive training . The investigator conduct 40 hour computerize , adaptable , cognitive training program participant 60 year age . Participants come 1 hour , daily , perform bottom-up top-down top-down bottom-up training , control game 2 month . Bottom-up top-down top-down bottom-up exercise choose target cognitive domain divide selective attention , short-term work memory , orientation skill social cognition . Cognitive emotional data collect training , half way , training , assess progress several aspect function . The investigator hypothesize bottom-up top-down top-down bottom-up training effective compare control game . They also expect bottom-up top-down training efficient compare top-down bottom-up training first target basic cognitive function allow trigger higher cognitive function , reach optimal cognitive performance level rapidly , second may start high demand cognitive function , may compromise participant ability reach optimal level cognitive performance fast first type training , `` bottom-up lever '' first . The investigator also hypothesize training improve quality life .</detailed_description>
