	<detailed_description>A recruitment 40 sedentary men woman â‰¥ 60 year age elevate cardiovascular risk follow 20 week . Participants randomly assign ( n = 20/group ) 1 ) 8-week , twice-weekly , multi-modal , center-based exercise intervention ( EX ) follow 12 additional week follow-up assessment , 2 ) intervention participant also ask wear validated lightweight activity tracker hip waking hour instruct reduce sedentary behavior increase NEPA within daily routine ( EX + NEPA ) . Evaluations do 1 ) extent EX + NEPA modifies sedentary behavior , 2 ) impact intervention cardiovascular risk factor , include blood pressure , exercise capacity , waist circumference , circulate biomarkers , 3 ) develop optimize study procedure guide future trial .</detailed_description>
