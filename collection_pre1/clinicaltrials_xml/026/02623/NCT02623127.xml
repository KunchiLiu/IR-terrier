	<brief_title>A Study Sunitinib Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Thymic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sunitinib ( Sutent® ; Pfizer , New York , NY , USA ) multitargeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) activity stem cell-factor receptor ( KIT ) platelet-derived growth-factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , vascular endothelial growth-factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor ( rearrange transfection [ RET ] ) , colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor ( CSF1R ) , Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 receptor ( FLT3 ) . Sunitinib potent inhibitor mutant KIT additional inhibitory effect VEGF receptor potentially might make effective imatinib TCs . In current version NCCN guideline , sunitinib suggest one potential target therapeutic advanced TCs . We plan study investigate clinical efficacy tolerability sunitinib patient advance recurrent TCs Korean population . In addition , collect tumor sample blood sample patient exploration predictive biomarkers .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Provision sign , write date informed consent prior study specific procedures 2 . Histopathologically confirm metastatic recurrent thymic thymic carcinoma 3 . Age ≥ 20 4 . ECOG PS 02 5 . Documented progressive disease one conventional systemic chemotherapy 6 . At least one measurable disease RECIST v1.1 7 . Adequate organ function treatment follow : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L Platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( without liver metastasis ) , ≤ 5.0 x ULN ( liver metastasis ) 8 . Life expectancy ≥ 12 week day 1 1 . Previous treatment sunitinib VEGFTKIs 2 . Any major operation irradiation within 4 week baseline disease assessment 3 . Any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may impair intake absorption study drug 4 . CNS metastasis continuous corticosteroid use within 4 week baseline disease assessment ( Asymptomatic CNS metastasis patient enrol ) 5 . Patients uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease ( AMI within 12 month , Unstable angina within 6 month , NYHA Class III , IV Congestive heart failure leave ventricular ejection fraction local institutional low limit normal 45 % , Congenital long QT syndrome , Any significant ventricular arrhythmia , Any uncontrolled second third degree heart block , Uncontrolled hypertension ) 6 . Concomitant malignancy ( except adequately treat basal cell cancer skin cervical cancer situ ) 7 . Female patient pregnant , breastfeed male female patient reproductive potential employ effective method birth control 8 . Other severe acute chronic medical condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry trial . ( include active bleeding , untreated DVT thromboembolism )</criteria>
