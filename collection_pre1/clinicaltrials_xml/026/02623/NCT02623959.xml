	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare indwell pleural catheter ( IPC ) combination saline ( current standard care ) versus IPC combination doxycycline treatment pleural effusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Indwelling Pleural Catheter With Either Doxycycline Saline Day 7 Pleurodesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IPC Placement Placement Follow-Up : Before IPC insert , complete 2 questionnaire quality life symptom may . It take 15-20 minute complete . You also chest x-ray rate pain scale 1-10 . These test part standard care explain detail doctor . You require sign separate consent form order IPC place . Your doctor give detailed instruction IPC placement procedure , include risk . After IPC place , doctor give prescription fentanyl patch help control pain . The study staff tell wear fentanyl patch side effect associate fentanyl . About 5 day ( +/- 2 day ) IPC place , clinic visit check part standard care . It important wear fentanyl patch morning visit . At clinic visit , result previously perform chest x-ray reviewed , ask rate pain scale 1-10 , ask much fluid drain catheter . Based result Day 5 check-up , find ineligible receive study drug , fentanyl patch take follow part usual care . However , still consider study follow participant receives study drug . If find eligible receive study drug , receive fentanyl vein minute , need help control pain . The study staff begin drain catheter either doxycycline saline ( describe ) place catheter . The catheter cap 1 hour drain . To determine receive doxycycline saline , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . This do one know one study group well , , bad group . - If Group 1 , receive doxycycline . - If Group 2 , receive saline . Neither study doctor know receive doxycycline saline . However , need safety , study staff able find receiving . Length Study Participation : You receive doxycycline saline 1 time study . Your participation study withdraw consent study close , whichever take place first . Follow-Up : Between 10-14 day receive either doxycycline saline , come clinic part usual standard care doctor check IPC possible leaking , infection , see much fluid drain , remove suture . The catheter may remove leaking show sign infection . You continue visit 1 time month part standard care catheter remove . During visit : - You chest x-ray check status lung . - You complete 2 questionnaire complete IPC place . Long-Term Follow-Up : One ( 1 ) time month IPC remove , call ask , side effect , disease come back , overall quality life . Some information may collect medical record . Each phone call last 5-10 minute . This investigational study . Doxycycline FDA approve commercially available treatment different type infection pleural effusion . It consider investigational compare doxycycline saline treat pleural effusion . Up 250 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
