	<brief_summary>Patients implantable heart device include pacemaker , defibrillator , cardiac monitor may seek regular medical care relate implanted device . These device capable detect abnormal heart rhythm device abnormality may benefit clinical action oversight . A novel healthcare information technology develop implement clinically screen patient cardiac rhythm device seek care emergency room setting . This study seek examine difference detection cardiac rhythm disturbance include atrial fibrillation ( AF ) utilization new screen technology , often treatment plan change patient heart rhythm abnormality detect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Novel Healthcare Information Technology Tool Improve Care Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , observational study design evaluate use Geneva Healthcare Patient Population Management platform detect AF ( atrial fibrillation ) patient CIEDs ( cardiovascular implantable electronic device ) emergency room setting , assess feasibility sub-specialty cardiac electrophysiology ( EP ) care patient . This PI-initiated study currently plan conduct study site . The investigator plan use Geneva Healthcare Patient Population Management platform detect AF patient CIEDs utilize clinical excellence team nurse practitioner research assistants ensure appropriate treatment AF pursue . UCSD ( University California , San Diego ) use Geneva Patient Population Management Platform clinical purpose since September , 2012 emergency room sit Hillcrest Thornton . The platform experimental device . After patient 's device interrogate usual fashion place wand patient , download information device manufacturer interrogator , information upload Geneva platform , organize physician interpret . After data process organize password protect system , data retrieve CIED upload UCSD 's electronic medical record system , EPIC , hospital personnel . For purpose study , Geneva Healthcare PPM ( Patient Population Management ) platform simply tool use collect relevant device data ER setting . The investigator plan clinically screen patient evaluate either two UCSD emergency department cardiac rhythm device . This ER screening incorporate standard clinical practice conduct EP staff . The goal detect patient AF refer direct electrophysiology evaluation . Patients AF data capture physiologic arrhythmia data collect Geneva Healthcare PPM platform point-of-care interrogation ER ( emergency room ) home monitoring . A Clinical Excellence Team physician , nurse practitioner , nurse direct identify patient AF appropriate treatment referral EP subspecialist treatment consideration include rate control , rhythm control , stroke prophylaxis therapy , ablation therapy . The patient offer clinic appointment EP subspecialist . Patients identified atrial fibrillation refer research staff . If patient interested participation main trial , informed consent obtain one study investigator research coordinator . Patients enrol trial follow course standard clinical treatment atrial fibrillation 12 month , include ablation medication therapy . Outcomes include morbidity , mortality , hospitalization , healthcare utilization , recurrent AF evaluate patient ( include take ablation vs. ) . If patient refuse refer EP subspecialist , patient approach research . The patient encourage follow-up previous physician recently see , include primary care physician and/or cardiologist standard clinical care . The investigator propose pilot clinical excellence study leverage innovative healthcare information technology tool capture patient AF CIEDs , efficiently route patient guideline-based treatment goal appropriate radiofrequency catheter ablation AF and/or medical therapy . The investigator ' mission evaluate ability detect AF patient cardiac rhythm device novel healthcare technology , increase access proper medical procedural therapy AF , evaluate centralized repository follow-up clinical result outcome patient population .</detailed_description>
