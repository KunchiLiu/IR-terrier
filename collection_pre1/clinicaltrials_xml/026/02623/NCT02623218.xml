	<detailed_description>The primary aim study examine effect acupuncture brain function cognition acute 10-day window follow mild traumatic brain injury . Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) affect estimate 1.7 2.3 million Americans every year . As clinical importance manage TBI grows , essential therapy help recovery management post-concussion symptom identify . Currently , number one recommend treatment strategy physical cognitive rest , follow gradual return daily activity exercise . Cerebral blood flow decline follow TBI , remain depressed state ongoing lengths time . The cellular vulnerability symptomatic presentation follow TBI likely due metabolic imbalance decrease cerebral blood flow increase demand glucose adenosine triphosphate production . Animal human study show acupuncture location locally head neck , well distally arm , hand , leg , foot , increase cerebral blood flow middle cerebral artery , anterior cerebral artery , basilar artery . Acupuncture long history use treatment acute chronic pain , headache , migraine , nausea , anxiety , sleep disorder , however , study specific utilization acupuncture manage symptom follow TBI lack . The investigator hypothesize acupuncture treatment may improve cerebral blood flow result overall improvement brain function cognition follow TBI . Acupuncture may provide safe treatment improve outcome follow TBI , increase rate recovery .</detailed_description>
