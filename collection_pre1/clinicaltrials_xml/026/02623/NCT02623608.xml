	<brief_summary>After energy-rich meal blood level glucose lipid undergo mark temporary increase , trigger wave oxidative stress due appearance excess free radical adipose muscle tissue . Elevated postprandial hypertriglyceridemia associate increase risk cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes . Hence , postprandial change different circulate biomarkers potential predictor cardiometabolic risk . In addition possibility evaluate acute variation metabolic risk marker response different type fat , metabolic challenge approach may serve challenge-meal background order reveal possible beneficial effect specific food ingredient . In study , circulate cardiometabolic disease-related biomarkers , include endotoxemia , assess postprandially search beneficial action particular functional food ingredient consume combination high-fat meal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study carry group healthy mature subject overweight normal fast blood glucose value . A randomized crossover design follow , postprandial metabolic response high fat breakfast ( HF ) compare registered identical breakfast contain functional ( `` active '' ) ingredient . Each meal test independent experimental session . Experimental session take place with1 week interval . The study carry Food Health Laboratory , Food Health Science Centre - Lund University ( Medicon Village , Lund ) . The volunteer consume challenge HF alone 4 active ingredient , i.e . volunteer undergo five experimental session . Additionally , plan contemplate initial information visit include screen fast blood glucose . In total , volunteer complete study pay six visit Food Health Laboratory . Based result above-described phase , second step study focus impact order consumption -i.e . `` active ingredient '' HF vice versa cardiometabolic risk outcome , way optimize putative protective action .</detailed_description>
