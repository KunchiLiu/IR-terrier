	<brief_summary>Allogeneic ( Allo ) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) recognize curative procedure hematological malignancy . It well know property relate graft-versus-tumor ( GVT ) effect develop immunocompetent cell contain generate donor graft . For year , however , despite unique antitumoral activity , Allo-HSCT restrict limited number patient due two major limitation : toxicity procedure absence donor every single patient . More recently stage dramatically change respect two restraint . Over last decade , many study establish feasibility Allo-HSCT older patient availability MRD even less frequent elderly , likely related medical contraindication graft donation sibling death . UD routinely use associate high incidence GVHD . As compare young population , unrelated cord-blood HSCT seldom perform population number decrease age due fear risk suppose increase lethal infectious complication related effect delay immune reconstitution elderly . Thus need alternative donor allow safe efficient transplantation still unmet . In consequence , overall , despite fact Allo-HSCT feasibility establish old patient , lack contribute eventually maintain low rate allo-HSCT perform population high incidence hematologic malignancy usually present poor prognosis . Thus critical develop innovative efficient therapeutic strategy answer unmet-medical need . In perspective , Haplo-HSCT could represent part answer age population . It offer potential advantage offer rapid donor determination virtually every single patient . In addition , data suggest elderly haplo-HSCT use T-repleted graft , RIC PT-HDCy present low NRM retain antitumor effect despite low GVHD incidence . They also suggest haplo-HSCT may conduct good outcome URD-HSCT alternative MRD-HSCT . It may also associate low cost ( graft purchase low post-transplant complication rate ) good QOL likely relate low cGVHD-rate . In addition conduct trial time diffusion strategy population start really crucial widespread uncontrolled dissemination . The investigator propose address question prospectively compare 2 strategy elderly patient without MRD , term efficacy , safety include prospective evaluation study quality-of-life ( QOL ) . They conduct national , multicenter , open-label , comparative , randomized phase III trial patient hematological malignancy justify allo-HSCT alternative donor MRD identify . When MRD search recognize failure , patient include clinical trial inform consent randomize two strategy base donor search : - Reference group : Unrelated Donor group - Investigational group : Haplo Donor Group Investigators use composite end-point embrace three main cause failure : death , relapse severe cGVHD ( surrogate endpoint QOL ) . We analyze HSCT usual objective GHVD , NRM , relapse survival . A specific study patient ' health relate quality life also conduct use FACT-BMT questionnaire . In addition , success two strategy term transplant completion ( donor determination , transplant realization time ) compare .</brief_summary>
