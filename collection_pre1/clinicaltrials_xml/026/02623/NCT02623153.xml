	<brief_summary>The choice neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen locally advance gastric cancer controversial . The aim study compare short- long-term outcome XELOX regimen Docetaxel , S1 oxaliplatin regimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen locally advance gastric cancer . The objective study determine kind neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategy make subsequent radical surgery feasible improve overall survival patient locally advanced gastric cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between XELOX S1 , Oxaliplatin Docetaxel Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient selection Patients unresectable , histologically confirm gastric adenocarcinoma distant metastasis eligible study . No-resectability judge technical reason local multidisciplinary team , accord one follow criterion : 1. radical resection unable laparotomy laparoscopic exploration . 2. tumour invades adjacent structure pancreas , liver , diaphragm , adrenal gland transversa colon ( T4b ) . 3 . Para-aortic ( LN ) lymph node metastasis ≥1.0 cm upper margin celiac artery upper border inferior mesenteric artery ( station . 16a2/16b1 ) , and/or bulky lymph node ( ≥3 cm×1 or≥1.5 cm×2 ) along celiac , splenic , common proper hepatic artery , superior mesenteric vein ; All patient receive endoscopic examination , contrast CT scan abdomen pelvic , chest X-ray , well physical examination . The exclusion criterion include : ( 1 ) peritoneal metastasis confirm CT scan ; ( 2 ) lung metastasis , liver metastasis , pleural effusion , and/or distant metastasis ; ( 3 ) serious uncontrolled comorbid condition ; ( 4 ) local intervention initial diagnosis , surgical procedure , radiotherapy trans-artery chemo-embolization ; ( 5 ) patient could comprehend comply study also ineligible . A multidisciplinary evaluation require patient 's participation study . All patient sign approve write informed consent . The protocol trial approve institutional review board Zhongshan Hospital , Fudan University . Preoperative chemotherapy All patient receive chemotherapy diagnosis . Since definite regimen instructed guideline , physician prescribe XELOX regimen ( capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 , orally administer twice day day 1-14 oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2on day 1 , intravenous 2 h infusion ) S1 40mg/m2 , orally administer twice day day 1-14 , oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 docetaxel 40 mg/m2on day 1 intravenous accord clinician 's preference . Chemotherapy repeat every three week . Tumor response toxicity criterion After every two cycle ( 6 week ) , abdominal pelvic CT scan perform evaluate tumor response.Treatment plan four cycle tumor assess respectability multidisciplinary team use CT scan . Resection intend do within 4-6 week last treatment cycle . Patients unresectable tumor continue treatment tumor response progression , assess respectability every two cycle maximum duration eight cycle . Following resection , patient continue treatment four cycle . . Patients progressive disease unacceptable toxicity treat discretion investigators.Response treatment evaluate accord response evaluation criterion solid tumor ( RECIST ) 1.1 . The adverse event assess accord Common Toxicity Criteria National Cancer Institute ( NCI-CTC ) 3.0 . Surgical procedure The type surgery perform depended location extent primary cancer . The tumor resect along gastric margin ≥5 cm feasible . For distal tumor , subtotal gastrectomy consider , total gastrectomy perform proximal cancer . An attempt make perform extend LN ( lympho node ) resection ( D2 ) patient qualify go under-radical surgery . The surgical specimen pathologically evaluate grade0 degeneration and/or necrosis absent tumor , grade 1a area account less one-third tumor , grade 1b area account one-third less two-thirds tumor , grade 2a area account two-thirds tumor , although tumor tissue apparently remain , grade 2b minimal tumor cell remain , grade 3 residual tumor detected.Patients grade 1b , 2a , 2b , 3 tumor classify responder , pathologic complete response ( pCR ) define grade 3 . Postoperative treatment After R0 resection , adjuvant chemotherapy original regimen initiate within 42 day surgery , eight cycle administer perioperative period . Patients could undergo radical operation receive palliative chemotherapy evidence disease progression appear . All enrol patient follow regularly . Physical blood examination conduct every 3 month first 3 year every 6 month thereafter . An abdominal CT scan perform every 6 month first 3 year , every year thereafter . Chest CT scan upper gastrointestinal endoscopy conduct every year . Statistical analysis The primary study endpoint response rate , secondary endpoint include R0 resection rate , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) toxicity . PFS measure date initial treatment first objective documentation disease progression , palliative surgery relapse . OS measure start treatment date last follow-up death . All patient follow every three month . Patient baseline characteristic disease factor summarize use descriptive statistic . The categorical parameter compare use two-sided Pearson 's test Fisher 's exact test , appropriate.The PFS OS generate Kaplan-Meier method compare mean log-rank test . Software ( version 16.0 ; Chicago , IL ) use statistical analysis . A P &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
