	<brief_summary>Patients undergo arthroscopic hip surgery show significant post-operative pain may delay discharge , recovery , early mobilisation . A pre-operative regional anesthesia technique , fascia iliaca block may effective method acute post-operative analgesia . This prospective , randomize control study preoperative fascia iliaca block patient undergo hip arthroscopy .

	<brief_title>A Prospective Analysis Preoperative Fascia Iliaca Block Hip Arthroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arthroscopic hip surgery use diagnose treat interior joint pathology . Although minimally invasive nature , patient considerable amount pain postoperatively , lead prolonged recovery room stay increase opiate requirement . The investigator perform retrospective chart review patient underwent hip arthroscopy UCSF Orthopedic Institute . 89 % patient pain immediate surgery require opioid therapy . Regional anesthesia previously show reduce discomfort hip arthroscopy . However , currently safe , well-established ultrasound guide regional anesthesia technique arthroscopic hip surgery . The fascia iliaca block show decrease acute pain related hip fracture , well pain related knee arthroplasty . The ultrasound guide fascia iliaca block easy perform excellent safety record . The investigator believe ultrasound guide fascia iliaca block improve pain control patient undergo arthroscopic hip surgery . Patients receive sham block group fascia iliaca block , perform preoperative area . Pain score measurement quadriceps strength assess preoperatively postoperatively . The patient receive pain diary consist pain score , pain medication consumption , brief pain inventory . Within 48 hour postoperatively , anesthesiologist call patient review patient 's pain score , pain medication consumption brief pain inventory .</detailed_description>
