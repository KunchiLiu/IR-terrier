	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE : Skin cancer common cancer incidence increase rapidly Western country . In Netherlands registry skin cancer poor , however base recent literature guideline investigator estimate number new malignant skin tumor precursor actinic keratosis ( AK ) 2015 around 235,278 , major impact health care system . Moreover , predict number skin cancer rise 4.5-8 % per year , depend type skin cancer . Skin cancer comprise melanoma non-melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC : basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) , squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) precursor actinic keratosis ( AK ) Bowen disease ) . In case suspicion NMSC , present , pathological examination biopsy gold standard . In case clinical suspicion AK , diagnosis make à vue , without pathological confirmation . In United States , already 2003 , skin cancer find among costly cancer treat , thus , evident skin cancer place enormous burden western healthcare system increase cost . As BCC common skin cancer ( 75 % skin cancer ) estimate incidence 51,000 new tumor 2015 , study focus skin cancer type . HEALTH CARE EFFICIENCY PROBLEM : As described , incidences various malignant skin tumour increase dramatically . The rise number skin cancer may result long waiting list consultation department dermatological care increase health care cost . In case suspicion skin cancer utmost importance diagnose treat early phase , preferable patient friendly manner . With implementation reflectance confocal microscopy ( RCM ) routine patient care setting diagnosis assess first consultation patient treat instantly . A second consultation explain diagnosis necessary , time use new patient . Also , conventional diagnostic procedure ( pathological investigation skin biopsy ) investigator experience 29 % case sample error , BCC subtype correctly identify , treatment depend BCC subtype many patient need subsequent treatment treatment failure recurrence . Also pathologists , examine skin tumor skin tumor efficient challenge . More pathologist need diagnostic technique future . RCM also , unimportantly , low cost diagnose skin cancer . USUAL CARE : Currently , case suspicion NMSC , include BCC , invasive diagnostic biopsy pathological examination performed.Treatment choice depend BCC subtype . THE INTERVENTION TO BE INVESTIGATED : RCM non-invasive imaging technique . It provide real time image cell- tissue structure dynamic situ , without need ex vivo tissue sample . RCM visualize human skin depth around 250 μm . Most , tumor visualize . For thicker tumor RCM may help find optimal localization perform biopsy , superficial feature tumor may help spot . Moreover , whole tumor image RCM diagnosis make instantly . RCM feature skin cancer report , show high correlation conventional pathological feature . These feature allow diagnose AK SCC , subtypes BCC ( superficial , nodular , micronodular , infiltrative mixed type BCCs ) . RCM RELEVANCE FOR PRACTICE Skin cancer responsible 50 % cost dermatological patient care , 75-80 % cost cause BCC . These cost increase even , incidence rate rise . As described , gold standard pathological investigation biopsy excision . However , pathological diagnosis biopsy often result sample error , small part tumor investigate result potentially inappropriate chosen therapy . The subtypes BCC treat differently . As sample error may lead treatment failure recurrence , subsequent treatment need , increase cost . In addition , conventional method unfriendly patient , invasive , painful , scar , diagnosis instantly available . In order implement patient friendly RCM daily BCC care , large prospective study need . The ability RCM determine correct diagnosis subtyping BCC need investigate well prepare protocol use patient care . It believe diagnostic imaging technique cost-effective patient friendly compare biopsy procedure , gold standard present . Therefore , purpose study investigate whether reflectance confocal microscopy correctly identify subtype basal cell carcinoma . Study design : Randomized control trail . Comparison usual care ; punch biopsy excision .</detailed_description>
