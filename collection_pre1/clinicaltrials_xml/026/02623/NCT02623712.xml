	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct unblinded , prospective , pragmatic , cluster-randomized , comparative effectiveness trial intensive versus less intensive CT surveillance patient find small pulmonary nodule diverse health care setting . The goal pragmatic clinical trial identify surveillance strategy maximize early diagnosis individual cancerous nodule , minimize unnecessary surveillance patient without cancer result emotional stress , exposure harmful ionizing radiation , discovery incidental finding may lead unnecessary treatment .</detailed_description>
