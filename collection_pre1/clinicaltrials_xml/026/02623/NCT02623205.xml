	<brief_summary>Despite current medication , morbidity mortality Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) remain high . According World Health Organization , MDD affect 121 million people worldwide , project second lead cause global disability 2020 . Monotherapy SSRIs widely use treatment MDD . However , average , SSRIs require six week onset action , two-thirds SSRIs fail achieve remission.Compounding problem , patient residual symptom significantly likely discontinue treatment relapse , hospitalize medical psychiatric condition , die suicide cause . Although eliminate ineffective treatment trial would significantly reduce patient suffer healthcare cost , clinician currently tool objectively select treatment base individual 's likelihood remission . Therefore , urgent need identify marker predictive individual 's SSRI treatment outcome . Developing personalized treatment require increase understanding relationship pretreatment neurobiology , SSRI-induced biological change , correspond symptom improvement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : Determine Pretreatment Marker SSRI Effectiveness Using PET . With goal reduce MDD burden , many study assess utility FDG-PET antidepressant treatment prediction . However , due limitation list , consensus brain region predictive treatment efficacy . In addition serve biomarker SSRI effectiveness , conclusive determination region provide insight depression pathophysiology , help uncover SSRI mechanism action , aid search novel therapeutic . Based investigator ' preliminary data , similar study , investigator hypothesize SSRI-induced change Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( deltaHDRS ) correlate pretreatment metabolic rate glucose ( MRGlu , quantify use arterial blood analysis ) three potential region : ( 1 ) midbrain , ( 2 ) right anterior insula , and/or ( 3 ) leave ventral prefrontal cortex . Aim 2 : Isolate Neurobiological Basis `` Loss '' Research Domain Criteria ( RDoc ) Change Associated Treatment . Using factor analysis HDRS , investigator previously demonstrate `` loss '' RDoC criterion significantly correlate MRGlu frontal cortical area . The investigator therefore hypothesize change MRGlu ( pre post treatment ) region correlate symptom improvement specifically `` loss '' symptom . As exploratory extension , investigator determine whether change treatment-specific ( i.e . SSRI placebo ) . A validation hypothesis suggest target mechanism action , provide significant step forward precision treatment . If regional change MRGlu correlate improvement RDoC category , suggest SSRI ( placebo ) induce change may downstream effect examine . Aim 3 : Validate NonInvasive Full Quantification MRGlu Using Simultaneous Estimation . Full quantification brain MRGlu FDG ( perform study ) require measure FDG arterial plasma ( input function ) arterial catheter insertion blood analysis . This costly invasive procedure create barrier widespread PET use . The investigator develop innovative method Simultaneous Estimation ( SimE ) input information PET outcome measure ( e.g . MRGlu ) . SimE fully quantify brain MRGlu without require arterial catheter . In case FDG , investigator ' data suggests SimE use single venous sample provide accurate result . The investigator hypothesize venous sample may entirely replace study data ( e.g. , inject dose ) biometrics ( e.g. , body surface area , lean body mass index ) . Using two different approach ( statistical imputation physiological parametric model ) previously collect data , investigator train SimE accurate quantification absence blood data . The rich data collect study provide robust benchmark validation SimE approach . Aim 4 : Validate Noninvasive Estimates Plasma Radioactivity Novel miniPET Scanner . In parallel SimE ( algorithm/software ) development , investigator test noninvasive method plasma analysis use hardware . FDG concentration measure wrist , arm , ankle leg novel synchronize PET scanner develop co-Investigator , Dr. Paul Vaska .</detailed_description>
