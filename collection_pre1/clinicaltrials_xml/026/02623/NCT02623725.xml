	<brief_summary>The aim study ass describe booster effect CYD dengue vaccine dose administer 4 5 year completion 3-dose vaccination schedule . Primary Objective - To demonstrate non-inferiority , term geometric mean titer ratio ( GMTRs ) , CYD dengue vaccine booster compare third CYD dengue vaccine injection subject previous CYD dengue vaccine trial . Secondary Objectives : - If primary objective non-inferiority achieve : To demonstrate superiority , term GMTRs , CYD dengue vaccine booster compare third CYD dengue vaccine injection subject previous CYD dengue vaccine trial . - To describe immune response elicit CYD dengue vaccine booster placebo injection subject receive 3 dos CYD dengue vaccine previous CYD dengue vaccine trial . - To describe neutralize Ab level dengue serotype post-dose 3 ( previous CYD dengue vaccine trial ' subject ) immediately prior booster placebo injection subject . - To describe neutralize Ab persistence 6 month , 1 year , 2 year post booster placebo injection subject . - To evaluate safety booster vaccination CYD dengue vaccine subject .</brief_summary>
