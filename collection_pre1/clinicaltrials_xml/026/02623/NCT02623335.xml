	<detailed_description>To answer research question , `` Could patient-driven approach improve decision making informs postoperative expectation effectiveness current surgeon-directed preoperative conversation ? '' investigator conduct multi-site randomized control trial question prompt list intervention ( QPL ) high risk surgery : 1 . Compare effectiveness intervention relative usual care extent patient engagement decision-making high risk surgery . ( Aim 1 ) 2 . Compare effectiveness intervention relative usual care treatment choice psychological well-being post-treatment regret patient family member . ( Aim 2 ) 3 . Compare effectiveness intervention relative usual care interpersonal intrapersonal conflict relate treatment decision subsequent treatment receive . ( Aim 3 ) The overall goal study help patient family : 1. make treatment decision align value goal ; 2. anticipate make sense postoperative outcome ; 3. experience less postoperative conflict treatment serious complication . Enrolled surgeon group base self-report clinic practice . `` Visit 1 Surgeons '' typically treatment decision make conversation patient initial new patient consult . For enrolled patient surgeon , audio-record first consult visit . `` Visit 2 Surgeons '' typically treatment decision make discussion initial visit- discussion generally delay follow appointment , additional testing review medical record . The return/second visit enrol patient care Visit 2 Surgeons record . When surgeon usual care arm , patient receive current standard surgical decision-making . Once enrol surgeon cross intervention arm , research team mail QPL intervention surgeon 's new consult patient ( Visit 1 Surgeons ) returning/2nd consult patient ( Visit 2 Surgeons ) week prior schedule consultation , regardless study eligibility . The QPL intervention include QPL intervention brochure , plus letter surgeon encouraging use upcoming office visit . Eligible patient identify clinic staff interested patient approach arrive clinic ( receive information study prior clinic appointment information could interfere QPL intervention ) . Patients usual care arm receive current standard surgical decision-making . The investigator observe usual care include informed consent surgeon-directed deliberative phase surgeon present evaluation trade-off goal propose intervention . Although deliberation occur front patient family , assumption value specific outcomes surgeon-generated specifically link patient preference . For reason , investigator believe compare intervention usual care suitable . In addition , question prompt list currently available online distribute surgeon . Patients obtain use list choose ( although ) . Additionally , question prompt list show safe effective previous study similar identical clinical situation . Surgeons randomly assign within site change usual care QPL intervention different study wave time point . Prior study start investigator conduct step-wise randomization use computer-generated randomization schedule determine crossover wave timing among surgeon . Surgeon cross-over usual care intervention occur one direction within-site change occur every four month . Surgical clinic contact one month prior intervention implementation confirm execute implementation process start mail QPL intervention patient office visit schedule first day intervention transition . A 2-week hiatus data collection start cross institute transition clinic ensure patient intervention group opportunity receive intervention mailing . Surgeons cross intervention group notify QPL intervention implement clinic encourage bi-weekly email text reminder support patient use question list clinical encounter patient discuss surgical treatment option . For patient usual care intervention arm : Surgeons perform high risk operation agree participate help identify new return patient ( depend previously report practice pattern ) come outpatient visit discus major surgical procedure . If patient consent study , study staff audio record one conversation ( T0 ) attend surgeon patient accompany family member . Study staff meet patient prior start audio record obtain consent . If family member present appointment would like participate study activity , study staff obtain consent well . If resident/surgical trainee additional family member caretaker present , study staff obtain verbal permission audio record resident others present . Study staff wait surgeon enters room turn digital audio recorder . Once audio recorder turn , research team member leave room return meeting patient surgeon complete terminate collect audio recording . Study staff conduct follow-up phone call administer survey patient family member ( enrol ) within 12-72 hour patient 's audio-recorded treatment decision-making visit ( T1 ) . After visit surgeon , patient 's treatment plan determine chart review confirm surgeon clinic nurse . Administration second third survey ( T2 T3 ) link patient 's treatment plan . For patient schedule surgery , survey administer via telephone patient family member 1-2 ( T2 ) week surgery 6-8 ( T3 ) week surgery . Based previous study patient population clinical setting , median time patient 's preoperative visit surgeon surgery 31 day . If patient unable participate study activity , enrol family member still ask complete study activity . Patients family member enroll along unable participate study activity post-operatively consider lose follow . For patient non-operative treatment ; e.g. , medical treatment ( chemotherapy , pulmonary rehab ) observation ( active surveillance , surgical procedure schedule ) , study staff administer survey 6 8 week ( T2 ) 12 14 ( T3 ) week patient 's audio-recorded treatment decision-making visit surgeon . This roughly approximate time frame study activity patient surgery . Patients family member also allow complete follow survey ( T2 T3 ) web survey mail , prefer , though phone survey likely primary data collection method , base prior research . Some patient Visit 1 Surgeons need additional testing ( CT scan , PET scan , stress test ) treatment decision make . These patient family member complete initial study activity ( audio record initial visit surgeon ( T0 ) survey 12-72 hour ( T1 ) ) . Study staff audio record second ( return ) visit surgeon repeat post visit survey ( T1 ) . The second third survey link treatment decision second interaction surgeon : T2 : 1-2 week postoperatively T3 : 6-8 week postoperatively , T2 : 6-8 T3:12-14 week second interaction surgeon non-operative treatment . In case surgeon telephone patient additional testing develop treatment plan . Study staff audio record interaction . Study staff use careful chart review communication surgeon and/or his/her clinical staff patient accurately target time subsequent study activity . After final survey complete study staff use chart abstraction identify record treatments receive postoperative complication . Study staff use chart review immediately patient meet surgeon ( T0 ) final survey ( T3 ) complete record clinical data , treatment receive outcomes treatment . Study staff also screen chart enrol patient weekly order confirm treatment plan may unclear time audio-recorded treatment decision-making visit critically important timing subsequent data collection . Data collect limited clinical information pertain surgical care audio-recorded treatment decision-making visit administration final survey ( T3 ) . To investigate Aim 3 , investigator use qualitative study design compare interpersonal intrapersonal conflict study arm relate phenomenon surgical buy inâ€”when surgeon believe patient agree operative procedure well possible postoperative care . Conflict surgeon patient and/or family member additional invasive procedure occur uncommon set serious postoperative complication may affect QPL intervention , include question `` What happen thing go wrong ? '' specific question prompt advance directive . Thus , investigator use stratify purposeful sample identify subset patient experience serious postoperative complication study arm , determine chart review . Serious complication include prolonged hospitalization ( 8 day postoperatively ) , prolonged length stay intensive care ( great 3 day ) , prolonged mechanical ventilation , myocardial infarction , major cerebrovascular accident , new onset dialysis death . Study staff use chart review T3 ( 12-14 week , roughly 6 week surgery ) identify patient serious complication ask and/or family member participate face-to-face qualitative interview . The investigator plan 3-7 interview study site anticipate 10 site . Not patient consent Aims 1 2 study participate Aim 3 . For patient family member agree interview , trained Qualitative Interviewer conduct interview . The interviewer meet patient family member convenient private location choose in-person interview . Patients family member choice conduct interview jointly separately . Study investigator employ technique previous study successfully interview study participant family member home medical center private room time follow medical appointment . Interviews generally conduct telephone limit ability interviewer respond non-verbal cue . Interviews last one hour .</detailed_description>
