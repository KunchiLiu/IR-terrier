	<brief_summary>Dermatological surgeon wear many hat care subject skin cancer . While role cancerous tissue removal result superior cure rate , also need skilled excisional repair effective wound heal regimen subject heal least amount scar necessary . As , numerous technique develop reduce morbidity associate excessive scarring . Various flaps graft allow surgeon approximate skin texture , thickness adnexa respect residual surround tissue . However , optimal cosmetic functional outcome , specific suture technique often necessary ensure close wound approximation simultaneously minimize static tension along wound edge . In addition , post-operative technique wound care range special dressing various stage heal cosmetic procedure scar modification . Unfortunately , operation complete , little surgeon minimize adverse scar formation without impair heal process . To date , surgical wound allow heal least partially scar revision modulation attempt . Botulinum toxin present unique opportunity surgeon affect scar formation throughout duration heal process . These effect likely independent adjunctive wound care technique , primarily attribute reduction dynamic tension wound edge . Most importantly , botulinum toxin 's one time dosing requirement respect reduce scar formation precludes variance inherent standard wound care practice . Therefore , propose select subject , botulinum toxin may safe , effective reliable mean improve post-excisional repair outcome . Botulinum toxin investigate inhibitor excessive , post-excisional scar formation plastic surgery Otorhinolaryngology literature . However , promise study yet combine objective assessment measure human scar formation randomize control trial . In addition , currently formal study botulinum toxin prophylactic excess scar dermatological literature . Fortunately , Botulinum toxin dose forehead purpose inhibit excessive scar formation comparable amount give cosmetic purpose , commonplace dermatology well-studied .</brief_summary>
