	<brief_summary>Study Design : Phase 4 , pilot , single center , observational study . MEP 's obtained twice , two week apart baseline every 6 month 36 month ( total 14 session MEP 's ) MEP 's include : 1 . Onset latencies CMCT bilateral abductor pollicis brevis tibialis anterior muscle 2 . MEP amplitudes ratio central peripherally obtain motor amplitude ( MEP-M ratio ) bilateral abductor pollicis brevis tibialis anterior muscle Clinical measure ( EDSS , MEP 's , T25FWT , 6MWT , 9HPT ) obtain baseline every 6 month 36 month . Study location : Single center Canada Study Objectives : Primary : To evaluate reliability MEP 's Alemtuzumab treat MS patient 36 month period . Secondary : To determine degree correlation MEP 's presently use clinical measure efficacy ( EDSS , 6MWT , T25FWT , 9HPT ) determine MEP 's predict require third cycle Alemtuzumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alemtuzumab pivotal study show robust effect relapse rate MRI parametric . The effect disease progression however reach statistical significance CARE MS I Clinical trial , especially progressive form Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) greatly hamper insensitivity Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) especially either end scale . Other recently introduce clinical scale time 25 foot walk test ( T25FWT ) , six minute walk test ( 6MWT ) 9-hole peg test ( 9HPT ) also lack sensitivity reliability . A validated , sensitive reliable biomarker disability progression regression would greatly help clinical research MS . Such biomarker could also help evaluate patient would require retreatments Alemtuzumab . Motor evoke potential ( MEP 's ) measure integrity function corticospinal tract . The procedure use electromagnet induce directly via interneurons small depolarize current axon hillock large pyramidal neuron motor cortex . A subsequent motor response measure targeted limb muscle . The amplitude latency response measure give indication conduction integrity corticospinal tract ( CST ) cortex limb . MEP 's able detect perhaps even clinical measure , evidence CST involvement deterioration increase central motor conduction time and/or reduce ratio centrally elicit MEP amplitude peripherally elicit compound motor amplitude potential ( CMAP ) . MEP 's studied variety pathology involve CST 's . MEP 's patient cervical spondylosis well patient amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , show sensitive clinical examination detect CST involvement . MEP 's show MS correlate EDSS score . In study look spinal cord injury patient MEP 's able demonstrate improvement central motor conduction time ( CMCT ) induce extended release fampridine . The main critique MEP 's electrophysiological test one high intra-patient variability compound non-standardized technique center . Newer MEP technique use neuro-navigation , standardized facilitation technique choose best three response significantly reduce inherent variability obtain value . We believe technique MEP 's become useful surrogate biomarker clinical trial MS . The latter however need validated prospective manner .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis MS ( McDonald criterion ) age 18 old ; Subjects meet prescribe criterion Alemtuzumab per product monograph ; An EDSS 5.0 less pyramidal system functional assessment score 2 great ; Subject receive first cycle Alemtuzumab within last 3 month . Subjects begin use extended release Fampridine within 2 month study baseline visit ( Patient stable dose extended release Fampridine 2 month enter study ) ; Subjects MSSS ( Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score ) less 4.0 ; Subject medical condition involve CST 's ; Any condition would preclude undergoing MEP 's and/or MRI .</criteria>
