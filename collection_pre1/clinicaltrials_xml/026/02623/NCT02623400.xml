	<detailed_description>Project goal impact societal challenge : Objective 1 : The first goal project identify objective stress marker obtain easily non-invasively preterm infant NICU hospitalization . This include development novel technique measure stress relate heart rate variability ( HRV ) EEG maturation , well sleep stage marker . On societal economical level , reliable measure degree distress hospitalize preterm infant enable evaluation direct effect stress-reducing intervention NICU architecture change early intervention program cost benefit analysis . ( Work package 1 ) Objective 2 : Second , investigator aim study emotional bonding process parent preterm infant . Parental distress term depressive symptom , anxiety , perceive stress parent-infant bonding measure multiple time point . This lead validation psychometric instrument specific population parent preterm infant . Also , investigator investigate effect predictive value course parental depression , anxiety stress child 's developmental outcome parent-infant bonding attachment . Knowledge short long term risk parental emotional distress important implement sufficient tailor support parent . ( Work package 2 ) Objective 3 : Third , study epigenetic change due prenatal stress still scarce human . Recently , preliminary evidence find prenatal stress affect methylation state NR3C1promotor region ( Hompes et al. , 2013 ) . In study , investigator include cohort mother experience profound prenatal stress due preterm labor , complement earlier work carry low-risk population . The investigator expect profound change methylation state NR3C1 promotor region cohort . The methylation oxytocin receptor gene also study relation attachment bonding . On societal level , knowledge impact adverse maternal psychological well-being pregnancy epigenome important , example justify prevention campaign . ( Work package 3 ) Overall objective : An important overall goal project develop Perinatal Stress Calculator combine value different neonatal , endocrinological , psychological physiological stress-related parameter predict difference psychomotor , cognitive , behavioural , emotional development ( Work package 5 ) . This prospective longitudinal study design enable investigator use perinatal stress calculator study relation perinatal stress parameter later developmental disability motor impairment , cognitive deficit , language delay also social behavioural problem attentional deficit emotional self-regulation dysfunction ( Work package 4 ) . The investigator able weigh perinatal infant characteristic model , also parental characteristic distress , resilience personality well bond attachment measure . On societal economic level , result project important health policy decision-making . Improved prediction developmental trajectory preterm infant could lead earlier targeted intervention decrease maladaptive outcome .</detailed_description>
