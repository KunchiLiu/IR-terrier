	<detailed_description>Influenza infection solid organ transplant recipient associate increased morbidity mortality compare non-transplanted control , due part effect immunosuppression necessary prevent rejection transplant organ . Annual influenza vaccination best way prevent influenza infection current CDC , AST Infectious Diseases Community Practice American Society Blood Marrow Transplantation guideline recommend annual influenza vaccination transplant recipient . However , transplant patient less likely produce antibody vaccinate , peak duration antibody responses reduce compare healthy control . There considerable difference magnitude response , reflect variability individual response influenza vaccine immunosuppression regimen . Over past several year , investigator conduct Phase 2 clinical trial combine kidney stem cell transplantation successful achieve transplantation tolerance significant number recipient . A central tenant transplantation tolerance selective loss immune reactivity allograft preserve immune response antigen . The investigator hypothesize chimeric kidney transplant recipient immunosuppression post vaccine immune response comparable age gender match healthy control . The proposed study aim assess immune competence fully chimeric tolerant recipient , quantify T B cell responses 2015-2016 inactivated influenza vaccine , quadrivalent ( IIV4 ) , standard dose test whether respond T B cell arise memory cell recipient origin . These study allow investigator quantify influenza -specific cellular , humoral , molecular response IIV4 tolerant vs. match control . On day 0 30 day post -IIV4 , flu-specific B cell neutralize antibody response , flu-specific IFN-gamma T cell response quantify . Additionally , investigator perform genome-wide gene expression profile isolated PBMC day 0 30 post-IIV4 characterize blood response transcriptome level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults receive either combined kidney/stem cell transplant achieve chimerism posttransplant recipient maintain standard immunosuppressive therapy . Additionally , healthy control either gender â‰¥ 18 year age also recruit . Subjects must willing able receive IIV4 provide blood sample research visit . Subjects must willing able read , understand , capable give informed consent prospective enrollment . Exclusion Criteria Subjects le 18 year age . Any condition , opinion attend physician , would place patient undue risk participate . Specific condition include limited anemia prohibitive phlebotomy , coagulopathy inability receive IIV4 .</criteria>
