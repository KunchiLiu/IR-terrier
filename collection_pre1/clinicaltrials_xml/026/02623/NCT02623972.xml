	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Eribulin Followed AC Preoperative Therapy HER2-negative Inflammatory Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention studied.. Eribulin work interfere cancer cell division , growth , spread . The goal research study evaluate inflammatory breast cancer 's response treatment eribulin follow AC chemotherapy give preoperative chemotherapy treatment participant HER2 negative inflammatory breast cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer . All histologic subtypes eligible . Patients must know HER2 status define negative ( define IHC 0 1+ , FISH ratio &lt; 2.0 ) . Any ER PR status allow . Age ≥18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use eribulin participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study ECOG performance status ≤1 ( Karnofsky ≥70 % , see Appendix A ) Participants must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Patients must clinical diagnosis inflammatory breast cancer evidence onset sign symptom note within 6 month timeperiod : Erythema breast Edema skin breast Enlargement breast Patients must without evidence visceral bone involvement metastatic cancer physical exam diagnostic study . Extensive nodal involvement allow . LVEF &gt; 50 % calculate echocardiogram ( ECHO ) Patients may bilateral breast cancer long one breast meet criteria inflammatory breast cancer , neither breast cancer receive prior therapy . The effect eribulin develop human fetus unknown . For reason therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion eribulin administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial . Because breast cancer predominantly affect female , anticipate male enrollment &lt; 5 % overall study population . Participants receive investigational agent . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients evidence metastatic disease involvement viscera bone . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition eribulin agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study eribulin agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother eribulin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated eribulin . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction eribulin . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . A baseline correct QT interval &gt; 470 m . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 3 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 3 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients may receive paclitaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide antineoplastic therapy .</criteria>
