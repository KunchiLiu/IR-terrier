	<brief_summary>The high prevalence myopia - especially Asian country - well document , sight-threatening complication high degenerative myopia . Retinal detachment , glaucoma , vitreal degeneration focal retinal change occur secondary progressive axial elongation eye age . Specialty rigid lens long show lessen progression pediatric population ; orthokeratology ( ortho-k ) lenses worn night change corneal topography correct low moderate amount myopia . This axial elongation also show occur young adult high near demand , however knowledge , study examine effect ortho-k lens population . Our project seek investigate efficacy ortho-k slow axial elongation myopic progression subject age 21-30 . Results help elucidate role specialty lenses may management myopic patient throughout development , well potential prevention associate degenerative change .</brief_summary>
