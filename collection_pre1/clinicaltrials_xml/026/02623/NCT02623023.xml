	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect prophylactic treatment brimonidine/timolol fix combination ( Combigan® , Allergan ; Dublin , IRL ) placebo therapy ( Refresh tears® , Allergan ; Dublin , IRL ) long-term IOP measurement patient receive serial intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab ( 0.05 mL ) six month follow-up . Intraocular pressure measurement correlate change ancillary testing ( Humphrey 24-2 visual field test optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) optic nerve head ( ONH ) . Our study would first large , prospective , randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial examine relationship anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) therapy sustain ocular hypertension .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The recent introduction antivascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) agent quickly progress become standard care several ocular disease . Between 2006 2010 , anti-VEGF treatment neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) initiate 620 000 eye Medicare beneficiary United States . This paradigm shift retinal therapy stem evidence VEGF regulate angiogenesis vascular permeability , process characterize pathophysiology diabetic retinopathy AMD . Several large multicenter , randomize clinical trial demonstrate patient neovascular AMD clinically significant macular edema ( CSME ) benefit frequent intravitreal anti-VEGF injection , particularly ranibizumab . Ranibizumab humanize monoclonal antibody Fab fragment ( IgG1 ) inhibit identify VEGF isoforms , include VEGF165 , VEGF121 VEGF110 . Rigorous study consistently demonstrate good relative safety profile anti-VEGF agent . While transient rise intraocular pressure ( IOP ) know effect immediately follow intravitreal injection ( IVI ) , sustain IOP elevation initially report patient undergo anti-VEGF therapy . It post-hoc analysis MARINA , ANCHOR AND VIEW trial significant long-term effect IOP ranibizumab detect . However , increase report literature document phenomenon . Bakri et al . report case series ocular hypertension ( OHT ) ( IOP range 30 - 50 mm Hg ) 0.05 mL intravitreal ranibizumab , persist required treatment . Kahook et al . publish case series six patient undergoing anti-VEGF therapy develop persistent OHT , two prior diagnosis glaucoma/glaucoma suspect . In large , retrospective review 215 patient treated IVI Good et al. , 6 % patient require medical laser treatment sustain IOP elevation . Subgroup analysis reveal patient history glaucoma substantially high likelihood experience sustain IOP elevation , despite low median number IVI non-glaucoma group . In retrospective study Choi et al . , seven 127 patient ( 5.5 % ) develop sustain OHT study eye , whereas fellow eye demonstrate stable IOP . Two large retrospective series report similar incidence persistent IOP elevation , review literature reveal incidence 3.45 % 11.6 % patient neovascular AMD . Post-hoc analysis large , multi-center randomized clinical trial treatment diabetic CSME find ranibizumab group 3-fold increase risk sustain IOP elevation 3 year compare sham-injection group . This study enroll patient history glaucoma/glaucoma suspect , thus could define risk ratio . A prospective study 217 eye undergo anti-VEGF IVI find persistent IOP elevation frequent outcome , IOP peak significantly correlate number injection . Further , patient prior diagnosis glaucoma/glaucoma suspect incidence 12.9 % sustain OHT , compare 3.2 % non-glaucoma subgroup . The pathogenesis persistent ocular hypertension yet elucidate , may secondary chemical damage trabecular meshwork anti-VEGF agent , mechanically micro-particle obstruction . Some study indicate number IVI independent risk factor development long-term ocular hypertension , patient pre-existing glaucoma particularly vulnerable . Transient IOP elevation follow anti-VEGF injection note 30 minute post-injection rarely require anterior chamber paracentesis treatment . Though rise IOP elevation expect return baseline 1-hour post-IVI , long-term consequence phenomenon unknown . One propose mechanism transient effect IOP increase volume intraocular content injection . Gismondi et al find significant relationship shorter axial length higher transient IOP follow intravitreal ranibizumab . One group design randomize control trial evaluate effect preventative treatment short-term rise IOP . Brimonidine/timolol fixed combination ( Combigan® , Allergan ; Dublin , IRL ) administer twice day day prior injection day treatment , reduce rapid increase post-injection IOP safe effective manner . However , study evaluate incidence persistent OHT . As IOP elevation strongly link development glaucoma , potential outcome patient undergo anti-VEGF therapy warrant attention . The data publish topic date primarily comprise retrospective chart review , case series , post-hoc analysis MARINA , ANCHOR Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network 2010 VIEW trial . Many study reveal inconsistent methodology term IOP measurement IVI technique . Ultimately , consensus factor may predispose patient development iatrogenic IOP elevation follow anti-VEGF therapy . Further , prophylactic treatment sustain OHT prospectively study . Currently , guideline IOP monitoring patient undergoing anti-VEGF therapy . Our study aim define treatment algorithm monitor prophylaxis anti-VEGF-related iatrogenic ocular hypertension . This may also shed light possible mechanism post-injection IOP spike . Further , research may help identify subgroup patient vulnerable long-term sequela result phenomenon .</detailed_description>
