	<brief_summary>The traditional paradigm relies upon train physician nurses use on-site interventionists perform screening , brief intervention , referral treatment ( SBIRT ) alcohol prove unsustainable clinical setting . The Remote Brief Intervention Referral Treatment ( R-BIRT ) alcohol innovative telehealth service model potential improve public health evidence base counsel patient exceed NIAAA low risk drink limit evidence Alcohol Use Disorder professional self-help treatment . For appropriate , R-BIRT service provide facilitate referral specialize alcohol abuse treatment . The service model study emergency department ( ED ) set demonstrate utility medical setting high prevalence risky alcohol use Alcohol Use Disorders ; however , model relevant accessible broad array healthcare setting , include primary care practice .

	<detailed_description>Significance : The USPHSTF , SAMHSA , CDC , NIAAA affirm importance screen medical setting alcohol consumption exceed NIAAA low risk limit , brief educational motivational counsel screen positive evidence Alcohol Use Disorder , , appropriate , referral treatment ( SBIRT ) . However , translation clinical practice continue elusive . Polaris Health Directions ( Small Business ) University Massachusetts Medical School ( Research Institute ) partner solve problem create Remote Brief Intervention Referral Treatment service alcohol ( R-BIRT ) , telehealth service deliver evidence base alcohol brief intervention referral treatment medical encounter cost-effective , sustainable way . Investigators : The investigator extensive expertise SBIRT alcohol ( Boudreaux , Bernstein ) ; telehealth ( Boudreaux ) ; development , test , marketing behavioral intervention technology ( Boudreaux , Harralson ) ; comparative effectiveness trial design analysis ( Barton ) ; health economics ( Sachs ) . Combined , team 100 publication related SBIRT constituent technology domain . Innovation : This Phase 2 STTR pioneer telehealth delivery SBIRT alcohol . It flexible enough variety medical setting , develop expand software capable facilitate telehealth in-person SBIRT delivery model . It innovate SBIRT research clinical practice explore mechanisms action , objective rarely incorporate SBIRT study . Approach : The design two arm , single blind ( outcomes assessor ) , randomize , non-inferiority trial . Emergency department ( ED ) patient ( n=356 ) drink NIAAA low risk limit evidence Alcohol Use Disorder randomize telehealth model ( R-BIRT ) gold-standard in-person intervention ( SBIRT ) follow 6 month post-visit use multi-method outcome attainment plan . The study establish non-inferiority telehealth model compare in-person model reduce alcohol use alcohol related consequence , show telehealth model cost effective two . Mechanisms action , include patient knowledge low risk drinking limit , motivation , self-efficacy , substance abuse treatment initiation , self-help program engagement , examine . Environment : With success R-BIRT Phase 1 relevant project , include previous large scale Phase 2 STTR clinical trial , Polaris UMass clearly establish capability successfully carry study , disseminate result , marketing final product . Impact : Because alcohol misuse , abuse , dependence carry enormous burden human suffer healthcare cost , strategy provide high quality , evidence base care manner cost effective easy exist model potential exert substantial impact public health .</detailed_description>
