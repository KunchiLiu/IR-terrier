	<brief_title>Triple-branch Stent Graft Placement Total-arch Replacement Treatment Acute DeBakey I Aortic Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From November 2015 , 90 consective patient acute DeBakey I aortic dissection five-centers China treat triple-branched stent placement hemi-arch replacement . The distribution patient adopt dynamic random variance minimization random method . About half patient assign stent-graft group , hemi-arch group . In case , surgery perform general anesthesia tracheal intubation cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . During surgery arterial pressure upper low limb monitor . An esophageal echocardiography probe place routinely , sternal incision perform . To establish CPB , perfusion tube place right axillary artery drainage tube place superior inferior vena cava right atrium . The CPB flow rate 2.4-2.6 L/kg/min . Intermittent cold blood cardioplegia perfuse left right coronary artery myocardial protection . In stent-graft group , innominate artery left common carotid artery fully isolated CPB cooling process . The ascend aorta proximal innominate artery occlude , ascend aorta transect slightly sinus tube connection ; leave right coronary artery directly perfuse blood-containing cold cardioplegia . Proximal procedure aortic valve repair , sinus reconstruction , root replacement perform first . Afterwards , stump reconstruct . The reconstructed aortic root stump anastomose Dacron graft correspond size use 4-0 polypropylene suture ( ascend aorta replacement ) . The nasopharyngeal temperature decrease 25° ( usually rectal temperature 27-29°C ) , aortic perfusion flow set 10-15 ml/kg/min , innominate artery leave common carotid artery occlude 5-6 cm aortic arch . The aortic occlusion clamp remove half aortic arch transection make 2 cm proximal innominate artery . Through incision , true lumens aortic arch , proximal descend aorta , three aortic branch identify . The triple-branched stent graft insert true lumen aortic arch proximal descend aorta ; three stent graft branch place correspond true lumen aortic arch branch vessel follow sequential release vascular stent backbone branch stent leave subclavian artery , leave common carotid artery , innominate artery . A catheter balloon probe use expand vascular stent graft branch examine kink fold backbone . A sandwich reconstruction perform aortic stump , aortic external Dacron graft , proximal stentless suture zone intraluminal artificial vessel backbone . The reconstructed stump anastomose Dacron graft replace ascend aorta use 4-0 polypropylene suture . The occlusion leave common carotid artery innominate artery relieve , air fully flush heart aorta . The right axilliary artery perfusion stop , systemic perfusion via aortic perfusion tube artificial portion ascend aorta perform . The patient rewarmed oxygen debt repayment , follow cardiac resuscitation . In total-arch group , ascend aorta proximal innominate artery block CPB cool process , ascend aorta incise transect slightly sinus tube connection . The left right coronary artery directly perfuse blood-containing cold cardioplegia . As stent-graft group , proximal procedure perform first . The reconstructed aortic root stump suture Dacron graft use 4-0 polypropylene suture ( ascend aorta replacement ) . The nasopharyngeal temperature decrease 25° ( usually rectal temperature 27-29°C ) aortic perfusion flow set 10-15 ml/kg/min . The innominate artery leave common carotid artery clamp 5-6 cm aortic arch aortic occlusion clamp remove . Half aortic arch resection perform along great curvature aortic arch 1 cm proximal innominate artery lesser curvature aortic arch origin descend aorta . Stumps dissection slice line cotty slice reconstruct use sandwich method anastomose Dacron graft correspond size shape use 4-0 polypropylene suture . Finally , proximal end anastomose artificial blood vessel use 4-0 polypropylene suture . Air fully flush heart aorta . The right auxiliary artery perfusion stop systemic perfusion via aortic perfusion tube artificial blood vessel ascend aorta perform . The patient rewarmed oxygen debt repayment , follow cardiac resuscitation . Telephone contact maintain patient discharge . At 3,6,12 month postoperatively , patient receive follow-up examination , chest radiography , echocardiography , bilateral carotid artery Doppler examination CT angiography ( CTA ) examinations Numerical data express percentage , comparison group perform chi-square test . Quantitative data express mean ± standard deviation ; independent sample test use group comparison pair t-test used compare group surgery . The primary end point occlude rate false lumen one year postoperatively . The secondary end point survive rate , complication , reoperation rate , growth rate thoracic descend aorta , security index peioperatively , life quality postoperatively.Statistical analysis perform SPSS 11.5 software . A value P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
