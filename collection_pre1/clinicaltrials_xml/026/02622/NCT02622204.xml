	<brief_title>The Effect High Tibial Osteotomy Vivo Cartilage Mechanobiology Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although osteoarthritis ( OA ) common degenerative joint disease despite international research effort , date factor involve initiation progression debilitate disease poorly understood , diagnostic marker lack cure . High tibial osteotomy ( HTO ) well-accepted therapy patient knee OA varus alignment aim re-establishing even distribution ambulatory load affect medial knee compartment lateral knee compartment . However , survival rate HTO around 75 % 5 year . There evidence change ambulatory load HTO may relevant post-operative static alignment although relationship yet investigate . Because large change ambulatory load HTO , investigator propose HTO may serve valuable model study effect change ambulatory load vivo cartilage mechanobiology patient knee osteoarthritis . Our previous work show serum biomarkers cartilage increase 30-minute walk exercise ( term 'walking stress test ' ) indicate change may associate accumulated ambulatory load test . Patients medial compartment knee OA varus alignment clinically assess ( include mechanical axis measurement radiograph ) complete questionnaire physical function prior medial opening wedge HTO . Patients complete walk stress test blood sample assess load-induced change serum biomarker concentration , undergo gait analysis assess external knee adduction moment . Once full load bearing achieve , mechanical axis measure radiograph . Patients complete questionnaire second walk stress test blood sample undergo gait analysis 6 month HTO . At 12-month follow-up , subject complete questionnaire .</detailed_description>
