	<brief_summary>This experimental study look effect INP therapy two patient group : 1 ) patient reduced peripheral circulation chronic wound patient renal disease ( dialysis patient ) ; 2 ) peripheral arterial disease leg ulcer . The project design non-randomized clinical trial single-subject multiple baseline design . Also intervention subject leg individual throughout study period . The leg act control . A baseline measure patient history collection perform four-week intervention period . These measure include : Segmental pulse-volume-recording , Segmental skin perfusion pressure laser Doppler sensor pressure cuff evaluate reactive hyperemia ( Sensilase , Väsamed ) health survey ( SF-12/EQ-5D-5L ) similar . After four week eight week intervention , test repeat . A final follow-up test two week cessation intermittent negative pressure intervention . The study look effect INP renal failure patient give dialysis dialysis center locate Oslo University Hospital , Ullevål . Otivio AS supply FlowOx device provide necessary training perform project . Outcome variable assess , 10-week study period : wound healing , quality life , skin perfusion pressure segmental pulse-volume recording . The aim project prospectively examine elucidate effect intermittent negative pressure therapy clinically relevant measure relate reduction peripheral macro- microcirculation patient renal failure undergoing dialysis treatment . The hypothesis study : - Application INP patient renal failure , use FlowOx™ device , improve wound heal peripheral circulation foot compare treatment ( baseline ) patient undergoing dialysis treatment . - Application INP patient PAD , use FlowOx™ device , improve macro- microcirculation wound heal foot compare treatment ( baseline ) patient chronic wound .</brief_summary>
