	<brief_title>Speech Short-term Memory Functions Dyslexia : Combined MEG EEG Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background Developmental dyslexia prevalent learn disorder impair reading skill even individual normal intelligence full availability education ( Lyon et al. , 2003 ) . It highly heritable , several candidate gene contribute dyslexia identify ( Scerri &amp; Schulte-Körne , 2010 ) . A wide range deficit associate dyslexia , accord prevalent theory major cause impair phonological processing ( Ramus , 2001 ) . The MMN , generator overlap brain area report anatomical abnormality dyslexia , supported notion . Diminished MMN amplitudes systematically report dyslexics certain speech non-speech sound feature ( review Kujala &amp; Näätänen , 2001 ) . These effect even find child infant inherit risk dyslexia ( Leppänen et al. , 2002 ; Lovio et al. , 2010 ) . Furthermore , recent study group show dyslexic child problem form memory trace word ( Kimppa et al. , prep . ) , whereas auditory system normal-reading adult ( Shtyrov et al. , 2010 ) child ( Kimppa et al. , prep . ) show rapidly form representation novel word . It recently suggest phonological deficit dyslexia occur due impairment different step sound processing . According theory , dyslexic individual divide different subgroup . Ramus colleague ( 2013 ) suggest dyslexic individual show impairment phonological representation later process stage impairment phonological skill . The current project utilize combine electroencephalographic ( EEG ) magnetoencephalographic ( MEG ) record neuropsychological perceptual testing order determine impair phonological neural representation vs. phonological skill contribute dyslexia . Defined time-locked change external stimulus EEG magnetoencephalogram MEG , event-related potential ( ERPs ) event-related field ( ERFs ) , respectively , could provide objective index information process human brain . Both EEG MEG method offer high temporal resolution . The benefit MEG offer exact localization activate neural source due diminish effect distortion cause skull tissue process EEG source localization . It complement add specific information dyslexia ERP research additional previous study mostly conduct EEG . For summary dyslexia study conduct MEG , see review Salmelin ( 2007 ) . Neural response record EEG MEG widely use service basic research clinically-oriented research . During recent year , cortical response call mismatch negativity ( MMN ) intensive use investigate auditory perception deficit . MMN ERP component elicit change repetitive aspect auditory stimulation , peak 100-200 m change onset detectable electrically ( MMN ) magnetically ( MMNm ) . It suggest MMN provide index auditory sensory ( `` echoic '' ) memory automatic ( involuntary ) change-detection . It also reflect native-language specific speech-sound memory trace ( Näätänen et al. , 1997 ) . MMN elicit even subject attend auditory stimulus . Therefore , popular investigate variety patient group recent year ( review , see Näätänen et al. , 2007 ; Kujala et al. , 2007 ) . In addition processing syllable ( pseudo- ) word , neural activity comprehension complex real-life speech record single-trial MEG characterized . A model-free analysis method investigate inter-subject correlation ( ISC ) individual without dyslexia . This approach give insight auditory processing characteristic natural condition . The method ISC proven viable research natural condition , e.g . movie watch listen music , mainly use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . It introduce Hasson colleague 2004 , find brain region synchronize subject movie viewing . In MEG , approach use scarcely ( e.g . Lankinen et al. , 2014 ; Suppanen , 2014 ; Thiede , 2014 ) . However , confirm complement result fMRI research . In language research , temporal correlation investigate ISC method , report rest state network child read difficulty ( Dimitriadis et al. , 2013 ) . The result confirm finding fMRI study . Thus , method offer new , promising insight neural underpinnings dyslexia . Developmental dyslexia heritable disorder polygenic origin . Several candidate gene detect recent year ( Kere , 2014 review ) , associate function neuronal migration auditory processing . However , connection auditory response brain genetic cause disorder confirm yet . More research connection genetic neural marker dyslexia need order verify different exist hypothesis . Previous activity Research experimenter group show group level , cortical low-level discrimination sound speech sound impaired dyslexia ( Kujala , 2007 review ) . This reflect diminished MMN response ( e.g. , Kujala et al. , 2006 ; Schulte-Körne et al. , 1998 ; Neuhoff et al. , 2012 ) enhancement MMNs result dyslexia intervention ( Kujala et al. , 2001 ; Lovio et al. , 2012 ) . These result suggest strong connection neural response dyslexia . Furthermore , investigator ' result suggest weak association neural representation speech sound write letter brain dyslexics ( Mittag et al. , 2013 ) , could reflect deficit phonological skill dyslexia . Furthermore , study carry current research group lead identification candidate gene dyslexia ( e.g . Hannula-Jouppi et al. , 2005 ; Schumacher et al. , 2006 ) . In recent review , nine gene four gene locus list summary genetic locus associate developmental dyslexia ( Kere , 2014 ) . Some candidate gene show link axonal connection others neuronal migration function . 2 . Objectives method This study aim determine neurocognitive underpinnings dyslexia connection gene . The target neural process impaired different subgroup dyslexic individual involve phonological representation vs. phonological skill . Phonological representation reflect low-level discrimination speech sound , whereas phonological skill mirror audiovisual integration write spoken letter . With neuropsychological test , determine participant primarily weak speech representation poor phonological skill . It hypothesize participant weak phonological representation diminish MMN/MMNm response . However , participant problem , instead poor phonological skill , expect normal-like MMN/MMNm response deficient response reflect audiovisual integration , difference effect print text versus nonsense visual material early auditory speech discrimination . These two type dyslexic group hypothesize alteration partly different dyslexia candidate gene . Auditory process brain complex , real-world condition investigate use single-trial MEG presentation natural speech sound . It expect synchronized brain activity differs dyslexic control group . Specifically , expect dyslexic subject show decreased synchrony leave temporoparietal cortex ( Temple , 2002 ) . Single-trial data could furthermore show connection gene , suggest Giraud Ramus ( 2013 ) , hypothesize disruption auditory cortical oscillation modifies access phonological representation . Dyslexia know associate several candidate gene ( review , see Kere , 2014 ) . The candidate gene associate language skills brain 's ERPs . The gene research cooperation Prof. Juha Kere 's laboratory Folkhälsan research centre Biomedicum , Helsinki Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , aim proof connection dyslexia candidate gene neural event-related activity brain pseudoword stimulus . Stimuli procedure MMN MMNm responses sound change pseudoword /tata/ ( vowel , vowel duration , syllable frequency change ) record participant attend movie see concurrent visually-presented pseudoword stimulus . During auditory condition , subject watch silence movie present frequent `` standard '' stimulus , namely pseudoword ( /tata/ ) infrequent `` deviant '' ( see ) auditory stimulus . The task attend movie ignore background sound . The audiovisual condition include pseudoword stimulus , instead watch movie , subject see write letter present pseudoword scramble picture pseudoword letter . Distractors , count deviant stimuli different shape colour visual stimulus , give main task participant . They instruct ignore sound . The pseudoword stimulus follow : - standard : /tata/ - vowel deviant : /tato/ - frequency deviant - high frequency 2nd syllable - duration deviant : /tataa/ - 2nd syllable twice long standard The stimulus present combined multi-feature oddball design ( Näätänen et al. , 2004 ) . All deviant type present sequence 1-4 standard successive 2 deviant . In addition record MMNm response , single-trial , continuous record brain activity real-world stimulus record . Approximately 8 min natural speech ( Finnish speaker ) present group task mere listen keep eye open . A record 8 min rest eye open complete addition . In order examine difference general cognitive ability performance profile group , participant undergo behavioural test . Dyslexia characteristic assess part Nevala dyslexia test ( Nevala et al. , 2006 ) . General performance Intelligence Quotient ( IQ ) well phonological work memory test use Wechsler Intelligence Scale ( WAIS-III ; Wechsler , 1997a ) subtests Wechsler Memory Scale ( WMS-III ; Wechsler , 1997b ) . Phonological naming assess rapid alternate stimulus naming ( RAS ) test speed accuracy ( Wolf , 1986 ) . These corresponding neuropsychological test execute max . 2 hour independent test session MEG session . Additionally , saliva blood sample ( 2x9 ml blood ) collect trained nurse subject 's approval . DNA extract sample store Folkhälsan research centre Juha Kere 's laboratory . The DNA analysis focus related candidate gene different variant use DNA sequence technique determine genotype ( Taqman , Sequenom ) . Possible link electric magnetic activity brain candidate gene dyslexia search .</detailed_description>
