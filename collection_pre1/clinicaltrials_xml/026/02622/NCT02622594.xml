	<brief_summary>This investigator initiate , two center , randomize , evaluator-blinded , bilateral ( right vs. leave ) study photodynamic therapy subject facial actinic keratoses . Subject 's face randomize receive one four treatment : Treatment 1 , Treatment 2 , Treatment 3 Treatment 4 . Treatment 1 include microneedling perform prior ALA application right face ALA application leave face 60 minute prior BLUE light treatment 1000 second ( 16 minute 40 second ) . Treatment 2 include microneedling perform prior ALA application leave face ALA application right side face 60 minute prior BLUE light treatment 1000 second ( 16 minute 40 second ) . Treatment 3 include microneedling perform prior ALA application right face ALA application leave side face 30 minute prior BLUE light treatment 1000 second ( 16 minute 40 second ) . Treatment 4 include microneedling perform prior ALA application leave face ALA application right side face 30 minute prior BLUE light treatment 1000 second ( 16 minute 40 second ) . The face define surface skin encompass forehead hair line top eyebrow , entire nasal dorsum , cheek ( bound orbital rim , anterior border ear , jawline , nose chin ) , upper lip ( include vermilion border ) chin ( bound low edge vermilion border , cheek junction jawline ) . The treatment area occlude . A line drawn marker intersects nose , forehead , upper lip chin midline . The left face define face leave line right face define face right line . Posttreatment follow-up visit schedule occur 48 hour treatment 1 , 3 6 month treatment . A blinded evaluator remain blind respect randomization conduct grade subject 's actinic keratoses photodamage . Tolerability treatment assess evaluation local skin response ( erythema , edema , etc . ) conduct unblinded evaluator . Safety evaluate adverse event local skin response report study</brief_summary>
