	<brief_summary>There complex , mutual relationship cancer thrombosis . Indeed , tumor capacity activate hemostatic system lead increase thrombotic risk cancer patient . Even absence clinical manifestation , cancer patient commonly characterize hemostatic abnormality , recognize laboratory testing , define 'hypercoagulable state ' . Of interest , hypercoagulation repeatedly report associated tumor progression poor prognosis various carcinoma . On hand , thrombotic event represent first signal presence occult tumor . These finding suggest coagulant pathway might play role preclinical phase cancer . The investigator hypothesize persistent , subclinical activation hemostatic system otherwise healthy subject , may predispose thrombosis , also tumor formation spread . A major problem primary cancer prevention lack effective predictive marker disease . The HYPERCAN ongoing prospective Italian multicenter study organize around two tightly-interconnected research program aim : 1_the assessment thrombotic marker tool cancer risk prediction two large population healthy subject , i.e . group healthy blood donor Bergamo Milano Provinces subgroup Moli-sani subject Molise region ; 2_ evaluation whether thrombotic marker and/or occurrence overt thrombosis ( disseminated intravascular coagulation ) may prognostic cancer disease outcome ( i.e . overall survival , progression free survival metastatic cancer , disease free survival limited disease ) cancer patient different type solid tumor ( i.e . breast , lung gastrointestinal cancer ) . Therefore , assessment cancer risk occurrence healthy individual might useful anticipation cancer diagnosis . In addition , result study might help evaluate whether thrombotic marker may prognostic cancer outcomes independently disease extension .</brief_summary>
