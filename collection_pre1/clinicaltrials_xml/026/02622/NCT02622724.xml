	<detailed_description>This Phase III clinical study investigate efficacy safety FP-1201-lyo ( recombinant human interferon [ IFN ] beta-1a ) compare placebo patient diagnose moderate severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Primary objective demonstrate efficacy FP-1201-lyo improve clinical course outcome base survival need mechanical ventilation . Currently approve drug treat moderate severe ARDS patient . FP-1201-lyo lyophilise powder form recombinant human IFN beta-1a reconstitute water injection administer intravenously . Recombinant human IFN beta-1a approve treatment patient indication safety profile patient well characterise .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient diagnosis moderate severe ARDS accord Berlin definition ARDS : Acute onset respiratory failure within 1 week know clinical insult new worsen respiratory symptom Respiratory failure associate know ARDS risk factor fully explain either cardiac failure fluid overload ( objective assessment cardiac failure fluid overload need risk factor ARDS [ moderate severe ARDS ] present ) Radiological abnormality chest Xray computerise tomography scan , i.e. , bilateral opacity fully explain effusion , nodule , mass lobar/lung collapse Hypoxaemia : Moderate ARDS : PaO2/FiO2 &gt; 100 mmHg ( &gt; 13.3 kPa ) ≤200 mmHg ( ≤26.6 kPa ) positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) ≥5 cmH2O Severe ARDS : PaO2/FiO2 ≤100 mmHg ( ≤13.3 kPa ) positive end expiratory pressure [ PEEP ] ≥5 centimeter water [ cmH2O ] 2 . The radiological hypoxaemia criterion ( 1.3 1.4 ) must meet within 24hour period . The time onset ARDS last two specify ARDS criterion meet 3 . Administration first dose study drug must plan take place within 48 hour first fulfil inclusion criterion 4 . Patient intubate mechanically ventilated 5 . A sign informed consent form patient patient 's personal legal representative professional legal representative must available 6 . Patient age ≥18 year 1 . Woman know pregnant , lactate positive ( urine serum test ) indeterminate ( serum test ) pregnancy test 2 . Patient simultaneously take part another pharmacotherapy protocol 3 . Patient expect survive 24 hour 4 . Patient underlie clinical condition , opinion Investigator , would extremely unlikely patient would come ventilation , e.g. , motor neurone disease , Duchenne muscular dystrophy rapidly progressive interstitial pulmonary fibrosis 5 . Patient severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require longterm home oxygen therapy mechanical ventilation ( noninvasive ventilation via tracheotomy ) except continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) bilevel positive airway pressure use solely sleepdisordered breathe 6 . Patient congestive heart failure , define New York Heart Association class IV 7 . Patient acute leave ventricular failure 8 . Patient liver failure ( ChildPugh grade C ) 9 . Patient receive prior interferon 10 . Patient know hypersensitivity natural recombinant IFN beta excipients 11 . Patient receive renal dialysis therapy chronic renal failure 12 . Patient receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , highfrequency oscillatory ventilation form extracorporeal lung support 13 . Patient form mechanical ventilation ( invasive noninvasive , exclude CPAP alone ) long 48 hour prior diagnosis ARDS . Noninvasive ventilation continuously apply least 12 hour per day 48 hour 14 . Patient burn ≥15 % total body surface area</criteria>
