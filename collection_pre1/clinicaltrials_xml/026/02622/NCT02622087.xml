In addition , spider also commonly find home garden , thus increase ecological validity study . Participants ask approach spider stepwise manner ( i.e. , 10 step ) . Performance score 10-point scale corresponds step take test ; step 0 = refuse enter room , 1 = stop 3m terrarium , 2 = stop 2m , 3 = stop 1m , 4 = stop close terrarium , 5 = touch terrarium , 6 = remove lid , 7 = put gloved hand terrarium , 8 = touch inside wall floor terrarium , 9 = use chopstick guide spider gloved hand rest floor terrarium . For step 7 9 experimenter relocate spider large enclosure zipper open arrange spider escape enclosure participant provide long sleeved shirt garden glove . Once participant enter room , experimenter persuade participant continue . Detailed Description One-Session-Treatment ( OST ) : There three session . Session 1 involve preparation stage , pre-treatment interview , pre-treatment measure , OST . During pre-treatment interview clinical psychologist collect information participant fear spider provide rationale treatment . The participant complete pre-treatment measure , include BAT ( assess pre-treatment level avoidance ; see detailed protocol ) , well self-report questionnaire . After complete pre-treatment measure , participant begin OST . This treatment strictly follow Öst 's manual specific phobia . It take maximum three hour show highly effective treat specific phobia , include spider phobia . OST involve use maximum 4 spider vary size , 0.5cm 5cm , house glass terrarium . Two spider specie use : St Andrew 's Cross ( Argiope ) Huntsman ( Holconia immanis ) . These spider choose low risk ( non toxic ) non-aggressive human . In addition , spider also commonly find home garden , thus increase ecological validity treatment . There total five step start step , experimenter provide instruction model behaviour participant . Each step repeat participant experience reduction least 50 % anxiety , assess Subjective Units Distress rating ( SUDS ; 0-100 ) , rate conviction belief catastrophe occur 0 ( 0-100 ) . Steps 1-4 complete St Andrew 's Cross spider . Step 1 involves teach participant catch small spider glass postcard ( i.e. , place glass upside spider terrarium slide postcard underneath ) .

The experiment end step complete , maximum 3 hour time limit reach , participant indicate want continue . After treatment , participant check ensure feel distress accompany experimenter Healthscope Pathology provide blood sample verify hormone level . Session 2 , follow-up session , occur one-week later , per Öst 's treatment manual . During session , post-treatment measure take , include structured clinical interview assessment , self-report questionnaire BAT . Session 3 occur 3 month later long-term follow-up session .
