	<brief_summary>Introduction : Population age associate increased prevalence chronic disease . Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) second common neurodegenerative disease world population , affect motor function functional independence progressively . The physiological aging promotes gradual reduction body weight , lung function , peripheral muscle strength , cardiopulmonary endurance physical capacity , increase debilitate effect . Aging , associate PD , induce loss functionality , postural change , affect nutritional status , worsen quality life functional independence individual . Although physical therapy commonly apply variety methodology PD patient , evidence effectiveness intervention lack . Objective : The primary objective study compare effect Functional Training , Stationary Bike Exergaming Exercises proportion faller elderly participant PD . In addition , secondary objective compare effect cardiopulmonary endurance , posture , postural control , executive function , quality life functionality individual PD . Methodology : This interventional , randomize , blind , longitudinal prospective study . This research conduct State Reference Center Health Care Elderly ( CREASI ) . The sample consist 63 individual PD per group . The Experimental Group 1 submit Functional Training , Experimental Group 2 undergo train Stationary Bike Experimental Group 3 submit exergame training use Xbox360 KinectTM sensor . All intervention perform three time per week , 50 minute per session , 8 week .</brief_summary>
