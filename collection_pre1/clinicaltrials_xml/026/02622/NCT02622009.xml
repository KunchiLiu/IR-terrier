	<brief_summary>Background : The presence low-grade viral infection airways patient stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) could potentially implications pathogenesis progression disease , previous study report different rate human rhinovirus ( HRV ) respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) genome detection nasal sputum sample . However , study investigate presence virus directly lung bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) bronchial biopsy . This study aim investigate whether HRV RSV present lung stable COPD patient perform BAL bronchial biopsy , relate presence disease severity . Methods : Consecutive patient stable COPD control subject , underwent diagnostic ( e.g. , lung cancer ) and/or therapeutic ( e.g. , hemoptysis ) fibreoptic bronchoscopy university hospital Athens , Greece , enrol . The collected BAL bronchial biopsy bronchoscopy subsequently process HRV RSV RNA detection real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . More specifically , nucleocapsid gene 5΄ non-coding region search RSV HRV detection , respectively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients control subject The population study consist consecutive patient stable COPD control subject , refer investigator October 2012 November 2014 order undergo fibreoptic bronchoscopy diagnostic ( e.g. , lung cancer ) therapeutic ( e.g. , hemoptysis ) purpose . At study time , clinical functional status COPD patient stable least 4 week , none receive antibiotic treatment last 4 week . Exclusion criterion include atopic history , asthma , extensive pleural effusion , bronchiectasis , immunosuppression due chemotherapy systemic corticosteroid contraindication bronchoscopic procedure . COPD severity classify use postbronchodilator spirometric value accord Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) guideline . Also , patient evaluate accord combine COPD assessment . In classification impact disease individual patient determine combination symptomatic assessment ( CAT mMRC score ) , patient 's spirometric classification and/or risk exacerbation ( number exacerbation history hospitalization due exacerbation precede year ) .The control group consist non-smokers current/ex-smokers without COPD . The ex-smoking condition define cessation smoke habit least 1 year previously . All participant complete questionnaire include demographic characteristic cigarette smoke status ( pack/year ) . Τhe clinical status evaluate accord modify Medical Research Council ( mMRC ) scale breathlessness Body mass , airflow Obstruction , Dyspnea , Exercise ( BODE ) index . Pulmonary function test perform arterial blood gas blood oxygen saturation pulse oximetry sit position measure . Patients ask number characteristic precede exacerbation , number duration precede hospitalization respiratory disorder , past medical history ( asthma , allergy , sinusitis nasal polyp ) , presence comorbidities ( heart disease , malignancy , e.t.c . ) , medication use . Both COPD patient control subject appropriately prepared ( local anesthesia intravenous sedation ) order undergo transnasal fibreoptic bronchoscopy . After routine bronchoscopic inspection tracheobronchial tree , investigator perform BAL subsegmental bronchus bronchial biopsy ( 3-4 per patient ) non infiltrate carina . All sample aliquoted , frozen store within 1 hour sampling . HRV RSV detection RNA sample extract BAL lung biopsy use Maxwell 16 viral total nucleic acid ( Promega ) . A Nucleocapsid ( N ) gene partial sequence , well 5΄ non-coding region ( 5΄NCR ) partial sequence amplify RSV HRV , respectively . Real-time PCR study perform . The primers/probes mix , use , broad homology large range HRV serotypes . Also , primers/probes RSV able distinguish RSV subtypes A B whilst exclude closely relate human Metapneumoviruses . The primer probe mix provide exploit so-called TaqMan principle . A fluorogenic probe include reaction mixture consist DNA probe label 5'-dye 3'-quencher . Besides , probe cleave reporter dye quencher separate . The resulting increase fluorescence could detect range real-time PCR platform . Each time kit use , positive negative control reaction include run .</detailed_description>
