	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate patient ' experience awake surgery brain . Patients therefore must suffer disease make technique awake craniotomy necessary . In detail , investigator perform study order investigate influence fear pain perception surgery patient undergo awake surgery lesion within brain . In event find correlation fear surgery intraoperative pain perception , investigator aim reduce possible fear beforehand . An additional goal investigator identify psychological consequence awake craniotomy timely admit patient adequate therapy necessary . There change regard actual treatment disease . In case consent , patient receive questionnaire three timepoints : 1. day surgery . 2. third day surgery . 3. 3-6 month postoperatively outpatient clinic . The benefit participate study possibility detect psychological consequence awake craniotomy early stage . If require , patient receive treatment timely . There additional risk . Theoretically data risk analysis . Patients free decide want participate within study . There change actual treatment patient deny participation . In case participation , patient right quit time reason . During study investigator collect health-related data . If patient quit study end , data still use pseudonymized form . After 10 year , data destroy . In case participation duty patient fill questionnaire mention three time point . The investigator conduct study base rule law regard data protection . Investigators use collect data relation study . All investigator obligation secrecy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ETHICAL AND REGULATORY ASPECTS Ethical Conduct Study The research project carry accordance research plan principles enunciate current version Declaration Helsinki ( DoH ) , Essentials Good Epidemiological Practice issue Public Health Switzerland ( EGEP ) , Swiss Law Swiss regulatory authority 's requirement applicable . The EC regulatory authority inform project start termination . The Project Leader Project Leader initiate Trial acknowledges responsibility Investigator Project Leader . Risk categorisation Risk category A : Enroled patient expose additional risk , intraoperative mapping brain function use electrical stimulation awake patient actually consider gold standard treatment intracerebral lesion immediate vicinity within eloquent brain region . Ethics Committee ( EC ) Before project conduct , project plan , propose participant information consent form well project-specific document shall submit competent Ethics Committee ( EC ) . The regular end , premature end interruption research project report EC within 90 day upon completion project ( HRO Art . 22 ) . Participant Information Informed Consent Consecutive ongoing recruitment investigator ( ) daily clinical practice ( consultation ) . The subject receive consent form address phone number indicated question regard study discuss directly project leader . This take place least one week hospitalisation . Participant privacy safety The Project Leader affirm upholds principle participant ' right dignity , privacy health project team shall comply applicable privacy law . Especially , anonymity participant shall guarantee present data scientific meeting publish scientific journal . Individual participant medical information obtain result research project consider confidential disclosure third party prohibit . Participant confidentiality ensure utilising identification code number correspond medical information computer file . For data verification purpose , authorise representative Project Leader , competent ethic committee may require direct access part medical record relevant project , include participant ' medical history . Early termination Project The Project Leader ( competent authority ) may terminate project prematurely accord certain circumstance ( insufficient participant recruitment , change project leader reason would prevent project execution accord research plan ) . The premature end interruption research project would report EC within 90 day upon completion project ( HRO Art . 22 ) . Amendments , Changes Significant change project plan would communicate relevant party ( e.g. , investigator , EC ) . The Project Leader would submit EC application document , affected change . At time , project leader would provide information reason change . Substantial amendment implement approval EC . BACKGROUND Intraoperative mapping brain function use electrical stimulation awake patient proven safe technique enables increase tumor removal preserve functional status patient . Former study report conscious experienced procedure generally well tolerated psychological sequela due awake craniotomy seem rare ( Milian et al. , 2014 ) . Fear , anxiety pain commonly see phenomenon intraoperatively ( Milian et al. , 2014 ) . It also know fear anxiety may aggravate pain perception ( Keefe et al. , 2001 ) . The investigator hypothesize patient less preoperative anxiety experience less intraoperative pain . Rationale research Project Potential postoperative psychological sequela could consider affected patient could benefit early recognition treatment . Risk-Benefit Assessment Enroled patient expose additional risk , intraoperative mapping brain function use electrical stimulation awake patient actually consider gold standard treatment intracerebral lesion immediate vicinity within eloquent brain region . Potential postoperative psychological sequela could consider affected patient could benefit early recognition treatment . PROJECT DESIGN Type research general project design Research project health-related personal data collect . Data pseudonymized . Prospective , monocentric , descriptive , cohort study . Overall study duration one year . Patients recruit investigator daily clinical practice , day week prior surgery . Once surgery start study duration patient last 6 month post-surgery . Procedures Standardized questionnaire complete selected patient follow : 1st day preoperatively : MMSE , NRS-anxiety , HADS-D , PDS-1 , BPI , PHQ-D , BDI . Intraoperatively : NRS anxiety pain three timepoints surgery : skin incision , removal bone flap , tumor resection . 3rd day postoperatively : HADS-D , PHQ-D , PDS-1 , BPI , NRS pain . 6 month postoperatively outpatient clinic : PHQ-D , BDI , HADS-D , PDS-1 , BPI . Recruitment Screening Consecutive ongoing recruitment investigator ( ) daily clinical practice ( consultation ) . The subject receive consent form address phone number indicated question regard study discuss directly project leader . This take place least one week hospitalisation . Methods minimise bias The use validate questionnaire . Blinding necessary randomized/different therapy offer . Additional factor consider influence primary secondary endpoint : Assessment gender age . STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY The study non-interventional , monocentric cohort study . The score analyse primary secondary endpoint general assume follow normal distribution . Differences raw ( untransformed ) score change score time , describe descriptive statistic . The hypothesis primary secondary endpoint describe , examined statistical test . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize intraoperative pain perception , measure NRS , patient less preoperative fear anxiety must lower . The score list secondary endpoint hypothesize change pre- post-operative measurement . As expect sample size large enough carry statistical test adequate power , hypothesis test carry study . The evidence difference score primary secondary endpoint discuss base descriptive statistic . Determination Sample Size The primary objective study descriptive nature , i.e. , assess conscious experience experience psychological consequence awake surgery among patient collective Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen ( Kantonsspital St. Gallen , KSSG ) . The number include patient govern duration study , plan one year . Within year expect around 20 patient , recruit KSSG , include study . Statistical criterion termination Trial There statistical criterion , would trigger early termination trial , long data gathering process impair . Planned Analyses The following measure report : mean , standard deviation , 95 % confidence interval , median , 1st 3rd quartile , minimum , maximum . Further descriptive statistic report patient characteristic continuous scale ( e.g . age ) percentages report categorical variable ( e.g . gender ) . The Spearman rank correlation , non-parametric measure correlation , score measure different occasion , report score primary secondary endpoint . Datasets analyse , analysis population The analysis population include eligible patient recruit study . Patients include analysis include questionnaire . Characteristics patient meet inclusion criterion report separately . If patient miss value , miss follow-up visit , observed measurement include data imputation apply . This imply data analyse accord intention treat principle , problematic intervention plan study . Essentially subgroup analysis plan assumption equal group size , descriptive analysis examine score subgroup gender age complement analysis . Primary Analyses Descriptive statistic display NRS score change NRS score pre-operative intra-operative pre-operative post-operative measurement . Secondary Analyses For measure secondary analysis ( PHQ-D , BDI , MMSE , HADS-D , PDS-1 BPI ) descriptive statistic measurement occasion change measure carry . Interim Analyses No interim analysis plan . The duration study one year . However , interim analysis possible requested investigator , data analyse descriptive statistic intervention plan . Deviations original statistical plan Deviations plan statistical analysis document justified final statistical report . Handling miss data drop-outs Patients submit questionnaire exclude analysis . However , patient characteristic patient submit partially submit questionnaire compare determine statistically significant clinically relevant difference two group . This may affect result study interpreted .
