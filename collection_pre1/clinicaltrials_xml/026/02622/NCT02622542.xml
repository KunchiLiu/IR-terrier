	<brief_title>ACute Uncomplicated Type b Aortic Dissection : Endovascular Repair vs. Best Medical Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This prospective , two-arm , parallel-group , single-center , pragmatic , randomized clinical trial . Population : The target population comprise adult patient age 18 year old present uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection . The study sample include 436 subject gender race ethnicity . Procedures : Eligible consented patient enrol study eligibility criterion meet randomly allocate one two study arm : BMT v BMT+TEVAR Study Duration : The study accrue patient course 4 year total follow per patient 5 year . Overall duration study anticipate 9 year Endpoints : - Primary Outcome : To determine all-cause mortality among study arm . - Secondary Outcomes : To assess major morbidity event ( rupture , aortic intervention reintervention , progression complicate dissection , aneurysm formation , malperfusion result organ failure , aorta-specific mortality ) , quality life measure , temporal discounting assessment outcomes comparison observational cohort patient decline randomize due strong treatment preference . Risks Benefits : Since study involve usual care FDA-approved treatment , investigator expect additional physical risk patient beyond associate usual care . One discernible risk involve study participant unintentional disclosure sensitive patient health information . The participant study stand benefit directly take part . However , investigator hope result obtain study would provide useful information would help delineate standard economical management protocol acute Type B aortic dissection future .</detailed_description>
