	<brief_title>Twitter CV Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular ( CV ) disease remain leading cause morbidity mortality US associate significant economic burden . To advance major public health problem , American Heart Association ( AHA ) others identify need targeted focus improve CV health population , emphasize array new tool competency implement public health policy population- community-level intervention complement traditional , predominantly medically orient intervention promote successfully past . Social medium channel like Twitter offer new opportunity explore health relate communication generate public public . Understanding harness new communication channel particular importance digital divide narrow individual across age demographic group increasingly share information online know network friend ( e.g. , Facebook ) , broad network friends others ( e.g. , Twitter ) . Person-to-person word-of-mouth communication one endure persuasive way people deliver receive information . Until recently , person-to-person communication effectively impossible intercept , study , alter . Central proposal recognition change make person-to-person communication observable previously private . It observability new communication channel provide innovation promise area inquiry . This proposal evaluate social medium efferent afferent pathway source communicate community , also learn . There considerable evidence let people know people one effective way increase behavior . This social norming behavior facilitate online share enable others model behavior broad group whose action would invisible therefore uninfluential without new medium channel . For individual chronic illness , automate self-management support ( e.g . mHealth ) online community show improved clinical outcome , patient satisfaction , reduce health care cost utilization . This proposal seek improve CV health reduce burden CV disease understand patient communicate CV health online improve patient ability manage CV disease ( ) . Twitter global social medium platform : Twitter allow user send receive 140-character message refer tweet . Tweets may include embedded web link information news article , home page , picture . Tweets originate single person organization ( tweeter ) distribute broadly individual interest topic tweet individual voluntarily sign follow tweeter . Followers share message follower , process message propagation know re-tweeting . Tweeters choose share information profile ( e.g . age , race , gender , occupation , location , likes/dislikes , picture , webpage link ) . Both patient researcher use health-related Twitter data novel way . In natural disaster ( e.g . Hurricane Sandy , Haiti earthquake ) , Twitter use real time link people need resource . In pandemic ( e.g . H1N1 ) Twitter use surveillance tool target flu hot-spots rapidly traditional data collection tool . Twitters impact organize individual social attitude dramatically reveal 2011 political event Northern Africa . In set Twitter , similar social medium Facebook , allow propagation concentration idea sufficient threaten case topple restrictive government . In non-emergent setting , linguist use Twitter pinpoint local dialect sociologist use tweet forecast mood emotion specific geographic region . Others also use Twitter characterize medical misconception ( e.g . sequelae concussion ) propagation poor medical compliance ( e.g . antibiotic use ) . Studying person-to-person communication : An estimate 400 million tweet post daily 200 million active user . Twitter representative big data increasingly explore good understand online information large , broad population patient . Twitter offer promise research tool due immense scale , immediacy ( example , emergency department Boston learn tragic marathon bombing faster Twitter news establish emergency service communication channel ) , systematic searchability content . Also interest site focus health draw people interest communicate generally , yet include public discourse broad array health topic , perspective patient , provider , policymakers , organization others . Although Twitter user base nationally-representative sample surprisingly deep representation across age , geography , social distribution . African-Americans , Latinos , urban population fact overrepresented Twitter relative general population . This proposal reflect early work , work fundamental develop base understanding scientific use limitation Twitter relate social medium . This proposal aim analyze CV health behavior discuss online evaluate new approach improve access CV health information implement behavior modification .</detailed_description>
