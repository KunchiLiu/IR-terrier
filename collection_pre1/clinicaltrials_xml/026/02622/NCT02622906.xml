	<brief_summary>The angiodysplasias may responsible recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding case bleed remain inaccessible endoscopic treatment . Several observational study suggest treatment somatostatin analogue would reduce transfusion requirement patient recurrent bleed due angiodysplasia . No randomized study available . The main objective study multicenter , prospective , randomize , assess transfusion requirement patient recurrent bleed due angiodysplasia treat new analogue somatostatin , Pasireotide , versus placebo . Patients recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding related angiodysplasias , endoscopic treatment failure , need transfusion least 6 red blood cell 6 month prior inclusion could randomize receive monthly intramuscular injection Pasireotide 60 mg placebo period 6 month . Patients follow additional 6 month stop treatment . A test monthly clinical laboratory perform six month treatment quarterly six month surveillance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The angiodysplasias abnormal communication dilate capillary vein . Their presence digestive tract probably due venous obstruction associate smooth muscle contraction . These vascular malformation particularly significant cause bleed elderly patient . The angiodysplasias responsible 1 % upper gastrointestinal bleed 6 % low bleeding . However case gastrointestinal bleeding obscures presence angiodysplasia find 23 % case exploration small intestine endoscopic video capsule enteroscopy double balloon . Some condition promote development angiodysplasias kidney failure prevalence 13 % case bleed cirrhosis . The responsibility aortic stenosis debate could chance association . On hand , symptomatic bleeding case bleed disorder , particular von Willebrand disease . The first line treatment base destruction endoscopic lesion laser , argon plasma coagulation electrocoagulation . However , lesion may inaccessible endoscopic treatment , numerous patient severe comorbidities , indicate invasive endoscopic treatment . Iterative transfusion remain possible treatment significant proportion patient induces frequent hospitalization , complication related transfusion significant cost . Hormonal treatment try without success prevent rebleeding . Anti-angiogenic thalidomide test phase II trial low number patient . Somatostatin cyclic peptide secrete D cell gastric intestinal mucosa , cell islet Langerrhans . There five know somatostatin receptor activate ligand cause inhibition gastric acid secretion , pancreatic biliary secretion . The somatostatin analogues different vascular effect document downregulation VEGF expression decrease splanchnic flow . Thus , somatostatin analog effect prevention rebleeding secondary angiodysplasia several mechanism : inhibition angiogenesis , reduction splanchnic blood flow , increase vascular resistance increase platelet aggregation . Several cohort study suggest treatment somatostatin analogue , octreotide reduce need transfusion patient recurrent bleed due angiodysplasia . A meta-analysis study , include 62 patient total find relative risk rebleeding 0.76 ( 95 % CI : 0.64 0.85 ) decrease 2.2 transfusion ( 95 % : -3.9 -0.5 ) period treatment period treatment octreotide . To date , randomize phase III study suggest efficacy somatostatin analogues prevention rebleeding due angiodysplasia . Pasireotide new analogue somatostatin high affinity Octreotide like receptor 1 , 3 5 . A preliminary study show pasireotide could effective symptomatic treatment endocrine tumor beyond octreotide therapy . This superior efficacy pasireotide compare Octreotide justifies evaluation pasireotide prevention rebleeding due angiodysplasia . Side effect describe LP pasireotide possibility post prandial hyperglycemia transient dose-dependent . Episodes intestinal disorder report ( diarrhea , nausea , vomit ) , usually require medicinal treatment disappear spontaneously treatment . All data suggests randomize study placebo establish efficacy treatment pasireotide LP prevention rebleeding due angiodysplasia . A randomized phase II feasibility study conduct verify investigator hypotheis follow necessary phase III study . Somatostatin analogs vascular action show pathology ( gastrointestinal bleeding patient portal hypertension ) . Cohort study suggest efficacy reduction transfusion requirement patient gastrointestinal angiodysplasia . In case failure endoscopic treatment currently license treatment prevention rebleeding patient . The investigator objective evaluate reduction number red blood cell transfuse M6 patient treat pasireotide LP placebo .</detailed_description>
