	<brief_summary>Contrast-enhanced MRI common way evaluate neuroepithelial tumor grade monitor tumor recurrence , ability predict tumor behavior remain limited.In study , investigator use multi-b-value diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) , three-dimensional arterial spin labeling ( 3D-ASL ) dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI imaging ( DCE ) evaluate neuroepithelial tumor grade monitor tumor recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Neuroepithelial Tumor Grading Pseudoprogression After Glioma Therapy Using Advanced Functional MRI Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glioma classify 4 grade , bad prognosis advance grades.Previous study suggest different therapeutic strategy apply gliomas different grade , glioma grading operation therefore important clinical significance guide grade-dependent therapeutic strategy . Combination temozolomide radiation significantly prolong survival compare radiation alone become standard treatment Patients high-grade glioma . Response assessment patient difficult result frequent occurrence early imaging change indistinguishable tumor progression , term pseudoprogression . The majority patient remain clinically stable . It often unclear whether current therapy maintain second-line therapy initiate . The ADC value potentially reveal difference cellularity nuclear atypia gliomas1 . Theoretically , high cellularity advance glioma may impede free water diffusion thus lead decrease ADC value.In several previous study , recurrent tumor show significantly high cellularity show pseudoprogression.Such high cellularity associate relative reduction extracellular space compare low cellularity , result decrease diffusivity water molecule former circumstance compare latter . DWI measure degree water diffusion within tissue Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value quantify mobility water molecule cellular level , hold potential differentiate necrosis , edema recurrent tumor . A potential mechanism pseudoprogression radiation-induced vascular change may lead focal transient increase gadolinium enhancement.Three-dimensional arterial spin labeling ( 3D-ASL ) dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE ) MRI image provide noninvasive mean quantify tumor vascular property .</detailed_description>
