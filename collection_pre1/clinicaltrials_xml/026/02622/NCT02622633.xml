	<detailed_description>Exploratory Objectives To analyze hypothetical advantage epidural cortical stimulation compare less invasive method transcranial magnetic stimulation : - Surgical implantation stimulate electrode lead powerful , consistent accurate form stimulation cortex , one main concern associate variability observe study transcranial magnetic stimulation . - A definitive system implantation could also overcome another disadvantage transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy , need repetitive treatment period several week , need maintenance session . - To achieve remission depressive symptom promote improve quality life reduce risk suicide . - To improve patient adherence treatment establishment permanent system . Sample : Patients select outpatient clinic psychiatric ward specialize service Distrito Federal , Brasília , Brazil . These patient include specific outpatient affective disorder University Hospital Brasília . Those patient major depressive disorder consider untreatable conventional method : 1 . The inclusion study require patient meet criterion recurrent Major Depressive Disorder accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual - V ( recurrent Major Depressive Disorder without psychotic feature ) , current depressive episode last least two year produce least four episode major depression , along current episode last least one year . All individual must adults , woman pregnant must submit contraceptive therapy . 2 . Subjects must fail respond least four different trial antidepressant therapeutic dos period least six week , associate specific psychotherapy period and/or use electrochemotherapy vagal nerve stimulation . The medication treatment depression use moment selection remain unchanged least eight week implantation change study period . Possible needs therapeutic adjustment study manage change parameter magnetic stimulation . 3 . Patients score least 20 point Hamilton Rating Scale ( Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-28 ( HDRS ) 4 . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Pregnancy ; 2 . Preexisting neurological disease include epilepsy ; 3 . Other psychiatric disorder except anxiety disorder 4 . Less 24 Mini-Mental cognitive disorder ; 5 . Being serious suicidal ideation . 6 . Medical condition preclude surgery judgment research team . Rating Scales : 1 . Rating Scale Hamilton Depression ( HAM-D ) , 28 item : assessment severity symptom depress patient primary depressive illness monitoring change due treatment . 2 . Depression Scale Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , specific evaluation clinical change depress patient treatment . 3 . Scale SF-36 , evaluate subjectively individual 's perception regard health . 4 . Side Effects Scale ( UKU- Ugvalg Kliniske Undersgelser ) : detail scale assessment drug side effect comprise follow four group side effect : psychic , neurological , autonomic others . Procedures : Selected patient undergo surgical implant procedure perform Surgical Center University Hospital Brasília ( HUB ) . The implant do specialist neurosurgeon treatment functional disorder implantation epidural electrode pathology . The procedure do use neuronavigation implant material already acquire neurosurgery unit HUB direct import . Risks associate surgery : - Risk system infection : 3 % - Risk surgical hematoma : 0.2 % - Risk death : 0.1 % - Risk neurological sequela : 0.1 % Timeline : - Patients select outpatient Psychiatry , University Hospital Brasilia . This clinic conduct psychiatrist psychiatry resident specific patient major depression clinical management difficult . - After obtain informed consent inform consent resolve question participant research , patient agree participate study undergo general physical examination , neurological evaluation , EEG assessment neuropsychological assessment . Depression severity assess Hamilton scale ( HAM-17 ) . Secondary measure depression severity assess Depression Scale Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) Scale SF-36 . - Imaging exam ( Positrons Emission Tomography - PET ) pre-procedure perform . - Psychiatric diagnosis exclude structured interview , include history previous treatment respective drug use , length treatment therapeutic response . - To patient meet inclusion criterion research offer possibility definitive implant epidural electrode . - Realization image examination surgical planning anatomical functional brain assessment . - In case agreement , participant meet inclusion criterion forward implantation epidural electrode HUB train neurosurgeon psychosurgery . - One week implantation device , participant randomize order receive continuous magnetic stimulation high frequency ( 50Hz ) stimulation sham stimulation ( placebo ) first eight week study . After eight week , patient randomize receive sham stimulation receive stimulation 50Hz also eight week . At time participant informed part research group . - Completed eight week continuous stimulation 50 Hz ( eighth week subject stimulation 50Hz sixteenth week make first eight week sham stimulation ) , patient enter adaptive protocol base individual response . - New image test ( PET ) hold 28 week treatment response criterion achieve , whichever come first . - Patients reassess every two week period 16 week reapplication HAM-17 MADRS . During reassessment also investigate possible adverse effect patient device check stimulation . - The result subject statistical analysis order verify effectiveness method .</detailed_description>
