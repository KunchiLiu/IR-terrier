	<brief_summary>60 woman Colposcopy Clinic Royal London Hospital recruit , refer follow abnormal cervical screening result . Aim Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) common cause cervical cancer woman . There interest HPV test place smear test currently use cervical screening . HPV test potential woman take self-samples . These self-samples mostly place liquid preserve test . Using liquid however , make difficult collect sample home due spillage logistics post . Investigators plan investigate whether dry sample reliable . Investigators would also like know sample still use test immediately , particularly warm temperature . This would prove useful country find difficult set national cervical screening programme . Trial Design Investigators ask woman take three vaginal self-samples patient ' colposcopy examination . The sample two swabs third use HerSwab device , design make take sample easy . Investigators give woman instruction sheet illustration . Samples , take random order sample equal chance , send laboratory test different condition . Samples either frozen immediately , store 25ºC one week two week frozen . All sample undergo HPV test . Investigators wish see condition swab provide similar amount HPV . Enrolment plan start May 2015 . Sample process test continue enrolment complete month . Smear biopsy result collect 6 month see affect quantity HPV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Cervical cancer cause persistent infection high risk human papillomavirus type ( Hr-HPV ) prevent detect early stage . Prevention routine cervical screening traditionally do liquid-based cytology sample cell collect clinician examine identify abnormal feature . Another method HPV test perform liquid-based sample cytology . HPV DNA test sensitive , less specific , cytology cervical screening test broadly acceptable woman ( Forrest , McCaffery et al . 2004 ; Waller , McCaffery et al . 2006 ; Szarewski , Cadman et al . 2009 ) . Although clinician-taken sample gold standard , self-sampling may useful alternative . HPV DNA test use self-collected ( SC ) sample show acceptable sensitivity specificity HPV testing compare sample take clinician ( Petignat , Faltin et al . 2007 ; Szarewski , Cadman et al . 2007 ; Arbyn , Verdoodt et al . 2014 ) . A high level concordance self clinician sample HPV DNA detection 0.87 ( 95 % Confidence Intervals ( CI ) , 0.82-0.91 ) show Petignat 's systematic review meta-analysis ( Petignat , Faltin et al . 2007 ) . HPV DNA test well establish new HPV test technology available emerge . HPV DNA test commonly perform cervical sample collect liquid medium ( generally Specimen Transport Medium ( STM ) PreservCyt ) . However , ideal home SC sample often restriction postage biological sample liquid , risk ( although low ) pertain transport medium issue around refrigeration liquid . The removal necessity liquid transport medium ( especially subsequent refrigeration ) would greatly improve accessibility SC sampling reduce cost . This would also increase potential cervical screen area may logistical difficulty lack regular , frequent postal collection refrigerate storage facility . There several study investigate dry sample collection HPV DNA detection ( Shah , Daniel et al . 2001 ; Krech , Castriciano et al . 2009 ; Feng , Cherne et al . 2010 ; Cerigo , Coutlee et al . 2012 ; Darlin , Borgfeldt et al . 2013 ; Eperon , Vassilakos et al . 2013 ) . However , differ methodology requirement refrigeration restrict generalisability result . They also address question long sample dry collection device would remain viable , especially high temperature . Rationale Risks/Benefits Evidence increasingly suggest , least temperate climate , HPV DNA test SC sample use dry swab provide similar sensitivity wet swab ( SC sample place liquid specimen transport medium ) ( Wolfrum , Koutsky et al . 2012 ) . Dry transport could make HPV DNA test SC sample accessible widely available . In UK example , postal packaging simplify liquid involve . HPV primary screening explore clinical trial even introduce screen programme . In Netherlands example SC HPV DNA test within primary screen programme plan introduction non-attenders 2016 ( Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu 2014 ) . The rationale stability study ascertain whether SC sample keep dry condition still useful left period time warm condition . This would particular use many low middle income country cervical cancer incidence mortality high . These country frequently find difficult set national cervical screening programme due lack infrastructure , access efficient refrigeration postal service . Bart 's Health National Health Service ( NHS ) Trust serve diverse population range socio-economic ethnic background inner London . The colposcopy clinic ( Bart 's Hospital relocate Royal London Hospital spring 2015 ) approximately 1050 new woman attend 1900 woman attend follow-up per year . The participation project implication ongoing care woman agree participate . In previous study United Kingdom ( UK ) base screen programme UK , Chlamydia trachomatis , use swabs woman show achievable safe . Histology cytology result within three month prior visit six month post-visit collect . There may difference result depend grade disease confirm excluded information . Trial design This study small preparatory project aim enrol 60 woman colposcopy service compare SC sample take two dry flock swabs CE mark device HerSwabTM ( Eve Medical , Toronto , Canada ) . Each woman take three sample . The swab refrigerate immediately either frozen immediately -20ºC ( SR0 ) preserve sample incubate 25ºC either one ( SA1 ) two week ( SA2 ) . HerSwab sample include incubation part study ( HA1 HA2 ) . The order sample randomise remove bias associate test order roughly equal number first , second third swab allocate swab management regimen . The study precede inform multi-phase study overall aim compare SC HPV test use different device , different condition use different HPV testing assay . Feasibility In period 1st January 2013 31st December 2013 , 1052 new patient attend Bart 's colposcopy unit . In time period 1930 attend follow colposcopy treatment , This would mean 12 month period 2982 woman attend colposcopy . There therefore sufficient number woman potentially recruit study . The service still receive referral relocate Royal London Hospital . Randomisation Procedures Randomisations carry use in-house computer application . The Centre Cancer Prevention generate randomise list link participant number ( PNOs ) pack number code identify order sampling . The order randomise 1:1:1 dry flock swab ( freeze arrival laboratory ) ( SR0 ) , dry flock swab ( incubation 25ºC one ( SA1 ) two week ( SA2 ) arrival laboratory ) , HerSwab ( incubation 25ºC one ( HA1 ) two week ( HA2 ) arrival laboratory ) ( please refer Study Scheme Diagram ) . PNOs assign numbered pack contain three self-sample kit , label show order sample take . 60 woman consent take part give next pack sequential order far possible attend clinic consent study . All sample immediately refrigerate 2-8ºC clinic transfer laboratory . Schedule intervention visit Assessment Visit 1 Three self-samples take x Study device Women ask self-collect three vaginal sample use two dry flock swabs CE mark device HerSwabTM ( Eve Medical , Toronto , Canada ) . HerSwab utilise flock swab contain within plastic applicator , intention make self-sampling easy woman . Procedure Collecting Data Cervical vaginal cytology histology data collect referral cytology result , lead attend colposcopy service , six month post appointment date . All study data entry management undertaken Centre Cancer Prevention . All HPV , cytology histology result enter onto , import , study 's ORACLE database Centre Cancer Prevention ( CCP ) study team . All database protect accessible name staff . Consent form securely store CCP . Laboratory Assessments Extraction detection Human DNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) assay sample . Extraction detection HPV DNA ( primarily HPV 16 ) qPCR assay sample . Validated HPV test sample yield CT RLU value . End Study Definition The end study would define final histology cytology data collect last participant recruit . This would approximately eight month date visit last recruit . Eight month would allow time data enter onto hospital database .</detailed_description>
