	<brief_summary>This multi-centre , single visit clinical investigation involve patient know PCD vs. age match healthy volunteer . This study involve 1 visit last one ( 1 ) two ( 2 ) hour . Participants ( parent applicable ) ask consent participate study . A brief medical history record , include information age , gender , height , weight , race , current medication live environment . If participant PCD patient , also ask disease history . Prior perform nasal measurement , participant receive instruction study personnel opportunity practice . All participant brief nasal exam also blow nose start measurement . Participants ask perform nasal nitric oxide measurement use tidal breathing method follow velum close expiration resistance method . The primary objective determine feasibility capability NIOX VERO discriminate participant PCD healthy . Information collect study help researcher understand diagnosis identification patient PCD .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Male female patient 5 year old . 2 . Anatomically , able complete nasal NO measurement nostrils . 3 . Cohort 1 PCD Patients : Patients must confirm diagnosis PCD one PCD diagnostic centre base clinical phenotype PLUS diagnosis make least 1 follow ( specific diagnosis make must document medical file ) : A nasal biopsy scrap show hallmark PCD defect , outer ( +/ inner ) dynein arm defect , microtubule defect , A genetic test positive bialleilic mutation know PCDcausing gene associate diagnosis PCD ( e.g. , ARMC4 , C21orf59 , CCDC39 , CCDC40 , CCDC65 , CCDC164 , CCDC103 , CCDC114 , CCDC151 , CCNO , DNAAF1 ( LRRC50 ) , DNAAF2 ( KTU ) , DNAAF3 , DNAH5 , DNAH11 , DNAI1 , DNAI2 , DNAL1 , DYX1C1 , HEATR2 , HYDIN , LRRC6 , MCIDAS , NME8 ( TXNDC3 ) , ODA/IDA , OFD1 , RPGR , RSPH3 , RSPH4A , RSPH9 , SPAG1 , ZMYND10 ) , EU Centres Only : A low nasal NO ( determine chemiluminescent analyser ) plus either : least 2 separate occasion 'hallmark ' change highspeed video microscopy , demonstration mislocalisation ciliary protein immunofluorescence microscopy . 4 . Cohort 2 Healthy Patients : Healthy , nonatopic , nonsmoking patient ( defined patient airway immune problem , recent significant injury , systemic infection , systemic inflammation , allergy asthma ) . 1 . Currently smoke less 6 month quit . 2 . Has nose bleed within past 2 week . 3 . Has acute respiratory symptom sign upper low respiratory tract infection . 4 . Use nasal medication describe : Xolair ≤180 day prior nNO measurement Oral Systemic Corticosteroids ≤30 day prior nNO measurement Inhaled , nebulized , intranasal corticosteroid ≤30 day prior nNO measurement Nasal oral decongestant antihistamine ≤14 day prior nNO measurement Leukotriene receptor antagonist ≤30 day prior nNO measurement 5 . Has obstruction anatomy prevents nasal measurement perform ( confirm simple visual inspection Investigator ) . 6 . Has Cystic Fibrosis . 7 . Has document primary acquire immunodeficiency . 8 . Is undergoing treatment NOreleasing drug ( nitrate molsidomine ) . 9 . Has food beverage intake ( water ) participate strenuous exercise within 1 hour nasal NO measurement 10 . Is unwilling unable provide consent participate ( self , parent legal guardian ) . 11 . PCD Patients Only : Has mutation RSPH1 since nasal NO may low patient . 12 . PCD Patients Only : Has standard clinical evaluation address potential cause chronic otosino pulmonary disease . 13 . Healthy Patients Only : Atopy presence following : recent significant injury ( i.e. , within 12 week ) , systemic inflammation , airway immune problem , asthma allergy . 14 . In US : Patients may relate member Study Personnel .</criteria>
