	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label study evaluate safety , efficacy pharmacokinetics prophylactic emicizumab treatment patient previously treat episodic prophylactic bypassing agent . Episodic bypass agent patient randomize 2:1 fashion receive emicizumab prophylaxis ( Arm A ) versus prophylaxis ( Arm B ) stratify across Arms A B accord number bleeds experience last 24 week prior study entry ( less [ &lt; ] 9 great equal [ &gt; = ] 9 bleeds ) ; Arm B patient opportunity switch emicizumab prophylaxis 24 week on-study . Prophylactic bypassing agent patient switch emicizumab prophylaxis ( Arm C ) start trial ; enrollment extend 24 week last patient enrol Arms A B approximately 50 patient enrolled Arm C , whichever occur first . Episodic bypass agent patient previously participate Non-Interventional Study BH29768 unable enroll Arms A B prior closure opportunity enroll Arm D 24 week last patient enrol Arms A B approximately 35 patient enrolled Arm D , whichever occur first . Like patient Arms A C , Arm D patient receive emicizumab prophylaxis start trial . All patient continue receive standard care/background treatment usual episodic bypassing agent therapy treat breakthrough bleeds , need .</brief_summary>
