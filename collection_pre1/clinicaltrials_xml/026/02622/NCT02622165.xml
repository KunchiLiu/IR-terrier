	<brief_title>Rewarding Healthy Food Choices : Mobile Serious Game Intervention Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As high intake energy-dense snack common adolescent related overweight , REWARD-project aim develop evaluate intervention focus improve adolescent ' snacking pattern . Since healthy nutrition promote strategy use limited effect , REWARD-project proposes paradigm shift : development innovative framework facilitate healthy food choice adolescent introduce concept reward sensitivity ( RS ) explain food choice use reward-based strategy serious game intervention . 1.1 General aim objective evaluation study The aim study conduct outcome process evaluation REWARD intervention , serious game use reward-based strategy main method trigger healthy snack Flemish adolescent . 1 . To assess serious game reward healthy food choice improve healthy snack intake ( i.e. , measure healthy snack index ) 14- 16-year old Flemish adolescent . 2 . To assess adolescent ' reward sensitivity moderate effect intervention healthy snack index consume snack . 1.2 Methodology 1.2.1 Study design set The design consist pair‐matched control pre‐post design . The intervention conduct three secondary school specific city Flanders ( Belgium ) , three match school similar city ( comparable socio‐economical , population density , size ) select control set . A specific city select start project intervention city secondary school participate intervention study REWARD project . In order examine intervention effect , result adolescent intervention city need compare adolescent play game school similar city , refer control city . 1.2.2 Study population recruitment The study population consist 14- 16- year-old Flemish adolescent . Most adolescent age 3rd 4th grade secondary school . From school , least 12 class least 15 adolescent ( i.e. , mean number student expect per class give mixture general , vocation , technical education class ) need participate evaluation study , result total 1080 adolescent . Taking account possible drop-out 33 % adolescent level , 33 % oversampling apply . Thus , 1620 adolescent ( i.e. , 24 class per school ) recruit participate evaluation study ( sample size calculation describe 2.7 ) . No exclusion criterion apply . The initial contact intervention school take place start study via invitation letter call meeting . As innovative health promotion project use smartphones school context , school principal three secondary school invite together mayor intervention city extensive presentation discussion project . After meeting , principal inform asked participate development phase intervention well outcome process evaluation study . Moreover , school principal teacher per school also involve intervention development . All school match control city ( i.e. , 6 school ) contact mean formal email telephone call , subsequently control school inform visit researcher order convince least three school participate . Following acceptance school participate study , parent receive letter explain purpose study ask passive consent participation child study . This letter bring home adolescent return adolescent parent want participation . In addition , active consent adolescent ask begin study . 1.2.3 Development material / theoretical basis To date , health promotion effort improve dietary behavior youth focus change cognitive determinant environmental factor order improve dietary behavior . However , intervention use limited success change adolescent ' eat pattern anthropometrics . Therefore , one aim REWARD-project develop new approach ( i.e. , reward-based serious game intervention ) train adolescent opt healthy snack choice . Snacks define food product ( beverage ) consume three main meal ( breakfast , lunch , dinner ) , food product consume less 30 minute meal consider part meal . The rationale innovative intervention describe follow . Current eating behavior population often drive hedonic rather homeostatic hunger . Hedonic hunger drive palatability reward value food absence energy need . It identify crucial determinant disruption homeostatic intake regulation often result long-term positive energy balance ( energy input exceed energy expenditure ) . The present 'obesogenic ' environment mostly include fat- sugar-rich food cue low nutritional value . This highly reward food environment might trigger shape eat behavior less automatic way follow principle instrumental classical conditioning . Nevertheless , individual equally sensitive rewarding aspect present food environment . These individual difference reward sensitivity ( RS ) refer one 's ability experience pleasure reward expose appetitive stimulus , include palatable food . High RS link unhealthy food preference eat behavior adult child . Moreover , find adolescent peak reward drive eat behavior regulative control mature slow pace . Therefore , vulnerable development selective reward drive food preference . While research suggest take account adolescent ' individual RS biological psychological predisposition guide eat behavior , little know specific role RS food cue reactivity learn process adopt healthy food preference healthy eat behavior . Both learn personality theory provide valuable insight eat behavior way . However , propose single determine factor , risk overly simplistic . Contemporary learn theory stress role give factor ( i.e . learn process ) understand additional factor , like personality trait , take account . The REWARD-project therefore aim integrate learn theory personality trait , step away traditional main effect model investigate individual characteristic ( i.e. , RS ) interact learn process related eating behavior . Therefore , goal project develop serious game intervention provision reward positive reinforcement main behavioral change technique . However , early research indicate energy balance-related behavior result joint function conscious unconscious process . Dual-system model dual-process model explain health behavior two interconnected mental system , operate accord different principle . On one hand , reflective system utilized include elaboration cognitive effort build beliefs decision . On hand , behavior consequence impulsive/automatic system certain stimuli cue link certain behavior base earlier learned association . Based previous research theoretical evidence , decide incorporate also behavioral change strategies/methods influence cognitive/reflective pathway addition reward-strategies . The central idea REWARD game -clear start- participant earn credit base nutrition value snack consume ( see follow chapter detail ) . The Intervention Mapping protocol use put idea practice identify additional important ( cognitive ) behavioral change strategy . The intervention develop accord stepwise iterative principle Intervention Mapping Protocol include intensive participatory approach several significant stakeholder throughout phase intervention development . The Intervention Mapping protocol start extensive problem analysis use exist newly generate evidence . Preliminary study inform intervention development organize REWARD-project 1 ) large-scale cross-sectional study , 2 ) large-scale focus group research , 3 ) experimental research investigate non-food reward schema compete reward character palatable food adolescent . A large-scale cross-sectional study investigate dietary game behavior individual environmental determinant among 1100 Flemish adolescent first implement . Subsequently , focus group research conduct among 100 adolescent investigate nutrition-related result cross-sectional study depth . Next , focus group conduct pool adolescent brainstorm conceptual model serious game ( i.e. , preferred game dynamic , game use , game motivation ) . Based extensive literature review well result preliminary REWARD study , follow correlates/determinants individual level find associated intake snack : knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy , taste preference . More knowledge healthiness snack associate high intake healthy snack . A positive attitude towards healthy unhealthy snack correlate high intake respective snack . A low self-efficacy eat healthy snack associate high intake fat- and/or sugar-rich snack vice versa . Taste preference one strong predictor snack intake , however , difficult change include intervention . The selected determinant ( knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy ) target via five method , namely active learning , advance organizer , goal setting , monitoring ( latter two include feedback ) . - Knowledge nutritional quality food item enhance via credit system use reward player healthy choice . This credit system include continuum range 0 ( i.e. , unhealthy snack item ) 50 ( i.e. , healthy food item ) . In game , refer prefer non-preferred snack instead healthy unhealthy snack , respectively . By provision credit game game advancement link credit , participant learn location specific snack healthy-unhealthy continuum . The method select change practical knowledge base Elaboration Likelihood Model , namely active learn advance organizer . The Elaboration Likelihood Model suggest people process information centrally ( i.e. , careful consideration increase knowledge ) motivate , information personally relevant , repeat . The credit system use game see external motivator change snack behaviour , however , insight ( un ) healthiness snack item base credit system stimulate central process information knowledge specific credit per snack item application knowledge enhance progress game . Moreover , point also personally relevant ( i.e. , link snack consume ) repeatedly present . In addition , healthy-unhealthy continuum range 0-50 placement different snack item continuum base credit , act mental reminder ( i.e. , mental axis ) regard nutritional value snack item . Furthermore , similar application two method nutritional quality , gratuity use serious game relate limitation snack intake ( ≤ six snack per day ) preference healthy snack ( ≥2/3 healthy snack per day ) learn adolescent well-balanced snack pattern . This cut-off six snack 2/3 healthy snack base Flemish guideline necessary food nutrient intake . It advise consume maximum 10 % energy snack ( define unhealthy snack ) . Fourteen 16- year old girl boys general advise total energy intake per day 2100 2600 kcal , respectively . So correspond maximum intake 210-250 kcal unhealthy snack ( i.e. , one two unhealthy snack per day depend size nutritional content ) . Additionally , advise adolescent eat three piece fruit four dairy product per day ( i.e. , via snack also via meal ) . The cut-off maximum six snack 2/3 healthy snack per day deduce guideline , intake three four healthy snack together one two unhealthy snack acceptable adolescent need lot energy grow . - Positive attitude regard healthy snack activate via method mere exposure . Earlier research indicate participant positive attitude stimulus time expose ( i.e. , intervention expect increase exposure healthy snack participant receive credit ) , even consciously aware process . Moreover , association positive reinforcement healthy snack also result positive attitude , previous research state attitude automatically activate : exposure stimuli positive evaluation activates positive attitude . - Self-efficacy targeted via goal set monitoring . Goal set high likelihood improve health behavior persons goal exert great extent , persevere aim , concentrate , develop strategy able perform necessary behavior . In addition , early research indicate self-monitoring successful behavioral change technique energy balance-related intervention research . During three week intervention , participant need choose one four -personal , feasible measurable- snacking goal ( week 3 till week 5 : every week one specific goal choose goal reach daily ) . The chosen goal evaluate per day credits/rewards provide case success . At end every game week , feedback provide via in-game week-report portrays consume snack per weekday match credit . This week-report also provide feedback fail success regard goal . By provide weekly self-monitoring tool regard snack intake , insight awareness snack behavior . This week-report create elaboration snack behavior . In case success ( i.e. , link goal ) , increase self-efficacy/capability eat healthy snack . In case failure , feedback pending reward stimulate elaboration another try possible increase self-efficacy success future . Additionally , influence peer parent also indicate important . Peer ' modeling , social support , social pressure well physical social home environment associate snack intake adolescent . However , possible target environment choose -individual- serious game channel . Nevertheless , indirect positive effect intervention peer ' model social support pressure expect give chosen game motivation dynamics serious game , corporation competition ( see ) . The result Uses Gratifications Questionnaire measure REWARD cross-sectional study , indicate challenge ( i.e. , push high level skill personal accomplishment ) important motivation play game adolescent . Additionally , competition ( i.e . prove best skill react think fast ) social interaction ( i.e . play together online offline ) also show important motivation engage game play . Furthermore , REWARD cross-sectional study examine game dynamic structural characteristic game indicate important aspect game adolescent use list game dynamic . These game dynamic refer inherent feature game facilitate initiation game play maintenance game play time . The result show adolescent regard follow dynamic crucial important characteristic game : ( 1 ) competitive aspect / play people / leaderboard ranking , ( 2 ) cooperation / work together reach goal , ( 3 ) different story outcome base player action , ( 4 ) 'Levelling ' game character , ( 5 ) earn point reward . Previous research also highlight importance challenge , competition , interaction game motivation cooperation , reward , game motivation / dynamic . Previous study indicate importance story line increase immersion intrinsic motivation play game . Moreover , inclusion three psychological need base Self-Determination Theory , namely autonomy , competence , relatedness , link increase intrinsic motivation play game . From viewpoint , important participant make choice game lead different ending ( i.e. , autonomy ) , customize avatar accord preference ( i.e. , autonomy relatedness ) , experience different difficulty level base performance indicator achievement good satisfies player ' need competence . The next chapter provide detail application abovementioned method game motivation dynamic REWARD serious game . 1.2.4 Study duration intervention components The study period consist pretest , four-week 'The Snack Track High School '' serious game intervention , post-test immediately end intervention . The intervention group receive four-week serious game intervention , extra component add intervention school . The control school continue usual school curriculum . Smartphones ( Lumia 435 ) provide adolescent without smartphone adolescent intervention school participate . As mention , health promotion intervention limited effect . Therefore , new innovative approach choose REWARD-project well innovative intervention channel , i.e. , mobile serious game . Several reason could provide channel high likelihood success . First , play game popular pastime among adolescent , early study find adolescent spend average 18 hour month play game . Second , game intrinsically motivate adolescent higher engagement intervention achieve . Third , video game interactive , lead satisfaction . Finally , game allow practice desire behavior safe environment . 1.2.5 Implementation evaluation intervention The serious game launch Monday February 2016 researcher . Weekly process evaluation moment provide inside participation adolescent game also use moment encourage participation , do teacher researcher depend preference school . During study period , possible contact researcher phone email . If necessary , visit researcher possible . In addition , help function build game participant always contact researcher game developer case technical problem . The outcome evaluation study include pre-post measurement . These measurement consist anthropometrical measurement well adolescent questionnaire measure primary outcome ( healthy snack index ; BMI ) , secondary outcome ( personal peer ' variable ) , control variable . 1.2.6 Sample size calculation The sample size calculate healthy snack index ( i.e. , primary outcome intervention study ) . The ICC 's , mean standard deviation regard healthy eat index base earlier cross-sectional Reward study test-retest REWARD FFQ measure snack intake . Assuming ICC 0.02 school level ICC 0.03 class level mean standard deviation Healthy Snacking Index 37.8±20.2 , need involve least 12 class 15 adolescent per school ( 3 intervention school 3 control school ) obtain power 80 % detect difference 20 % intervention control 5 % significance level . To account possible loss follow-up , oversampling 33 % apply . A total sample 1620 adolescent ( control intervention ) recruit . 1.2.7 Data handling After every data collection wave , adolescent questionnaire scan use scan software package TELEForm ( version 6.1 , Cardiff Software Inc. , San Marcos , California , USA ) . Afterwards data translate SPSS file . The school management questionnaire , teacher post-questionnaire , weekly log , anthropometrical measure enter manually research assistant data collection . 1.2.8 Statistics Descriptive analysis use individual level compare intervention control group baseline . Repeated measure analyse take account cluster ( child-class-school ) use evaluate difference primary outcome variable healthy snack index anthropometrics . In addition , subgroup analysis , mediate moderating analysis conduct provide insight intervention effect .</detailed_description>
