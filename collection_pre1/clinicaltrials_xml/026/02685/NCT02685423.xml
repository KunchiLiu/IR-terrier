	<brief_summary>Amblyopia impairment spatial vision cause asymmetry quality visual input across two eye childhood . It difficult treat adulthood visual system become less `` plastic '' ( able learn ) age . The purpose study determine whether five ten day visual deprivation -- live complete darkness -- enhance plasticity visual cortex thereby facilitate learning need recover visual function amblyopic adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An asymmetry visual input across eye early postnatal life cause amblyopia , common basis uni-ocular blindness human . If uncorrected , amblyopia result unaffected eye control binocular visual cortex , ability affect eye stimulate cortical neuron may weaken point functional blindness . Previous attempt recover vision adult amblyopes limit success , investigator propose due large part significant reduction synaptic plasticity occur cortical development . The investigator propose optimal recovery amblyopia adulthood two stage process require 1 ) reactivation plasticity adult amblyopic cortex ( permissive step ) 2 ) focus visual experience stimulate perceptual learning ( instructive step ) . The Elizabeth Quinlan lab University Maryland recently show binocular visual deprivation adulthood enhances synaptic plasticity adult cortex experimental animal little three day . In addition , binocular visual deprivation prior repetitive visual experience stimulate recovery spatial acuity animal model deep amblyopia . Here investigator propose translate finding treatment amblyopia human . The investigator propose use binocular visual deprivation promote synaptic plasticity amblyopic visual cortex , follow visual perceptual learning vision therapy homework , stimulate recovery visual function . While visual perceptual learning previously show enhance visual function amblyopic adult , gain slow modest . The investigator predict `` pre-treatment '' amblyopic visual system binocular visual deprivation enhance magnitude and/or time course learning-induced recovery amblyopia . Twenty-four adult amblyopes , age 18 old , recruit study . The investigator exclude amblyopes strabismus history treatment design improve binocular alignment ( motor fusion ) . Thus , amblyopes form deprivation amblyopes , especially form deprivation due anisometropia , moderate ( 20/30 20/80 ) severe ( 20/100 20/400 ) acuity affect eye . Screening include extensive application , telephone interview two personal reference , comprehensive visual examination , in-person interview . Participants fit new ophthalmics indicate follow several week allow amblyopia stabilize . Their visual function assess behaviorally also direct measurement neural activity use visually evoke potential ( VEPs ) . Participants assign one three group . One group sequester zero day , one five continuous day , one ten continuous day . Participants five ten day sequestration group undergo sequestration group two , three , four . After sequestration visual function assess , behaviorally VEP . All participant undergo 8 week ( 3 week , 5 week ) vision treatment amblyopia , base video game play . Vision test occur regularly period 10 month thereafter . A third VEP scan do end 8 week treatment period . If successful , work would transform therapy adult amblyopia , focus attention importance incorporate method enhance synaptic plasticity adjunct treatment . In addition , insight gain work could extend strabismus , eye movement control disorder , restoration optimal neural function damage stroke traumatic brain injury . The propose experiment also pioneer use binocular visual deprivation human amblyopes , develop standard implementation , participant sequestration care .</detailed_description>
