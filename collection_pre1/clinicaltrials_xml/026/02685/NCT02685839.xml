	<brief_summary>Elderly care become one important subject Taiwan `` frailty syndrome '' common problem among elderly . In view trend , Taipei Veteran Memorial Hospital import POWER rehabilitation Japan 2008 . While show significant clinical benefit , investigator find system still certain limitation ( e.g . high cost , require large space , patient must commute center , lack real-time objective feedback , bore routine make stay power motivate patient long term rehabilitation program . ) To overcome limitation , project propose evidence-based rehabilitation model account actual clinical need collaborates engineering team develop `` cluster '' , `` wearable '' `` Brain-Computer Interface System '' version POWER rehabilitation system . Combining cloud technology , investigator introduce internet-of-things POWER rehabilitation procedure . The result low burden clinical support personnel , provide opportunity quantify `` frailty syndrome '' allow objective quantitative scientific evaluation , lead objective clinical diagnosis . In addition , project propose virtual-reality ( VR ) system POWER rehabilitation , well design VR scenery . Through use different animate 3D VR scenery interactive game design , investigator make rehabilitation interesting fun patient , motivate long-term compliance patient , thereby , improve clinical outcome POWER rehabilitation . This project potential create innovative solution address current bottleneck rehabilitation treatment model . Successful development system offer rehabilitation clinician treatment option , low cost support staff , reduce commute cost patient , elevate patient desire comply treatment program . Finally , system enhance Taiwan 's academic reputation international arena , also generate new commercial opportunity Taiwan contribute Taiwan economic development .</brief_summary>
