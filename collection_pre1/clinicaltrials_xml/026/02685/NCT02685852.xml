	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluating Exenatide Treatment Postprandial Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia Post-RYGB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery ( RYGB ) one common bariatric surgery United States generally highly effective weight loss . Unfortunately , among potential complication hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . Though prevalence disorder fully characterize , associate debilitating symptom severely impact quality life life-threatening . The underlie pathophysiology hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia likely involve mismatch amount insulin secrete response mealtime carbohydrate absorption . It observe ingestion high carbohydrate load often lead modest rise post-prandial glucose level follow inappropriately exaggerated insulin release among individual condition . Low carbohydrate diet sometimes provide full partial relief symptom . Standard medical management RYGB associate postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia include acarbose , partially reduce carbohydrate absorption gut , diazoxide , directly inhibit insulin release pancreatic beta cell . However , medical option reliably effective , leading individual reverse RYGB , also may effective , even undergo partial pancreatectomy , risk additional complication diabetes . Much reliably effective treatment need special population develop bariatric surgical complication . Potential mechanism contribute mismatch insulin secretion post RYGB include decreased systemic adipose tissue inflammation , increase insulin receptor expression liver skeletal muscle , increase adiponectin .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. must undergo RYGB subsequently develop postprandial hypoglycemia ( define least 3 episode sixmonth period document capillary blood sugar [ &lt; 60 mg/dL hypoglycemic symptom ) . Subjects may also formal mixed meal tolerance test post meal blood sugar &lt; 60 mg/dL . 2 . Subjects otherwise meet study criterion hypoglycemia symptom document hypoglycemia plasma measurement may undergo screen visit document requisite level consideration study . 1 . Chronic acute diseases liver . 2 . Chronic acute disease pancreas ( include type 1 diabetes pancreatitis history pancreatitis ) . Subjects may diagnosis type 2 diabetes must longer require diabetes medication . 3 . Chronic acute diseases kidney . 4 . Known malignancy must family history medullary thyroid cancer . 5 . History preRYGB hypoglycemia symptom low document plasma glucose preoperatively . 6 . Pregnant plan become pregnant throughout study duration 7 . Breastfeeding 8 . Medication exclusion addition current use diabetes medication . Subjects exclude previously take GLP1 agonist .</criteria>
