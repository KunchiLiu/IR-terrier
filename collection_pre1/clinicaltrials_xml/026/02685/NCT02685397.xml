	<brief_title>Management Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer With Oligometastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer ( PCa ) common type cancer affect men , unfortunately , majority PCa patient , death attribute metastatic disease . Lifelong androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) LHRH agonists help delay cancer progression metastatic PCa patient . However , patient eventually become castration-resistant ( disease progression despite ADT ) develop progressive metastatic disease . This turn impact patient 's quality life survival . Recently , new generation hormonal therapy ( Enzalutamide ) become available castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) patient . We believe benefit new generation hormonal therapy prolong CRPC patient develop oligometastases treat metastatic lesion use stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) . This new radiation technique allow treatment many different metastasis throughout body precise manner . This metastases-directed therapy new treatment option patient limited number metastasis ( less 5 ) time recurrence . This adaptive phase II/III randomize trial design demonstrate eradication oligometastases new technique SBRT promise emerge way delay disease progression postpone second line systemic therapy . Only patient oligometastatic recurrence local treatment curative intent eligible take part trial . All participate CRPC patient oligometastases receive either standard care ( i.e . LHRH agonist combination new generation hormonal therapy [ Enzalutamide ] ) experimental treatment ( i.e . LHRH agonist combination new generation HT [ Enzalutamide ] plus additional SBRT treatment ) . The patient undergo different evaluation treatment , image confirm oligometastatic recurrence blood test . Patients stratify accord location metastasis ( visceral [ without bone metastasis ] vs. bone metastasis alone ) PSA double time ( ≤ 3 vs. &gt; 3 month ) . As per standard care , patient PSA test perform every 6-12 week re-imaging 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month PSA progression , whichever occur first . The primary objective study evaluate radiographic progression-free survival . We also want determine time start second line systemic therapy , prostate-cancer specific survival , overall survival well assess quality life , toxicity PSA response . This study first randomize study set employ randomize phase II design determine large scale phase III trial need , thus phase II/III design . The Phase II consist 130 CRPC patient oligometastases , phase III consist already randomize 130 patient plus estimated 244 patient total sample size 374 patient . This study conduct Genitourinary Radiation Oncology Group Quebec ( GROUQ ) different radiation oncology centre across Canada recruitment complete within 30 month activation .</detailed_description>
