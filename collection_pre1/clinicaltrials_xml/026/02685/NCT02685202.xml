	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize course temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) pain adult TMD obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , treat mandibular advancement splint ( MAS ) therapy . Study participants 12 adult painful TMD comorbid mild moderate OSA ( apnea-hypopnea index ≥5 &lt; 30 ) . This interventional study 12 patient receive MAS therapy comorbid TMD/OSA 16 week . It standard care treat mild moderate OSA MAS therapy , effect MAS therapy TMD pain people OSA unknown . There comparison group . Care provided direction sleep physician dentist specialize dental sleep medicine . The investigator expect MAS therapy reduces severity OSA , painful TMD symptom also reduce .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temporomandibular Disorder ( TMD ) Pain Response Jaw Advancement People With TMD Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two chronic health condition treat oral appliance sleep . One condition temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) ; musculoskeletal disorder characterize pain masseter muscle temporomandibular joint . TMD pain treat stabilization splint operate limit abnormal muscle activity . The condition obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Mild moderate OSA treat mandibular advancement splint ( MAS ) hold mandible protruded position increase pharyngeal airway space reduce upper airway collapsibility . The comorbidity two condition high . Approximately one four patient clinically diagnose TMD OSA diagnose polysomnogram ( PSG ) . This comorbidity pose problem management neither appliance consider effective treating condition . In fact , mandible advancement assume worsen TMD pain . However assumption well support scientific evidence , study find mandibular advancement actually reduce TMD pain , albeit transient increase TMD pain patient . Furthermore , anecdotal evidence suggest mandibular advancement reduces TMD pain . It believe maintain open airway oral appliance , patient longer clench teeth effort prevent airway collapse sleep . The overall objective study characterize temporal nature TMD pain adult comorbid TMD/OSA treat MAS therapy . It first study monitor adherence MAS therapy objectively study population , use microsensor embed MAS . Recruitment MAS therapy conduct Lane Associates Family Dentistry ; group 27 dental practice locate throughout Triangle Triad region North Carolina . Advantages use Lane &amp; Associates : large influx new dental patient every month , fast recruitment , well-established protocol screen TMD OSA referral patient sleep physician evaluation PSG , standardize protocols oral appliance therapy , Dental Sleep Medicine director highly experience also management TMD . The study coordinator dental hygienist University North Carolina ( UNC ) School Dentistry Dental Sleep Clinic work School 's Dental Sleep Medicine practice . She travel Lane &amp; Associates office assist clinical administrative activity manage data collection 12 subject . The Dental Sleep Clinic UNC School Dentistry consider adequate serve study site currently operate one day week accepts referrals patient without TMD pain . In pre-enrollment phase , patient Lane Associates Family Dentistry complete standard TMD screening questionnaire . Those screen positive clinically examine Research Diagnostic Criteria TMD confirm Group II : Masticatory Muscle Disorders , 1A : Myalgia . They also screen OSA use validated STOP-BANG questionnaire . Those high risk refer evaluation sleep physician diagnostic PSG , standard care Lane Associates . If PSG reveal mild moderate OSA ( apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) ≥5 &lt; 30 ) , patient candidate oral appliance therapy , pending confirmation sleep physician , thus eligible enroll study . Subjects consent assessed demographic , medical history , medication use . Impressions upper low dental arch record , pour dental stone send lab . A George Gauge record protrusive bite registration jaw advance 60 % retruded position . The custom-made MAS fit micro-recorder ( Braebon DentiTrac Monitor ) ass adherence . The investigator define adherence use splint 4 hours/night ≥70 % night standard practice continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy . Home sleep test ( HST ) : Subjects complete series ( 2 5 ) two-night home sleep test ( HSTs ) use portable AccuSom device NovaSom , collect sleep parameter AHI , minimum oxygen saturation , snore index . Novosom arrange shipment device offer 24-hour technical support sleep test . Sleep data upload wirelessly recorder online portal statistical analysis . Following baseline home sleep test ( HST ) , 12 participant enter study wear MAS sleep protrudes mandible 60 % maximal advancement . This approximate minimum amount jaw advancement expect efficacious . A HST repeat end Week # 4 . If HST show MAS efficacious ( i.e . reduce baseline apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) ≥50 % AHI ≥10** ) , TMD pain worse , mandible advance 70 % participant repeat HST end Week # 8 . Once efficacy achieve , need HSTs . If efficacy achieve end Week # 8 TMD pain worse , mandible advance 75 % participant repeat HST end Week # 12 . If efficacy yet achieve TMD pain worse , mandibular advance 80 % participant undergo final HST end Week # 16 . Once HST indicate MAS efficacious reduce AHI , participant maintain level advancement . The minimum number HSTs one participant 2 ( baseline 4-week follow-up ) maximum number 5 .</detailed_description>
