	<brief_title>Decitabine Combined With Gemcitabine First-line Treatment AdvancedPancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study intend advanced pancreatic cancer row standard district group random way divide two group , group gemcitabine monotherapy treatment group , another group gemcitabine combine low dose decitabine treatment group . The overall survival , progression free survival , disease control rate observe patient treat combined therapy . At time , safety tolerance observe . The methylation status influence immune function also detect biological test .</detailed_description>
