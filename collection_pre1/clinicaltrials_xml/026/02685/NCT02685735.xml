	<brief_summary>The objective research study well understand pattern recovery Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) . The study evaluate pain , activity cognitive ( i.e. , think style ) responses determine pattern recovery , study evaluate efficacy gabapentin versus placebo improve recovery surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting , Understanding Speeding Recovery After TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose two-site , longitudinal , double-blind , randomized clinical intervention study examine three specific aim : Aim 1 : Characterize dynamic pain experience , activity , cognitive response TKA determine pattern recovery domains Aim 2 : Test whether gabapentin alters time course recovery TKA manner dependent interaction pre-drug pupil diameter preferred style catastrophizing-optimism dimension Aim 3 : Test whether gabapentin increase pupil diameter patient undergo TKA high dose opioids preoperatively examine whether opioid use moderate association Aim 1 Primary Hypothesis : Novel variance beyond establish association recovery pain follow TKA surgery account interaction pupil diameter Cognitive-Affective ( C-A ) state , interaction predicts efficacy gabapentin speed recovery . Key secondary hypothesis : Disability , impulsivity , attentional deficit recover TKA surgery follow log time pattern , predict C-A state interaction pupil diameter . Gabapentin increase rest pupil diameter patient schedule TKA receive high dos opioids .</detailed_description>
