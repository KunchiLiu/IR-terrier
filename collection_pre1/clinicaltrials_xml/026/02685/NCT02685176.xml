	<brief_summary>This Clinical trial conduct study effectiveness heat donation head torso hypothermic rewarming efficacy use human model severe hypothermia . The purpose study compare core rewarming effectiveness amount heat donation head torso treatment hypothermia use human model severe hypothermia . The information obtain study give good understand heat-transfer mechanism . This might help ongoing research hypothermia treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Head Torso Rewarming Using Human Model Severe Hypothermia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedure : Eight healthy , non-pregnant participant 18 45 year old cool 8°C water , 60 minute core temperature 35ºC three occasion warm three warm condition . The study include follow specific procedure : Anthropometric data include age , weight , height , measurement skinfold thickness four sites- biceps , triceps , subscapularis , suprailiac collect . Participant 's heart rate electrocardiogram monitor continuously throughout experiment . Conditions : The three treatment method follow . A. Spontaneous rewarming ( Shivering inhibition ) In control condition , Demerol infuse arm hand vein . The first 1.5 mg/kg slowly injected five equal dos ( 0.3 mg/kg ) 2 minute interval last 10 minute cold water immersion . After removal water , aliquots 0.3 mg/kg ( minimum 2-minute interval ) give necessary inhibit shivering may develop , maximum cumulative dose 3.2 mg/kg body weight . After towel dry subject lie mattress insulate cover without extra heating modality . Spontaneous rewarming first condition every subject , result use determine dosage schedule demerol active warming condition . B . Head warm : Charcoal Heater apply Head ( CH-H ) - A charcoal heater ( HEATPAC Personal Heater , Emergco Tech . Solutions , Vancouver ) consist combustion chamber , canister contain charcoal fuel , branch heat duct produce 250 W heat . The canister place inside combustion chamber charcoal fuel ignite . Heated air blow impermeable heating duct fan within charcoal heater combustion chamber . The combustion chamber place right side face/head ducts wrap around dorsum head , anteriorly forehead , nose , chin neck , cover eye mouth . The participant breathing ambient air ( ̴ 22˚C ) . C. Torso warming : Charcoal Heater Torso ( CH-T ) - The charcoal heater use . The combustion chamber place subject 's anterior chest towel . The flexible duct apply area high heat transfer i.e . shoulder , neck , anteriorly axillae cross lower anterior chest . Participant breathe ambient air room temperature ( ~22˚C ) . Rewarming procedure administer either period 60 minute core temperature return normal value ( ̴ 36.5-37˚C ) . Following , participant place warm water bath ( 40-42˚C ) wish exit core temperature reach 37°C . Research Design : Each three experimental trial separate least 48 hour . On three trial , participant immerse level sternal notch 8˚C 60 minute core temperature fall 35˚C . Demerol administer licensed physician final 10 minute immersion suppress shiver . Participants exit water , dry rewarmed either head torso warm technique . After removal water , extra dosage demerol might give suppress shiver necessary . The rewarming administer 120 minute core temperature return normal value ( ̴36.5-37˚C ) . The order warm method follow modify balanced design control first two active warm condition balance .</detailed_description>
