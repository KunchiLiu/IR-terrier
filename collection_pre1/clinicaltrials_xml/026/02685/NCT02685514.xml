	<brief_title>A Evaluation High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) Treatment Relapsed Graves ' Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Grave 's disease common cause hyperthyroidism affect approximately 2 % woman 0.2 % men population . The use antithyroid drug ( ATD ) first-line treatment Graves ' disease many center decade , use increase worldwide . One reason may induce remission , whereas radioiodine ( RAI ) surgery often lead hypothyroidism complication addition hospitalization radiation exposure . However , ATD use also associate increase risk adverse minor effect skin rash , gastric intolerance , arthralgia 5 % patient . Furthermore , major adverse event , agranulocytosis hepatotoxicity may life-threatening rare ( &lt; 0.5 % case ) . These usually occur first three six month treatment , tend associate high ATD dos . Therefore , recommend duration ATD treatment generally longer 12-24 month . However , despite adequate medical treatment , 50-70 % patient Graves ' disease would relapse recur therefore , definitive approach use RAI treatment thyroid surgery eventually need resolution hyperthyroidism . Although RAI consider safe easy manage , particularly patient without Grave 's ophthalmopathy ( GO ) , subclinical overt hypothyroidism may occur month even year administration RAI . Hence , long-term follow-up thyroid function GO well management thyroxine replacement necessary . Similarly , although surgery main therapeutic strategy , carry 2 % -10 % risk complication hypocalcemia , transient permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy , bleeding , postoperative infection . In view , various nonsurgical , minimally invasive treatment alternative develop specialized treatment center . High-intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) noninvasive procedure involve application focus high-energy ultrasound beam thermal tissue ablation inside target zone , minimal effect surround tissue . This method apply treatment variety medical condition uterine fibroid prostate , breast , pancreatic , liver tumor . A favorable outcome also observe patient primary secondary hyperparathyroidism . HIFU also propose thyroid nodule ablation . In human feasibility study , 25 patient treat 2 week schedule thyroidectomy . Pathologic analysis demonstrate targeted tissue destruction 2 % -80 % without damage neighbor structure . To investigator knowledge , study follow-up HIFU ablation Graves ' disease publish , except one report two patient receive combination microwave ablation RAI . Thus , purpose prospective study ass short-term efficacy safety US-guided HIFU ablation treatment relapse Graves ' disease .</detailed_description>
