	<brief_summary>Isolation contagious patient expensive , require caregiver time , patient perceive isolation mental strain show level care observation lower normal ward . But isolation contagious patient necessary protect patient , hospital staff relatives prevent spread infection , bad case out-break . There different isolation regime available depend causative agent mode transmission . A community-acquired acute gastroenteritis ( GE ) often cause Norovirus hospital-acquired acute GE often cause toxin produce Clostridium difficile . Patients infected Norovirus Clostridium difficile isolate single room strict contact precaution . Patients infect acute GE cause pathogen isolated multi-bed room private toilet . However , time arrival hospital know patient contagious . The indication isolation make base clinical evaluation risk isolate many patient . Aim study : To identify anamnestic , clinical paraclinical variable use indicator aetiology infectious GE , thus give indication isolation . To clinically evaluate combine RNA ( Norovirus ) DNA ( Clostridium difficile ) fast PCR analysis test identify infectious GE compare gold standard method .</brief_summary>
