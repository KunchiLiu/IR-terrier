	<brief_summary>This prospective randomize phase II clinical trial patient receive enzalutamide pre-chemotherapy space randomize upon objective progression ( radiographic and/or clinical per PCWG2 criterion ) docetaxel/prednisone alone combination plus enzalutamide . The primary aim evaluate whether continue enzalutamide combination docetaxel patient fail progressed enzalutamide would increase progression-free survival ( PFS ) 4 month . The secondary end point PSA response , percent patient alive 1 2 year , decline circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) , quality life ( QOL ) use validated scale .</brief_summary>
