	<detailed_description>This phase 3 , randomize , open-label , active control , multicenter study evaluate maintenance response , safety patient report outcomes ( PROs ) acromegaly patient treat octreotide capsule patient treat SOC parenteral SRLs , previously tolerate demonstrated biochemical control treatment . The core study consist three phase : Screening phase , Run-in phase Randomized Controlled Treatment Phase ( RCT ) . Eligible patient biochemically control parenteral SRLs switch octreotide capsule 26-week Run-in phase . During phase effective dose patient determine dose titration . Patients whose acromegaly control biochemically octreotide capsule end Run-in Phase enter 36-week open-label Randomized Controlled Treatment Phase , randomize continue octreotide capsule switch back injectable SRL treatment ( receive prior Screening ) . Following completion core study ( Screening , Run-in RCT phase ) , eligible patient offer enter Study Extension phase receive octreotide capsule product marketing study termination . A Sub-study , select site , would allow patient in-adequate biochemical control octreotide capsule Run-in Phase enter Combination phase receive co-administration octreotide capsule cabergoline tablet total 36 week .</detailed_description>
