	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Obsessive‐Compulsive Disorder [ OCD ] psychiatric disorder lifetime prevalence 2 % mainly characterize obsessional idea compulsive behaviour ritual . Many patient show improvement cognitive behavioural and/or pharmacological treatment . A minority patient refractory available therapy may benefit capsulotomy1 . From 1999 onwards , Deep Brain Stimulation [ DBS ] propose alternative capsulotomy refractory case OCD ( 2,3 ) . In Belgium , currently reimbursement device DBS OCD , rechargeable neurostimulators , OCD patient . STUDY RATIONALE Some patient DBS OCD need frequent replacement neurostimulators ( Medtronic Synergy 7427 ® [ Synergy ] , Medtronic Kinetra 7428 ® [ Kinetra ] , Medtronic Activa PC 37601 ® [ Activa PC ] ) , due end‐of‐life battery . This result frequent re‐interventions , probably cause discomfort patient , wound problem infection due revision surgery scar tissue , hardware problem increase cost public health system ( consultation , hardware device , surgery complication ) . A new type neurostimulators externally rechargeable battery develop recently . The manufacturer estimate longevity device 9 year . These product conformity essential requirement Directive 1999/5/EC Radio Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive 90/385/EEC Active Implantable Medical Devices . Currently CE mark indication DBS Parkinson 's Disease Essential Tremor , DBS psychiatric disorder OCD . Therefore , till use patient treat DBS OCD . Therefore , physician‐initiated study try investigate whether use new rechargeable neurostimulator effective safe DBS treat OCD patient . HYPOTHESIS The hypothesis present study implantation use rechargeable neurostimulators OCD patient treat DBS ( 1 ) effective , ( 2 ) applicable , ( 3 ) safe ( 4 ) decrease need neurostimulator replacement . OBJECTIVES To prove hypothesis , follow objective aim study : 1 . Efficacy : ‐To test whether DBS use rechargeable neurostimulators effective psychiatric symptom compare DBS use non‐rechargeable neurostimulators patient . 2 . Applicability : ‐To investigate whether specific patient population capable recharge rechargeable neurostimulators properly . 3 . Safety : ‐To document possible side effect DBS OCD use rechargeable neurostimulators . 4 . Capability diminish need neurostimulator replacement : ‐To investigate whether discomfort risk frequent neurostimulator replacement due battery end‐of‐life diminish use rechargeable neurostimulators . STUDY DESIGN At Neurosurgery Psychiatry consultation , eligible patient inform present study . As soon informed consent obtain , next time battery non-rechargeable neurostimulator reach end‐of‐life elective replacement plan , rechargeable neurostimulator ( need ) extension lead adaptor necessary connect neurostimulators exist extension lead implant instead new non‐rechargeable neurostimulator . After informed consent obtain , every consultation implantation rechargeable neurostimulator parameter state primary secondary endpoint ' section record . TRIAL INTERVENTION The main trial intervention study implantation one rechargeable neurostimulator instead currently use non-rechargeable neurostimulator ( ) surgical closure one exist abdominal wall cavity ( so‐called `` pocket '' ) . It may necessary tunnel extension cable one side another within thoracic abdominal wall . Thereby , may provoke extension cable loop may provoke undesirable stimulation pass magnetic field . However risk seem small risk dissect electrode replace extension cable side . This intervention do general local anaesthetic . ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING All adverse event note implantation rechargeable neurostimulator . Below list possible adverse event non‐rechargeable rechargeable neurostimulators DBS OCD : - Early late surgery anaesthesia relate problem - A `` pulling '' experience level implant neurostimulator extension cable - Postoperative pain discomfort - Displacement neurostimulator - Erosion skin superficial implant hardware - Allergic reaction rejection towards implant hardware - Wound infection infection implant hardware - Swelling hematoma region implantation - Pain , itch discomfort incision/implant sit - Death - Hardware directly stimulation‐related problem - Hardware failure ( e.g . breakage isolation damage cable , neurostimulator failure… ) - Unwanted spontaneous reset neurostimulator - Fluctuating result - Early end‐of‐life ( less expect ) battery neurostimulator - Playing patient programmer - Shocking jolt stimulation - Exceeding upper limit current pass DBS system , indicated manufacturer , extreme circumstance might lead biological effect tip electrode comparable capsulotomy - Electromagnetic interference might lead dysfunction DBS system extreme circumstance even death ( e.g . MRI scan ) - Motor movement problem - Teeth grind - Akathisia - Balance disturbance - Coordination problem - Torticollis - Cheek twitch - Other muscle contraction - Increased tic - Fractures - Tremor - Sleeping problem fatigue - Insomnia - Hypersomnia - Increased fatigue - Vivid dream nightmare - Gastro‐intestinal problem - Altered sensation taste/smell - Weight gain weight loss - Nausea vomit - Increased hungriness decrease appetite - Esophagitis - Slow gastric empty - Abdominal pain - Diarrhoea constipation - Anal blood loss - Mouth , ENT respiratory problem - Nose bleed - Dental infection - Dry mouth - Tinnitus - Hump earwax - Respiratory infection - Shortness breath - Sleep apnoea - Sexual urinary problem - Urinary , prostate kidney infection - Libido increase decrease - Erection decrease - Ejaculation problem - Vaginal discharge - Urinary incontinence - Increased urinary frequency - Cardiovascular problem - Palpitations - Arterial hypertension - Episodic retrosternal pain - Neurologic problem - Headaches - A `` flashing '' sensation head - Pain away incision/implant site - Dizziness - Sedation - Paraesthesia - Changes handwrite - Perseveration - Seizures - Coma - Paralysis - General problem - Transpiration - Warm cold feeling - Nail bite - Body smell change - Hair pull - Hair loss - Skin skin attachment infection - Laboratory test abnormality - Increased creatine kinase - Low ferritine - Increased amylase - Hypercholesterolemia - Diabetes mellitus - Psychiatric cognitive problem - Irritability - Suicidality ( thoughts/attempts ) - Increased depression - Increased anxiety - Increased OCD - Aggression/violent behaviour - Angry - Overdrive - Memory complaint - Disinhibition - Recklessness - Hyperactivity - Logorrhoea - Accident proneness - Hypomania - Cognitive disturbance ( cloud ) - Panic attack - Tension/nervousness - Hysteria - Apathy - Loss motivation - Lack energy - Flashbacks - Confusion - Blackouts - Derealisation/depersonalisation - Excessive alcohol drink - Medication abuse - Paranoia - Delusion - Family problem Below list possible adverse event rechargeable nonrechargeable neurostimulators DBS OCD : - A heating sensation neurostimulator recharge - Local skin irritation neurostimulator recharge - Hardware failure recharger include breakage recharger fixation belt . - Insufficient quality connection energy transfer rechargeable neurostimulator recharger . - The battery rechargeable stimulator always need recharge totally empty . After one episode totally empty battery proper function neurostimulator replacement within propose study design guarantee constructor . A committee consist principle investigator decide whether adverse event definitely , probably , possibly adverse event due system DBS OCD . All expect unexpected adverse event note publish . BIOSTATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS Paired statistical test continuous data ( A , f , PW , number consultation , ) ordinal data ( Y‐BOCS , GAF , HAM‐A , HAM‐D , BDI ) pre‐ post‐implantation , well descriptive statistic continuous data ( number recharge session , number battery status control , battery longevity , preferred stimulator type replacement ) , use . No power calculation perform . ETHICS Approval UZ/KU Leuven Ethics Committee , work ICH‐GCP principle , ask . All data collect objective , careful precise manner . All risk keep low possible meticulous implantation procedure careful clinical evaluation implantation . Participation study completely voluntary .</detailed_description>
