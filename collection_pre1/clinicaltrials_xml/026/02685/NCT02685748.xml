	<brief_title>Aspirin Young Psychotic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia psychiatric paradigm one mysterious mental illness , decade remain challenge many clinician researcher complex , fundamental mechanism . Soft neurological sign ( SNS ) describe non-localized neurological abnormality associate damage specific brain region . It believe part well-defined neurological syndrome . They include neurological abnormality deficit sensory integration , motor coordination sequence complex motor act . They high prevalence schizophrenic patient compare healthy population . Moreover , SNS consistently demonstrate neuroleptic naive patient first episode illness . There also increase prevalence non- schizophrenic relative patient schizophrenia . It consider potentiated antipsychotic . For reason believe inherent quality schizophrenia - `` trait '' marker , endophenotypes . According so-called `` Two hit '' hypothesis development schizophrenia , two period increase vulnerability . The first one fetal age come interaction genetic environmental factor infection inflammatory process may also serve function . The second period vulnerability period adolescence , early adult age influence environmental factor lead clinical manifestation disease . It think cytokine key role first strike . Cytokines mediator communication neural element aspect development nervous system . Until , numerous study indicate modification specific cytokine psychotic disorder possible role propose concept `` microglial hypothesis '' schizophrenia . Hypothesis activation Th1 Th2 immune response , predominance Th2 immune response propose schizophrenia . Type-17 cytokine important mediate tissue damage autoimmune disease . Regulatory cytokine suppress immune response maintain self-tolerance . Consequently , question whether combination antipsychotic drug anti-inflammatory drug useful independent antipsychotic therapy ? Laan colleague 2010. carry randomize , double- blind , placebo - control study determine adjuvant aspirin therapy could useful patient already take antipsychotic . They conclude therapy antipsychotic + aspirin significantly superior placebo + antipsychotic therapy . PANSS score significantly low aspirin group . The aim study would determine effect adjuvant aspirin therapy soft neurological sign , PANSS cytokine profile . The investigator expect reduction PANSS score group patient ( aspirin group placebo group ) . In case significant reduction SNS cytokine profile experimental group , result would go favour cytokine hypothesis . If significant change SNS experimental group , result would support SNS trait characteristic schizophrenia . The research would do hospitalized patient Clinic Psychiatric Disorders `` Dr Laza Lazarevic '' Belgrade . Part study ( immunology ) do Medical Faculty University Kragujevac . The study would randomize , double-blind , placebo control two parallel group 50 60 patient neuroleptic naive previously minimally medicate ( past 6 month without antipsychotic treatment ) duration illness seven year . The study would involve patient sex , age 18 28 year , accord ICD 10 criterion satisfy diagnosis F 20 F 29 . Each patient enters hospital meet inclusion criterion would take consideration . If patient satisfies exclusion criterion sign consent , s/he would randomize two group : Experimental group ( antipsychotic + aspirin ) Control group ( antipsychotic + placebo ) . Patients EG would receive 1,000 mg aspirin pro die pantoprazole 40 mg pro die two dos gastric protection . Only one researcher would know group patient belongs ( would responsible randomization , would rater treat psychiatrist ) . The researcher would give box medication mark patient 's name . In fact , medication ( aspirin , pantoprazole , placebo ) would package look capsule . The protocol would consist three plan visit patient group . On first visit blood sample would take implementation immunological test well laboratory inflammatory factor ; patient would subject clinical psychiatric physical examination , BMI measurement ; PANSS scale do . After calm sign acute psychosis , 3rd day , patient would examine Heidelberg MoCA scale ; patient would start take Aspirin Placebo . At end 6th week second visit , third visit , blood sample would take analyze cytokine profile inflammatory factor . PANSS , Heidelberg MoCA scale would perform . The investigator would consider follow factor : patient sex , age patient , clinical characteristic , role heredity , type therapy/ prescribe typical atypical antipsychotic ; side effect treatment type treatment response . Serum concentration cytokine examine commercial ELISA test .</detailed_description>
