	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) highly prevalent disable disorder associate persistent low mood , loss capacity experience pleasure ( i.e . anhedonia ) , reduce social functioning , impaired quality life . MDD estimate affect approximately 2 % Canadian woman 1 % Canadian men point time . The World Health Organization affirm depression lead cause disability worldwide , increase global economic impact .

Music- sound-related therapy potential serve adjunct , facilitator , medication . Several recent systematic review conclude music effective therapeutic tool significant result improve global state , symptom , overall functioning , also well-accepted patient . The goal project evaluate effectiveness music rhythmic sensory stimulation low-frequency sound adjunctive therapy depression . Through systematic collection clinical , behavioural electrophysiological measure , project also aim determine possible mechanism underlie effect music- sound-based therapy symptom MDD . In addition measure depression severity symptom , also interested secondary behavioral measure address possible confounding variable , anhedonia , quality life , individual difference people experience reward pleasure associate music . These assessment allow initial investigation neural correlate therapeutic effect music treatment depression , greatly warrant good understand efficacy music- sound-based treatment .</detailed_description>
