	<brief_summary>In study , investigator evaluate whether age-specific diurnal change marker cortical plasticity child , adolescent adult . The question investigate quantification brain metabolites structural brain volume use magnet resonance imaging ( MRI ) electrophysiological marker use sleep encephalography ( sleep EEG ) . In second step , test marker cortical plasticity change depend modulation sleep apply tone deep sleep .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Given child adolescent undergo entirely different maturational process ( child show increase , adolescent decrease synapse density ) large diurnal change child expect compare adolescent concern brain metabolite structural marker . These cortical change synapse density think reflect electrophysiological marker sleep EEG ( child show high slow wave activity , adolescent reduce slow wave activity ) . With modulation deep ( slow wave ) sleep play short , low volume tone , investigator want test causal relationship slow wave sleep marker cortical plasticity .</detailed_description>
