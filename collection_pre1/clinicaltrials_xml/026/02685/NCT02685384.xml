The ADVANCE CDRN patient-level data 470 CHCs 12 Medicaid expansion state ( n=1,242,823 patient ) 248 CHCs 9 non-expansion state ( n=830,399 patient ) . This nationally unique data resource let investigator measure pre-post DM-related utilization receipt preventive service expansion versus non-expansion state , illuminate impact ACA Medicaid expansion DM prevention treatment Our propose study , Post ACA Reform : EValuation community hEalth ceNTer care Diabetes ( PREVENT-D ) follow specific aim : Aim 1 .
