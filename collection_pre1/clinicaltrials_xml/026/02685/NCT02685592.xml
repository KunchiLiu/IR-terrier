	<brief_summary>This study investigate efficacy photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) treatment lentigo maligna ( LM ) . Hyperspectral image system ( HIS ) use determine margin LM rule possible invasion . Participants receive photodynamic therapy three time consecutively interval two week use 5-aminolevulinic acid nanoemulsion ( BF-200 ALA , Ameluz® ) light sensitize cream . Four week last photodynamic therapy lentigo maligna lesion excise surgically skin . Result treatment assess histopathological examination immunohistochemical staining remove tissue specimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Lentigo Maligna Using 5-aminolevulinic Acid Nanoemulsion Light Sensitizing Cream</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lentigo maligna ( LM ) in-situ form melanoma occur sun-exposed skin . Untreated LM progress invasive lentigo maligna melanoma ( LMM ) . The incidence LM/LMM constantly increase population grows older lifelong sun-exposure rise . Clinically difficult determine borderline LM well differentiate LMM LM . A novel imaging method hyperspectral imaging system ( HIS ) use delineate margin LM spot invasion inside LM lesion . The gold standard treatment LM surgical excision adequate ( ≥5 mm ) margin . Due large size LM lesion typical location face neck surgical treatment challenge cause aesthetic functional deficit patient . Furthermore , LM patient tend elderly may anesthetic contraindication . Other treatment modality LM study none still prove efficient enough . Recently , photodynamic treatment ( PDT ) suggest promising novel treatment method LM . In prospective pilot study investigate whether photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) effective treatment lentigo maligna . 10-15 patient histologically confirm lentigo maligna include trial . The study course follow : During first visit clinic , suspect LM lesion examine clinically Wood 's lamp image HIS camera . Elicited margin method mark transparent sheet treatment area photograph . A biopsy take darkest-colored part LM confirm diagnosis rule invasion . Next , patient receive PDT treatment three time 2 week ' interval . Before apply Ameluz® light sensitizer gel skin treatment area prepare fractional ablative CO2-laser enhance absorption . After light sensitizer absorption LM lesion illuminate artificial red light ( Aktilite CL128 lamp ) use light dose 90 J/cm2 . Finally 4 week last PDT treatment LM excise surgically use 5 mm margin . The efficacy PDT assess surgical excision histopathological examination immunohistochemical staining ( MART , Mel-5 MITF stain ) . The final result treatment control 6 month surgical excision .</detailed_description>
