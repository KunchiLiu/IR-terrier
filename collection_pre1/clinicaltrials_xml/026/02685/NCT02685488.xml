	<brief_summary>Depression lead cause disability worldwide . Because significant number people depression respond medication therapy , alternative treatment option greatly need . Recent research focus brain stimulation method due therapeutic utility treat depression . Yet , current brain stimulation method drawback , include invasive surgery limit precision target specific area . A novel brain stimulation method , transcranial ultrasound ( TUS ) , noninvasive , great spatial precision exist method , proven safe human . TUS find increase positive mood chronic pain patient . In double blind study , TUS increase positive mood 140 healthy undergraduate University Arizona . Despite evidence TUS increase positive mood human , yet investigate whether TUS increase positive mood human experience chronic low mood depression . The present study , first time , examine whether TUS improve depressive symptom . Twenty thirty participant mild moderate depressive symptom ( Beck Depression Inventory Score 10 25 ) randomly assign TUS sham TUS activation condition . In TUS activation condition , TUS use stimulate right fronto-temporal area , previously show increase positive mood . Participants TUS sham condition receive brain stimulation . Participants attend five session within seven day ten session within fourteen day . At session , addition brain stimulation , self-reported mood depressive symptom record . Furthermore , investigator use electroencephalogram ( EEG ) record change brain electrical signal TUS stimulation . Based prior research , investigator predict mood increase depressive symptom decrease TUS stimulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants first complete online screen qualify complete study contact via telephone ( see telephone recruitment consent procedure ) . After provide informed consent , first day , participant randomly assign either TUS treatment TUS sham condition ( placebo ) , study double blind . Participants TUS treatment condition ( sham treatment unknown participant experimenter ) TUS stimulation right fronto-temporal area five time within seven day ten time within fourteen day . Participants sign first five session first remind participant may withdraw study time . Should participant choose continue second week treatment , participant schedule another five session . In word , participant option complete 10 day procedure . The procedure differ week 1 week 2 . However , participant compensate less week 2 . Participants option continue week 2 , participant may find treatment benefiting . The first , fifth , tenth day study take approximately 2 hour second , third , fourth , sixth , seventh , eighth , ninth take one hour . In sham condition , ultrasound probe place right fronto-temporal area five time course seven day ten time course fourteen day without stimulation . Prior research show stimulation area induces positive mood change implicate positive mood . On first , middle , last day procedure ( day 1 , 5 , 10 ) , EEG data collect . On second , third , fourth day well sixth ninth day procedure EEG data collect TUS stimulation occur . Collecting EEG data point allow comparison rest electrical brain profile begin study end study . Additionally , investigator assess state mood rumination TUS , well depressive anxiety symptom end day . The state mood rumination allow u examine mood effect TUS , whereas depressive anxiety symptom questionnaire allow u examine change important profile course study .</detailed_description>
