	<brief_title>Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging Distinguish Functional Dyspepsia From Reflux Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional dyspepsia ( FD ) acid/bile reflux disease common . These disease share similar clinical manifestation . Individuals functional dyspepsia ( FD ) often present upper abdominal pain discomfort , bloating , early satiety , loss appetite , organic factor underlie . Individuals suffer acid/bile reflux disease often complain heartburn , upper abdominal burning discomfort . What , always specific change traditional endoscopy use differentiate disease ( except erosive esophagitis ) . Though proton-pump inhibitor ( PPI ) test frequently apply confirm diagnosis acid reflux disease , certain amount individual gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) show favorable response PPI test . In order make distinction disease , esophageal pH-metry need , however always available clinic . Recent data show new endoscopic technology Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging could demonstrate indistinct lesion cause GERD detectable standard endoscopy , subsequently improve endoscopic diagnosis disease . In addition , simultaneous analysis gastric juice help determine whether bile reflux present . As know , pathologic reflux underlie functional dyspepsia acid/bile reflux disease . Hence , hypothesize Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging combination simultaneous analysis gastric juice could use differentiate functional dyspepsia acid/bile reflux disease .</detailed_description>
