	<brief_summary>This single-arm open-label phase I/II study determine relative superiority αCD19-TCRζ-CD28 αCD19-TCRζ-CD137 CAR-T Cells safety , efficacy engraftment potential patient CD19+ B-lineage leukemia lymphoma . Recently , cancer immunotherapy , treatment aim arm patient immunity specifically cancer cell , emerge promising therapeutic strategy . Clinical trial utilize CARs B cell malignancy demonstrate remarkable potential . In trial , subject competitively infused αCD19-TCRz-CD28 αCD19-TCRz-CD137 CAR-T cell equal number test hypothesis CD137-costimulation promote persistence engraftment CAR-T cell superiority lead improve progression-free survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective 1 . To determine safety feasibility adoptive transfer T cell modify express CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor ( CD19CAR ) treatment leukemia lymphoma Secondary objectives 1 . To measure efficacy anti-tumor response CD19CAR T cell infusion 2 . To determine CD19CAR T cell engineer 4-1BB signal domain superior CD28 signal domain home persistence CD19CAR T cell infusion</detailed_description>
