	<brief_summary>Objective : Safety efficacy low-dose prostacyclin administration blood pressure target addition standard therapy , compare standard therapy alone , post-cardiac-arrest-syndrome ( PCAS ) patient . Trial Rationale : Therapeutic intervention direct towards damage endothelium may improve outcome patient PCAS . Prostacyclin/Iloprost ( PGI2 ) endogenous prostanoid form release endothelial cell anti-platelet , vasodilatory cytoprotective properties36 expect beneficial protect deactivate endothelium restore vascular integrity patient suffer endothelial breakdown . Trial Population : Participants trial must adult patient ( ≥18 year age ) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) presume cardiac cause admit Dept . Cardiology , 2143 , Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen . Trial Design : Randomized , placebo control , double-blind investigator-initiated trial 40 OHCA patient . 48 hour active study drug ( Iloprost , 1 ng/kg/min ) versus placebo ( saline ) infusion . Patients randomization group treat accordance state-of-the art therapy include target temperature management . Interventions consider emergency procedure study drug infusion commence soon possible sustained return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) , screen randomization . Patients enrol informed consent , treatment initiate early possible hospital cardiac arrest diagnosis i.e. , time-point patient temporarily incompetent , scientific guardian co-sign informed consent form inclusion . Next-of-kin patient ' general practitioner co-sign soon possible patient provide inform consent whenever possible . During study , blood sample take different time point . Patients observe assessed continuously regard complication include bleeding . Patients actively assess long patient ICU . During extended follow period day 30 , 90 180 contact make patient follow safety event vital status . The trial conduct accordance protocol approve Danish health medicine authority , Danish ethic committee danish data protection agency . Investigational product : The active treatment trial 1 ng/kg/min Ilomedin® administer 48h continuous i.v infusion . The drug administer accord product specification . Placebo : The placebo 0.9 % saline administer 48h continuous i.v infusion . The i.v volume placebo saline administer equal administered volume dilute ( 0.9 % saline ) active drug . Sponsor study financial support : This research project investigator-initiated trial Sponsor Pär I. Johansson collaboration principal investigator Christian Hassager . It receive fund commercial sponsor . Patient recruitment period run February 2016 June 2017 . Follow-up data 30-day , 90-day 180-day outcome adverse event collect . Initial data analysis do completion 30-day follow-up patient . Secondary data analysis do completion 180-day follow-up patient .</brief_summary>
