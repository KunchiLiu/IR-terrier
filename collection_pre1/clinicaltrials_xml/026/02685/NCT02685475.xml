	<brief_summary>Background objective : The investigator perform study explore whether presence diabetes mellitus ( DM ) would affect outcomes axillary brachial plexus block ( ABPBs ) patient undergo elective forearm and/or hand surgery . The primary hypothesis sensory block duration would delay diabetic patient . Methods : After obtain ethic committee approval write informed consent , 71 patient enrol study . Diabetic patient include Group DM non-diabetics include Group NODM . All receive ultrasound-guided ABPBs mixture 10 mL lidocaine 2 % 20 mL bupivacaine 0.5 % . Our primary outcome sensory block duration , secondary outcome sensory motor block onset time , motor block duration , time-to-first-pain ( numeric rating scale ( NRS ) ≥4 ) , postoperative NRS score rescue analgesic consumption ( NRS ) ≥4 ) postoperative first 2 day . All outcome assess blind investigator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background objective : The impact diabetes mellitus ( DM ) practice peripheral nerve block anesthesia mostly investigate animal research , effect human model require clarify . The investigator perform study explore whether presence DM would affect outcomes axillary brachial plexus block ( ABPBs ) patient undergo elective forearm and/or hand surgery . The primary hypothesis sensory block duration would delay diabetic patient . Methods : After obtain ethic committee approval write informed consent , 71 patient American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status I-III age 40 75 year enrol study . Diabetic patient include Group DM non-diabetics include Group NODM . All receive ultrasound-guided ABPBs mixture 10 mL lidocaine 2 % 20 mL bupivacaine 0.5 % . Postoperatively , patient administer paracetamol rescue analgesic , numeric rating scale ( NRS ) ≥4 . Our primary outcome sensory block duration , secondary outcome sensory motor block onset time , motor block duration , time-to-first-pain ( numeric rating scale ( NRS ) ≥4 ) , postoperative NRS score , rescue analgesic consumption ( NRS ) ≥4 ) postoperative first 2 day .
