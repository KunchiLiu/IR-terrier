	<brief_title>VectorFlow Tunneled Dialysis Catheter ( TDC ) Versus Palindrome TDC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The VectorFlow tunnel dialysis catheter novel symmetrical tip design tunnel dialysis catheter pre-clinical test retrospective review improve flow patency compare dialysis catheter design . This study compare 90 day patency rate newly insert VF catheter Palindrome catheter FDA approve device insert standard care . The Palindrome catheter select comparison device also symmetrical tip catheter design prior study manufacturer device suggest low occlusion rate well flow compare catheter design .</detailed_description>
