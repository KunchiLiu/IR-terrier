The study period patient 27 week , patient undergo screen 21 day , follow treatment 24 week follow period 2 week . Each patient require make total 9 visit . After re-confirming eligibility patient Visit 2 , eligible patient randomly assign either treatment group control group 2:1 ratio . In addition , patient treatment group receive ENIA11 25 mg twice weekly subcutaneous injection patient control group receive placebo solution twice weekly subcutaneous injection Day 0 week 12 switch active drug week 12 week 24 follow period 2 week . The efficacy analysis , include ASAS response measure , ASAS5/6 , ASDAS , BASDAS , BASFI , BASMI individual measure disease activity , number swell tender joint , ESR CRP , evaluate visit Visit 2 ( baseline ) Visit 9 . Safety evaluate accord frequency adverse event , vital sign , physical examination , laboratory abnormality , ENIA11 antibody formation .</brief_summary>
