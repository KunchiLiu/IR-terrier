	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect intake two orange juice variety healthy adult . The participant receive `` Bahia '' orange juice , `` Cara-Cara '' orange juice isocaloric control drink cross-over study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolomic Approach Evaluate Effect Orange Juice Intake Healthy Humans ( METABORANGE ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The consumption fruit vegetable link decrease incidence chronic disease . Citrus fruit represent main source bioactive compound flavonoid , vitamin C carotenoid brazilian diet . Unlike `` Bahia '' , `` Cara Cara '' variety spontaneous mutation `` Washington navel '' orange characterize bright red pulp due high level lycopene . This difference chemical composition may lead different biological activity great protective effect health . Since biological effect generate food intake result interaction various nutrient different metabolic pathway , investigator apply metabolomic approach investigate complex relationship fruit intake , bioactive compound human metabolism . The investigator propose describe metabolic pathway affect orange juice intake identify biomarkers use nutritional intervention .</detailed_description>
