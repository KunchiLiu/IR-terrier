	<brief_summary>Objective : To investigate use newly design Alexis O Retractor lead improved intra-operative post-operative surgical outcome set plan elective Caesarean Sections . Study Design : This ethically approve study design prospective , randomize control trial plan , first time Caesarean Sections 200 patient randomize either Alexis-O Retractor group conventional group . Patients wound heal problem , connective tissue disorder , insulin dependent diabetes , bleed disorder , previous major abdominal surgery chorioamnionitis exclude . Outcomes include surgical site infection , intraoperative parameter tissue damage , postoperative analgesia requirement patient satisfaction score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Site Infection Caesarean Section Using Alexis O Compared Metal Retractors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main Hypothesis : Does use newly design Alexis O Retractor lead improve Surgical Site Infection rate intra-operative post-operative surgical outcome set plan elective first time Caesarean Sections patient compare traditional self-retaining metal retractor ? Secondary Hypotheses : Does Alexis O Retractor lead improve intra-operative post-operative surgical outcome set plan elective Caesarean Sections ? Study Design : The Study design prospective , randomize control trial 100 patient randomize Alexis O Retractor group 100 patient conventional group . All patient recruit follow thorough discussion purpose methodology study full document consent obtain prior randomization . Patients wound heal problem , connective tissue disorder , diabetes , bleed disorder , previous abdominal surgery apart laparoscopy chorioamnionitis exclude . All surgical operator thoroughly train use application Alexis O Retractor prior start study support regular teaching demonstration . The Obstetric Theatre Team inform train use application Alexis O Retractor within Study Design . Ethical Approval : Ethical Approval already obtain Ethics committee Charit√© University Hospital Committee keep ethical standard . Statistics : - Data analysis statistical comparison perform appropriate robust statistical methodology . - Comparisons investigate - Subjective Assessment Ease Application Retractor Instrument - Incision Delivery Time - Incision Skin Suture Time - Subjective Assessment Visualized Operative Field - Subjective Assessment Freedom Surgical Movement - Interference Descending Bowel Adnexal Tissue - Bowel Bladder Trauma - Need Bowel Packing - Need Paracolic Cleaning Blood Amniotic Fluid - Need Uterus Exteriorization Intraoperatively - Fascial Trauma - Muscle Trauma - Muscle Suturing - Coagulation Subcutaneous Tissue - Subcutaneous Tissue Thickness - Skin Lacerations - Trauma Baby - Estimated Blood Loss - Ease Retractor Removal - Analgesia Requirements Post Operative - Wound Healing Problems Discharge 6 Weeks ( Telephone Interview ) - Wound Infections ( As define Centers Disease Control ) - Time Hospital Discharge - 6-Week Scar Pain Scores ( Telephone Interview ) - Patient Satisfaction Wound Healing ( Telephone Interview )</detailed_description>
