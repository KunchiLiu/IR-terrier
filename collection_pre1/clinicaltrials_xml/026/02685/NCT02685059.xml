	<detailed_description>To date target agent available treat TNBC . Therefore chemotherapy treatment option . TNBC often high amount tumour infiltrate lymphocyte . Stimulating immune cell TNBC might therefore option patient increase pathological complete response . pCR highly correlate outcome TNBC . Therefore addition checkpoint inhibitor addition chemotherapy might additional option patient . The primary objective therefore compare pathological complete response ( pCR= ypT0 ypN0 ) rate neoadjuvant treatment sequential , nab-Paclitaxel follow EC +/- PD-L1 antibody MEDI4736 patient early triple negative breast cancer .</detailed_description>

Unilateral bilateral primary carcinoma breast , confirm histologically core biopsy . Fineneedle aspiration alone sufficient . Incisional biopsy allow . In case bilateral cancer , investigator decide prospectively side evaluated primary endpoint . Tumor lesion breast palpable size &gt; =2 cm sonographical size &gt; =1 cm maximum diameter . The lesion measurable two dimension , preferably sonography . In case inflammatory disease , extent inflammation use measurable lesion . Patients must follow stage disease : cT1b cT4ad irrespective nodal involvement . In patient multifocal multicentric breast cancer , large lesion measure . Triple negative disease centrally confirm ER negative/PR negative/HER2 negative , centrally confirm Ki67 value . ER/PR negative define &lt; 1 % stained cell HER2negative define either IHC 0/1+ IHC 2+ insitu hybridisation ( ISH ) either ratio &lt; 2.0 less 6 copy HER2 per tumor cell . Stromal TILs evaluate three group : immune infiltrate ( 010 % stromal TILs ) intermediate immune infiltrate ( 1159 % stromal TILs ) , LPBC 60100 % stromal TILs .
