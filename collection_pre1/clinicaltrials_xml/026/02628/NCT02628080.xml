	<brief_summary>Solid tumour often highly disorganised vasculature result low oxygenation . This combined high metabolic rate lead oxygen demand outstrip supply cause tumour hypoxia . Hypoxia drive multiple cellular process involve hallmark cancer . Tumour hypoxia also decrease effectiveness anticancer treatment . This especially true patient treat radiotherapy since long recognise hypoxic tumour cell require 3 time dose radiation cause amount cell death cell irradiate normal oxygen condition . To date , majority attempt overcome tumour hypoxia focus increase oxygen supply . However , technique produce modest benefit best subsequently adopt current clinical practice . An interesting alternative approach tackle tumour hypoxia decrease oxygen 'demand ' reduce tumour oxygen consumption . This strategy suggest effective reduce hypoxia previous method aim increase oxygen delivery . Pre-clinical data demonstrate commonly prescribe anti-protozoal drug atovaquone significantly reduce oxygen consumption variety tumour cell line vitro . This reduction oxygen consumption lead profound reduction tumour hypoxia animal model . It anticipate effect tumour hypoxia could reproduce human , tumour could render markedly sensitive radiotherapy . This window opportunity trial ass whether atovaquone significantly reduce tumour hypoxia adult patient refer surgery suspect non-small cell lung cancer . This assess use combination functional imaging circulate marker hypoxia . If atovaquone demonstrate result reduction tumour hypoxia , large clinical trial conduct determine whether well-tolerated inexpensive agent improve radiotherapy efficacy clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
