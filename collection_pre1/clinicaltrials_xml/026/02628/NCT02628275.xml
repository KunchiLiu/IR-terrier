	<brief_summary>Subclinical atherosclerosis identify roughly 2/3rd otherwise healthy young adult . How much physical activity require prevent progression subclinical atherosclerosis ? In 85 % healthy young Canadian men woman NOT perform recommend 150 min/week moderate- vigorous-intensity physical activity ( MVPA ) recommend , reasonable aim lower regimen light physical activity ( LPA ) despite absence support literature , contrary investigator insist achieve MVPA ? In perspective , MoMA provide unique opportunity determine whether LPA vs. MVPA necessary limit subclinical atherosclerosis progression inactive otherwise healthy adult . Resolving unknowns inform strategy prevent decades silent disease progression lead future morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Mild Moderate Physical Activity Progression Subclinical Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain rampant developed region , top list cause mortality lead 29 % death . In addition mortality , economic impact morbidity hospitalization relate CVD cost Canadians $ 22.2 billion every year . By far lead cause CVD atherosclerosis define thicken arterial wall fatty deposit . Therefore , atherosclerosis underlie mechanism behind # 1 cause mortality morbidity develop region . Autopsy study perform healthy casualty Korean , Vietnam , Iraq Afghanistan Wars reveal atherosclerosis present 78 % young men 30th birthday , even absence traditional risk factor ( high blood pressure , dyslipidemia , obesity ) . Prevention atherosclerosis silent progression towards clinical event decade later therefore become priority young adult . A potentially powerful avenue cardiovascular prevention lie reduction subclinical atherosclerosis progression young adults physical activity . Unfortunately , 15 % Canadians meet current recommendation 150min/week moderate- vigorous-intensity physical activity ( MVPA ) . In response observation Canadians simply n't find time for/or appear value current recommendation , suggest even light-intensity physical activity ( LPA ) might improve biomarker level compare sedentary lifestyle . It appear face fail attempt convince Canadians perform 150min/week MVPA , expectation towards LPA lower despite absence convincing data . MoMA randomize control trial study effect two dos physical activity subclinical atherosclerosis burden progression ; 270 inactive men woman age 18-40 year without CVD risk factor enrol . At baseline , risk factor , physical activity level nutritional habit measure validated questionnaire ; blood work anthropometric parameter measurement perform ( marker cardiometabolic risk ) ; fitness level assess treadmill test accelerometer ; magnetic resonance image carotid atherosclerosis , liver adipose tissue perform .</detailed_description>

Known dyslipidemia ( participant receive lipidlowering medication , absence medication , : fasting total plasma cholesterol level &gt; 6.2 mmol/L , triglyceride level ≥ 1.7 mmol/L , and/or HDLcholesterol level &lt; 1.0 mmol/L men &lt; 1.3 mmol/L woman ) ; Hypertension ( participant receive antihypertensive medication blood pressure ≥ 135/85 mmHg ) ; Diabetes ( participant take diabetes medication plasma HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % ) ; Postmenopausal woman ; Pregnancy nursing past year expect next two year ; Contraindications MRI , per standardize IUCPQ MRI screen form ; Participation another research study .</criteria>
