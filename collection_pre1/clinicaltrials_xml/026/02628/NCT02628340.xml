	<brief_summary>HIV infection efficiently control antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , 2013 nearly 85 % patient suppress viremia , HIV , however , eradicate ART alone [ 1 ] . Overall , HIV move fatal chronic disease provide treatment maintain life-long . Despite major improvement antiretroviral drug term efficacy , tolerability simplicity , life-long therapy still associate drug toxicity . Several drug drug class , historically save life since 1996 currently widely use protease inhibitor nucleoside analogue , associate long-term toxicity increase incidence comorbidities . Currently , worldwide approximate 10 million HIV infect patient cART . This number increase next year , recent guideline recommend early therapy give benefit term disease progression prevention transmission . Because increase number patient cART future , cumulative ART toxicity , difficulty access ART area world , fatigue express patient ART cost issue , urgent need search HIV CURE . To date , two case sterilize HIV cure report far : famous `` Berlin Patient '' two homozygous Delta32-CCR5 bone-marrow graft acute leukemia [ 2 ] , Mississipi baby early initiation cART 31 hour delivery [ 3 ] . However case sterilize HIV cure remain exceptional alternative objective functional HIV cure appear realistic , though still describe rare group patient like Elite controller ( EC ) post treatment controller ( PTC ) patient . In addition new complex therapeutic strategy currently propose try purge HIV reservoir , none prove far able reach goal . Therefore objective finding Cure HIV [ 4 ] require first well understand basic mechanism persistence HIV reservoirs population chronically-infected fully-suppressed HIV+ patient order define future therapeutic strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comprehensive Analysis HIV Reservoirs Chronically Infected HIV-1 Treated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extremely low level HIV reservoirs achievable chronically-infected patient durably control cART . Despite multiplicity heterogeneity factor govern persistence HIV reservoir , low level HIV reservoirs seem necessary , though probably sufficient , reach status functional cure define virus control absence treatment . The mechanism associate low HIV reservoir chronic treat infection unknown might involve low immune activation inflammatory environment , deleterious HIV mutation . Understanding mechanisms provide novel clue future strategy aim obtain HIV Cure . The main objective RESACHRON Study define chronically infected patient suppress viremia , cART extremely low level HIV reservoir , viral cellular mechanism underlie persistence , size distribution HIV reservoirs among various CD4 T cell-subpopulations via comprehensive analysis use innovative highly miniaturize complementary immunological virological assay . Our first hypothesis HIV reservoirs persist even patient low undetectable HIV-DNA total PBMCs , detect ex vivo give rise HIV production CD4 T cell subset due mean 10-fold enrichment peripheral blood TCM TTM cell . The sort various sort CD4 TN , TCM , TTM , TEM key subset thus allow test whether subset : 1. virus genome intact contains deletion interfere replicative capacity , 2 . HIV production induce vitro distinct activation signal , 3 . HIV transcripts detectable ex-vivo , 4 . Low immune activation inflammatory environment associate extremely low HIV reservoir level test series plasma pro-inflammatory molecule together cell surface activation marker intra-cellular transcriptional signature .</detailed_description>
