Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , R-ICE , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving lenalidomide R-ICE may better treatment patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R-ICE Lenalidomide Treating Patients With First-Relapse/Primary Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) addition lenalidomide R-ICE chemoimmunotherapy regimen ( lenalidomide-rituximab-ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide [ R2ICE ] ) treatment primary-refractory/first-relapse B-cell lymphoma . ( Phase I ) II . To determine addition lenalidomide ( base dose determination phase I ) R-ICE chemoimmunotherapy regimen ( R2-ICE ) would lead clinically meaningful improvement overall response rate ( ORR ) patient first-relapse/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect addition lenalidomide RICE number ( percentage ) patient proceed stem cell transplant ( SCT ) . II . To evaluate effect addition lenalidomide RICE surrogate outcome measure include complete metabolic response ( CMR ) rate overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. ORR base germinal center B-cell-like ( GCB ) versus non-GCB subtypes . II . Role positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) scan . III . Minimal residual disease ( MRD ) detection quantification . IV . Future tissue blood base study . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study lenalidomide follow phase II study . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily day 1-14 , rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , ifosfamide IV 24 hour day 2 , carboplatin IV 1-2 hour day 2 , etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve CMR , partial metabolic response ( PMR ) , metabolic response ( NMR ) may receive 2 course per physician discretion . After completion 2 cycle R2ICE treatment , patient achieve objective status CMR , PMR NMR may proceed SCT event monitoring phase . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year yearly 2 year .</detailed_description>
