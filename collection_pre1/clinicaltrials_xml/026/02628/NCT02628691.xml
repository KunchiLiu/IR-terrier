	<detailed_description>Data progression liver fibrosis patient co-infected HIV take effective suppressive antiretroviral therapy fibrosis mild-to-moderate fibrosis baseline scarce . This uncertainty reflect lack clear guidance need earlier ( F3-F4 ) treatment co-infected patient . Within hepatitis C/HIV co-infection project Cambodia , investigator opportunity monitor short-term fibrosis progression cohort co-infected patient initial no-to-moderate fibrosis identify another ongoing study ( HCV-Epi ) contribute relevant data aid risk/benefit analysis postpone HCV treatment HIV/HCV co-infected patient initial fibrosis stage F0-F2 . The HCV-Monitoring study mono-centric prospective cohort study propose standardize follow-up ( clinical , biological imaging ) monitor progression hepatitis C disease patient HIV infection ( anti-retroviral treatment ) Sihanouk Hospital Center Hope ( Phnom Penh , Cambodia ) chronic HCV infection GT-1 , -2 , -3 -6 consider immediate need HCV treatment . The study conduct Sihanouk Hospital Center Hope ( SHCH ) Phnom Penh ( Cambodia ) , particularly within ambulatory HIV clinic setting . SHCH non-governmental hospital provide comprehensive HIV care free charge since March 2003 , part national antiretroviral ( ARV ) program . They dispose experienced HIV clinician , counselor social worker team several operational research study conduct within set . All adult HIV-infected patient cohort ( ART yet ART ) Sihanouk hospital Center Hope identify HCV-Epi study chronic HCV infection ( genotype ) consider immediate need HCV treatment ( = Fibrosis stag F0-F2 clinical sign extra-hepatic disease ) consider inclusion invite participate . Approximately 70 HCV/HIV co-infected patient no-to-moderate hepatic fibrosis enrol study . No formal sample size calculate . The final sample comprise patient fulfil inclusion criterion . The data collect HCV-Epi study consider baseline visit HCV-Monitoring study . Thereafter , visit plan 6 , 12 , 18 24 month follow-up . These patient visit , beyond habitual HIV follow-up , integrate history take physical examination focus hepatic disease blood sample basic hematologic hepatic function parameter . Additionally , patient refer every year ultrasound transient elastography measurement sample additional liver function test measurement HCV-RNA viral load .</detailed_description>
