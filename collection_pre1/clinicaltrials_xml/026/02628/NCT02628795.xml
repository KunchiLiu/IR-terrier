	<brief_title>Overcoming TWEAK Signaling Restore Muscle Mobility After Joint Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While elective total hip ( THA ) knee ( TKA ) arthroplasty relieve pain improve mobility function thousand end-stage osteoarthritis ( OA ) , 35 % endure persistent muscle atrophy mobility limitation several year impact life quality , increase morbidity , burden healthcare system . Given THA/TKA volume increase exponentially &gt; 1.1 million US annually , refractory mobility impairment major public health problem . Together , available data raise two important knowledge gap THA/TKA rehabilitation : ( ) poorly understood factor limit responsiveness large number patient current usual care ; ( ii ) absence rehabilitation program prove overcome limitation . The propose project design fill gap . The investigator ' fundamental tenet restoration mobility function follow THA/TKA require : ( ) regeneration surgically damaged muscle ; ( ii ) regrowth muscle atrophy year OA limit usage . The investigator suggest major cause muscle regeneration impairment individual investigator identify muscle inflammation susceptibility ( MuIS ) - hyperactive inflammatory signal muscle MuIS ( + ) individual despite systemic inflammation - also manifest isolated primary satellite cell inhibit myogenesis vitro , indicative true cellular phenotype beyond niche . The investigator ' preliminary finding THA/TKA patient strongly suggest tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer apoptosis ( TWEAK ) signal pathway may central MuIS impair THA/TKA recovery , high perioperative muscle TWEAK signal ipsilateral thigh sensitive indicator impaired muscle protein synthesis fail strength recovery 8 wk usual care . Progressive resistance exercise training ( PRT ) putative anabolic intervention investigator find consistently increase muscle mass meet healthy standard atrophy mobility-impaired adult , activate muscle protein synthesis myogenic activity muscle satellite cell . Together , finding raise central hypothesis PRT plus adjunctive functional mobility training ( PRT+FM ) THA/TKA effectively restore muscle mass mobility function healthy standard usual care , MuIS ( + ) predict suffer fail muscle recovery persistent dismobility usual care , impact PRT+FM great MuIS ( + ) . The investigator thoroughly test hypothesis randomize control trial 88 THA/TKA patient follow aim . Aim 1 : To determine effect 16 wk PRT+FM vs. usual care elective THA/TKA muscle mass , performance , mobility function . Aim 2 : To determine whether MuIS status modifies effect PRT+FM usual care THA/TKA . Cellular molecular mechanism muscle mass regulation study detail . Aim 3 . To determine long-term impact 16 wk PRT+FM re-assessing outcome 6 mo 1 . The investigator fully expect novel finding lead paradigm shift THA/TKA rehabilitation profound impact grow segment population .</detailed_description>
