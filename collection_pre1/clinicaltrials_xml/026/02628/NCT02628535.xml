	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety MGD009 give patient B7-H3-expressing tumor . The study also evaluate high dose MGD009 give safely . Assessments do see drug act body ( pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) evaluate potential anti-tumor activity MGD009 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study MGD009 B7-H3-expressing Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase 1 open-label , dose escalation , cohort expansion , efficacy follow-up study MGD009 administer intravenously ( IV ) every-other-week schedule one year ( 14 cycle ) . The dose escalation phase design characterize safety tolerability MGD009 define maximum tolerate maximum administer dose ( MTD/MAD ) . This phase enroll patient mesothelioma , bladder cancer , melanoma , squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) , ovarian cancer , thyroid cancer , triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) , pancreatic cancer , colon cancer , soft tissue sarcoma , prostate cancer . In cohort expansion phase , 6 cohort 16 patient enrolled evaluate safety potential efficacy MGD009 administer MTD/MAD dose patient mesothelioma , bladder cancer , melanoma , SCCHN , NSCLC , specific tumor express high level B7-H3 . Pre- on-study biopsy require melanoma patient cohort expansion phase . The survival follow-up phase consist 2-year period final dose study drug . All tumor evaluation carry Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) .</detailed_description>
