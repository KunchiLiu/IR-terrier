	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis metastatic advance unresectable cancer unknown primary include adenocarcinoma , poorly differentiate adenocarcinoma , poorly differentiate carcinoma , squamous carcinoma . 2 . To categorized CUP , follow clinical evaluation must perform without identification anatomic primary site : medical history , physical examination , chemistry profile , blood count , serum PSA ( men ) , CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis , specific evaluation symptomatic area . 3 . Sufficient Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded tissue cancer study allow previously complete profiling panel treatment assignment ; however , FoundationOne profiling require part study . Adequate tumor tissue must remain , estimate consent physician , confirm genomic alteration enrol patient . Previous unknown primary available FoundationOne testing . ( Note : This FoundationOneÂ® profiling also allow require FoundationOne repeat . ) ( see Appendix A Appendix B ) 4 . First second line patient enrol study must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status score 0 2 . Third line patient enrol study must ECOG Performance Status score 0 1 ( Appendix C ) . 5 . Patients must measurable evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 ( Appendix D ) . 6 . Age great equal 18 year . 7 . Patients consider potential candidate treatment target therapy . 8 . Willingness ability comply study followup procedure . 9 . Ability understand nature study give write informed consent . 10 . The presence active cancer allow , unless indolent require therapy . Patients early stage cancer receive definitive local treatment consider unlikely recur eligible . All patient previously treat situ carcinoma ( i.e. , noninvasive ) eligible , patient history nonmelanoma skin cancer . 1 . Patients receive three line systemic therapy cancer unknown primary . 2 .
