	<brief_summary>This study examine potential benefit new antibiotic , Solithromycin , long-term treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Solithromycin hypothesise work reduce inflammation lung patient COPD . Stable COPD patient receive treatment solithromycin 28 day comparison make effect observed Solithromycin placebo . This include change inflammatory protein , lung function report symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Anti-inflammatory Effects Solithromycin Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common debilitate respiratory illness , kill around 30,000 people annually UK . The primary risk factor cigarette smoking , cause inflammation air passages lung . This inflammation irreversible result progressive lung destruction . Currently , effective anti-inflammatory medication available COPD . Inhalers remain mainstay regular treatment COPD . Macrolide antibiotic however , occasionally used supplementary treatment patient . They show anti-inflammatory . However , concern exist development bacterial resistance antibiotic . Consequently widely prescribe COPD . Solithromycin new macrolide antibiotic , show possess superior anti-inflammatory property . Importantly , bacteria far less likely develop resistance new medication . The current study ass effect solithromycin anti-inflammatory treatment COPD . 30 patient recruit receive 28 day treatment solithromycin placebo , follow 28 day wash period ( study medication ) , take 28 day treatment ( medication take first time around , i.e . either solithromycin placebo ) . This study single-centre ( Harefield Hospital ) , double-blind ( study team patient tell treatment take ) , randomise ( order solithromycin placebo take ) , placebo-controlled crossover design ( subject take solithromycin placebo separately ) . Sputum , blood fluid nasal line periodically sample examine effect level inflammatory cell proteins study . Any change lung function parameter symptom ( COPD Assessment Test ) also assess .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . History cigarette smoking &gt; 10 packyears . 2 . Postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.70 FEV1 3079 % predict normal value . 3 . Patients prescribe inhaled corticosteroid enrol . 4 . Females nonchildbearing potential : surgically sterile ( e.g . tubal ligation ) least 2 year postmenopausal . 5 . Females childbearing potential ( include female less 2 year postmenopausal ) must negative pregnancy test enrollment must agree use highly effective method birth control ( i.e . diaphragm plus spermicide male condom plus spermicide , oral contraceptive combination second method , contraceptive implant , injectable contraceptive , indwell intrauterine device , sexual abstinence , vasectomized partner ) participate study 30 day last dose study drug . 6 . The patient must willing able comply study visit procedure . 7 . The patient must suitable candidate oral therapy able swallow capsule intact . 8 . The patient must provide write informed consent . 9 . No evidence active bacterial infection sputum qPCR evaluation . 1 . Acute exacerbation COPD within previous 60 day washout period study . 2 . Any condition could possibly affect oral drug absorption , e.g . gastroenteritis , status post gastrectomy , status post bariatric surgery . 3 . Currently take medication HIV , chronic hepatitis B , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . 4 . Currently take theophylline xanthine medication . 5 . Currently take warfarin . 6 . Known concomitant infection ( pulmonary otherwise ) would require additional systemic antibiotic . 7 . QTc great 450 msec male female correct Fridericia formula . 8 . Current use drug know prolong QT interval , include Class Ia ( quinidine , procainamide ) Class III ( amiodarone , sotalol ) antiarrhythmic . 9 . Concomitant use drug , food , herbal product know moderate potent inhibitor CYP3A4 isozymes : oral antifungal agent ( e.g . ketoconazole , itraconazole , posaconazole , fluconazole voriconazole ) ; HIV protease inhibitor ( e.g . ritonavir saquinavir ) , HCV protease inhibitor ( e.g . boceprevir telaprevir ) , nefazodone , fluvoxamine , conivaptan , diltiazem , verapamil , aprepitant , ticlopidine , crizotinib , imatinib ; grapefruit grapefruit juice . 10 . Any use within prior 7 day drug herbal product know moderate potent inducer CYP3A4 isozymes : St. John 's Wort , rifampin , rifabutin , anticonvulsant ( e.g . phenobarbital , carbamazepine , phenytoin , rufinamide ) , modafinil , armodafinil , etraverine , efavirenz , bosentan . 11 . Required current use drug narrow therapeutic index principally metabolize CYP3A4 transport Pglycoprotein ( Pgp ) , drug interaction solithromycin could result high possibly unsafe exposure drug : e.g . Pgp substrates digoxin colchicine CYP3A4 substrates alfentanil , astemizole , cisapride , cyclosporine , dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , fentanyl , midazolam , pimozide , quinidine , sirolimus , tacrolimus , everolimus , terfenadine ) . 12 . History organ transplant . 13 . Cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation therapy within previous 3 month . 14 . Known neuromuscular disorder clinical history ( e.g . myasthenia gravis , Parkinson 's disease ) . 15 . Known significant renal , hepatic , hematologic impairment . 16 . Women pregnant breast feed 17 . Prior participation protocol . 18 . Any investigational drug take investigational device use within 4 week administration first dose study drug . 19 . History intolerance hypersensitivity macrolide antibiotic . 20 . Any concomitant condition , opinion Investigator , would preclude evaluation response make unlikely contemplated course therapy followup could complete ( e.g . life expectancy &lt; 30 day ) .</criteria>
