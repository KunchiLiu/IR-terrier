	<detailed_description>Normal age associate gradual cognitive decline . These mild neurocognitive disturbance affect daily functioning , health status , quality life , likely account roughly $ 2.9 billion lose elderly year fraud . People pay million pocket cognitive training program like Lumosity stave decline . These cognitive decrease strongly associate normal age-dependent decline neural structure function , include cortical thickness decrease ( approximately 0.02 mm per decade ) across cortical mantle , well decrease volume hippocampus ( approximately 1-2 % annually ) , white matter microstructure , functional connectivity across brain . Life expectancy increase identify intervention widely implement slow reverse normal cognitive decline clinical public health priority . Some training program improve cognitive performance cognitively normal old adult , gain maintain post training . The investigator hypothesize different technique boost cognition likely work different neural mechanism , thus may provide different cognitive benefit . The goal project compare two different 8-week training program promote successful neural cognitive aging . Changes neural structure cognitive function assess cohort older adult , well long-term stability change 24 month .</detailed_description>
