	<brief_title>Effects Resistance Training Program Older Women With Sarcopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New sarcopenia ( i.e . age-related loss muscle mass ) guideline establish 2014 recommend identify old individual intervention low muscle strength and/or gait speed functional measure associate low muscle mass subsequent negative health consequence increase mortality risk . Moreover , consensus guideline indicate research , especially old woman , need conduct test efficacy periodized ( i.e . planned variation program ) resistance exercise training ( RT ) protocols individual identify sarcopenic risk sarcopenia . Our interdisciplinary research group conduct publish result several intervention study older adult would like expand line research fill critical gap current research . The broad objective research project help determine efficacy periodized RT intervention strategy treat sarcopenia presarcopenia correlate among old woman . The specific primary aim determine significant effect RT program improve physical functioning muscle mass old woman . Exploratory aim determine impact RT intervention measure include bone density , lipoproteins , health indicator . The long-term goal project generate essential data submission comprehensive NIH private agency grant . The research design randomize trial control group methodology study include 25 community-dwelling old woman ( age 65-84 year ) 12-week repeat measure ( baseline , 6 week , post ) randomize study six month observational follow-up . After baseline testing , participant randomize either RT intervention group ( RTI ) active control ( CON ) group . The RT intervention take place three time per week non-consecutive day use 8-10 exercise major muscle group utilize free weight machine follow American College Sports Medicine National Strength Conditioning Association guideline RT old adult . The CON group meet three time weekly light physical activity stretch . The relevance research significant study date specifically examine RT old woman identify sarcopenic presarcopenic use newly establish guideline . This study accept potential participant meet inclusion criterion , regardless ethnic , racial , religious background .</detailed_description>
