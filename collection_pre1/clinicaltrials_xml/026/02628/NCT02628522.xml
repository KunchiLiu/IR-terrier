	<brief_summary>Investigators perform prospective pilot study test feasibility safety autologous adipose derive regenerative cell ( ADRC ) transplantation treatment anal fissure . The study include 6 patient chronic anal fissure symptoms average duration 24 month . All patient candidate surgical treatment previous conservative treatment unsuccessful . The pain level measure use VAS scale record treatment every consultation follow treatment . The initial hypothesis application ADRCs may alternative lateral sphincterotomy reliable procedure avoid fecal incontinence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective pilot study include 6 patient suffer chronic anal fissure . All patient previously treat different local application glyceryl trinitrate topical Xylocaine gel . Some patient take oral analgesic concomitant therapy additional pain control . None patient receive neither topical calcium channel blocker Botulinum toxin injection due unavailability . The primary outcome measure `` time complete cessation anal pain '' . The secondary outcome include heal chronic anal fissure define `` time complete epithelization '' . The study approve Ethics Committee First Surgical Clinic , Faculty Medicine , University Belgrade . The study perform accordance Declaration Helsinki current Good Clinical Practices . All patient give write informed consent prior participation . Physical examination detail medical history take experienced colorectal surgeon . Pain assessment quantify use visual analog scale ( VAS ) treatment postoperative outpatient visit . Bowel continence also assess use Wexner fecal incontinence score prior treatment postoperative outpatient visit . The liposuction procedure perform perform combination local anesthesia moderate sedation/general anesthesia . The mixture 180 mL saline solution , 1mL Epinephrine ( 1:10,000 ) 20 mL 2 % lidocaine inject subcutaneous layer abdominal wall allow tumescence decrease blood loss . The manual liposuction procedure carry two three small incision use Sforza harvester ( Tulip® medical product , San Diego , USA ) . Approximately 150-200 mL raw lipoaspirate obtain patient . The harvest site covered pressure dress 10 day reduce swell hematoma . The closed system PureGraft® 250mL ( PureGraft® , Solana Beach , California , USA ) use use collect specimen . The specimen transfer within 15 min BelPrime Clinic laboratory Celution® 800/CRS system ( Cytori Therapeutics , Inc. San Diego , California , USA ) apply process lipoaspirate order obtain ADRCs . The Celution® 800/CRS system close automate medical device help separate blood fat . The system digest fat use proprietary enzyme reagent Celase 835/CRS ( Cytori Therapeutics , Inc. San Diego , California , USA ) release stromal vascular fraction ( SVF ) . SVF subsequently concentrate short centrifugation automate wash cycle obtain ADRC fraction . This 90 120-minute process provide approximately 5mL pellet . A drop obtain pellet immediately use cell counting ( ChemoMetec A/S DK-3450 , Allerod , Denmark ) . The second procedure perform lithotomy position . Intravenous prophylactic antibiotic ( 1gm Metronidazol ) administer . After careful gentle anal examination , anal fissure first curetted use small size curette . The pellet divide two part . The first 2mL pellet mixed 8mL lipid part lipoaspirate purify Puregraft® 50 system . This solution ( 10mL ) inject subcutaneously edge fissure use criss-cross lattice technique Tulip® 1,2 mm injector . The rest pellet , ( approximately 2-5mL ) , infiltrate directly fissure base ( internal anal sphincter ) use 20G needle . No laxatives stool softener prescribe . Patients discharge hospital hour procedure . Patients follow weekly telephone interview first 2 month , monthly 12 month procedure . The outpatient visit schedule monthly 9 month ensure heal anal fissure . Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) score Wexner fecal incontinence score [ 31 ] also record .</detailed_description>
