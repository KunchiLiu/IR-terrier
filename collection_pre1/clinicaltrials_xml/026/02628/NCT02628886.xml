	<detailed_description>Members clinical trial team base within government run antenatal clinic clinical trial site order identify potentially eligible pregnant woman . Working closely alongside government midwifery nursing staff aim identify pregnant woman yet reach 34 week gestation thus potentially eligible enrolment . Assessment gestation first contact point base date LMP assessment fundal height local practice ( gestational age confirm ultrasound scanning inform consent obtain ultrasound base assessment use determine final eligibility ) . A member clinical trial team discus study potentially eligible expectant mother provisionally interested agree receive additional information . The discussion base content informed consent document ( ICD ) copy ICD provide expectant mother end discussion . Potentially eligible woman interest encouraged discus study spouse family member appropriate . Following individual sensitization mother , member field team may provide information family member ( particularly spouse ) either telephone visit subject 's residence accord preference mother .

In case impartial witness must present throughout element consent process must attest information ICD give accurately full . The impartial witness also require sign ICD confirm case . Informed consent study participation document signature page ICD . The option consent future use residual sample study completion also give page provision additional consent require participation main trial . A certified copy ICD provide participant unless refused reason case file trial site . Such refusal must document subject 's file clear subject offer copy The study randomize 600 pregnant woman 28 34 week gestation . Mothers replace follow randomization . Screening potentially eligible woman continue number reach unless trial stop reason . No selection assessment eligibility undertaken newborn infant . All data include safety report irrespective pregnancy outcome safety follow-up occur plan infant . An infant may exclude trial purpose vaccination and/or clinical sample ongoing participation consider best interest contraindication vaccination and/or obtain clinical sample identify . An infant exclude way would replace hence would alter target sample size 600 pregnant woman .</detailed_description>
