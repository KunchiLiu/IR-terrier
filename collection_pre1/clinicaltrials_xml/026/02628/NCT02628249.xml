	<brief_summary>Protein requirement individual participate endurance-based exercise training suggest great current recommend dietary allowance ( RDA ) . The biological value protein depend amino acid composition . As liebig 's law minimum , protein synthesis limit due lack single rate limit amino acid . In case , first rate limit amino acid determine protein intakes maximize protein synthesis . Adding small amount rate-limiting amino acid diet improve biological value protein diet . The indicator amino acid oxidation ( IAAO ) method clarify individual amino acid requirement child , normal healthy adult clinical population . however , IAAO method never utilized determine first rate limit amino acid . Therefore , purpose study address IAAO method apply determine rate-limiting amino acid endurance athlete .</brief_summary>
