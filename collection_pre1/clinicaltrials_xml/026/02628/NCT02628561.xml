	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Associate Constraint Induced Movement Therapy Over Premotor Cortex Severe Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke survivor experience one movement-related impairment activity limitation . In sense , premotor cortex ( PMC ) consider alternative locus post-stroke rehabilitation . In relation physical rehabilitation protocol , associate neuromodulation , investigator choose standardized physical therapy protocol study , Constraint Induced Movement Therapy ( CIMT ) , present evidence good therapeutic result . The investigator hypothesize apply tDCS CIMT PMC promote motor restoration stroke patient .</detailed_description>
