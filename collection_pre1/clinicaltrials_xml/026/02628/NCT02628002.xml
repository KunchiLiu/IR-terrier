	<brief_summary>This study test hypothesis anti-gravity treadmill safely use stress nuclear myocardial perfusion image patient unable perform conventional treadmill exercise . This foundational evidence consider large clinical trial show anti-gravity treadmill improve diagnostic specificity across cardiovascular stress test modality include treadmill-alone , exercise stress echocardiogram , exercise SPECT well implication cardiac PET MRI future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-gravity Treadmill Exercise Stress Myocardial Perfusion Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , single blind , control study enroll 75 subject present nuclear cardiology stress lab previously order SPECT study . Potential subject identify study staff stress lab staff prior stress portion study potential subject state inability exercise target heart rate conventional treadmill prior start exercise . The study coordinator contact obtain informed consent study subject . Subjects , sign informed consent document , enrol complete enrollment . If subject qualifies study , randomize 2:1 ratio test control arm use preprinted randomization table . Subjects randomized test arm instruct proper procedure safely enter exercise anti-gravity treadmill stress lab research staff . Subjects provide size-appropriate pair neoprene short worn clothes . The short attach anti-gravity treadmill . These short clean follow patient use . Test arm subject exercise accord Bruce protocol unweighted 75 % body weight additional unweighting 50 % test unable reach target 75 % weight . Once subject reach target heart rate Bruce protocol , patient receive Tc-99m injection per standard clinical protocol maintain target heart rate 1 minute follow injection . Patients bring walk speed recovery . Any subject test arm unable reach target heart rate anti-gravity treadmill slow walk speed receive regadenoson Tc-99m injection walk . They maintain 75 % unweighting walking injection . Subjects unable reach target anti-gravity treadmill include final data safety analysis exclude test arm image analysis . Subjects randomize control arm proceed clinical standard regadenoson pharmacological stress SPECT study adjunctive low-intensity walk conventional treadmill regadenoson Tc-99m injection tolerate . If unable tolerate treadmill exercise , receive regadenoson Tc-99m injection rest . Study patient stable systemic blood pressure reading equal great 90 mmHg systolic . Other inclusion exclusion criterion describe detail . All image acquire standard clinical imaging protocol process trained nuclear medicine technologist . The image analyzed read experience nuclear cardiologist blind whether patient anti-gravity treadmill control arm . The subsequent image value confirm separate blind experienced nuclear cardiologist . The uptake count isotope leave ventricle versus background count record compare test arm control arm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients &gt; 18 year age able ambulate . 2 . Women either negative pregnancy test , postmenopausal prior surgical infertility 3 . Nuclear stress SPECT image test order exercise SPECT regadenoson SPECT . 4 . If order exercise SPECT , selfadmission inability exercise conventional treadmill . This typically include subject unable exercise due obesity , musculoskeletal disease , peripheral vascular disease , weakness debilitation . 5 . Patients initially start conventional treadmill exercise protocol stop due exerciselimiting symptom include musculoskeletal pain fatigue . 6 . Hemodynamically stable patient define mean blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 75 mm Hg heart rate ( HR ) 60120 beat per minute . 1 . Hemodynamically unstable patient define rest mean BP &lt; 75 HR &lt; 60 &gt; 120 . 2 . Patients acute coronary syndrome define troponin elevation ( &gt; 0.05 ) within past 72 hour . 3 . Patients high clinical risk relate severe aortic stenosis , know exerciseinduced ventricular tachycardia fibrillation , advance ( seconddegree type II thirddegree ) heart block . 4 . Patients leave bundle branch block pace cardiac rhythm ( exercise associate nonischemic perfusion abnormality ) . 5 . Patients unable provide consent unable cooperate . 6 . Inability physically enter onto antigravity treadmill unit . 7 . Pregnant woman . 8 . Patients contraindication receive regadenoson ( sinus node dysfunction , highdegree heart block , active wheezing/reactive airway disease ) . 9 . At risk patient population ( prisoner severely mentally handicap ) .</criteria>
