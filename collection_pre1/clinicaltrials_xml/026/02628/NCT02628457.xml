	<brief_summary>There two purpose study , first find whether arthroscopic rotator cuff repair change appearance supraspinatus muscle atrophy every patient . Second , find much approximate change one expect depend age tendon retraction</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Did MRI Appearance Supraspinatus Muscle Atrophy Changes After Repair All Kind Rotator Cuff Tear ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retrospective review 209 patient preoperative immediate postoperative MRI do . Both preoperative immediate postoperative occupancy ratio calculate change occupancy ratio calculate every patient . Patient divide two major group accord age &lt; 60 year &gt; 60 year 3 subgroup mild , moderate severe depend preoperative supraspinatus tendon retraction coronal view MRI . Postoperative occupation ratio compare preoperative occupation ratio within subgroup change occupation ratio use comparison subgroup . Change occupation ratio also use comparison 2 major group</detailed_description>
