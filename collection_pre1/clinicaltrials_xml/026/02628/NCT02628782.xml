	<brief_title>InSeal VCD Large Bore Vascular Closure Device Safety Effectiveness Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase variety arterial device large cross profile require use large bore sheath mandate focus large bore closure . Such procedure include endovascular abdominal repair ( EVAR ) , thoracic ( TEVAR ) aortic repair transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) typically involve sheath delivery catheter 14-25Fr profile . Today , typical closing technique ( label Europe ) large sheath size one suture deploy prior insertion large sheath suture tie end procedure . This technique cumbersome , hard learn , complex use relative high complication failure rate . The InSeal VCD device easy use , fast , affords immediate reliable hemostasis , two configuration device support wide range sheath puncture size ( model 13-515 dia . 7.2-10 mm artery model 13-600 dia . 5.5-7.5 mm artery ) , leave minimal amount material behind limit re-access . While feature may find one commercial device another , date single device meet market requirement .</detailed_description>
