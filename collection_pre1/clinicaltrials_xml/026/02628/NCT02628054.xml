	<detailed_description>Elevated level pro-inflammatory cytokine implicate pathogenesis major depression . Both clinical animal study show pro-inflammatory cytokine induce behavioural repertoire symptom collectively refer 'sickness behaviour , ' include cognitive mood symptom , depression , anxiety , memory impairment , fatigue , anhedonia sleep disturbance . Raised circulate pro-inflammatory cytokine exhibit chronic medical illness , rheumatoid arthritis , frequently associate high rate co-morbid depression compare general population . Medically healthy individual major depression also show raise pro-inflammatory cytokine level . Moreover , administration interferon-α ( IFN-α ) , recombinant form inflammatory cytokine commonly use therapy hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) certain cancer , well documented precipitate depression cognitive impairment 30-50 % patient . In previous study Department investigator show , use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , IFN- α increase marker glutamate activity . This particular interest postulate role glutamate mood regulation cognition . Converging evidence link inflammation depression therefore lead hypothesis chronic low-grade inflammation could lead persistent alteration neuropsychological function might instrumental pathogenesis major depression . However , mechanisms potential modulation mood cognitive function remain unclear . In order examine relationship inflammation depression , experimental model inflammation develop involve exogenous administration cytokine cytokine-inducers , example salmonella typhi ( typhoid ) vaccination . This study utilise typhoid vaccination model acute inflammatory challenge healthy volunteer , previously show stimulate mild , non-sickness induce inflammatory response significantly increase level pro-inflammatory cytokine , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , safe manner without increase symptom illness , body temperature blood pressure . This model show elicit transient depression-like syndrome healthy volunteer , include range behavioural change cognitive dysfunction , fatigue modulation subjective rating mood . The investigator believe serve good model investigate effect immune activation sleep . Sleep electroencephalogram ( EEG ) record explore effect immune activation sleep , sleep change observe clinical depression . Healthy volunteer recruit study , investigator investigate effect inflammatory challenge participant currently inflammatory condition . The present exploratory study therefore aim enhance investigator understand intrigue link inflammation emotional dysfunction examine effect inflammatory challenge use typhoid vaccine sleep use detailed psychiatric assessment sleep EEG recording .</detailed_description>
