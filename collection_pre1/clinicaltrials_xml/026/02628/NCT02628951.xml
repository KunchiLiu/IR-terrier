	<brief_summary>Vascular endothelial growth factor express gastric cancer , expression associate aggressive clinical disease . Vascular endothelial growth factor expression note 51 % gastric cancer specimens one series ( versus expression normal epithelium superficial gastritis ) . Vascular endothelial growth factor expression resect gastric cancer associate tumor recurrence shorter survival . Maeda et al . study 95 gastric cancer patient follow resection curative intent , note significantly short survival 34 patient whose tumor endothelium express VEGF ( detect via immunohistochemistry ) versus 61 patient without endothelial VEGF expression ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Yoshikawa colleague observe similar survival difference resect gastric cancer patient base level circulate ( plasma ) VEGF time resection . Circulating VEGF significantly high gastric cancer patient versus without neoplasia . Elevated circulate VEGF also associate short survival European cohort undergo gastric cancer resection ; survival beyond 30 month 24 patient serum VEGF &gt; 533 pg/mL versus 30-month survival rate &gt; 35 % 34 patient VEGF level threshold ( p &lt; 0.0001 , log-rank test ) . Recently , Jüttner colleague note reduced survival follow R0 resection gastric cancer patient whose tumor express VEGF-C VEGF-D , robust association expression reduce survival patient whose tumor express VEGF-C VEGF-D. Investigational inhibition VEGF Receptor 2 gastric cancer xenograft ( TMK-1 cell line ) associate reduced tumor growth . DC101 therapy model associate significant reduction tumor vascularity ( measure CD-31 expression ) increase endothelial tumor apoptosis . The result REGARD RAINBOW study consistent idea tumor- related angiogenesis contributes pathophysiology gastric cancer demonstrate ability ramucirumab represent improvement care patient gastric cancer whose disease progress prior chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . The patient histologically cytologically confirm gastric carcinoma , include gastric adenocarcinoma GEJ adenocarcinoma . ( Patients adenocarcinoma distal esophagus eligible primary tumor involve GEJ . ) 2 . The patient metastatic disease locally recurrent , unresectable disease . 3 . The patient measureable evaluable disease determine standard compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) imaging . Examples evaluable , nonmeasurable disease include gastric , peritoneal , mesenteric thicken area know disease , peritoneal nodule small consider measurable Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST version 1.1 ) ( 48 ) . 4 . The patient experience disease progression treatment within 4 month last dose firstline therapy metastatic disease . Acceptable prior chemotherapy regimen protocol combination chemotherapy regimens include platinum and/or fluoropyrimidine component ( acceptable prior platinum agent cisplatin , carboplatin , oxaliplatin ; acceptable prior fluoropyrimidine agent 5FU , capecitabine , S1 ) . Regimens include third agent , anthracycline taxane , acceptable provide fluoropyrimidine and/or platinum use . Recurrence within 6 month completion adjuvant chemotherapy ( capecitabine , 5FU , TS1 ) consider firstline chemotherapy . 5 . The patient 's disease amenable potentially curative resection . 6 . The patient ≥18 year age . 7 . The patient resolution Grade ≤1 ( Grade ≤2 case neuropathy ) National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) , Version 4.03 , clinically significant toxic effect prior chemotherapy , surgery , radiotherapy , hormonal therapy ( exception alopecia ) . 8 . The patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( ECOG PS ) score 0 1 . 9 . The patient adequate hepatic function define total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL ( 25.65 µmol/L ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3.0 time upper limit normal ( ULN ; 5.0 time ULN set liver metastasis ) . 10 . The patient : cirrhosis level ChildPugh B ( bad ) cirrhosis ( degree ) history hepatic encephalopathy clinically meaningful ascites result cirrhosis . Clinically meaningful ascites define ascites cirrhosis require diuretic paracentesis . 11 . The patient adequate renal function define serum creatinine ≤1.5 time ULN , creatinine clearance ( measure via 24hour urine collection ) ≥40 mL/minute ( , serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 time ULN , 24hour urine collection calculate creatinine clearance must perform ) . 12 . The patient 's urinary protein ≤1+ dipstick routine urinalysis ( UA ; urine dipstick routine analysis ≥2+ , 24hour urine collection protein must demonstrate &lt; 1000 mg protein 24 hour allow participation protocol ) . 13 . The patient adequate hematologic function , evidence absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1000/µL , hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ( 5.58 mmol/L ) , platelets ≥100,000/µL . 14 . The patient must adequate coagulation function define international normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤1.5 partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤5 second ULN ( unless receive anticoagulation therapy ) . Patients fulldose anticoagulation must stable dose ( minimum duration 14 day ) oral anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin . If receive warfarin , patient must INR ≤3.0 active bleeding ( , bleed within 14 day prior first dose protocol therapy ) pathological condition present carry high risk bleeding ( example , tumor involve major vessel know varix ) . Patients anticoagulation therapy unresected primary tumor local tumor recurrence follow resection eligible . 15 . If patient receive prior anthracycline therapy part firstline regimen , patient able engage ordinary physical activity without significant fatigue dyspnea ( equivalent New York Heart Association Class I function ) ( 49 ) . 16 . Because teratogenicity ramucirumab know , patient , sexually active , must postmenopausal , surgically sterile , use effective contraception ( hormonal barrier method ) . 17 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior enrollment . 18 . The patient able provide inform write consent . 19 . Feasible biopsy site 1 .
