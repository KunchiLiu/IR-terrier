	<detailed_description>There strong rationale support role locus coeruleus ( LC ) responsivity acute painful stimulus regulate speed recovery surgery LC responsivity mechanistic link explain risk slow recovery weak Conditioned Pain Modulation ( CPM ) , catastrophizing cognitive style , low enzyme activity catecholamine-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) genotype . Preliminary data show feasibility perform propose study . Primary Hypothesis : An observational study pupil responses noxious stimulus show strong intra-individual reliability 8 week . Key secondary hypothesis : Compared individual homozygous val val158met site catecholamine-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) gene , homozygous meet show small pupil response noxious stimulus weak CPM .</detailed_description>
