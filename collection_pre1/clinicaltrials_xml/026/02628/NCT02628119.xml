	<detailed_description>Background : The number patient End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) require renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) form dialysis rise . Hemodialysis ( HD ) remain prevalent form RRT patient ESRD . Just United States 350,000 patient ESRD hemodialysis ( HD ) number expect increase 500,000 year 2023 . Recent data provide Saudi Centre Organ Transplantation show 13000 patient ESRD hemodialysis Kingdom Saudi Arabia ( KSA ) . This number expect rise rate 7-8 % annually reach 18000 year 2018 . Establishing viable vascular access crucial consider 'life-line ' patient . HD vascular access dysfunction huge clinical problem result significant clinical morbidity patient ESRD , cause severe economic burden health care system . In United States &lt; 50 % hemodialysis access remain patent 3 year economic burden maintain vascular access patency calculate exceed $ 1 billion annually . Arteriovenous ( A-V ) dialysis access prefer form permanent dialysis access compare central venous catheter ( CVC ) due less complication well patient outcome . Native arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) synthetic arteriovenous graft ( AVG ) two main type A-V access use HD . Despite obvious benefit many patient HD continue dialyze CVC dialysis access . One reason CVC use poor long term patency rate A-V access . AVG primary patency rate 50 % 12 month around 33 % 18 month . AVF slightly well primary patency rate around 60 percent one year 51 percent 2 year . The common cause AVF AVG dysfunction stenosis development due neointimal hyperplasia ( NIH ) within circuit lead access thrombosis . Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) current standard treatment lesion . Despite treatment choice lesion patency rate PTA continue dismal . Long-term success rate generally list either primary/unassisted rate ( patency without additional procedure ) ) secondary/assisted patency ( patency additional procedure ) . Unassisted patency rate angioplasty generally range 41 76 percent six month 31 45 percent one year . To improve primary patency intervention many strategy look . Placement cover stent time intervention use , patency rate stent placement although good PTA , still optimal . One problem poor long term outcomes successful intervention ass immediate intervention success . Successful angioplasty define Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative ( DOQI ) guideline one less 30 % residual stenosis remain end intervention . It suggest residual stenosis &gt; 30 % angioplasty adequately size fully efface angioplasty balloon stent placement consider . Unfortunately angiographic image post angioplasty correlate poorly improvement access flow arteriovenous circuit . There two main problem practice standard . First , base 2-dimensional angiographic view lesion may mislead . Secondly , assessment recoil subjective base objective data . Surveillance AV access access flow monitoring recommend identify AV access stenosis develop thrombosis . One method commonly use assess access flow ultrasound dilution technique . This performed time dialysis trained staff assess access flow . Access flow measurement usually do monthly unit access surveillance program place . It show improvement access flow intervention baseline pre intervention value predict long term outcome intervention . Although helpful , access flow perform HD unit follow day patient intervention . At time impractical bring patient back intervention lead additional cost inconvenience . As clinical benefit approach minimal . In addition many dialysis unit access flow measurement available surveillance program implement . Unfortunately true hemodialysis unit Kingdom Saudi Arabia ( KSA ) . Fortunately access flow monitoring perform intra-procedurally ultrasound dilution technique . Its benefit show small pilot study . To date randomize control trial assess benefit approach intervention base improvement access flow time intervention . The researcher hypothesize approach improve outcome intervention related access dysfunction . This may also identify right scenario stent placement may benefit thus improve outcome stent placement well . This approach also improve outcomes reduce repeat hospital visit area access flow monitoring HD unit readily available case center Kingdom Saudi Arabia . Specific Aims In randomize , control , blind trial researcher would like assess clinical utility access flow base intervention approach compare conventional approach manage dialysis arteriovenous access dysfunction . Materials Methods A . Study Design : Prospective , Randomized Controlled , single centre trial compare access flow base intervention versus conventional standard approach dialysis access dysfunction . B . Study Subjects ESRD patient HD refer access dysfunction interventional nephrology service King Faisal Specialist Hospital Research Center Riyadh , KSA . Sample Size : 116 patient require 80 % chance detecting , significance level 5 % , increase primary patency outcome measure 45 % control group 70 % experimental group 6 month mean 58 patient arm . The researcher plan enroll total 140 patient 70 group .

Researchers take risk difference effect measure . The chi-square test use assess superiority new treatment compare standard protocol . Researchers set type I error rate 5 % . Baseline comparison two group conduct use two independent sample t-test continuous data summarize mean Â± standard deviation , use chi-square test categorical data .
