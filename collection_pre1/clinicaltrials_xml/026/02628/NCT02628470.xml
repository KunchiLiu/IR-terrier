	<brief_summary>Currently , many study effect manual therapy pain , enough study know mechanism cause effect . Although research measure neuromodulators substance cervical dorsal manipulation , do healthy subject information mobilization . This work aim select sample chronic neck pain , incorporate cervical mobilization therapeutic approach compare effect techniques patient accept manipulation treatment technique ( mobilization much well tolerate ) verify liberation cortisol cause stress joint manipulation psychological stress expectation may important . The hypothesis paper cervical manipulation mobilization subject chronic neck pain increase salivary cortisol level . It also expect little increase expectation manipulate group psychological stress . It expect improvement neck disability , pain range motion intervention group immediately three group follow week exercise . The main objective study measure analyze change salivary cortisol concentration intervention three group . Secondary objective analyze change range motion disability cause neck pain neck pain level</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : Experimental study use randomize controlled trial blind evaluator three parallel group , two experimental one placebo . INTERVENTION 1 . Experimental group cervical manipulation : The patient supine without pillow physiotherapist stand ipsilateral corner hand thrust . If segment manipulate upper cervical spine , radial aspect distal phalanx index finger pulse place posterolateral aspect transverse process atlas ( In medium low segment cervical spine vertebra want make thrust ) . The thumb rest zygomatic arch finger rest back skull , leave forearm perpendicular neck . In middle low cervical spine , thumb rest angle jaw finger back neck . The contralateral hand rest contralateral side patient 's skull finger face caudally , leave ear index middle finger . To take patient end range motion add ipsilateral inclination contralateral rotation without exceed 30-40 Â° . There contralateral displacement head posteroanterior glide take patient energizing . The impulse make pure contralateral rotation . 2 . Experimental Group cervical posterior-anterior mobilization painful segment : Maitland describe patient prone forehead palm . The thumb rest articular pillar ( transverse blade ) finger around neck stabilize soft tissue . The limit pressure cause pain patient . The oscillatory motion produce arm body hand remain stable pressure distribute uniformly around patient 's neck . It important neck hand move unit . high-amplitude technique may perform raise patient 's neck pad finger This technique perform 3 minute remain pain threshold patient . 3 . Placebo group : The subject group expect cervical manipulation check psychological component effect cortisol segregation . It proceed protocol group cervical manipulation , without joint stress thrust . Participants receive protocol domiciliary cervical control exercise adapt subject deep cervical muscle take second salivary sample . Seasonal timing consider ( evaluate subject month ) , circadian rhythm ( evaluate subject mid-morning avoid peak morning cortisol ) period menstrual cycle factor determine result . In case menstrual cycle cite seventh day cycle .</detailed_description>
