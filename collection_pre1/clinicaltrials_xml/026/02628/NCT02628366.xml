	<brief_summary>People fail kidney need artificial kidney machine ( call dialysis ) remove toxins extra fluid body . Most patient receive dialysis treatment hospital three time week . During treatment , patient 's blood pressure may drop , cause dizziness muscle cramp . Repeated drop blood pressure also injure heart brain . Over time , lead heart attack , stroke , sometimes death . New research show cool temperature dialysis fluid ( call dialysate ) reduce heart brain injury . In hospital , patient ' dialysate temperature set 36.5 ºC ( match body temperature ) . In study 73 patient , show reduce dialysate temperature 0.5 ºC body temperature protect heart brain injury [ 1,2 ] . We want test simple , safe , low-cost intervention large study 7000 dialysis patient Ontario . We low dialysate temperature dialysis machine Ontario add cost . This intervention potential reduce many hospitalization death Ontario , relieve suffer patient kidney failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Statement health problem issue Dialysis life-saving treatment patient kidney failure . However , 20 % patient die within one year start dialysis heart disease stroke . One reason many dialysis patient die heart disease stroke may relate dialysis treatment . During dialysis , blood pressure often drop , flow blood oxygen heart brain reduce . Over time , cause significant damage result heart attack , stroke , even death . Our team first show heart brain become starved blood oxygen dialysis . We others show lowering temperature dialysis ( patient 's body temperature ) improve blood flow protects heart brain dialysis . We determine method prevent heart attack stroke large population dialysis patient . 2 . Objective project Our study determine whether cooler , personalize dialysis temperature prevent heart attack , stroke , death . 3 . How undertake work ? We conduct randomize controlled trial . Our study include 7500 dialysis patient 82 dialysis centre across Ontario . The name study MY TEMP . Patients treatment group receive cooler dialysis ( 0.5ºC measure body temperature ) . Patients control group receive standard dialysis fix temperature 36.5ºC . This study last two year . At end two year , compare number heart attack , stroke deaths treatment control group . 4 . What unique/innovative project ? We usually need study large number patient clinical trial reliably understand effect treatment . Normally , study 7500 patient would cost $ 15 million dollar conduct ; however , study provide reliable answer question ask cost less $ 2 million . This use data already collect healthcare system . For example , patient hospitalize heart attack stroke , information record secure healthcare database . We able analyze healthcare data end study ( link patient outcome type dialysis treatment receive ( i.e . treatment control ) ) . This innovative study design mean study much large ( cost less ) traditional clinical trial . In addition , MY TEMP simple safe intervention provide dialysis machine add cost . If proven effective , simple , low-cost intervention could easily adopt across Canada ( worldwide ) , save healthcare system million dollar reduce number hospitalization heart attack stroke . 5 . What impact propose research ? Each year Ontario , 2,000 hemodialysis patient die hospitalized major cardiovascular event . Heart disease stroke leading cause death dialysis patient . Unfortunately , medication prevent heart disease stroke patient work well dialysis patient . If intervention successful , think prevent least 200 death cardiovascular event year ( Ontario alone ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This pragmatic cluster randomize control trial two inclusion criterion : The medical director dialysis centre must provide informed consent willing transition patient receive temperaturereduced personalized hemodialysis ( randomize intervention ) stay standard 36.5°C hemodialysis temperature course trial ( randomize control group ) ; The centre must care minimum 15 patient treated conventional incentre hemodialysis three time per week . The centre care less 15 patient treated conventional incentre hemodialysis three time per week .</criteria>
