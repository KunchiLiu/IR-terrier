	<brief_title>Microvascular Dysfunction Development Whole-body Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In today 's society , food availability grossly exceed body 's caloric demand . Excessive caloric intake cause weight gain induces insulin resistance , common characteristic obesity major risk factor type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) cardiovascular disease . The primary target insulin action skeletal muscle , adipose tissue liver , recent data point vascular endothelium important target . Insulin directly target endothelial cell activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase , result Akt-mediated phosphorylation endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) . This lead NO production - potent vasodilator human body . Simultaneously insulin also activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway endothelial cell , enhances generation vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signal . Via two pathway insulin regulate vascular tone . In healthy individual , insulin signal endothelial cell lead capillary recruitment skeletal muscle tissue via vasodilatation terminal arteriole . It propose insulin matter regulate delivery insulin glucose skeletal muscle increase endothelial surface area . In obese individual patient T2DM , insulin-mediated capillary recruitment skeletal muscle tissue impair insulin-dependent glucose uptake diminish . Whether two process link occur parallel remain unknown . Interestingly , study rodent demonstrate obesity induce high fat feeding , insulin resistance develop vasculature response detect muscle , liver , adipose tissue . Therefore , insulin signal endothelium might change response positive energy balance prevent nutrient overload muscle optimize nutrient storage adipose tissue . Conversely , hypothesize early reversal endothelial insulin resistance could prevent peripheral insulin resistance , assume cause-and-effect relationship process . The compelling evidence hypothesis come study endothelial cell specific insulin receptor substrate-2 ( IRS-2 ) knock-out mouse . Kubota et al . demonstrate impaired insulin signal endothelial cell , due reduce IRS-2 expression insulin-induced eNOS phosphorylation , cause attenuation insulin-induced capillary recruitment insulin delivery , reduce glucose uptake skeletal muscle . Moreover , restoration insulin-induced eNOS phosphorylation endothelial cell infusion beraprost sodium - stable prostaglandin analogue - completely reverse reduction capillary recruitment insulin delivery tissue-specific knockout mouse lack IRS-2 endothelial cell feed high-fat diet . As result , glucose uptake skeletal muscle restore mouse . These data suggest pharmacological stimulation tissue perfusion may hold promise therapeutic strategy increase whole body glucose disposal thus prevent reduce hyperglycaemia . In human however , data link improvement capillary recruitment pharmacological agent restoration whole-body glucose uptake lacking . Low dose iloprost infusion - another stable prostaglandin analogue - show improve insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose uptake , mechanistic role microvascular response assess . Overall , remain demonstrated whether improve capillary recruitment endothelial insulin signal direct stimulation smooth muscle tissue may serve attractive preventive therapeutic approach bypass cellular resistance glucose disposal . In conclusion , vascular insulin resistance lead blunt capillary recruitment skeletal muscle may lead diminish glucose uptake due decrease capillary surface area nutrient exchange . Up till however remain unclear process interrelate occur parallel . Evidence animal study suggest vascular insulin resistance precedes diminish whole-body glucose uptake myocellular impairment . This indicate potential cause-effect relationship . In human , however , never demonstrate . On hand , decrease capillary recruitment skeletal muscle tissue could also protect muscle tissue nutrient overload shunt excess calorie towards adipose tissue . Presently , unknown whether insulin redistributes blood flow skeletal muscle adipose tissue hypercaloric condition . Finally , unknown stimulation tissue perfusion pharmacological agent restore whole-body glucose uptake therefore effective strategy prevention treatment insulin resistance .</detailed_description>
