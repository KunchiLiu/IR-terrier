	<brief_title>Impact Cashew Nuts Human Diet : Measured Energy Value Effects Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cardioprotective effect nuts well document scientific literature ; however , research do almonds , walnut , pistachio , study cashew nut lack . In addition cardiovascular literature , recent study measure metabolizable energy nut demonstrate measure energy value almonds , pistachio , walnut lower predict use Atwater factor . However , measure energy value cashew nut unknown . There two distinct aim study - determine effect cashew nut consumption risk factor CVD , determine energy value cashew nut human diet . The cardiovascular effect cashew nut determine measure traditional emerge risk factor . The metabolizable energy value cashew nut calculate base chemical composition energy content consume diet excreta . This provide good estimate energy value simply calculate energy value base Atwater factor .</detailed_description>
