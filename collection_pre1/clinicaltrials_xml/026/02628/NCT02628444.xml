	<brief_summary>The aim study assess safety primary series vaccine schedule booster vaccination Primary Objectives : - To demonstrate non-inferiority immune response elicit dengue serotype tetravalent CYD vaccine give 2 dose schedule ( Placebo 1/CYD Dengue vaccine group ) compare immune response elicit CYD vaccine give 3 dose schedule ( CYD Dengue vaccine group ) 28 day post-final vaccination . - To demonstrate non-inferiority immune response elicit dengue serotype tetravalent CYD vaccine give 1 dose schedule ( Placebo 2/CYD Dengue vaccine group ) compare immune response elicit CYD vaccine give 3 dose schedule ( CYD Dengue vaccine group ) 28 day post final vaccination . - To demonstrate non-inferiority immune response elicit dengue serotype 28 day administration single booster dose tetravalent CYD vaccine Secondary Objectives : - To demonstrate superiority immune response elicit tetravalent CYD vaccine give 2 dose schedule ( Placebo 1/CYD Dengue vaccine group ) compare immune response elicit CYD vaccine give 3 dose schedule ( CYD Dengue vaccine group ) 28 day post-final vaccination . - To demonstrate superiority immune response elicit tetravalent CYD vaccine give 1 dose schedule ( Placebo 2/CYD Dengue vaccine group ) compare immune response elicit CYD vaccine give 3 dose schedule ( CYD Dengue vaccine group ) 28 day post-final vaccination . - To describe neutralize antibody level dengue serotype 28 day post Dose 3 Ab level immediately receive booster injection 3 CYD vaccination group . - To describe neutralize antibody level dengue serotype 28 day post-dose 2 28 day post-dose 3 CYD Dengue vaccine group primary series schedule . - To demonstrate superiority immune response elicit dengue serotype 28 day administration single booster dose tetravalent CYD vaccine . - To evaluate safety profile CYD vaccine injection</brief_summary>
