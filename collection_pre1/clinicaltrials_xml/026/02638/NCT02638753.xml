	<detailed_description>Introduction : Education pain neurophysiology beneficial effect disability psychosocial aspect patient non specific chronic low back pain . However , education limit effect pain . Hypnosis approach proven efficient pain intensity psychosocial aspect chronic pain condition , insufficient evidence contribution patient non specific chronic low back pain . Objectives : The aim study assess efficacy combine education neurophysiology pain hypnosis patient non specific chronic low back pain pain disability outcomes . Study design : randomize control trial two arm blind evaluator . Local study : Interventions hold Universidade Cidade de Sao Paulo ( UNICID ) . Participants : One hundred patient chronic non specific low back pain wait list physical therapy care UNICID physical therapy clinic , interested eligible study invite participate . Intervention : Patients randomized education group pain neurophysiology group combine education hypnosis . Measurements : Clinical outcome obtain 2 week 3 month randomization . The primary outcome pain intensity ( measured numerical pain scale ) general disability ( measure Roland-Morris questionnaire ) . The secondary outcome catastrophic thought ( measure PCS-Brazil ) , specific disability ( measure Patient-specific function scale ) global perceive effect ( measure Global Perceived Effect scale ) . Limitations : Both therapist patient blind intervention provide . Hypothesis : This first study provide result achieved education pain neurophysiology use hypnosis patient chronic non specific low back pain .</detailed_description>
