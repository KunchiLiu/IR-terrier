	<brief_summary>Background : Headaches common presentation child consult Emergency Department ( ED ) . However , study evaluate rapid pain improvement provide medication acute management headache pediatric population . Objective : To evaluate pain reduction provide intranasal fentanyl ( INF ) compare placebo addition ibuprofen child present pediatric ED moderate severe headache . Methods : A single-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo control clinical trial conduct urban , university-affiliated , tertiary care pediatric hospital ED . All child eight 18 year old present ED headache main chief complaint pain ≥ 36 mm 100 Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) recruit . Study participant randomly allocate receive INF 1.5 mcg/kg ( maximum dose 100 mcg ) similar volume placebo solution via atomizer . Co-administration oral ibuprofen 10 mg/kg ( maximum dose 600 mg ) also provide two group receive previous 4 hour . The primary outcome mean pain rating reduction 15 minute . The secondary outcome mean pain reduction 30 60 minute , patient 's parental satisfaction level , percent pain free , sedation score , immediate within 72 hour adverse event , additional ED analgesic medication , length ED stay , disposition outcome , hospital admission rate ED revisit rate within 72 hour . The primary analysis use intention-to-treat approach compare mean pain score reduction two group use Student 's T-test . The sample size 60 participant per arm calculate power 80 % identify difference 10 mm VAS . Expected result : Our study might demonstrate INF provide additional pain relief child present ED headache . Providing INF could relieve symptom quickly , potentially improve patient 's family 's satisfaction , possibly reduce length ED stay consequently , significant impact patient quality care cost-effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT Evaluating Intranasal Fentanyl Pain Management Children With Headaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective present study would determine additive value analgesic effectiveness INF child age eight 18 year acute moderate severe headache . We would also aim gather information safety acceptability INF headache . We believe provide INF moderate severe headache decrease pain level child age 8 18 year old . We perform prospective , double-blind , randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial . The study set single center , urban , university-based , tertiary care pediatric university-affiliated hospital ED annual census 75,000 patient visit . The study conduct 2015-2018 . Study population : Inclusion criterion consist child age eight 18 year present pediatric ED chief complaint headache , regardless type , moderate severe pain score . Pain consider least moderate superior equal 36 mm VAS demonstrate Hirschfeld et . Al . This level choose recognize adequate sensitivity analgesia trial acute pain obtained patient experience least moderate pain administration treatment . Intervention : All patient receive 1.5 mcg⁄kg dose fentanyl equivalent volume similar look placebo . This administer intranasally via mucosal atomiser device ( MAD ) use 50 mcg/mL solution 2 mL syringe . Prior study show dose effective IV IM morphine provide bioavailability 71 % IV dose . The minimum dose prescribe 20 mcg , ensure delivery 15 mcg fentanyl 10 kg child , allow MAD dead space 0.1 mL ( 5 mcg fentanyl ) . For analgesic dose-volumes equal less 0.5 mL , entire dose administer one nostril ; dose 0.5 mL divide equally administer nostril . Concentrated medication small volume ( 0.2-0.3 mL per nostril ) ideal , whereas volume excess 1 mL per nostril reliably absorb result mucosal surface saturation runoff nasal cavity . The maximum dose administer 100 mcg due volume constraint . The placebo solution consist normal saline would deliver via propose atomiser . The value administer adjusted patient weight active study medication . No additional dose either study medication would provide . A MAD chosen suggest increase mucosal coverage absorption medication atomize particle decrease amount medication lose due swallowing . Oral ibuprofen ( 10 mg/kg ) ( maximum dose 600 mg ) also administer within first 15 minute intranasal administration study medication unless give previous 4 hour . It choose acetaminophen direct comparison show complete pain relief two hour achieve twice frequently ibuprofen . The randomization process occur local pharmacy randomization allotment know pharmacist involve study . Therefore , provider involve patient 's care patient blind group assignment data analysis completion . The participant randomly assign one two group follow : 1 ) INF 1.5 mcg/kg 2 ) placebo solution , give via atomizer ( MAD device : MAD Nasal , U.S. Patent # 6,112,743 , Wolfe-Tory Medical , Inc. , 79 West 4500 South , Salt Lake City , Utah 84107 ) . The study medication provide ED local pharmacy . For randomized patient , consecutive study medication package open ED . Each study package contain study medication ( either generic fentanyl bottle saline bottle ) , syringe atomizer delivery . An on-site nurse withdraw study medication specific bottle provide package deliver study medication patient . The study research assistant remain blind . At pharmacy , patient 's identification cod user access code able identify participant . Procedure : Every patient weigh triage . Enrollment limit time research assistant available . A research assistant recruit patient pediatric ED physician assess symptom headache clearly establish . The pain associated headache assess use VAS , validate use child age eight year old across variety clinical setting excellent interrater-reliability validity analgesia research . Once eligibility exclusion criterion confirm , caregiver give write verbal study information . Written consent enrolment gain accompany parent child , appropriate . The research assistant use timer coordinate event . At baseline , intervention , VAS score , baseline vital sign sedation score ( UMSS ) record research assistant . For assessment VAS score , child ask mark standardize data collection booklet , level pain 100-mm non hatch VAS scale one end `` pain '' `` bad pain ever '' follow , verbatim : `` Show line level pain : pain ; worst possible pain . '' The patient cross line indicate level pain . All measurement record close 1 mm . At time zero , solution contain syringe administer on-site nurse anterior aspect participant 's nasal cavity second . The dose ( half , necessary ) administer one patient 's nostrils MAD . The second half dose , need , administered contralateral nostril use MAD . Younger child medication administer sit lap parent , head recline neck hyperextend . Older child receive medication lie semi recumbent position gurney . No additional dose would provide . The research assistant remain blinded medication patient receive . At fifteenth , thirtieth sixtieth minute post-intervention , research assistant obtain pain score via VAS patient ask change pain . They ask give verbal rating pain ' lot less ' , ' little less ' , 'the ' , ' little ' ' lot ' compare initial baseline , time zero reassess level pain VAS use previously . Children permit refer previous scale marking remain blinded prior score . The sedation score also record use University Michigan Sedation Scale ( UMSS ) overall validity demonstrate declared simple , valid reliable tool facilitates rapid frequent assessment documentation depth sedation child . The vital sign also take interval . A detailed demographic clinical data also collect study medication administration . A standardized questionnaire patient 's present past headache , complete research assistant stay pediatric ED . The questionnaire include question duration , location , description pain , associate symptom present headache past medical history . No med , IV fluid , IV procedures painful procedure do study period unless patient 's condition change deteriorates . If procedure need study period , patient withdrawn study treat accord state health . At sixtieth minute study , mark end study , patient assent study parent ask rate satisfaction efficacy study medication Likert scale ( 'strongly disagree ' 'disagree ' , 'neither agree disagree ' , 'agree ' , 'strongly agree ' ) . This satisfaction scale give patient parent last pain score obtain . The study would complete , care discretion attend pediatric ED medical staff . A follow-up call research assistant do 72 hour discharge assess headache recurrence , late medication side effect , return another medical facility . All child hospitalize also reach . A chart review do member research team collect final pediatric ED diagnosis well additional investigation ( e.g . CT scan , consultation neurologist , blood test , TSH , etc. ) . Data collect use pediatric ED medical record recruit patient sociodemographic questionnaire complete research assistant . The result variable : VAS , UMSS satisfaction score collect real time research assistant pediatric ED stay . A data collection form use , form later cross-referenced patient 's clinical record member research team verify correct documentation eligibility . Sample size statistic : This first study evaluate pain related type headache child . Accordingly , previous study perfectly match design infer sample size . However , two previous study evaluate intervention provide decrease acute pain secondary migraine child use VAS . These study report standard deviation 18.5 20 mm . Powell et al find minimum clinically significant difference ( MCSD ) VAS pain score child age 8 15 year ( 100-mm VAS scale ) 10 mm ( 95 % confidence interval 7 12 mm ) . In study population , difference less amount , even statistically significant , unlikely clinical significance . Previous research adult find MCSD VAS pain score differ adult age , sex , cause pain . Based data , use alpha value 0,05 power 80 % , estimate need , 57 patient per group . Accounting maximal 5 % drop-off rate , inflate number 60 participant per group . All data enter excel database ( Microsoft Inc. , Richmond , WA ) analyze SPSS v21 ( IBM Inc ) . The primary study analysis Student 's T-test compare mean difference score intervention group placebo group . An intention-to-treat approach use . Also , secondary analysis perform use Student 's T-test continuous variable Pearson Chi-square test categorical variable . The 95 % confidence interval measure result .</detailed_description>
