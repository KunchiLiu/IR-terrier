	<brief_summary>The current treatment regimen patient septic shock require sufficient hemodynamic support aim preserve tissue oxygen requirement perfusion . Therefore , aggressive fluid challenge vasopressor agent play pivotal role . To increase total peripheral resistance preserve organ perfusion , continuous infusion catecholamine often need . Because sepsis usually associate adrenergic receptor post-receptor abnormality , efficacy treatment regimen often gradually decrease time , thereby complicate hemodynamic support . Experimental evidence suggest α-2 agonist increase pressor responsiveness follow lipopolysaccharide administration . This study assess effect sedation dexmedetomidine ( α-2 agonist ) norepinephrine requirement patient septic shock .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Effects Dexmedetomidine Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study design prospective study . All patient enrol study require norepinephrine maintain MAP 65 75 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation sedate accord istitutional guideline propofol remifentanyl . After 8 h elapse stable hemodynamic condition , initial set measurement obtain sedation propofol remifentanyl . This set measurement consider baseline . In patient conventional sedation replace dexmedetomidine remifentanyl , second set measurement obtain 4 h elapse stable condition . A final set mesurements obtain another 8-h period stable condition switcheing back propofol remifentanyl , . During observational period dosage rate norepinephrine adjust maintain threshold MAP 65-75 mmHg All medication hold constant .</detailed_description>
