	<brief_title>Therapy With Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir Patients With Genotype 1 HCV Infection Receiving Opiate Substitution Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients active previous i.v.-drug abuse patient receive opiate substitution therapy ( OST ) represent major subgroup patient chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) . Till year ago hold , patient history i.v.-drug abuse patient receive OST consider interferon-based antiviral treatment poor compliance . However , past year become clear , patient OST consider stable physician good candidate antiviral therapy . Several study show SVR ( sustained virological response rate ) achieve patient similar result patient without history i.v . drug abuse . Subgroups patient receive OST : Patients receive OST represent heterogeneous population . However , base empirical observation behavior/compliance individual patient assign one follow three group : Group 1 : Patients good compliance . These patient take drug anymore demonstrate good compliance . If anti HCV therapy indicate , patient refer treated hepatologic Center ( i.e . hospital ) . Such patient include various phase III trials new direct act antiviral agent ( DAAs ) . Group 2 : Patients poor compliance . These patient keep appointment ( regardless whether low threshold facility hospital ) . Due lack compliance antiviral therapy patient feasible . Group 3 : Patients borderline compliance . These patient come low threshold facility daily basis get OST direct observation physician nurse . These patient reluctant go specialized hepatitis center ( high inhibition threshold ) hence treat . However , anti-HCV treatment apply together OST direct observation physician nurse low threshold facility . The `` Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien '' `` low threshold facility '' ( LTF ) : The `` Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien '' facility offer medical care patient active former i.v . drug abuse ( = ( ex- ) PWIDs ) . The medical team low-threshold facility ( =LTFs ) include general practitioner , specialist internal medicine , psychiatrists nurse . In contrast hospital ( hepatologic center Austria outpatient clinic large hospital ) , relatively high `` psychological '' inhibition threshold PWIDs CHC , LTFs locate `` normal '' house . The set `` psychological '' inhibition threshold PWIDs go low . At LTFs ( ex- ) PWIDs obtain OST daily basis direct observation physician nurse . Hence , patient high motivation come facility daily ( avoid withdrawal symptom - similar incentive/interest/motivation go hospital regular basis ) . The direct observe OST prevents potential selling medication black market . Anti-HCV treatment `` Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien '' : Univ.-Prof. Dr. Michael Gschwantler , experience hepatologist cooperate `` Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien '' ( =LTF ) . He visit facility least week ( immediately case serious problem ) take care patient regard hepatitis/liver disease . Prof. Gschwantler voluntarily unsalaried . He perform routine laboratory sonographic evaluation liver directly LTF . Prof. Gschwantler already treat small number eligible `` group 3 patient '' ( patient borderline compliance describe ) interferon-based treatment directly LTF ( patient n't need go hospital ) . However , beside compliance issue contraindication interferon ( e.g . due depression ) prevent many ( ex- ) PWIDs treat moment . Study drug : In non-interventional study patient chronic hepatitis C , genotype 1 , treat Harvoni® ( Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir ) . Harvoni® approve treatment chronic hepatitis C. For treatment-naïve patient genotype 1 infection without liver cirrhosis recommend duration treatment 8 week . In non-interventional study treatment Harvoni® perform exactly accord label . The study drug kindly provide Gilead .</detailed_description>
