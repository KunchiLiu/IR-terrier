	<brief_summary>Current management strategy severe recurrent epistaxis secondary Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) include surgical procedure , uncomfortable nasal packing , often short-term solution . Floseal® may provide non-invasive less painful treatment option epistaxis HHT patient . This hemostatic agent show effective intraoperative hemostatic agent number surgical procedure include endoscopic sinus surgery . It also show favorable nasal pack control acute anterior epistaxis . Though efficacy use Floseal® epistaxis HHT patient proven anecdotally literature yet prove prospective clinical trial . The result pilot study provide insight efficacy use Floseal® management severe epistaxis HHT patient assist development full-scale prospective clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Pilot Study Floseal Treatment Anterior Epistaxis Patients With ( HHT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) , also know Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome , autosomal dominant disorder characterize abnormal blood vessel development . This dysplasia manifest mucocutaneous telangiectases visceral arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) . The common symptom epistaxis occur secondary telangiectases nasal mucosa 90 % HHT patient . Heterogeneity exist severity epistaxis experience HHT patient ; therefore , treatment management strategy vary . For minor bleeding , conservative management may include prevent dry nasal mucosa use ointment humidification . In case , topical systemic estrogen may also use improve stability nasal mucosa , thereby reduce bleed . Commonly , anterior nasal pack use non-surgical management strategy control major bleeding . When medical management strategy fail , laser coagulation telangiectases septodermoplasty may consider however , solution temporary telangiectasia know recur . In acute setting , embolization may use occlude abnormal vasculature maintain blood flow surround tissue ; however , also effective long-term solution . Severe difficult manage epistaxis effectively treat use modified Young 's procedure closure nostril achieve suture together circumferential skin mucosa flap . Floseal hemostatic matrix ( Floseal® ) hemostatic agent consist two major component . The first gelatin granule swell come contact blood wet surface create tamponade effect . The second high concentration human thrombin promote natural clot formation convert fibrinogen fibrin . Floseal® hydrophilic therefore adheres well wet tissue . It indicate use adjunct surgical hemostat recently demonstrate effective treatment epistaxis . A prospective , randomize , control trial compare Floseal® nasal pack treatment acute anterior epistaxis . The result show Floseal® well initially control epistaxis result few rebleed event within seven day follow-up period . Patients also report less pain great overall satisfaction Floseal® compare nasal pack . Similarly , two prospective study evaluate use Floseal® treatment posterior epistaxis . These trial also show Floseal® treatment effective treatment posterior epistaxis . Furthermore , use Floseal® associate substantial institutional cost saving . In summary , Floseal® demonstrate effective treatment posterior epistaxis , regardless origin within nose . Recently , Floseal® use patient HHT . This case series show patient anterior epistaxis due HHT could self-administer Floseal® treat recurrent anterior epistaxis home without contact medical system , would customarily occur . This directly lead improvement quality life patient study . Impairment quality life patient HHT significant concern . Compared normative population , subscales SF36 , bodily pain , show significantly poor HHT patient . Studies HHT substantiate disease severity associate poor QoL patient . Treatments epistaxis improve quality life patient HHT need .</detailed_description>
