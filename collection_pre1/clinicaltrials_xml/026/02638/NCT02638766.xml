	<brief_title>Single Agent Regorafenib First-line Metastatic/Unresectable KIT/PDGFR Wild Type GIST</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SDH complex involve mitochondrial Krebs cycle defect succinate dehydrogenase ( SDH ) complex identify , previously mention , KIT/PDGFR WT . This complex , SDH , 4 subunit ( A-D ) SDH-A SDH-B involved oxidization succinate fumarate . Therefore , loss function owe mutational inactivation lead cytoplasmic accumulation succinate downregulates prolyl hydroxylase . This enzyme negative regulator role hypoxia-inducible factor 1α ( HIF1α ) since promotes proteasomal degradation . Increased level HIF1α enter nucleus activate transcription vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGFR ) 24 . In fact , VEGFR expression high KIT/PDGFR WT KIT mutant GISTs25 . Approximately 50 % KIT/PDGFR WT show high expression insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGFR1 ) . This expression may correlate also loss SDH due IGF autocrine loop26 . IGFR signal MAPK PI3K-AKT pathway . As previously mention , Regorafenib able block MAPK signal pathway different level . Interestingly , early interstitial Cajal cell ( ICC ) progenitor phenotype KITlowCD44+CD34+IGFR+ commit lineage progenitor KIThighCD44+CD34-IGFR- . Unlike mature commit lineage ICCs , KITlowCD44+CD34+IGFR+ display resistance Imatinib spite kit signal pathway activation . Thus Regorafenib could gain advantage Imatinib treat KIT/PDGFR WT27,28 . On hand , subset within KIT/PDGFR WT B-RAF mutant NF1-associated GIST could also sensitive Regorafenib . In late subset , protein expression phospho-MAPK see 92 % case series 25 patients29 . Theoretically Regorafenib could also act block STAT3 , activate RET proto-oncogen , RET inhibition . STAT3 implicate downstream pathway signal GIST30 . Taken together , previous data suggests Regorafenib could play relevant role upfront treatment metastatic unresectable locally advanced KIT/PDGFR WT GIST .</detailed_description>
