	<brief_title>HP Xenon-129 fMRI Healthy Volunteers Participants With Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The described study pilot study investigator aim develop enhanced sensitivity tool assessment neural function . Participation involve least two study visit longer three hour length . During visit 1 , inform consent screen eligibility take place . During visit 2 , fMRI scan take place participant complete simple task . Two type MRI scan perform : traditional proton fMRI hyperpolarized xenon-129 fMRI ( HP 129Xe fMRI ) scan . The trade name xenon-129 hyperpolarized Xemed LLC polarizer NeuroXene . Participants place 3T MRI Thunder Bay Regional Research Institute Clinical MR Solutions ( CMRS ) Dual Brain Coil fit head like helmet . Several inhalation procedure perform participant breathe NeuroXene tube scanner . Preparation administration NeuroXene CMRS Dual Brain Coil carry accord SOP 's developed TBRRI Xemed LLC . MRI scan perform MR Tech Registered Respiratory Therapist present . Dispensing 129Xe monitor use gas dispense form drug accountability log . This study monitor assign TBRRI involve clinical trial . This ensure participant safety adherence protocol .</detailed_description>
