	<detailed_description>Periodontal disease chronic inflammatory process accompany destruction Periodontium , sometimes loss teeth . Periodontal disease highly prevalent especially develop underdeveloped country affect 80 % population . Epidemiological study show 10 % adult population suffer severe periodontitis ( Brown et al . 1990 , Gjermo 1998 ) . Studies indicate periodontal lesion strictly localize process may lead systemic alteration immune system . Various study confirm microbial etiology periodontal disease . The bacteria cause periodontitis include mainly diversity anerobic bacteria ; Porphyromonas Gingivalis , Fusobacterium Nucleatum , Peptostreptococcus , Prevotella species significant . Various therapeutic approach available treatment disease utilize non surgical surgical method , treatment still challenge clinician cumbersome patient . In many case moderate severe chronic periodontitis anti- inflammatory antibiotic use adjunct . Systemic antibiotic agent may reduce eliminate microbe remove Scaling Root Planing . This include microbe penetrate tissue root surface may act reservoir recolonization . However synthetic antibiotic anti-inflammatory agent result complication like drug resistance , gastrointestinal complication , congestive heart failures renal failure complication . Especially India Mustard Oil Salt long use gum massage maintenance improvement Oral Hygiene . As practice use homemade formulation beneficial Gingival Periodontal health , economic free major side effect study document efficacy adjunct Scaling Root Planing . Mustard oil consider low saturate fat . The monounsaturated fatty acid proper ratio polyunsaturated fatty acid improve heart health , lower triglyceride , prevents obesity . Massage mustard oil relief rheumatism arthritis , sprain ache . The selenium present oil reduces effect asthma joint pain . High level Vit . E improve skin health impart protection UV ray .
