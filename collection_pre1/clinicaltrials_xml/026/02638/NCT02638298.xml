	<brief_summary>This study compare two method dress post operative wound currently practice . One method traditional dry gauze dress . The method use negative pressure dress provide gentle suction wound . The investigator attempt determine well use post-operative negative pressure dress reduces wound heal problem patient surgery radiation sarcoma thigh leg .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Preoperatively Irradiated Lower Extremity Soft Tissue Sarcoma Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative surgical site infection pose significant challenge orthopaedic oncologist , especially wound previously irradiate neo adjuvant external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) . There many study demonstrate relatively high risk wound complication low extremity sarcoma resection . Published data suggest preoperatively radiate wound postoperative infection rate 17 % -44 % `` traditional '' dressing ( e.g . dry gauze surgical dressing ) . A prospective series 190 patient show wound complication risk 35 % preoperative irradiated wound . The morbidity associate wound complication range moderate ( prolonged dressing change ) severe ( life limb threaten infection ) . Patients develop wound complication show long hospitalization higher cost [ ref ] . Anatomic location tumor show risk factor development wound complication low extremity higher risk upper extremity . There several publish study examine effect negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) high risk surgical wound . Abdominal wound complication reduce use incisional NPWT . In orthopaedic literature use negative pressure incisional dressing show low risk wound complication total hip arthroplasty , acetabular fracture , extremity fracture . To knowledge , publish study utility negative pressure wound therapy previously irradiate soft tissue sarcoma wound . The investigator feel high risk patient cohort could potentially benefit reduce wound complication NPWT ideal population study effect .</detailed_description>
