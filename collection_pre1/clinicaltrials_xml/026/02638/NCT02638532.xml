	<brief_title>Volumetric Analysis Autologous Fat Grafting Foot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study goal utilize MRI understand change occur foot autologous fat use treat plantar fat pad atrophy foot . The etiology fat pad atrophy may age-related , due abnormal foot mechanic , obesity , steroid use , collagen vascular disease . Displacement atrophy fat pad lead osseous prominence foot may see painful skin lesion . Disease state , diabetes , may loss soft tissue integrity . Fat pad atrophy may result significant pain compensatory gait lead callous formation ulceration . In sensate patient , pain lead emotional physical pain , lead productivity financial loss . Fat graft foot cosmetic surgery option . Although fat graft use often standard care plastic surgery , cosmetic reason , consider part research trial . What happen fat injection well study . Approximately 50 adult experience pain fat pad atrophy , either fore foot heel fat pad grafting . The study utilize MRI 6 month post-procedure ass change quality bone foot well 3D morphology fat . Specifically , investigator want know fat redistributes around bone . In addition , Adipose Stem Cell Biology Laboratory assess stem cell characteristic fat use autotransplantation . This study help build new collaborative effort Foot Ankle Specialists , Stem Cell Biologists , Plastic Surgeons , combine expertise foot biomechanics reconstructive fat grafting .</detailed_description>
