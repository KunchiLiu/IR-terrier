	<brief_title>Does Fluid Replacement From Preoperative NPO Status Improve Postoperative Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip knee arthroplasty safe reliable surgery majority patient , small percentage experience major complication myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . As complication related local tissue hypoxemia patient immobility , intervention improve ability heart deliver blood tissue help patient mobilize earlier postoperative course may decrease complication . Based recent evidence , show many patient dehydrate surgery , make feel nauseous , tired , increase perception pain make less likely mobilize . This predispose DVTs , pulmonary embolism , nausea vomit . Peri-operative dehydration also decrease ability lung oxygenate blood properly place additional stress heart , increase risk heart attack . The specific aim determine patient ' peri-operative hemodynamics improve preoperative administration 2 L lactate ringer , consequently reduce postoperative complication improve recovery arthroplasty patient .</detailed_description>
