	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) functional bowel disorder recurrent abdominal pain disorder defecation one common gastrointestinal problem . In practice , IBS frequently diagnose exclusion diagnosis patient recurrent abdominal pain without organic cause . Visceral hypersensitivity major contribute factor abdominal pain IBS . Accordingly , tricyclic antidepressant ( TCAs ) widely use IBS , especially abdominal pain prominent symptom . Indeed , meta-analysis also exhibit clinically significant efficacy low dose TCAs IBS . Nevertheless , 40 % IBS patient receive TCAs improvement symptom treatment . Theoretically , TCAs use IBS patient hypersensitivity , efficacy could increase . Although rectal distension test might use identify hypersensitive patient IBS , use clinical research painful patient . On contrary , colonoscopy frequently perform IBS patient rule organic disease purpose colorectal cancer screen . In study Kim colleague , IBS patient report high pain score colonoscopy non-IBS patient . This prompt hypothesis pain score during/after colonoscopy could also segregate IBS patient visceral hypersensitivity show well treatment response TCA without . The aims present study evaluate colonoscopy-related pain perception treatment response amitriptyline IBS patient investigate predictive value colonoscopy-related pain scale identify IBS patient response amitriptyline treatment .</brief_summary>
