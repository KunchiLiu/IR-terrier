	<brief_summary>The available data indicate Ceritinib substantial anti-tumor activity patient anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) ROS1 rearrange non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . This trial investigate potential Ceritinib patient advance gastrointestinal malignancy ALK ROA1 rearrangement , available therapeutic option .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Oral Ceritinib Patients With ALK ROS1 Activated Gastrointestinal Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open-label , multicenter , phase II study ceritinib adult patient ALK- ROS1 activate colorectal , cholangiocarcinoma , pancreatic , hepatic , gastric , esophageal adenocarcinoma . An estimated 500 patient screen ALK ROS1 fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) per institutional standard care ( SOC ) , and/or ALK/ROS1 next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) . At least 30 identified patient treat ceritinib per protocol . Treatment ceritinib continue patient experience unacceptable toxicity precludes treatment , discontinue treatment discretion investigator patient , start new anticancer therapy and/or dy . Male female patient age 18 colorectal adenocarcinoma , cholangiocarcinoma , pancreatic , hepatocellular , gastric esophageal adenocarcinoma contain activate ALK gene due rearrangement , mutation , amplification , translocation mechanism . Patients must pretreated cytotoxic chemotherapy .</detailed_description>

Patient must follow laboratory value follow laboratory value correct supplement within normal limit screen : Potassium ≥ low limit normal ( LLN ) Magnesium ≥ LLN Phosphorus ≥ LLN Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) ≥ LLN 14 . A male subject father potential must use adequate method contraception avoid conception throughout study [ 12 week last dose study drug ] minimize risk pregnancy . If partner pregnant breastfeeding , subject must use condom . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . 15 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 12 week last dose study drug minimize risk pregnancy . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour start investigational product . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception .
