	<brief_title>Skin Camouflage Women Prisoners With Self-Harm Scarring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research study aim establish feasibility acceptability use medical skin camouflage self-harm scar woman 's prison . The investigator interested use medical skin camouflage woman recover self-harm . The research location Closed Category prison female adult young offender England . The study involve adult woman prisoner ( 18 ) staff prison . Medical Skin Camouflage use specialise cream disguise scar intention normalise appearance skin . Studies examine use medical skin camouflage dermatological disease burn report significant psychological benefit social benefit . Preliminary finding co-applicant Dr Sandeep Ranote 's work , woman self-harm community , indicate use medical skin camouflage lead increase well-being , confidence ability partake social activity . Currently evidence use MSC self-harm scar prison . The research design intend provide information necessary decide whether feasible acceptable conduct full scale randomise control trial MSC . The four phase research follow : Phase 1 : Focus group prison . Interested prisoner staff provide information sheet phase 1 project 48 hour decide whether want take part phase research . After consent investigator conduct 2 focus group woman prisoner ( include current self-harmers ) prison staff ( 6-10 group ; 12-20 total ) . The focus group design achieve two aim : ensure appropriate outcome measure use phase four pilot ; explore barrier delivery medical skin camouflage prison environment . The focus group last 60-90 minute . In group investigator shall explore following : 1 . Any potential problem introduction MSC . For example , implement camouflage secure environment require structure framework referral within prison , understanding frequency MSC application , determine whether cream keep woman Safer Custody prevent prisoner trading . 2 . How training long-term prisoner camouflage practitioner undertake ( see phase 3 ) . 3 . With woman prisoner : investigator discuss scar affect mood , self-esteem , self-confidence , resilience , others perceive . These question design assess best collate information scar affect prisoner 's life , mental health , resilience stigma inform outcome measure phase 4 . Part consultation involve ask help u adapt standard measure wellbeing ( WEMWEB ) appropriate prison environment . 4 . The investigator also discuss use Assessment , Care Custody Teamwork data ( ACCT ) Inpatient Mental Health Records pilot trial . Prisoners risk self harm assess prison Safer Custody team follow ACCT procedure include record incident self-harm . The focus group digitally record , transcribed checked accuracy . The data analyse member research team . To mitigate possible researcher bias independent experience researcher review finding . During phase 1 member research team also train become medical skin camouflage practitioner . This training deliver Changing Faces , third-sector organisation train volunteer use MSC . Training accredit Royal College Nursing ( 2012 ) . This training do preparation phase 3 . Phase 2 : Guidance protocol Using finding phase 1 , investigator refine study process procedure ready next two phase . This involve : 1 . The production guidance protocol use medical skin camouflage prison . The protocol focus practical aspect , treatment deliver , applies ; apply ; prescribe , storage prescribed product . 2 . Finalising train lifer deliver support ( preparation phase 3 ) . 3 . Finalising eligibility criterion phase 4 , e.g . assessment make self-harm scar wound , establish woman recovery self-harm , woman refer project team referral process . 4 . Finalising outcome measure use phase 4 . 5 . If necessary , refine standard operating procedure monitor manage incident self-harm intervention . Phase 3 : Training lifer This phase research involve train long-term prison ( lifer ) deliver medical skin camouflage intervention woman prisoner phase 4 . By train lifer deliver intervention investigator ensure woman prisoner integral delivery camouflage woman offender . Not genuinely include stakeholder research , also build capacity within prison likely increase self-efficacy/self-worth woman . Provision intervention lifer prison make research , future use intervention , sustainable keep resource cost . In phase 3 MSC train research team member implement roll programme train support 6 long-term woman prisoner able deliver MSC intervention . These prisoner need personal experience self-harm . During phase phase 4 , Changing Faces provide regular mentoring advice practical aspect product use . The research team ensure advice pass long-term prisoner . The woman lifer receive ongoing supportive liaison throughout project member research team , design address , appropriately refer , psychological difficulty might occur . The project manager liaise prison lifer ensure fidelity guidance protocol . Phase 4 Phase 4 small scale randomise wait list control pilot . A sample 40 sentenced woman prisoner self-harm scar prison recruit ; 20 participant randomise receive 6 week camouflage intervention ; 20 participant become wait-list control receive intervention completion 6-week trial . The trial participant remand sentence woman prisoner screen date release , least 6 week leave sentence self-harm scarring , close wound ( allow MSC apply ) . Eligible female prisoner identify prison , example use information know Safer Custody team . Once identify research team provide potential participant information sheet . Following earlier research prison , investigator envisage potential participant allocate research number assure anonymity research team . This process allow researcher send participant information sheet relevant potential participant allow participant make informed decision participation prior identify researcher . Potential participant give 24-48 hour decide whether want consent involvement . The Clinical Research Network assist research assistant recruitment pilot trial . A member research team interview woman start trial collect information following : 1 . Basic demographic 2 . Women , service research-centred outcome determine Phase I 3 . Psychosocial well-being 4 . Social function 5 . Everyday activity 6 . Health-related quality life The MSC treatment provide 6 week . A monthly clinic offer woman practitioner prison ( lifer ) 4-5 woman see individually one occasion 1 hour . During appointment , participant receive information specially formulate MSC cream . The lifer take ethnic skin tone colour-matching process try small amount cream find match . After , apply cream large area use special powder set cream make sure waterproof . Throughout appointment , explanation give participant able watch process mirror . The participant able try apply camouflage cream . When happy look , practitioner complete prescription form process medical doctor . The prescription provide one set cream last several month . During intervention research team record data new self-harm incident relate life-events ( use ACCT data Inpatient mental health record ) . After MSC intervention , within week finish research team meet participant collect post intervention data . Initial post-intervention test 6 week average sentence length woman prison . Six week post-intervention investigator repeat baseline measure apart ( HRQoL ) measure . Three month post intervention pilot collection HRQoL data participant follow-up data . Recruitment , participation , retention cause drop-out also collect . Post intervention investigator conduct qualitative interview follow group : 1 . Approximately 20 prisoner receive intervention evaluate experience intervention acceptability . The investigator explore participant view treatment accessibility i.e . apply make-up , long stay , perceive usefulness , effect everyday life potential impact woman feel scar , mood , self-esteem self-confidence . 2.6-10 prison health staff direct contact participant take part focus group . This explore view relation treatment ' acceptability perceive effect participant ' well-being , quality life everyday functioning . 3 . 6 interview conduct lifer deliver intervention explore acceptable training , MSC use participant , feedback mentor support benefit difficulty work participant . During course research investigator also explore best way calculate resource use associate provide MSC prison . The investigator shall develop bespoke resource use questionnaire pilot collection resource use data concern delivery intervention , include time spend Changing Faces training/mentoring , time spend trained prisoner deliver intervention , quantity MSC product use prescribed . Descriptive analysis data inform future trial design . An adapted version Secure Facilities Service Use Schedule ( SF-SUS ) use collect relevant resource-use 3month follow-up : contact personal , Safer custody general prison officer , staff mental health team ; time one-to-one observation , specialist mental health unit ; record observation care plan . SF-SUS record individual-level data service use within secure facility external service economic evaluation .</detailed_description>
