	<brief_summary>Patients harbor dolichoectactic vertebrobasilar ( DVB ) aneurysms risk suffering SAH , ischemic stroke , and/or brainstem compression many patient offer invasive treatment due futility exist surgical method . Consequently , demand development medical therapy DVB aneurysm</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infliximab Therapy Dolichoectactic Vertebrobasilar Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar ( DVB ) aneurysms fusiform geometry often large ( &lt; 10 cm ) size limit traditional microsurgical clipping endovascular coiling strategy . Collectively , DVB aneurysms represent ≤ 0.01 % aneurysm ( ~ 600 US ) , consequently , study limit small series . Despite rarity , location geometry DVB aneurysm make surgical intervention , microsurgical endovascular , nearly uniformly fatal . Therefore , DVB aneurysms observe provide great insight natural history many surgically amenable aneurysm . One series note 28 % patient manifest neurological deficit , ischemic hemorrhagic , 4 year interval overall mortality rate ~ 20 % . Tumor necrosis alpha ( TNFα ) . From many implicate genetic pathway aneurysm formation , tumor necrosis alpha ( TNFα ) note pivotal actor . In pre-clinical study , ability inhibit TNFα induction prevents aneurysm rupture even aneurysm growth altogether . In human , TNFα inhibitor therapy proven effective many type vascular inflammation include carotid wall thicken set rheumatoid arthritis . Over 12- 24-month interval , others demonstrate significant decrease carotid intima-media thickness patient take TNFα inhibitor , infliximab . Furthermore , infliximab therapy proven effective refractory Kawasaki 's disease , condition characterize post-infectious coronary artery inflammation child . There also evidence infliximab therapy effective treatment IVIG-refractory Kawasaki 's disease include regress coronary aneurysm . Despite multitude agent indication off-label , TNFα inhibitor therapy use treatment brain aneurysm .</detailed_description>
