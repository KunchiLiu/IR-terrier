	<brief_title>An Investigation General Predictors CBT Outcome Anxiety Disorders Naturalistic Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorder pervasive problem , estimate 12-month prevalence 16.6 % , associate significant impairment high social cost . Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) show effective treat anxiety disorder . CBT furthermore cost-effectiveness.This make CBT first choice treatment anxiety disorder many mental health setting around world . Despite impressive evidence-base , relatively large group individual benefit CBT , relapse , drop treatment . Thus , clear press need improve efficacy effectiveness CBT anxiety disorder . One way improve identify predictor CBT outcome . In naturalistic clinical setting , identification prognostic factor help allocate resource presume benefit CBT , also identify may need additional CBT , adjunctive therapy , entirely different treatment maximize outcome . Current knowledge likely benefit CBT sparse stem primarily well-controlled laboratory setting . These result may generalize patient outcome mental health setting , patient severe comorbid disorder often see . Thus , naturalistic study potential significantly increase knowledge , inform clinical strategy , thus improve treatment offer mental health setting . Furthermore , exist study mostly investigate socio-demographic factor predictor drop-out non-response . However , variable show either non-significant inconsistent predictor outcome . Results concern comorbidity predictor also mixed . In sum , knowledge likely benefit CBT sparse , date reliable predictor identify . While prior work primarily emphasize atheoretical predictor , may prove fruitful focus predictor variable stem psychological theory . Identifying predictor provide direct prognostic information clinician . Additionally , predictor could also inform development adjunctive component treatment may optimize treatment poorer CBT outcome . Some exciting study suggest line inquiry could yield relevant result . Maintaining factor one aspect highlight several therapeutic approaches/theories crucial treatment anxiety disorder , accordingly factor often target cognitive behavioral treatment . Emotion regulation attentional control examples key maintain factor anxiety disorder . CBT , aim teach patient cognitive reappraisal maladaptive cognition encourage approach ( rather avoidance ) behavior via cognitive restructuring exposure , may suitable patient certain characteristic . Specifically , recent research theory suggest crucial effective treatment anxiety disorder client learn tolerate fear expose anxiety-provoking stimulus , rather merely habituate stimulus . Learning tolerate fear may require emotion regulation skills ability control attention support recent study . However , far certain area emotion regulation investigate date never naturalistic setting . Attentional control never examine predictor CBT outcomes . Accordingly , study design investigate predictive value attentional control three facet emotion regulation skill . Attentional control There strong evidence individual anxiety disorder bias attention towards threaten stimulus , consensus bias occur . Recent research suggest threat bias per se problematic . Rather , individual difference ability voluntarily control attention may affect impact threaten information hence increase decrease anxiety symptom . A potential consequence may individual low ability voluntarily control attention difficulty participate exposure and/or progress exposure hierarchy , level anxiety get high . This may subsequently lead failure learn fear dangerous even drop-out CBT . Furthermore , pronounce bias towards irrelevant negative information may take many resource process important , relevant information hamper , make difficult engage goal-oriented behavior experience anxiety . Emotion regulation predictor Novel theoretical framework emphasize difficulty emotion regulation associate development maintenance anxiety disorder . Additionally , emotion regulation skill may require engage benefit CBT . Furthermore , attempt increase effectiveness , several new treatment include emotion regulation training treatment protocol . The present study aim examine attentional control three facet emotion regulation : 1. awareness understanding emotion , 2. acceptance emotion , 3. ability engage goal-directed behavior , refrain impulsive behavior , experience negative emotion general predictor outcome CBT anxiety disorder naturalistic , community-based mental health setting . Our secondary aim examine theoretical variable ( i.e. , socio-demographic data clinical characteristic , comorbidity ) predictor CBT outcome , yet examine predictor real-world clinical setting mixed anxious sample . Investigators expect low ability control attention associate poor treatment outcome . Similarly , expect high score emotion dysregulation relate poorer treatment outcome . Given exploratory nature study also interested test non-linear relationship . Method In order maximize external validity , investigator conduct study within two real-world treatment clinic employ minimal exclusion criterion recruit sample mixed principal anxiety disorder . Patients recruit two clinic .</detailed_description>
