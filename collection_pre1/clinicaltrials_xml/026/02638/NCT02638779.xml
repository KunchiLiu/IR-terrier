	<brief_summary>The fact sepsis disrupts immune system homeostasis induce initial cytokine storm , participate occurrence organ failure early death , follow compensatory anti-inflammatory response lead immunosuppression , well establish . This immunomodulating response result high risk secondary infection associate 2/3 death relate septic shock . Follow patient ' immune status time crucial guide therapy management . Objective REALISM project demonstrate existence immunosuppression phase , provide strong epidemiologic data septic shock patient , also extension situation inflammatory aggression like severe severe trauma burn , major surgery . This project provide tool predict occurrence secondary infection guide patient management compare innovate immunomonitoring tool reference test non already adapt routine patient management . Targeted population adult patient hospitalize septic shock , severe trauma ( include severe burn ) major surgery healthy volunteer , blood sample serve validate reference interval two reference test .</brief_summary>
