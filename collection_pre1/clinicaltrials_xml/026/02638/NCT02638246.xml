	<detailed_description>Intensive glycemic control among diabetic decrease risk development progression number medical complication associate diabetes . Self-monitoring blood glucose critical component diabetes self-management correlated improvement glycemic control . Nevertheless , adherence blood glucose monitor generally poor , particularly among youth , one study report ~ 25 % adolescent adhere recommended frequency blood glucose testing . The current study use powerful , scientifically-based behavioral intervention - contingency management ( CM ) increase self-monitoring blood glucose improve glycemic control among adolescent Type 1 diabetes . CM involve give incentive objective evidence target behavior show robust reliable impact promote behavior change . Our previous research use Internet objectively monitor smoke reinforce smoking cessation ( via video record carbon monoxide submission ) , result robust increase smoke abstinence . The current proposal extend effective Internet-based CM intervention address significant health issue non-adherence blood glucose test glycemic control among youth . Two group non-adherent adolescent recruit . One group earn incentive Internet submit webcam record video show test blood glucose . A different group give standard care recommendation blood glucose test management encourage submit glucose monitoring video , incentive deliver contingent submission ( instead , earn monetary incentive independent video submission , overall amount match earnings participant group ) . The purpose study evaluate feasibility , convenience , efficacy use Internet-based CM increase blood glucose monitoring adolescent Type 1 diabetic . Combining accessibility Internet powerful , evidence-based behavioral intervention profound effect adherence diabetes self-management important population . Improving adherence diabetes management adolescent significant public health issue - serious medical complication , heart disease nerve damage , would develop poor glycemic control avoid . Importantly , current study offer scientifically-based behavioral intervention could apply range population behavior relevant adherence diabetes regimen ( e.g. , adult , medication adherence , carbohydrate counting , insulin dose adjustment , etc . ) .</detailed_description>
