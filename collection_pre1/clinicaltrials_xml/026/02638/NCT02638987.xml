	<detailed_description>Neck-shoulder pain frequent problem office worker . These complaint often related myofascial problem neck shoulder muscle upper trapezius frequently involve . Trapezius myalgia ( TM ) characterize pain , palpable stiffness tenderness upper part trapezius muscle . Several study show myofascial trigger point ( MTrP ) important role development maintenance myofascial pain . Trigger point define hyperirritable nodule contracture skeletal muscle fiber . The pathophysiology MTrPs still unclear several hypothesis exist . The plausible explanation , due sustain posture repetitive low-level task , sustain irritation motor end plat excessive release acetylcholine arise . This may lead persistent sarcomere contraction , lead impaired blood circulation , reduce oxygenation energy depletion , sensitize nociceptors cause pain . Dry needling ( DN ) myofascial treatment technique , thin , solid filiform needle insert directly MTrP . During dry needling , local twitch response ( LTR ) elicit . These involuntary contraction muscle fiber , lead muscle relaxation , increase blood flow , recovery muscle metabolism thus reduction pain stiffness . In experimental study , 25 female office worker trapezius myalgia recruit several work place predominantly computer base task . These subject perform least 20 hour week computer work since least one year . Subjects include base online questionnaire , clinical examination neck shoulder presence MTRP 2 upper trapezius . All participant receive information sign inform consent form . Participants subject baseline assessment involve measure rest surface EMG activity , muscle tone , stiffness , elasticity pain . Then , subject perform computer task 20 minute surface EMG activity measure every 5 minute . After computer task , measurement repeat . After rest period 10 minute , baseline measurement repeat , follow computer task 20 minute repetition assessment . After computer task , single dry needling session MTrP 2 upper trapezius perform bilaterally . During treatment , surface EMG activity measure captivate EMG activity local twitch response . This follow repeat measurement 1 10 minute dry needling .</detailed_description>
