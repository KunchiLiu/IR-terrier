	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see whether combination two drug call pembrolizumab vorinostat help people advanced lung cancer . Researchers also want find combination pembrolizumab vorinostat safe tolerable . This study compare effect combination two drug call pembrolizumab vorinostat effect pembrolizumab alone . The U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve pembrolizumab use treat deadly skin cancer call melanoma lung cancer vorinostat treat form blood lymph node cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembro Vorinostat Patients With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase I/Randomized Phase II clinical trial pembrolizumab vorinostat Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0-1 patient immune therapy naïve immune therapy pretreated locally advanced metastatic NSCLC progress one prior line therapy . The begins phase I dose escalation utilizing modify continuous reassessment method ( O'Quigley , Pepe , &amp; Fisher , 1990 ) . This would follow phase I expansion maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 18 NSCLC patient previously treat anti-PD-1 anti-PD-L1 therapy . In parallel , separate phase II arm randomize 70 patient pembrolizumab alone group pembrolizumab plus vorinostat group .</detailed_description>

Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy dose ≥ 10 mg prednisone form systemic immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Participants permit use topical , ocular , intraarticular , intranasal , inhalational corticosteroid ( minimal systemic absorption ) . Physiologic replacement dos systemic corticosteroid permit , even &gt; = 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent . A brief course ( ≤28 day ) corticosteroid prophylaxis ( e.g. , contrast dye allergy ) treatment nonautoimmune condition ( e.g. , delayedtype hypersensitivity reaction cause contact allergen ) permit . Has know history tuberculosis ( TB ) Disease ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab , vorinostat excipients . Participants enrol phase II randomize trial , prior treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , antiCTLA 4 antibody antibody drug specifically target immune checkpoint pathway ( i.e . `` immune therapy naïve '' ) . Note : For enrolled phase I dose escalation , prior use PD1 PDL1 , antiCTLA4 antibody antibody drug specifically target immune checkpoint pathway allow . For participant phase , prior use vaccine treatment cancer allow . Participants enrol phase Ib expansion never previously treat PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , antiCTLA 4 antibody antibody drug specifically target immune checkpoint pathway past ( i.e . `` pretreated '' ) . Participants receive thoracic radiation &gt; 30Gy within 6 month first dose pembrolizumab . Patients take HDACi vorinostat . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy 3 week , target small molecule therapy radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Patients ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : Patients grade alopecia exception criterion may qualify study . If participant receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy , situ cervical cancer .
