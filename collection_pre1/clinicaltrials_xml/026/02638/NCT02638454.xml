	<detailed_description>The age-associated loss skeletal muscle mass function ( sarcopenia ) associate substantial social economic cost . The plasticity adaptability skeletal muscle contraction ( ie . resistance-exercise ) fundamental physiological event lead large robust skeletal muscle . However , muscle growth response resistance exercise ( RE ) , like anabolic stimulus , attenuate old adult . The cause aberrant muscle adaptation age complex . Recent work reveal novel role small non-coding RNAs , call microRNAs ( miRNA ) regulation gene expression . Using integrated bioinformatics analysis protein-coding gene miRNA array data young old men , I identify ten specific miRNAs important regulator muscle plasticity ( Plasticity Related miRs [ PR-miRs ] ) lead transcriptional response exercise lean mass young old men . However , precise mechanism underlie expression PR-miRs age-related change muscle anabolism sarcopenia currently unknown . Thus , overall objective K01 application determine mechanistic role ( ) PR-miRs skeletal muscle adaptation anabolic stimulation : 1. healthy young , 2. sarcopenic old 3. age- functionally-matched non-sarcopenic older male female . This accomplished determine difference expression PR-miRs age sarcopenia response anabolic stimulation ( AIM 1 ) . Mechanistically determine extent manipulation PR-miR level vitro , human primary myocytes , reverse anabolic resistance observe age sarcopenia ( AIM 2 ) effect alter PR-miRs level skeletal muscle growth development ( AIM 3 ) . This project improve understand molecular mechanism contribute loss skeletal muscle eventually leading development drug therapy treatment sarcopenia ever grow age population .</detailed_description>
