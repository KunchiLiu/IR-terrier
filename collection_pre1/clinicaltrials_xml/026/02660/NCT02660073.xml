	<brief_summary>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) devastate medical problem affect thousand civilian military personnel United States . Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) predispose individual impaired fitness , obesity , glucose intolerance insulin resistance , place great risk diabetes coronary artery disease . These devastate problem occur frequently change body composition reduce level physical activity . Skeletal muscle waste plays central role alter metabolism SCI . Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) effective rehabilitation tool use train paralyzed skeletal muscle show ability ameliorate deleterious effect SCI metabolism , particularly insulin sensitivity . However , ability reverse skeletal muscle waste modest ; study report limited gain muscle mass workload highly variable outcomes one study another . This proposal stimulate finding program neuromuscular electrical stimulation resistance exercise prior initiate functional electrical stimulation lower extremity cycling ( FES-LEC ) improve gain muscle mass workload observe FES . The specific objective current proposal compare impact FES follow evoke skeletal muscle hypertrophy low extremity versus initiate FES cycling without introduce hypertrophy effect insulin sensitivity , control blood sugar level , oxygen uptake amount muscle tissue fat deposition . These study could potentially significant effect thousand people experience SCI future well live SCI prolong paralysis major quality life issue . There major need investigate mechanism lead maximize benefit FES application understand cellular molecular event associate muscle hypertrophy lead promote metabolic health SCI . The design study provide great understand regard utilization energy source ( like fat sugar ) muscle</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives Aim # 1 : To determine impact 12+12 week neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) +FES-LEC oxygen uptake , insulin sensitivity glucose uptake adult SCI compare control + FES-LEC . Aim # 2 : To determine impact 12+12 week NMES+FES-LEC skeletal muscle size , infiltration intramuscular fat , visceral adiposity well fatigue resistance compare control+ FES-LEC . . Aim # 3 : To determine impact 12+12 week NMES+FES-LEC determinant energy metabolism , protein molecule involve insulin signal , muscle hypertrophy oxygen uptake ( IRS-1 , adenosine monophosphate kinase ( AMPK ) , glucose transporter ( GLUT-4 ) , insulin like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) , Akt , mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator ( PGC-1 alpha ) electron transport chain protein compare control + FES-LEC . Subjects : Forty eight chronic ( 1 year post-injury ) individual motor complete SCI recruit Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Spinal Cord Dysfunction registry Virginia Commonwealth University 4 year . Inclusion Criteria 1 . All participant 18-65 year old , men/women , 2. great one year post SCI , 3 . Body mass index ( BMI ) &lt; 30 Kg/m2 . 4 . Participants must C5-L2 level injury , traumatic motor complete incomplete SCI [ American Spinal Injury Impairment Scale Classification ( AIS A , B C ) ] . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Participants follow pre-existing medical condition exclude ( cardiovascular disease , uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus , uncontrolled hypertension , insulin , pressure sore stage 3 great ) , hematocrit 50 % urinary tract infection symptom . 2 . Participants osteoporosis ( T-score equal worse -2.5 accord World Health recommendation ) exclude . 3 . Pregnant woman woman involve become pregnant course study exclude well . Study arm 1 . NMES+FES group ( n =24 ; 2 days/week 24 week ) ; group undergo twice weekly 12 week surface NMES ankle weight follow 12 additional week twice weekly progressive FES-LEC use RT300 bike . The total participation duration 24 week +3 week measurement . 2 . Control + FES group ( n =24 ; 2 days/week 24 week ) ; group undergo twice weekly 12 week passive leg extension/flexion ankle weight follow 12 additional week twice weekly progressive FES-LEC use RT300 bike . The total participation duration 24 weeks+3 week measurement .</detailed_description>
