	<brief_summary>The purpose study conduct randomize clinical trial compare antibiotic strategy base novel diagnostic test , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) usual care , critically ill adult pneumonia suspect caused methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) . The investigator hypothesize automate PCR use guide antibiotic therapy , antibiotic exposure reduce critically ill subject pneumonia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bacterial resistance antibiotic major problem intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . The Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) estimate drug resistant infection affect 2 million individual nationwide cause 23,000 death annually . In recent executive order , President United States call improve antibiotic stewardship development rapid diagnostic test identify antibiotic resistant infection . In ICU patient pneumonia , guideline advocate routine use broad spectrum antibiotic patient . In large part diagnostic test pneumonia insensitive slow inform decision make appropriate antibiotic . Overuse broad spectrum antibiotic promote drug resistance select antibiotic resistant bacterial strain . This proposal apply new diagnostic test , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , rapidly identify drug resistant pathogen , methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) reduce inappropriate antibiotic ICU patient suspect pneumonia . MRSA important cause drug resistant pneumonia associate high mortality . Methicillin resistance Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) result acquisition mecA gene locate mobile element staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec ( SCCmec ) . MRSA pneumonia require specific antibiotic therapy , treatment guideline recommend addition empiric antibiotic MRSA patient admit ICU risk factor DRPs . The investigator prior work demonstrate significant overlap MRSA risk factor risk factor DRPs , potentially lead overuse anti-MRSA antibiotic . Globally , MRSA pneumonia occur estimate 2-6 % ICU patient . By contrast , empiric anti-MRSA therapy prescribe majority ICU patient suspect pneumonia . The investigator show institution , prevalence MRSA 5.5 % , empiric anti-MRSA therapy prescribe 89.5 % ICU patient pneumonia . The large gap empiric antibiotic therapy MRSA pneumonia actual case MRSA pneumonia due lack specificity DRP risk factor , time delay bacterial culture . Overuse antibiotic MRSA adverse consequence patient , include new hospital acquire infection ( HAIs ) , increase hospital length stay ( LOS ) , high cost . Faster accurate diagnostic test MRSA , PCR , potential reduce antibiotic exposure improve patient outcomes . The time delay bacterial culture lack specificity DRP risk factor major limitation treatment pneumonia , particularly ICUs rapid delivery appropriate antibiotic could life save . PCR potential change paradigm empiric antibiotic increase diagnostic certainty reduce time diagnosis exclusion resistant pathogen . However , molecular diagnostic test yet validate routine clinical practice . The goal trial compare conduct clinical trial compare PCR guide approach MRSA therapy usual care determine 1 ) antibiotic strategy utilizes rapid automate PCR reduce antibiotic-days ICU subject suspect pneumonia , 2 ) To compare safety antibiotic strategy relies rapid automate PCR usual care , 3 ) To compare cost rapid automate PCR base strategy routine microbiologic culture .</detailed_description>
