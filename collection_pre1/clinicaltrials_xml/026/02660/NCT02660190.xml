	<brief_title>Photodynamic Diagnosis ( PDD ) Flexible Cystoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Bladder cancer heterogeneous disease range minimal pathology small non-invasive Ta-tumors low malignancy ( Papillary Urothelial Neoplasm Low Malignant Potential low grade Ta tumour ) easily fulgurated upon cystoscopy deeply invasive metastasize disease fatal course despite aggressive treatment . Moreover , urothelial pathology range flat lesion visible regular white light massive bulky tumor . In advanced tumor stage deeply invasive T1-tumours muscle invasive disease ( T2 ) high risk progression tumour , node , metastasis ( TNM ) stage large challenge thus prevent aggressive radical treatment . In low tumor stage non-invasive Ta-tumors even superficially infiltrate non-muscle invasive tumor , vast majority patient progress regard stage half patient experience recurrence tumor stage bladder . These recurrence time consuming , expensive treat high number , affect quality life result need frequent follow-up visit recurrent procedure . Flat lesion recur frequently intravesical treatment associate high risk progression leave untreated . Recurrent tumor mostly treat transurethral resection bladder ( TURB ) general anesthesia . However , recognize early stage , tumor safely fulgurated outpatient clinic . Moreover , recognition flat lesion even carcinoma situ ( CIS ) early stage presume associate low risk progression advance tumor stage . Therefore , reduction size number recurrence early recognition flat lesion desire . Early recurrence within first year follow primary TURB think arise small area flat dysplasia , CIS , small sub-visible papilloma recognize primary procedure . PDD technique photodynamic drug instal preoperatively bladder . Mucosa cell higher metabolism normal urothelial cell , e.g . cancer cell , absorbs drug utilized cystoscopy blue light absorb drug , make surgeon able distinguish tumor cell normal cell thus able identify flat lesion small papilloma miss white light cystoscopy . The use PDD primary TURB show associate low recurrence rate within first year , probably mostly owe high detection rate small papilloma dysplasia therefore relevantly treat early stage . Despite use PDD primary TURB , high number patient experience early recurrence patient carcinoma situ ( CIS ) treat bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) may recurrence CIS recurrence papilloma despite peroperative use PDD . Whereas use PDD well establish TURB setting , use PDD follow-up setting flexible cystoscopy outpatient clinic investigate . Feasibility study successful clinical relevance benefit investigate far . Thesis The thesis study use PDD outpatient clinic patient high recurrence risk undergo follow-up flexible cystoscopy result diagnosis papilloma earlier use conventional flexible cystoscopy white light . Thus , high number tumour treat outpatient set without need procedure general anesthesia . Furthermore , number follow-up cystoscopies reduce PDD use first cystoscopy follow TURB . Aims To investigate whether use PDD perform flexible cystoscopy outpatient clinic reduce number recurrence large size papilloma treat simple fulguration without general anesthesia . Methods The study design prospective , randomize study randomization conventional white light flexible cystoscopy PDD flexible cystoscopy . The study include follow category patient high risk tumor recurrence : • All patient come first outpatient flexible cystoscopy 4 month TURB without subsequent BCG instillation . Patients inform study visit patient accept give , randomization make time cystoscopy . Patients PDD-arm receive intravesical instillation Hexvix 1 hour prior cystoscopy . Cystoscopy make Storz flexible PDD-cystoscope . Patients handle follow accord national Danish bladder tumor guideline . This include follow-up cystoscopy 4 12 month follow primary TURB patient low grade Ta tumor follow-up cystoscopy four month interval first 2 year follow diagnosis patient high grade tumor CIS . If tumor recurrence diagnose , size large tumor estimate base interval : le 5 mm , 5-10 mm , 11-20 mm , 20 mm . All tumor recurrences suspicious area mucosa histologically verify either resection biopsy fulguration . Follow-up cystoscopies outpatient clinic perform white light ( WL ) arm . Primary endpoint : • Tumor recurrence find outpatient flexible cystoscopies follow include cystoscopy 4 month TURB intervention make . Patients dichotomize regard recurrence primary endpoint `` recurrence cystoscopy '' versus `` recurrence '' cystoscopy 8 12 month primary TURB . Secondary outcome : - Number procedures general anesthesia within 12 month TURB - Tumor recurrence 5 mm , 10 mm , 20 mm within 12 month TURB - Progression stage within 12 month TURB - Identification flat lesion include CIS Statistics Power calculation make one-sided test 5 % significance level risk type I error ( alpha ) 0.05 risk type II error ( beta ) 0.20 . Given recurrence rate 35 % within first 12 month presume 15 % patient recurrence find 4 month cystoscopy leave minimum 20 % detection 8 12 month cystoscopy . This recurrence rate slightly underestimated patient recurrences 4 month also high risk recurrence follow cystoscopies . Recurrence rate estimate reduce one third ( absolute 7 % ) 13 % 8 12 month cystoscopy use PDD 4 month cystoscopy . Thus , number 696 patient need use equal size group 348 randomization arm . Ethics The study approve Regional Science Ethics Committee ( Number 1-10-72-76-15 ) Danish Data Protection Agency ( Number 1-16-02-111-15 ) . The study report clinicaltrials.gov initiation . The study submit approval Danish Health And Medicines Authority . The local good clinical practice ( GCP ) -units allocate trial . Timeframe The study plan begin February 2016 . Inclusion patient 696 patient expect terminate within 18 month period . Follow-up last patient include make 8 month follow inclusion give estimate time study analysis end 2018 . Set-up The study perform single surgeon , multi center study . Thus , one surgeon perform cystoscopies three location . Moreover nurse involved handle cystoscopes patient three location limit two location . This ensure quality study especially reduce risk unintentional damage equipment include cystoscopes . The three study location : - The outpatient clinic Herlev Herlev Hospital - The outpatient clinic Holstebro Hospital West Denmark - The outpatient clinic Aarhus University Hospital Based patient catchment area involve center , expect include 40 % Herlev Hospital ( approximately 280 patient ) , 35 % Aarhus University Hospital ( approximately 245 patient ) , 25 % Hospital West Denmark ( approximately 175 patient ) . These expected number subject change depend inclusion rate involve center . Additional project regard health economics , logistics time use flexible PDD Along major project , two additional project perform . One research year student look health economics use flexible PDD . In , time spend additional examination biopsy compare time save case reduce recurrence rate lead few TURB 's cystoscopies . Moreover , finance save reduce number TURB 's cystoscopies compare additional cost use PDD . The project nurse lead study evaluate feasibility logistics implement flexible PDD outpatient clinic . These study evaluate three involved clinic give valid insight one-center study .</detailed_description>
