	<brief_title>Contribution Clinical Pathway Treatment Hip Prosthesis Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence surgical site infection follow orthopedic surgery 1 % . The number prosthesis infection estimate 2000 2500 new case year France . Multiple medical surgical care strategy possible depend acute chronic presentation , early delay antibiotic therapy ; antibiotic therapy alone associate joint lavage , prosthesis change one two stage ; long short period time , without fit spacer . The practice heterogeneous chronic infection depend terrain infection occur modality antibiotic therapy remain controversial . The treatment failure rate 1 year estimate 20 % . The hypothesis raise implementation clinical pathway would improve performance medical surgical management chronic infection prosthetic hip . Objectives : To determine contribution clinical pathway improve effectiveness medico-surgical management hip prosthesis infection term clinical cure . The secondary objective : To evaluate medical surgical practice diagnosis treatment hip prosthesis infection ; identify success factor therapeutic failure medical surgical support hip prosthesis infection term clinical cure ; determine management quality indicator . Methods : The clinical path develop committee expert national international recommendation , review literature focus prosthesis conservation strategy audit practice University Hospital Grenoble . The clinical path evaluate interventional trial cluster control group , randomize , step wedge ( inclusion stagger time 4 X 3 month ) evaluation one year . The study population include patient treated hip prosthesis infection hospital participate Alps , period 16 month . The primary endpoint clinical cure one year , define absence clinical sign infection , inflammatory syndrome ( C-Reactive Protein &lt; 10 mg / L ) , radiological sign infection . Analysis : The association primary endpoint introduction clinical path quantify odds ratio estimate use logistic regression model adjustment baseline characteristic patient inclusion non-independence observation .</detailed_description>
