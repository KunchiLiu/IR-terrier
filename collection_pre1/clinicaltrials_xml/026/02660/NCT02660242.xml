	<brief_title>The Use Mini-dose Glucagon Prevent Exercise-induced Hypoglycemia Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective protocol determine administration mini-dose glucagon administer subcutaneously exercise produce good glucose stability adjustment moderate intensity exercise patient Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) . It also assess whether mini-dose glucagon exercise produce good glucose stability basal insulin reduction extra carbohydrate consumption . This randomized , 4-way crossover trial . The trial include 16 participant complete study . Each participant undergo four aerobic exercise session ( random order ) , different strategy glucose regulation : - Control Trial : Fasted exercise , basal insulin reduction - Strategy 1 : Fasted exercise , basal insulin reduction ( 50 % reduction basal rate 60 minute exercise , duration exercise ) - Strategy 2 : Fasted exercise , basal adjustment + pre-exercise glucose tab ( buccal route-40 gram total ) - Strategy 3 : Fasted exercise , basal adjustment + pre-exercise mini-dose glucagon ( sc ) In 4 session , aerobic exercise perform fasted state ( standardized meal ) 45 minuet ~50-55 % participant 's per-determined aerobic capacity . The participant 's pump blind control trial , strategy 1 , strategy 3 injection saline give control trial strategy 1 participant blind strategy . The primary outcome study glycemic response exercise early recovery .</detailed_description>
