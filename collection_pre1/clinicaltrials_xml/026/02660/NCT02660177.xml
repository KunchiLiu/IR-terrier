	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Intravenous Metamizole Children Less Than 6 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label pharmacokinetics ( PK ) study . It aim assess PK parameter metamizole metabolite follow single IV administration metamizole ( 10mg/kg ) child le 6 year age . Thirty-nine child , 3-72 month age , undergo elective surgery University Basel Children 's Hospital , receive , day surgical procedure , single dose metamizole 10 mg/kg . After dose , blood saliva sample obtain predetermine post-dose time point measure concentration metamizole metabolite . The maximal duration subject participation 24 hour . Plasma PK parameter ( AUC , Cmax , Tmax , t1/2 ) analyte derive use noncompartmental method . A population PK approach apply characterize inter-subject variability quantify potential influence age , sex body weight PK parameter . There publish pharmacokinetic study metamizole pediatrics . Furthermore , although Swissmedic provide dose information IV administration infant body weight less 9 kg , IV frequently use route administration direct postoperative analgesia pediatrics , include infant body weight less 9 kg . Due absence data lack dose recommendation infant body weight less 9 kg , IV administration metamizole infant `` off-label '' inconsistent across hospital prescribe paediatrician .</detailed_description>
