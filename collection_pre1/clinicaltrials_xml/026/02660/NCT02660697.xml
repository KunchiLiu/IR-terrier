	<brief_title>3D Radiographic Evaluation Novel Implant Site Development Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In advanced ( Extraction Defect Sounding Class 3-4 ) alveolar defect , minimally invasive tunnelised socket preservation technique utilise long term resorbable membrane connective tissue graft use extraction site development ( XSD ) . The novel technique evaluate retrospective comparative case series study include total 54 extraction site . In test group , 33 single root teeth , 29 maxilla 4 mandible remove , extraction site treat XSD method . Out 33 teeth , 27 incisor , 2 canine 4 premolar . In control group , 21 single root teeth , 11 maxilla 10 mandible extract leave spontaneous healing . Out 21 teeth , 13 incisor , 2 canine 6 premolar . CBCT scan take prior tooth extraction 6-9 month later group . Radiographic evaluation carry use I-CAT Vision ( Imaging Sciences International , LLC ; Hatfield , USA ) ImageJ ( National Institutes Health ) softwares . Following manual alignment CBCTs vertical horizontal linear measurement well planimetric measurement cross-section area perform pre- postoperative data set extraction site .</detailed_description>
