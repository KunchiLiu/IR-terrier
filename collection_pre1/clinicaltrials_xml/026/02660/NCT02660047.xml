	<brief_summary>Among South Asians , comparison Western Europeans , increase risk type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2 ) DM2-related cardiovascular disease . The effect Liraglutide ( Victoza® ) cardiovascular function therefore investigate DM2 patient group South Asian descent specifically . Liraglutide new widely prescribe therapeutic agent DM2 patient . It Glucagon Like Peptide - 1 homologue improves glucose homeostasis reduces blood pressure body weight . The disadvantageous metabolic phenotype see South Asians include relatively large total fat mass , predominately visceral relative subcutaneous adipose tissue lower brown adipose tissue volume activity , accompany increase lipid level . The key element mechanism action Liraglutide seem correspond difference metabolic profile South Asians Western Europeans . Diastolic dysfunction , early finding cardiovascular disease DM2 obesity independent predictor mortality , show associated amount triglyceride accumulation heart liver . The investigator hypothesize Liraglutide direct advantageous cardiovascular effect reduces triglyceride accumulation end-organs , specifically DM2 patient South Asian descent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RECRUITMENT AND SCREENING PROCEDURE OF STUDY POPULATION Patients recruit outpatient clinic Leiden University Medical Center , general practitioner , local hospital advertisement . Patients physicists ask point eligible patient opportunity study participation . If interested , patient inform principal investigator . The screen consist medical history , physical examination consist measurement height , body weight , heart rate , blood pressure examination thorax abdomen . Furthermore laboratory test rest-ECG perform . If patient eligible willing participate study , sign informed consent , patient include . Informed consent must obtain trial related activity take place . After inclusion study protocol , patient 's treat physician general practitioner notify . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Clinically relevant difference standard deviation two study choose generate data sample size calculation . The data use incorporate precision MRI assessment cardiac function generate study perform group pioglitazone v metformin cardiac function parameter . To estimate effect GLP-1 therapy cardiac function , data pilot study eight DM2 patient heart failure . With power 90 % alfa = 0.05 , group vary 9 17 patient need . In comparable trial drop-out rate 10 % . Taken consideration population study significant well systolic function heart failure patient study Sokos et al , difference may small . In conclusion , investigator estimate able detect clinically relevant , significant result 90 % power alfa = 0.05 25 patient group . USE OF CO-INTERVENTION Patients continue use oral glucose lower medicament study . For glycaemic control initiation study drug , current clinical guideline follow . Glycaemic management study perform describe appendix 1 . To avoid potential risk hypoglycaemia , rigorous monitoring therapy adjustment schedule apply , prevent risk hypoglycemia great extent . In addition , patient instruct recognize manage hypo hyperglycaemic episode . Appropriate individualize adjustment make unlikely case hypo hyperglycaemic episode . Routine self-measurement blood glucose study participant perform week . In addition , patient insulin instructed perform routine self-measurement blood glucose frequently study medication / insulin dosage titrate . Furthermore patient ask change diet level physical activity study period adequate contraception obligatory study participation . RANDOMIZATION , BLINDING AND TREATMENT ALLOCATION After medical screen mutual agreement participation study , patient randomize block randomization , stratify 1:1 gender insulin use . A randomization schedule prepare research pharmacist employee Department Clinical Pharmacy . Coded seal envelope participant keep department Radiology . In case safety issue , seal envelope readily available principal investigator project leader . In case serious adverse event - medical emergency require knowledge study medication - randomization code broken . In order ensure medical emergency , study participation patient apparent , patient receive patient file electronic patient registry . In personal file , study number patient include procedure deblinding notification investigator mention . When whole study complete randomization list provide principle investigator pharmacist . STUDY PROCEDURES Withdrawal individual subject : Patients leave study time reason wish without consequence . The responsible investigator also withdraw subject continue participation opinion deleterious subject 's wellbeing . Patients also withdraw case protocol violation non-compliance . When subject withdraws study , medical examination perform . In case withdrawal severe serious adverse event , appropriate laboratory test special examination perform . Finally patient withdraw study participation incidental find MRI examination - example malignancy - influence ratio justification versus risk / benefit . Specific criterion withdrawal : applicable Replacement individual subject withdrawal : Patients replace withdrawal , first dose study medication . However , patient may replace withdrawal take place randomization administration first dose study medication ( example withdrawal first study day due claustrophobia ) . Follow-up subject withdraw treatment : Follow-up patient withdrawal do treat physicist ( general practitioner case ) . Immediately study withdrawal , treat physicist update patient 's condition laboratory result whether patient control group intervention group . Premature termination study : In case incidence three serious adverse event , study terminate prematurely independent committee ask investigate safety trial . Furthermore , investigator prematurely terminate study number subject withdraw study exceeds number use sample size calculation , i.e . 16 individual total . ADVERSE EVENTS , SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS SUSPECTED UNEXPECTED SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse event ( AEs ) : Adverse event define undesirable experience occur subject clinical trial , whether consider related used medication infuse drug . All adverse event report spontaneously subject observe investigator his/her staff record adverse event data collection form . The intensity adverse event grade investigator follow : - Mild : Discomfort note disruption normal daily activity - Moderate : Discomfort sufficient reduce affect normal daily activity - Severe : Inability work perform daily activity All adverse event actively query ask question : `` Have complaint since last time talked/met ? '' visit . All adverse event follow abate , stable situation reach . Depending event , follow may require additional test medical procedure indicate . The chronicity event classify investigator three-item scale define : - Single occasion : Single event limit duration - Intermittent Several episode event , limited duration - Persistent : Event remain indefinitely For adverse event , relationship use medication infuse drug ( definite , probable , possible , unknown , definitively ) judge investigator , record , well action undertaken relation adverse event , record . The occurrence adverse event fatal , life-threatening , disable require in-patient hospitalization , cause congenital anomaly , describe accord CHMP guideline ( suspect ) `` serious '' adverse event notify write Medical Ethics Committee . Furthermore , investigator copy Novo Nordisk expedite SARs SUSARs competent authority report SARs related Novo Nordisk product Novo Nordisk . The submission Novo Nordisk must however within day 15 investigator get knowledge valid case matter local timeline report authority . All pregnancy trial patient occur use Novo Nordisk product must report Novo Nordisk . Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) : A serious adverse event untoward medical occurrence effect dose : - result death ; - life threaten ( time event ) ; - require hospitalization prolongation exist inpatient ' hospitalization ; - result persistent significant disability incapacity ; - congenital anomaly birth defect ; - Any important medical event may result death , life threatening , require hospitalization , may consider serious adverse experience , base upon appropriate medical judgement , event may jeopardize subject may require intervention prevent one outcomes list . The sponsor report SAEs accredit METC approve protocol , within 15 day sponsor first knowledge serious adverse reaction . SAEs result death life threaten report expedite . The expedited reporting occur later 7 day responsible investigator first knowledge adverse reaction . This preliminary report another 8 day completion report . Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions ( SUSARs ) : Unexpected adverse reaction SUSARs follow three condition meet : 1. event must serious 2. must certain degree probability event harmful - undesirable reaction medicinal product investigation , regardless administer dose ; 3. adverse reaction must unexpected , say , nature severity adverse reaction agreement product information record : - Summary Product Characteristics ( SPC ) authorize medicinal product ; - Investigator 's Brochure unauthorized medicinal product . The sponsor report expedite SUSARs competent authority Member States , accord requirement Member States . The expedited reporting occur later 15 day sponsor first knowledge adverse reaction . For fatal life threaten case term maximal 7 day preliminary report another 8 day completion report . SAEs need report till end study within Netherlands , define protocol STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Primary secondary study parameter : The study endpoint analyze accord intention-to-treat principle . All endpoint parameter continuous variable . Data calculate mean SD , median ( percentile range ) accord nature distribution variable . Within group change baseline test independent pair t-test Wilcoxon signed-rank test . Between group difference compare 26 week Liraglutide control . Analysis perform SPSS . A 2-sided significance level p &lt; 0.05 apply . REGULATION STATEMENT The study conduct accord principle `` Declaration Helsinki '' ( amended Tokyo , Venice Hong Kong , Somerset West Edinburgh ) accordance Guideline Good Clinical Practice ( CPMP/ICH/135/95 - 17th July 1996 ) .
