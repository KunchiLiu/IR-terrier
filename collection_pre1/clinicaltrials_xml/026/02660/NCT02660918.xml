	<brief_title>Decreasing Postoperative Pain Following Endometrial Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Destruction endometrial line control bothersome uterine bleeding implement since 1937 . Currently various different 'second generation ' energy source avert bleeding , five approve United States . These 5 second generation device include : Thermachoice/Cavaterm , use high temperature fluid within balloon ; Microsulis , apply microwave ; Novasure , use bipolar energy ; Hydrothermablator , use free fluid high temperature ; ELITT , use laser thermotherapy ; HerOption , use cryoablation . Patient selection endometrial ablation crucial , intend premenopausal woman normal uterine cavity desire future fertility affect heavy menstrual bleeding . Since introduction initial 'second generation ' device 1997 modality overtake industry mostly due ease use shorter operative time . Regardless , Cochrane review find insufficient evidence prove superiority newer modality traditional 'gold standard ' resectoscopic technique . Endometrial ablation demonstrate variety setting include outpatient surgical center well physician 's office . Evidence suggest microwave endometrial ablation local anesthesia safe acceptable practice . Very often , endometrial ablation perform outpatient procedure , patient pre-medicated receive paracervical injection local anesthesia control pain intraoperatively . When endometrial ablation perform outpatient procedure surgical center , variety anesthesia technique employ depend infrastructure human institutional resource available . These technique may vary conscious sedation general anesthesia , proven acceptable method . In center endometrial ablation perform outpatient procedure general anesthesia variety induction technique intraoperative pain management practice . According physician preference , patient may receive additional paracervical injection local anesthetic procedure , immediately , . To date , study evaluate efficacy local anesthetic addition general anesthesia patient receive endometrial ablation guide physician practice . The purpose study evaluate efficacy local anesthetic , addition general anesthesia , large , community-based patient population , meaningfully decrease postoperative pain .</detailed_description>
