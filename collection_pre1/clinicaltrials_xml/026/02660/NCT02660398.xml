	<brief_summary>This prospective study take place Harborview Medical Center ( HMC ) University Washington Medical Center ( UWMC ) , enroll adult patient undergoing abdominal surgery . The purpose study identify use specific plan manage muscle relaxant help decrease risk muscle weakness general anesthesia muscle relaxation population patient undergoing abdominal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence Severity Residual Neuromuscular Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>80 patient enrol prospective study . The first 40 patient serve control intervention . Patients surgery receive general anesthesia often receive muscle relaxant call neuromuscular blocking drug NMBDs . NMBDs facilitate anesthesiologist ' performance tracheal intubation , provide muscle relaxation surgery , sometimes administer prevent movement . After surgery , anesthesiologist monitor muscle relaxant wear , give drug help reverse effect NMBDs tracheal breathe tube remove patient awaken take postoperative care area ( PACU ) . A patient receives NMBDs routine care experience leftover effect drug general anesthesia wear . This condition call Residual Neuromuscular Blockade . The management NMBDs patient routine care vary anesthesia provider . This study explore use specific plan manage muscle relaxant help decrease risk muscle weakness general anesthesia . Anesthesiologists routinely use peripheral nerve stimulators assess degree muscle relaxation . Very commonly series 4 electrical stimulation give 2 second stimulation result twitch thumb ulnar nerve stimulate wrist . This call train-of-four ( TOF ) monitoring . When patient deeply relaxed , twitches present drug effect diminishes time , twitch return . When 4 twitch present , exact measurement so-called TOF ratio calculate objective monitor use . The ratio strength fourth twitch divide strength first twitch . The commonly use reversal drug neostigmine know previous research work effectively muscle relaxation profound . In intervention group , investigator confirm neuromuscular blockade spontaneously recover level 4 thumb twitch present neostigmine administer . All patient objective measurement obtain use FDA approve monitor TOF-Watch SX . This monitor apply begin case calibrate immediately induction anesthesia . This simple automated process take less 1 minute . The investigator also obtain TOF ratio measurement begin case , muscle relaxant administer . This initial measurement allow normalization postoperative measurement . Measurement obtain time extubation , i.e . removal breathe tube , usually occur operate room patient awaken surgery . Patients routinely transfer post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) within minute extubated shortly arrival PACU , anesthesiologists transfer care PACU RNs . The investigator obtain one TOF-ratio measurement patient arrive post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) .</detailed_description>
