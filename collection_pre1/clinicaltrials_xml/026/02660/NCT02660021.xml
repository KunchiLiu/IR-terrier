	<brief_summary>Orthognathic surgery corrective jaw surgery indicate condition jaw face related structure growth malfunctioning , orthodontic problem , co-morbidities associate skeletal disfigurement . Imaging crucial assessment treatment plan orthognathic surgery patient . Until recently , two-dimensional ( 2D ) imaging , cephalometry , standard practice . However , show several limitation . The introduction cone-beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) enable three-dimensional ( 3D ) imaging cause paradigm shift . Though widespread implementation routine practice yet present . Our department one pioneer world 3D virtual treatment plan orthognathic surgery . The `` triple CBCT scan procedure '' develop in-house implement already 2009 . The investigator aim develop prospective database register 3D treatment planning data consecutive patient eligible orthognathic surgery , perform Prof. Swennen . Patient demographic , detail virtual 3D treatment planning parameter orthognathic surgery data collect consecutive visit within framework routine practice . Development database register 3D virtual treatment planning data orthognathic surgery , provide information potential patient , virtual planning surgical factor influence postoperative accuracy jaw correction , long-term stability jawbone , long-term condylar resorption , soft tissue response . In general , could provide answer research question examine prior study 2D-imaging , re-examined case 3D-imaging . Moreover , registration result could function measurement quality care , could use sample size calculation future large multicenter prospective trial .</brief_summary>
