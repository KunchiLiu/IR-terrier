	<brief_summary>Threonine indispensable amino acid , require human growth protein synthesis . Deficiency threonine affect small intestine growth due structural importance intestinal protein mucin . While Threonine find many food , deficiency occur develop country nutrition primarily plant base , low available protein . Ensuring dietary intake sufficient meet minimum threshold growth development important population health . Using new technique call Indicator Amino Acid Oxidation ( IAAO ) , threonine requirement determine school-aged child ( 6-10y ) . The study help determine minimum amount threonine need ensure dietary recommend guideline sufficient meet need population . Current dietary recommend intake 19 mg/kg-d population , base factorial calculation . Secondary aim determine metabolic availability threonine food . Protein isolate food source ( Casein , Soy protein , Pea protein ) use provide threonine place crystalline amino acid . The IAAO method use determine amount oxidation occur know quantity threonine food compare crystalline amino acid , regard 100 % available . The investigator hypothesize threonine requirement healthy child higher current dietary recommendation 19 mg/kg-d. Investigators also hypothesize Casein high metabolic availability either Soy protein isolate , Pea protein isolate .</brief_summary>
