	<brief_summary>The aim study ass effectiveness CRTH2 receptor antagonist , OC459 , prevent attenuate symptom asthma exacerbation rhinovirus infection . The study double blind , randomise trial half subject receive OC459 half placebo , inoculate rhinovirus , would normally induce worsen asthma symptom i.e . exacerbation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect OC459 Response Rhinovirus Challenge Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma common chronic respiratory disease , many country prevalence rise . The major morbidity , mortality health care cost related asthma result period acutely increase symptomatology call 'exacerbations ' . Most exacerbation cause rhinovirus , virus associated common cold . There treatment prevent treat exacerbation , despite &gt; 50 % adult asthmatic report exacerbation last year . There therefore major unmet need . Experimentally infect asthmatic rhinovirus , methodology safely use &gt; 15 year , induces asthma exacerbation ~85 % . This model offer possibility investigate treatment effect asthma exacerbation small number subject , minimise number expose novel drug limit safety data . In contrast , trial therapy power evaluate effect naturally occur exacerbation require several hundred subject , long study period capture enough event , significantly expensive carry . Using model investigator show several inflammatory molecule , include prostaglandin D2 ( PGD2 ) , significantly increase rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbation , level PGD2 strongly correlate severity symptom . Moreover study show PGD2 bind CRTH2 receptor , stimulate release number inflammatory molecule also associate asthma exacerbation . Blocking CRTH2 receptor therefore appear extremely promising target potential limit virus-induced inflammation underpin many asthma exacerbation .</detailed_description>
