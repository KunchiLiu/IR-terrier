	<brief_summary>Patients MRSaB high therapeutic failure rate mortality rate . Recent study show elevated IL-10 level independent risk factor mortality . It may also serve biomarker early risk stratification . The aim study compare outcomes patient elevate IL-10 level ( ≥8 pg/ml ) treat standard antibiotic therapy ( daptomycin vancomycin ) versus early aggressive therapy ( daptomycin ceftaroline ) treatment MRSaB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IL-10 Stratifying Tool Towards Antibiotic Selection MRSaB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients MRSaB primary therapeutic failure rate 40-50 % high mortality rate 10-50 % treat recommended standard antimicrobial therapy . ( Sharp ) local data MRSaB 2014 show all-cause mortality rate 29 % . Recent study publish utilize predictive biomarker , IL-10 , aid understanding wide variability mortality . Further study need elucidate clinical relevance utilize IL-10 level optimize MRSaB management whether patient outcomes enhance . Under current standard treatment strategy , vancomycin 15 mg/kg IVPB every 12 hr follow 30 mg/kg IVPB load dose first line antibiotic therapy initiate know suspected MRSaB . Only patient show unsatisfactory clinical response prolong bacteremia and/or continue clinical sign uncontrolled infection potent/aggressive expensive antibiotic choice consider case . Even time consideration switch matter controversy , current MRSA treatment guideline recommend switch 7-days failure . Several recent study show elevated IL-10 level independent risk factor mortality . In animal model , show bacterial cell wall Staphylococcus aureus stimulate production IL-10 . A small study Rose et al . show observation consistent human . In another study , author conclude elevate IL-10 time presentation predictive value mortality patient MRSaB4 . In addition , author conclude IL-10 may serve biomarker early risk stratification , selection standard therapy low-risk patient potent , expensive , cumbersome antibiotic therapy reserve high-risk patient . Furthermore , postulate treat high risk patient aggressive/intensified therapy earlier may improve economic microbiological outcome , decrease length treatment , decreased time Intensive Care Unit , decrease length stay hospital , decrease duration bacteremia . The aim study compare outcomes patient elevate IL-10 level ( ≥ 8 pg/mL ) treat standard antibiotic therapy versus early aggressive therapy treatment MRSaB . Aggressive therapy define study daptomycin ( 6-8mg/kg/day ) ceftaroline ( 600 mg q8hr ) .</detailed_description>
