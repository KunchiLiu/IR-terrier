	<detailed_description>It estimate 234.2 million major surgical procedure undertake every year worldwide . Surgery one major treatment method patient malignant tumor . And , alone age process , elderly patient undergo surgery malignant tumor . However , evidence emerges choice anesthetic , i.e. , either inhalational intravenous anesthetic , may influence outcome elderly patient undergo cancer surgery . A . Effects anesthetic immune function surgery The choice general anesthetic might influence human 's immune function surgery . An international multicenter team ( NCT00418457 ) investigate effect propofol-paravertebral anesthesia v sevoflurane-opioid anesthesia immune function patient breast cancer surgery . In small sample size ( n = 32 ) randomize control trail publish 2010 , postoperative serum concentration interleukin ( IL ) -1 ( protumorigenic cytokine ) matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) -3/9 ( associated cancer cell invasion metastasis ) significantly low ( P = 0.003 0.011 , respectively ) , whereas IL-10 ( antitumorigenic cytokine ) significantly high propofol group sevoflurane group ( P = 0.001 ) . In another small sample size ( n = 10 ) randomize control trail publish 2014 , serum obtain patient receive propofol anesthesia lead great human donor natural killer ( NK ) cell cytotoxicity vitro compare serum receive sevoflurane anesthesia . In recent small sample size ( n = 28 ) randomize control trial , level NK T helper cell infiltration breast cancer tissue significantly high patient receive propofol anesthesia receive sevoflurane anesthesia ( P = 0.015 0.03 , respectively ) . Similar finding report patient malignant tumor . In small randomized control trial , 30 patient non-small-cell lung cancer randomly receive either propofol isoflurane anesthesia . The result show cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+CD28+ percentage ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) ratio interferon-gamma : interleukin-4 ( P = 0.001 ) increase significantly propofol change isoflurane anesthesia ; indicate propofol promotes activation differentiation peripheral T-helper cell . In another randomized control trial , 60 patient undergoing surgery tongue cancer surgery randomly receive total propofol , mixed ( propofol induction sevoflurane maintenance ) anesthesia total sevoflurane anesthesia . The result show percentage CD3+ , CD3+CD4+ , NK cell ratio CD4+/CD8+ significantly decrease two sevoflurane group , total propofol group ; suggest propofol less effect cellular immune response sevoflurane . There also study report neutral result . The study suggest , compare inhalational anesthesia , propofol intravenous anesthesia may favorable effect immune function patient cancer surgery . However , care must take explain result : ( 1 ) sample size available study small ; ( 2 ) relationship postoperative immune function change long-term outcome remain unclear . B . Effects anesthetic invasiveness malignant tumor The effect anesthetic invasiveness tumor cell mainly test experimental study , i.e. , tumor cell incubate anesthetic vitro environment . In aspect , propofol show somewhat favorable effect . The result Miao et al . show propofol stimulation decrease expression MMP-2 -9 subsequently decrease invasive activity human colon cancer cell , possibly via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2 ) down-regulation mediate gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) -A receptor . The study Wang et al . report propofol inhibited invasion metastasis , enhance paclitaxel-induced apoptosis ovarian cancer cell , possibly suppress Slug expression . Ecimovic et al . also report propofol reduce migration estrogen receptor-positive -negative breast cancer cell , possibly suppress Neuroepithelial Cell Transforming Gene 1 ( NET1 ) expression . The reported effect various inhalational anesthetic conflict . Huang et al . compare effect propofol isoflurane prostate cancer cell . The result show propofol , clinical relevant concentration , inhibited activation hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) -1 alpha , partially reduce cancer cell malignant activity ; whereas isoflurane raise HIF-1 alpha expression , increase probability proliferation migration . The study Benaonana et al . report similar result , i.e. , isoflurane up-regulated expression HIFs , increase growth malignant potential renal cancer cell . On hand , sevoflurane desflurane show opposite effect . Multiple study find sevoflurane inhibit proliferation migration , induced apoptosis lung cancer cell . Müller-Edenborn et al . also report volatile anesthetic ( sevoflurane desflurane ) reduce invasion colorectal cancer cell down-regulation matrix metalloproteinase-9 . So far , clinical significance anesthetic invasiveness malignant tumor still lack . C. Effect anesthetics long-term outcome cancer surgery Studies aspect limit . In study Enlund et al. , 2838 patient underwent breast cancer colorectal cancer surgery retrospectively analyze , among 1935 receive sevoflurane anesthesia 903 propofol anesthesia . The 1-year 5-year survival rate higher propofol-anesthetized patient sevoflurane-anesthetized one ( difference overall survival rate 4.7 % , P = 0.004 5.6 % , P &lt; 0.001 , respectively ) . However , difference statistically significant adjust confound factor . In recent study , Wigmore et al . retrospectively investigated 11,395 patient cancer surgery . After exclusion propensity matching , 2,607 patient remain inhalational anesthesia group total intravenous anesthesia group . The result show , median follow-up duration 2.66 year ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 2.62-2.69 ) , volatile inhalational anesthesia associate high risk death univariate ( HR 1.59 , 95 % CI 1.30-1.95 ) multivariable analysis ( HR 1.46 , 95 % CI 1.29-1.66 ) . However , aspect , long-term follow-up result randomize controlled trial still lack . Prospective study explore effect anesthetic choice long-term survival cancer surgery patient urgently need .</detailed_description>
