	<brief_title>Exacerbations Severe Asthma Patients : Mechanisms Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit Severe Asthma Clinics Royal Brompton Hospital . At first visit investigator enrol characterise patient . This involve ask patient keep diary record PEFR ( Peak Expiratory Flow Rate ) , spirometry , symptom score , use beta-agonist reliever treatment 2 week . Bloods test take marker systemic inflammation . Markers oxidative stress measure blood , exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) urine : malondialdehyde ( MDA ) 8-isoprostanes . Nitric oxide ( NO ) level exhale breath measure measured twice daily 2 week use portable hand-held NO meter . If spontaneous sputum available , sputum induce use ultrasonic nebulization isotonic saline . Profile inflammatory cell , cytokine supernatant , bacteriological culture microbiome analysis measure sputum . Patients observe 12 month time number exacerbation record basis objective measure evaluation ACQ ( Asthma Control Questionnaire ) , daily morning evening PEF ( Peak Expiratory Flow ) . At early onset exacerbation , patient request contact Asthma Research Unit . Patients ask attend laboratory similar test first visit perform . For exacerbation study , patient ask keep detailed diary record symptom severity score spirometric PEF measurement ( Exacerbation Diary ) period 2 week onset exacerbation . As patient severe asthma usually well experienced symptom exacerbation , therefore ask recognise exacerbation . Each patient way recognise exacerbation investigator discuss patient try establish whether early warn signal possible . Patients ask record symptom lung function soon feel onset exacerbation , since exacerbation recognise patient event 'clinically identify outside patient 's usual range day-to-day variation ' . The patient receive administer treatment exacerbation usual without interference Research Team except start antibiotic therapy , start ( prescribe ) soon visit study complete . Those hospitalized study , attend Clinical Research Unit study .</detailed_description>
