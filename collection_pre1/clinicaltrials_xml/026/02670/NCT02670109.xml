	<brief_summary>Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) refers breast cancer express estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) Her2/neu . Its incidence approximately 180,000 case per year . TNBC known aggressive poor prognosis specially pathologic complete response ( pCR ) achieve neoadjuvant chemotherapy , high risk recurrence poor survival recurrence occur . On hand , specific adjuvant neoadjuvant treatment patient . Since autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) allow usage high dos chemotherapy , result high cellular destruction decrease hematological toxicity , propose procedure able improve prognosis TNBC patient pathologic complete response neoadjuvant chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Adjuvant Treatment Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) account approximately 15 % -25 % breast cancer case . TNBC usually high-grade tumor , present among young woman , African American Hispanic woman high risk ; generally advance stage diagnose , visceral recurrence ( liver , lung , brain ) . Standard treatment surgery adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy . As variation , neoadjuvant chemotherapy frequently use triple-negative breast cancer , however , lack specific agent subset patient , , pathologic complete response correlate overall survival . At moment , optimal chemotherapy exist TNBC patient achieve pCR . According German group , triple negative subset , 31 % patient neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieve pathologic complete response ( pCR ) , correlate progression free survival ( HR 6.02 achieve pCR ) , overall survival ( HR 12.41 achieve pCR ) . The usage high-dose chemotherapy autologous HSCT , one therapy study patient localize breast cancer aim improve outcome . Autologous HSCT allow high chemotherapy dos , result higher tumor cell destruction . Since 1980 , several phase II study perform high-dose chemotherapy autologous HSCT , apparently initial benefit , thus strategy widely use outside controlled clinical trial . Afterward , randomize study show benefit overall survival , cause strategy abandon . It important highlight study heterogeneity mean different treatment option experimental control group , besides , advance autologous HSCT significantly reduce complexity , mobility , mortality relate chemotherapy treatment . Two published study include patient localized TNBC , show benefit progression free survival high-dose chemotherapy group , tendency improve overall survival . One performed german group , include patient least 9 positive node , randomize receive two cycle conventional dose chemotherapy follow two cycle high-dose chemotherapy autologous HSCT versus four cycle conventional dose chemotherapy follow three cycle dense dose chemotherapy , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) administration . Progression free survival 76 month group high dose chemotherapy versus 40.6 month conventional chemotherapy group , overall survival 60 versus 44 % , statistically significant . Our hypothesis patient TNBC high risk recurrence ( pCR ) undergo high-dose chemotherapy follow autologous HSCT high overall survival compare undergo mention treatment .</detailed_description>
