	<brief_summary>Few persistent wound often remain even successful hematopoietic cell transplantation systemic genodermatosis epidermolysis bullosa ( EB ) . The investigator propose local wound therapy use epidermal skin graft donor provide hematopoietic graft , EB individual mosaic ( naturally gene correct ) skin . In case permissive immune system skin chimerism expect enable long-term epidermal engraftment wound heal . The investigator use FDA approve vacuum device ( CelluTome® , Regulation number 878.4820 ) enable painless , bloodless scar-free harvesting epidermis transfer square surgical tape ( Tegaderm® ) recipient wound dress .</brief_summary>
