	<brief_title>Safety Study CN-105 Neuroprotective Peptide Intracerebral Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) , often associate longstanding hypertension , affect many 50,000 people annually United States alone . ICH remain associated poor outcome , approximately 40 50 % afflicted patient die within 30 day . Unfortunately , little improvement make ICH-associated mortality rate last 20 year . To address issue , National Institutes Health issue priority report 2005 , American Heart Association release recent set clinical guideline first time nearly decade . In report , importance develop clinically relevant model ICH extend understand pathophysiology disease target new therapeutic approach emphasize . At present , however , proven neuroprotective pharmacological treatment ICH form acute brain injury , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) . To meet unmet medical need , CereNova , LLC develop novel therapeutic approach base known biological function endogenous apolipoprotein E ( apoE ) , key mediator neuroinflammatory response recovery variety acute chronic brain injuries1-5 . There three common human isoforms apolipoprotein E , designate apoE2 , apoE3 , apoE4 , differ single cysteine arginine substitution position 112 158 . Although originally define context cholesterol metabolism , apoE also produce brain , modulate neuroinflammatory response functional outcome injury isoform specific fashion1 . Specifically , apoE3 protein isoform play adaptive role downregulating glial activation reduce secondary neuronal injury , whereas E4 isoform associate increased neuroinflammation poor functional outcome . Although intact apoE holoprotein cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) thus administer therapeutically , previously demonstrate small apoE mimetic peptide effectively cross BBB effectively downregulating brain inflammatory response vitro vivo6 . CN-105 , CereNova 's lead clinical candidate , small , 5 amino acid apoE-mimetic peptide derive receptor bind region apoE . CN-105 retain anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effect intact apoE , well tolerated preclinical study , readily cross BBB effectively reduce inflammatory response brain .</detailed_description>
