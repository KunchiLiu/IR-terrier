	<detailed_description>Subjects AS , RTT PWS normal sibling ( control ) recruit study participation . Subjects recruit Rare Disease Clinical Research Network ( RDCRN ) consortium registry AS , RTT PWS . The RDCRN registry provide listing individual currently enrol RDCRN along clinical genetic diagnosis , medical history contact information . The RDCRN consortium sit AS , RTT PWS participate study . These site recruit study participant , obtain informed consent administer sleep questionnaire . Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval obtain RDCRN consortium site . `` Subjects '' define child diagnosis AS , PWS , RTT . Subjects divide separate study arm base upon medical diagnosis . Study arm consist : 1 ) AS group , 2 ) PWS group , 3 ) RTT group , 4 ) control group . `` Control group '' define normal healthy sibling subject . Study participant parents/guardians ask complete study questionnaire clinic visit . The questionnaire brief difficult complete . It anticipate questionnaire complete 15-30 minute . If parent unable complete questionnaire time schedule clinic visit ask take questionnaire home complete mail back research team . When research team receives return questionnaire review completion . If question skip left blank , member research team call family complete miss question phone . Parents/guardians allow answer question behalf study participant ask answer question age-appropriate questionnaire order response score correctly . Subjects AS , RTT PWS normal sibling complete questionnaire form . Study participant administer questionnaire 12-24 month follow-up RDCRN clinic visit mail assess natural history sleep behavior sleep disorder . Study participant identify potential severe sleep disorder base questionnaire response contact sent letter study investigator advise see sleep specialist evaluation . Potential `` Subjects '' must member RDCRN consortium registry available contact clinical diagnostic information file . These individual invite participate study next regularly schedule RDCRN visit . Study recruitment continue one year . Subjects clinical diagnosis AS , RTT PWS , normal sibling individual recruit study participation . The sample size study participant , include control , base upon number individual currently enrol RDCRN consortium registry . Currently combine number individual AS , RTT PWS RDCRN consortium registry 1082 . The breakdown disorder : 678 RTT , 172 AS , 141 PWS . Final sample size total number subject consent one year recruitment period . A projected enrollment total would approximately 1,000 total individual ( 500 subject include 300 RTT , 100 AS , 100 PWS &amp; 500 control ) .</detailed_description>
