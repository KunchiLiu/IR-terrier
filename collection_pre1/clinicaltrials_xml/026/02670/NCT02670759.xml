	<brief_summary>This study design ass : - The impact continuous thoracic paravertebral nerve blockade compare intercostal nerve blockade intensity postoperative pain follow VATS subject Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) device primary analgesic modality . - The impact continuous thoracic paravertebral analgesia length stay , opioid intake , respiratory function , incidence side-effects postoperative complication . The basic hypothesis study continuous thoracic paravertebral nerve blockade provide superior postoperative analgesia follow VATS compare intercostal nerve blockade patient PCA device primary analgesic modality . Superior quality analgesia contribute preserve pulmonary function , reduce opioid intake relate side-effects shorten hospital stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Appropriate postoperative analgesia crucial fast-track surgery , multimodal therapeutic strategy aim toward enhance postoperative recovery shorten hospital stay . Although VATS consider minimally invasive procedure , patient report moderate severe pain variable duration follow surgery . The ideal postoperative analgesia regimen VATS elucidate . Systemic opioids give patient-controlled device ( PCA ) routinely used procedure analgesic effect limit undesirable side-effects may occur . Intercostal nerve blockade also widely use alleviate pain follow VATS use adjunct systemic opioids . Paravertebral nerve blockade interesting alternative analgesia follow VATS . The duration pain relief associate paravertebral nerve blockade may vary 4 48 hour . However , duration analgesic effect prolong use continuous infusion local anesthetic . This study compare efficacy continuous ambulatory paravertebral analgesia intercostal analgesia . All patient PCA device primary analgesic modality . Methods : Seventy patient randomize receive either continuous paravertebral analgesia intercostal analgesia . Anesthetic technique monitoring standardize . On arrival recovery room , patient PCA device instal . PCA dose standardize . All patient also receive acetaminophen non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) co-analgesia . PCA remove 24 hour surgery oral opioids administer need . From arrival recovery room , patient paravertebral analgesia group administer bupivacaine 0.0625 % infusion conventional infusion pump rate 10 mL/h . Before discharge hospital day follow surgery late morning second day , bupivacaine infusion transfer portable elastomeric pump . The infusion continue next 30 hour rate 10 mL/h . During first 72 hour follow surgery , follow information record : intensity pain , opioid intake , side-effects attributable analgesia patient 's level satisfaction towards pain management . The occurence pulmonary complication note . Lung function measure use peak flow meter . Length stay recovery room , intermediate intensive care unit hospital record . Time reach post-anesthesia discharge criterion record . Patients contact telephone 2 time day hospital discharge occur 72 hour surgery assess level pain analgesic intake , presence side-effects complication satisfaction level towards pain management . This trial also include sub-study performed ten human cadaver . The goal sub-study assess impact orientation bevel paravertebral block needle ease insertion position paravertebral catheter use ultrasound imaging .</detailed_description>
