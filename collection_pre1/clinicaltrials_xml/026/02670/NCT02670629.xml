	<brief_summary>This fracture manage anatomical reduction perform anesthesia use sedative . In institution mean prolong hospital stay , involvement anesthesiologist use special room Emergency Department . This research protocol bear report publish regard leave fracture override position cast good functional acceptable radiographical result ; say study observational , provide valuable limited information treatment option . On hand , study randomize control trial group patient young 11 year old present Emergency Department completely displace distal radius fracture , randomly assign one two group , either close anatomic reduction short cast close override alignment short cast .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Distal radius fracture represent 40 % fracture pediatric patient , common mechanism simple fall hand wrist extension . The standard treatment kind fracture close anatomical reduction place short arm cast 6 week , weekly follow-up pay close attention re-displacement consolidation data . This fracture acceptable deformity angle anatomical reduction 15ยบ coronal sagittal plane ; order perform reduction , patient subject sedation strict monitorization , either Emergency Department Surgical Room . In case , patient must stay hospital least 3 hour procedure perform , order discharge analgesic appropriate indication care cast home . Distal radius fracture pediatric patient manage anatomical reduction perform anesthesia use sedative . In institution mean prolong hospital stay , involvement anesthesiologist use aa special room Emergency Department . This research protocol bear report publish regard leave fracture override position cast good functional acceptable radiographical result ; say study observational , provide valuable limited information treatment option . On hand , study randomize control trial group patient young 11 year old present Emergency Department completely displace distal radius fracture , randomly assign one two group , either close anatomic reduction short cast close override alignment short cast . Recent study suggest alternative option patient , instead perform complete reduction , gentle maneuver do order get partial alignment override fracture , strict follow-up cooperative patient , method show good result term consolidation deformity angle . The new procedure perform without anesthesia , instead non-steroid antiinflammatory analgesic give patient , give possibility early discharge . The possibility leave patient override position good result related recent study bone pediatric patient , especially young 14 year old . The published observation presume fracture consolidation remodel potential give physis presence persistence throughout year . Even importantly , know distal radius predominantly form trabecular bone thicker periosteum , condition confer bone high consolidation rate rapid remodeling , leave permanent deformity reinterventions rather rare situation . In term aesthetic deformity , 20ยบ radiological deformity plane require leave clinically visible deformity , even , 35ยบ need cause functional impairment .</detailed_description>
