	<brief_summary>The long-term goal study optimize perioperative care pediatric spinal deformity patient , minimize perioperative complication increase cost-effectiveness perioperative hematologic management . The objective propose study , initial step pursuit goal , evaluate effectiveness thromboelastography ( TEG ) monitor coagulation pathway direct blood product replacement pediatric neuromuscular spinal deformity surgery . The central hypothesis study TEG decrease exposure allogeneic pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) . The rationale proven effectiveness TEG neuromuscular deformity may change standard care hematologic management neuromuscular spinal deformity case additionally set stage multicenter trial idiopathic pediatric deformity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To achieve aim study , investigator perform randomize clinical trial compare thromboelastography standard intraoperative monitoring coagulation pathways pediatric neuromuscular deformity surgery . All patient receive standard care hematological management , include intravenous tranexamic acid ( 50mg/kg load bolus , 5mg/kg/hr infusion wound closure ) surgery . Patients randomized TEG group receive standard care plus TEG test four time point : time incision , completion surgical exposure , completion instrumentation , upon arrival PACU . TEG result use guide fluid replacement , form platelet , fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , tranexamic acid accord previously publish protocols9 . Data collect include standard preoperative demographic data : gender , age , body mass index , diagnosis ; standard spinal deformity radiographic measurement ; surgical data include operative time , estimate blood loss , blood product replacement . The international normalized ratio ( INR ) obtain wound closure , along complete blood count , group per standard care . Postoperative data point collect include allogeneic packed red cell transfusion volume , drain output ( drain discontinue postoperative day # 3 ) , time normal feeding ( either home feeding tube rate normal per o diet ) , time discharge . Perioperative complication collect categorized accord Glassman et al . Cost data related hospital stay care perioperative complication data record . These include cost related antibiotic , length stay ( include prolong intensive care unit stay ) , perioperative transfusion requirement . To approximate cost related transfusion , investigator include cost acquisition , storage , administration . Similar cost related blood product administration collect assign need . The investigator anticipate patient report quality life score similar group . As may case , investigator collect quality adjust life year ( QALY ) data ACEND survey . These data collect preoperative visit 6 , 12 , 24 month followup point .</detailed_description>
