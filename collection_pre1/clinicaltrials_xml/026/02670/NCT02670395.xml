	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , single-center , first-in-human study consist 2 part : ) Single Ascending Dose part b ) PK-Food Effect part . Part 1 randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither Investigator participant know treatment ) , sequential cohort , single ascend oral dose study . Part 1 ass safety , tolerability , PK single ascend dos JNJ-54416076 healthy male participant . It consist 8 cohort 8 healthy participant . Within cohort , 6 participant randomly assign JNJ-54416076 treatment , 2 participant randomly assign placebo treatment . The total study duration participant Part 1 approximately 5 week . Part 2 randomized , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , 2-period crossover study . Part 2 assess effect food pharmacokinetics JNJ-54416076 . Each participant Part 2 receive 2 dos JNJ-54416076 ( one dose fast state identical dose feed state ) . The dose select Part 2 select base preliminary safety PK data Part 1 . The total study duration participant Part 2 approximately 7 week . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
