Because investigator interested ascertain effect specific intervention specific/single outcome , study well-suited approach . The investigator conduct iterative single case experimental study use randomization test . This design help evaluate technology behavior change . To increase statistical power , investigator opt conduct ABA study design ( also term reversal design ) A baseline B intervention . Using randomization test , length A B phase determine vary randomly length prior begin participant 's experiment . The investigator constrain total time A B phase last minimum 5 day provide adequate exposure A ( measurement ) B ( intervention ) condition . The maximum total number day participant enrol 28 .</detailed_description>
