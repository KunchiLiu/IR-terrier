	<brief_summary>Hypertension aortic stenosis two leading condition cause thicken heart muscle ( leave ventricular hypertrophy ) . Left ventricular hypertrophy initially adaptive maintain optimal heart function . Ultimately , heart failure occur result progressive muscle cell death scarring ( myocardial fibrosis ) . Dedicated technique use cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin blood assay potential marker detect myocardial fibrosis . Although hypertension-related heart disease common Singapore , significance myocardial fibrosis well understood . In study , significance myocardial fibrosis 500 patient hypertension would investigate . This large study use state-of-the-art MRI examine importance myocardial fibrosis hypertensive heart disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According National Health Survey 2010 , 50 % adults 60-69 year old Singapore hypertension . As population age life expectancy continue increase , increase incidence hypertensive heart disease would expect . Similar aortic stenosis , leave ventricular hypertrophy patient hypertension associate adverse cardiovascular outcome , independent traditional risk factor include peripheral blood pressure . Unlike aortic stenosis ( condition fix obstruction ) , arterial hypertension dynamic effective medical therapy , leave ventricular hypertrophy regress outcome improve . As , contemporary guideline recommend aggressive blood pressure control patient hypertension leave ventricular hypertrophy . However , correlation arterial pressure leave ventricular mass weak , particularly treated individual . Coupled inherent limitation measure peripheral blood pressure , clear use arterial pressure monitor progression ass treatment response patient hypertensive heart disease optimal . Without timely appropriate therapy , leave ventricular hypertrophy become progressively maladaptive ultimately heart fail . Whilst heart failure commonly know sign symptom relate impaired systolic ejection fraction , heart failure preserve ejection fraction increasingly recognize complex entity characterize sign symptom heart failure presence preserve ejection fraction . To date , therapy improve outcome heart failure reduce ejection fraction show similar benefit patient heart failure preserve ejection fraction . There single explanation negative finding , one potential reason may relate heterogeneity patient recruited trial , thus support target approach specific phenotypes rather standard treatment strategy patient . Therefore , focus transition compensatory leave ventricular hypertrophy ventricular decompensation crucial furthering understand pathophysiology hypertensive heart disease , also instrumental design future trial . Small study report replacement myocardial fibrosis patient hypertension . But study small unable establish determinant associate myocardial fibrosis . Unlike increase evidence myocardial fibrosis aortic stenosis , prognosis associate myocardial fibrosis patient hypertension currently know . Although promising data suggest regression myocardial fibrosis certain antihypertensive therapy , effect myocardial fibrosis regression long-term outcome know . As discuss earlier , rely peripheral blood pressure , biomarkers monitor response antihypertensive therapy regression leave ventricular mass myocardial fibrosis . Our investigator would establish paradigm demonstrate significance myocardial fibrosis hypertensive heart disease ; examine biomarkers associate myocardial fibrosis myocyte death high potential translate clinical application monitor treatment response .</detailed_description>
