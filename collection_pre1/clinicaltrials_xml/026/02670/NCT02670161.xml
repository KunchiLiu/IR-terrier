	<brief_title>Quality Improvement Practice Based Research Neurology Using EMR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal propose research advance quality improvement practice base research Neurology use electronic medical record ( EMR ) . The American Academy Neurology ( AAN ) publish evidence-based guideline , quality improvement measure , resource several neurological disorder . However , AAN guideline measure implement routinely benchmark data lack . There EMR tool available standardize neurology office visit accord Best Practices , provide alert neurological care deviate AAN guideline , capture data regard adherence AAN quality parameter , measure effect compliance guideline outcomes , share longitudinal data compare effectiveness care across neurological practice . The Department Neurology NorthShore University HealthSystem ( NorthShore ) build commercial EMR `` Epic '' structure clinical documentation support ( SCDS ) clinical decision support ( CDS ) tool standardize care , write progress note , capture 1,000 discrete cascade field neurological data per office visit . However , EMR tool disseminate use Neurology practice data sharing , presently support clinical trial . Pragmatic trial use EMRs would enable comparison treatment point care . To address gap quality improvement practice base research Neurology , investigator propose Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) project specific aim : 1 ) To create Neurology Practice Based Research Network ( NPBRN ) . The NorthShore site share SCDS CDS tool 10 common neurological disorder ( brain tumor , epilepsy , migraine , mild cognitive impairment , mild traumatic brain injury , multiple sclerosis , neuropathy , Parkinson 's disease , restless legs syndrome , stroke ) seven Department Neurology also use Epic EMR platform ( eight site total ) . 2 ) To conduct NorthShore pragmatic trial use EMR 10 common neurological disorder . The investigator demonstrate feasibility subgroup base adaptive assignment treatment , electronic consenting , outcomes data capture point care use EMR . They identify effective treatment common neurological disorder seek replication NPBRN . The aim innovative investigator use EMR hardwire quality outcomes research Neurology . They individualize medicine point care conduct pragmatic trial use subgroup base adaptive design , compare effectiveness available treatment common neurological disorder . The aim significant study several neurological disorder , lead cause healthcare burden worldwide . They create national practice base network improve health care quality accelerate implementation patient-centered outcome research Neurology use EMR , evidence make health care safer improve health care efficiency . NOTE : This ClinicalTrials.gov registration relate Aim 2 project ( pragmatic trial use EMR ) . Aim 1 observational study ( quality improvement , comparative effectiveness research ) .</detailed_description>
