	<brief_summary>It well-known breastfeed protects infant illness , especially poor region world . The full nature protective effect , however , less well understood . A major barrier understand fact almost nothing known factor influence considerable variation milk composition around globe , effect variation infant health . This INSPIRE project represent first comprehensive investigation global difference human milk composition along various microbial , evolutionary , environmental , sociocultural factor might influence milk composition infant health . An international , interdisciplinary collaboration physiologist , nutritional scientist , anthropologist , microbiologist , mathematician collect biological data breastfeed woman infant , concert extensive anthropologic ecological data , develop ( US , Spain , Sweden ) develop country ( Central African Republic , Gambia , Ghana , Peru , Kenya ) . To test possibility correlation milk oligosaccharide composition , milk microbiota , gastrointestinal microbiome infant , milk sample infant fecal sample analyze use state-of-the-art biochemical genomic technique . This study allow important cross-cultural comparison milk composition infant feeding practice ; also utilize sophisticated computational method integrate extensive , diverse body combine biological anthropological data elucidate relationship among sociocultural factor , evolutionary history , environmental exposure , microbial constituent milk composition . The researcher predict consider `` normal '' milk composition one population may support optimal health another . This information crucial humanitarian quest understand infant nutrition overall health improve around world . In addition , project provide extensive research training opportunity undergraduate , graduate postdoctoral scientist .</brief_summary>
