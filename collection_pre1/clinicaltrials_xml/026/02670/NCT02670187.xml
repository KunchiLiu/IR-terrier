	<brief_summary>The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS CoV ) , virus relate Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS CoV ) , first recognize cause severe pulmonary infection 2012 . Infection MERS CoV diagnose 1600 individual mortality rate 35 % 40 % . GLS-5300 DNA plasmid vaccine express MERS CoV spike ( S ) glycoprotein . This study evaluate safety GLS-5300 one three dose level follow three-injection vaccination regimen follow electroporation . The study also assess immune response 1 year period respect generation antibody cellular response .</brief_summary>
