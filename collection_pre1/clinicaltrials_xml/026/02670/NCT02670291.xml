	<brief_summary>This randomize , sham-controlled , double blind , multicentre clinical trial aim provide evidence efficacy safety continuous theta burst stimulation ( cTBS ) treatment auditory hallucination patient schizophrenia . Overall , study include 86 patient . Each patient receive three week course daily ( 5/week ) treatment ; 50 % patient treat cTBS ( 1200 impulse daily ) , half sham stimulation leave right temporoparietal cortex . Sham stimulation apply active sham-coil allow double-blind treatment . Follow-up assessment 1 , 3 6 month treatment investigate stability treatment effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Auditory Hallucinations Schizophrenia With Bilateral Theta Burst Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Auditory verbal hallucination ( AH ) , cardinal feature schizophrenia , often severely distress increase risk violence suicide . Although antipsychotic medication mostly exert rapid beneficial effect symptom particularly first-episode patient continue take medication ( Sommer et al . 2012 ) , 25 % -30 % patient , hallucination persist ( Shergill et al . 1998 ) . The often progressive course disease insufficient treatment adherence due unwanted side effect significantly limit treatment response . In turn , lack treatment efficacy also contribute low treatment adherence generally associate unfavorable course schizophrenia increase relapse readmission rate . New effective treatment therefore essential reduce massive individual burden psychosocial cost associate schizophrenia . Nevertheless , last decade , hop new pharmacological treatment option disappointed pharmaceutical industry apparently withdraw development new compound disorder . Accordingly , development non-pharmacological approach base increase body patho-physiological knowledge even need pave new way treatment frequently detrimental symptom schizophrenia . The main objective present study provide high-level evidence efficacy safety continuous theta burst stimulation ( cTBS ) treatment auditory hallucination ( AH ) first full-size multicenter ( 3 center ) control clinical trial . This double blind ( actually triple blind , i.e . patient , clinical investigator , person administer cTBS ) , randomize , sham-controlled clinical trial test efficacy safety bilateral ( successively apply ) daily cTBS temporoparietal cortex severity AH . The study conduct two-armed parallel design 50 % ( n = 23 ) patient treat verum stimulation half ( n = 23 ) patient receive placebo / sham stimulation . The cTBS protocol follow method Huang et al . ( 2005 ) pilot study ( Plewnia et al . 2014a ) achieve last reduction cortical excitability . Accordingly , stimulation train ( 40 ) cTBS consist 600 stimulus apply burst 3 pulse 50 Hz give every 200 m ( 5 Hz ) . Stimulation intensity standardize 80 % rest motor threshold ( RMT ) apply successively hemisphere alternate order , counterbalance across session patient . The RMT determine use EMG recording leave right abductor pollicis brevis define minimal stimulation intensity need elicit least 10 20 motor-evoked-potentials ≥ 50µV . RMT re-evaluated adapt begin week treatment . The cTBS sham treatment target temporoparietal cortex halfway T3/P3 T4/P4 ( EEG 10/20 system ) . The treatment ( active cTBS sham cTBS ) administer period 3 consecutive week workday ( Monday Friday ) , result total 15 treatment session . Ratings perform last treatment week independent rater . Follow-up visit plan 1 , 3 6 month end treatment phase control sustainability cTBS treatment effect .</detailed_description>
