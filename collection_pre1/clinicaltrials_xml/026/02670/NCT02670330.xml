	<detailed_description>Epidermolysis Bullosa ( EB ) rare group inherit disorder typically manifest birth blister lesion formation skin , case , epithelial lining organ , response little apparent trauma . In consequence , skin extremely fragile result shear skin , cause high risk infection . All form EB debilitate life threaten . In EB subtypes , high mortality occur age 1 ( Junctional Herlitz ) , others adolescence early adulthood , typically due infection failure thrive . In addition , child survive 20 's 30 's also risk development virulent form squamous cell carcinoma , many case fatal . There standard care product available treat dermal manifestation EB , approve drug EB either Europe United States . There numerous study publish potential treatment skin manifestation associate EB , include vitamin E therapy , systemic phenytoin , topical nonsteroidal agent , cyproheptadine , tetracycline , dapsone . No controlled study show clinical benefit therapy . Newer exploratory treatment include skin graft , bioengineered skin product , gene therapy unsuccessful date . This open label , multi-center extension study ass long-term safety topically applied ZORBLISA patient Simplex , Recessive Dystrophic , Junctional non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa . ZORBLISA apply topically , day , entire body period 1440 day . Patients successfully complete study SD-005 ( study drug Visit 5 ) option roll SD-006 study . The baseline visit ( Visit 1 ) occur Visit 5 SD-005 . The Body Surface Area ( BSA ) assessments lesional skin wound burden perform Visit 5 SD-005 utilized baseline assessment SD-006 . Patients return follow-up visit month 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 ,12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 27 , 30 , 33 , 36 , 39 , 42 , 48 Visit 1 . At visit , assessment include BSA lesional skin wound burden . For target wound close end Study SD-005 , ARANZ picture calculation target wound area final visit Study SD-005 use baseline area size target wound SD-006 . These unhealed target wound SD-005 assessed via ARANZ subsequent schedule visit target wound document close . Closed wound assess scarring .</detailed_description>
