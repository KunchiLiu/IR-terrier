	<brief_summary>EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma EBV-mediated oncogenic signal pathway activation , multiple intracellular pathway potential therapeutic target disorder . Thus , EBV-associated protein , LMP1 induce activation various downstream pathway molecule PI3K/Akt NF-kB activation . The activation NF-kB one essential factor contribute prolonged survival aggressive phenotype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . In aggressive subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , activate B-cell like type , chronic active B-cell receptor signal MYD88 mutation know stimulate NF-kB transcription activation . As result , key molecule mediate B-cell receptor signal pathway , Bruton tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) critical role , BTK emerge therapeutic target diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Considering close association B-cell receptor signal pathway PI3K/Akt pathway diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , target BTK might helpful improve treatment outcome EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Ibrutinib , BTK inhibitor activity B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma via target B-cell receptor signal pathway . As result , evidence antitumor- effect Ibrutinib accumulate several type B-cell lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma . Given EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma know poor response treatment compare diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , otherwise specify ( NOS ) , addition ibrutinib standard chemotherapy regimen , rituximab-CHOP may provide benefit patient .</brief_summary>
