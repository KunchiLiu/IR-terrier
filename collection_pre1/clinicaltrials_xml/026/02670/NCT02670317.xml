	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , single arm , phase II trial young patient ( 18-60 year ) poor-prognosis ( age-adjusted International Prognostic Index , aaIPI , 2 3 ) newly diagnose Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . Patient receive 6 course G-CHOP21 ( Obimutizumab- cyclophosphamide , hydroxydaunomycin , Oncovin , prednisone ) follow 2 dos Obinutuzumab supplement Ibrutinib . Duration treatment 5 month plus 4-5 week response evaluation . During study , disease status evaluate 4th cycle compute tomography ( CT ) scan , end treatment image test ( 18FDG-PET [ positron emission tomography ] CT scan ) . Patients recruit 2 year follow minimum 2 year end treatment phase .</detailed_description>
