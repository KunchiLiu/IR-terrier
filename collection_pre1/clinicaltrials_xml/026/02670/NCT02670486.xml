	<brief_summary>Many woman need run restroom frequently night day , condition call `` overactive bladder '' . Embarrassing urinary leakage also commonly associate symptom . The investigator believe primary cause case bladder muscle contracting frequently still sure exactly happen triggered factor environment . When bladder test use pressure catheter ( `` urodynamics '' ) do bladder contraction often pick , even woman overactive bladder . This may partly due unnatural environment test do without presence usual visual audible trigger , run water see toilet . The investigator propose add audiovisual stimulant usual bladder test see make likely bladder contraction happen . One group patient would usual bladder test part normal care . The group would receive normal care addition hearing water fountain room watch video thing may trigger overactive bladder symptom ; see public restroom sign mall , toilet bowl lower kitchen sink water run dish . The suspicion proportion patient bladder contraction see high audiovisual trigger compare usual care . Women overactive bladder leakage urge send urodynamics doctor ask wish participate study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Audiovisual Stimulus During Urodynamics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detrusor overactivity ( DO ) , define rise detrusor pressure bladder fill urodynamic evaluation ( UDE ) , presume involved pathophysiology overactive bladder syndrome ( OAB ) urge urinary incontinence ( UUI ) . However , mechanism DO fully understand detection rate DO UDE low . Currently limit data literature investigate audiovisual stimulation DO . To improve understand neural regulation micturition , investigator propose add audiovisual stimulant standard UDE . Methods : 218 woman OAB and/or UUI undergo UDE recruit . Subjects randomize standard care versus standard care addition audiovisual stimulant , involve patient listen running water watch video several well-known trigger . The primary outcome proportion patient detrusor contraction see . Secondary outcome include number , amplitude length contraction presence incontinence associate contraction . The objective study estimate effect add audiovisual cue UDE proportion patient DO detect compare standard clinical care . The hypothesis proportion patient detrusor contraction see high female patient OAB symptom and/or UUI use audiovisual stimulant . Data obtain analyzed chi square , t-tests , multivariable logistic regression analysis appropriate .</detailed_description>
