	<brief_summary>Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis ( LCH ) type cancer damage tissue cause lesion form one place body . Langerhans cell histiocytosis ( LCH ) cancer begin LCH cell ( type dendritic cell fight infection ) . Sometimes mutation ( change ) LCH cell form . These include mutation BRAF gene . These change may make LCH cell grow multiply quickly . This cause LCH cell build certain part body , damage tissue form lesion . For patient LCH , standard-of-care vinblastine/prednisone use front-line therapy cytarabine therapy use therapy patient develop recurrence . No alternate treatment strategy develop frontline therapy LCH . The purpose research study compare previously use vinblastine/prednisone single therapy cytarabine LCH . We evaluate utility imaging study call positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan accurately assess area LCH involvement otherwise see image study well response therapy . We also want identify genetic biomarkers ( special proteins patient 's blood patient 's cancer ) relate response patient LCH study treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinblastine/Prednisone Versus Single Therapy With Cytarabine Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis ( LCH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To eligible participate study , patient physician must determine LCH treatable surgical intervention observation alone . If patient chooses participate study , assign randomly ( like flip coin ) one two LCH chemotherapy treatment group . A computer randomly determine begin receive vinblastine/prednisone treatment cytarabine treatment . Patient equal chance ( 50 % ) receive vinblastine/prednisone receive cytarabine . Neither patient doctor able choose group assignment , patient study doctor know treatment receiving . The patient need follow test , exam , procedure . Most part regular cancer care may do even patient want join study . Some may need repeat do recently . The patient 's doctor tell one need repeat . - History Physical - Blood test - Urine test - Biopsy confirm diagnosis - Bone Marrow biopsy/aspirate ( patient less 2 year old patient clinical concern bone marrow disease ) * - Lumbar puncture spinal fluid test ( patient disease pituitary gland brain ) - The bone marrow sample procedure follow : The skin hipbone make numb . This area sterilize small incision make . A bone marrow needle insert hipbone bone marrow withdrawn . Patient sign separate consent explain procedure detail . We also x-ray scan inside body . These scan may include chest bone x-ray , ultrasound , computerize tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and/or positron emission tomography ( PET ) . The specific test depend age , sit LCH clinical factor . An ultrasound sound wave machine use computer make picture tissue body . A CT x-ray machine use computer make picture organ body . An MRI scan us magnetic machine make picture inside body . A PET scan x-ray technique use sugar solution drink see activity inside body . The PET CT scan look LCH body . If test show patient participate study choose participate , treatment begin base randomization either cytarabine ( `` experimental '' ) arm vinblastine/prednisone ( `` standard '' ) arm describe . Patient history physical blood test cycle . The cancer drug give patient intravenously ( IV ) . An IV tube place inside vein give medicine patient . If anytime study cancer get bad , patient take study treatment . 1 . Cytarabine ( `` experimental '' ) arm Initial therapy I ( Weeks 1-6 ) • Cytarabine five consecutive day . This five-day cycle repeat every 21 day total four cycle . Patient scan see LCH respond treatment week 6 . If patient LCH bone marrow ( BM ) begin study , another BM biopsy . If cancer stable respond therapy Week 6 , patient take study treatment . If disease partly go unchanged patient receive additional therapy Initial therapy II . Initial therapy II ( Weeks 7-12 ) • Cytarabine five consecutive day . This five-day cycle repeat every 21 day total four cycle . Patient scan see LCH respond treatment week 12 ( unless active disease week 6 ) . If patient LCH bone marrow ( BM ) begin study , another BM biopsy . If cancer stable respond therapy Week 12 , patient take study treatment . If patient evidence active disease time proceed Continuation therapy . Continuation therapy ( Weeks 13-52 ) • Cytarabine five consecutive day . This five-day cycle repeat every 28 day 10 additional cycle complete one year therapy Patient scan see LCH respond treatment Week 24 end therapy . If patient LCH bone marrow ( BM ) begin study , another BM biopsy . 2 . Vinblastine/prednisone ( `` standard '' ) arm Initial therapy I ( Weeks 1-6 ) - Prednisone give mouth two time day daily day 1-28 AND - Vinblastine give IV ( vein ) one day week 6 week Patient scan see LCH respond treatment week 6 . If patient LCH bone marrow ( BM ) begin study , another BM biopsy . If disease completely go Week 6 , patient proceed Continuation therapy . If disease partly go unchanged patient receive additional therapy Initial therapy II . Patient scan see LCH respond treatment Week 12 LCH bone marrow ( BM ) begin study , another BM biopsy . Initial therapy II ( Weeks 7-12 , give patient evidence active disease Week 6 ) - Prednisone mouth first three day week week 7-12 AND - Vinblastine IV weekly week 7-12 If disease go well additional therapy Continuation therapy begin . Continuation therapy - 6-Mercaptopurine mouth daily AND - Prednisone mouth twice daily day day 1-5 every 3 week AND - Vinblastine IV every 3 week Patient scan see LCH respond treatment Week 24 end therapy . If patient LCH bone marrow ( BM ) begin study , another BM biopsy . STUDY FOLLOW-UP Patient study 5 year completion therapy . The doctor exam patient 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month , 18 24 month , yearly 5 year patient take treatment . At visit patient may routine blood test , scan , biology test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient must biopsyconfirmed diagnosis Langerhans cell histiocytosis . 1 . Patient may receive prior systemic chemotherapy LCH malignant disorder . Systemic steroids equivalent prednisone 1 mg/kg/day give 7 day 30 day period prior study enrollment . However , patient receive surgical radiation therapy , intralesional injection steroid , topical steroid may enrol . 2 . Patient may disease limited single skin bone site , follow exception : Central Nervous System ( CNS ) risk lesions/special site disease : patient single bone site CNSrisk ( sphenoid , mastoid , orbital , zygomatic , ethmoid , maxillary , temporal bone , cranial fossa , pituitary gland neurodegenerative disease ) `` special site '' ( odontoid peg , vertebral lesion intraspinal soft tissue extension ) require systemic therapy standard care thus eligible study . Functionally critical lesion : A single lesion describe may cause `` functionally critical anatomic abnormality '' wherein attempt local therapy ( surgical curettage radiation ) would cause unacceptable morbidity . These patient may enrol approval PI documentation rationale justify systemic therapy . 3 . Patient may severe renal disease ( creatinine great 3 time normal age OR creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/m2/1.73m^2 ) . 4 . Patient may severe hepatic disease ( direct bilirubin great 3 mg/dl OR aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) great 500 IU/L ) , unless hepatic injury due LCH . 5 . Patient may Karnofsky performance score &lt; 50 % Lansky performance score &lt; 50 % . 6 . Female patient may pregnant breastfeeding . 7 . Patients reproductive potential must use acceptable form birth control abstain sexual activity . 8 . Patients HIV unable unwilling stop antiretroviral therapy duration therapy may enrol . 9 . Patients exclude laboratory abnormality performance score may enrol study approval PI designee .</criteria>
