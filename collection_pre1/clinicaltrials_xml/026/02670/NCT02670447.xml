	<detailed_description>Recently , radiological marker demonstrate good capacity discriminate first episode psychosis patient , show bad response treatment . Furthermore , automatic learning method recently successfully applied neurological data , never first episode psychosis patient . These powerful method base multivariate analysis allow prediction individual stage . The possibility identify precisely population non-answering patient would allow adaptation support first attention patient , consequently perform appropriate care . Researchers propose project evaluate predictive factor non response . It define lack symptomatic remission month 3 , patient present first episode psychosis . It perform objective marker take imagery technique . The link evolution marker clinical measure study .</detailed_description>
