	<detailed_description>This randomise , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group , multisite , study demonstrate whether low dose stavudine ( d4T ) non-inferior tenofovir ( term viral suppression toxicity ) tenofovir ( TDF ) 2 year HIV treatment . If , allow approximately two people require antiretrovirals treat price one , outcomes two year . This huge public health consequence Southern Africa , TDF zidovudine ( AZT ) consume majority antiretroviral budget . Decreasing total drug dose antiretroviral agent , maintain efficacy , represent untapped possibility decreasing cost toxicity , efficacy maintain . Stavudine ( d4T ) , NRTI , currently second commonly use antiretroviral worldwide develop country . Stavudine ideal candidate assessment low cost , widespread use , co-formulation , albeit dose significant side effect . While well tolerate short term , dose-dependent medium long-term side effect , namely lipoatrophy peripheral neuropathy , common . lipoatrophy insidious , largely irreversible , highly stigmatise , These toxicity lead withdrawal Stavudine recommend drug country afford alternative , even second subsequent regimen ; World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recommend country , wherever possible , move away use Stavudine . However , data suggest low dose Stavudine would well tolerate currently recommend dose effective suppress viral load currently prefer first-line drug . Consented patient randomise one two treatment arm use interactive voice response system ( IVRS ) . The study monitor maintain current personal knowledge study observation , review study record source documentation , discussion conduct study principal investigator sub investigator staff . Data capture onto electronic data capture system manage completeness , consistency accuracy . All study operation patient recruitment , data management , safety reporting guide Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP ) document . A total 1068 male female antiretroviral-naive patient infect HIV-1 randomise 1:1 ratio ( approximately 534 patient per treatment group ) Treatment Group 1 ( d4T/3TC+EFV ) Treatment Group 2 ( TDF/3TC+EFV ) . Approximately 15 % patient expect evaluable PP set , therefore result 907 patient PP set . This provide 90 % power show non-inferiority 2 treatment group proportion patient achieve primary efficacy endpoint ( undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA level [ &lt; 50 copies/mL ] Week 48 ) PP set ( 94 % power all-randomised set ) , use non-inferiority margin 10 % 1-sided 2.5 significance level . The proportion patient achieve primary efficacy endpoint assume 70 % treatment group . The sample size calculation adjust allow stop 2 interim analysis .</detailed_description>

Patient follow clinical chemistry haematological laboratory result : Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL ( 133 μmol/L ) calculate creatinine clearance level ≥60 mL/min accord CockcroftGault formula Serum alanine aminotransferase &lt; 5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum aspartate aminotransferase &lt; 5 × ULN Serum lipase ≤1.5 × ULN Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL ( 25 μmol/L ) unless felt clinician due Gilbert syndrome Haemoglobin ≥7.0 g/dLAbsolute neutrophil count ≥500/mm3 Platelet count ≥50 000/mm3 . Female patient childbearing potential , include less 2 year postmenopausal , must agree , comply use highly effective method birth control ( eg , barrier contraceptive [ condom diaphragm spermicidal gel ] , hormonal contraceptive [ implant , injectable , combination oral contraceptive , transdermal patch , contraceptive ring ] , intrauterine device , sexual abstinence ) participate study . In addition , woman childbearing potential must agree continue use birth control throughout study last study visit Women Not Childbearing Potential woman postmenopausal permanently sterilise ( e.g . tubal occlusion , hysterectomy , bilateral salpingectomy ) . Women Childbearing Potential ( WOCBP ) Any female experience menarche meet criterion `` Women Not Childbearing Potential '' . Patient ability comprehend full nature purpose study , opinion investigator , include possible risk side effect , cooperate investigator , understand verbal write instruction , comply requirement entire study Patient inform full nature purpose study , include possible risk side effect , give ample time opportunity read understand information , sign date write informed consent inclusion study Patients previously receive treatment form antiretroviral therapy , include prevent mothertochild transmission regimens Patients take discontinue follow prohibit concomitant medication least 1 week prior baseline visit duration study period : Any agent significant nephrotoxic potential Probenecid Systemic chemotherapy agent Drugs significant interaction EFV rifampicin Administration medication discontinue least 1 week prior baseline visit duration study period . Patients clinically unstable , investigator 's opinion , stabilize prior inclusion study baseline concomitant medication stable least 1 month ( 30 day ) prior enrolment . In addition , investigator anticipate change dose level medication duration study . Patients , investigator 's opinion , require HIVrelated prophylaxis ( cotrimoxazole ) and/or HIVrelated treatment ( e.g . treatment oral thrush , tuberculosis , etc ) , investigator 's opinion clinically stable may treatment initiate discontinued screening period . The 30day wait period apply latter . Patients current history drug alcohol abuse , opinion investigator , may impediment patient adherence protocol Patients medical history evidence gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome , chronic nausea , vomit may prevent patient receive oral medication Patients participate study investigational drug within 60 day screen currently receive treatment investigational drug device Patients hepatitis B surface antigen positive Patients symptomatic peripheral neuropathy Female patient currently pregnant breastfeed Female patient desire pregnancy next 2 year Patients strong likelihood relocate far enough make access study site difficult</criteria>
