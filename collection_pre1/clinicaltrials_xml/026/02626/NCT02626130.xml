	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare safety effectiveness tremelimumab alone combination cryoablation patient metastatic kidney cancer surgery . Researchers also want learn combination may affect immune system . Cryoablation procedure use hollow , thin tube call cryoprobe freeze destroy cancer tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Presurgical Tremelimumab With Without Cryoablation Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group ( call `` arm '' ) . Both study staff know group . You equal chance assign either group . - If Arm A , receive tremelimumab surgery biopsy . - If Arm B , cryoablation receive tremelimumab surgery biopsy . All participant receive tremelimumab vein 60 minute one time every 4 week first 6 dos one time every 12 week . Cryoablation : If Arm B , cryoablation 2-6 day first dose study drug . To perform cryoablation , affect area first numb anesthetic . Your study doctor insert cryoprobe needle use ultrasound device help guide cryoprobe reach cancerous area . When place , cryoprobe use freeze cancerous area . The doctor careful try avoid damage surround normal tissue . The cryoablation procedure last 20 minute . The cryoprobe remove doctor think cancerous area treat much possible . There small wound , like puncture wound large needle . Most likely , need stitch close wound . Study Visits : Before dose tremelimumab , within 2 week surgery biopsy , within 4 week surgery every 4 week 3 month : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test , measure protein level , test liver , kidney , hormone function , test biomarkers , test immune system . Every 2 week first 2 month take tremelimumab , blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test , measure protein level , test liver kidney function . Within 2 week surgery , within 4 week surgery biopsy , study doctor think need , image scan screen check status disease . Before dose tremelimumab begin three ( 3 ) month surgery biopsy every 12 week : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test , measure protein level , test liver , kidney hormone function , test immune system . - If study doctor think need , image scan screen check status disease . Surgery Biopsy : About 5 week second dose tremelimumab , surgery kidney cancer . You ask sign separate consent form describe surgery risk . You may instead biopsy ask sign separate consent form describe biopsy risk . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your active participation study end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : At 30 , 60 , 90 day last dose study drug , return clinic follow test procedure : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test , measure protein level , test liver , kidney hormone function , test biomarkers , test immune system . - If study doctor think need , image scan screen check status disease . Long-Term Follow-Up : A member study staff contact every 6 month ask health disease get bad . This contact phone call e-mail . Your medical record may also review time . If contact phone , call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Tremelimumab FDA approve commercially available . Tremelimumab currently use research purpose . If Arm B , cryoablation system use cryoablation procedure FDA-approved use cancer . The use system metastatic kidney cancer combine tremelimumab investigational . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
