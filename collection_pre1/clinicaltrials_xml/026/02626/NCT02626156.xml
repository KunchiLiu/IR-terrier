	<brief_summary>The goal study test MUSTCOOL , home-based self-monitoring self-management ulcer prevention intervention patient newly heal chronic venous leg diabetic foot ulcer . Almost 90 % ulcer recur within 3 month heal . During six-month randomized clinic trial , skin temperature monitor daily , maintenance dose cool gel pack placebo apply three time weekly affect skin , bolus dose cooling apply 5 consecutive day skin temperature becomes elevate . Outcomes incidence leg ulcer recurrence , pain , physical activity quality life measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal randomize control trial test patient direct self-monitoring self-management intervention aim prevent recurrence chronic venous leg diabetic foot ulcer use skin temperature cryotherapy ( cool ) . This MUSTCOOL study novel ulcer prevention strategy patient high risk develop chronic ulcer ; previous history . The aim compare cool treatment placebo determine outcomes ulcer recurrence , pain , physical activity quality life . Individuals newly heal chronic ulcer invite participate MUSTCOOL 's two component intervention : 1. self monitoring skin temperature target `` hot spot '' daily infrared thermometer ; 2. maintenance cool cool pack ( placebo pack ) place `` hot spot '' three time week 30 minute . If temperature `` hot spot '' becomes elevate 2°F baseline ( average 30 day daily temperature reading ) 2 day row , bolus regimen 5 consecutive daily , 30 minute application cool placebo pack implement . The safety side effect monitor , however , report adverse event report previous cryotherapy study . This study design chronic ulcer prevention intervention target remodel phase , final repair process heal chronic ulcer closure . The skin environment particularly vulnerable ulcer recurrence due persistent aberrant inflammatory state . The previous research conduct study team demonstrate cool skin reduces abnormal metabolic activity , protect ulcer recurrence . Recent advancement infrared technology allow u take image affect skin identify area high temperature vulnerable `` hot spot '' . These `` hot spot '' self monitor patient newly heal ulcer home infrared thermometer date time stamps reading . The study 's outcome physical activity evaluate accelerometer . It hypothesize improve skin environment reduce pain , patient likely physically active good quality life , measurable goal study . This prevention strategy evaluate six month 180 patient , 90 randomize receive cooling pack 90 placebo . The goal test non-pharmacological , non-invasive clinical intervention tailor self-management strategy prevent chronic ulcer recurrence . It also determine alleviation symptom pain , debilitate effect physical activity quality life .</detailed_description>
