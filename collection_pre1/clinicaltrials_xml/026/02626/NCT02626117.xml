	<detailed_description>Successful treatment recession defect obtain new attachment prevent repair long junctional epithelium continue present serious therapeutic challenge . The concept laser deepithelialization retard epithelial migration enable new attachment formation periodontal pocket . Based hypothesis , laser deepithelialization root coverage procedure enhance clinical outcome , split mouth randomize controlled clinical trial plan compare clinical outcome Coronally advance flap ( CAF ) + subepithelial connective tissue graft ( SCTG ) alone combination laser de-epithelialization treatment gingival recession . METHOD : In split-mouth study , 20 patient present least one pair bilaterally symmetrical Miller 's Class I Class II buccal gingival recession select . Control site receive coronally advanced flap connective tissue graft test site receive laser deepithelialization adjunct coronally advanced flap connective tissue graft . Gingival recession depth ( GRD ) , Gingival recession width ( GRW ) , Probing depth ( PD ) , Clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , Keratinized tissue width ( KTW ) , Plaque index ( PI ) , Gingival index ( GI ) , Gingival bleed index ( GBI ) measure baseline , 6 week , 3 month 6 month treatment . The root coverage outcome also assess photogrammetric analysis .</detailed_description>
