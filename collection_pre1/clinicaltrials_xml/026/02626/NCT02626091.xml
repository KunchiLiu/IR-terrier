	<detailed_description>Accurate intraoperative evaluation peri-anastomotic gastrointestinal tract perfusion essential reduce risk anastomotic complication leakage stricture . Anastomotic leakage dreadful complication colorectal resection . Intestinal microcirculation viability usually estimate color serosal surface , presence peristalsis , pulsation bleed marginal artery . This subjective base experience surgeon . Fluorescence videography integrate near-infrared endoscope able detect signal emit fluorescent dye , Indocyanine Green ( ICG ) , administer intravenous injection . Fluorescence intensity proportional amount fluorescent dye diffuse tissue consequently surrogate marker tissue perfusion . The hypothesis ICG-fluorescence guidance couple enhanced reality would allow precise rapid localization future anastomotic site term optimal perfusion laparoscopic colorectal resection . In patient undergo elective left-sided colonic resection laparoscopic approach , resection site anastomosis perfusion evaluate : - visual appreciation surgeon - fluorescence-based enhanced reality , injection ICG digital process . A series peri-operative sampling also carry . In case , resection perform accord surgeon 's appreciation .</detailed_description>
