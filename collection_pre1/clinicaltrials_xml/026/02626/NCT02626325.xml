	<brief_summary>High saturate fat acid diet associate elevate blood pressure associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality . For reason , change diet recommend manage blood pressure prevent cardiovascular complication . To achieve nutritional goal , high-carbohydrate diet high-monounsaturated fat diet advise replacement saturate fat diet . Previous meta-analysis Garg ( 1998 ) cite randomized article inconsistent blood pressure lower consumption high-monounsaturated-fat diet compare high-carbohydrate diet type 2 diabetes patient . Moreover , another meta-analysis Shah et al . ( 2007 ) show slightly high blood pressure diet rich carbohydrate diet rich cis-monounsaturated fat randomize nonrandomized article . For reason , new meta-analysis randomized clinical trial perform clarify effect high-carbohydrate high-monounsaturated fat diet blood pressure . Results meta-analysis help health professional take important decision patient diet minimize cardiovascular morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
