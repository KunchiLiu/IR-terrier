	<detailed_description>The incidence rate postoperative capsular opacification ( PCO ) child cataract surgery report high 100 % , timely Nd : YAG laser posterior capsulotomy effective treat visual axis opacification ( VAO ) cause PCO . Therefore , long-term follow-up , timely diagnosis treatment important improve patient 's outcome . The major central part lens easy observe dilated pupil . Especially , opacification lens and/or lens capsule distinctive showing `` white '' `` black '' background . The characteristic feature disease advance photographic technique mobile phone make possible patient and/or guardian monitor progress cataract PCO mobile application `` self-help '' manner non-clinical setting . In way , patient and/or guardian could adjust time return clinical follow-up visit accordingly . Furthermore , standardize analyzed picture could send clinician remote diagnosis necessary . The investigator develop mobile phone application LenZOC . The investigator aim ass whether mobile phone application parent child cataract would improve adherence follow-up increase rate timely detection management treatable condition posterior capsular opacification ( PCO ) .</detailed_description>
