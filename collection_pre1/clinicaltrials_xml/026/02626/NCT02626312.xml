	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Radiation Therapy Patients With Liver Cancers Impaired Liver Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Radiation Administration : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level radiation base join study screen test result . The dose level radiation measure much radiation healthy part liver organs safely receive radiation therapy . Two ( 2 ) dose level radiation test . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive standard dose level . The second group receive either high low dose level group , depend side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose level find . Up 10 participant receive radiation high dose level find first part study . Radiation Therapy : You receive radiation therapy 5 day week total either 15 25 dos , base doctor think best interest . Each dose radiation receive take 5-10 minute , appointment dose radiation last 1 hour . The study doctor explain detail radiation give . You may receive chemotherapy part standard care study regular doctor think best interest . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week receive radiation : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ask complete symptom questionnaire person , internet , telephone . Length Study Participation : You receive radiation therapy 15 25 treatment . You longer able receive radiation treatment disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , study doctor think best interest , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visits : About 4-8 week complete radiation therapy , return clinic follow-up visit . You follow-up visit every 3 month first year ( +/- 1 month ) radiation therapy , every 4 month ( +/- 1 month ) second year radiation therapy . At visit follow test procedure : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You MRI , CT scan , and/or positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT check status disease . - Each week , fill symptom questionnaire follow-up period person , internet , telephone . This questionnaire take 10 minute . This investigational study . Radiation therapy deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method . Combining advanced radiation therapy technique functional imaging patient liver cancer decrease liver function consider investigational . Up 88 participant enrol study .
