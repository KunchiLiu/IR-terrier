	<brief_summary>By 2015 half people live HIV infection U.S. estimate age 50 , cohort patient well-controlled plasma viremia age rapid pace non-HIV peer . Long-term chronic inflammation play critical role premature age HIV-infected adult . Markers associate chronic inflammation , include IL-6 , CRP , sCD14 d-dimer , show present high level HIV-infected adult , also correlate wide variety morbidity mortality . The goal project determine impact two different intervention -- Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) Health Enhancement Program ( HEP ) -- reduce biological marker associate chronic inflammation HIV-infected adult undetectable HIV viral load . In order achieve goal , pilot RCT 120 subject 50 year old anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) conduct follow specific aim : 1 ) ass effect MBSR and/or HEP biomarkers chronic inflammation ( IL-6 , CRP , sCD14 , d-dimer ) , , 2 ) explore whether change psychological well-being ( anxiety , depression , fatigue , cognitive functioning ) mediate impact chronic inflammation . Subjects randomized participation group MBSR course HEP group consist 8 weekly session follow 6 monthly booster session . Three time point measure : baseline , 8 week ( immediately completion weekly intervention ) , 6-months post-completion weekly intervention . Mixed linear structural equation model use test study hypothesis . The propose study innovative first explore impact complementary mind-body intervention chronic inflammation HIV-infected adult . Given consequence early age cohort burden health care system well medical , social psychological burden living HIV , study potential major public health impact .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Mindfulness Training Chronic Inflammation HIV-Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study first examine form alternative complementary holistic therapy old long-term HIV-infected person well-controlled plasma viremia . It also first mind-body study HIV-infected adult conduct use rigorous randomize control trial ( RCT ) design . From translational medicine perspective , study innovative examines comprehensive set biological marker specifically associate chronic inflammation . No previous mind-body study specifically target set biological marker proven elevate adult HIV , also describe predictor morbidity overall mortality . This would first study explore whether improvement marker psychosocial stress mediate impact propose intervention chronic inflammation . This study innovative effort move HIV care beyond current focus virologic control , optimization comorbid condition , encouragement healthy lifestyle include active intervention address state chronic inflammation immune dysfunction underlie early accelerate age process . Most bio-behavioral research HIV date understandably focus patient poor adherence HIV medication treatment . This study novel focus highly adherent patient significant change profile biological marker associate chronic inflammation document cohort . The complementary medicine approach study potential integrated exist healthcare paradigm HIV-positive person . Specific Aims : Aim 1 : To assess effect MBSR HEP biomarkers chronic inflammation ( IL-6 , CRP , sCD14 , d-dimer ) , HIV-infected adult well-controlled plasma viremia . Aim 2 : To explore whether change marker psychosocial well-being ( anxiety , depression , fatigue , cognitive functioning ) mediate impact mind-body intervention chronic inflammation . General Study Design : The propose study prospective , randomize , clinical trial attention control direction dual PIs , behavioral scientist virologist . The study team also make investigator infectious disease , mind-body medicine , geriatrics , biostatistics . Subjects randomized participation 8-week group MBSR course Health Enhancement Program ( HEP ) . The study population consist 120 individual , 50 year old old , long-term ( 5 year ART longer ) HIV-infected adult well-controlled plasma viremia baseline IL-6 level 1.17 pg/mL great . Randomization stratify achieve balance distribution group base gender study site . One cohort group participate 8-week MBSR course follow six , once-per-month booster session , separate cohort group participate HEP , additional monthly educational meeting six month . Both group evaluate use two set measure : biological marker associate chronic inflammation ( IL-6 , CRP , sCD14 , d-dimer ) measure psychosocial stress ( anxiety , depression , fatigue , mindfulness ) . Subjects assess three time point : baseline , 8 week ( immediately completion weekly intervention ) , 6-months post weekly course ( immediately completion booster session ) . The investigator use mixed linear structural equation model test study hypothesis .</detailed_description>
