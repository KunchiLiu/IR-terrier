	<brief_title>The Effect Postrhinoplasty Taping Postoperative Edema Nasal Draping</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient inform individually procedure write informed consent obtain study . Undergoing primary open approach reduction rhinoplasty receive osteotomy lateral guard osteotomes inclusion criterion study . Fifty-seven consecutive primary open approach rhinoplasty patient refer tertiary reference center enrol study . Patients appoint either control , 2-week PRT 4-week PRT group randomized-consecutive fashion . External thermoplastic splint remove end first postoperative week . Patients control group subject nasal tap cast removal . All patient 2-week ( first third week ) 4-week ( first fifth week ) PRT group receive tap allocated time addition one week external nasal splint . These two group provide 1/2-inch wide tan-colored hypoallergenic 3M™ Micropore™ Surgical Tapes ( 3M , St Paul , Minnesota ) . Each volunteer individually show give instruction regard PRT . Nasal swell patient evaluate individually 7.5 mHz linear ultrasound ( US ) probe : small amount ultrasonic gel use scan skin noncontact mode prevent distortion nasal anatomy transducer pressure . The examiner access result previously obtain measurement order prevent measurement contaminate . Measurements carry four different point : nasion , rhinion , supratip tip four measurement , mean nasal skin thickness ( MNST ) calculate . Subjects group sort , base baseline MNST measurement , consecutively low high ; half patient higher MNST measurement categorize 'thick skin ' half categorize 'thin skin ' . The electronic caliper machine measure perpendicular distance outer epidermal surface underlying cartilage 2-dimensional B-mode image ( Capasee II Ultrasound , Toshiba Medical Systems , Tustin , California ) . US measurement carry five time individual subject : preoperatively ; end first , third fifth postoperative week ; sixth postoperative month . Measurements carry mainly morning avoid effect diurnal variation dermal edema . Surgical Technique All patient operate open approach rhinoplasty general anesthesia . All patient underwent rhinoplasty due cosmetic functional purpose . All case distribute evenly surgeon ( BO , YSY , BV , ST ) . Supraperichondrial subperiosteal dissection plane prefer plane dissection case . Surgical operation mainly reduction rhinoplasty comprise dorsal reduction bilateral lateral osteotomy . All lateral osteotomy carry intranasally guard curve lateral osteotomes . Incision-to-closure operative duration record patient . All subject routinely administer 0.1mg/kg dexamethasone operation . All case apply internal splint , tap 3M micropores cast external thermoplastic splint end operation . Postoperative suggestion , order medication identical group . Patients discharge hospital first postoperative day . All subject call back end first postoperative week removal external nasal pack . Statistical Analysis Statistical data analyse use SPSS 20.0 ( SPSS , Chicago , IL ) . All value calculate state descriptive statistic mean±Standard deviation unless otherwise state . ANOVA use comparison mean . Repeated ANOVA use patient repeat factor ultrasonographic measurement ( preoperative , first postoperative week , third postoperative week , fifth postoperative week sixth postoperative month ) . Significant result repeat ANOVA test analyse via pairwise comparison Bonferroni correction . Correlation analysis carry Pearson correlation analysis . Values p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
