	<brief_summary>Protein requirement active individual suggest great current recommend dietary allowance ( RDA ) . Nutritional requirement dietary amino acid adult traditionally determine utilizing nitrogen balance technique , prone underestimating protein requirement . As result , need re-evaluate recommendation order characterize dietary amino acid need may modulate physical activity . Recent study use minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation ( IAAO ) technique suggest protein requirement young men least 50 % high RDA base nitrogen balance data . The purpose study measure protein requirement active , young adult female use IAAO technique presence variable intensity exercise stimulus .</brief_summary>
