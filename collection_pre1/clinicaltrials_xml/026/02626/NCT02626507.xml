	<brief_title>Phase I Study Combination Gedatolisib With Palbociclib Faslodex Patients With ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palbociclib ( Ibrance® ) orally active highly selective reversible inhibitor cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) 4 CDK 6 . Faslodex® ( Fulvestrant ) potent anti-estrogen drug bind degrade estrogen receptor ( ERs ) . Interim result Phase 3 trial ( Study PALOMA-3 ) show combination palbociclib Faslodex increase progressive-free survival ( PFS ) 3.8 9.2 month patient metastatic estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative ( HER2- ) breast cancer progress anti-endocrine therapy ( Turner et al . 2015 ) . The palbociclib/Faslodex combination find well tolerate . Additionally , grow data indicate combination safely effectively administer front anti-endocrine therapy-naive patient neoadjuvant set . Gedatolisib ( code name PF-05212384 , formerly know PKI-587 ) intravenous ( IV ) adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) competitive , highly selective potent inhibitor pan-class I isoform phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) ( Fry et al . 2004 ) . Preclinical first-in-human study show manageable safety profile predictable toxicity class drug . Activation PI3-K/Akt/mTOR/p-S6 pathway associate endocrine resistance ER+ breast cancer . There ample evidence inhibition pathway , combination anti-hormonal therapy , increase PFS ( Baselga et al . 2012 ) . There also clinical evidence combination therapy target three pathway feasible , safe effective ( Sweeney et al . 2014 ) . The advantage Gedatolisib potential inhibit signal different PI3-K isoforms . Also important fact week administration may effective , less toxic , chronic oral dosing . If hyperglycemia surrogate effective PI3-K/Akt/mTOR/p-S6 inhibition , weekly dosing Gedatolisib would appear accomplish equivalent degree hyperglycemia chronically oral dose less toxicity . Preoperative neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy , reserve patient locally advance breast cancer goal render large breast cancer operable , become increasingly common due improvement disease-free survival overall survival . Historically , endpoint pathological Complete Response ( pCR ) neoadjuvant therapy ER+/HER2- breast cancer limit value . However , new target agent , high response rate , potential use pCR assessment strong clinical endpoint drug development . Given systemic response rate previously treat Stage 4 breast cancer patient , expectation similar high rate pathological improvement lead great use target agent neoadjuvant set . In addition potential well pathological improvement , advantage clinical study involve neoadjuvant therapy provide response information patient treatment-naïve . This type clinical trial also use assess cellular molecular change serial biopsy neoadjuvant therapy , aid development companion tissue and/or image biomarkers , development preclinical model . Accordingly , investigation ass safety efficacy combination Gedatolisib , palbociclib faslodex neoadjuvant set previously untreated patient ER+/HER2- breast cancer . Being first clinical trial use combination neoadjuvant setting , one main objective current trial determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) Gedatolisib use combination palbociclib faslodex . Subsequent Phase II clinical trial conduct assess safety efficacy Gedatolisib/palbociclib/faslodex combination , dose Gedatolisib MTD determine current trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A . Stage IIV , primary cancer place , noninflammatory invasive breast cancer confirm core needle incisional biopsy ( excisional biopsy allow ) : disease ER+ ( define ER expression &gt; 10 % invasive cancer cell accord immunohistochemical [ IHC ] stain ) HER2 ( define IHC stain 0 1+ fluorescence situ hybridization [ FISH ] ratio HER2 gene copy/chromosome 17 &lt; 2.0 . ) disease previously untreated breast cancer , operable intend undergo surgery disease ( e.g. , mastectomy lumpectomy ) completion neoadjuvant therapy disease must measurable , define clinically radiographically measureable target lesion breast ≥1 cm diameter disease axillary disease ( i.e. , identifiable tumor breast ≥1 cm physical exam radiographic study ) disease multicentric bilateral disease , provide target lesion meet eligibility criterion breast cancer patient lobular luminal histology include . However , patient lobular histology quarter total number patient trial , investigational drug likely great activity patient luminal histology . ( Note 1 : In patient Stage III disease , image study perform rule overt metastatic disease . In patient clinically positive axilla , histologic confirmation biopsy fineneedle aspiration perform . Patients clinically negative axilla undergo pretreatment sentinel lymph node sample . ) ( Note 2 : In patient Stage IV disease , disease must low burden . Low burden define study one metastatic site liver lung , three metastatic site bone , regardless number lymph node per late radiographic scan . If patient find metastatic disease scan ( ) perform patient completes study neoadjuvant therapy , surgery perform patient exclude study . ) B . Females ≥18 year age . C. Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , woman premenopausal surgically sterile ) must use effective contraceptive method ( abstinence , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , double barrier device ) study , must negative serum urine pregnancy test within one week prior treatment initiation .
