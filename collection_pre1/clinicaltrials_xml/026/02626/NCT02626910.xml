	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The project propose fill gap understand disparity healthcare primary care provider ( PCP ) quality perspectives adult Medicare beneficiary disability compare without disability . Studies document racial/ethnic , economic , education-related disparity , little know healthcare disparity relate disability . OBJECTIVE : The investigator ' goal engage stakeholder peer partner development evidence-based Patient-Inspired Surveillance Tool document variation healthcare PCP quality outcome consequence associate variation among people disability ( PWD ) people without disability ( PWOD ) . The tool intend provide guidance program policy ameliorate disparity , improve function , enhance autonomy population people . METHODS : The investigator explore perception determinant healthcare PCP quality partnership stakeholder include PWD , PWOD , family PWD , healthcare provider effort well understand underlie determinant healthcare disparity might accelerate clinical deterioration . Applying population weight data multi-variable method patient information include Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey ( MCBS ) , investigator determine presence absence perceive problem across 5 healthcare PCP quality `` comparators '' ( present ) magnitude impact likelihood patient ' functional improvement , functional decline , institutionalization , death reference status change 1 , 2 , 3 year . A decade data MCBS ( 40,000 work age elderly patient ) apply ensure adequate statistical power comparison . Stakeholders help interpret implication finding partner clinician researcher build Tool . PATIENT OUTCOMES : For aim 2 , outcome healthcare PCP quality across 5 `` quality comparators '' include patient ' perception care coordination quality , access barrier , technical skill PCP , interpersonal skill PCP , quality information provide PCP . Comparisons cross sectional contrasting proportion people stage disability reference PWOD perceive low verse high quality comparator . These 5 comparators become exposure aim 3 4 . For aim 3 4 , outcome include `` change '' ( individual remain Activity Daily Living ( ADL ) /Instrumental Activity Daily Living ( IADL ) stage ) , `` functional improvement '' ( recovery low ADL/IADL stage ) , `` functional decline '' ( deterioration high stage ADL/IADL limitation ) , `` institutionalization '' ( long-term nursing home ) , `` death . '' Comparison longitudinal prediction 1 , 2 , 3 year contrast change accord comparator .</detailed_description>
