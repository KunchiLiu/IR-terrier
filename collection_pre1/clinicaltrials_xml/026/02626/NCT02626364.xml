	<brief_title>Study Crenolanib Recurrent/Refractory Glioblastoma With PDGFRA Gene Amplification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proof concept , single-arm study investigate crenolanib monotherapy patient recurrent/refractory glioblastoma PDGFRA gene amplification . Eligible patient include recurrent/refractory glioblastoma prior therapy include surgery , radiation , temozolomide . The trial design assess anti-tumor activity crenolanib recurrent/refractory glioblastoma PDGFRA gene amplification base estimation progression-free survival ( PFS ) 6 month . Symptom burden evaluate use M.D . Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor ( MDASI-BT ) . Crenolanib administer orally continuously 100 mg TID 28-day cycle basis . Patients allow receive crenolanib maximum 26 cycle clinical benefit observe .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients ( male female ) ≥ 18 year age . 2 . Histopathologically confirm glioblastoma gliosarcoma ( WHO Grade IV ) confirm local pathology tissue screen . 3 . Radiologic evidence first recurrence initial treatment ( include surgery , radiation , temozolomide ) tumor refractory initial treatment without subsequent treatment glioblastoma gliosarcoma ( WHO Grade IV ) . Transformation low grade glioma previously treat radiation and/or temozolomide glioblastoma consider first recurrence purpose trial 4 . Tumor tissue available original diagnosis and/or recurrence ; minimum 1 FFPE archival tumor tissue block ( prefer ) minimum 20 FFPE unstained slide initial and/or recent preregistration biopsy resection . It recommend least 1 cm^2 tissue compose primarily ( define great 85 % ) tumor present . 5 . Confirmed PDGFRA amplification tumor tissue time diagnosis time recurrence . Central confirmation PDGFRA amplification perform FISH CLIA certify lab ( ProPath ) . Signal quantitation use generate PDGFRA/centromere 4 ratio . PDGFRA Centromere 4 ratio interpret follow : 1.8 2.2 , borderline amplification ; 2.2 5.0 , lowlevel amplification ; great 5.0 clustered signal numerous count would consider highly amplify . Tumor sample PDGFRA Centromere 4 ratio 2.2 high consider amplify therefore eligible trial . For patient local CLIA test demonstrate PDGFRA amplification Next Generation Sequencing ( Foundation Medicine , CMS400 ) , central testing require . 6 . Patients must adequate organ function baseline define : • Adequate liver function ( within 7 day crenolanib commencement ) , determine : Serum ALT , AST ≤ 2 × ULN Normal serum total bilirubin ( low upper limit local Laboratory ) Adequate renal function assess : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN 7 . KPS ≥ 60 8 . Recovered ( return ≤ grade 1 per CTCAE v4.03 ) prior treatmentrelated toxicity . 9 . A minimum 3 week must elapse last intake prior standard chemotherapy treatment . 10 . A minimum 6 week must elapse last dose nitrosoureas . 11 . A minimum 5 halflives last dose investigational agent must elapse prior C1D1 . 12 . More 12 week completion chemoradiation , unless RANO criterion early progression within 12 week chemoradiation meet ( See 18.1 ) 13 . Nonpregnant nonnursing woman childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 3 day crenolanib commencement ( `` Women childbearing potential '' define sexually active mature woman undergone hysterectomy menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . 14 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( simultaneous use 2 method birth control ) prior study entry , duration study participation 90 day follow completion therapy . 15 . Patient able willing provide inform consent . 16 . Ability understand willingness followup visit . 1 . Preexisting liver disease ( i.e. , cirrhosis , chronic hepatitis B C , nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , sclerosing cholangitis , etc . ) 2 . Known positive HIV 3 . Patients previously treat bevacizumab . 4 . NYHA Class IIIIV heart failure , myocardial infarction &lt; 6 month prior study entry , and/or serious arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy 5 . Patients receive concurrent anticancer treatment ( chemotherapy , investigational agent , immunotherapy , endocrine therapy , Optune®… ) 6 . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent disease affect cardiovascular system , liver , kidney , hematopoietic system else consider clinically important investigator could incompatible patient 's participation trial would likely interfere study procedures/results compromise compliance protocol . 7 . Pregnant breastfeed woman . 8 . Patients unable swallow pill . 9 . Patients allergic MRI contrast medium unable undergo MRI reason . 10 . Patients unable provide inform consent . 11 . Patients EIADs eligible , unless antiepileptic drug safely taper discontinue C1D1 .</criteria>
