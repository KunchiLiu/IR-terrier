	<brief_summary>Characterization driver mutation individual metastatic breast cancer patient critical many reason . Effective targeted therapy require identify genomic alteration tumoral tissue . The scarce efficacy many currently available target drug may due outbreak resistant clone different genotype already present initiation therapy . It well know intra-tumor heterogeneity genetic non-genetic factor consider origin tumor cell-clon composition . The acquisition multiple mutation ( driver passenger ) , altogether stage differentiation , accord cancer stem cell hypothesis , confers tumor cell clinically important property , resistance therapy seed ability . Moreover , current challenge establish whether metastatic cell arise aggressive dominant clone primary tumor metastasic tissue diverge substantial genetic change early evolution disease . Primary metastatic tumor may close clonal relationship evolve parallel acquire different genomic alteration . In real life , plausible model coexist different predominance accord tumoral tissue etiology . The study hypothesize breast cancer metastases primary tumor could harbor different genomic profile relate genomic region interest clinically relevant proportion metastatic breast cancer patient . Moreover , genomic aberration find metastatic breast cancer tissue could also detect CTCs circulate free DNA . If true , CTCs circulate free DNA would convenient , non-invasive , easily accessible source genomic material analysis mutation genomic aberration .</brief_summary>
