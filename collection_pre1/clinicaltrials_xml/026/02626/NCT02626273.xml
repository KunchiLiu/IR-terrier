	<brief_summary>The present protocol mainly involve understanding local interaction release product fat tissue hormone production bone tissue . These complex interaction adipocyte osteocyte activity could explain mechanism body response strategy weight loss include diet and/or physical activity program , well side effect encounter intervention . Adolescence period development characterize many metabolic somatic change may influence weight . Weights bear physical activity key factor allow body composition change ( i.e . fat bone tissue ) . The difficulty manage weight onset overweight obesity important growth spurt lead various hormonal dysregulation . The specific mechanisms evolution interaction two parameter ( fat bone tissue ) yet elucidate ; therefore aim analyze possible connection fat tissue quality skeleton order reduce related risk consequence weight loss obese individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The complex consequence childhood obesity represent major concern develop country , largely contribute metabolic complication costly repercussion burden disease . The burden exemplify high prevalence rate overweight obesity . The ADIBOX protocol design provide good understanding bone-adipocyte cross-talk adolescent obesity effect physical activity-induced weight loss cross-talk . Obesity effectively lead hormonal alteration favor accumulation fat mass loss bone mass . Advancing knowledge complex interaction adipocyte osteocyte activity may contribute mechanistic understand body 's response weight loss adolescence prevent cardiovascular risk . Indeed , adipose-bone tissue cross-talk recently link cardiovascular disease . Similarly adipose tissue , released-products bone tissue may act directly indirectly cardiovascular risk disease . The ADIBOX study , 40 week longitudinal study ( LS ) repeat measure four occasion ( baseline every fourteen week ) , allow u understand effect physical activity-induced weight loss cross-talk obese adolescent . Data analyze use Stata ( StataCorp , College Station , USA ) IBM Statistics SPSS version 22 ( IBM Corp , 2013 , Chicago , IL , USA ) significance accept two-sided alpha level p &lt; 0.05 . After test normal distribution ( Shapiro-Wilk test ) , data treat either parametric non-parametric analysis accord statistical assumption . Student test Mann-Whitney U test perform compare adipose tissue ( total , subcutaneous , visceral ) variation report bone mass variation lumbar spine group baseline . Pearson ( Spearman appropriate ) correlation coefficient use compare Fisher test ( command corcor Stata ) measure link exercise-inducing weight loss adipose tissue bone mass variation . Longitudinal data treat use mixed model analysis order treat fixed effect group , time group x time interaction take account within participant variability .</detailed_description>
