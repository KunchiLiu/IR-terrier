	<brief_title>Study Daratumumab Combination With Dexamethasone Resistant Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) second common haematological malignancy ( non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ) , represent 1 % cancer 2 % cancer death . Despite increased efficacy first-line agent , majority patient eventually relapse become resistant class available therapy . With 15,000 death MM expect 2014 United state America ( USA ) alone , remain need novel therapy treatment refractory MM improve outcome Daratumumab IgG1ĸ human mAb specifically recognize CD38 epitope . Daratumumab bind C-terminus CD38 . It produce recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cell line . Standard mammalian cell culture purification technology employ manufacture Daratumumab . Daratumumab target directly tumour cell selectively bind CD38 receptor , present high level malignant plasma cell multiple myeloma . While bind Daratumumab antibody CD38 vitro effect enzyme activity ( inhibit cyclase stimulate hydrolase activity ) , main effect Daratumumab antibody bind CD38+ myeloma cell line lysis cell death complement dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) , antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis ( ADCP ) , direct apoptosis follow crosslinking antibody molecule . These mechanism likely involved Daratumumab activity vivo , although primary mechanism action patient fully elucidate . Importantly , Daratumumab-induced ADCC CDC affect presence bone marrow stromal cell , indicate Daratumumab effectively kill MM tumour cell tumour-preserving bone marrow microenvironment . In vivo , Daratumumab highly active interrupt xenograft tumour growth low dosing . Daratumumab demonstrate activity myeloma single agent small phase I/II study combination Lenalidomide Dexamethasone enhance potency MM drug Lenalidomide offer interesting alternative chemotherapy myeloma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Must able understand voluntarily sign informed consent form 2 . Must able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement 3 . Age ≥18 year 4 . Life expectancy &gt; 6 month 5 . Patients must relapse myeloma , previously treat Bortezomib , Lenalidomide , Pomalidomide treatment , resistant refractory Bortezomib Lenalidomide Pomalidomide treatment , define follow : 5.1 . Any number prior therapy 5.2 . Patients must Progressive Disease define IMWG one following ( Kyle , 2009 ) : Increase 25 % low response value one following : Serum Mcomponent ( absolute increase must ≥ 0.5 g/100 ml ) b and/or Urine Mcomponent ( absolute increase must ≥ 200 mg per 24 h ) and/or Only patient without measurable serum urine Mprotein level : difference involve uninvolved FLC level ( absolute increase must &gt; 10 mg/l ) . Bone marrow plasma cell percentage ( absolute % must ≥ 10 % ) Definite development new bone lesion soft tissue plasmacytoma definite increase size exist bone lesion soft tissue plasmacytoma Development hypercalcemia ( correct serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/100 ml ) attribute solely plasma cell proliferative disorder 5.3 . Patients must undergo prior treatment Bortezomib Lenalidomide Pomalidomide : They must receive least two cycle therapy Either diagnosis relapse Either separate regimen within regimen The line treatment Bortezomib and/or Lenalidomide and/or Pomalidomide need last line prior therapy 6 . Patients must clearly detectable quantifiable monoclonal Mcomponent value : IgG ( serum Mcomponent &gt; 10g/l ) IgA ( serum Mcomponent &gt; 5g/l ) IgD ( serum Mcomponent &gt; 0.5g/l ) Light chain ( serum Mcomponent &gt; 1g/l Bence Jones &gt; 200mg/24H ) In patient without measurable serum urine Mprotein level absolute serum FreeLight chain ( sFLC ) ≥100 mg/l abnormal sFLC K/λ ratio ( &lt; 0.26 &gt; 1.65 ) find ( Dispenzieri , 2008 ) . 7 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status score 0 , 1 , 2 8 . Adequate bone marrow function within 5 day prior 1st drug intake ( cycle1 , day 1 , C1D1 ) , without transfusion growth factor support within 5 day prior 1st drug intake , define : Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1000/mm3 Platelets ≥ 50000/mm3 Haemoglobin ≥ 8.5g/dl 9 . Adequate organ function define : Serum creatinine clearance ( CockcroftGault formula ) ≥30 ml/min Serum SGOT SGPT &lt; 3.0 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL 10 . Wash period least 2 week previous antitumor therapy investigational treatment 5 halflives previous antibody . 11 . Women partner men childbearing potential must practice one follow method birth control : subcutaneous hormonal implant , levonorgestrel release intrauterine system , medroxyprogesterone acetate depot , tubal sterilization , ovulation inhibitory progesterone pill , sexual intercourse vasectomize male partner ( vasectomy must confirm 2 negative semen analysis ) . Or woman commit absolute continuous abstinence confirm physician monthly basis . Childbearing potential* . Contraception start therapy include dose interruption , 4 month discontinuation Daratumumab . Criteria woman childbearing potential : This protocol define female childbearing potential sexually mature woman : 1. undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy 2. naturally postmenopausal ( amenorrhea follow cancer therapy rule childbearing potential ) least 24 consecutive month ( ie , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) 12 . A woman childbearing potential must 2 negative serum urine pregnancy test Screening , first within 28 day prior dose second within 48 hour prior dose , remain highly effective method birth control . The two method reliable contraception must include one highly effective method one additional effective ( barrier ) method . FCBP must refer qualified provider contraceptive method need . The following example highly effective additional effective method contraception : Highly effective method : Intrauterine device ( IUD ) Hormonal ( birth control pill , injection , implant ) Tubal ligation Partner 's vasectomy Additional effective method : Male condom Diaphragm Cervical Cap 13 . Serum ( urine case serum possible timely manner ) pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential regularly study , . In addition , pregnancy test may do time study discretion investigator subject miss period unusual menstrual bleeding . 14 . A woman childbearing potential must remain highly effective method birth control . Contraception must begin 4 week initiate treatment Daratumumab , therapy , dose interruption continue 4 month follow discontinuation Daratumumab . Reliable contraception indicate even history infertility , unless due hysterectomy . 15 . A man vasectomy sexually active woman childbearing potential must agree use barrier method birth control eg , condom spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository , men must also donate sperm study , 4 month follow discontinuation Daratumumab . The exception restriction subject 's female partner surgically sterile , second method birth control require . 16 . Subjects affiliated appropriate social security system . 1 .
