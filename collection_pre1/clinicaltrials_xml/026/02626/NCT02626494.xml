	<detailed_description>Cocaine addiction devastate disorder potentially harmful psychological , physical social consequence . Despite clinical importance , currently approve pharmacological treatment available cocaine addiction . However , preclinical research recently identify potentially promising target pharmacotherapeutic approach mainly base advance understand neuroplastic alteration associate repeated cocaine administration animal . Preclinical animal model reveal chronic administration cocaine lead decrease basal level glutamate within nucleus accumbens key region neural reward circuitry ; turn , reinstatement drug seek result enhance glutamatergic transmission . However , little known similar change human , functional role addictive behavior , mainly due methodological restriction . The investigator thus aim examine change associate chronic cocaine use glutamate homeostasis human use newly develop proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) protocol . This method allow quantification brain metabolite glutamate specific region human brain even within small subcortical volume interest nucleus accumbens hitherto difficult ass . Interestingly , administration n-AC restored glutamate homeostasis rat reduce drug reinstatement behavior . Therefore , present study aim investigate pharmacological challenge n-AC influence glutamate homeostasis human whether possible modulation link cocaine craving . Power analyse identify sample size study , do focus 1H-MRS , critical procedure context within project . Assuming mean conservative effect size d=0.80 , Î±-error probability 5 % , conservative power estimation 80 % consider drop-out rate 30 % , investigator plan measure 30 cocaine dependent patient 30 healthy control . Imaging data low quality ( e.g . due movement artifact ) exclude . If imaging data exclude participant finish experiment , investigator additionally recruit participant order ass plan sample size . Throughout duration entire study , conductance pre-defined key process constantly monitor independent monitor specify visit interval ensure study conduct accordance approve protocol , good clinical practice , applicable regulatory requirement order protect right well-being study participant integrity data .</detailed_description>
