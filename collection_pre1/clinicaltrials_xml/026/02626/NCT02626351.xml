	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION TO QUALITY IMPROVEMENT Quality Improvement ( QI ) , define `` systematic continuous action lead measurable improvement health care service health status target patient group '' ( IOM 2014 ) root consumer industry far back 1920s . Data-driven structured process improvement origins consumer industry , particularly motor vehicle , Avedis Donabedian first describe model healthcare quality improvement 1960s reflect process change model utilised consumer industry : key element structure , process outcome . Don Berwick colleague found Institute Healthcare Improvement ( IHI ) 1990s , lead institution QI worldwide . The QI approach 'form ' structured us specific QI tool , whereas application 'function ' varied depend select process intervention local context . Given move towards rigorously improve quality health care worldwide , QI methodology increasingly gain popularity high-income setting also low- middle-income country ( LMIC ) include South Africa Department Health ( DoH ) commitment improve quality health care reduce disparity thereof . EVIDENCE BASE FOR QI Whereas QI increasingly use worldwide include resource-rich setting resource-limited setting , paucity scientific evidence assess causal impact QI health outcome , particularly gold standard randomize controlled trial . Studies resource-limited setting suggest beneficial effect QI measure healthcare outcome however none assess QI rigorously single intervention . GAPS IN THE PMTCT CASCADE AND INFANT NUTRITION Despite worldwide rollout antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) effort prevent mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) , still large gap coverage approximately 240,000 infant vertically infect HIV worldwide , 89 % WHO Africa region . South Africa high prevalence HIV , national average 30 % amongst antenatal care ( ANC ) client . In Africa Centre Demographic Surveillance Area ( DSA ) locate within Hlabisa sub-district uMkhanyakude district , HIV prevalence amongst female reproductive age ( 15-49 year ) range 20-45 % 2011.KwaZulu-Natal province high prevalence HIV amongst ANC client 37.4 % 2012 . Furthermore , although KwaZulu-Natal ( KZN ) high rate ART coverage amongst HIV-infected pregnant woman eligible ART , uMkhanyakude district KZN ART coverage 73 % period , far behind national target 90 % . Studies show inadequate virologic suppression amongst HIV-infected pregnant breastfeeding ( PBF ) mother , inadequate repeat HIV test HIV-negative mother PBF period . Surveillance PBF mother Kenya , Malawi South Africa demonstrate HIV seroconversion rate approximately 4 % , illustrate need repeat HIV test pregnancy breastfeed order minimize risk MTCT . Moreover rate virologic suppression amongst HIV-infected PBF woman vary 27 % ( Kenya ) 72 % Malawi study , underscore importance virologic monitoring reduce MTCT virologic suppression . A study Kenya demonstrate repeat HIV test rate approximately 23 % HIV negative mother . Given risk seroconversion PBF , World Health Organisation recommend repeat HIV screen PBF high prevalence setting . Although SA achieve commendable reduction MTCT 2.7 % 2011 6 week age line UNAIDS call virtual elimination MTCT 2015 , gap PMTCT coverage increase risk undetected maternal HIV seroconversion inadequate virologic suppression therefore PMTCT achievement date may reverse without adequate intervention . Furthermore , give fertility rate population , MTCT rate 2.7 % antenatal HIV prevalence 30 % number new infant infection per year South Africa concern high . Preliminary data Africa Centre suggest less 40 % HIV-negative pregnant woman undergo re-testing HIV pregnancy , whilst approximately 10-20 % lifelong ART ( initiate prior current pregnancy ) virologic failure . An important component agenda reduce maternal morbidity mortality prevent unwanted pregnancy well uptake family planning method . However limitation contraceptive uptake include lack knowledge lack access resource-limited setting . According UNFPA estimate , contraceptive prevalence South Africa approximately 65 % despite free access method . Although replacement feed HIV-exposed infant might mitigate risk MTCT , resource-limited setting unreliable access safe drinking water high risk childhood illness diarrhoea pneumonia associate high rate mortality . As 5 childhood mortality setting reduce significantly exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) , WHO recommend EBF HIV-infected HIV-uninfected mother , whilst importance ART virologic suppression emphasise . These recommendation endorse South African DoH however stigma associate EBF HIV-infected mother often become barrier uptake EBF general . South Africa low rate EBF world 2012 8 % . New South African DoH ART guideline implement January 2015 , notably change PMTCT guidance Option B+ ( lifelong ART pregnant woman regardless CD4 count ) . HIV screen every 3 month PBF also recommend due risk seroconversions give high prevalence HIV South Africa . Furthermore , viral load ( VL ) test PBF ART recommend , immediately already ART prior pregnancy every 6 month thereafter ( assume VL result &lt; 1000 copies/mL ) ; newly diagnose PBF woman receive VL test 3 month initiate ART 6 monthly thereafter ( assume VL result &lt; 1000 copies/mL ) . THE CONTEXT OF ANTENATAL AND POSTNATAL CARE SERVICES The Africa Centre Population Health locate Hlabisa sub-district uMkhanyakude district rural KwaZulu-Natal South Africa . The Africa Centre Demographic Surveillance Area ( DSA ) cover area 438 km2 home Africa Centre Household Demographic Surveillance System ( HDSS ) , cover approximately 90,000 people 11,000 household annually . The HDSS longitudinal cohort early 2000s collect individual household information mortality , fertility , migration , health status socio-economic data . This provide nuanced understand study population enable link datasets . There 7 primary healthcare clinic ( PHC ) facility nurse-led DSA , provide ANC , PNC medical service , one local district hospital ( Hlabisa hospital ) offer tertiary care service include routine emergency obstetric care . The number delivery occur Hlabisa sub-district estimate 3000 per annum . The local hospital also provide medical doctor support PHCs available . As part National Strategic Plan improve quality healthcare service , DoH roll District Clinical Specialist Teams ( DCST ) include family physician , paediatrician , anaesthetist , midwife obstetrician . However success staff recruitment DCST vary . Finally , local scoping study ( unpublished data ) healthcare staff demonstrate gap train , supervision retention staff consequent impact healthcare worker motivation performance . STUDY HYPOTHESIS AND JUSTIFICATION Given nature overstretch health service , gap PMTCT cascade infant nutrition illustrate , QI intervention consider appropriate optimise clinic process therefore healthcare outcome . It anticipate real time data-driven approach , process outcomes continuously monitor , thereby motivate long term sustainability change clinical practice improve provider patient satisfaction service . Furthermore , QI strategy South African DoH commit , part improve quality health service work several project Centre Rural Health ( CRH ) , University KwaZulu-Natal . The investigator believe first study causally assess impact QI specify health care outcome , utilize randomise control trial ( stepped-wedge ) study design .</detailed_description>
