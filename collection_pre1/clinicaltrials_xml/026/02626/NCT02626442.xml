	<detailed_description>A major public health problem age half stroke survivor significant cognitive problem , call vascular cognitive impairment , nondementia ( VCIND ) also 10fold increase risk go develop full dementia . Investigators University Maryland VA Maryland Exercise Robotics Center Excellence ( MERCE ) develop exercise program individual suffer disable stroke improve cardiovascular fitness level , walk function , balance , reverse impair glucose tolerance ( prediabetic state ) non-insulin dependent diabetes nearly 60 % stroke patient . Our recent randomize study provide first evidence aerobic exercise ( cardiovascular ) improve select aspect cognitive function typically decline aging , increase indirect measure blood flow brain . All finding provide hope exercise improve brain health reduce recurrent stroke include silent stroke ( 9/10 stroke silent ) , improve cognitive function . Yet , study knowledge show exercise training improve element brain health individual minor stroke , silent stroke , great risk stroke due presence cerebrovascular risk factor ( e.g. , hypertension , prediabetes , etc. ) . Research study pilot clinical demonstration project design : 1 ) provide new insight potential role exercise improve brain health age minor stroke risk stroke use advanced brain image techniques; 2 ) extend finding exercise brain health population cerebrovascular disease , include less severe neurological deficits; cerebrovascular risk factor , minor stroke , transient ischemic attack ( neurological deficit resolve , still high risk event ) , silent stroke , extremely common predictive develop cognitive decline dementia . Furthermore , investigator dedicate test exercise program reach community . Therefore , investigator propose use low intensity exercise class format investigator already implement safely effectively County Senior Centers Maryland last 4 year disabled stroke patient , toward train minimally disable nondisabled old individual silent minor cerebrovascular disease . The result study lay groundwork community partner broad dissemination provide exercise program design preserve improve brain health high risk vascular disease cognitive decline age . The hypothesis 6 month supervise exercise class improve brain function cognitive function among individual cerebrovascular risk factor , minor stroke , TIA , silent stroke indicate measure train 1 ) write computer - base cognitive function ( memory think ) mood test 2 ) MRI picture brain see blood flow increase damage due old stroke age reduced exercise training . Individuals cerebrovascular risk factor ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes ) , minor stroke ( nondisabling stroke term community home walking capability ) , TIA ( warn stroke ) , silent stroke ( see brain imaging , paralysis obvious stroke sign symptom ) enter 6 month duration exercise class . Initial medical neurological evaluation conduct credentialed Clinician assure individual eligible medically neurologically approve participation low intensity aerobic exercise class . All subject approval primary care provider , document awareness medical approval patient enter low moderate exercise intensity class . This medical clearance already Institutional Review Board approve use similar exercise class stroke neurologic disability Howard County Department Aging Senior Centers . Before start exercise , subject give series baseline test : 1 ) walk balance test characterize mobility performance capacity ( timed walk , Short Physical Performance Battery , Functional Reach , Berg Balance Test , modify dynamic gait index , 4 square stepping , 2 ) 12 hour battery write computer base cognitive function mood test questionnaire , 3 ) MRI last 1 hour include picture brain . All test repeat midpoint ( i.e. , 3 month ) end train program ( 6 month , MRIs perform baseline 6 month ) . The exercise class consist supervise walk well bar chair exercise address upper low extremity function . The class occur 3 time per week 6 month . Individuals instruct perform select parallel exercise home remain day week record activity homework logbook . This protocol design modular fashion collect outcomes baseline post MERCE exercise robotics intervention .</detailed_description>
