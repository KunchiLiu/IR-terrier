	<brief_title>Trial Repeated Analgesia With Kangaroo Care - 18 Month Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Infants Neonatal Intensive Care Unit receive average 7 painful procedure daily yet less half receive intervention manage pain . Importantly , adverse long-term effect associate untreated pain . Moreover , developmental trajectory infant bear preterm compromise prolonged period separation mother hospital stay also impact mother-infant relationship . Thus , crucial need minimize procedural pain associate consequence . Kangaroo Care ( KC ) effective strategy reduce procedural pain promote mother-infant interaction infant demonstrate multiple clinical trial systematic review . Not know impact consistent KC pain long term outcome . The primary aim study determine maternal KC provide painful procedure early life mitigate stress release improve neurobehavioural outcome infant , decrease subsequent pain response , enhance maternal-child interaction beyond period hospitalization . Research Design : Using randomize clinical trial follow design , mother-infant dyad take part current CIHR NSHRF-funded TRAKC trial ( randomize one three intervention routine clinically necessary painful procedure duration initial neonatal intensive care unit hospital stay ( KC/placebo ; sucrose alone , consider standard care ; KC/ sucrose ) compare neurobehavioural outcomes 18 month . Procedure : Eligible mother-infant dyad contact prior routine 2 , 6 , 12 18 month clinic visit visit , infant undergo immunization naturalistic observation record . Coders blind study score pain intensity maternal comforting behavior use validated measure . At 18 month visit , train medical assessor blind group assignment perform primary outcome measure , Bayley Scales Infant Development ( 3rd ed ) ( BSID-III ) . Outcomes : The investigator hypothesize infant current TRAKC trial assign either KC group ( alone combination sucrose ) compare infant sucrose alone group : Primary outcome : H1 . high score BSID-III 18 month correct postnatal age . Secondary outcome : H2 . high score socio-affective development ( Social-Emotional axis BSID-III Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment ( BITSEA ) ; H3 . low score Negative Affectivity , high score Surgency/Extraversion Effortful Control measure Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire ( ECBQ ) ; H4 . low pain score measure use Modified Behavioral Pain Scale ( MBPS ) 2 , 6 , 12 , 18 month ; . H5 . high maternal infant interaction score measure use Measure Adult Infant Soothing Distress Scale ( MAISD ) 2 , 6 , 12 18 month . Sample size : The sample size 159 mother-infant dyad 18 month . Benefits Research Project : New evidence long-term impact early KC provide early painful procedure important effective management procedural pain development vulnerable infant . By fully integrate mother family active participant , direct implication regard improvement outcomes at-risk newborn , immediate physiological stability later development , also family , health care system general .</detailed_description>
