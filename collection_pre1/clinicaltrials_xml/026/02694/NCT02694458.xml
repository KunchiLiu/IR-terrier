	<brief_summary>Vancomycin standard first-line treatment MRSA infection first-line empiric therapy . The relationship exposure vancomycin efficacy admit important intersubject variability , therapeutic exposure n't usually achieve . The primary aim randomize control trial evaluate new early dosage adjustment strategy vancomycin child , compare usual treatment strategy . Using bayesian approach , purpose achieve earlier therapeutic non-toxic exposure vancomycin . The primary hypothesis early dosage adjustment strategy use bayesian approach allow patient achieve vancomycin pharmacological target faster usual treatment strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction/ Clinical significance : Staphylococcus aureus common cause serious infection . Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) one common cause nosocomial antibiotic resistant bacterial infection world . According last data European Antimicrobial Resistance Network , 2014 , 17,4 % invasive staphylococcal infection due MRSA France , proportion 56 % region European Economic Area ( EEA ) . In United-States America , MRSA reach 50 % Staphylococcus isolate study . Vancomycin standard first-line treatment MRSA infection first-line empiric therapy . To optimize good clinical outcome invasive MRSA infection use pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics vancomycin , study support target area curve ( AUC ) serum concentration versus time 24 hour minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) ratio â‰¥ 400 , frequently correlate trough concentration 15 - 20 mg/L MIC 1 mg/L . Because consensus regard dosage use high intersubject variability , pharmacological target difficult reach child , may lead delayed infection control increase vancomycin toxicity-related side effect . Aims : The primary aim evaluate early dosage adjustment strategy vancomycin child , compare usual treatment strategy . Using bayesian approach , main purpose achieve earlier therapeutic non-toxic exposure vancomycin . The secondary aim compare usual treatment strategy 1 ) proportion subject vancomycin serum concentration within concentration target 24th hour treatment , 2 ) clinical ( term fever ) , biological ( term CRP ) bacteriological ( term blood culture ) efficacy early dosage adjustment strategy vancomycin . Hypothesis : This study hypothesize early dosage adjustment strategy vancomycin use bayesian approach superior usual treatment strategy achieve pharmacological target vancomycin 24th hour treatment child . Methodology : As part routine care , prospective open-label randomize control trial conduct major paediatric hospital Paris , France . Subjects divide two arm . Each arm contain 50 subject . For subject Modeling arm , drug concentration measure 3rd hour treatment dosage adjustment do 6th hour treatment use bayesian approach . Vancomycin serum concentration measure 24th hour treatment . Subjects control arm receive usual treatment strategy . Vancomycin serum concentration measure 24th hour treatment .</detailed_description>
