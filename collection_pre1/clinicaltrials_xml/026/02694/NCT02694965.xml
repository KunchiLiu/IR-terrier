	<detailed_description>Understanding genetic alteration factor contribute process would critical identification novel immunotherapeutic target may synergize T cell-targeted checkpoint inhibitor . Furthermore , work promise provide great insight tumor-mediated immune evasion mechanism primary immunotherapy resistance , potentially unveiling predictive marker clinical response expand arsenal immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy . Many patient exhibit response anti-PD-1 antibody develop prolonged course disease stability resemble equilibrium phase previously propose process cancer immunoediting . This state equipoise hypothesize involve genetic alteration promote immune evasion , case , lead development tumor escape . Based data , investigator propose melanoma develop period disease stability response anti-PD-1 immunotherapy exhibit genetic alteration suppress effectiveness anti-tumor immunity . Our previous study indicate tumor-derived factor play role paracrine signal pathway capable regulate nearby stromal cell population likely critical immune regulator tumor microenvironment . Therefore , investigator focus study differentially express gene encode soluble protein use available prediction algorithm . Those gene identify study differentially express melanoma tissue patient demonstrate clinical response immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy evaluate transgenic autochthonous melanoma model .</detailed_description>
