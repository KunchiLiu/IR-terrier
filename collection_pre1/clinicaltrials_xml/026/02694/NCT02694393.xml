	<detailed_description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa infects airways 80 % adult Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) . In patient , P. aeruginosa form extremely antibiotic resistant biofilm community accelerate progression obstructive lung disease . Current treatment airway infection focus monthly cycle inhale antibiotic . However 20 % adult infected multi drug resistant P. aeruginosa effective inhaled treatment . These isolates common patient age increase life expectancy CF population , MDR P. aeruginosa likely remain clinical problem . Another 10 % patient infect Gram-negative organism Burkholderia cepacia Achromobacter specie , inadequate suppressive treatment . Following lung transplant , MDR airway infection remain problem allograft colonize strain carry paranasal sinus . Sodium nitrite may present new antimicrobial approach treat respiratory infection Gram-negative organism , able prevent biotic biofilm formation . Within CF lung , P. aeruginosa grow biotic biofilm association airway epithelial cell mucous plaque . This environment acidic pH low oxygen tension many bacteria subsist denitrification ( condition traditional antibiotic less effective ) . Because biotic biofilms 500-fold resistant biofilms grow abiotic surface , support CF Research Development Program ( RDP ) Cores , show nitrite prevents biofilm formation surface primary CF airway epithelial cell . Moreover , nitrite dose-dependently potentiates effect colistin sulfate liquid culture , biotic biofilms airway epithelial cell . These data support hypothesis nebulized sodium nitrite inhibit growth Pseudomonas aeruginosa CF airway , identify potential therapeutic benefit nitrite alone cooperatively colistin novel therapy inhibit P. aeruginosa CF airways . Nebulized nitrite extensive animal toxicology , well tolerated subject pulmonary arterial hypertension study pulmonary vasodilator . To determine therapeutic potential sodium nitrite CF , propose two specific aim : Aim 1 : 1 . Determine safety nebulized sodium nitrite administer two dos patient CF chronic P. aeruginosa infection . Aim 2 : 2 . Explore effect inhale sodium nitrite measure lung function , exhale airway nitric oxide , bacterial burden measure quantitative sputum culture P. aeruginosa . To accomplish aim , propose Phase I/II open-label study sodium nitrite CF . Key inclusion criterion include individual age 18 cystic fibrosis document clinical feature CF , genotyping positive sweat test . Study participant must additionally 2 positive respiratory culture Pseudomonas aeruginosa within past 12 month . Exclusion criterion include advanced lung disease , inability discontinue inhale antibiotic eight week , hospitalization medication change within 4 week dose , baseline systemic hypotension ( SBP &lt; 90 mm hg ) , chronic kidney disease ( Cr &gt; 2.5 ) , severe anemia ( Hgb &lt; 9 gm/dL last six month ) . The primary outcome safety , define FEV1 measure initial dos day 0 7 , week 4 . Other safety data initial dos include pulse oximetry transcutaneous methemoglobin level . Secondary endpoint include quantitative sputum culture , exhale nitric oxide , sputum nitrite concentration , patient symptom assess CF specific respiratory questionnaire . Completion study guide development sodium nitrite single agent CF infection , inform future study examine effect sodium nitrite combination inhale colistin patient drug resistant bacterial pathogen increase problem . In addition , study provide important safety efficacy data may inform future development inhale sodium nitrite therapy young patient augment airway host defense prevent biofilm formation .</detailed_description>
