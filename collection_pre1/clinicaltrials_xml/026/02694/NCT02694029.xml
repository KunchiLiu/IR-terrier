	<detailed_description>Female patient treat radiation left-sided breast malignancy undergo alternate fraction ABC-assisted VisionRT-assisted DIBH . Residual motion breath-hold quantitatively assess use MV fluoroscopy treatment beam ( i.e. , additional radiation dose ) . The dosimetric impact residual motion organ risk ( heart lung ) assess apply rigid and/or deformable displacement plan CT image , compute 3D dose map compare original plan dose map .</detailed_description>
