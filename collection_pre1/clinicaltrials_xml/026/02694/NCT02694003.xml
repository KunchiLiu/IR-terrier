	<brief_summary>More 90 % child neurodevelopmental disorder ( NDD ) experience sleep problem , whereas less 25 % typically develop child experience sleep problem . Poor sleep significant consequence child 's physical psychosocial health , well caregiver ' well-being . The impact sleep problem daytime function even great child NDD . Although range factor may disturb sleep child NDD , frequent cause sleep disturbance behavioural insomnia . There evidence behavioural intervention effective improve sleep child NDD . However , test well-designed , large-scale randomize control trial ( RCTs ) . Moreover , number significant barrier access insomnia treatment child ; importantly , sleep intervention often provide specialist , limit access treatment service . Instead , behavioural insomnia often treated advice sleep hygiene supplement melatonin , , best , short-term solution . The investigator , interdisciplinary team researcher , develop evaluate effectiveness online sleep intervention widely accessible sustainable potential dramatically improve health child NDD family .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study develop evaluate web-based intervention insomnia among child neurodevelopmental disability ( NDD ) , include Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) , Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder ( FASD ) , Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) , Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . Using internet deliver intervention program insomnia child address access barrier provide evidence-based treatment large number child NDD . This study adapt Better Nights , Better Days ( BNBD ) e-intervention develop typically develop child age 1-10 year . The adaptation BNBD lead team expert field sleep child NDD , include ASD , FASD , CP , ADHD . The adaption focus behaviour pose challenge implementation evidence-based sleep intervention strategy ( e.g. , anxiety , parental stress , sensory sensitivity , language impairment , attention difficulty , etc . ) , rather disorder-specific symptom . The intervention develop child age 3-10 year , mild moderate NDD impairment . The effectiveness intervention improve child 's sleep daytime functioning , well secondary effect well-being caregiver , evaluate randomize control trial ( RCT ) . A parallel-design RCT ( one per diagnostic group ) conduct determine web-based sleep intervention NDD improve child 's sleep associate improved psychosocial outcome child caregiver . This study comprise development phase RCT phase . Phase 1 : Adaptation web-based intervention usability test . A 3-step process use adapt BNBD e-intervention use caregiver child NDD . Step 1 : Development modification base team lead input literature review , objective identify specific adaptation sleep intervention . The investigator conduct Delphi study gain consensus lead expert appropriate modification . Step 2 : Modification BNBD program . The investigator work BeHealth Solutions , company create BNBD web-program , adapt intervention caregiver child NDD . Modifications include change information already include BNBD , addition informational video . Step 3 : Usability study expert caregiver . The investigator evaluate e-intervention 6 dimension : usable , credible , accessible , desirable , useful , valuable . The investigator obtain participant ' perception whether caregiver well support e-intervention , incorporate additional support . Participants 5 health care professional work child NDD , 3 caregiver NDD group , maximum sample 17 . Phase 2 : RCT BNBD-NDD Sleep Intervention . In Phase 2 , investigator evaluate effectiveness web-based intervention insomnia 3 10-year-olds NDD . Assessments conduct Baseline 3 6 month post-randomization . The primary objective ass intervention 's immediate impact ( Baseline vs. 3 month ) child 's sleep . Th secondary objective evaluate longer-term impact ( Baseline , 3 , 6 month ) child 's sleep , well longer-term impact child caregiver psychosocial health outcome . Research Design . Investigators use RCT design , pragmatic trial approach , evaluate effectiveness intervention , adhere CONSORT 2010 guideline . Specifically , investigator conduct 4 individually randomize parallel-group RCTs , one NDD group ( ASD , FASD , CP &amp; ADHD ) , assess whether intervention improve child ' sleep within group 3 month . Data collect 6 month assess degree maintenance initial treatment effect child sleep , intervention 's impact child caregiver psychosocial health . Randomization . After Baseline caregiver randomize usual care internet-based sleep intervention ( BNBD-NDD ) . The usual care group may access intervention . They give access BNBD-NDD follow-up assessment . Caregivers intervention group also allow access intervention . The investigator use block-randomized stratification 3 age group ( preschooler [ 3-4years ] , early elementary [ 5-7years ] , mid-elementary [ 8-10years ] ) . A staff member ( affiliated project ) prepare computer-generated block randomization . Participants . The investigator recruit enough participant 60 caregiver complete post-treatment ( 3 month ) assessment 4 RCTs . Given likelihood overlap diagnose across group , participant enrol base primary impair disorder . The intervention design child mild-to-moderate disability , expect child severe neurologic disease benefit type intervention . Screening Assessment . Caregivers ask question online screen instrument ass whether child meet study 's inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion . To determine child behavioural insomnia , criterion outline Richman modify Anders Dahl , consistent Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) insomnia criterion , use . To determine child may sleep apnea ( exclusion item ) , caregiver complete Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire ( PSQ ) . Baseline Outcome Assessments . Assessments conduct Baseline 3 6 month post-randomization participant . A research assistant blind treatment condition email caregiver appropriate time request complete assessment , follow email answer question encourage completion form . The primary outcome measure total sleep duration base diary data actigraphy . Total sleep time variable consistently relate improved daytime functioning , psychological physical health . Secondary outcome examine change sleep variable ( i.e. , sleep onset sleep efficiency ) well change sleep variable 6-month trial duration , include questionnaire measure child 's sleep , caregiver ' daytime fatigue level , child 's caregiver ' psychosocial health ( behavioural emotional functioning ) .</detailed_description>
