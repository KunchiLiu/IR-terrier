	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect real world 30-day 1-year follow-up data patient undergoing TMR CardioGenesis Holmium : YAG Laser System either sole therapy procedure conjunction coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery . The primary objective study provide ongoing clinical data regard characteristic patient population undergo TMR community practice . Secondary objective include rate postoperative mortality MACE 30-days 1-year , benefit sustain improvement angina 30-days 1-year . The study include two patient population : - Registry Group : Patients select center previously participate ANGINA RELIEF Registry eligible one-year , prospective follow-up ; - Prospective Group : Up 100 new , prospectively enrol TMR patient select center .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CardioGenesis Transmyocardial Revascularization 1-Year Follow-Up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study objectives follow : - Track `` real world '' performance outcome physician experience use CardioGenesis Laser System ; - Further define disease characteristic population treat ; - Examine transmyocardial revascularization ( TMR ) usage characteristic , include surgical procedure information , 30-day 1-year outcome ; - Further assess risk factor adverse event 30-days 1-year ; - Further define MACE rate angina score 30-days 1-year . To limit potential bias , patient eligible TMR treatment meet Inclusion Exclusion Criteria offer opportunity enroll study participate center . Primary Endpoint : - 1-year Canadian Cardiovascular Society ( CCS ) angina class Secondary Endpoints : - All-cause mortality 30-day 1-year . - Rates major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) 30-days 1-year , defined incidence cardiac-related death , myocardial infarction ( Q-wave non Q-wave ) , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident , serious arrhythmia . The definition MACE event follow : - Cardiac-related death : death clearly attributable non-cardiac cause , include death due following : acute myocardial infarction , heart failure , cardiogenic shock , pulmonary edema , cardiac tamponade , arrhythmia , post-procedural complication ( i.e. , bleed ) . - Q-wave myocardial infarction : appearance new Q wave 40 millisecond 2 contiguous lead elevation CK-MB . - Non Q-wave myocardial infarction : elevation total CK twice normal elevated CK-MB . - Congestive heart failure : Symptoms pulmonary vascular congestion low output state due leave ventricular failure new onset result re-hospitalization . - Cerebrovascular accident : Any sudden development neurological deficit due vascular lesion brain hemorrhage , embolism , thrombosis persists &gt; 24 hour . - Serious arrhythmia : Supra-ventricular ventricular arrhythmia require sustain intravenous pharmacologic treatment , temporary permanent pacing , immediate electrical cardioversion defibrillation . Arrhythmias result syncope , myocardial ischemia , death also classify serious . - Any serious operative complication related procedure : example : major bleed require transfusion .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Registry Group : Previously enrol ANGINA RELIEF Registry ; Eligible 1year prospective followup ( date TMR procedure perform within 1218 month followup window ) . Prospective Group : Received TMR CardioGenesis Laser System ; Class IV angina ( accord Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Scale ) prior TMR ; Patients region myocardium distal twothirds leave ventricle reversible ischemia eligible direct coronary revascularization ( e.g. , CABG PTCA ) . Registry Group : Date ANGINA RELIEF Registry TMR procedure perform outside 1year ( 1218 month ) followup window . Prospective Group : Age le 18 year ; Severely unstable angina ( unweanable intravenous antianginals 48hours ) .</criteria>
