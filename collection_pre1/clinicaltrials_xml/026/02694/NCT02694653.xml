	<detailed_description>Research Protocol Preoperative Cesarean Section Intravenous Acetaminophen Postoperative Pain Control : A Blinded Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial Background : To date , study analyze use intravenous acetaminophen give preoperatively schedule cesarean delivery . There study non-obstetrical surgical procedure demonstrate good pain score less use opiates post surgery administer preoperatively . If study finding find equally effective post-cesarean delivery , few opiate would use mother . This would benefit good ambulation less bowel dysfunction mother less effect newborn mother breast-feeding . Acetaminophen one drug choice analgesia obstetrics , know effect mother fetus/newborn . The drug find safe give intravenously . Likewise , patient find therapeutic level drug give intravenously versus oral administration . Lastly , since patient NPO prior schedule surgery , give medication orally recommend . Of prospective blind study perform date , small number use range 20 28 arm . Intravenous acetaminophen already use preoperatively schedule cesarean section UT Medical Center Labor &amp; Delivery presumption nursing staff patient receive `` good '' post-delivery ( less pain less need oral opiate ) , without blind placebo-controlled trial , find proven report . Specific Aims : The primary aim study see maternal opiate use decrease postoperative period study group receive 1 gram acetaminophen prior schedule cesarean section . The secondary aim study evaluate length stay mother post-delivery study placebo group see difference . If find significant , analyzed cost effectiveness . Lastly , pain score evaluate determine improve preoperative acetaminophen . To date one ever study cord blood level acetaminophen follow administration close delivery , information normal acetaminophen level newborn available . Enrollment : Enrollment involve pregnant patient enter labor delivery schedule cesarean delivery study start total 150 obtain . Enrollment determine Primary physician involve study , nurse practitioners/research coordinator anesthesia obstetrical resident . Randomization : The study prospective randomize placebo control trial . Once patient consent , order medication supply Pharmacy Department . The Pharmacy Department supply mediation 100 mL bag infuse 15 minute prior incision . The Pharmacy randomly supply either placebo bag normal saline study drug 1000 mg ( 1 gram ) intravenous acetaminophen normal saline . No study personnel OB/GYN Anesthesia result study complete . The Pharmacy responsible maintain blinding study Study Procedure : All eligible pregnant patient ( describe ) admit labor delivery schedule cesarean delivery ask participate study . If meet inclusion criterion agree , approve informed consent form ( see attach ) sign . The goal obtain 150 patient . Once drug bag receive Pharmacy , infuse 15 minute , approximately 30 minute prior incision start time . All patient receive standard preoperative anesthesia antibiotic per protocol pain prevention surgical site infection . At delivery , cord blood obtain ( newborn NOT need blood draw ) sample go laboratory acetaminophen level fetus.In order maintain blinding , 150 cord blood sample send test result blindly report Pharmacy.Pharmacy personnel also keep cord blood level . No action pharmacy personnel monitor cord blood level necessary , cord blood therapeutic level available . This study seek discover information . Post-delivery , pain medication assessment score per UT Medical Center protocol perform postoperative/postpartum nurse assess pain control . Patients currently monitor Pharmacy acetaminophen level exceed 4000 mg/day process continue per hospital protocol . In order avoid break blind , study patient treat received preop acetaminophen switch non acetaminophen analgesic fifth dose acetaminophen require . After first 100 study patient enrol , preliminary study assessment perform see significance study goal ( ie : decreased opiate use , length stay improve pain score ) find since statistical difference see study few number . This information collect chart review investigator research assistant IRB approve . If data collection first 100 study patient find significant , study stop . However , blind maintain study completion determine . Adverse Event : Adverse event relate study minimal patient intravenous line place surgery whether consent . In addition , patient receive preoperative antibiotic prior surgical delivery receive medication fashion already do . Furthermore , obtain cord blood involve laboratory blood draw newborn . ( No study ever evaluate acetaminophen level cord blood though level newborn follow oral administration higher maternal level . The report patient level study toxic range follow single administration 1000 mg . Therefore , though never study , expect cord blood level therapeutic range . The molecular weight acetaminophen 151 Daltons bioavailability 75 % half-life 1 4 hour . Based parameter , drug would expect cross fetus fairly easily similar penicillin , create fairly steady state within mother fetus . ) Although adverse event expect either mother neonate , study investigator responsible monitoring adverse event become necessary . Evaluation maternal neonatal liver kidney function necessary mother receive one dose acetaminophen , 1000 gm , consider normal adult dose . Study Withdrawal : Any patient time ask withdrawn study . Statistics : A formal power analysis complete Dr. Eric Heidel 150 study subject show adequate study . Confidentiality : All patient material keep confidential patient-identifying information delete pain score , number opiate dosages receive , length stay participant , cord blood acetaminophen level record . The laboratory result send Pharmacy Department study completion keep process blind since cord blood sample test . Follow-up / Record Retention : No patient follow-up occur since purpose study basically determine preoperative medication protocol find beneficial short term post cesarean section . Record retention study result base rule peer-review journal accepts study publication .</detailed_description>
