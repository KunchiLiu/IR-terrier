	<detailed_description>Recruitment process conduct two part . During first part potential participant recruit : - At obesity centre current obesity consultation - During regularly information event obesity centre flyer hand . - During training course general practitioner obesity centre flyer hand . - Through network Medical AdiNetwork flyer send general practitioner . - Advertisement : via website Oviva , Berne University Applied Science , Zentrum für Adipositas- und Stoffwechselmedizin Winterthur ( ZAS ) GmbH ; Newspaper `` Winterthur Stadt Anzeiger '' . Participants receive write verbal information study . After participant give informed consent participation second phase ( screen process ) take place . The researcher determine eligibility participant base inclusion exclusion criterion Zentrum für Adipositas- und Stoffwechselmedizin Winterthur GmbH . Description variable : Weight : Measurement take place morning , use clinically validate calibrate scale ( Seca mBCA 515 , medical Body Composition Analyzer ) . The participant clothe lightly , without shoe . Weight record within 0.01 kg . BMI calculate divide body weight ( kilogram ) height ( meter ) 2 Height measure use calibrate stadiometer ( Forma Seca ) . The subject stand erect foot position floor board stadiometer . Heels , buttock , back head touch back board stadiometer arm side . Waist circumference : For measurement tape locate midway low rib iliac crest . Each measurement perform twice record within 0.5 cm . If difference measurement great 1 cm , third measurement perform , mean two close measurement calculate . The participant stand foot close together , wear little clothing , relax , measurement take end normal expiration . Body fat measure Bioelectrical impedance analysis ( Seca mBCA 515 , medical Body Composition Analyzer ) . Participants ask eat , drink , smoke sport 1h BIA measurement . They also ask consume caffeine alcohol drug 24 hour . Bladder empty measurement . Participants lightly dress measurement wear tights . Measurement Standing . Laboratory parameter : Subjects fast night ( 8 hour ) , abstain smoking , alcohol ingestion , caffeine-containing beverage , vigorous exercise 48 h experiment . The investigator insert one venous catheter large antecubital vein blood sample week 0 , 12 52 . Blood glucose : fill small fluoride contain tube put aside refrigerator 5°C . Standard value : &lt; 5.6 mmol/l . HbA1c : fill small EDTA contain tube put aside refrigerator 5°C . Standard value : &lt; 5.6 % . Triglyceride : filling special tube centrifugation ( 10 min 6000 rpm ) extraction blood serum put aside refrigerator 5°C . Standard value : &lt; 2.26 mmol/l . Insulin : filling special tube centrifugation ( 10 min 6000 rpm ) extraction blood serum put aside refrigerator 5°C . Standard value : 2.6-24.9 mIU/l . HDL-Cholesterol : filling special tube centrifugation ( 10 min 6000 rpm ) extraction blood serum put aside refrigerator 5°C . Standard value : &gt; 1.69 mmol/l ( cardiovascular risk ) ; 1.15-1.68 mmol/l ( moderate cardiovascular risk ) ; &lt; 1.14 mmol/l ( high cardiovascular risk ) Beta-HCG fill serum tube seperating gel .

Vital sign : Blood pressure heart rate investigate method Riva Rocci special measuring instrument ( Firma boso-medicus SN 768 00 440 729 Bosch+Sohn GmbH und Co ) stethoscope . The patient sit 15 min . These measurement carry 3 time row mean value use . Statistical Analysis The following statistical hypothesis test primary outcome : Null hypothesis : Change weight baseline week 52 = 0 Alternative hypothesis : Change weight baseline week 52 ≠ 0 The sample size calculation base statistical hypothesis . Using two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test significance level 0.05 power 80 % , sample size 36 need detect weight change baseline week 52 0.5 standard deviation , correspond medium effect size accord Cohen . To account drop-outs 50 patient enrol study The following analysis population use : - Intention-to-treat ( ITT ) Population . - Per protocol ( PP ) Population . The primary outcome analyze base ITT population . A supportive analysis base PP population perform . For primary outcome , change weight calculate baseline week 52 . The null hypothesis test use two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test significance level 0.05 . All outcome analyze base ITT population . Supportive analysis base PP population perform . For secondary outcome change calculate baseline specify time point . The change whole observation period investigate use non-parametric ANOVA method longitudinal data . Post-hoc test change measure time point may perform use Wilcoxon signed-rank test . Correlations outcome variable investigate use Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient . Two-tailed test significance level 0.05 used analysis . No adjustment multiple test perform . All outcome variable summarize use descriptive statistic . All analysis perform use late version R ( http : //www.r-project.org ) . No imputation miss data perform . A row denote `` Missing '' include count tabulation necessary account drop-outs miss value . For continuous variable column number available observation add . Patients lose follow-up reaching primary outcome replace . The expected drop-out rate account sample size calculation . Data Management - smartphone assist coaching : Data entry user ( patient dietitian ) always validate use predefined pattern range check . If reason something go wrong user inform unsuccessful data entry might ( depend severity error ) force login respective system assert inconsistent state display user . Data keep consistent validity check define dietitian store highly structured consistency-constrained database host medical infrastructure provider . - On-site clinical data management : All data acquire 2 person ( study nurse clinical subinvestigator ) electronically immigrate different equipment electronically database . Data extract CRF data analysis . The patient key list archive clinic site , PI insight . - All electronic data transfer via secure connection store secure facility , accord regulation sensitive private information . Adverse serious adverse event expect kind intervention . But happen , event describe CRF , may happen non-causal . Quality assurance : All study personnel instruct PI study procedure . The PI furthermore ensure on-going correct data collection obesity center Sponsor ensure Oviva technical functionality coach operation . All study data archive minimum 10 year study termination premature termination clinical trial . Follow standardize procedure accordance provision blood sample generally store 5 degree celsius . Default storage : Blood sample ( EDTA ) seven day ; Blood serum one year . Afterwards , blood sample destroy . If subject withdraws consent , blood sample analyze afterwards destroy immediately . Data analyze anonymised . Monitoring : The monitor visit PI study centre periodic interval , addition maintain necessary telephonic write communication . The monitor maintain current personal knowledge study observation , review study record source documentation discussion conduct study PI study team . - An initiation visit perform start recruitment ensure site personnel thoroughly train site provide clinical trial supply . - The first monitoring visit conduct March 2016 shortly first participant enrol ensure criterion inclusion exclusion meet protocol procedure follow appropriately . All patient enrol verified meet inclusion criterion . - Subsequent monitoring visit : Study Site monitor approximately 3 time depend demand study ( week 12 , week 52 , week 104 ) . - Closure Study : A Site Close-Out Visit conduct participant complete study query answer . At visit monitor ensure trial documentation place , discuss archive procedure site . - Communication visit : Between monitor visit , investigator telephone regularly monitor verify patient enrolment status , review study progress , answer protocol question , CRF completion status query , ensure study proceeds timely manner . Change Management : Basically , study conduct compliance study protocol . If deviation necessary , like change eligibility criterion , study design , recruitment , assessment , intervention , outcomes , analysis ) propose amendment submit well-founded sponsor . All investigator make write suggestion regard consult principal investigator . A write consent obtain sponsor . Substantial amendment implement approval CEC . Under emergency circumstance , deviation protocol protect right , safety well-being human subject may proceed without prior approval sponsor CEC .
