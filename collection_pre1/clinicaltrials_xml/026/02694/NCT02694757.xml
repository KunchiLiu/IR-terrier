	<brief_title>Efficacy Ostom-i Alert System Decreasing Dehydration Related Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ileostomy creation common surgery perform patient disease injury colon require fecal diversion . Ileostomy formation temporary , often use protect anastomosis colorectal resection . It also permanent , disease injury extensive . All patient undergo ileostomy face unique post-operative challenge due alteration absorption waste elimination pathway . Prior surgery , patient counsel challenge include expected increase frequency liquid stool , bothersome serious complication . Hospital readmission people recently undergone colon rectal surgery frequent , costly delay post-operative healing . Current NSQIP colectomy readmission rate open laparoscopic colectomies past 12 month Massachusetts General Hospital 11.3 % 10.9 % respectively . Average national readmission rate open laparoscopic colectomies past 12 month 13.2 % 10.7 % respectively . The common reason hospital readmission follow surgery dehydration , cause include infection , bowel obstruction , bleeding , wind dehiscence leak , pain . Dehydration serious preventable complication patient new ileostomy . Even small change fluid intake output cause body fluid imbalance promote dehydration necessitate IV rehydration . Previous research show use pre-operative teaching , direct patient engagement post-op day one , engage patient perform self-care stoma hospitalization , patient track intake output post-discharge decrease readmission rate . With implementation pathway course 7 month , decrease overall 30- day postdischarge readmission rate patient new ileostomy 35.4 % 21.4 % , rate dehydration alone fall 15.5 % 0 % . The Ostom-i alert ( OIA ) discrete novel device clip onto ostomy bag edge edge measure horizontal tension edge time , result stool volume ostomy . It FDA approve medical device . Until , OIA mainly use warn patient ostomy bag risk overflow thereby reduce risk leakage cause embarrassment patient caregiver . It also use evaluate overall output ostomy . When patient leave hospital , OIA data send patient 's smartphone bluetooth technology view internet real time surgical team ( stoma nurse , surgeon , clinical research staff ) . This would allow patient monitor output accurately allow contact clinical staff question help bowel management output outside establish parameter ( little high output ) . While patient ileostomy risk dehydration , early identification great risk may lead home intervention decrease hospital readmission . Decreased readmission ultimately lead faster post-operative recovery , decrease risk sequela readmission ( nosocomial infection , pneumonia etc ) decrease healthcare cost .</detailed_description>
