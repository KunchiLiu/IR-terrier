	<brief_summary>Background : Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) brain infection people weaken immune system . Researchers think polyoma virus specific T cell ( PyVST ) therapy treat PML . The PyVST cell make blood cell healthy relative . They grow lab expand virus-killing cell , give person PML . Objective : To test whether PyVST safely treat PML . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 old PML - Healthy adult age 18 older : - Been screen protocol 97-H-0041 - A sibling , parent , child PML match cell Design : - Participants screen : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood urine test - PML participant also screen : - Cerebrospinal fluid remove needle back . - MRI : A dye inject vein . They lie table slide cylinder . - Questionnaires Healthy participant apheresis : Blood flow needle one arm machine separate blood cell need donation . The rest blood return needle arm . Some participant may central line place vein instead . They apheresis 3 time , least 28 day apart . Participants PML receive PyVST cell needle arm . They stay hospital 1 week . They 3 time , least 28 day apart . After infusion , weekly visit 1 month . Then 4 visit 1 year . Visits include repeat screen test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective This pilot clinical trial aim determine feasibility potential toxicity associate treat patient progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) polyomavirus ( PyV ) -specific partially match polyclonal allogeneic T cell . It provide initial efficacy data indication . Study Population Up 18 subject definite PML , define clinical sign MRI compatible active PML presence JCV PCR CSF . Subjects must 18 year age old must first degree , partially HLA- match relative able willing act donor lymphocytes . Subjects underlie reversible immunosuppression ( i.e.- HIV MS status post treatment natalizumab ) , subject uncontrolled malignancy exclude . Subjects evidence active CNS inflammation determine presence significant contrast enhancement within PML lesion MRI also exclude assumed patient already mount adequate immune response infection . Design This first-in-human pilot study assess feasibility toxicity profile NIH PyVST cellular product subject PML . Subjects screen exist NIH Natural History study PML ( 13-N-0017 ) . Sequential enrollment space least 28 day apart . An initial fix dose PyVST infusion ( target dose 1 x 10^6 PyVST/kg ( +/- 10 % ) ) administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion , follow 2x10^6 PyVST/kg ( +/-10 % ) 2 time subject need . Outcome Measures Safety monitor 28 day continuously stop rule base treatment-related serious adverse event rate . Secondary outcome include survival , assessed day 28 1 year follow last infusion . CSF viral titer , MR imaging , clinical disability scale also collect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENT : Clinically definite PML , define clinical sign MRI compatible active PML presence JCV PCR CSF Modified Rankin Scale 14 , inclusive Age 18 old Patient medically stable able tolerate travel NIH Available PyVST Subjects childbearing childfathering potential must willing use medically acceptable form birth control , include abstinence , treat study Willing able participate aspect trial design followup Able provide inform consent EXCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENT : Patients human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV infection ) Patients treated natalizumab Patients readily reversible immunosuppressive state Patients receive immunosuppressive immunomodulatory therapy within 28 day screen enrollment could interfere PyVST function Patients uncontrolled infection . For bacterial infection , patient must receive definitive therapy sign progress infection 72 hour prior enrollment . For fungal infection , patient must receive definitive systemic antifungal therapy sign progress infection 1 week prior enrollment . Patients receive donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) within 28 day Uncontrolled relapse malignancy Patients associate CNS disease might confound outcome Patients contraindication MRI ( include cardiac pacemaker infusion pump , metallic implant , metallic foreign object ) MRI finding consistent immune system reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) determine mount adequate immune response infection Patients medical contraindication LP For subject previously receive PyVST infusion , treatmentlimiting toxicity ( defined Section 8.3 ) previous infusion Subjects positive pregnancy test nursing . INCLUSION CRITERIA DONOR : Screening procedure complete protocol 97H0041 Ability provide inform consent time enrollment First degree relative patient ( sibling , parent/child ) Partial HLA compatibility patient ( least one HLA class I one HLA class II match ) Age 18 old EXCLUSION CRITERIA DONOR : Sickling hemoglobinopathy include HbSS HbSC history peripheral blood smear ; donor HbAS acceptable HbsAg , antiHBc , antiHCV , antiHIV , antiHTLV , RPR Cardiovascular instability , severe anemia , inadequate venous access , severe coagulation disorder medical condition Principal Investigator Apheresis Unit staff considers contraindication apheresis procedure research blood draw .
