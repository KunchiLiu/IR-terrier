	<brief_summary>This cross-sectional observational study aim examine compare impact incretin base therapy i.e . dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP4 ) inhibitor glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) analogue , endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) mobilise factor , stromal derive factor-1 α ( SDF-1 α ) , patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) well establish treatment . EPCs provide vascular protection mean endothelial repair neogenesis . This endothelial protective effect may potentially benefit patient affected micro macrovascular complication arise vascular injury e.g . cardiovascular disease T2DM . The study particular interest small study show increase level circulate EPC patient treat DPP-4 inhibitor , think mediate via regulation mobilise factor SDF-1 α .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Glucose Lowering Therapies Circulating Endothelial Progenitor Cells Its Mobilising Factor Stromal Derived Factor-1α Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes chronic condition report affect 366 million people globally 2011 estimate rise 552 million 2030 worldwide , i.e . one 10 adult . In UK alone , prevalence 4.5 % approximately 5 million people project affected 2025 . Of entire population people diabetes , Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) constitute 90 % . In United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) , 50 % people T2DM present micro and/or macrovascular complication time diagnosis . It well establish people T2DM also 4 5 time great risk cardiovascular complication compare general population , account 80 % mortality . Thus , burden diabetes associate complication health care service enormous . Prescribing medication complication associate diabetes alone cost 3 4 time cost medication manage diabetes National Health Service ( NHS ) . Thus , therapy simultaneously target glycaemic control diabetic complication particularly cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) independent glucose lower effect desirable . The current study aim evaluate therapeutic effect incretin base therapy ( DPP-4 inhibitor versus GLP-1 analogue ) incretin base therapy versus non-incretin base treatment level EPCs , SDF-1α biomarkers patient T2DM establish treatment ( receive &gt; 3 month ) . Study objectives To investigate treatment DPP-4 inhibitor patient T2DM associate increased level Endothelial Progenitor Cells ( EPCs ) Stromal Derived Factor-1 α ( SDF-1α ) compare receive GLP-1 analogue cross sectional analysis adjust confounders . Further , study aim determine treatment incretin base therapy associate high circulating level EPC SDF1-α compare non-incretin base therapy . Preparation Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMCs ) subsequent EPC quantification PBMCs collect use standard technique . In brief PBMCs isolate venous blood collect 9.7ml sodium heparin blood tube ( subsequently store room temperature 4 hour ) . The blood sample centrifuge ( 1500g 10 min 4⁰C ) plasma layer collect later biomarker analysis ( aliquots plasma frozen -80⁰C use ) . The buffy coat layer ( white opaque layer lie directly red cell pellet ) use PBMC isolation . To isolate PBMCs , buffy coat centrifuge 400g Ficoll gradient ( 1.077g/ml ) 30 minute result cellular layer undergo 3 wash ( 300g 10 minute 20g 10 minute X2 ) wash cell deplete platelet . To calculate number PBMC isolate , pellet suspend know volume Phosphate Buffered Solution ( PBS ) ( 1ml ) small quantity ( 10µl ) assess quantity viability invert microscope use haemocytometer vital stain ( Trypan blue ) . To prevent inter-assay variation due longitudinal sample collection , sample store liquid nitrogen vapour ( use standard freezing protocol ) quantification EPCs perform one batch store sample . Quantification EPC EPCs quantify cell show dual positivity cell surface / transmembrane marker : Cluster Differentiation 24 ( CD24 ) Kinase Domain Receptor ( KDR ) . Standardized flow cytometry protocol employ . In brief , cell thaw immunofluorescent cell stain perform use fluorescent conjugate antibody : CD34-fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) KDR-phycoerythrin ( PE ) . For patient , correspond negative control IgG2a-FITC-PE process . The number circulate EPCs express term total number cell display dual positivity CD24 KDR per µl blood originally process . Biomarkers SDF-1α analysis analysis biomarkers associate prevalence circulate EPCs measure use sandwich ELISA multi-array ELISA technology in-line manufacturer protocol . Analysis endogenous DPP4 assay use commercial colorimetric assay ; manufacturer protocols follow . Biomarker DPP4 analysis carry one batch store sodium heparin plasma sample . Statistics Statistical method analysis Baseline characteristic display group ( currently receive DPP-4 inhibitor , currently receive GLP-1analogue , currently use DPP-4 inhibitor GLP-1 analogue ) mean standard deviation normally distribute continuous variable , median interquartile range non-normally distribute continuous variable , count percentages categorical variable . The primary outcome ( EPC ) compare treatment group use linear regression , without adjustment potential confounders . The confounders consider age , gender , ethnicity , body mass index , duration T2DM insulin treatment . The mean EPC 95 % confidence interval three group present well mean difference DPP-IV v GLP-1 treatment group incretin vs non-incretin treatment group . A similar analysis use continuous secondary outcome . Binary outcome compare group use logistic regression analysis without adjustment confounders . All statistical test 2 side p &lt; 0.05 take statistically significant . Sample size Based power 80 % significance 0.025 ( allow two primary comparison , i.e . DPP-IV vs GLP-1 user incretin user vs non-incretin user ) , 216 patient ( 72 three group ) require detect difference 10 EPC/μl assume SD 19.2 power 24 . This sample size also allow difference 8 pg/ml SDF-1α detect 75 % power assume SD 16 power 24 . Data management Data collection sheet management All clinical data store secure area Leicester Diabetes Centre . Each enrol subject allocate unique study identification number ( ID ) electronic database remain anonymous . The Data Collection Form ( Case report Form , CRF ) primary data collection instrument .

All electronic data store secure university ( University Leicester ) hospital ( University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust ) network drive , relevant study staff access , grant research team . All study document data keep 5 year minimum determine regulatory authority , whichever longer . The study file archive line Trust policy . Data confidentiality Each participant assign unique identification number upon recruitment . Patients ' contact detail hold separate database use arrange study visit . The database password protect member research team contact patient access . All data collect study store anonymously separate database . Again access password protect restricted relevant member research team . Electronic data store University NHS system . Safety Issues The Investigators foresee adverse event associate everyday life routine health care could attributable study . The study involve one venepuncture withdraw venous blood hence carry low risk untoward effect . However , participant undergo venepuncture occasionally result bruising , swell temporary discomfort . The Investigators follow University Leicester guideline manage report Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction ( SUSAR ) , follow outline Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guidance . A SAE adverse event unexpected adverse reaction result death life-threatening require hospitalisation prolongation exist hospitalisation result persistent significant disability incapacity consist congenital anomaly birth defect . In addition , Investigators also define event serious important significant medical event may immediately life threaten result death hospitalisation , base upon appropriate medical judgement may jeopardise patient may require intervention prevent one outcomes list . Adverse event fall category define non-serious . All SAEs report internally University Hospitals Leicester ( UHL ) NHS Trust Research &amp; Development ( R &amp; D ) sponsor ( University Leicester ) use appropriate reporting form , within 24 hour study team become aware event . The principal investigator responsible review submission SAE , absence , another member team ( order avoid delay ) . The investigator site file contain documentation SAE report evidence timely submission .</detailed_description>
