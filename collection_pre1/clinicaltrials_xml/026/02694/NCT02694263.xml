	<brief_title>Canagliflozin ( Invokana™ ) vs. Standard Dual Therapy Regimen T2DM During Ramadan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There one billion Muslims world majority participate Ramadan . The prevalence diabetes several country large Muslim population similar rate observe westernised country , increase 10 % annually result urbanization socioeconomic development . Observance Ramadan integral part Islamic identity one five main pillar constitute widely follow religion . Muslims observe Ramadan require fast sunrise sunset holy month . The timing Ramadan follow lunar calendar occur 10 day earlier year ; mean fasting period coincides summer season many consecutive year move line winter month . During summer season Ramadan take place long hour daylight great impact risk people diabetes fast period . Although Quran exempt `` sick '' people duty fast many Muslims diabetes consider sick keen fast . A recent epidemiological study involve 13 Islamic country report 43 % patient Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) 79 % people type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) fast religious period . Concern Muslims diabetes fast Ramadan recognise religious leader indeed 2009 saw landmark event . A statement issue meet Council International Islamic Fiqh Academy Organisation Islamic Conference 19th session . In brief , people diabetes classify four category line expert recommendation publish 2005 . Categories 1 2 include diabetes high risk serious complication high risk complication due fasting , respectively . These two group exempt observe Ramadan . Categories 3 4 include diabetes medium risk complication low risk complication due fasting , respectively . The latter two group automatically exempt observe Ramadan . The risk complication context refers specifically likelihood hypoglycaemic event , include acute illness associate diabetes , patient renal dialysis , woman diabetes pregnancy , patient macrovascular disease , live alone insulin therapy oral insulin secretagogues . Additionally , people T1DM class category 1 . However , impact feast part Ramadan , example hyperglycaemia deterioration glycaemic control , consider statement . Furthermore , know extent guideline follow practice . There abundance evidence describe impact Ramadan people T2DM retrospective population-based study . However , lack evidence available help guide management people diabetes wish observe Ramadan . Fasting feast holy month cause health risk people diabetes . The Epidemiology Diabetes Ramadan 1422/2001 Study ( `` EPIDAR '' ) large population-based , international epidemiological study diabetes conduct 13 country Muslim population . One aim study determine potential effect fast people diabetes well-being management condition . They observe 7.5-fold ( 0.4 3 event per 100 per month ) increase risk severe hypoglycaemia patient T2DM result change eat pattern Ramadan . Severe hypoglycaemia define hypoglycaemia lead hospitalization . Additionally 5-fold increase incidence severe hyperglycaemia with/without ketoacidosis observe patient T2DM . Other risk people diabetes fast Ramadan include diabetic ketoacidosis due lack insulin , dehydration due lack fluid intake fasting period , orthostatic hypotension addition increase risk thrombosis due increase blood viscosity secondary dehydration . Only 62 % T2DM `` EIPDAR '' study report receive recommendation health care provider . These recommendation include change lifestyle ( diet physical activity ) medication choice dosage limit potential complication fast feast patient population . There significant advance glucose lower therapy T2DM availability , thus offer great choice therapy people diabetes potential support safer fasting . Three new class therapy license treatment T2DM United Kingdom ( UK ) past 10 year . The recent class introduce Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitors ( SGLT2 inhibitor ) . There six known member SGLT family date . Canagliflozin ( Invokana™ ) , daily tablet , one number SGLT2 inhibitor license within UK . This medication take daily orally ( either 100 300mg ) . Phase III trial novel agent report reduction HbA1c 0.70 1.16 % , body weight reduction 1.8 3.7 % systolic blood pressure reduction 1.6 6.6mmHg ( millimetre mercury ) baseline . Canagliflozin ( Invokana™ ) low intrinsic propensity cause hypoglycaemia . Importantly drug report well-tolerated good safety profile patient inadequately control T2DM monotherapy combination glucose lower therapy include sulphonylureas metformin . In 2016 , Ramadan take place throughout month June July . At time year UK , dawn sunset approximately 14.5 hour daylight begin 13 hour towards end Ramadan fasting . This significant portion 24 hour day ; thus abstinence food prolonged period pose increase risk T2DM especially medicine regimen alter accommodate . In light study aim determine addition Canagliflozin ( Invokana™ ) therapy monotherapy metformin effective achieve double composite endpoint reduction HbA1c ( ≥ 0.3 % ) weight loss ( ≥1kg ) 3-4 week post-Ramadan . The study also include patient currently dual therapy , specifically metformin plus sulphonylurea , pioglitazone repaglinide determine whether switch metformin plus Canagliflozin ( Invokana™ ) effective achieve composite endpoint compare remain previous dual therapy . There number secondary outcome include weight loss , rate hypoglycaemia , blood pressure number biochemical endpoint . The study also include objective measure glycaemic status use Flash Glucose Monitoring System ( FGMS ) call `` FreeStyle Libre '' sensor sub-set participant ( 15-20 participant ) . Participants 'opt-in ' FGMS sub-study device worn medication initiate first follow-up visit 3-4 week post Ramadan . The study also invite participate sub-study wear device Ramadan . The use FGMS provide 14 day blood glucose reading take every 15 minute allow u apply glycaemic threshold upload data calculate proportion time spend hypo , hyper normoglycaemic state two treatment group . There limited evidence change level physical activity people observe Ramadan . It widely believe level physical activity reduce due fear feel weak [ 29 ] . To address , study objectively measure physical activity level , Ramadan sub-set participant ( 15-20 participant ) addition use self-reported validated international physical activity questionnaire ( IPAQ ) . It hypothesise therapy base Canagliflozin ( Invokana™ ) effective sulphonylurea-based regimen help people establish T2DM observe Ramadan achieve double composite endpoint reduction HbA1c ( ≥ 0.3 % ) weight loss ( ≥1kg ) 3-4 week post-Ramadan .

STATISTICS Description Statistical Methods : - Participants recruit study compare randomise group respect baseline characteristic pre-Ramadan characteristic . Numbers ( percentage ) binary categorical variable mean ( standard deviation ) , median ( low upper quartile ) continuous variable present . There test statistical significance confidence interval difference randomise group baseline variable . The primary outcome study achievement double composite endpoint reduction HbA1c ( ≥ 0.3 % ) weight loss ( ≥1kg ) 3-4 week post-Ramadan . All analyse outcome data carry complete case basis accord randomise group . As sensitivity analysis , primary main secondary outcome , multiple imputation use perform intention treat analysis . The investigator also conduct per protocol analysis exclude report longer take randomised treatment two follow-up . All analysis perform assess change follow time period : - Baseline 3-4 post-Ramadan data constitute primary analysis - Pre-Ramadan 3-4 week post-Ramadan ±2 week - Baseline 12 week post-Ramadan ±2 week - Baseline 12 month post-baseline ±6 week The primary outcome analyse use logistic regression adjust stratification factor ( site , entry therapy ( ( 1 ) monotherapy ( 2 ) dual therapy metformin plus pioglitazone ( 3 ) dual therapy metformin plus either sulphonylurea repaglinide ) ) . The dependent variable define achieve composite end point target . The analysis method use secondary composite outcome . The biomedical outcome analyse use linear regression adjust stratification factor baseline value . Ordinal regression use compare treatment group treatment satisfaction score . Linear regression use total metabolic equivalent ( total METs ) . The percentage patient experience one self-reported hypoglycaemic event diary ( define blood glucose level ≤3.9 mmol/l ) report group along median ( Inter Quartile Range ) number episode per patient . The incidence rate hypoglycaemia per person year calculate per group compare use incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) . Continuous Glucose Monitoring System ( CGMS ) data collect 3 time point . The mean proportion ( % ) time spend either ( ≥10mmol/l ) , ( ≤3.1mmol/l ) within ( 3.2-9.9mmol/l ) - predefined glycaemic range - calculate participant record period adjust 24 hour . The study compare treatment group time-point . The investigator calculate change proportion time spent category pre-Ramadan post-Ramadan within group . The investigator compare identify glycaemic shift treatment group . The investigator calculate number Continuous Glucose Monitor ( CGM ) low glucose event ( ≤3.1 ≤2.2mmol/L ) CGM high glucose event ( ≥10.0mmol/L ) within treatment group determine incidence change across three time point . The Number Participants : - The sample size require detect minimum clinical significant difference 27.7 % achieve primary outcome treatment arm 116 participant ( n=58 per group ) , 80 % power alpha 5 % , assume dropout rate 20 % . This base 21.2 % SU plus metformin group 'Treat 4 Ramadan study ' meet propose primary outcome achieve double composite endpoint reduction HbA1c ( ≥0.3 % ) weight loss ( ≥ 1kg ) 3-4 week post-Ramadan . The Level Statistical Significance : - All analysis carry Stata ( version 12.0 ) 95 % confidence interval report p &lt; 0.05 relate statistical significance . Procedure Accounting Missing , Unused , Spurious Data : - Data enter database real-time validation , limit spurious data . Before analysis begin data check anomaly check source data . During data collection study team attempt minimise miss data item . Participants miss data exclude case-wise basis , i.e. , analysis require miss item . The primary main secondary outcome analyse complete case basis use multiple imputation estimate effect miss data .
