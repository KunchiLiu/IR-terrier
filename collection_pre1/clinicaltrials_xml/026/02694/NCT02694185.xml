	<brief_summary>Ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) treatment carry profound public health economic implication . Among Veterans , IHD represent one common cause death disability , 500,000 affected individual ' annually . Rheumatic disease , though far less common IHD affect multiple organ system require therapy cost excess $ 50,000 year . Optimal treatment Veterans IHD rheumatic disease require number medication maintain improve health . Not take medication prescribe , however , common increase risk subsequent adverse event ( cardiac death myocardial infarction [ MI ] ) . To improve medication adherence rate cardiac health Veterans IHD , investigator propose test medication adherence intervention . Known VA SEPPRMACI-ARM ( Secondary Event Prevention use Population Risk Management After PCI Anti-Rheumatic Medications ) , intervention consist : proactive real-time adherence monitoring patient target individual refill medication give number day due refill . The intervention employ tailor , escalating-intensity approach begin combination personalize short messaging service ( SMS ) text message interactive voice response ( IVR ) telephone technology , depend patient preference . Patients complete SMS IVR refill medication ( decline SMS complete IVR ) escalate train research interventionalist . The interventionalist contact patient address adherence barrier base dimension outline World Health Organization ( WHO ) specific patient . The investigator test intervention IHD patient recently undergone PCI-a cardiac procedure commonly use among IHD patient improve heart 's blood flow patient start anti-rheumatic medication . The investigator test intervention four VA Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories ( CCLs ) 12 site serve usual care control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Secondary Event Prevention Using Population Risk Management After PCI Anti-Rheumatic Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) rheumatic disease pervasive , expensive , result grave health consequence . IHD affect estimate 15.4 million Americans 20 year age-representing 6.4 % adult population . The direct indirect cost IHD estimate $ 195.2 billion , double cost project 2030.5 Similarly , direct cost U.S. workforce rheumatoid arthritis alone approach $ 5.8 billion yearly . Widely-accepted national evidence-based guideline support use cardio-protective medication reduce risk adverse consequence result IHD disease modify anti-rheumatic medication ( DMARDs ) reduce risk adverse consequence rheumatic disease . For example , numerous rigorously conduct randomized trial show statins improve outcome reduce mortality patient establish cardiovascular disease ( i.e. , secondary prevention ) , include undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The use statins beta-blockers repeatedly demonstrate cost-effective lowering cardiovascular event ( CVE ) rate , part effect cholesterol , blood pressure , respectively . Accordingly , recent VA performance measure American Heart Association guideline encourage use statins patient atherosclerotic disease ; beta-blockers subject leave ventricular systolic dysfunction ( ejection fraction le 40 % ) , prior MI , blood pressure 140/90 great ; clopidogrel follow acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) PCI stent . The rheumatology literature provide similar evidence benefit DMARDs rheumatic disease , guideline strongly endorse use . Unfortunately , non-adherence medication common , increase risk poor outcome . The investigator ' 2011 national preliminary data VA cardiac catheterization laboratory ( CCLs ) demonstrate 6300 patient experience least one refill gap &gt; = 7 day statin year follow PCI . The mean proportion day cover ( PDC ) patient 75 % -below PDC threshold 80 % typical defines adherent patient , base empiric evidence effectiveness medication cut-point . Non-adherent patient present CCLs without substantial variation mean PDC center , suggest global problem . Systematic problem underlie contribute non-adherence medication . Usual care IHD rheumatic disease patient encumber systematic deficiency include : passive monitoring ( contact patient initiated patient ) inefficiency ( time-consuming patient-by-patient approach , rather population management ) . The propose intervention address complex patient-specific factor ( emphasize forgetfulness carelessness ) systematic inadequacy use multi-modal , escalate approach . Objectives 1 . To assess effectiveness multi-faceted patient-centered intervention versus usual care improve medication adherence measure proportion day cover ( PDC , primary outcome ) . This test among IHD patient statin , beta-blockers clopidogrel year PCI among rheumatology clinic patient chronically prescribed DMARDs . Hypothesis : The PDC patient intervention arm exceed PDC usual care arm 10 % absolute difference . 2 . ( Secondary outcome ) : To determine effectiveness multi-faceted patient-centered intervention versus usual care reduce secondary CVEs ( myocardial infarction [ MI ] , repeat revascularization [ PCI coronary bypass graft ] , all-cause mortality ) among IHD patient 12 month post-PCI progressive erosive disease demonstrate plain film radiograph patient rheumatic disease ( i.e . `` radiographic progression '' ) . Hypothesis : The rate CVEs radiographic progression 5 % relatively low patient intervention arm compare usual care . 3 . ( Secondary outcome ) : To establish cost implement maintain intervention , cost usual care , well incremental cost effectiveness ( ICE ; e.g . cost achieve 10 % improvement PDC ; cost per CVE prevent ) . Hypothesis : This aim posit hypothesis objective descriptive . The available funding project limit outcome IHD patient ( rheumatic disease patient analyze accord cost ) .</detailed_description>
