	<brief_title>Human Faecal Microbiota Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gut microbiota refers bacterial community gastrointestinal tract . The diversity quantity bacteria vary depend age individual , daily diet segment intestine , make gut microbiota one complex bacterial ecosystem know men . In general , trillion bacteria reside human gut . Recent evidence indicate gut microbiota could involve host metabolism multiple pathway lead development obesity type 2 diabetes . Increased fat storage obesity become one lead public health issue many develop develop country . However , clear whether type 2 diabetes associate unique gut microbiota profile . Therefore , primary objective study compare fecal microbiota overweight type 2 diabetic subject age , gender BMI match subject well lean non-diabetic subject . In addition , investigator hypothesize microbiota modification consumption fiber rich food product improve metabolic outcome type 2 diabetic . To test hypothesis , investigator plan provide overweight participant two cereal bar per day 4 week . Anthropometric measurement plasma parameter well fecal microbiota determine .</detailed_description>
