	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Efficacy Safety Neihulizumab v `` Conventional Treatment '' Treat Sr-aGvHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This current Phase II trial randomize , open label , control , multiple dose , multi-centre study study clinical efficacy safety Neihulizumab v `` Conventional Treatment '' treat steroid-refractory acute graft-vs-host disease ( sr-aGvHD ) patient undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . This study enroll minimum 90 patient , approximately 60 Neihulizumab treatment arm 30 Conventional treatment control arm . The primary objective evaluate efficacy Neihulizumab treatment patient steroid-refractory acute GvHD compare `` conventional treatment . '' The secondary objective investigate safety , pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity Neihulizumab administration subject steroid-refractory acute GvHD . For safety evaluation , parameter assess adverse event ( AEs ) , discontinuation therapy due AEs , safety laboratory analysis , ECG , vital sign , physical examination , immunogenicity .</detailed_description>
