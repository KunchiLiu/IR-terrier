	<detailed_description>Background : Increase lactate level ( hyperlactataemia ) common critically ill patient sensitive marker early identification patient critically ill . Blood lactate also predictor clinical outcome . High level lactate associate high mortality well increased morbidity . Capillary blood sample easy collect , less painful , measurement use handheld device may allow rapid determination test result ED . This rapid lactate measurement could aid early recognition patient high risk mortality morbidity . However , accuracy rapid capillary lactate measurement use handheld device well studied ED patient . Objective : To study accuracy capillary blood level measure handheld lactate analyzer compare reference method e.g.venepuncture blood gas analyzer sample . Study design : This prospective observational study patient present ED Prince Wales Hospital ( PWH ) . Patients age 18 triage category 3 present ED recruit . Capillary venous blood sample collect . Venous lactate level measure blood gas analyzer ( Siemens Automatic QC RAPID Systems RAPID Point @ 500 ) two hand-held lactate analyzer ( StatStrip Xpress Lactate Meter Lactate Scout + ) . Venous lactate level measure blood gas analyzer serve `` reference method '' . Capillary lactate level analyze handheld lactate analyzer . We aim recruit 240 patient . Outcomes : The primary outcome accuracy capillary blood level measure handheld lactate analyzer compare reference method e.g . venepuncture blood gas analyzer sample . The secondary outcome : ( 1 ) compare difference value venous lactate use blood gas analyzer hand-held lactate analyzer , ( 2 ) compare value capillary venous lactate use hand-held lactate analyzer , ( 3 ) compare report time handheld blood gas analyzer , ( 4 ) Compare value capillary lactate use two hand-held lactate analyzer .</detailed_description>
