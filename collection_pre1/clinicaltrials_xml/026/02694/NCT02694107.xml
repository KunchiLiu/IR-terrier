	<brief_summary>The purpose present study measure effect proprioceptive training , short-term , dynamic postural balance pregnancy 8 week follow-up . Thirty-nine pregnant woman randomize either intervention group ( n=20 ) , would perform proprioceptive exercise , control group ( n=19 , intervention ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Proprioceptive Training Dynamic Postural Balance During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improvement postural balance pregnant woman may improvement joint mechanoreceptor activation present joint capsule , medial ligament , posterior cruciate ligament , meniscus , result improve articular stabilization , consequently , possible increase musculature 's ability provide co-contraction . Improved postural control intervention may due central peripheral nervous system balance control circuit strength gain , show improvement extend second third trimester . The maintenance postural balance require integration visual , vestibular , somatosensory system . At spinal level , first level motor control , nervous reflex movement pattern receive high level nervous system . This provide reflex splint condition abnormal stress joint significant implication rehabilitation.The muscle spindle play major role control muscular movement adjust activity low motor neuron . The second level motor control brain stem , joint afferent relay maintain posture balance body . Information deliver brain stem emanate joint proprioceptor , vestibular center ear , eyes.The final aspect motor control include high level CNS function ( motor cortex , basal ganglion , cerebellum ) mediate cognitive awareness body position movement . Movements repeat stored central command , perform without continuous reference consciousness . This good joint afferent peripheral central nervous system control may reflect improvement balance pregnancy , observe study result proprioceptive training deliver pregnant woman .</detailed_description>
