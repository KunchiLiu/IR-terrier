	<detailed_description>This study involve administration study drug . This study require additional blood draw identify patient respond rituximab anti-CD20 antibody therapy . It expect blood draw occur day IV place dose anti-CD20 antibody bloodwork perform order avoid extra stick . If take part study , additional blood drawn follow time-points surround anti-CD20 antibody therapy : Pre Dose , Cycle 1 - Two 7.5 ml tube ( two teaspoon ) blood take along pre-chemotherapy bloodwork Post Dose , Cycle 1 - Two 5 ml tube ( three teaspoon ) blood take Pre Dose , Cycle 2 - Two 5 ml tube ( two teaspoon ) blood take Post Dose , Cycle 2 - Two 5 ml tube ( two teaspoon ) blood take Pre Dose , Cycle 6 - Two 10 ml tube ( four teaspoon ) blood take Post Dose , Cycle 6 - Two 10 ml tube ( four teaspoon ) blood take Note : Two tube take draw . If blood drawn prior 8 week , 10 ml blood take per tube . For first 4 draw ( cycle 1 cycle 2 , pre- post- ) , amount blood take ensure patient 50 ml blood take within 8 week period .</detailed_description>
