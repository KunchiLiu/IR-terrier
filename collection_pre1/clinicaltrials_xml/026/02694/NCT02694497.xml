	<brief_title>Transmission Genital Extra-genital Chlamydia Trachomatis Infections Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Current national international strategy control Chlamydia trachomatis ( CT ) critically fail obtain reduction transmission . In woman , anorectal infection common genital CT . Yet anorectal CT remain untested sexually transmit infection ( STI ) clinic , general practitioner , hospital population test initiative largely focus genital CT. Part untested anorectal CT incidentally treat treatment apply genital CT , woman anorectal CT often concurrent genital CT . Yet , unknown whether transmission anorectal CT still occur currently recommend treatment . Anorectal genital CT observe quite often regular treatment ( 40 % detection nucleic acid amplification tests-NAAT ) . Proposed reason detection include new ( re- ) infection partner self-infection another anatomic , e.g . anorectal , site . Anorectal infection potential reservoir ongoing transmission genital anorectal CT population , partner anatomic site individual . Yet , neither transmission potential transmission impact anorectal infection report . The scientific evidence optimal control strategy anorectal CT thereby CT totality , lack . Objective : To understand transmission anorectal CT infection woman , i.e . male sexual partner ( ) genital region woman , woman receive routine care , order inform guideline optimize CT control . Study population : Participants recruit 3 large Dutch STI clinic , South Limburg , Amsterdam Rotterdam . Eligible participant likely reflect STI clinic population , term age , ethnicity level education . Participants include genital and/or anorectal CT positive woman ( n=400 ) . Study design : A multicentre prospective cohort study set biological behavioural measurement routine treatment CT. During 3 month , participant study use self-administered anorectal vaginal swab self-collected pre-treatment ( T0 ) , end week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 . Samples test use NAAT presence CT-DNA ( detection ) , concentration ( load ) , viability ( week 4,8 , 12 ) , CT type ( multilocus sequence typing-MLST ) confirm re-infection . To validate sexual exposure , chromosomal Y DNA ( marker semen exposure ) genital anorectal sample apply . At sample time , online self-administered questionnaire behaviour ( e.g . anorectal exposure ) symptom complete . Outcomes : The outcome detection anorectal genital CT time -points . Primary outcome incident detection NAAT , secondary outcome include detection viable CT CT-DNA concentration . Statistical analysis : In statistical analysis , use logistic regression model , impact two key factor assess ( i.e . sexual exposure alternate anatomic site infection ) detection anorectal genital CT . In sub-analyses , role treatment-type evaluate . Expected result : This project provide scientific insight role anorectal CT maintain CT burden , provide practical recommendation ( STI guideline ) reduce avoidable transmission . Implications improve care strategy ( re- ) test partner management currently largely neglect anorectal CT , benefit individual ( well fit care ) public health ( reduce burden ) eventually cost-effectiveness care .</detailed_description>
