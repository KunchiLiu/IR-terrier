	<brief_summary>The study goal improve value care reduce health disparity develop target set sophisticated powerful algorithm improve upon human clinical judgment . The plan use test case detect sepsis patient emergency department ( ED ) first step improve value care reduce health disparity develop target set sophisticated powerful algorithm improve upon human clinical judgment . This work perform use data University Pennsylvania Health System preliminary Early Warning Response System Sepsis monitor clinical parameter . The premise underlie work improve decision-making , reduce low-value care health disparity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study first ingest large volume clinical data ten thousand patient present EDs transfer ICUs general hospital unit , feed data statistical model prediction sepsis . This allow team identify pool patient , base data available doctor time ED visit , highly likely develop sepsis . Researchers analyze physician decision making compare algorithmic decision making , understand extent under- over- diagnosis sepsis , attribute patient doctor lead disparity care . Then researcher develop understand electronic record data could use real time improve physician decision making . An early warning system could help good target intervention sepsis , drive uptake under-treated group , reduce treatment unnecessarily increase cost risks patient . In future , hope work could lay foundation intelligent decision aid leveraging ML , rather current checklist approach decision support . To describe process algorithm development detail , deliverable machine prediction algorithm base claim clinical data support ED physicians make decision sepsis . The design algorithm decision aid address great area need solve prediction problem . Researchers identify ED physician make systematic error judgment thanks bias heuristic tailor decision support adapt ED workflow . This algorithm framework explicitly serve project 's prototype . The approach first derive baseline risk model development sepsis patient meet specific criterion . The scope data include data claim history , outpatient electronic health record ( EHR ) data , risk factor survey data . We develop ML model incorporate additional data stream modality include vital sign , lab value , well image-based data stream telemetry . The fundamental analytical approach take use advanced machine learn technique . The core technique use highly flexible functional form apply randomly partition data , model train one set data validate - test - another set data . Researchers use large set variable prediction : patient demographic , comorbidities , set relevant clinical variable include lab result , medication , order , vitals , socioeconomic descriptor , prior use medical service derive longitudinal source `` 180-day lookback '' ( e.g . data encounter 180 day prior indexed encounter ) . Researchers also use extremely large set individual diagnosis procedure cod raw parameter , rather aggregate comorbidities . Researchers utilize method ( 1 ) maximize ability predict sepsis , improve care outcome ( 2 ) identify cluster patient outcome likelihood improve upon exist risk stratification model . The modeling output include rank weight various factor together group identify sub-groups patient specific clinical characteristic risk stratum .</detailed_description>
