	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine take study drug , conjugate estrogens/bazedoxifene ( Duavee® ) cause change proliferation marker within breast tissue study subject . The study drug approve US Food Drug Administration healthy postmenopausal woman treat certain symptom menopause hot flash . Since approved woman DCIS , use study experimental . This study also look whether take study drug cause significant undesirable side effect woman DCIS . The researcher hope study help determine take study drug safe woman take DCIS possibly reduce risk develop breast cancer woman DCIS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ; I . To assess whether CE/BZA ( conjugate estrogens/bazedoxifene ) 28 day +/- 7 day reduces proliferation measure marker proliferation Ki-67 ( Ki-67 ) protein expression . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether CE/BZA alters marker associate progression invasive cancer ( abrogate response cellular stress [ ARCS ] signature ) postmenopausal woman ductal carcinoma situ [ DCIS ] compare placebo ) . II . To assess change quality life ( QOL ) use Menopause-specific Quality Life ( MENQOL ) questionnaire baseline conclusion intervention woman DCIS treat CE/BZA compare placebo . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess change stromal marker cluster differentiation ( CD ) 36 , woman DCIS CE/BZA compare placebo . II . To assess change hormone receptor ( estrogen receptor alpha [ ERa ] progesterone receptor [ PR ] ) expression woman DCIS treat CE/BZA compare placebo . III . To assess change global gene expression profile ( ribonucleic acid [ RNA ] sequence ) woman DCIS treat CE/BZA compare placebo . IV . To identify possible polymorphism may affect metabolism CE/BZA . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive conjugate estrogens/bazedoxifene orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD day 1-28 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
