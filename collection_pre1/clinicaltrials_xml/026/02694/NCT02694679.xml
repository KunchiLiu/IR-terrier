	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Social Network Targeting Honduras</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Honduras one high neonatal mortality rate Latin America despite make significant stride reduce neonatal , infant , child mortality last several decade . Although many neonatal infant death prevent provision clinical care service , emerge evidence also suggest substantial reduction neonatal infant mortality also achieve simple , low-cost intervention within family community setting . This particularly important area functional community health facility available . Family community outreach program serve educate family beneficial home care practice . In order accelerate neonatal mortality reduction , urgent need develop innovative solution effective , also easily implementable readily scalable . An important component challenge , hitherto effectively measure understood respect neonatal mortality , `` embeddedness '' individual within social network . Hence , large-scale randomize control trial ( RCT ) rural Honduras , deploy ass social network target algorithms order maximize diffusion adoption `` Changing behavior improve neonatal , child , maternal health use communication social network community level intervention ( CBNH ) '' . The CBNH intervention household-level intervention package target health behavior surround neonatal maternal health , diarrhea respiratory illness prevention management implement Inter-American Development Bank ( IADB ) partner . This RCT aim discern optimal method target delivery intervention population . Specifically ( 1 ) test percentage community need program achieve social norm change around key neonatal care behavior , ( 2 ) test whether so-called nominated-friend-targeting , method target individual highly connect network , effective control strategy . Our 2x8 factorial design examine large subset population use `` seed '' group order maximize chance spread effect , efficiency intervention might deliver future . To , assign 176 study village either one two group : 1 ) random assignment ( active comparator ) , `` seed '' individual choose random 2 ) friend-of-random assignment ( experimental ) , `` seed '' individual choose basis name friend randomly select individual . Each group village also assign one eight treatment percentage ( 0 % , 5 % , 10 % , 20 % , 30 % 50 % , 75 % , 100 % ) , represent percent target household village receive CBNH health intervention .</detailed_description>
