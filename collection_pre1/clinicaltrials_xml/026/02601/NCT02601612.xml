	<detailed_description>Human RSV common viral cause serious acute lower respiratory illness ( LRI ) infants child 5 year age worldwide . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity RSV D46cpΔM2-2 vaccine RSV-seropositive child RSV-seronegative infant child . The vaccine evaluate stepwise fashion begin RSV-seropositive child ( Group 1 ) , RSV-seronegative infant child ( Group 2 ) . In group , participant randomly assign receive single dose D46cpΔM2-2 vaccine placebo study entry ( day 0 ) . Participants enrol study April 1 October 31 , outside RSV season .
