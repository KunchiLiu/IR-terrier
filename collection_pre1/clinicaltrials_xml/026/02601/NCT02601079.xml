	<brief_summary>Endodrill new instrument biopsy sample GI-channel . The purpose study follow : - Compare Endodrill instrument conventional biopsy forceps term ability establish correct diagnosis base collected biopsy tumor upper GI tract . - Based quality collect tissue sample want evaluate instrument generates useful material genetic study tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endodrill v . Conventional Biopsy . Diagnostics Genetic Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endodrill newly construct biopsy tool flexible endoscopic use . It use drill motion within case harvest solid biopsy tissue biopsy channel conventional flexible endoscope . It originally design sample tissue submucosal lesion . The investigators´ first study instrument finish . Endodrill safe use generates submucosal tissue compare biopsy conventional biopsy forceps . In study investigator want compare Endodrill instrument´s ability obtain representative tissue sample tumor distal esophagus cardia conventional biopsy forceps . In addition investigator want compare tissue sample term weight , quality , artefacts whether either instrument suit collect tissue genetic analysis . Such analysis conduct Next-Generation Sequensing ( NGS ) whole exome , Whole Exome Sequensing ( WES ) . In event positive result analysis investigator also conduct RNA-sequencing tumor tissue order start pre-operative mapping genetic abnormality . 20 patient enrol study . For patient investigator collect 10 biopsy , 5 biopsy conventional biopsy Endodrill instrument respectively . The order randomize patient . For specific biopsy investigator choose particular site suspect tumor tissue without know instrument use biopsy . This procedure repeat 10 biopsy .</detailed_description>
