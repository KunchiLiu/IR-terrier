	<brief_summary>Current drug-eluting stent ( DES ) demonstrate excellent clinical outcome patient coronary artery disease . However , continue risk clinical event even several year procedure report . Stent platform polymer-associated inflammation may play role . Bioresorbable scaffold ( BRS ) know disappear 2 3 year implantation , may result favorable long-term clinical outcome compare metallic stent . The initial clinical experience BRS relatively simple lesion subset comparable DESs . BRS , however , limit disadvantageous mechanical characteristic thick strut risk fracture overdilation . There concern BRS le optimal complex lesion subset bifurcation lesion , calcify tortuous lesion , diffuse long lesion . Real world registry need test feasibility safety BRS complex lesion subset .</brief_summary>
