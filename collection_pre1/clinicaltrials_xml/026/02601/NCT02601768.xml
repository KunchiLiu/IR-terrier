	<brief_summary>The aim study determine whether three-dimensional tranesophageal echocardiography ( 3D TEE ) assessment ostium secundum atrial septal defect ( ASD II ) may efficient two-dimensional ( 2D ) TEE assessment complement balloon-sizing transcatheter closure defect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Occluder Size Determination Transcatheter ASD II Closure Based 3D TEE Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 50 consecutive patient eligible percutaneous ASD II closure enrol study . 3D-TEE perform diagnostic process ; image record investigation , however , measurments defect take procedure . Traditional 2D-TEE together balloon-sizing assessment defect perform enrolled patient order chose device . Control transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) provide twice evaluate outcome transcatheter treatment : 1 day procedure 6-12 month later . The previously obtain 3D image retrospectively assess 2 independent investigator exclude interventionalists ' team . Maximum minimum diameter , perimeter area defect measure propose assume optimal occluder size . Correlation propose occluder size device use procedure statistically analyze .</detailed_description>
