	<brief_summary>This Phase I , open-label , dose escalation dose expansion study BID oral dose tazemetostat . Subjects screen eligibility within 14 day plan first dose tazemetostat . A treatment cycle 28 day . Response assessment evaluate 8 week treatment subsequently every 8 week study . The study two part : Dose Escalation Dose Expansion . Dose escalation subject follow relapsed/refractory malignancy : - Rhabdoid tumor : - Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor ( ATRT ) - Malignant rhabdoid tumor ( MRT ) - Rhabdoid tumor kidney ( RTK ) - Selected tumor rhabdoid feature - INI1-negative tumor : - Epithelioid sarcoma - Epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor - Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma - Myoepithelial carcinoma - Renal medullary carcinoma - Other INI1-negative malignant tumor ( e.g. , dedifferentiate chordoma ) ( Sponsor approval ) - Synovial Sarcoma SS18-SSX rearrangement Dose Expansion MTD RP2D , subject rhabdoid tumor ( MRT/ATRT/RTK/selected tumor rhabdoid feature ) .</brief_summary>
