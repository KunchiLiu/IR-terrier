	<brief_summary>This phase 2 , open-label , multicenter study explore efficacy safety oral GED- 0301 subject active UC , define modify Mayo score ( MMS ) ≥ 4 ≤ 9 Mayo endoscopic subscore≥ 2 . Approximately 40 subject enrol use Interactive Voice Response System ( IVRS ) Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ) receive open-label , oral GED-0301 160 mg duration 52 week treatment .

	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Mongersen ( GED-0301 ) Subjects With Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subject Baseline Visit ( Week 0/ Visit 2 ) receive follow treatment : - Induction Phase - GED-0301 160 mg daily ( QD ) 8 week ; - Extension Phase - GED-0301 160 mg alternate dose schedule ( GED-0301 160 mg QD 4 week , follow 4 week without GED-0301 treatment ) additional 44 week . Subjects achieve least 20 % decrease partial mayo score ( PMS ) baseline Week 12 discontinue study . Clinical , safety , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data evaluate ongoing basis , however , response treatment lower expect ( eg , ≤2 subject achieve clinical remission base modify Mayo score ( MMS ) ) 50 % subject complete Week 8 , discontinue Week 8 , study team review available data ( clinical , safety , PK ) evaluate study conduct modify . This evaluation base clinical judgment follow guidance - Consider start new cohort subject use QD dose 320 mg endoscopic histologic evidence proximal colon benefit limit distal colon drug exposure/efficacy . Also , evidence potential overall efficacy ( total Mayo score ( TMS ) , MMS , PMS ) outcomes acceptable safety ( adverse event ( AEs ) /vitals/clinical laboratory test result ) exposure ( PK ) . - Consider terminate study evidence drug exposure/efficacy colon observe endoscopy biopsy evidence potential overall efficacy ( TMS , MMS , PMS ) outcomes unacceptable safety ( AEs/labs/vitals ) exposure ( PK ) . - Continue study GED-0301 160 mg QD dose . If GED-0301 160 mg QD dose group discontinue new dose group add , additional 40 subject enrol new dose group . Subjects enrolled subsequent decision adjust dose GED-0301 , receive follow treatment : - Induction Phase - GED-0301 , 320 mg QD , 8 week ; - Extension Phase- GED-0301 , 320 mg alternate dose schedule ( GED-0301 , 320 mg QD 4 week , follow 4 week without GED-0301 treatment ) additional 44 week . Subjects achieve least 20 % decrease PMS baseline Week 12 discontinue study . Actively enrolled subject affect dose adjustment . Subjects receive corticosteroid baseline start taper corticosteroid Week 8 ( end Induction Phase ) achieve clinical response , define decrease baseline least 2 point least 25 % , along reduction RBS least 1 point absolute RBS ≤ 1 MMS . The endoscopy subscore assess investigator use calculation Week 8 MMS . The study consist 4 phase : - Screening Phase - 4 week - Induction Phase - 8 week - Extension Phase - 44 week - Observational Follow-up Phase - 4 week Subjects complete Extension Phase , subject prematurely discontinue study reason , enter post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase , 4-week period last dose Investigational Product ( IP ) . The study conduct compliance International Conference Harmonisation ( ICH ) Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs ) .</detailed_description>
