	<brief_title>Inhaled GM-CSF Respiratory Virus-Associated Severe Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory failure respiratory virus include influenza A virus respiratory syncytial virus common cause pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) admission requirement initiation mechanical ventilation . In subset subject difficult identify base patient characteristic , worsen lung disease , pneumonia , develop subject progress pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome ( PARDS ) . This result prolong PICU stay , significant morbidity , case , mortality . The overarch goal project improve outcome patient PARDS secondary respiratory virus infection . Research suggest granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) , cytokine produce many cell type body , add significance lung may important factor resolution lung inflammation , may suppress respiratory virus . This GM-CSF-deficient environment may important trigger lung dysfunction ; therefore , replenishment lung exogenous GM-CSF potential extremely beneficial . In phase I dose escalation clinical study propose investigate safety efficacy administration inhale GM-CSF ( iGM-CSF ) child respiratory virus-associated PARDS .</detailed_description>
