	<brief_summary>This first study effect variable frequency stimulation ( VFS ) Freezing gait ( FOG ) Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient STN DBS . FOG respond poorly High frequency stimulation ( HFS ) alleviate relatively VFS . This study would significant clinical implication management Freezing gait ( FOG ) PD patient subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) DBS . The investigator hypothesize VFS could better effect FOG HFS low frequency stimulation ( LFS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HFS STN provide consistent , long-term improvement cardinal motor sign PD , bradykinesia , tremor rigidity . FOG respond poorly HFS tend continue deteriorate time , alleviate relatively LFS . Evidence indicate LFS-STN improve axial sign PD patient , experienced loss efficacy short term . Then come little improvement even bad tremor , rigidity bradykinesia , consist three main symptom Parkinson 's disease . Thus even axial problem could solve LFS long way , could also hard tolerate patient . The effect VFS FOG study . The investigator hypothesize VFS could better effect Freezing gait HFS LFS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients receive bilateral STN stimulation six month . 2 . They optimize conventional HFS control tremor , rigidity bradykinesia yet complain freeze gait . 3 . Subjects ability walk least 10 meter independently ON DBS condition . Exclusion criterion : 1. gait disorder perceive patient direct consequence STN stimulation primary disease . 2. change HFS DBS setting , three month prior participation study . 3. complete inability walk despite assistance DBS ON . 4 . Subjects respond reprogramming chronic DBS setting ( report improvement freeze ) . 5 . Subjects could tolerate prolong OFF medication condition .</criteria>
