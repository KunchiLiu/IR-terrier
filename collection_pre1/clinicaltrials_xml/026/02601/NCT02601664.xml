	<brief_summary>Design : Single center , single-blind randomize controlled trial patient high risk native coronary artery lesion ( define ≥2 contiguous yellow block block chemogram ) require clinically indicate percutaneous coronary intervention . Patients randomize either combine intervention conventional PCI . Cardiac biomarker measurement perform PCI 18-24 hour later . Treatment : Combined intervention consist pre-PCI intracoronary vasodilator glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration , use EPD technically feasible , complete coverage lipid core plaque , technically feasible . Control : Conventional PCI . Duration : 30 day follow-up . The primary trial objective compare incidence size periprocedural MI , assess peak post-PCI troponin distribution two study group . The secondary endpoint : ( 1 ) Reduction incidence &gt; 3x &gt; 10x upper limit normal increase CK-MB . ( 2 ) Reduction incidence slow flow/no-reflow post PCI . ( 3 ) Lower incidence major adverse cardiac event , define composite death , acute coronary syndrome , coronary revascularization ) 30-day follow-up .</brief_summary>
