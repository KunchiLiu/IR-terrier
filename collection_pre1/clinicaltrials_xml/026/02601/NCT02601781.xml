	<brief_title>Use BVS ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) : BVS STEMI STRATEGY-IT Prospective Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Population : This registry intend obtain data consecutive STEMI patient undergo PPCI BVS implantation 10-15 Italian site . STEMI define accord European guideline criterion . Procedure : Dual Anti-Platelet Antithrombotic Regimen : Patients undergo PPCI receive combination aspirin ( i.v . o ) load dose oral P2Y12 receptor blocker ( ticagrelor , prasugrel clopidogrel prasugrel ticagrelor available contraindicate ) early possible angiography parenteral anticoagulant accord current guideline . In particular early administration ( least outside cath-lab first medical contact/ambulance case ticagrelor ) P2Y12 receptor blocker load dose ( ticagrelor 180 mg , prasugrel 60 mg clopidogrel 600 mg prasugrel ticagrelor available contraindicate ) could paramount importance BVS implant thrombotic setting reduce risk device thrombosis . For reason , case angiographic evidence large thrombus use glycoprotein consider accord current guideline . The P2Y12 inhibitor recommend ( ticagrelor 90 mg bid , prasugrel 10 mg clopidogrel 75 mg ) addition acetyl salicylic acid maintain least 12 month BVS implantation ( decision longer term use leave discretion treat physician accord specific clinical scenario ) . Anticoagulation recommend patient addition anti-platelet therapy PPCI accord current guideline . Access Site : Even specific arterial site access mandatory , radial approach prefer method access . Guiding Catheter Guide-wires : The guide catheter guide-wires choose ( accord Institution preference ) obtain maximum stability system facilitate BVS delivery culprit site . The use 6 Fr guide catheter recommend even BVS ( 2.5 3.0 ) also implant via 5 Fr guide catheter . BVS Size Selection BVS size actually available limited ( diameter : 2.5 mm , 3.0 mm , 3.5 mm length : 8 , 12 mm , 18 mm , 23 mm 28 mm ) . In order reduce vasoconstriction typical STEMI set accurately select BVS diameter fundamental obtain maximum vessel dilatation administration intracoronary bolus vasodilator drug ( i.e . nitroglycerin adenosine ) TIMI flow ( &gt; 0 ) restoration . Once maximal dilatation obtain ( vasodilator drug strongly recommend ) , BVS size selection make accordingly maximal vessel diameter ( visually estimate operator ) assess immediately proximal distal culprit lesion site ( 2 orthogonal angiographic view ) . This step paramount importance consider maximal post-expansion BVS limit ( +0.5 mm vs. nominal BVS diameter ) compare new generation DES ( 1.0 mm vs. nominal DES diameter ) . For reason slight BVS diameter overestimation compare visually estimate reference vessel size suggest ( i.e . BVS 3.5 mm reference vessel diameter [ RVD ] &gt; 3.0 mm , BVS 3.0 mm RVD &gt; 2.5 mm ) . As compare visual estimation , quantitative coronary angiography ( QCA ) provide objective information even also tend underestimate lumen diameter . Intracoronary image system intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) may help overcome aforementioned limitation may consider important tool scaffold size selection . Even intravascular imaging use routinely require study perform operator 's discretion . Pre-dilatation : Lesion preparation deployment essential step patient receive BVS , goal lesion preparation facilitate scaffold delivery , reduce plaque shift , , importantly , allow optimal scaffold expansion . BVS Implantation : Prior use , everolimus-eluting BVS system inspect prepared accord Instruction Use ( IFU ) . The BVS cover 2-5 mm healthy vessel either edge culprit lesion . BVS deployment must perform gradually , inflate delivery system 's balloon 2 atm increment ( rat burst pressure ) every five second complete expansion BVS . Once reach , target pressure maintain ( tolerated patient ) least 30 second favour device expansion . Multiple BVS overlap allow case long lesion involve culprit site . However thick BVS strut mandate minimize overlapping length particularly STEMI set . If overlap require start distal scaffold prefer except case proximal landmark ( i.e . long lesion involve ostial segment vessel ) must respect . Among different BVS overlap strategy proposed19 , marker-to-marker ( second proximal BVS advance distal balloon marker line proximal marker bead implant scaffold obtain 1 mm strut overlap ) technique suggest study . Use angiographic `` stent enhancement '' tool two orthogonal projection help marker-to-market positioning . A `` hybrid '' BVS-DES overlapping allow . In case culprit lesion involve bifurcation site , single-BVS approach ( wire positioning side branch [ `` keep open '' ] ) nothing else suggest . In case flow-limiting thrombus shift main side-branch ( SB ) , consider BVS fenestration toward SB semi-compliant balloon ( 2.0-3.0 mm diameter accord SB dimension ) . If second device require bail-out strategy ( i.e . persistent flow limitation balloon dilatation SB ) , metallic stent implantation consider . In case bifurcate culprit lesion 2-stent strategy plan intention-to-treat advisable avoid BVS implantation . In case extensive CAD vessel remote ( multi-vessel CAD ) infarct-related artery , culprit lesion systematically treat initial intervention . Immediate ( preventive ) intervention non-infarct-related lesion recommend . In case , stag PCI perform within 50 day PPCI BVS implantation suggest order complete revascularization accord lesion characteristic . Post-dilatation : BVS deployment STEMI set aim : 1 ) obtain full BVS expansion le 20 % residual stenosis culprit site ; 2 ) reduce distal embolization ( slow-flow/no-reflow phenomenon ) take advantage BVS strut thickness ( call `` snow-racket concept '' ) . Even post-dilatation routinely perform PPCI new generation intracoronary prosthesis ( 15-20 % case ) , may require ( encourage study ) BVS implantation STEMI patient . In particular inflation non-compliant balloon ( 10-60 second tolerated patient ) maximum diameter 0.5 mm BVS diameter suggest case TIMI 3 flow 20 % residual stenosis ( angiographic visual estimation ) . In case TIMI 3 flow less 20 % residual stenosis decision post-dilate ( NC balloon nominal diameter BVS implant ) leave operator 's discretion . Post-dilatation could avoid case : 1 ) residual stenosis associate adequate BVS expansion apposition ( preferably confirm intravascular image system -IVUS OCT- ) ; 2 ) transient slow-flow no-reflow BVS implantation subsequent TIMI flow 3 restoration . Follow-up : Clinical data collect medical staff participate center hospital visit telephone contact 30 day , 6 month , 1 year , 3-and 5-years PPCI . Angiographic follow-up mandatory perform case plan `` step '' revascularisation clinically indicate follow-up . However , patient undergo angiographic follow-up ( IVUS OCT follow-up ) include subgroup analysis . Data Collection : Clinical , lesion , procedural data follow-up outcomes patient give write informed consent enter web-based Case Report Form ( CRF ) . The monitoring study data entry continuously supervise Steering Committee order respect enrollment plan . Enrolment : The enrolment period limit 12 month since first patient enrol specific participate center . However could extend recruit proceeds slowly . Informed Consent Withdrawal criterion : All patient must sign write informed consent enrol registry . The patient right withdraw registry time without reason . Upon early withdrawal registry , case report form ( CRF ) complete far possible reason withdrawal possible document . Statistical Methods : Numerical data present mean Â± standard deviation minimum maximum value . Categorical data present count percentage total . Cross tabulation subgroup summary statistic calculate necessary . Two-sided 95 % confidence interval give adequate . All data present use descriptive statistical method . For metric data set , mean value , standard deviation , median , maximum minimum well 95 % confidence interval state . For categorical data , absolute relative frequency determine , exact 95 % confidence interval calculate . Furthermore , primary secondary end-points , Kaplan Meier curve present event-free survival analysis perform compare subgroup . Sample Size Justification : The paper Brugaletta et al . ( BVS-EXAMINATION ) report incidence DOCE 3.1 % 30 day : give potential important impact pre-specified implantation strategy STEMI patient undergo BVS implantation , aim appraise reduction 0.7 % , 505 patient require 80 % chance detecting , significant 5 % level , decrease primary outcome 2.4 % . ( Pocock SJ . Clinical Trials : A Practical Approach . Wiley ; 1983 ) The paper Brugaletta et al . ( BVS-EXAMINATION ) report incidence DOCE 3.1 % 30 day ( 9/290 ) . Accordingly , Investigators compute target sample 500 patient enable computation reasonably precise 95 % confidence interval . Specifically , assume rate 3.1 % DOCE 30 day , confidence interval compute Welson score would 2 % 5.1 % ( 16/500 ) . Confidentiality : The investigator shall maintain patient confidentiality audit inspection clinical site documentation . Registry patient identify unique patient number , use correspondence registry database . The Investigator keep list patient name along assigned patient number .</detailed_description>
