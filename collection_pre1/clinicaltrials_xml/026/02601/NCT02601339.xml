	<detailed_description>A . Introduction specific aim : Twelve percent live birth United States premature , result need care 500,000 premature infant ( 1,2 ) . Germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage ( GM-IVH ) major complication prematurity , occur 45 % extremely low birth weight infant ( weight &lt; 1000 g ) ( 3-5 ) , grade associate adverse long-term neurological impairment ( 6,7 ) . Even improve neonatal intensive care technological advance increase survival rate extremely premature infant , high incidence GM-IVH remain unchanged past decade ( 8,9 ) . Premature infant born immature capacity cerebral hemodynamic regulation , put highly vascularize germinal matrix ( GM ) region risk hemorrhage ( 10,11 ) . The special vascular morphology GM function supply significant metabolic demand wave cell proliferation migration GM cortex prior term gestational age ( 12,13 ) . GM-IVH-induced suppression wave cell proliferation believe responsible later failure cerebrum grow normal volume subsequent delay neurodevelopmental outcome ( 14 ) . A bedside tool measure CMRO2 may benefit monitor evolution GM-IVH , response therapy , predict future neurodevelopmental impairment ( NDI ) . In study , use advanced near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) technology develop MGH monitor cerebral oxygen metabolism ( CMRO2 ) newborns bedside . We hypothesize baseline metabolic dysfunction cerebral blood flow potential biomarkers germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus severity response PHH treatment . To test hypothesis , address follow specific aim : 1 . Determine post-natal cerebral hemodynamics oxygen metabolism trajectory GM-IVH PHH neonates respect normal control difference PHH infant infant affected hydrocephalus due pathology . To address Aim : 1 . Perform NIRS measurement several week 4 group infant : GM-IVH group , PHH group , age-matched premature infant without evidence brain injury ( healthy control group ( HC ) ) , infant ventriculomegaly ( ventriculomegaly control group ( VC ) ) . 2 . Compare NIRS result early postnatal period infant different severity GM-IVH PHH healthy control ( HC ) . 3 . Compare NIRS result infant develop hydrocephalus consequence intraventricular hemorrhage ( PHH ) infants VC control group . 4 . Correlate NIRS result grade GM-IVH well resolution complication determine ultrasound and/or MRI . 5 . Correlate NIRS result severity hydrocephalus determine ultrasound and/or MRI . We hypothesize 1 ) Infants GM-IVH low CBF CMRO2 healthy control decrease proportion severity GM-IVH . ( GM-IVH v HC ) 2 ) Infants PHH low CBF CMRO2 healthy control . ( PHH v HC ) 3 ) For infant develop PHH , decrease CBF CMRO2 affect hemorrhage severity hydrocephalus . ( PHH v VC ) 2 . Test efficacy cerebral hemodynamics metabolism detect hydrocephalus treatment response PHH VC group . To address Aim two group , : 1 . Perform additional pre- post-intervention measurement treatment . 2 . Determine change cerebral perfusion metabolism response intervention . 3 . Correlate NIRS result independent evaluation treatment response determine clinical assessment well ultrasound and/or MRI . 4 . Compare treatment response PHH VC group . We hypothesize CBF CMRO2 increase response treatment-associated improvement hydrocephalus remain depressed response treatment inadequate . B . Procedures : The subject population include neonate without IVH le 3 month old correct age first measure . We plan perform measurement 90 neonate enrol Brigham Women 's Hospital 80 neonate Boston Children 's Hospital course study . Patient enrollment- For patient recruitment , one study member identify potential subject . Once potential subject identify , study member contact attend physician bedside nurse oversee care potential subject receive permission consenting . The parent potential subject receive permission contact study investigator . In addition medical co-investigators , non-MD study member specifically educate trained NIRS technology , goal study , extensive training informed consent process , intricacy Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) environment , delicate nature NICU qualify recruiting . Participation study completely voluntary may terminate parent time . Any measurement result study restrict research investigation affect health care provide hospital . Measurements- Near infrared spectroscopy : Frequency domain NIRS ( FDNIRS ) quantify hemoglobin concentration oxygenation ( SO2 ) deep tissue measure absorption scatter coefficient examine tissue multiple wavelength red near-infrared spectral region ( 15-17 ) . Diffuse correlation spectroscopy ( DCS ) measure microvascular blood flow deep tissue quantify temporal intensity fluctuation scatter light arise Doppler shift induce move red blood cell ( 5,18,19 ) . By combine two technology ( FDNIRS-DCS ) , index cerebral metabolic rate oxygen ( CMRO2i ) estimate ( 6,13 ) . The light from/to NIRS device deliver to/from head subject fiber optic cable arrange within optical probe . A rigid probe use maintain fixed source-detector separation , need accurate quantification hemoglobin concentration blood flow . All light exposure skin within American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ) Standards approve light level . The laser light collimate , rather expanded/diffused probe end . This result Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance ( NOHD ) 5-7 cm , low 10 cm focus distance retina . Hence , eye protection require DCS device connect probe . The FDNIRS DCS device combine system maintain MGH investigator Optics Division Martinos center Biomedical Imaging use site location approve protocol . MGH , BWH BCH Biomedical Engineering test device annually regularly . Measurement procedure ( 20 ) - Measurements do flexible time frame preferably subject sleeping . NIRS measurement do 7 location include bilateral frontal , parietal temporal region repeat 5 time , total time bedside longer 30 minute . All infant enrol study measure day duration hospital stay clinically feasible . If subject PHH VC group schedule surgery treatment treat progressive hydrocephalus , perform additional short measurement monitor response treatment . These short measurement session exceed 30 minute four time 24 hour immediately treatment . . In day follow intervention interest ( initial 24-hour post-operative post-treatment window ) , measurement schedule return regular basis . Subjects VC PHH group clinical follow-up visit ( independent study ) monitor treatment evolution condition . We attempt schedule follow-up FDNIRS-DCS measurement day study subject return hospital clinical imaging consults . C. Adverse Event Criteria Reporting Procedures : Adverse event deem related participation study document report IRB promptly ( within 7 calendar day ) . Unrelated adverse event , include untoward medical occurrence may present conduct measurement without casual relationship study procedure , occur presence also document report IRB time continue review . Physician investigators/the PI determine relatedness base upon event , timing , plausibility , medical problem and/or possible explanation event . Serious adverse event ( SAE ) result death , life-threatening experience , inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization , persistent significant disability/incapacity congenital anomaly/birth defect , require medical surgical intervention prevent outcomes . To ensure SAEs complication potentially relate study procedure promptly identify , PIs educate study coordinator hospital-specific SAEs instruct report potential SAE complication immediately ( day either identify ) . F. Data Management Methods The study 's Data Safety Monitoring Plan Standard Operating Procedures develop address issue safety , recruitment enrollment , data collection management , quality control . Highlights relate data management . Subjects ' privacy confidentiality protect time accordance Partners Human Research Committee ( PHRC ) Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) standard requirement . Highlights relate data management . Subjects ' privacy confidentiality protect time . When infant enrol , parent sign consent form infant assign study identification ( ID ) number , include name , initial , potential identifier . The Study ID Tracking Log , list medical record number correspond subject identification code , store electronically separate secure file . Only study staff list protocol access site . A second secure electronic database use store infant ' clinical information ( diagnostic test , image , etc . ) well measurement information ( birth date , date measurement , measurement location , instrument use , bedside note , etc. ) .
