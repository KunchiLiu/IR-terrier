	<brief_title>IVF Outcome Following Treatment With Ulipristal Acetate Myomatous Uterus After Least One IVF Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulipristal Acetate - Study design Introduction : Leiomyomas well establish factor affect fertility . The key factor fertility disturbance fibroid location size . The presence submucosal fibroid long know reduce fertility oppose subserosal fibroid alter fertility . The effect intramural fibroid fertility still mystery . These finding best describe meta-analysis 23 study : - With respect location , woman fibroid low chance ongoing pregnancy live birth ( RR 0.7 , 95 % CI 0.59-0.83 ) great chance spontaneous abortion ( RR 1.68 , 95 % CI 1.37-2.05 ) . - Women fibroid submucosal intramural intracavitary component less likely become pregnant ( RR 0.36 , 95 % CI 0.18-0.74 ) likely spontaneous abortion ( RR 1.7 , 95 % CI 1.4-2.1 ) . - The picture le clear woman intramural fibroid . Overall , study woman fibroid distort uterine cavity less likely become pregnant ( RR 0.81 , 95 % CI 0.70-0.94 ) , less likely ongoing pregnancy deliver live newborn ( RR 0.7 , 95 % CI 0.58-0.85 ) likely spontaneous abortion ( RR 1.7 , 95 % CI 1.2-2.5 ) . - In addition finding , woman cavity-distorting fibroid undergone myomectomy significant increase conception rate ( RR 2.03 , 95 % CI 1.08-3.83 ) . - There significant difference woman myomectomy intramural fibroid go surgical treatment , although data issue quite lame . Another strong evidence relevance intramural fibroid fertility find meta-analysis evaluate association non-cavity-distorting intramural fibroid IVF outcome , study show significant decrease live birth ( RR 0.79 , 95 % CI 0.70 -0.88 ) clinical pregnancy rate ( RR 0.85 , 95 % CI 0.77 - 0.94 ) woman non-cavity-distorting intramural fibroid compare without fibroid , follow IVF treatment . Ulipristal : Ulipristal acetate ( UPA ) selective progesterone receptor modulator ( SPRM ) prescribe woman symptomatic leiomyoma . Few phase 3 study conduct order prove clinical use efficacy treat woman suffer fibroid . - PEARL ( PGL4001 Efficacy Assessment Reduction Symptoms Due Uterine Leiomyomas ) I randomize , double-blind , placebo control trial ( 48 patient placebo arm , 95 treat daily dosage 5 mg &amp; 94 10 mg UPA ) prove treatment UPA 5 mg 10 mg daily 13 week course efficient control uterine bleeding ( 91 % &amp; 92 % respectively ) comparison placebo ( 19 % ) , P &lt; 0.001 dose . The rate amenorrhea 73 % , 82 % 6 % respectively . The median change total fibroid volume -22 % , -12 % &amp; +3 % ( p=0.002 5 mg group &amp; 0.006 10 mg group comparison placebo group ) . - PEARL II double blind non-inferiority trial compare UPA ( 5 mg 10 mg daily ) treatment 3 month once-monthly IM Leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg ( 97 patient 5 mg arm , 103 10 mg arm &amp; 101 treated Leuprolide acetate ) . The rate uterine bleed comparable three group - 90 % , 98 % , 89 % . Median time amenorrhea 7 day , 5 day , 21 day - respectively . Adverse effect matter moderate severe hot flash much common woman treat Leuprolide acetate - 40 % comparison treat UPA ( 11 % 5 mg group &amp; 10 % 10 mg group , p &lt; 0.001 group ) . In November 2014 Luyckx et al . publish retrospective analysis series 52 patient one medical center ( participant PEARL II PEARL III ) - patient , 21 wish conceive upon treatment completion - 15 ( 71 % ) succeed total 18 pregnancy . - Median time conceive 10 month completion therapy . - Two woman need myomectomy completion UPA treatment achieve 3 pregnancy . - 15 pregnancy myomectomy ( 8 laparoscopy , 7 laparotomy ) . - 6 pregnancy ( 6 18 , 33 % ) result early miss abortion 12 pregnancy end live birth 13 baby . The relative high ratio miscarriage relate age woman ( median 36.4 year ) high proportion IVF ( 3/6 miscarriage ) . - Only one deliveries vaginal delivery , 7 elective cesarean delivery 4 emergent cesarean section . - There significant fibroid regrowth pregnancy . - There one fetal anomaly cohort - patient treat new UPA course already pregnant ( unexpectedly ) - fetus show ectopic right kidney inferior pole leave kidney . A review pregnancies exposure mifepristone induce abortion UPA give emergency contraception show additional risk congenital anomaly . Selective progesterone receptor modulators UPA well know induce endometrial modification know PAEC ( Progesterone receptor modulators Associated Endometrial Changes ) - change benign , non-proliferative &amp; non-physiological . This histological pattern apparent large proportion woman 13 week UPA treatment course ( PEARL I - 74.2 % patient 5 mg group &amp; 70.4 % 10 mg group ; PEARL II 65.1 % 5 mg group &amp; 69.8 % among treated 10 mg UPA ) . Endometrial biopsy take six month treatment cessation show return normal histological endometrial appearance . In RCT 's endometrial biopsy examination take week 13 show benign change except : ( ) one patient 5 mg UPA treatment whose specimen show simple hyperplasia ( b ) one patient placebo group complex atypical hyperplasia . Hypothesis : After review relevant medical data investigator assume treat woman intramural fibroid distort uterine cavity mostly intramural less 50 % submucosal component UPA 13 week course would reduce fibroid size improve chance conceive IVF treatment . Materials &amp; Methods : Study design : A proof concept prospective randomize study . The patient : About 20 woman treat fertility IVF unit least one IVF failure , mostly intramural fibroid [ class 2-5 FIGO classification system ] size &gt; 4 cm confirm TVUS diagnostic hysteroscopy . After US examination diagnostic hysteroscopy ascertain suitability study , offer course 13 week treatment UPA 5 mg per day . One month cessation treatment investigator perform another TVUS examination &amp; diagnostic hysteroscopy plus endometrial biopsy order ass endometrial &amp; uterine status conduct additional IVF cycle , use stimulation protocol undertaken immediate cycle previous UPA treatment course . The data : Demographic data - Age , BMI . Obstetrical data - Gravida , para . Gynecological data - Hormonal profile , uterus size , fibroid feature ( location , size ) , infertility feature ( duration , cause ) , past stimulation IVF treatment variable .</detailed_description>
