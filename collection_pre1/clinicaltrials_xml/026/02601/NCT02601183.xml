	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause morbidity disability among aged population around world , incidence still rise recently . The cerebrovascular disease approximately divide two type , namely ischemic hemorrhagic stroke . Their pathophysiological process therapeutical strategy totally different . For hemorrhagic stroke , take 20 % patient cerebrovascular disease , lack valid medical management early stage except surgical hematoma removal . Whereas 's key management ischemic stroke recanalize occlude artery restore blood flow irreversible brain damage . According Guidelines Prevention Stroke Patients Stroke Transient Ischemic Attack , intravenous thrombolysis within 3-4.5 hour highly recommend acute ischemic stroke patient . The time window thrombolysis ischemic stroke extremely narrow greatly affected patient ' outcome . Despite efficacious therapy exists , rate successful early thrombolysis still awfully low , especially develop country . Only 3-5 % stroke patient take advantage early thrombolysis . There two major reason response low successful thrombolysis rate , include civilian first-aid personnel n't master timing thrombolysis therapy ischemic stroke . That would improve propaganda education stroke knowledge . But 's critical difficulty diagnose ischemic stroke hemorrhagic stroke early symptom sign . It 's high risk enlarge hematoma patient hemorrhagic stroke receive thrombolytic drug . For reason , 's hard doctor provide correct treatment first time image examination finish . And time cost CT MRI examination likely responsible miss narrow time window poor prognosis stroke patient . Consequently , seek noninvasive , rapid , portable inexpensive diagnosis method sensitively distinguish stroke type CT MRI examination would helpful treat ischemic stroke patient . The new method would enable first-aid personnel judge stroke type ambulance decide apply intravenous thrombolysis . Because blockage cerebral supply artery , especially cerebral middle artery ca n't compensate , blood flow corresponding hemisphere would drop sharply among ischemic stroke patient . Along decrease heat circulatory system , infract hemisphere 's temperature drop . The reduced brain temperature influenced temperature ipsilateral forehead accord data animal preliminary clinical trial . In contrast , temperature ipsilateral hemisphere show mild increase among ischemic stroke patient preliminary experiment . That 's possibly early mitochondrial dysfunction inflammatory reaction induce hematoma . The difference temperature tendency ipsilateral forehead great chance early physical mark . Temperature test could rapid noninvasive , make mark promising method help doctor distinguish stroke type early stage . Earlier diagnosis ischemic stroke mean early thrombolysis much good prognosis . In study , 30 ischemic stroke patient 30 hemorrhagic stroke patient recruit . In process recruitment , patient acute stroke attack 4.5 hour collect temperature five point without head coverage , include ipsilateral tempora , ipsilateral forehead , galbella , contralateral forehead , contralateral tempora . Then stroke would recruit ischemic hemorrhagic group accord later CT MRI result hospital . The accuracy sensibility early brain temperature distinguish stroke type would test comparison diagnosis image examination . It emphasize diagnosis follow treatment depend image examination brain temperature test rapid noninvasive . The therapy recruit stroke patient would n't influence trial usual standard therapy .</detailed_description>
