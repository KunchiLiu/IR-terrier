Screening subject determine eligibility study perform within 21 day first plan dose tazemetostat . Eligible subject enrol one fivecohorts base tumor type : - Cohort 1 : MRT , RTK , ATRT , select tumor rhabdoid feature , include small cell carcinoma ovary hypercalcemic type [ SCCOHT ] , also know malignant rhaboid tumor ovary [ MRTO ] - Cohort 2 : Relapsed refractory synovial sarcoma SS18-SSX rearrangement - Cohort 3 : Other INI1 negative tumor solid tumor EZH2 gain function ( GOF ) mutation , include : epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( EMPNST ) , extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma ( EMC ) , myoepithelial carcinoma , INI1-negative malignant tumor Sponsor approval ( e.g. , dedifferentiated chordoma ) solid tumor EZH2 GOF mutation include limit Ewing 's sarcoma melanoma - Cohort 4 : Renal medullary carcinoma ( RMC ) - Cohort 5 : Epithelioid sarcoma ( ES ) Treatment tazemetostat continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent , termination study . Response assessment evaluate 8 week treatment every 8 week thereafter study .</brief_summary>
