	<brief_summary>A multicentre multinational prospective management outcome study recently prove safety diagnostic strategy combine clinical probability assessment age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off , define value ( age x 10 ) patient &gt; 50 year , rule PE outpatient , low likelihood subsequent symptomatic VTE . Moreover , study show strategy increase diagnostic yield D-dimers , allow rule PE without investigation significantly high proportion patient use standard cut-off , particularly patient 75 year old .

	<brief_title>Age-adjusted D-dimer Cut-off Rule Out Pulmonary Embolism Emergency Department : A Real Life Impact Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND PE diagnostic strategy Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) frequently suspect diagnosis emergency room ( ER ) patient present shortness breath and/or chest pain without obvious cause identify . Historically , PE diagnosis require pulmonary angiography , costly invasive procedure associate morbidity even mortality . Over last 25 year , evolve diagnostic strategy develop widely validate prospective multicentre management outcome study , aim confirm exclude diagnosis PE safely enough avoid realise pulmonary angiography . Nowadays , PE diagnosis therefore relies diagnostic strategy , include sequential evaluation clinical probability , measurement plasma D-dimer level often CT pulmonary angiogram ( CTPA ) , rather standalone test . The initial essential step assessment pre-test clinical probability , either gestalt validate clinical prediction rule ( Wells rule Geneva score ) . This initial evaluation separate patient different group PE prevalence , thus directly influence negative positive predictive value diagnostic test use patient . D-dimer measurement Plasma D-dimer measurement extensively evaluated exclusion PE outpatient . The diagnostic usefulness D-dimers lie high sensitivity hence capacity exclude PE certain cut-off ( `` negative D-dimers '' ) without investigation . Indeed , patient `` non-high '' clinical probability ( low intermediate group three category score unlikely group dichotomic score ) , highly sensitive negative D-dimer test safely exclude PE without additional investigation . Sensitive D-dimer test include perform ELISA technique ( median sensitivity 99 % ; Vidas® , Stratus® , AxSYM® ) quantitative latex method ( median sensitivity 96 % ; STA Liatest® , Tinaquant® ) . In patient high clinical probability likely PE , negative predictive value even highly sensitive D-dimer test insufficient exclude PE . D-dimer measurement thus use patient . Performance D-dimers elderly patient The specificity ELISA quantitative latex D-dimer test venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) limit , range 35 40 % . Indeed , D-dimers increase various clinical situation , include cancer , infectious inflammatory state , pregnancy post-operative period , also age , lead reduce specificity test elderly patient . In word , probability negative test result reduce , number patient need test ( NNT ) exclude one PE without investigation higher . Indeed , whereas PE rule presence non-high clinical probability negative D-dimers one 3 outpatient present emergency room suspect PE , exclude one 20 patient &gt; 80 year . As current diagnostic strategy PE include image ( often CTPA ) patient positive D-dimers , lack specificity D-dimers elderly lead high proportion patient undergoing CTPA . Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off The question high D-dimer cut-off elderly patient raise decade ago , study confirm potential security strategy retrospectively apply age-adjusted cut-offs large prospective cohort consecutive patient suspect VTE publish 2010 2012 confirm safety use age-adjusted cut-offs overall population several thousand patient . A progressive age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off ( agex10 microg/L patient &gt; 50 year ) retrospectively derive validate sample 1712 patient suspect PE . The retrospective validation study show age-adjusted cut-off could increase around 20 % number patient D-dimer test consider negative , without increase proportion false-negative result compare standard cut-off ( &lt; 500 microg/L ) . The increase diagnostic yield D-dimers particularly pronounce patient 80 year , age-adjusted cut-off allow increase proportion `` negative '' D-dimers 9 % 21 % , without false negative result . This progressive age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off prospectively validate ADJUST-PE study , large multicentre multinational ( 19 centre Belgium , France , Netherlands , Switzerland ) management outcome study publish begin year . All consecutive patient present emergency department clinically suspect PE assess sequential diagnostic work-up use clinical probability assessment ( one two follow score : simplify , revise Geneva score two-level Wells score PE ) , highly sensitive D-dimer measurement ( ELISA immuno-turbidimetric assay ) , CTPA . Patients D-dimer level age-adjusted cut-off undergo investigation thus leave without anticoagulant treatment followed-up period 3 month . The ADJUST-PE study include total 3346 patient suspect PE , 22 exclude ( D-dimers perform 21 1 consent withdrawal ) , leave 3324 patient include analysis . The subgroup particular interest course patient D-dimer level 500 microg/L age-adjusted cut-off ( n=337 ) . None patient lose follow-up 6 patient receive therapeutic anticoagulation another indication VTE . Of remain 331 , 7 die 7 suspect VTE . Only one 14 event adjudicate confirm VTE ( nonfatal PE ) . The so-called `` failure-rate '' age-adjusted cut-off thus low 1 / 331 ( 0.3 % ; 95 % CI 0.1 % -1.7 % ) , strategy consider safe . In ADJUSt-PE study , overall number patient ≥ 75 year 766 , 673 non-high clinical probability ( 87.9 % ) . Among 673 patient , proportion patient D-dimer level &lt; 500 microg/L 43/673 ( 6.4 % ; 95 % CI 4.8 % -8.5 % ) . Additional 157/673 patient ( 23.3 % ) D-dimer level age-adjusted cut-off . This mean among patient ≥ 75 year suspect PE non-high clinical probability , 200/673 ( 29.7 % ; 95 % CI 26.4 % -33.3 % ) `` negative '' D-dimer result age-adjusted cut-off use . After exclude 5 patient receive anticoagulation another indication , none remain 195 patient experience confirmed VTE 3 month follow-up ( 0.0 % ; 95 % CI 0.0 % -1.9 % ) . The diagnostic yield D-dimers thus particularly increase use age-adjusted cut-off patient ≥ 75 year , number patient need test exclude one PE diminish 16 conventional cut-off 3.4 age-adjusted cut-off , figure corresponds NNT general population previous study . Increasing proportion patient PE rule base clinical probability assessment D-dimer measurement without test particularly interesting old patient . Indeed , high prevalence renal failure population increase potential risk contrast-induced nephropathy relate CTPA even contra-indicates test , ventilation-perfusion lung scan ( performed patient severe renal failure ) provide high proportion inconclusive result old patient . Moreover , rule PE base clinical probability simple blood test could contribute reduce time spend emergency department cost related PE diagnostic work-up . Indeed , previous study show D-dimer measurement conventional cut-off highly cost-saving patient le 80 year , patient 80 year . Using age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off dramatically increase proportion patient PE rule thus highly likely reduce cost PE diagnosis emergency department .</detailed_description>
