	<detailed_description>Severe haemophilia characterize frequent lifelong bleeding , 60 % bleeds occur joint . Repeated joint bleeding lead chronic synovitis , cartilage damage bony destruction , associate limitation range motion ( ROM ) , pain , muscle atrophy , functional impairment , poor quality life . The knee , elbow , ankle commonly involved joint arthropathy could worsen adolescence young adulthood . Hemophilic arthropathy multifactorial event evidence suggest iron may play major role release cytokine Interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 , tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) lead chronic proliferative synovitis , hypervascularity , progressive arthropathy . These effect cartilage subchondral bone inflammatory degenerative nature management chronic hemophilic arthropathy difficult . Currently available drug treatment hemophilic arthropathy , analgesic , corticosteroid , nonsteroid steroid anti-inflammatory drug , hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , predominantly direct toward symptomatic relief pain inflammation , little reduce joint cartilage degeneration . Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) simple minimally invasive method provide natural concentrate autologous growth factor blood . This method increasingly apply clinical practice treat musculoskeletal disorder , tendon repairment osteoarthritis . Growth factor include platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) , insulin growth factor ( IGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor , transform growth factor beta-1 believe key component PRP structural repair . Although compare PRP intra-articular soft tissue injection lead conflict result , seem PRP useful effect heal functional improvement injure tissue . To best knowledge , one study apply PRP arthropathy haemophilia . Teyssler et al report PRP could reduce pain chronic ankle synovitis hemophilia although small sample size ( n=6 ) , short term follow-up absence control group . Hyaluronic acid ( HA ) role joint mechanical support metabolic effect , cause endogenous HA synthesis , stimulation chondrocyte metabolism , synthesis cartilage matrix component , inhibition chondrodegenerative enzyme , well inflammatory process . In 1994 Fernandez-Palazzi et al firstly use intra-articular HA injection haemophiliac arthropathy report beneficial effect 2002 . Recently , Carulli et al report 27 haemophilic patient mean seven-year follow-up excellent result term pain relief functional improvement knee follow treatment HA injection . Viscosupplementation safe effective therapeutic strategy haemophilic arthropathy knee order delay surgery . The aim study investigate efficacy , safety duration benefit single PRP injection versus five weekly intra-articular injection HA patient haemophilic arthropathy knee .</detailed_description>
