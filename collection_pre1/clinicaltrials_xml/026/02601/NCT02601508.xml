	<brief_title>Compare Surgical Condition Complications With Moderate Deep NM Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular block agent ( NMBAs ) frequently use anesthesia facilitate tracheal intubation improve surgical condition . In adequately anesthetize monitored patient , presence one two response train-of-four ( TOF ) pattern normally indicate sufficient relaxation surgical procedure general practice . It call moderate neuromuscular blockade ( mNMB ) condition . Nowadays , laparoscopic surgery expand impressively various area surgery , scope volume . If hypothetical advantage deep neuromuscular blockade ( dNMB ) laparoscopic surgery turn realized practice sufficient support evidence , would become important anesthetic option well patient outcome .</detailed_description>
