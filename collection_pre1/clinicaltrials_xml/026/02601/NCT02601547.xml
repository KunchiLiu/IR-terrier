	<detailed_description>Alteration neuro-cognitive function induce chemotherapy extensively document breast carcinoma patient . These modification consist decrease memory , intellectual capacity , speed analysis , represent real limitation patient , sometimes durable . Aggressive lymphoma ( diffuse large B cell lymphomas/DLBCL ) represent common disease , standard Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide-Doxorubicine-Vincristine-Prednisone ( RCHOP ) regiment contains , breast cancer patient , anthracyclines . However , little known incidence severity cognitive function alteration patient . The occurrence complication also facilitate frail cognitive state due age co-morbidity . Cognitive function alteration usually measure neuropsychological test ( NPT ) easy handle sensitive , could lack specificity , context general degradation often observe hematological patient . Positron emission tomography 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose ( PET-FDG ) emerge promise approach detect brain lesion dementia , among Alzheimer 's disease widely study . In center , investigator already describe glucidic hypometabolism several brain territory associate Alzheimer 's disease dementia . Moreover , uptake quantification topography useful marker determine type disease progression . PET-FDG receive little attention detection chemotherapy-induced brain damage .</detailed_description>
