	<brief_summary>The project design generate critical information design justify robust trial lithium prevention onset Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Lithium exert inhibitory effect Glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK-3 ) brain biomarker neuroprotection . The study consist 3 phase : 1 . Phase 1 investigates rat establish reliable method measure brain biomarker activity level blood biomarker activity . 2 . Phase 2 determine whether GSK3 enzyme activity significantly different subject MCI compare normal individual . 3 . Phase 3 investigates patient MCI take lithium establish minimum lithium dose require inhibit activity GSK-3 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Lithium Glycogen-Synthase-Kinase-3 ( GSK-3 ) Inhibitor Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lithium use decade treat Bipolar Affective Disorder . Some therapeutic benefit inhibition enzyme Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 ( GSK-3 ) . GSK3 activity associate development several aspect AD thus lithium regulate enzyme link AD development . As important step towards design clinical trial investigate potential lithium AD prevention investigator propose establish minimum dose lithium need block GSK3 people Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) , high-risk condition progression AD . The study establish whether GSK3 activity alter MCI monitor lithium regulation GSK3 biomarkers population . At time study investigate GSK3 measure blood relates GSK3 activity brain small animal study . In preparation future large scale trial , pilot study generate technical data develop technique use Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) biomarker detect early brain change AD . Recruitment share two site study , Dundee Oxford . The study involve 12 patient MCI 12 control , ask two set blood test , 20 patient MCI consent take Lithium ask blood test regular interval . For participant study period 12 week .</detailed_description>
