	<brief_title>BOLD MRI Surrogate Improved Muscle Oxygenation Following Endovascular Therapy Treatment CLI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective single arm , open label registry evaluate feasibility blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) magnetic resonance image assessment potentially new functional surrogate alter low limb skeletal muscle oxygenation successful percutaneous endovascular intervention . Baseline MRI assessment use BOLD technique perform qualified subject prior undergo standard care endovascular therapy . Post-procedure BOLD-MRI assessment also perform 30 day either 90 180 day post-procedure . Post-MR image acquisition process analysis perform , use pre-determined algorithm , core laboratory .</detailed_description>
