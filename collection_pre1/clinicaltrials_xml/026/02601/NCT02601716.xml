	<brief_title>PfSPZ Vaccine : Dose Optimization With Heterologous Challenge Healthy Malaria-Naïve Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct collaborative effort NMRC , UMB CVD , WRAIR Sanaria , Inc . The study screening , immunization follow-ups Groups 1 &amp; 2 take place UMB CVD . The study screening , immunization follow-ups Groups 3 &amp; 4 take place NMRC CTC Bethesda , MD . The controlled human malaria infection ( CHMI ) conduct WRAIR Entomology , Silver Spring , MD NMRC subject , UMB CVD UMB CVD subject . There 4 group total 84 subject ( 60 immunize subject 24 infectivity control ) . Group 1 ( n=15 ) subject receive PfSPZ Vaccine administer DVI 4 dose 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ give every two day , follow single , boost dose 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ give 16 week later total PfSPZ dose 22.5 x 10^5 . Group 2 ( n=15 ) subject receive PfSPZ Vaccine administer DVI 9.0 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose , administer every 8 week total 3 dos , total PfSPZ dose 27 x 10^5 . Group 3 subject receive PfSPZ Vaccine administer direct venous inoculation ( DVI ) 18 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose , administer every 8 week total three dos , total PfSPZ dose 54 x 10^5 . Group 4 subject receive 27 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose , administer prim dose , follow 9.0 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose , administer every 8 week total two dos , total PfSPZ dose 45 x 10^5 . Protective efficacy assess CHMI , conduct exposure bite five mosquito infect heterologous ( 7G8 ) Pf parasites . At NMRC , protective efficacy assess 24 week final immunization Groups 3 4 . At UMB CVD , protective efficacy assess 12 24 week final immunization , Groups 1 2 . These subject may participate second CHMI whether protect first CHMI , serve control effect first CHMI immunity . Subjects may proceed CHMI provide receive least two three immunization schedule Groups 2-4 , least two four priming immunization well boost schedule Group 1 . Two subject Groups 3 4 immunized day rest subject respective group ( refer `` pilot subject '' ) first immunization . The procedure sequence event immunization pilot subject , rest subject respective group specific study site . If safety concern identify pilot subject trigger stop rule , remainder subject immunize day pilot subject immunize . Subjects follow 56 day beyond 24-week CHMI take place 24 week final immunization ( post-immunization week 40 ) .</detailed_description>

Physical examination laboratory result without clinically significant finding body mass index ( BMI ) ≤35 vaccine group BMI ≤40 control group . Women childbearing potential must agree use effective mean birth control ( e.g . oral implanted contraceptive , IUD , female condom , diaphragm spermicide , cervical cap , abstinence , use condom sexual partner sterile sexual partner ) entire study . Women history surgical chemical sterilization ( e.g . tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ) must provide write documentation infertility health care provider . Willing refrain blood donation 3 year follow CHMI . Agree travel malaria endemic region entire course trial . Any history malaria infection , travel malaria endemic region within 6 month prior first immunization . History longterm residence ( &gt; 5 year ) area know significant transmission P. falciparum . Body weight equal , less , 110 pound Has evidence increase cardiovascular disease risk ( define &gt; 10 % , 5 year risk ) determine method Gaziano [ Gaziano , 2008 ] . Risk factor include sex , age , systolic blood pressure ( mm Hg ) , smoke status , body mass index ( BMI , kg/mm2 ) , report diabetes status . Positive HIV , HBsAg HCV serology . Positive sickle cell screen test . An abnormal electrocardiogram , define one show pathologic Q wave significant STT wave change ; leave ventricular hypertrophy ; nonsinus rhythm include isolated premature ventricular contraction , exclude isolated premature atrial contraction ; right leave bundle branch block ; advance ( secondary tertiary ) AV heart block . Current use systemic immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy . Current significant medical condition ( cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , hematological ) evidence serious underlie medical condition identify medical history , physical examination , laboratory examination . History splenectomy . History neurologic disorder ( include seizure ) diagnosis migraine headache . History psychiatric disorder ( personality disorder , anxiety disorder , schizophrenia ) behavioral tendency ( include active alcohol drug abuse ) discover screen process opinion investigator would make compliance protocol difficult . Plan surgery enrollment CHMI . Females pregnant nursing , females plan become pregnant plan nurse study period . Known allergy component vaccine formulation , history anaphylactic response mosquitobites , history anaphylactic reaction , retinal visual field change , know allergy antimalarial include chloroquine phosphate , atovaquone/proguanil ( Malarone® ) , artemether/lumefantrine ( Coartem® ) Receipt another investigational vaccine drug within 30 day prior first immunization , plan participate another investigational vaccine/drug research within 1 month follow participation study . Participation study involve another investigational vaccine drug within 60 day prior screen visit , plan participate another investigational vaccine/drug research within 1 month follow participation study . Personal beliefs prohibit receive vaccine product contain human serum albumin within diluent ( vaccine recipient ) . Use plan use drug antimalarial activity would coincide period immunization CHMI . Anticipated use medication know cause drug reaction atovaquoneproguanil ( Malarone® ) , artemether/lumefantrine ( Coartem® ) cimetidine , metoclopramide , antacid , kaolin . History illness condition , investigator 's judgment , may substantially increase risk associate subject 's participation protocol compromise scientific objective .</criteria>
