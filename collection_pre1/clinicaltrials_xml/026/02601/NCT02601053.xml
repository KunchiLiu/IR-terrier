	<brief_title>The Fear F8ctor Study - Does Fear Induce Blood Curdling State ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : For century term `` blood curling '' use describe extreme frighten situation . The term date back medieval physiology , believe human body contain four chief fluid , blood , phlegm , bile black bile . It think fear horror would 'run blood cold ' 'curdle ' ( solidify ) . To date large part complex mechanism coagulation cascade unravelled many risk factor clot , i.e. , thrombosis identify . However , origin ancient theory never study remains unknown fear induces coagulation system . Objective : To explore effect acute fear coagulation system sit still . The investigator compare systemic coagulation marker movie subject : 13 subject expose horrify movie first , follow dull movie ( least 1 week later ) . Both movie show day week , time day last approximately 90 minute . One group 13 first view horrify movie , follow dull move next week ( Group I ) 13 subject expose dull movie first , follow horrifying movie ( Group II ) . Spacious seat use avoid effect immobilisation due tight cinema seat . Blood drawn four time point ( TP ) ; ( 0 ) first movie ( baseline ) , first movie ( 1 ) , second movie ( 2 ) second movie ( 3 ) . A needle puncture use collect 12 ml blood time point . Individual marker coagulation activity determine blood sample . Pulse rate measure anxiety/fear score collected student movie .</detailed_description>
