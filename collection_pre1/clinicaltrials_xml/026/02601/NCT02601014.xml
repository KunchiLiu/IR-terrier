	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well nivolumab ipilimumab work treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer spread place body express androgen receptor-variant-7 ( AR-V7 ) . Tumor cell express AR-V7 show resistant hormone therapy chemotherapy patient prostate cancer . Biomarker-driven therapy , nivolumab ipilimumab , may work block key biomarkers protein help tumor cell escape immune system surveillance may help immune system kill tumor cell express AR-V7 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker-Driven Therapy With Nivolumab Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer Expressing AR-V7</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To evaluate effect administration nivolumab ipilimumab proportion prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response ( &gt; 50 % PSA decline ) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) patient detectable AR‐V7 transcript circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES ; 1 . To evaluate safety tolerability ipilimumab + nivolumab AR‐V7-positive patient . 2 . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) . 3 . To determine PSA‐PFS . 4 . To determine proportion `` durable '' response . 5 . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) . 6 . To determine overall survival ( OS ) . 7 . To evaluate change AR‐V7 detection ( expression level ) treatment ipilimumab + nivolumab correlate PSA responses . 8 . To explore potential biomarkers associate clinical efficacy ( ORR , PFS , OS ) nivolumab ipilimumab analyze absolute lymphocyte count peripheral blood well program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD‐L1 ) expression CTCs and/or tumor biopsy , immune profile serum tumor tissue . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 3 week 12 week . Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute every 2 week 36 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 100 day every 3 month .</detailed_description>
