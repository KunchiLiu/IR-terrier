	<brief_summary>18F-FDOPA PET expensive . It mandatory therefore assess impact management patient high-grade gliomas order provide medico-economic justification use . The article UCLA group show 18F-FDOPA modified 41 % management decision patient brain tumor ( Walter JNM 2012 ) . However , study comprise 58 patient , combine primary recur tumor , base questionnaire send refer physician . A targeted study need , therefore , make prospective multicenter assessment contribution technique context high-grade glial tumor neurooncology MCCs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>POSitron Emission Imaging Using 18F-FDOPA Neurooncology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment high-grade glioma combine surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy enhance overall survival past 10 year , notably thank `` Stupp `` protocol use Temozolomide . At tumor evaluation post-treatment follow-up , decision regard management ( change , discontinuation continuation treatment ) discuss multidisciplinary case conference ( MCC ) neurooncology specialist generally base primarily MRI data . New treatment strategy effective tumor tissue also affect adjacent healthy tissue . These phenomenon give rise complex MRI change make difficult perform differential diagnosis tumor recurrence treatment sequellae , radionecrosis pseudoprogression . Alternatively , conceal effective tumor progression ( appearance pseudoresponse antiangiogenics ) . Classical MRI interpretation criterion evolve take phenomenon account ( RANO criterion ) supplement new MRI data ( perfusion diffusion imaging , spectroscopy ) . Nonetheless , case involve uncertain recurrence diagnosis still frequent . PET image also show good result differential diagnosis posttreatment change . Fluorodeoxyglucose-18-F ( 18FDG ) use glioma follow-up ( Varrone EJNMMI 2009 ) produce false positive follow-up . In set , over-expression amino acid transporter LAT-1 brain tumor make amino acid mark analog suitable PET image glial tumor . C-11 methionine 18F-FET use , 18F-FDOPA currently radiopharmaceutical agent receive marketing authorization France . Recently , UCLA group demonstrate 18F-FDOPA could modify intended management 41 % patient brain tumor . The present project aim assess impact 18F-FDOPA PET imaging decision take neurooncology MCCs management patient already treat high-grade glioma . Expected benefit patient term Public Health High-grade glioma commonest aggressive brain tumor . Current therapy combine several treatment ( surgery , radiotherapy , radiosurgery chemotherapy ) improve overall patient survival past 10 year . Nevertheless , tumor recurrence account median survival approximately 15 month .</detailed_description>
