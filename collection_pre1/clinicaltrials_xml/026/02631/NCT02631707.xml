	<detailed_description>This pilot project randomise control trial 24 participant . Diets consist 1200 1500kcals female male , respectively . The control arm receive Ministry Health guideline percentage energy carbohydrate ( 50-55 % ) , protein ( 10-15 % ) fat ( 30 % ) . The intervention arm low carbohydrate ( 40 % ) , high protein ( 30 % ) , moderate fat ( 30 % ) . Participants require continue diet least 8 week wait surgery . At baseline eight week weight , hip circumference , waist circumference , neck circumference body composition measurement take . During prescribed diet require fill 3-day diet record . At end eight week participant perform twenty-four hour urine collect urea creatinine . This help determine adherence . Post-surgery ( 21-28 day ) require complete surgical recovery questionnaire measurement record . These data collect period begin January 2015 . It expect intervention arm great weight loss well preservation muscle mass lead good surgical recovery score . However intervention require high intake protein may effect adherence acceptability participant . There known adverse effect intervention diet short term .</detailed_description>
