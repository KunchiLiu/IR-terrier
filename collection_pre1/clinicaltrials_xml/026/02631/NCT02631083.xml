	<brief_title>The Influence Glucose Flux Fat Synthesis Whole Body Calorimeter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The GI method classify food base food 's ability raise blood glucose level . Low GI food recommend low impact blood glucose concentration . The research set determine effect GI 24 hour blood glucose profile energy regulation Asians . Healthy , normal-weight , Chinese male recruit . There two session ( consist four day session ) consume either high low GI breakfast , lunch , snack ( whole body calorimeter ) , high low glycaemic index dinner home . They take part two test session ( span 3 day ) least five day two session . Their glycaemic response measure use Continuous Glucose Monitoring System ( CGMS ) throughout period , substrate oxidation measure 10 hour calorimeter ( breakfast , lunch snack ) . This study specifically attempt see high low GI meal impact blood glucose level energy regulation Asians . The study important first kind whole body calorimeter enable u compute rate fat synthesis modulate subject feed high GI diet ( increase glucose excursion ) low GI diet ( blunt glucose ) 24 hour healthy Asians . Obesity diabetes rate increase exponentially Asian population Singapore exception . Devising way mean staunch escalation therefore priority . The finding research contribute towards long-term objective develop Asian specific dietary guideline weight glycaemic control . The study data also important provision practical food-based advocacy well weight glycaemic control Singaporeans .</detailed_description>
