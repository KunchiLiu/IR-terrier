	<brief_title>Liposomal Irinotecan Veliparib Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability escalate dos MM-398 ( liposomal irinotecan ) + veliparib combination . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination MM-398 + veliparib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-tumor activity . II . To characterize preliminary efficacy combination use key efficacy indicator , objective response rate , clinical benefit rate define complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) 24 week , progression free survival ( PFS ) . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES I . Imaging , tumor , blood biomarkers assess sensitivity resistance drug correlation clinical response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation veliparib . Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 15 veliparib orally ( PO ) day 5-12 19-25 3-12 17-25 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
