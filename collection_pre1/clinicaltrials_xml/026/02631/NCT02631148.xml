	<brief_summary>In 6 week pilot study , 20 individual habitual sleep restriction ask extend nightly sleep 1 hour , randomize 1:1 nightly controlled-release oral melatonin ( 2mg ) placebo . The investigator assess whether sleep extension nightly melatonin supplementation community feasible intervention beneficial effect follow chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) risk factor : systemic renal specific renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system ( RAAS ) activation ( systemic plasma renin activity , plasma angiotensin II level , 24-hour urine aldosterone excretion , renal plasma flow response captopril ) ; nocturnal blood pressure measure 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor ; central blood pressure measure pulse wave analysis ; glucose metabolism measure Minimal Model assessment insulin resistance β-cell response mixed meal protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator recruit individual Boston area meet inclusion exclusion criterion . The investigator include men woman race ethnicity . The exception woman pregnant certain medication use inpatient evaluation ( e.g. , nitroglycerine ) , certain study medication ( i.e. , captopril ) contraindicate pregnancy . Participant Enrollment Responders advertisements pre-screened telephone obtain body mass index ( BMI ) estimate medical history gauge potential eligibility . For participant may eligible follow phone query , basic study schema describe identify remain interested participation learn duration , inpatient requirement , potential medication use . These individual invite attend outpatient screen visit . The pilot study double-blind , placebo-controlled randomized trial , 16 subject obesity ( body mass index [ BMI ] ≥30 kg/m2 ) , pre-diabetes ( hemoglobin A1C [ HbA1C ] , 5.7-6.4 % ) , self-reported short sleep duration ( &lt; 7 hours/night ) randomly assign 1:1 receive either placebo 2 mg controlled-release melatonin , take orally every evening 1 hour bed 6 week . All subject ask extend sleep time one hour 6 week period inpatient visit . Endpoints measure baseline 6-week inpatient visit . Screening Visit : Screening visit take place Brigham Women 's Outpatient Center Clinical Investigation During outpatient screen , Dr. McMullan explain study detail , review consent form , answer question . After obtain write informed consent participation , history physical examination perform order initially judge eligibility base upon criterion set section record . Participants deem potentially eligible base upon screen history exam undergo phlebotomy analysis HbA1c , serum chemistry glucose , complete blood count ( CBC ) confirm eligibility use criterion present table . Study Procedures Pre-admission : All participant wear wrist activity monitor total 8 week ; 2 week prior baseline inpatient visit 6 week inpatient visit . Participants complete daily sleep log 2 week precede visit . Three day admission , participant place high salt diet supplement usual diet 150 millimoles ( mmol ) sodium/day 3 day use dry bouillon add food . Treatment assignment : Prior admission baseline visit , participant randomize ( 1:1 ) receive study medication ( melatonin 2mg control release formulation placebo ) . All participant ask extend sleep time one hour 6 week period inpatient visit . Baseline Follow-up inpatient visit : Baseline 6-week inpatient visit virtually identical . Each inpatient visit begin 4:00PM Day 0 end 4:00 PM Day 1 . Day 0 — All participant begin 24 hour urine collection admission Brigham Women 's Hospital Center Clinical Investigation ( CCI ) even day 0 . The 24-hour urine collection continue overnight ( nurse keep daytime ( 8AM 8PM ) nighttime ( 8PM 8AM ) urine separate permit analysis diurnal variation urinary analytes ) . Subjects fast 9 pm ensure 12-hour fast next morning . Day 1 —At 8 , central blood pressure vascular compliance assess , follow approximately 9 measurement renal specific RAAS activity via para-aminohippurate ( PAH ) renal plasma flow test captopril , systemic renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system ( RAAS ) measure plasma renin activity ( PRA ) , plasma angiotensin II ( Ang II ) urine aldosterone . Next participant receive mixed meal ( 10kcal/kg , 45 % carbohydrate , 15 % protein , 40 % fat , 1g/kg glucose ) consume 15 minute blood draws 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 60 , 90 120 minute time meal begin consume . Plasma glucose , insulin c-peptide measure 7 sample blood . The 24-hour urine collection conclude 4 pm day 1 used measure 24-hour excretion sodium aldosterone . Finally participant fit Spacelabs 90207 ambulatory blood pressure ( BP ) monitor prior discharge worn 24-hours . Follow-up — During study , participant phone weekly study coordinator ass compliance potential side effect . Dr McMullan call subject every 2 week discuss difficulty encounter new sleep schedule , recommend improvement encourage compliance protocol . Parameters Measured : At inpatient visit , follow measurement make : Renal Specific renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system ( RAAS ) — The activity local kidney RAAS measure examine change effective renal plasma flow ( RPF ) oral captopril high sodium balance . Effective RPF measure clearance para-aminohippuric acid ( PAH ) , PAH clear solely nearly entirely kidney . The protocol measure PAH clearance perform participant supine . Systemic renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system ( RAAS ) — plasma renin activity ( PRA ) angiotensin II ( Ang II ) level measure first morning blood draw . Central Blood Pressure — Will measure use pulse wave analysis use SphygmoCor system ( AtCor Medical , West Ryde , New South Wales , Australia ) , measure central blood pressure arterial stiffness . Glucose metabolism — Will evaluate apply Oral Minimal Model method result 2 hour 7- measurement , mixed meal tolerance test.2 Subject give breakfast form mixed meal ( 10kcal/kg , 45 % carbohydrate , 15 % protein , 40 % fat , 1g/kg glucose ) must consume within 15 minute glucose , insulin c-peptide measure arterialized blood drawn 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 60 , 90 120 minute start meal . From glucose , insulin c-peptide measurement calculation insulin sensitivity ( reciprocal insulin resistance ) β-cell responsivity calculate . Data Collection : This study collect demographic information ( age , self-described race ethnicity , sex ) , physical data ( height , weight , screen blood pressure ) . Blood urine sample analyze various biomarkers collect data necessary carry specific aim , describe section . All data record association study identification ( ID ) number , keep secure excel file statistician programmer . The individually identifiable private data collect name , address , contact phone number participant screen follow-up phone call , admit inpatient CCI name . This personal information , however , associate result obtain various test perform , latter associate study ID number . The file link study ID number personally identifiable information keep Principal Investigator secure location violate unless becomes medically necessary contact participant basis one lab screening test ( e.g. , elevate liver function test ) .</detailed_description>
