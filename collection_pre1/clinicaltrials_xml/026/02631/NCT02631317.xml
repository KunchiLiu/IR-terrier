	<brief_summary>PROMISE prospective , nationwide , multicenter , longitudinal cohort study , focus hospital intravenous thrombolysis process reengineering acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) . With propose `` Reengineered Process Framework '' intravenous thrombolysis process PROMISE study steer committee , 30 medical center enters would recruit nationwide , center would include consecutive AIS patient onset-to-door time ( ODT ) less 3.5 h. The investigator hypothesize propose `` Reengineered Process Framework '' suitable feasible hospital mainland China ; rate intravenous rt-PA thrombolysis ischemic stroke patient ODT le 3.5 h would 20 % increase 40 % compare baseline ; proportion patient door-to-needle ( DNT ) time le 60 min would 20 % , increase â‰¥ 40 % compare baseline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hospital Processes Reengineering Intravenous Thrombolysis Acute Ischemic Stroke China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . After review domestic international clinical research literature , PROMISE study steer committee construct `` Reengineered Process Framework '' intravenous thrombolysis process business process reengineering theory . The suggested `` Reengineered Process Framework '' regard feasible suitable hospital mainland China . 2 . The study period 12 month , first 3 month baseline period . After 3 month , center develop new thrombolytic process accord `` Reengineered Process Framework '' . The new process gradually implement since 4th month continue care quality improvement . 3 . The `` Reengineered Process Framework '' adopt form comprehensive package , propose unified key point process reengineering , provide series support , standardized tool process management , establish real-time key performance indicator ( KPI ) monitor feedback system , etc . 4 . Supporting , standardized tool include : rapid identification tool suspect stroke medical personnel emergency system ; stroke team building program ; real-time feedback form KPI ; standardize thrombolysis inform consent form inform conversation public service advertising poster ; suggest indication contraindication intravenous thrombolysis ; standard operation procedure intravenous rt-PA thrombolysis , etc . With method , expect raise thrombolytic rate patient arrive medical center within 3.5 hour onset , shorten door needle time China .</detailed_description>
