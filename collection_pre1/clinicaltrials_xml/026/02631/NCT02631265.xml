	<brief_summary>It report insulin basal rate reduction initiate exercise onset reduce hypoglycemic risk exercise . However , another potentially efficient strategy prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia could reduce insulin basal rate certain time prior exercise . No study investigate would best time initiate temporary basal insulin reduction . Therefore , objective study compare efficacy three strategy prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia 45 min exercise 60 % VO2peak ( moderate intensity ) : 1 ) reduce insulin basal rate time exercise ; 2 ) reduce insulin basal rate 20 minute prior exercise ; 3 ) reduce insulin basal rate 40 minute prior exercise . Investigators hypothesize time spend hypoglycemia less insulin basal rate reduce 40 minute prior exercise compare reduction time exercise . Secondary hypothesis : 1 ) Time spent hypoglycemia less insulin basal rate reduce 20 minute prior exercise compare reduction time exercise ; 2 ) Time spent hypoglycemia less insulin basal rate reduce 40 minute prior exercise compare reduction 20 minute prior exercise .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Males females ≥ 18 year old . 2 . Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes least one year . 3 . The subject insulin pump therapy least 3 month . 4 . Last ( less 2 month ) HbA1c ≤ 12 % . 1 . Clinically significant microvascular complication : nephropathy ( estimate glomerular filtration rate 40 ml/min ) , neuropathy ( especially diagnose gastroparesis ) severe proliferative retinopathy judge investigator . 2 . Recent ( &lt; 3 month ) acute macrovascular event e.g . acute coronary syndrome cardiac surgery . 3 . Abnormal blood panel and/or anemia . 4 . Ongoing pregnancy . 5 . Severe hypoglycemic episode within two week screen . 6 . Other serious medical illness likely interfere study participation ability complete exercise period judgment investigator ( e.g . orthopedic limitation ) . 7 . Failure comply team 's recommendation ( e.g . willing change pump parameter , etc . ) .</criteria>
