	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate safety feasibility radiofrequency ( RF ) system employ RFITT ( CelonProSurge ) probe ablative treatment uterine fibroid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radio Frequency Ablation ( RFA STUDY )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>10 consecutive premenopausal woman symptomatic uterine fibroid responsive medical therapy ( include progestin , oral contraceptive , anti-inflammatory drug ) recruit hospital submit abdominal myomectomy . All patient counsel potential risk benefit procedure give write consent . Procedures perform hospital patient general anesthesia.All patient submit abdominal myomectomy . Target leiomyomas intramural , 5-15 cm diameter . Intra-operative RF ablation carry followed surgical removal treat leiomyoma . After remove fibroid , send pathologist . Specimens fibroid fix immediately 10 % neutral formaline solution approximately 3h , embed paraffin , cut 4mm section stain along direction RFA electrode . Pathologic confirmation ablation assess follow : specimen leiomyoma examine grossly histologic leiomyoma subtype pathologic finding represent treatment , include necrosis , hemorrhage , fibrosis , use hematoxylin eosin stain . Treated area measure large orthogonal dimension planar cut surface third dimension estimate sum affected 0.5-cm-thick sagittal plane . RF ablation volume calculate use prolate ellipsoid formula . The relationship thermal dose estimate pathology assess use Bland-Altman analysis intra-class correlation . The surgical procedure conclude usual step standard approach .</detailed_description>
