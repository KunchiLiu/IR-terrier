	<brief_summary>The potential role ATIII achieve maintain adequate anticoagulation pediatric patient heart-lung machine recently take increased importance caregiver strive mitigate risk clinically significant clot problem . It known ATIII level decrease normal neonate infant le 6 month age relative old child adults become even decreased critically ill neonate infant , include congenital heart disease . The current utilization ATIII context support heart-lung machine base pharmacokinetic data derive adult subject congenital ATIII deficiency . There gap knowledge appropriate frequency ATIII repletion , best method monitoring , mode administration critically ill neonate infant receive support heart-lung machine.Our long-term goal determine antithrombin ( ATIII ) effectively change coagulation system patient undergo heart-lung machine support . The objective proposal , first step pursuit goal , determine pharmacokinetics ATIII neonates infant . Our central hypothesis ATIII different pharmacokinetic property neonates infant adults property affect use heart-lung machine . This research result critical data pharmacokinetics ATIII neonates infant receive heart-lung machine support . This contribution significant first step continuum research expect lead development therapeutic strategy employ ATIII facilitate improve modulation coagulation cascade prevent significant clot bleed complication pediatric patient require heart-lung machine support .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Of The Pharmacokinetics Of Antithrombin III In Neonates And Infants Undergoing CPB And ECMO Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-site , prospective , open-label , pharmacokinetic study hpATIII neonates infant . Patients admit Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center ( CCHMC ) enrol . Participants enrol one three cohort depend whether schedule ECMO , CPB , neither , base age ( neonate infant ) . Two dos hpATIII use ; one accord current labelling hpATIII one account additional circuit volume ECMO CPB . Pharmacokinetic measurement obtain group baseline prior administration hpATIII multiple define time 120 hr follow administration hpATIII . Administration hpATIII standard care CCHMC participant undergo ECMO . The standard dose administer clinical care ( 120 - baseline AT activity level ) x weight ( kg ) / 1.4 . For participant undergo ECMO clinical care , undergo ECMO receive adjust dose additional circuit volume , administration hpATIII consider research . The duration study CCHMC expect 2.5 year . This include 24 month recruitment data collection , 6 month data analysis report write . Individual participant study approximately 120 hour ( 5 day ) follow administration hpATIII . If participant receive 1 dose , study approximately 120 hour follow dose hpATIII receive .</detailed_description>
