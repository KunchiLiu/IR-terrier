	<brief_summary>The purpose study observe whether hepatic infusion oxaliplatin , irinotecan raltitrexed without embolization lipiodol microspheres effective treatment refratory liver metastasis colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety TACE With Oxaliplatin , Irinotecan Raltitrexed Refractory Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer one popular cancer worldwide . Patients liver metastasis poor prognosis except curative resection . Chemotherapy combine biologic agent improve mCRC median progress free survival median overall surivival , difficult deal liver lesion FOLFOX FOLFIRI treatment fail . We aim observe safety efficacy hepatic infusion embolization oxaliplatin , irinotecan raltitrexed treatment refratory liver metastasis colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
