	<brief_title>Effect Falls Reduction Multimodal Intervention Frail Pre-frail Elderly Community-dwelling People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The World Health Organization ( WHO ) define fall result event precipitate patient , involuntarily . Along instability gait disturbance , fall one great geriatric syndrome second cause death worldwide unintentional injury . In field public health , fall elderly consider major biopsychosocial problem due medical , psychological , social family economic consequence . It estimate 2020 cost generate social health care fall 30,000 million euro . This 20 % fall require medical attention , approximately 10 % consultation emergency service 6 % urgent hospitalization elderly . Mortality elderly people result fall nearly 40,000 death annually Europe , obtain Spain mortality rate 15 . It also high morbidity , decline directly relate decreased mobility ability perform basic activity daily live , raise fear new fall thus favoring loss one 's safety . Thus dependence caregiver institutionalization home increase , turn , family , social economic impact . Falls elderly , unlike adult , result adaptive imbalance person environment . The clinician relativizes problem attribute fall normal age process ignore potential consequence : injury , disability , institutionalization even death population . For reason , fall consider factor frailty elderly . The performance health worker fall elderly patient consist realization follow measure : - Conduct comprehensive assessment elderly : biomedical , functional , social , mental psycho-sphere . - Identify intrinsic , extrinsic risk factor circumstance fall . - Estimate early physical , psychological socio-economic consequence . - Prevention fall primary , secondary tertiary level . Frailty pathophysiological syndrome characterize decreased functional reserve mainly link loss muscle mass sarcopenia . This caused decline physical activity , associate turn poor health habit , cardiovascular risk factor various chronic disease . The consequence elderly affect multiple system , cause great vulnerability external agent increase risk : disability , hospitalization , institutionalization death . The prevalence frailty subject 65 year 7 16.3 % , increase every decade age . The diagnostic criterion fragility , describe Linda Fried , include assessment functional aspect gait assessment , exhaustion strength palmar pressure weight loss energy consumption associate physical activity . Since therapeutic perspective , one best way reverse frailty physical exercise . Several article describe heterogeneous effect physical intervention elderly frailty people , range isolated program aerobic , anaerobic balance different combination training . A multicomponent exercise program increase muscle strength , improve cardiorespiratory fitness balance11 . Exercise program observe improvement symptom depression elderly patients10 3 month completion program . This benefit may due increased central monoamine activity increase secretion beta-endorphin . Similarly , link exercise program improvement various cognitive domain , especially executive function . A 2003 meta-analysis indicates combine program aerobic anaerobic exercise well outcome cognitive status design aerobic program . STUDY JUSTIFICATION Nearly six million Spanish people older 70 year , 12.64 % Spanish population elderly . The first study Spain fall elderly conducted 1985 , encourage investigation . Practice guideline care geriatric population recommend perform annual screening fall . Moreover , suggest advice elderly possible risk factor associate . However , one problem interfere fall prevention program lack importance accord health professional fall . This lack awareness risk face associate geriatric population fall generate reluctance adherence fall prevention program . At European level gap knowledge real effectiveness efficiency fall prevention program . Add practice physical activity nursing intervention , environment community , show reduction use emergency service relatively short interval , probably due improve continuity care . The Hunter study show train program low-level resistance ( twice week ) associate decrease progression functional limitation within 6 month . Physical activity associate interdisciplinary approach improve overall assessment frail elderly population functional , psychological , cognitive , clinical social part , , , . It necessary create interdisciplinary team daily clinical practice frail patient perform adequately full recognition patient follow characteristic : - Shared management nursing primary care . - Support staff ( nurse , social worker ) specialize training gerontology . - Audit home technical device need . - Regular team meeting evaluate change . - Establishment communication community resource incremental improvement home , health promotion support caregiver . HYPOTHESIS The implementation multicomponent fall prevention program frail pre-frail elderly community-dwelling people reduce incidence fall . OBJECTIVES General : • To determine efficacy comprehensive program prevent fall community . Specific : - Knowing whether reduce incidence fall implies reduction visit primary care , emergency department hospital stay . - Knowing adhesion , indirect measure , intervention program . - Knowing nutritional , functional , cognitive , social , anthropometric , respiratory clinical profile , include fall , sample . MATERIAL AND METHODS Study design : Multicenter community intervention study , longitudinal , prospective , randomize , experimental . Through intervention nurse primary care education subject 70 year know effectiveness comprehensive program fall prevention .</detailed_description>
