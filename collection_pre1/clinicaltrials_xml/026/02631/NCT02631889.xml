	<brief_summary>Major lung resection one common procedure perform thoracic surgery , may involve considerable bleed occasional need transfusion and/or reoperation bleed specific case . In addition , lysis pleural-parenchymal adhesion dissection represent challenge patient undergone chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy , patient bronchiectasis COPD . Several intraoperative method use manage blood loss , include topical haemostatic agent , bipolar sealer electrocautery . Transcollation technology ( TT ) consist disposable bipolar sealer use radiofrequency coagulation system deliver saline solution provide haemostatic seal soft tissue bone provide localized cool without char . Blood loss reduction previously describe several field surgery . The primary end-point propose trial ass ability Transcollation Technology reduce proportion patient show bleed perioperatively within set prospective randomize controlled trial . The secondary end-point ass Transcollation Technology able improve postoperative outcome reduce length hospital stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Effectiveness Transcollation Technology Reduce Bleeding Lung Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participation start signature inform consent subject assess preoperatively , within 4 week surgery . A patient information leaflet form basis discussion patient write informed consent obtain . Patients evaluate intra-operatively , 24 48 hour surgery , discharge . At preoperative visit , follow information record patient 's Case Report Form specialist Registrar : - Patient number - Patient initial - Date visit - Demography ( date birth , sex , height , weight ) - Preoperative FEV1 % predict FEV1 - Co-morbidities ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ yes/no ] , current smoking habit [ yes/no ] ) - level hemoglobin ( preoperative , postoperative , 24 h , 48 h discharge ) - perioperative complication . Interventions Patients undergo Major Lung Surgery randomly assign one two management strategy start operation : 1 . Electrocautery Using routine instrument hilar dissection , hemostasis lisys eventual pleural adhesion . 2 . Transcollation Technology Using Transcollation Technology hilar dissection , hemostasis lisys eventual pleural adhesion . Randomization Patients randomize 1:1 ratio Transcollation technology ( TT ) electrocautery . Patients allocate two different group follow block randomization seal envelope . This study open-label : patient , investigator . Allocation concealment The nature treatment precludes blind surgeon administer intervention . However , allocate , monitor measurement primary secondary endpoint make dedicated investigator without knowledge , reference , treatment allocation ( electrocautery Transcollation technology ) . A dedicated investigator provide series seal envelope , contain randomize treatment allocation . The operating surgeon ascertain treatment allocation eligible patient open next available seal randomization envelope . For patient , open envelope attached Case Report Form statistical analysis . Sample Size Group sample size 77 77 achieve 90 % power detect difference 65,0 ml chest drain fluid 24 h null hypothesis group mean chest drain fluid 425,0 ml alternative hypothesis mean group 2 360,0 ml know group standard deviation 124,0 ml , significance level ( alpha ) 0,05 use two-sided two-sample t-test . We consider 10 % drop-out recruit 170 patient .</detailed_description>
