	<brief_summary>To evaluate best sequence approach combination target agent ( LGX818 plus MEK162 ) combination immunomodulatory antibody ( ipilimumab plus nivolumab ) patient metastatic melanoma BRAF V600 mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Combo Immuno Target Therapy ( SECOMBIT ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination BRAF ( B-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 ) inhibitor plus mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor seem effective V600 BRAF mutate advanced melanoma patient compare treatment BRAF inhibitor alone . In fact , phase I-II study show good overall response rate ( ORR ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) combination arm ( dabrafenib plus trametinib ) respect single agent treatment ( dabrafenib ) : 76 % 9.4 month versus 54 % 5.8 month respectively . Another phase I study similar combination ( vemurafenib plus cobimetinib ) show ORR 85 % vemurafenib-naïve patient . Recently , result phase I study combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab report . In study select schedule ( ipilimumab 3 mg/kg nivolumab 1 mg/kg ) , 53 % patient objective response , tumor reduction 80 % . Reponses durable , although long follow-up need . A recent phase I study show high rate liver toxicity combo ipilimumab plus vemurafenib . make difficult combination two different drug . Moreover , good efficacy sequence treatment BRAF inhibitors/ipilimumab vs. single agent treatment also observe ; reason also suggest start immunotherapy treatment BRAF V600 mutate melanoma population first option , order increase percentage patient benefit sequence , consider possibility fast progression disease BRAF inhibitor treatment . Taking account consideration , seem impossible think combine four compound ( target agent immunomodulating monoclonal antibody ) . The risk high rate toxicity realistic would render approach inapplicable . Sequencing different combination seem feasible . However , also case would important start best combination order give patient best chance increase overall survival . The aim prospective randomize phase II study evaluate sequence two different combination evaluate best approach .</detailed_description>
