	<brief_summary>This study multi-national , multi-center , double-blind ( sponsor open ) , randomize , placebo-controlled trial subject active primary Sjögren 's syndrome design understand safety tolerability profile belimumab/ rituximab co-administration belimumab monotherapy ; evaluate whether either co-administration therapy belimumab monotherapy substantive effect disease activity . This study consist screen period , double blind treatment period , general follow-up period individualize follow-up period . Approximately 70 subject recruit study initially . At Day 0 , subject randomize 1:2:2:2 one four treatment arm placebo arm , belimumab monotherapy arm , co-administration therapy arm rituximab monotherapy arm . Once sufficient number subject complete Week 24 , interim analysis sample size re-estimation conduct . The total number subject randomize may increase follow sample size re-estimation maximum 120 recruit study . Subjects arm receive investigational product ( IP ) Week 52 ( completion treatment phase ) . All subject enter 16-week general follow-up period Week 52 visit discontinuation subject discontinues IP withdraw treatment phase visit prior Week 52 . After complete general follow-up period , subject cluster differentiation ( CD ) 19+ B-cell level low limit normal ( less 90 percent [ % ] baseline , baseline value lower limit normal [ LLN ] ) enter individualize safety follow-up phase return clinic visit every 12 week monthly call visit evaluate subject serious adverse event ( SAEs ) relate IP study participation , fatal SAEs , designate adverse event special interest ( AESIs ) ( i.e. , infection , malignancy , depression , suicide/self-injury ) , check concomitant medication . The total duration participation subject study approximately maximum 2 year ( i.e. , Week 104 ) .</brief_summary>
