	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well nivolumab work treat patient human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV ) -associated T-cell leukemia/lymphoma . Nivolumab antibody , type blood protein tag infect cell harmful agent . Nivolumab work protein call program cell death ( PD ) -1 may help body destroy cancer cell help immune system keep fight cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab Treating Patients With HTLV-Associated T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability nivolumab patient HTLV-associated adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma ( ATLL ) . II . To determine efficacy nivolumab patient HTLV-associated ATLL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect nivolumab HTLV-1 proviral deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) load . II . To determine effect nivolumab anti-HTLV-1 anti-ATLL immune response . III . To determine effect nivolumab HTLV-1 integration site clonality . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60-120 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 46 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
