The dosage regimens ferrous succinate without vitamin C randomly assign patient meet inclusion criterion , patient follow every two week . On one hand , whether addition vitamin C accelerate recovery anemia evaluate , hand , whether addition vitamin C increase incidence gastrointestinal tract discomfort aslo appraise , discomfort include vomit , nausea , abdominal pain , diarrhea constipation .

	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Vitamin C Iron Supplementation Adult IDA Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Iron deficiency ( ID ) cause approximately half anemia case worldwide , moderate degree iron-deficiency anemia ( IDA ) affect approximately 610 million people worldwide 8.8 % population . It slightly common female ( 9.9 % ) male ( 7.8 % ) . In 2013 , anemia due iron deficiency result 183,000 death . IDA urgent problem solve . Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) anemia due enough iron . Anemia define decrease amount red blood cell ( RBCs ) hemoglobin blood . It cause insufficient dietary intake absorption iron , iron loss bleeding . In baby adolescent , rapid growth may outpace dietary intake iron , result deficiency without disease grossly abnormal diet . In woman childbearing age , heavy long menstrual period also cause mild iron-deficiency anemia . Anemia sometimes treatable , certain type anemia may lifelong . If cause dietary iron deficiency , eat iron-rich food , bean , lentil red meat , take iron supplement usually correct anemia . In clinic , IDA clinically divide three stage : ID , iron deficiency erythropoiesis ( iron deficiency erythropoiesis , IDE ) IDA . The first stage reduction iron storage , history inadequate iron absorption ; second stage IDE , addition iron reduction lack external storage , transferrin also reduce , intake iron red blood cell reduce compare normal condition time ; IDA last stage iron deficiency . If patient diagnose ID condition correct diet therapy ; reach IDA criterion , 's need take iron orally improve symptom soon possible , important find cause iron deficiency . Ferrous succinate commonly use treat IDA clinic , mainly absorb duodenum proximal jejunum form ferrous iron . In health people , 5 % 10 % iron absorb take orally . absorption proportion increase 20 % ~30 % IDA patient . After absorb , ferrous iron bind transferrin enter blood circulation , involve production red blood cell raw material . In clinical practice , doctor prescribe ferrous succinate without vitamin C accord preference . Vitamin C Involves many biological process vivo , , collagen formation , tissue repair , synthesis phenylalanine , tyrosine , metabolism folic acid , iron maintains vascular integrity . Researchers show increase iron intake vitamin C prevent anemia , application vitamin C reduce toxicity symptom genotoxic cause ferric iron , demonstrate vitamin C safe combine ferrous succinate . In theory , divalent iron absorb duodenum upper jejunum , vitamin C oxidize ferric iron divalent iron maintain certain degree acidity intestine , promote absorption iron . However , feasibility theory represent clinical practice . So 's necessary explore efficacy safety vitamin C iron supplementation adult IDA patient randomize control trial ( RCT ) . PROCEDURE Before start study , manila envelope use carry random allocation scheme , different treatment option randomly load envelope accord randomization generate Stata 11.0 software . In term inclusion criterion , We write serial number patient envelope sign inform consent form give different treatment accord internal treatment option envelope . In addition treatment , increase intake protein , calcium , iron , vitamins essential fatty acid , appropriate heat also advise time . In order check compliance subject , drug package aluminum cardboard ask return researcher follow-up every two week , patient emphasize return drug package , include pharmaceutical package take run , help researcher analyze patient medication correctly . The number tablet count determine much remain drug drug patient take . During period study , patient participate study allow use drug may affect effect iron supplementation . In special circumstance , patient exclude use drug affect absorption iron vitamin C. The patient receive blood routine examination follow-up every two week , result examination , reason number termination loss , incidence adverse event patient , , nausea , vomit , abdominal pain , diarrhea constipation record . Finally , analyze data determine effect safety vitamin C iron supplementation . In study , hypothesis vitamin C increase absorption iron accelerate recovery anemia , also increase incidence gastrointestinal adverse event increase iron absorption time .</detailed_description>
