	<brief_summary>Shoulder pain among common musculoskeletal complaint , lead high number General Practioners consultation United Kingdom . On top list disorder cause pain dysfunction shoulder rotator cuff tear . The aetiology rotator cuff tear multifactorial likely combination age-related degenerative change trauma life . It present approximately 25 % individual 60 50 % individual 80 show start develop 40 . To recover functional status patient group , surgical repair often recommend , optimal result rehabilitation great importance must adequately plan . After surgery period movement restriction follow , however , optimal time immobilisation unknown . As common practice , patient use sling six week avoid activity affect shoulder . This period important protect tendon , allow good healing possibly prevent re-tear episode . Although , delayed motion may increase risk postoperative shoulder stiffness , muscle atrophy potentially delay improvement functionality . Based available evidence , difficult make clinical decision well-programmed rehabilitation regime establish favourable postoperative time start . Moreover , clear early mobilisation benefit severe stage publish study methodological flaw compromise clinical decision patient high commitment . The question whether early mobilisation application beneficial high importance result help improve patient quality life , also may reduce cost complication may avoid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study randomise control trial , mean participant equal chance assign one 2 group . The first group start rehabilitation 3 week post-surgery second group start 6 week . The rehabilitation stag start passive movement , progress active stage phase full recovery . The whole program last 3 month , accordance normally use Wrightington Hospital . Each participant 4 assessment session : 1 pre-surgery , 3 month post-surgery , 6 month last 12 month post-surgery . The assessment session consist answer questionnaire clinical assessment equipment , measure muscle activity joint angle clinical task . An ultrasound scan shoulder ass integrity rotator cuff would carry one year surgery consultant radiologist . These assessment time routine orthopaedic clinic assessment patient make extra trip take part research .</detailed_description>
