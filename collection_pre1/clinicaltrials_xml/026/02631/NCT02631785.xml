	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorder common form pediatric psychopathology , affect 5 - 20 % child adolescent . Despite therapeutic advance , treatment-resistance remains high , progress towards early detection at-risk population effective treatment stall . Although anxiety disorder transient , recent study suggest pediatric anxiety disorder commonly persist adulthood . Because anxiety disorder costly debilitate condition often associate severe psychopathology substance abuse , depression suicidality , imperative need identify risk resilience factor moderate pediatric anxiety improve treatment . Fear condition resistance extinction two domain implicated etiology maintenance anxiety disorder . Indeed , one effective treatment pediatric adult anxiety disorder , exposure therapy , relies profoundly extinction learn . The propose research plan investigate neural correlate aberrant fear conditioning extinction process child adolescent anxiety disorder . The propose research aim isolate brain-based information-processing mechanism implicate perturbed fear learn extinction characteristic pediatric anxiety . A fMRI study use novel age-appropriate fear conditioning-extinction paradigm propose . The study delineate perturb psychological psychophysiological response fear condition isolate neuro-cognitive mechanism mediate extinction recall anxious non-anxious child . Three week complete fear condition extinction task psychophysiology lab , participant return complete fMRI extinction-recall task quantify response extinguish CS blend . Two major hypothesis examine : ) anxious child exhibit perturbation extinction measure psychophysiology index self-reported fear compare non-anxious child ; b ) less activation ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ) expect anxious , relative healthy , child extinction-recall . Furthermore , study focus therapeutic relevance dysfunction fear learn extinction treatment examine association vmPFC function response exposure intervention anxious child . Lower level vmPFC activation prior exposure therapy large pre-to-post-treatment change vmPFC activity expect associate well response exposure therapy .</detailed_description>
