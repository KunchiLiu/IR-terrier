	<brief_summary>Objective : To compare vNOTES ( vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery ) establish total laparoscopic hysterectomy successful removal non-prolapsed uterus woman due undergo hysterectomy benign gynecological pathology . Study design : Randomized controlled/single center/single-blinded/parallel-group/non-inferiority/efficacy trial . Study population : All woman age 18 70 year regardless parity non-prolapsed uterus benign indication hysterectomy . Randomization : Women randomly allocate undergo one two technique removal uterus immediately surgery use computer generate randomization list . We use stratified randomization accord estimate uterine size clinical examination . Intervention : Women treat surgeon blind treatment allocation equally skilled perform technique . In intervention group vNOTES technique use . Control : In control group surgery do classical laparoscopic technique . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary study outcome parameter : successful removal womb intend approach without conversion alternative approach . Secondary outcome : proportion woman admit in-hospital ward least one night observation , base preference ; postoperative pain score use VAS ( Visual Analogue Scale ) measure day 1 till 7 participate woman follow surgery total amount analgesic use described standardized pain treatment protocol day 1 till 7 ; postoperative infection define low abdominal pain fever &gt; 38Â°C positive clinical sign laboratory finding ; per- postoperative complication accord Clavien- Dindo classification detect first six week surgery ; hospital readmission within 6 week follow surgery ; duration surgical procedure ; incidence intensity dyspareunia record participant baseline , 3 6 month self-reporting use simple questionnaire VAS ( Visual Analogue Scale ) ; sexual wellbeing record participant baseline , 3 6 month SSFS ( Short Sexual Functioning Scale ) ; health-related quality life , baseline , 3 6 month self-reporting EQ-5D-3L questionnaire ; direct indirect cost incur 6 week hysterectomy associated procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives HALON Trial The primary research question IDEAL stage 2b efficacy trial follow : vNOTES ( vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery ) hysterectomy least effective compare standard transabdominal laparoscopic approach ( LSC ) remove non-prolapsed uterus without need conversion alternative approach ? ( non inferiority design ) Secondary research question : - Do woman treat vNOTES prefer leave day care unit day surgery compare LSC ? - Do woman treat vNOTES suffer less pain compare woman treat LSC first postoperative week ? - Is removal uterus vNOTES faster compare LSC ? - Does vNOTES cause pelvic infection complication compare LSC ? - Does vNOTES result hospital readmission within 6 week surgery compare LSC ? - Does vNOTES approach result woman report dyspareunia , less sexual wellbeing less health-related quality life 3 6 month surgery compare woman treat LSC ? - What direct indirect cost 6 week surgical intervention vNOTES compare LSC ? 2 . TRIAL DESIGN 2.1 . Design A single center , single-blinded , parallel group randomize , non-inferiority efficacy trial . 2.2 . Simple pilot randomize trial . 2.3 . Time schedule Based upon mean number hysterectomy perform annually benign gynecological disease department Obstetrics Gynecology participate center ( 168 ) investigator estimate duration recruitment 12 month . Based upon follow ( 6 month ) period analysis/reporting ( 3 month ) total study period 2 year . 2.4 . Participating center Department Obstetrics Gynecology Imeldahospital Imeldalaan 9 2820 Bonheiden Belgium 3 . ELIGIBILITY , CONSENT AND RANDOMIZATION 3.1 . Screening consent prior surgery All woman age 18 70 year , regardless parity , non-prolapsed uterus need hysterectomy benign indication eligible inclusion . 3.2 . Determining eligibility All woman age 18 70 year , regardless parity , non-prolapsed uterus need hysterectomy benign indication provide consent participation eligible HALON trial randomize procedure . 3.3 . Randomization If woman eligible HALON trial , trial secretary obtain randomized allocation day surgery . This do use randomization list generate free computer software program offer Research Randomizer ( http : //www.randomizer.org ) . The random sequence generation conceal use sequentially number opaque seal envelope . The envelope open nurse assistant day surgery practical logistic reason . 3.4 . Patients strong preference treatment A minority woman express clear preference one treatment ( e.g . strong desire scar ) reason wish randomize surgical treatment . To investigate outcome vary choice , woman could follow exactly way woman randomize HALON trial . A formal non-randomized follow-up woman do logistical reason . 3.5 . Stratification randomization A blocked randomization procedure use avoid chance imbalance parameter 'uterine size ' . 4 . TREATMENT ALLOCATIONS 4.1 . Surgical procedures The principal investigator , train experience laparoscopy NOTES , perform surgical procedure . He therefore blind . All vNOTES participant blind three superficial non-therapeutic `` mock '' skin incision similar do laparoscopic technique . 4.1.1 vNOTES hysterectomy This surgical procedure do intervention arm HALON trial . 4.1.2 LSC hysterectomy This surgical procedure do control arm HALON trial . 5 . FOLLOW-UP AND OUTCOME MEASURES 5.1 . Clinical assessment 5.1.1 Format PROMs ( Patient report outcome ) collect use postal questionnaire , include combination disease specific ( Pain sexual intercourse measure VAS scale SSFS Scale ) generic measurement instrument ( EQ-5D ) . The postal questionnaire send HALON Trial Office postage pay envelopes two week due date . Reminders send patient questionnaire return within one week due date attempt make contact patient phone questionnaire return two week due date . 5.1.2 Timing assessment The primary outcome measure clinically end surgical procedure . In addition PROMs take place baseline ( pain sexual intercourse , health-related quality life sexual well ) , even surgical intervention ( in-hospital admission ) , first postoperative week ( pain VAS score analgetic drug ) 3 6 month ( dyspareunia/ sexual well being/health relate quality life ) . Clinical physician assessment take place even surgical intervention ( in-hospital admission ) first six week follow surgery ( pelvic infection , surgical complication , hospital readmission rate ) . 5.2 . Primary clinical outcome measure The proportion woman successfully treat remove uterus intend approach without conversion another approach , use dichotomous outcome measure , use measure efficacy . 5.3 . Secondary clinical outcome measure The following secondary outcome measure : - The proportion woman addmitted in-hospital least one night observation base preference , dichotomous outcome . - Postoperative pain score , ordinal outcome , measure use VAS ( Visual Analogue Scale ) twice daily day 1 till 7 self-reported participate woman . - Postoperative pain define total amount analgesic use described standardized pain treatment protocol , continuous outcome . - Postoperative infection dichotomous outcome . - Per- postoperative complication accord Clavien- Dindo classification detect first six week surgery , dichotomous outcome . - The proportion woman readmitted hospital within 6 week follow surgery . - Incidence intensity dyspareunia record participant baseline , 3 6 month self-reporting use simple questionnaire VAS scale , dichotomous ordinal outcome . - Sexual wellbeing baseline , 3 6 month self-reporting SSFS ( Short Sexual Functioning Scale ) . - Health related quality life , baseline , 3 6 month self-reporting EQ-5D-3L scale . - Duration surgery measure time minute insertion bladder catheter end vaginal/abdominal wound closure , continuous outcome . 5.4.The direct indirect cost 6 week hysterectomy vNOTES technique compare LSC . 6 . ACCRUAL AND ANALYSIS 6.1 . Sample size The sample size primary outcome trial choose give good statistical power preclude clinically important inferiority vNOTES compare laparoscopy base evidence retrieve Dutch prospective cohort study . Based power calculation primary outcome assume loss-to-follow-up rate 15 % decide include 66 study participant HALON trial . 6.2 . Projected accrual attrition rate Based upon mean number hysterectomy perform annually department Obstetrics Gynecology participate center ( 168 ) investigator anticipate duration recruitment 12 month . Based upon follow ( 6 month ) period analysis/reporting ( 3 month ) total study period 2 year . First publication possible within four year trial commencement . The sample size calculation allow 15 % loss follow rate . In order minimize rate attrition dedicate research secretary amployed optimize recruitment follow .</detailed_description>
