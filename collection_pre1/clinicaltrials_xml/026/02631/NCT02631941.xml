	<brief_summary>The pharmacokinetics study aim evaluate safety Z7200 ( budesonide/formoterol ) comparison Symbicort Turbohaler ( budesonide/formoterol ) , assess bioequivalence two product . Namely study compare total systemic bioavailability ( indicator safety ) , compare pulmonary bioavailability ( possible surrogate indicator efficacy ) . This study perform healthy subject .</brief_summary>
