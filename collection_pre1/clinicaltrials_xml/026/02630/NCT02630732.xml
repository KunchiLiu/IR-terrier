	<brief_summary>The primary scientific objective study entail examine whether perioperative pain neuroscience education ( PPNE 'brain school ' ) effective classical back school reduce pain improve pain inhibition patient undergo surgery spinal radiculopathy . A secondary objective implies examine whether PPNE effective classical back school impart behavioural change ( i.e . decrease postoperative healthcare expenditure lumbar radiculopathy ) , improve function daily life improve surgical experience ( =better prepare surgery , surgery meeting expectation ) patient undergo surgery spinal radiculopathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior study lumbar radiculopathy patient , propose CPM protocol EEG record pre-tested group twenty healthy subject , fully inform study subsequently give consent participate . The proof concept set evaluate effectiveness protocol , specifically appearance nociceptive evoke potential induce electrical stimulation load subject , well safety protocol . Low back pain frequently report problem community . In absence successful outcomes follow conservative intervention , surgery ( include lumbar discectomy ) recommend , evidence-based treatment lumbar radiculopathy . To prevent chronicity follow spinal surgery , preoperative education seem warrant . Current preoperative education program orthopaedic neurosurgical domain typically rely biomedical model , include education ( spinal ) anatomy biomechanics ( like do 'back school ' ) , well detail surgical procedure . Preoperative education focus biomedical model ineffective , increase anxiety fear patient undergo spinal surgery . Therefore , need reconsider content education provide patient undergoing spinal surgery . Patient recruitment . All patient schedule surgery lumbar radiculopathy UZ Brussel invite participate . Lumbar radiculopathy define pain due lumbosacral nerve root compression . The NICE guideline describe unilateral leg pain worse current back pain . This pain radiate foot toe , go together numbness paraesthesia distribution , associate motor neurological deficit . Patients undergo surgery lumbar radiculopathy ( n â‰¥ 100 ) , willing participate ( include willingness comply predetermine follow-up ) , recruit . Randomization concealment Randomization do computer-generated randomization list . A list patient number group allocation result randomization procedure store seal envelope . All assessment perform two investigator . Intervention . At least 50 patient undergoing surgery lumbar radiculopathy get experimental treatment , i.e . perioperative pain neuroscience education ( PPNE ) . All patient receive usual care plus surgery lumbar radiculopathy . PPNE comprise two treatment session deliver one physiotherapist ( verbal one-on-one ) educational booklet . The first treatment session week surgery , second day 2 follow surgery . Each treatment session last approximately 60 minute . Patients receive pain neuroscience education extensive possibility ask question session . At end first educational session , patient receive educational booklet neurophysiology pain ask read carefully follow surgery . In addition , ask complete interactive part book second session . The second educational session ( postoperative ) highly individually-tailored readdress patient 's illness perception , answer question discuss way apply knowledge patient 's daily life . Immediately second educational session participant ask complete Neurophysiology Pain Test . Control intervention . At least 50 patient undergo control treatment . As case patient experimental group , patient control group receive usual care plus surgery lumbar radiculopathy . In addition standard treatment receive patient include study , receive back school . The amount therapist-patient contact , number treatment session well mode administration identical treatment group . The procedure control treatment identical experimental treatment , apart content treatment , base clinical guideline several study . The education cover normal course back pain . Data collection . All assessment perform UZ Brussel . Baseline assessment take place week prior surgery . Immediate treatment effect assess post-operative day 3 . Short-term intermediate follow-up assessment take place , respectively , 6 week 6 month post-surgery . Twelve 24 month surgery long-term follow-up treatment effect investigate . Statistical analysis . At baseline , correlation analysis perform order examine possible association preoperative endogenous analgesia psychological factor . All postoperative data analysis base Intention-to-Treat principle ( i.e . baseline observation carry forward method ) . AN ( C ) OVA repeat measure analysis use evaluate compare treatment effect . Baseline data outcome measure interest , age gender serve covariates . Statistical , well clinical significant difference define effect size determine . In addition , number need treat calculate . Again , correlation analysis perform evaluate whether change outcome measure relate change psychological factor .</detailed_description>
