	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate physiologic response quinine-saline irrigation acute exacerbation uncomplicated chronic rhinosinusitis follow endoscopic sinus surgery . Subjects previously functional endoscopic sinus surgery acute exacerbation chronic rhinosinusitis randomize either quinine-saline saline-placebo arm . The investigator measure baseline follow-up clinical quality-of-life outcome arm , compare group end study period . The investigator ' hypothesis participant quinine sulfate arm perform well measure compare control arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall Objectives : To evaluate physiological difference quinine-saline irrigation vs. saline-placebo irrigation acute exacerbation uncomplicated chronic rhinosinusitis follow endoscopic sinus surgery . A secondary objective determine use quinine efficacious alternative therapy treat bacterial rhinosinusitis . Background : Sinusitis common disorder accounting estimate 13 million physician office visit United States year . The aggregated cost sinusitis approximately $ 8 billion annually , affect estimate 16 % population United States . Despite multiple attempted treatment , include estimate 550,000 surgery per year , disease continue major health problem , expenditures poor quality life . Recent analysis data National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 2006 2010 show rhinosinusitis account outpatient antibiotic prescription adult diagnosis . Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) represent considerable subset population account significant portion expenditure vast majority surgery . It define sign symptom sinusitis last 12 week . Unlike organisms responsible acute rhinosinusitis , difficult treat bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Staphylococcus aureus Stenotrophomonas multiformia often offend pathogen CRS . Their prevalence increase patient already sinus surgery continue get recur sinus infection . Staph aureus gram-negative organism show account roughly 60 % infection patient previously undergone endoscopic sinus surgery . Due increase drug resistance well potential biofilm formation , increase pressure patient clinician alike develop alternative treatment systemic antibiotic . One commonly used alternative patient previous sinus surgery topical saline irrigation without topical preparation . Topical irrigation much great paranasal sinus penetration post surgical patient . Commonly use topical preparation include : saline alone saline mixed mupirocin , gentamicin , tobramycin , ceftazadine , betadine , manuka honey , baby shampoo , budesonide mometasone . The investigator recently identify novel arm upper airway innate immunity mediate bitter taste receptor . When subset airway bitter taste receptor activate stimulate respiratory epithelium generate nitric oxide , important component sinus innate immunity increase mucociliary clearance well diffuse mucus bactericidal . A topical therapy activate taste receptor may help sinus clear infection natural innate defense mechanism . While investigator identify multiple bitter compound stimulate response , quinine pique interest activate multiple bitter taste receptor already use human nose .</detailed_description>
