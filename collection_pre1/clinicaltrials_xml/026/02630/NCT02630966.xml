	<brief_title>Vedolizumab IV 300 mg Treatment Fistulizing Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call vedolizumab IV . Vedolizumab IV test treat people fistulizing CD . This study look fistula heal people take vedolizumab IV . The study enroll approximately 126 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Group 1 : Vedolizumab IV 300 mg dose Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 , 14 22 , placebo infusion Week 10 ( dummy inactive infusion - solution look like study drug active ingredient ) . - Group 2 : Vedolizumab IV 300 mg dose Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 22 . This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study screen 18 week last dose 44 week . Participants make multiple visit clinic , contact telephone 6 month last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
