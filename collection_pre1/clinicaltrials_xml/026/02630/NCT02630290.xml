	<detailed_description>Dexmedetomidine , alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist , find exerts excellent influence file perineural block . It could shorten onset time prolong duration nerve block improve postoperative pain . However , Dexmedetomidine-induced bradycardia hypotension recently attract considerable attention potentially grave consequence , include sinus arrest refractory cardiogenic shock . Although meta-analysis show perineural dexmedetomidine local anaesthetic adjuvant neuraxial peripheral nerve block produce reversible bradycardia 7 % brachial plexus block patient effect incidence hypotension , various clinical study report significant decrease heart rate . A low dose may help minimize cardiovascular risk associate dexmedetomidine . However , study address clinical effect low-dose dexmedetomidine perineural adjuvant . The present study design test hypothesis low-dose dexmedetomidine , till today report literature , add ropivacaine brachial plexus block would safely enhance duration analgesia without adverse effect compare ropivacaine alone . Investigators conduct single-center , prospective , randomize , triple-blind , controlled trial patient undergo elective forearm hand surgery ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block use either 20 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine 0.5 % ropivacaine plus 30 microg dexmedetomidine . The primary outcome self-reported duration analgesia . Secondary outcome include onset time duration motor sensory block , total postoperative analgesic , safety assessment ( adverse effect include cardiovascular inhibition postoperative abnormal sensation ) .
