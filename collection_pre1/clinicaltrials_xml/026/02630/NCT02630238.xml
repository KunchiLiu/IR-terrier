	<detailed_description>This double blind placebo study take place 8 week treatment period diet exercise . All participant ( n=16 ) place hypocaloric diet exercise program . Both group exercise time . Baseline habitual 3 day food log , waist hip ratio BodPod measure body fat &amp; lean mass ( percentage &amp; absolute value ) take participant . Each provide macronutrient guideline follow ( 40 % carbohydrate , 30 % protein , 30 % fat ) &amp; place daily energy deficit 500 calorie 8 week study period . Participants treatment control group ask record dietary intake use MyFitnessPal smartphone application website order insure compliance prescribe diet . MyFitnessPal fast easy use calorie counter Windows phone . Further , large food database calorie counter apps ( 3,000,000 food ) . Each individual provide investigator weekly screen shot mean data . Exercise take place class base , circuit training set run certify personal trainer ( Alicia MacDougall ) . Exercise safety assess Physical Readiness Questionnaire ( Par- Q You - see appendix ) . Further , important note woman overweight , obese , research evidence indicate clearly inactivity far hazardous one 's health regular exercise ( American College Sports Medicine ) . Attendance record document adherence . This style training choose order combine strength endurance base training attempt generate fat loss keep workout control study investigator . Participants match pair base body fat % assigned test group &amp; placebo group . This ensure group similar mean SD fat mass baseline . The placebo group follow diet exercise regime describe plus , give isoenergetic placebo take daily . The placebo form powder isoenergetic beverage carbohydrate instead amino acid , similar taste &amp; appearance powder BCAA supplement test group receive order keep participant blind treatment . Specifically , test group 0.342g/kg BCAA per day , partially account diet rest provide BCAA supplement ( NOW BCAA Powder ) . The supplement provide 2:1:1 ratio leucine , isoleucine , &amp; valine respectively . At 4 8 week treatment , participant remeasured waist hip ratio BodPod measure body fat &amp; lean mass . These value compare baseline value study group order determine increase BCAA intake prove effective . The beverage powder ( treatment &amp; placebo ) distribute zip lock plastic bag participant third party ( graduate student ) involve study thereby keep investigator blind .</detailed_description>
