	<brief_summary>Cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) particular T cell play critical role rejection transplant organ . Thus , transplant recipient life-long individualized immunosuppressive medication require avoid graft rejection . However , weak suppression CMI cause acute chronic graft damage lead transplant loss , whereas potent suppression CMI support opportunistic infection reactivation persistent virus . One big challenge field transplantation provide personalize immunosuppressive antiviral therapy base reliable assessment monitoring CMI . This could lead reduction graft rejection virus reactivations transplant recipient . With development assay T-Track® CMV T-Track® EBV , Lophius Biosciences GmbH implement novel proprietary T-activation technology improve assessment functionality CMI cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) - and/or Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -seropositive individual . In contrast exist system Lophius assay open opportunity characterize functionality CMI entire network . The planned clinical multicenter study aim verify suitability two assay reliable assessment functionality CMI . Hemodialysis patient identify appropriate patient cohort investigate clinical sensitivity Lophius assay patient closely resemble kidney transplant recipient prior immunosuppressive therapy . The determination functional CMI course immunosuppressive treatment may future enable physician optimize individual immunosuppressive antiviral therapy transplant recipient reduce risk rejection well virus reactivations associate disease .</brief_summary>
