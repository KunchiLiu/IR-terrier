	<brief_title>Immediate Verses Delayed Surgical Periodontal Therapy After Endodontic Treatment Endo Perio Lesion With Communication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observations base upon review article case report suggest , root canal system infect , endodontic treatment commence prior periodontal therapy order remove intra canal infection cementum remove case concurrent endodontic-periodontic lesion without communication . This avoids several complication provide favourable environment periodontal repair . Treatment result endodontic therapy evaluate 2-3 month periodontal treatment consider . But review article state teeth concurrent endodontic periodontal disease communicate require comprehensive treatment endodontic periodontal management . Ideally infection remove root canal fill final restoration provide . Completion root canal filling delay periodontal prognosis reassess determine follow initial , often , periodontal treatment . Though Infected root canal system periodontal pocket similar microbiological flora , microbes specie spirochetes periodontal pocket infect root canal system , microflora infected root canal teeth concurrent endodontic periodontal disease complex teeth infection confine periapical region . So outcome endodontic treatment may affect root canal filling place still periodontal infection present communicates root canal system since cross-seeding apical lateral foramen possible . An In-vitro study human extract teeth state despite thorough cleaning disinfection root canal system endodontic treatment , bacteria periodontal lesion may re-invade root canal system since root canal filling seal canal completely . All finding base microbiological , histological , case-reports , retrospective in-vitro studies.The timing periodontal treatment concurrent endodontic -periodontal lesion communication still remain issue debate.No prospective human clinical trial ( randomize ) conduct till date ascertain whether surgical periodontal treatment give immediately completion non-surgical endodontic treatment 2-3 month completion non-surgical endodontic treatment . Thus aim study conduct prospective randomize clinical trial evaluate effect immediate delay surgical periodontal therapy non-surgical endodontic treatment management concurrent endodontic -periodontal lesion communication . MATERIAL AND METHOD This randomize clinical trial conduct Department Periodontics Oral Implantology collaboration Department Conservative Dentistry Endodontics , Post Graduate Institute Dental Sciences , Rohtak . STUDY POPULATION Patients recruit regular patient department department periodontics oral implantology , department conservative dentistry endodontics department oral medicine , diagnosis radiology . The study conduct follow : - 1 . Immediate surgery group Treatment involve surgical periodontal therapy form open flap debridement immediately non-surgical endodontic treatment . 2 . Delayed surgery group Treatment involve surgical periodontal therapy form open flap debridement 3 month completion non-surgical endodontic treatment . INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients age 18 year clinical radiographic diagnosis combine endodontic periodontal lesion generalize chronic periodontitis least one non vital tooth apical radiolucency communication . - Wide base pocket , deep pocket depth - Non vital tooth ( confirm heat test , cold test electronic pulp test ) - Radiographic periapical alveolar bone destruction apical communication - Patients generalize chronic periodontitis [ ≥2 interproximal site clinical attachment level ( CAL ) ≥ 4mm , tooth ( moderate ) ≥2 interproximal site clinical attachment level ( CAL ) ≥6mm , tooth ( severe ) ] 26 EXCLUSION CRITERIA - Systemic illness know affect periodontium outcome periodontal therapy . - Patient take medication corticosteroid calcium channel blocker , know interfere periodontal wound heal patient long term NSAID therapy . - Patients allergic medication ( local anaesthetic , antibiotic , NSAID ) . - Pregnant lactating mother . - Smokers tobacco chewer . - Grade 3 mobile teeth . - Unrestorable tooth . - Fractured/perforated root . - Developing permanent tooth . - Previously root canal fill . - History recent periodontal treatment within 6 month prior study . Prior inform consent take patient explain procedure patient 's language along risk benefit involve . METHODOLOGY Patients randomly allocate group1 group 2 . The study conduct follow : - 1 . Presurgical therapy : - include - Oral hygiene instruction - Full mouth supragingival subgingival scale root planning ultrasonic scaler , hand scaler curette . - Conventional root canal therapy initiate group definite periodontal surgical therapy . 2 . Surgical therapy : - In group 1 periodontal surgical procedure form open flap debridement perform immediately obturation root canal system In group 2 periodontal surgical procedure form open flap debridement perform 3 month obturation root canal system Prior surgery , probe stent fabricate every patient , relative attachment loss measure . CLINICAL PARAMETERS 1 . Full mouth index record baseline - Bleeding probe - Probing Pocket depth - Attachment loss 2 . Site specific index - Plaque index - Gingival index - Relative Probing Pocket depth - Relative attachment loss - Bleeding probe - Tooth mobility - Relative gingival marginal level Using periodontal probe 6 site ( mesial , distal , median point buccal lingual aspect ) per tooth . Customized bite block parallel angle technique use obtain radiographs Clinical parameter record baseline , 3 month 6 month Group 1 ( immediate surgery ) Clinical parameter record baseline , 3 month , 6 month 9 month Group 2 ( delay surgery ) PERIODONTAL PROCEDURE This involve supragingival subgingival scale root planning perform ultrasonic scaler , hand scaler curette complete minimum two session . CONVENTIONAL ENDODONTIC PROCEDURE After achieve local anaesthesia , access opening make help round bur . Then root canal thoroughly debrided follow copious irrigation subsequently prepare help endo file . After preparation canal , calcium hydroxide intracanal medicament place help 27 gauge endodontic syringe 10 day access cavity seal suitable sealer . Obturation perform gutta percha zinc oxide eugenol base sealer . PERIODONTAL SURGICAL PROCEDURE After administration local anaesthesia , buccal lingual/palatal intracrevicular incision make mucoperiosteal flap reflect include atleast one tooth ahead another behind tooth . Meticulous defect debridement root planning carry use area specific curettes scaler special effort remove granulation tissue . After instrumentation , root surface wash saline solution attempt remove remain detached fragment defect surgical field . After debridement mucoperiosteal flap reposition secure use 3-0 non-absorbable black silk surgical suture . The surgical area protect covered periodontal dress post operative instruction give . Processing Data Data record processed standard statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
