	<brief_summary>Due high expression PD-L1 endometrial cancer well ovarian cancer molecularly similar uterine serous cancer , use pembrolizumab beneficial patient population . Since investigator able get pre-treatment research- relate endometrial biopsy well surgical specimen post two cycle pembrolizumab , investigator able evaluate mechanism action drug endometrial cancer tumor environment .</brief_summary>

Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . FIGO grade 1 2 endometrioid cancer . Radiographic image demonstrate uterine cancer probably stage I II . Prior treatment endometrial cancer . Prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior first dose MK3475 recover ( i.e. , ≤ grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior first dose MK3475 recover ( i.e. , ≤ grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note , subject ≤ grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note , subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Received live vaccine within 30 day prior first dose MK3475 . A history malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection . Known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least 4 week prior first dose MK3475 neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . Diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose MK3475 . Currently receive investigational agent participate study investigational agent use investigational device within 4 week first dose MK3475 . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition MK3475 agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection require systemic therapy , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , immunosuppression , autoimmune condition , underlie pulmonary disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid , immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Patient must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour study entry .
