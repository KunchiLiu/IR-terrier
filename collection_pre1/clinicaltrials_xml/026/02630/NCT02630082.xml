	<detailed_description>The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may control development utilization safe effective vaccine prevent HIV infection . To fill gap understand HIV vaccine , study mucosal immunity aim complement assessment systemic immunity . Yet unclear , important understand , mucosal collection kinetics immune activation might initiate may impact peripheral blood endpoint HIV vaccine trial . The HIV Vaccine Trials Network ( HVTN ) National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) conduct single-site , exploratory cohort study evaluate feasibility sample mucosa assess cellular immune response sexually active men sex men , population later-phase HIV vaccine clinical trial often conduct . The primary purpose HVTN 914 ass feasibility perform safe tolerable circumcision rectosigmoid biopsy study study population 30 healthy , HIV-seronegative , uncircumcised men Lima , Peru , age 21 30 year , sex men high risk acquisition HIV ; assess institutional capacity process mucosal sample ; identify method evaluate foreskin rectosigmoid mucosal immune response provide minimal variability analysis small sample size . The study design mimic HIV vaccine study mucosal collection protocol . Participants agree elective sigmoidoscopy biopsy collection circumcision , actively participate study approximately 7 month . The primary analysis focus pre- post-procedure retention , safety laboratory value , sexual satisfaction , HIV risk behavior , level activation marker associate vulnerability HIV infection sample peripheral blood mononuclear cell . A total 11 study visit ( include screen visit ) occur Weeks 0-5 , 10 , 26-28 . Study procedure include physical exam , blood urine collection , HIV testing , questionnaire . Elective rectosigmoid bioscopy perform Weeks 2 27 . Elective circumcision perform Week 4 . Some blood collect participant store used future research . Risk-reduction counseling conduct study visit .</detailed_description>
