	<brief_summary>This proposal investigate pain modulatory mechanism brain functional structural characteristic use multiple MRI modality persistent dentoalveolar pain disorder ( PDAP ) patient without temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) . All measure patient compare painfree control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multimodal Assessment Sensory Processing Brain Features Patients With Chronic Orofacial Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic orofacial pain disorder may present localized mouth persistent dentoalveolar pain disorder ( PDAP ) widespread head/face/jaw temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) . PDAP pain manifest tooth usually underwent root canal treatment site formally occupy tooth , TMD pain usually report preauricular area , jaw temple . These commonly comorbid disorder significant impact individual society . Their mechanism poorly understood evidence suggest deficient pain modulation abnormal brain feature . PDAP TMD patient , compare control , abnormal sensory/pain processing well brain structural functional difference . This proposal investigate pain modulatory mechanism brain functional structural characteristic use multiple MRI modality PDAP patient without TMD . All measure patient compare painfree control . This knowledge support well understanding mechanism involve PDAP support development mechanistic-based clinical treatment patient investigator serve . Findings investigation likely contribute understand chronic pain condition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age handednessmatched painfree control use frequency match maintain similar group average : No selfreport persistent pain condition last 6 month ; No diagnosis PDAP TMD ; 2 . PDAP : Fulfilling diagnostic criterion per Nixdorf et al. , 20122 Characteristic dentoalveolar PDAP pain increase pressure provocation jaw muscle trigger point ( referred pain ) 3 . PDAP TMD : Fulfilling diagnostic criterion PDAP2 chronic TMD myalgia per Schiffman et al . 20143 Selfreport : 1 . Chronic widespread pain 2 . Current use opioids pain medication ( e.g. , ibuprofen/acetaminophen ) stop &lt; 3 day prior test 3 . Conditions/diseases associate altered pain perception : neurological ( e.g. , multiple sclerosis , trigeminal neuralgia ) psychiatric disorder , diabetes , neoplasm cardiovascular disorder 4 . Injury hand 5 . Substance abuse 6 . MRI contraindication include pregnancy</criteria>
