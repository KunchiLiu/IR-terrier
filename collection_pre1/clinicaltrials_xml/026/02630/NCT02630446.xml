	<brief_title>An In-home Respite Care Program Support Informal Caregivers People With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The in-home respite intervention group receive in-home respite care also call `` Baluchonnage '' . During period , last least five day ( 24/24hours ) , internally train experienced care worker person dementia take caregiving task caregiver take break . This care worker also write his/her observation diary . The content diary enables caregiver validate perception , provide strategy deal difficult situation , let feel somebody truly understand daily challenge . The control group receive usual care ( standard dementia care ) . Participants in-home respite intervention group recruit Baluchon staff ask first new period in-home respite care . First , Baluchon staff describe study dyads ask preparedness participate . When give verbal consent contact information forward research team contact phone . During call home visit plan sign inform consent complete baseline assessment . Participants control group recruit several general practitioner spread different region Belgium . Potentially , later phase , control group participant also recruit via Memory Clinics Belgium . Similar recruitment intervention group , physician give information study . When verbal consent participate give physician , caregiver contact phone research team check eligibility . This do listing different support strategy ( include `` Baluchonnage '' ) ask caregiver would interest receive type support . Also previous use Baluchonnage question allow control group . When caregiver appear eligible research team plan home visit sign inform consent complete baseline assessment . Data collection caregiver care-recipient characteristic research outcomes gather several assessment moment . The baseline assessment conduct home visit member research team . Background characteristic baseline value research outcomes gather assessment . For intervention group week precede respite period . For control group take place inclusion . A second assessment do intervention group two week intervention . A third assessment moment do 6 month inclusion last follow assessment conduct 12 month . To fulfill assessment baseline assessment , caregiver contact telephone . All questionnaire available Dutch French use Belgium . When valid translation certain questionnaire exist Dutch French Belgium back-forward translation method perform . For caregiver researcher obtain follow background characteristic : age , gender , region , marital status , ethnicity , educational level , relationship care-recipient , employment status , live situation time spend caregiving . In study group reason ( potential ) use respite ask . Earlier use Baluchonnage also question intervention group participant . Time spent caregiving ( measure twice ) calculate use RUD instrument ( Resource Utilization Dementia ) . For care-recipient follow background characteristic collect baseline : age , gender , marital status , ethnicity , region , National Registration Number , educational level , wait list long-term nursing home placement , dementia-specific medication use , severity dementia . The National Registration Number person dementia gather . This allow u trace study participant IMA database ( Intermutualistisch Agentschap ) gather information resource use date placement nursing home long time period trial . ADL ( Activities Daily Living ) functioning measure use Belgian Katz scale severity dementia Global Deterioration Scale . Both measure twice ( baseline 6 month ) . Sample size calculation perform use SPSS SamplePower 3® . First , literature search determine need effect size standard deviation ( SD ) allow distinguish statistical significant clinical relevant difference primary outcome , i.e . burden . Based finding similar high quality intervention study effect size 0.4 use analysis , implies difference six point ZBI scale ( Zarit Burden Interview ) , SD 15 . Also , average drop-out rate 20 % take account , power 80 % significance level 0.05 . Based value total 124 caregiver/care-recipient dyad need intervention group . To reduce selection-bias inherent quasi-experimental study allocation ratio 1:2 use allow match technique . As result 248 caregiver/care-recipient dyad need control group . When appropriate , i.e . intervention demonstrate effect study endpoint , within-trial model cost-effectiveness analysis conduct separate economic evaluation plan . First analysis perform perspective health care payer take account direct health care cost government 's health care budget ( RIZIV/INAMI ) well patient ' co-payment . Assuming policy maker would consider reimbursement in-home respite future daily cost Baluchonnage thus include analysis . Alongside cost Baluchonnage cost healthcare resource use include hospital community care include . Additionally , also full societal viewpoint undertaken include potential health care cost health care budget patient , also direct indirect cost caregiver patient . Because viewpoint everyone affect intervention consider , caregiver time cost ( i.e . time spent caregiving productivity loss ) well resource use cost sector ( f.e . food delivery ) include . Based KCE ( Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center ) guideline health economic evaluation Belgium future cost discount 3 % future QALY 's 1.5 % . Health utility QALY 's caregiver intervention arm derive Belgian public preference list base score EQ-5D ( general utility instrument ) . Decision analytic modeling carry extrapolate effect intervention find trial long time horizon . The model base result trial well exist data literature . Assumptions , hypotheses source information represent transparent clear way . Finally , model validate expert . Data resource use care-recipient study group obtain adapt version RUD instrument baseline six month inclusion . This RUD instrument attempt include resource use include : health care resource use contain hospital resource ( in-patient out-patient attendance , … ) community care resource ( general practitioner visit , nurse visit , … ) , caregiver patient resource ( time spend caregiver , … ) , resource use sector ( social worker visit , home help visit , … ) . Duration frequency use service multiply unit cost corresponding service . These unit cost obtain Belgian Reimbursement scheme use standard fee regularly insured patient publicly available source . Time spent caregiving calculate baseline six month use recall method also part RUD instrument utilized . Next , amount time spend caregiving monetize use opportunity cost method estimate value lose informal caregiver benefit due spending time provide informal care . For informal caregiver active labor market wage rate similar people impute . Basically , productivity loss include give average high age informal caregiver expect productivity loss negligible impact cost retire . Nevertheless , base result mean age employment status include caregiver researcher decide whether include productivity loss cost . The cost intervention obtain current unit cost per day Baluchonnage multiply amount day in-home respite care deliver . Currently daily cost Baluchonnage set 350€/day covered charity 65€/day direct cost patient . Additional cost fix daily tariff Baluchonnage also include : travel expense respite period pet ( 5€ extra per day ) . Additionally , willingness pay one day in-home respite care Baluchon obtain study group use contingent valuation method ( CVM ) . This method define state preference method elicit monetary value health care program . In trial close response format use . Finally , use decision analytic model , cost nurse home placement derive average daily cost stay nursing home Belgium time complete secondary endpoint . Descriptive statistic represent draw clear profile characteristic study participant . Therefore mean , percentages standard deviation continuous variable display . To determine possible baseline difference group , mean value baseline characteristic compare use independent sample t-tests continuous variable normally distribute perform Pearson 's chi-square test categorical variable . To help control bias confound statistical technique propensity score matching use . Propensity score match see tool simulate RCT setting . In way observed effect consider unbiased estimate real effect . To investigate possible effect intervention primary secondary outcome , analysis variance conduct outcome variable normally distribute . A P-value 0.05 consider significant . All analysis base intention treat also take drop-outs account avoid overestimation respite care effect . When intervention effective cost-effectiveness analysis separate economic evaluation plan perform . Also ICERs ( Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio ) calculate mean upper low confidence level cost consequence . To explore uncertainty one-way-sensitivity analysis conduct around ICER illustrate Tornado diagram . Additionally , input variable probabilistic sensitivity analysis , also call Monte Carlo analysis , conduct test robustness model . These result also illustrate . Finally , result willingness pay threshold Belgian Health Care System present cost-effectiveness acceptability curve . To compare time nursing home placement person use respite care n't , researcher use Kaplan-Meier survival curve illustrate association comparison group . By additionally conduct log-rank test statistical difference group time placement find .</detailed_description>
