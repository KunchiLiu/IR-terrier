	<brief_title>Early Viscosupplementation After ACL Reconstruction : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Viscosupplementation injective approach use orthopaedic practice manage chondropathy osteoarthritis ( OA ) different joint . In last decade , several product develop biomedical industry , different biochemical physical property , aim provide best long-lasting beneficial effect OA patient . The rational supporting use viscosupplementation due biomechanical biological action . First , hyaluronic acid ( HA ) exert lubricant effect improve rheological property synovial fluid thus reduce mechanical stress within joint responsible activation nociceptors cartilage surface wear . Furthermore , HA bind cellular receptor stimulate endogenous production hyaluronan , extracellular matrix component , also counteract inflammatory molecule protease overexpressed diseased joint . In light feature , HA could consider `` intra-articular drug '' act pain killer joint regulator agent . These property could theoretically exploit also different clinical application chronic disease like OA . In particular , viscosupplementation might play beneficial role restore overall joint homeostasis might contribute reduce pro-inflammatory stimulus knee surgical procedure , thus reduce pain accelerate functional recovery . Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction one common procedure field sport medicine . It common patient experience persistent knee swell surgical procedure , increase pain delay start rehabilitation program , thus prolong time full functional recovery . The possibility use intra-articular agent HA reduce post-operative inflammatory stress knee , limit use pain-killers promote faster recovery ACL reconstruction , seem therefore attractive . The aim present double blind , placebo control randomize study evaluate effect , term pain control functional recovery , provide single HA injection perform early postoperative phase ACL reconstruction . The day ACL reconstruction ( perform technique subject enrol ) , patient randomize receive single injection HA 3 ml saline solution . The randomization list keep dedicated office inject physician contact office know treatment allocation injection , perform lateral parapatellar approach , remove drainage attempt aspiration evacuate eventual residual blood joint . In order maintain patient blind treatment , surgical drape place prevent see injective procedure . All patient evaluate 15 , 30 , 60 , 180 360 day surgery use follow tool : SF-36 , IKDC subjective , VAS pain , EQ-VAS general Health Status Tegner score . Also trans-patellar circumference active passive ROM knee register follow-up evaluation .</detailed_description>
