	<detailed_description>Rationale : Tinnitus perception sound noise absence external physical source . It highly prevalent condition high percentage patient , satisfy treatment modality . For people , tinnitus severe impact quality life , lead incapacity work sometimes even suicidality . The auditory brainstem implant ( ABI ) implant indicated restoration hear patient hypo- , aplasia cochlear nerve dysfunction nerve cause tumor growth neurofibromatosis type II . It show standard intend effect ABI reduction tinnitus welcome side effect 66 % case . This analogy promise effect cochlear implant ( CI ) treatment patient unilateral tinnitus . In study , effect ABI severely invalidate , unilateral , intractable tinnitus investigate . The ABI may advantage CI tinnitus treatment , CI-implantation lead destruction inner ear structure , lead profound deafness , ABI presume damage anatomical structure . This first study implant ABI primary aim tinnitus reduction . Objective . To evaluate efficacy ABI suppression unilateral , intractable tinnitus establish safety ABI new indication . Study design . This single center , non-randomized , prospective cohort , intervention pilot study . There control group . In study , 10 patient implanted ABI . Study population . Adult patient invalidate , unilateral , intractable tinnitus ipsilateral severe hearing loss include study . All study participant significant comorbidity mentally competent . Intervention . All study participant receive ABI , neurosurgically implant . The ABI switch 6 week implantation . The surgery post-surgery follow-up switch-on procedure consistent intend use ABI . Main study parameter . The primary outcome change Tinnitus Functioning Index ( TFI ) . The endpoint set 1 year implantation . Follow take place 5 year implantation . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness . The implantation , activation fit ABI perform exactly describe exist protocol intend use , however study , ABI place another indication . Implantation ABI require hospital admission estimate 4 day . After dismissal , patient visit outpatient clinic least 8 time first year , depend amount fit session necessary . Implantation ABI invasive procedure , potentially cause severe complication ( meningitis 3,8 % , transient hydrocephalus 1,3 % , cerebellar contusion 1,2 % ) . Other complication may occur infection , bleeding , hear loss cranial nerve dysfunction . By extensive training program neurosurgeon presence experience surgeon first surgical procedure , investigator feel neurosurgical risk risk device failure due inadequate implantation limit . In pilot study , effect hear tinnitus still uncertain , however base result published literature investigator confident effect positive . Nonauditory side-effects disappointing result hear and/or tinnitus well manage alter stimulation strategy necessary , turn device . Tinnitus severely invalidate large impact quality life ABI promise reduce tinnitus patient . This study impose significant risk study participant . However , investigator feel risk outweigh potential ameliorate severely debilitate tinnitus .</detailed_description>
