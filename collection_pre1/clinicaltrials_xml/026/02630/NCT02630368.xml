	<detailed_description>For phase I study , prospective open-label phase I trial base dose escalate study design assess two dose level JX-594 associated metronomic cyclophosphamide . For phase II study , stratum soft-tissue sarcoma , monocenter , randomize non comparative phase II clinical trial . This phase II trial base optimal 2-stage Simon 's design . Randomization 2:1 2 patient randomized experimental arm n°1 ( association metronomic cyclophosphamide JX-594 ) 1 patient randomize control arm n°2 ( treatment metronomic cyclophosphamide alone ) . For phase II study , stratum breast cancer , monocenter , one-arm phase II clinical trial , base two-stage optimal Simon 's design ( association metronomic cyclophosphamide JX-594 ) .</detailed_description>
