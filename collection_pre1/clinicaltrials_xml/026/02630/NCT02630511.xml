	<brief_summary>Although asthma disease airway , research show asthmatic likely develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) compare non-asthmatics . Vascular dysfunction see people high risk CVD link inflammation . During asthma attack , level inflammation whole body increase , could potentially explain asthmatic increase risk CVD . By exercise , people change amount inflammation body , improve vascular function , thereby reduce risk CVD . In proposed study investigator assess asthma attack lead increase risk CVD evaluate inflammatory level vascular function asthma attack . The investigator also evaluate exercise reduces cardiovascular risk follow asthma attack . The result study help understand asthmatic increase risk CVD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND &amp; SCOPE : While asthma generally consider disease airway , important systemic consequence predispose people asthma become likely die cardiovascular ( CV ) disease compare non-asthmatics . Additional CV risk report people severe asthma , relationship reduction lung function cardiac death . To date , little known regard interaction asthma exacerbation CV risk . Brachial flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) use non-invasive tool evaluate endothelial function . Brachial FMD impair people coronary dysfunction , show predict future CV event well traditional CV risk factor . People asthma previously show impaired endothelial function compare non-asthmatics , underlie mechanism ( ) unclear . Chronic systemic inflammation establish risk factor predictor future CV event , level systemic inflammation show increase asthma related disease severity . While systemic inflammation directly impair vascular function , unknown asthma attack may affect vascular function CV risk . Thus , gain good understanding increase CV risk associate asthma exacerbation , first aim study evaluate acutely increase pulmonary inflammation affect vascular function people asthma . Physical inactivity previously associate increased systemic inflammation , high level physical activity reduce inflammation vascular dysfunction . Acute exercise show modulate systemic response inflammatory insult , physically active associate well asthma symptom whether acute exercise influence systemic response asthma exacerbation unknown . The second aim ass influence acute exercise systemic vascular response acute pulmonary inflammation asthma . OBJECTIVE 1 : To examine acute impact pulmonary inflammation bronchoconstriction systemic inflammation vascular function asthma . METHODS &amp; PROCEDURES , objective 1 : Outline : Asthmatics undergo screen three trial report laboratory morning two consecutive day ( Day 1 Day 2 ) per trial . The screening day establish presence/absence asthma consist pulmonary function test inhalation bronchodilator ( Salbutamol ) , exercise challenge cardiopulmonary fitness test . On Day 1 , baseline pulmonary function vascular function evaluate , venous blood sample exhale breath condensate also obtain evaluation baseline systemic pulmonary inflammation , respectively . The subject undergo either mannitol challenge ( Trial 1 ) , methacholine challenge ( Trial 2 ) , placebo ( saline ) challenge ( Trial 3 ) . At 1 hour post-challenge , another set vascular function measurement , systemic pulmonary inflammation measurement do . The subject ask come back 24 hour trial ( Day 2 ) follow-up evaluation vascular function systemic inflammation . The order trial randomize separate 1 week allow washout test . Pulmonary function : A standard pulmonary function test perform participant per establish clinical guideline . Pulmonary inflammation : Exhaled breath condensate collect use RTube™ analyzed level CRP marker oxidative stress . Systemic inflammation : The analysis serum CRP , IL-6 , TNFα , nitrate nitrite level outsource Eve Technologies , Calgary . Vascular function : Flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) brachial artery follow 5 minute forearm occlusion measure ultrasound image use ultrasound machine . FMD determine use Doppler ultrasound immediately release occlusion . The secondary outcome arterial stiffness , determine use carotid - femoral/brachial pulse wave velocity , PWV calculate measurement pulse transit time distance travel pulse record site . Mannitol , methacholine placebo challenge : Mannitol challenge show induce pulmonary inflammation addition bronchoconstriction asthmatic perform either cumulative dose 635 mg obtain reduction force expiratory volume first second ( FEV1 ) ≥15 % baseline value . If bronchoconstriction occur , FEV1 monitor every 10 minute spontaneous recovery within 5 % baseline FEV1 , reverse use 4 puff ( 100 mg/puff ) Salbutamol . Arterial oxygen saturation monitor throughout test . A methacholine challenge cause bronchoconstriction without increase pulmonary inflammation asthmatic use separate effect bronchoconstriction pulmonary inflammation vascular function . Except inhalation methacholine , perform accord establish guideline ( incremental concentration either 16 mg/ml methacholine inhale , 20 % reduction FEV1 ) , protocol use methacholine challenge placebo challenge . The subject blind order test . OBJECTIVE 2 : To evaluate influence acute exercise systemic inflammatory vascular response acute pulmonary inflammation . METHODS &amp; PROCEDURES , objective 2 : Outline : The design Objective 2 similar Mannitol challenge day Objective 1 except subject random order either ) exercise inhale mannitol , b ) exercise placebo ( saline ) , c ) rest inhale mannitol , ) rest placebo ( saline ) . In addition inflammatory marker measure Objective 1 , anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 measure serum time point ( baseline , 1 hour post-challenge , 1 day post-challenge ) . The exercise work load challenge day correspond 25 watt achieve workload anaerobic threshold screening day cardiopulmonary fitness test hold 30 minute . For inactive day , subject ask withhold exercise and/or moderate heavy physical activity 48 hour prior test . On rest trial day , subject report lab time day exercise instead rest quietly duration exercise period .</detailed_description>
