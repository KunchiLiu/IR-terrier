	<detailed_description>Diagnostic MR procedure scary stressful child parent . Because patient must lie still procedure provide diagnostic quality image , young child ( typically &lt; 7 year ) others expect comply often sedate give general anesthesia ( GA ) imaging procedure . However , high cost GA associate risk motivate search alternative . Previous report demonstrate preparation ( include use mock MR scanner ) reduce anxiety increase compliance clinical research MRI procedures without GA . However , systematic study advantage mock MR scanner versus train method lack . Furthermore , reduce use GA desirable , repeat unsuccessful scanning procedure also costly , identifying factor predict success diagnostic MR procedure important effectively allocate resource . Aims The overall goal study systematically investigate whether train mock MR scanner reduces need GA MRI scan child . There three specific aim : 1 . Determine whether pre-scan training allow child successful diagnostic MRI scan without general anesthesia . 2 . Examine effect different type pre-scan training reduce anxiety stress child parent related diagnostic MRI . 3 . Determine whether mock scanner train low age neuro-oncology patient able complete full diagnostic MRI without anesthesia compare historic control . Patient name , date birth , hospital identification number necessary perform chart review access diagnostic image . All identify information remove prior data analysis . The following data collected/recorded participant enrollment : 1 . Study number 2 . Sex 3 . Age time scan ( ) 4 . Type diagnostic scan request 5 . Parent report overall stress 6 . Parent proxy measure child stress/worry ( PedsQL ) 7 . Parent prediction child success MRI 8 . ( Aim 3 ) Primary Oncology Diagnosis : ) Site ii ) Histology 9 . ( Aim 3 ) Treatment mode ) Surgery ii ) Chemotherapy iii ) Radiotherapy Training Sessions For Aims 1 2 , participant randomly assign one three training group . Group 1 send link online videos MRI , audio file scanner noise , child 's book MR scan , prepare home . Group 2 receive training material visit ACH review research team , use mock scanner . Group 3 receive training material visit ACH training mock MR scanner . Visits mock scanner Group 3 include practice lie , stay still , wear headphone , watch movie mirror system . The Child Life Specialist talk child his/her family experience , allow 1 hour practice time mock scanner . For Aim 3 , participant receive train mock scanner similar group 3 difference Child Life Specialists utilize goal base preparation 3 X 20 minute session coincide visit hospital . All participant book one MR scan without GA one GA week later case first scan fails . The following data collect during/after training session : 1 . Total time spend preparing ( mock scanner ) 2 . Child 's feeling stress/worry visit ( PedsQL ) 3 . Head motion mock MRI session ( applicable ) Diagnostic MRI Sessions The following information record child 's MRI scan : 1 . Date MRI . 2 . Child 's age time scan . 3 . Scan success without anesthesia ( pass/fail ) 4 . Number sequence require repeat 5 . Total scan length ( min ) 6 . Sum individual scan sequence time ( min ) 7 . Quality image , determine pediatric neuro-radiologist grade Excellent ( motion artifact ) , Good ( minimal motion artifact ) ; Acceptable ( motion artifact ; satisfactory answer clinical question ) ; Unacceptable ( significant motion artifact ; unable answer clinical question ) 8 . Parent proxy measure child stress ( PedsQL ) 9 . Child 's stress/worry ( PedsQL ) 10 . ( Aims 1 2 ) Saliva sample measure cortical salivary alpha amylase diagnostic MR scan If image deem suitable clinical diagnosis , subsequent GA booking cancel . No raw image retain patient outside hospital record . For Aim 3 prospective data , information record scan session patient able complete entire scan without anesthesia . For Aim 3 retrospective data : The patient 's hospital identification number use identify MRI scan perform patient 3 year prior study . The MRI report cross reference department anesthesia electronic database determine date thereby age MRI without GA able perform . In case MRI report state scan perform GA electronic record GA present paper chart review determine GA perform . If The MRI scan report specify GA perform anesthesia record MRI exist scan consider perform GA. Statistical Plan An ANOVA use evaluate group difference scan success measure . Additional analyse focus correlation scan success age , sex , measure child/parent stress , cortisone , salivary alpha amylase , train session compliance . Aim 3 also explicitly test difference mean age month neuro-oncology patient able successfully complete diagnostic MRI without anesthesia group without mock scanner training . These compare utilizing T-test Kaplan-Meier Analysis .</detailed_description>
