	<detailed_description>About 150-200 individual present emergency department King County , primarily Harborview Medical Center ( HMC ) , firearm-related injury year . Almost two-third patient require admission injury . While number patient firearm injury present HMC relatively small , individual substantially increase risk subsequent re-hospitalization another firearm assault-related injury , arrest firearm-related violent crime , non-firearm-related nonviolent crime firearm-related death five year discharge hospital . Thus , intervention among high risk population potential reduce recidivism , morbidity , mortality well decrease firearm violence consequence community . Patients gunshot wound ( GSWs ) see HMC receive many service ; however , currently standardize intervention offer GSW patient . A number hospital across country create violence prevention intervention program help patient sustain violent injury . These program engage patient hospital recovery period , see opportunity ( `` teachable moment '' ) change life reduce retaliation recidivism . As result grow number violence prevention intervention program , National Network Hospital-based Violence Intervention Programs , establish . Through work group , meeting , e-newsletter , conference , Network member collaborate research evaluation , explore opportunity fund sustainability , develop share best practice , identify way collectively impact policy . While creation infrastructure step right direction , researcher rigorously test effectiveness intervention program . Specifically , trial evaluate effectiveness hospital-based violence intervention program offer GSW victim . The investigator aim conduct cluster randomize trial violence intervention program combine brief , hospital-based intervention , structured outreach program , multi-agency attention . Study staff provide brief intervention derive motivational interviewing ( MI ) . MI patient-centered behavioral technique base stage change model attempt engage patient order find reason change behavior . By empathetically explore ambivalent feeling health-related behavior , MI encourage reduction risky behavior . Research demonstrate effectiveness provide MI-based brief intervention Emergency Department ( ED ) inpatient ward , primarily alcohol use disorder also violent behavior . Specifically , brief , MI intervention successful reduce youth violence large urban population , effect sustain one year . Additionally , behavioral-based intervention include MI target adolescent admit HMC trauma show reduction weapon carriage year post-hospitalization . A longitudinal outreach intervention program provide added benefit continue engagement . GSW patient must transition back community hospitalization , transitional period , patient must navigate complex fragmented system care , especially challenge . Providing GSW patient outreach follow-up healthcare encounter hold promise reducing future violence criminal activity . The Critical Time Intervention ( CTI ) approach may provide strong framework provide patient appropriate outreach follow-up . Strong evidence support CTI 's effectiveness . The CTI model meet Coalition Evidence-based Policy 's rigorous `` Top Tier '' standard intervention : well-designed implemented randomize controlled trial , preferably conduct typical community setting , [ ] produce sizable , sustain benefit participant and/or society . CTI time-limited , evidence-based case management model mobilize support society 's vulnerable individual period transition discharge inpatient service community . It facilitate community integration continuity care ensure person endure tie community support system critical period . CTI use worldwide among veteran , people mental illness , homeless incarcerated individual , many group . From begin , CTI think intervention could apply myriad context . This approach potential provide intervention framework second tier outreach GSW victim King County .</detailed_description>
