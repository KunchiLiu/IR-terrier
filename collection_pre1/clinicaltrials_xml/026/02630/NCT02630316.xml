	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize ( 1:1 inhale treprostinil : placebo ) , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial evaluate safety efficacy inhale treprostinil subject pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) associate interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) include combine pulmonary fibrosis emphysema ( CPFE ) . The study include 314 patient approximately 120 clinical trial center . The treatment phase study last approximately 16 week . Patients complete require assessment also eligible enter open-label , extension study ( RIN-PH-202 ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Subject voluntarily give informed consent participate study . 2 . Males female age 18 year old time inform consent . . Females reproductive potential must nonpregnant ( confirm urine pregnancy test screening ) nonlactating , : . Either abstain intercourse ( line prefer usual lifestyle ) , ii . Use two medically acceptable , highlyeffective form contraception duration study , least 30 day discontinue study drug . b . Males partner childbearing potential must use condom duration treatment least 48 hour discontinue study drug . 3 . The subject confirm diagnosis WHO Group 3 PH base CT imaging , demonstrate evidence diffuse parenchymal lung disease perform within 6 month prior randomization . Subjects may form ILD CPFE . 4 . Subjects require right heart catheterization ( RHC ) within one year prior randomization follow documented parameter : 1 . Pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) &gt; 3 Wood Units ( WU ) 2 . A pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) &lt; 15 mmHg 3 . A mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( mPAP ) ≥ 25 mmHg 5 . Baseline 6MWD ≥ 100 meter 6 . Subjects chronic medication underlie lung disease ( ie , pirfenidone , nintedanib , etc ) must stable optimize dose ≥ 30 day prior randomization . Subjects receive pirfenidone nintedanib must receive treatment least 90 day stable dose least 30 day prior randomization . 7 . In opinion Investigator , subject able communicate effectively study personnel , consider reliable , willing likely cooperative protocol requirement , include attend study visit . 8 . Subjects connective tissue disease ( CTD ) must Baseline FVC &lt; 70 % . Exclusion criterion : 1 . The subject diagnosis pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) PH reason WHO Group 3 PHILD outline inclusion criterion 3 . 2 . The subject show intolerance significant lack efficacy prostacyclin prostacyclin analogue result discontinuation inability effectively titrate therapy . 3 . The subject receive PAH approve therapy include : prostacyclin therapy ( i.e. , epoprostenol , treprostinil , iloprost , beraprost ; except acute vasoreactivity test ) , IP receptor agonist ( selexipag ) , endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) , phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor ( PDE5I ) , soluble guanylate cyclase ( sGC ) within 60 day randomization . 4 . The subject evidence clinically significant leftsided heart disease define : 1 . PCWP &gt; 15 mmHg 2 . Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % . Note : Subjects abnormal leave ventricular function attributable entirely impaired leave ventricular filling due effect right ventricular overload ( i.e. , right ventricular hypertrophy and/or dilatation ) exclude . 5 . The subject receive &gt; 10 L/min oxygen supplementation mode delivery rest Baseline . 6 . Current use inhale tobacco/marijuana product significant history drug abuse time inform consent . 7 . Exacerbation underlie lung disease active pulmonary upper respiratory infection within 30 day randomization . 8 . Initiation pulmonary rehabilitation within 12 week prior randomization . 9 . In opinion Investigator , subject condition would interfere interpretation study assessment disease condition ( ie , peripheral vascular disease , musculoskeletal disorder , morbid obesity ) would likely primary limit ambulation ( opposed PH ) . 10 . Use investigational drug/device , participation investigational study therapeutic intent within 30 day prior randomization . 11 . Severe concomitant illness limit life expectancy ( &lt; 6 month ) . 12 . Acute pulmonary embolism within 90 day randomization .</criteria>
