	<detailed_description>There 3 cohort study . Cohort A &amp; Cohort B patient subject . Patients participate cohort simultaneously , one cohort per patient preference . The investigator anticipate patient participate Cohort B also participate Cohort A Cohort A require one-time blood draw baseline . Cohort C healthy volunteer . The purpose recruiting health volunteer purely test CTC chip system investigator routinely spike ( inject ) tumor cell line healthy human blood ensure optimal CTC yield ( quality control ) . Cohort A : 20 patient NSCLC 20 patient SCLC . Blood sample collect eligible patient baseline . These sample immediately process CTCs CTC derive xenograft . Cohort B : 15 patient NSCLC 15 patient SCLC . Blood sample collect eligible patient baseline prior initiation therapy . Samples also collect day 1 every cycle therapy 4 cycle ( typical cycle 21 day chemotherapy , 28 day target therapy 14 day immune therapy ) . At time initiation treatment break , blood sample collect . During treatment break , patient follow every 6-12 week image study , collect blood sample visit . At time disease progression event patient go best supportive care , last blood draw time decision unlikely image study go forward . If patient find disease progression active therapy , next blood draw first day next therapy time point subsequent blood draw depend type therapy patient receives . The goal define whether CTC load whether CTC load predict symptom , response , disease recurrence . For Cohorts A &amp; B : Investigators make every attempt time blood collection coincide blood collection therapeutic purpose order minimize discomfort . Blood sample collection take place outpatient clinic . Patients participate cohort simultaneously , one cohort per patient preference . Cohort C : 10 subject . Blood sample collect eligible health volunteer . These sample use test CTC chip system investigator routinely spike ( inject ) tumor cell line healthy human blood ensure optimal CTC yield ( quality control ) . Two sample peripheral blood collect take Principal Investigator 's lab processing .</detailed_description>
