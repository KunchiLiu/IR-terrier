	<brief_summary>The study plan conduct 2 part . The first part ( open label , multi-center , non-controlled ) study estimate dose would provide mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) exposure pediatric participant comparable achieve adult liver transplant participant receive approve dose mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF , CellCept ) . The second part ( open-label , multi-center , single-arm Phase IV study ) study provide pharmacokinetics , efficacy safety profile propose dose immediate post-transplant period . This study conduct two center base United States America . Twelve pediatric transplant participant receive first liver allograft cadaveric living donor enrol study . Stable pediatric liver transplant participant least 6 month post-transplant already receive stable dose MMF combination cyclosporine enrol study . Participants receive stable MMF dose accord center practice least seven day order get steady state pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . Participants also receive stable concomitant dos cyclosporine ( least 2 day ) corticosteroids per center practice . Participants age 9 month 12 year , least 6 participant great equal ( &gt; /= ) 9 month less ( &lt; ) 36 month , least 2 &lt; 24 month .</brief_summary>
