	<brief_title>Study Comparing Two Different Schedules Palbociclib Plus Second Line Endocrine Therapy Women With Estrogen Receptor Positive , HER2 Negative Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard usual treatment type breast cancer endocrine therapy . Palbociclib new type drug breast cancer . Laboratory test well study animals people show may help slow growth breast cancer . The widely test regimen Palbociclib patient metastatic/advanced breast cancer 125 mg every day 21 day 28 day cycle combination standard endocrine ( hormone ) therapy . This study explore administer low dose palbociclib - 100 mg give every day 28 day cycle combination standard endocrine ( hormone ) therapy - may result tumour shrinkage well tolerate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Premenopausal postmenopausal woman 18 year age old . Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma breast , ER positive HER2 negative status base local test recent pathological tumour specimen . Patients must satisfy follow criterion prior therapy : Progressed treatment within 12 month completion adjuvant endocrine therapy Progressed prior endocrine therapy advanced/metastatic disease . Note : 'Progressed endocrine therapy ' mean patient progress within 1 month discontinuation endocrine therapy . One line chemotherapy advanced/metastatic disease ( regardless prior adjuvant chemotherapy use ) allow addition endocrine therapy . Patients must evidence disease eligible study , measurable disease mandatory . For patient measureable disease include response assessment , follow criterion must apply : Xray ≥ 20 mm Spiral CT scan physical exam ≥ 10 mm ( lymph node must ≥ 15 mm short axis ) Conventional CT scan , MRI ≥ 20 mm Measurable lesion must outside previous radiotherapy field sole site disease , unless disease progression document . Tumor lesions previously irradiate subject loco regional therapy deem measurable progression treat site completion therapy clearly document . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 02 .
