	<brief_summary>This study single center open label phase I study AZD6738 , DNA damage repair/novel cancer agent , combination paclitaxel metastatic cancer patient fail standard chemotherapy . AZD6738 orally dose selective potent inhibitor Ataxia Telangiectasis Rad3 Related ( ATR ) kinase good selectivity Pi3 kinase family member . ATR serine/threonine protein kinase member phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related kinase ( PIKK ) family . During normal replication , ATR recruit stalled replication fork progress double strand break leave unrepaired . ATR also recruit single strand DNA coat Replication Protein A ( RPA ) follow single strand DNA damage resection double strand break . Recruitment activation ATR lead cell cycle arrest S phase DNA repair stalled replication fork resolve , nuclear fragmentation entry program cell death ( apoptosis ) . In clinic ATR inhibitor expect cause growth inhibition tumour cell dependent upon ATR DNA repair e.g . ATM-deficient tumour . In addition monotherapy activity , ATR inhibitor also predict potentiate activity cytotoxic DNA damaging agent radiotherapy ( inhibition ATR-dependent DNA repair process ) use combination . While significant enhancement anti-tumour activity may achieve , data AZD6738 suggest potential need reduce ATR inhibitor dose intensity ( relative monotherapy dose ) introduce dose break allow normal tissue recovery use combination systemic DNA damaging chemotherapy agent , order maintain tolerable therapeutic margin . The mechanism action AZD6738 suggest potential combine number anti-cancer treatment , result either synergistic additive activity . This study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics anti-tumour activity AZD6738 increase dos , combination paclitaxel one standard salvage regimen patient advance cancer . The study consist two part , evaluate safety tolerability specific combination agent , paclitaxel different drug schedule . An oral formulation AZD6738 use . The PART A combination paclitaxel ; start dose 40 mg AZD6738 OD escalate reach maximum tolerate dose patient advance solid malignancy , define dose-limiting toxicity . The PART B independent parallel PK expansion cohort cycle 0 AZD6738 D1 , D8~D21 monotherapy follow combination therapy weekly paclitaxel cycle 1 . Investigators modify recruit minimum maximum number patient depend data generate study use AZD6738 .</brief_summary>
