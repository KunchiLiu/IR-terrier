	<brief_title>Trial Index Cholecystectomy Versus Scheduled Cholecystectomy Biliary Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : There still considerable debate regard optimal time cholecystectomy mild biliary pancreatitis . It widely accept wait patient 's clinical condition allow perform cholecystectomy severe biliary pancreatitis systemic local complication . On hand , recommendation clear come patient mild biliary pancreatitis . The British Society Gastroenterology American Gastroenterological Association guideline recommendation perform cholecystectomy within 2-to 4- week interval initial episode . However , safety cholecystectomy perform episode pancreatitis also controversial . In systematic review overall readmission rate 18 % index cholecystectomy , 8 % recurrent biliary pancreatitis , 3 % acute cholecystitis 7 % biliary colic . Methods The study perform Randomised control trial two parallel arm ratio 1:1 . Patients admit acute pancreatitis check eligibility criterion study . Mild pancreatitis define pancreatitis without local complication necrosis organ failure . Patients eligible obtained oral write information study invite include . Patients accept participation sign consent form include . The included patient randomize index cholecystectomy ( IC ) schedule cholecystectomy ( SC ) . Randomization do seal envelope system . The allocation sequence create online random generator . There block . After randomization , patient well responsible immediately informed allocation . The IC SC protocolled perform within 24-48 hour randomization , 6 week discharge respectively . Daily blood sample , pain well-being score obtain index admission discharge , 1-month follow-up SC group schedule cholecystectomy . Quality life assess SF-36 prior randomization 4 week inclusion . Pain measured McGill Pain Questionnaire randomization daily discharge two day inclusion . Sample size estimation If IC reduce risk gallstone- treatment-related adverse event 40 % 10 % , total sample 32 patient group require order reach chance 80 % detect significant difference p &lt; 0.05 level . In order compensate drop-outs , total sample 70 stipulate .</detailed_description>
