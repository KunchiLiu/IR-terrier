	<brief_summary>TetraGraph newly develop EMG-based ( electromyograph ) , quantitative , battery-powered neuromuscular monitoring system intend daily clinical use . The primary aim clinical investigation examine applicability ( ease use , equipment need , etc . ) , repeatability ( precision internal consistency ) performance ( signal quality , accuracy outcome , voltage stimulation output stimulus ) tolerability Tetragraph device healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurostimulation Electromyographs Assessment th TetraGraph Healthy ( Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint assessment ability TetraGraph prototype deliver neuro-stimulation , assessment ability acquire muscle action potential record evoke responses SD-card . The study perform healthy volunteer - 10 male 10 female . Testing do two separate stimulation/recording site : ulnar nerve stimulation/abductor digiti minimi ( ADM ) muscle record ; ulnar nerve stimulation/adductor pollex ( AP ) muscle record . The side testing ( RIGHT vs. LEFT hand ) determine priori randomly principal investigator , 10 volunteer test RIGHT 10 LEFT hand . At stimulating/recording site two stimulation protocol ( single twitch stimulation train-of-four stimulation ) perform grow current intensity ( 10-60 mA ( milliAmps ) , 10 mA step-up fashion ) . Volunteers rate tolerability stimulation protocols visual analogue scale . EMG data record SD card evaluate off-line .</detailed_description>
