	<brief_summary>This phase 0 trial study ixazomib citrate treating patient glioblastoma spread returned period improvement planning undergo surgery . When give mouth , ixazomib citrate may able reach tumor cell brain . Studying sample tissue , blood , plasma laboratory patient receive ixazomib citrate may help doctor learn effect ixazomib citrate cell . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>
