Subjects solid tumor , exception castrationresistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , must demonstrate measurable disease , per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 . All prior treatment related toxicity must National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCICTCAE ) v4.03 &lt; =Grade 1 ( except alopecia [ permissible Grade ] peripheral neuropathy [ must &lt; = Grade 2 ] ) time treatment allocation . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status score 0 1 .

A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation , hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , hysterectomy , document bilateral tubal oophorectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 unit ( U ) /mL estradiol &lt; 40 picograms ( pg ) /mL ( &lt; 140 picomoles ( pmol ) /L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception 7 month last dose study medication . Negative serum pregnancy test &lt; =7 day prior first study drug dose .

Male subject female partner child bear potential must agree use one method contraception specify . This method must use time first dose study medication 16 week last dose study medication . In addition , male subject whose partner become pregnant study medication must continue use condom 7 day stop study medication Primary malignancy central nervous system malignancy relate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) solid organ transplant . More three prior line cytotoxic therapy . Recent prior therapy , define follow : 1 ) Any investigational Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve anticancer drug within 14 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , prior first dose GSK2820151 . Any nitrosoureas mitomycin C within 42 day prior first dose GSK2820151 . Prior therapy monoclonal antibody permit long 14 day elapse since therapy therapyrelated toxicity resolve Grade 1 less . Note investigational drug define drug without approve oncologic indication . 2 ) Any radiotherapy within 14 day major surgery within 28 day prior first dose GSK2820151 . 3 ) Antiandrogen therapy prostate cancer , bicalutamide , must stop 4 week prior enrollment . Secondline hormone therapy enzalutamide , abiraterone , orteronel stop 2 week prior enrolment . Subjects prostate cancer remain luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonists antagonist .

Therapeutic anticoagulation ( e.g. , warfarin , heparin ) must discontinue coagulation parameter must normalize prior first dose GSK2820151 . Low dose ( prophylactic ) low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) permit . In addition , INR must monitor accordance local institutional practice . Current use prohibit medication plan use forbidden medication treatment GSK2820151 . Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , unstable uncompensated respiratory , hepatic , renal , cardiac disease , clinically significant bleed episode ) . Any serious and/or unstable preexist medical ( aside malignancy ) , psychiatric disorder , condition could interfere subject 's safety , obtain informed consent compliance study procedure , opinion Investigator . Symptomatic untreated leptomeningeal brain metastasis spinal cord compression . NOTE : Subjects previously treat condition stable central nervous system ( CNS ) disease ( verified consecutive imaging study ) &gt; 1 month , asymptomatic corticosteroid , stable dose corticosteroid least 1 month prior study Day 1 permit .
