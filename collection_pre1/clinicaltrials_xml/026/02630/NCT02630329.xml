	<brief_summary>Objective : To compare vNOTES ( vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery ) establish laparoscopic removal benign adnexal mass Study design : Randomized controlled/single center/single-blinded/parallel-group/non-inferiority/efficacy trial . Study population : Women age 18 70 year symptomatic persistent benign adnexal mass detect clinical examination ultrasound . Randomization : Women randomly allocate undergo one two technique removal benign adnexal mass immediately surgery use computer generate randomization list . The investigator use stratified randomization accord cyst diameter . Intervention : Women treat surgeon blind treatment allocation equally skilled perform technique . In intervention group vNOTES technique use . Control : In control group surgery do classical laparoscopic technique . Participants , nurse staff outcome assessor blind . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary outcome : successful removal benign adnexal mass without spill . Secondary outcome : proportion woman discharge day base preference ; postoperative pain score use VAS ( Visual Analogue Scale ) measure day 1 till 7 participate woman follow surgery total amount analgesic use described standardized pain treatment protocol day 1 till 7 ; postoperative infection define low abdominal pain fever &gt; 38Â°C positive clinical sign laboratory finding ; per- postoperative complication accord Clavien- Dindo classification detect first six week surgery ; duration surgical procedure ; incidence intensity dyspareunia record participant 3 6 month self-reporting use simple questionnaire VAS scale ; sexual wellbeing record participant 3 6 month SSFS ( Short Sexual Functioning Scale ) ; direct cost associate 6 week surgical intervention procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives NOTABLE Trial The primary research question IDEAL stage 2b efficacy trial follow : vNOTES adnexectomy least effective compare standard transabdominal laparoscopic approach ( LSC ) remove benign adnexal mass without spill ? ( non-inferiority design ) Secondary research question : - Do woman treat vNOTES prefer leave hospital day surgery compare LSC ? - Do woman treat vNOTES suffer less pain compare woman treat LSC first postoperative week ? - Is removal benign adnexal mass vNOTES faster compare LSC ? - Does vNOTES cause pelvic infection complication compare LSC ? - Does vNOTES cause hospital readmission within 6 week follow surgery compare LSC ? - Does vNOTES approach result woman report dyspareunia , less sexual wellbeing less health-related quality life 3 6 month surgery compare woman treat LSC ? - What direct indirect cost 6 week vNOTES compare LSC ? TRIAL DESIGN 2.1 . Design A single center , single-blinded , parallel group randomize , non-inferiority efficacy trial . 2.2 . Simple pilot randomize trial : minimal extra workload 2.3 . Time schedule Based upon mean number laparoscopic adnexectomies perform annually department Obstetrics Gynecology participate center ( 36 ) investigator estimate duration recruitment 21 month . Based upon follow ( 6 month ) period analysis/reporting ( 3 month ) total study period 2.5 year . 2.4 . Participating center Department Obstetrics Gynecology Imeldahospital Imeldalaan 9 2820 Bonheiden Belgium 3 . ELIGIBILITY , CONSENT AND RANDOMIZATION 3.1 . Screening consent prior surgery All woman age 18 70 year regardless parity present symptomatic asymptomatic persistent benign adnexal mass clinical examination confirm ultrasound eligible inclusion . The diagnosis benign adnexal mass base upon prospectively validate IOTA classification ( International Ovarian Tumour Analysis Group ) simple ultrasound rule distinguish benign malignant adnexal mass . 3.2 . Determining eligibility All woman age 18 70 year regardless parity present symptomatic asymptomatic persistent benign adnexal mass clinical examination provide consent participation eligible NOTABLE trial base finding ultrasound finding randomize procedure . 3.3 . Randomization If woman eligible NOTABLE trial , trial secretary obtain randomized allocation day surgery . This do use randomization list generate free computer software program offer Research Randomizer ( http : //www.randomizer.org ) . The random sequence generation conceal use sequentially number opaque seal envelope . The envelope open nurse assistant day surgical intervention logistic reason . The investigator use stratified randomization small pilot RCT ( randomize control trial ) accord cyst diameter . 3.4 . Patients strong preference treatment A minority woman express clear preference one treatment ( e.g . strong desire scar ) reason wish randomize surgical treatment . To investigate outcome vary choice , woman could follow exactly way woman randomize NOTABLE trial . A formal non-randomized follow-up woman do simple logistical reason . 3.5 . Stratification randomization A blocked randomization procedure use avoid chance imbalance parameter 'cyst diameter ' . To avoid possibility foreknowledge , randomize allocation give eligibility stratification data give . 4 . TREATMENT ALLOCATIONS 4.1 . Surgical procedures The principal investigator , train experience laparoscopy NOTES , perform surgical procedure . He therefore blind . All vNOTES participant blind three superficial `` mock '' skin incision similar routinely do laparoscopic technique . 4.1.1 vNOTES adnexectomy This surgical procedure do intervention arm NOTABLE trial . 4.1.2 LSC adnexectomy This surgical procedure do control arm NOTABLE trial . 5 . FOLLOW-UP AND OUTCOME MEASURES 5.1 . Clinical assessment 5.1.1 Format PROMs collect use postal questionnaire , include combination disease specific generic measurement instrument . The postal questionnaire send NOTABLE Trial Office postage pay envelopes two week due date . Reminders send participant questionnaire return within one week due date attempt make contact woman phone questionnaire return two week due date . 5.1.2 Timing assessment The primary outcome measure clinically end surgical procedure . In addition PROMs take place even surgical intervention ( return home ) , first postoperative week ( pain VAS score analgetic drug ) 3 6 month ( dyspareunia/ sexual well being/ health relate quality life ) . Clinical physician assessment take place even surgical intervention ( return home ) first six week follow surgery ( pelvic infection , surgical complication , hospital readmission rate ) . 5.2 . Primary clinical outcome measure The proportion woman successfully treat remove adnexal mass without spill , use dichotomous outcome measure , use measure efficacy . 5.3 . Secondary clinical outcome measure The following secondary outcome measure : - The proportion woman admit in-hospital least one night observation base preference , dichotomous outcome . - Postoperative pain score , ordinal outcome , measure use VAS scale twice daily day 1 till 7 self-reported participate woman . - Postoperative pain define total amount analgesic use described standardized pain treatment protocol , continuous outcome . - Postoperative infection dichotomous outcome . - Per- postoperative complication accord Clavien- Dindo classification detect first six week surgery , dichotomous outcome . - Hospital readmission within 6 week follow surgery , dichotomous outcome . - Incidence intensity dyspareunia record participant 3 6 month self-reporting use simple questionnaire VAS scale , dichotomous ordinal outcome . . - Sexual wellbeing baseline , 3 6 month self-reporting SSFS ( Short Sexual Functioning Scale ) . - Health-related quality life , baseline , 3 6 month self-reporting EQ-5D-3L questionnaire . - Duration surgery measure time minute insertion bladder catheter end vaginal/abdominal wound closure , continuous outcome . 5.4 . Health economic outcomes The direct indirect cost techniques 6 week surgical intervention calculate . 6 . ACCRUAL AND ANALYSIS 6.1 . Sample size The sample size trial choose give good statistical power preclude clinically important inferiority vNOTES compare laparoscopy base evidence retrieve systematic review literature RCT compare excision mature teratoma use culdotomy without laparoscopy . Based power calculation primary outcome two secondary outcome assume loss-to-follow-up rate 10 % investigator decide include 66 study participant NOTABLE trial . 6.2 . Projected accrual attrition rate It anticipate recruitment participant take two year . Based upon mean number laparoscopic adnexectomies perform annually department Obstetrics Gynecology participate center ( 36 ) investigator estimate duration recruitment 21 month . Based upon follow ( 6 month ) period analysis/reporting ( 3 month ) total study period 2.5 year . First publication possible within four year trial commencement .</detailed_description>
