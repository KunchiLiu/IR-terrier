	<brief_summary>The overall goal renewal replicate finding Seamos Saludables Latina woman , increase effectiveness intervention , measure intervention-related change clinical biomarkers . We enhance exist intervention incorporate participant feedback ( desire great interactivity accountability ) , target Social Cognitive Theory ( SCT ) construct influenced overall original intervention yet improve amongst successful participant ( social support , outcome expectancy ) , respond change trend technology use Latinos . We conduct clinical trial among Latina woman California randomize either 1 ) original Seamos Saludables tailor print intervention 2 ) theory text messaging-enhanced interactive technology base version Seamos Saludables intervention . We also measure change cardiovascular metabolic biomarkers ( e.g. , HbA1c , LDL ) assess potential clinical impact intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Latinos large racial/ethnic minority group U.S. , report substantial widen health disparity . Prevalence type II diabetes 60-100 % high Latinos non-Latino Whites , incidence Latinos project increase 500 % 20503 . The large disparity project Latino woman ( Latinas ) . Rates overweight obesity 23 % 37 % high Latinas White woman respectively , grown faster Mexican American woman , far large subgroup Latinas , White woman past decade . Given Latinos project comprise nearly one-third US population 2050 , signifies press public health concern term cost , diminish quality life , lose life year . Interventions therefore need linguistically adapt population address specific barrier . `` Mediated '' intervention delivery approach ( e.g. , mail , phone , web deliver ) emphasize home-based , lifestyle activity show large effect size face-to-face approach , cost-effective , likely sustainable , may particularly appropriate Latinas , reduce burden time , childcare , transportation , barrier commonly cite Latinas . Thus previously fund parent grant ( R01NR011295 ) respond PAR-07-379 , `` Behavioral Social Science Research Understanding Reducing Health Disparities , '' modify exist print-based mail-delivered PA intervention adapt specifically Latinas North Eastern U.S. low acculturation , literacy , socioeconomic status ( SES ) , test modify intervention randomize control trial ( N=266 ) . Participants PA intervention arm show significantly great increase least moderate intensity activity , increase 1.87 min/week baseline 73.36 min/week 6 month ( vs. 3.02 min/week 32.98 min/week contact control group ) . However , still well national guideline 150 minute per week . This intervention therefore show potential promote initial PA adoption , yet enhancement need help people achieve level PA prevent disease reduce health disparity . The objective renewal 1 ) enhance intervention achieve great increase PA , 2 ) ass potential clinical impact measure change biomarkers , 3 ) increase generalizability replicate Latina woman , would goal design innovative behavioral intervention promote health prevent illness diverse population .</detailed_description>
