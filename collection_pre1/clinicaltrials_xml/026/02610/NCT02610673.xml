	<brief_title>WiCS-LV Post Market Surveillance Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A clinical registry use collect data implant patient , follow-ups across implant center . Implant procedure accord 'Instruction Use ' system assessment follow-ups accord best clinical practice . Anonymized data collect Case Report Forms ( CRF ) patient registry . These data collect time implant schedule patient in-clinic follow-up 1 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 , 2,3,4,5 year post implant . Patients enter registry give Registry code suitable uniquely identify patient , implant center , responsible physician . Data consolidate dataset sponsor analysis purpose . The sponsor may request support center review patient record order monitor data case data appear incomplete appear inaccurate . The data set consolidate implant center may access data , mutually agree center , aggregate data . Data may use center purpose publication objective center .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients heart failure meet standard criterion CRT base upon current European Society Cardiology / European Heart Rhythm Association ( ESC/EHRA ) guideline meet criterion one categorization : Untreated conventional CRT : This include : Patients attempt failed CS lead implant due complication venous occlusion , difficult CS access anatomy , poor lead stability previous CS repositioning procedure . Patients previously implant CS lead program due complication high pace threshold , noncapture , phrenic nerve stimulation , lead failure , lead dislodgement , justification due lead issue document prescribe physician . Nonresponder conventional CRT This include : â€¢ Patients previously implant CRT device base prescribe physician judgment experience change worsen heart failure symptom change worsen NYHA functional class 6 month CRT treatment . Upgrade : This include : Patients relative contraindication CS lead implant difficult subclavian access , venous thrombosis , venous occlusion , risk lead dislodgment , justification document prescribe physician . Patients relative contraindication revise implanted device CRT device previous pocket erosion , previous pocket infection , previous explantations , justification document prescribe physician . Patients justification base upon prescribe physician 's judgment risk reopen device pocket include consideration remain longevity pacemaker/ICD battery .
