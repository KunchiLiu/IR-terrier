PoCAH theory base , patient-centered , tailored self-management program deliver via mHealth technology orthopaedic ambulatory surgery patient . Patients treatment usual group receive standard discharge care instruction provide iPad mini . Patients intervention group ( treatment usual combine PoCAH ) access PoCAH app , addition standard discharge care instruction .

The investigator call patient home Day 2 facilitate data collection . At conclusion study ( Day 5 ) , participant intervention group evaluate utility effectiveness PoCAH app . The iPad mini Patient Diaries return research staff patient attend physician 's office first office visit 5 day post-surgery . Because course post discharge symptom extend past 5 day , phone interview 2 week 4 week include well describe recovery trajectory outcome operative patient .</detailed_description>
