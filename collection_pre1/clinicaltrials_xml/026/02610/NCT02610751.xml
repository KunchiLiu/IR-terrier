	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study laboratory research perform animal model reveal effect maternal smoking pregnancy go beyond perinatal period due effect nicotine increase fetal testosterone level . This great concern increase fetal testosterone link impaired reproductive development infertility male female offspring , early onset menarche female , short body height , increase BMI , shorten anogenital distance low second digit fourth digit finger length ratio . Additionally elevated fetal testosterone level associate development psychosocial disorder Autism , ADHD , antisocial behavior , conduct disorder , adult criminal behavior , sensation seek behavior . Although animal study investigate effect maternal nicotine exposure fetal testosterone level review epidemiologic literature subsequent adverse implication , know human study perform investigate relationship maternal smoking pregnancy female fetal testosterone level .</detailed_description>
