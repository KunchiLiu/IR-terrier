	<brief_title>Evaluation Targeted Parasite Elimination ( TPE ) Namibia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , many country , include Namibia , experience reduction malaria transmission association scale-up effective intervention move towards malaria elimination . In malaria control , goal reduce clinical burden malaria . In malaria elimination , aim interrupt transmission , becomes necessary address symptomatic malaria , also asymptomatic infection contribute transmission . Since malaria transmission highly geographically heterogeneous , elimination activity target hot spot , area risk future infection high . Hence , transition control elimination , enhance surveillance response necessary target hot spots intervention interrupt transmission . Reactive case detection ( RACD ) , active surveillance community around passively detect case , recommend elimination strategy identify secondary case hot spot . However , RACD labour- , time- , cost- intensive , miss people absent screen refuse blood drawn . Furthermore , microscopy rapid diagnostic test ( RDTs ) utilize RACD shortcoming , instance , suboptimal sensitivity RDTs low parasite density non-falciparum infection . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) offer markedly improve sensitivity RDTs require hour process time , sophisticated technical skill , expensive equipment . Given limitation , presumptive treatment may feasible effective strategy reduce interrupt transmission . Targeted Parasite Elimination ( TPE ) , form presumptive treatment , use successfully China overcome weakness RACD . TPE coordinate use vector parasite control , target people high risk malaria . In low transmission set Namibia , small proportion population high risk infection , therefore , small number people need target ( perhaps 20-50 people ) . TPE target remain reservoirs infection low endemic setting . A TPE approach include locally implement presumptive treatment -- people treat base proximity malaria case rather test result . TPE promise strategy , evidence yet exist prove efficacy Africa . Questions remain target TPE , drug use , whether drug use alone combination additional vector control . For TPE successful necessary kill parasites human well vector population target area . However , one challenge pre-transmission season IRS difficult predict future infection occur . A reactive approach , conjunction pre-transmission approach , ensure coverage effective vector control high risk area . Further , unknown resistance insecticide use pre-transmission season , subsequent reactive use different , presumably effective insecticide , provide good protection . In study investigator utilise cluster randomize control study design evaluate TPE response passively identify index case compare RACD . The investigator study intervention ( TPE , RACD ) without additional focal insecticide spraying .</detailed_description>
