	<brief_summary>Background : Most people infected influenza virus mild symptom . But get sick even die . Antibodies part blood call plasma fight germ like influenza . Researchers want see plasma high level antibody help plasma low level transfuse people influenza . They plasma people high level antibody infect influenza get influenza vaccine . They also plasma low antibody . Objective : To see plasma high level antibody work well plasma low level treat influenza . Eligibility : People age 2 week old hospitalize symptom influenza Design : Participants screen medical history blood urine test . They may nasal wash test influenza . For , get saline rinse one nostril . A plastic tube insert nostril collect fluid . The study last 28 day . Participants get routine influenza care . This include standard drug possible chest x-ray . On Day 1 , participant : Physical exam Blood test Throat swab 2 dos plasma high antibody low antibody IV catheter ( tube ) vein . On Days 3 7 , participant return clinic , longer hospitalize , 1-hour visit . The visit include : Medical exam Blood test Throat swab On Days 2 , 14 , 28 , participant evaluate either clinic phone . They talk symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Significant morbidity mortality influenza infection occur despite treatment current antiviral . This randomized , double-blinded , multicenter phase 3 trial ass efficacy safety high-titer versus low-titer anti-influenza immune plasma addition standard care antiviral treatment severe influenza A. Hospitalized subject severe influenza A eligible study participation . Up 40 site United States participate protocol . Adults child may participate . There exclusion pregnancy . A total 150 eligible subject randomize 2:1 ratio receive either high-titer anti-influenza plasma control ( low-titer ) plasma . All plasma male donor minimize risk TRALI . Subjects assess Study Day 0 ( baseline ) Study Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 . For participant hospitalize Days 2 , 14 , 28 , contact participant purpose limit study data collection day may perform telephone . Study visit Days 1 , 3 , 7 must occur person . All subject undergo series efficacy , safety , HAI assessment study . Blood sample collect Day 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 . OP swab influenza PCR obtain Days 0 3 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ENROLLMENT ( SCREENING ) : Hospitalization due sign symptom influenza ( decision hospitalization individual treating clinician ) . Study plasma available onsite available within 24 hour randomization . Not previously screen randomize study . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RANDOMIZATION : The NIH site subject 18 year age great . Locally determine positive test influenza A ( PCR , nucleic acid testing , rapid Ag ) specimen obtain less equal 48 hour prior randomization . Onset illness le equal 6 day randomization , define subject first experience least one respiratory symptom fever . Hospitalized due influenza , anticipate hospitalization 24 hour randomization . Criteria hospitalization individual treat clinician . Willingness blood respiratory sample obtain store . Willingness return require study visit participate study follow . NEW score great equal 3 within 12 hour prior randomization ( PEW [ pediatric early warning ] score great equal 3 within 12 hour prior randomization ) . ABOcompatible plasma available onsite available within 24 hour randomization . The subject able provide inform consent EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RANDOMIZATION : Subjects meet follow criterion exclude study participation : Strong clinical evidence judgment site investigator etiology illness primarily bacterial superinfection origin . Coinfection would allow , may benefit resolve influenza illness faster . Superinfection , influenza illness occur resolving , new bacterial illness cause deterioration exclude . Prior treatment antiinfluenza investigational drug , IVIG , plasma therapy within 30 day prior screen . Other investigational drug therapy ( noninfluenza ) allow . History allergic reaction blood plasma product ( judge site investigator ) . A preexist condition use medication , opinion site investigator , may place individual substantially increase risk thrombosis ( e.g. , cryoglobulinemia , severe refractory hypertriglyceridemia , clinically significant monoclonal gammopathy ) . Prior IVIG use alone would meet exclusion criterion , investigator consider potential hypercoagulable state . Subjects , judgment site investigator , unlikely comply requirement protocol , include uncontactable follow discharge hospital . Medical condition receipt 500600 mL intravenous fluid may dangerous subject ( e.g. , decompensated congestive heart failure ) . Women pregnant actively breast feeding ( NIH site ) .</criteria>
