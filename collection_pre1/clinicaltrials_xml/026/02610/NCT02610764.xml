	<brief_summary>To investigate feasibility evaluation prevalence clinical significance relevance circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) blood patient resectable adenocarcinoma esophagus ( EAC ) treat multimodal therapy pilot study . The primary hypothesis number CTC correlate tumor burden response treatment . One establish one experimental CTC detection platform investigate . Investigators evaluate prevalence enumeration CTC neoadjuvant treatment ( time point 1 ) , neoadjuvant treatment &amp; operation ( time point 2 ) operation ( time point 3 ) . Results compare healthy control ( one time point ) correlate conventional response treatment evaluation . The persistent presence CTC could marker bad response treatment predict early recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Sudy : Resectable Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Relevance CTC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little known prevalence clinical relevance CTC EAC , available data arise heterogeneous patient population use varied detection method ; promising tool improve stag prediction treatment response perioperative operative therapy . The limited report resectable EAC use epithelial-antibody dependent CellSearch method CTC isolation report CTC-positivity rate 15-18 % non-pre-treated patient clinical relevance . It thus need evaluate relevance CTC context multimodal treatment course . This pilot study investigate CTC blood patient resectable EAC treat multimodal therapy . Data prevalence enumeration CTC generate . Two CTC isolation method investigate , establish expensive surface-antibody-dependent CellSearch method , antibody-independent less expensive isolation size ( ISET ; ScreenCell ) method . The ISET method additionally investigate healthy control get data specificity . The study accomplish several goal use two CTC detection platform : 1 ) determine prevalence number CTC resectable EAC multimodal treatment , 2 ) investigate potential role CTC predict response treatment prognosis neoadjuvant treatment , neoadjuvant treatment operation well operation . The primary hypothesis enumeration CTC correlate tumor burden reflect response treatment . To date response treatment assessed combination CT-morphologic , endoscopic , clinical ( dysphagia ) finally histology . This assessment use control .</detailed_description>
