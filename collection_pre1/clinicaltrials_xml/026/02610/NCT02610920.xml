	<brief_title>Sentinel Lymph Node Identification Axilla Women With Breast Cancer Using Ultrasound Iron Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymph nod small collection tissue body drain bodily fluid . These axillary lymph node important evaluate breast cancer since , positive , suggest cancer cell spread outside breast . The current standard care breast cancer patient undergo surgery sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure take sample lymph node armpit ( also call axilla ) breast surgery . However intraoperative biopsy come certain risk arm swell lymphedema , arm pain , arm numbness/tingling , and/or psychological distress wait result possibility intervention . In order avoid result surgery , study explore nonsurgical method sample lymph node . Normally suspicious lymph node hard find accurately exam ultrasound . A new method develop involves inject small amount iron dissolve liquid breast get absorb lymph node make bright ultrasound possible biopsy . This method show result accurate standard sentinel lymph node biopsy compare operating room . This study investigate perform ultrasounds biopsy office well compare result result standard sentinel lymph node biopsy operating room . The result study could help future breast cancer patient avoid invasive sampling accompany risk well give patient care team idea extent disease sooner order guide management .</detailed_description>
