	<brief_summary>Understanding extent regional distribution CQR vivax malaria detect early sign resistance critical prevent spread resistant strain , optimize treatment guideline , reduce risk recurrent severe malaria . In Vietnam , CQR P.vivax report sporadically . One study carry Binh Thuan province ( central-south Vietnam ) end 1990s demonstrate early P.vivax recurrence ( 7 % ) Day 16 3-day CQ treatment . However , summary report World Health Organization ( WHO ) include data 11 sentinel site , study conduct 2006 2011 central southern Vietnam ( total 350 patient ) , P.vivax still consider sensitive CQ . More recently cohort study conduct Quang Nam province ( Central Vietnam ) P.vivax patient treat radically CQ primaquine ( 10-day 0.5mg/kg/day ) follow national guideline , 28-day failure rate measure 3.45 % CQ blood concentration measure day recurrence ( &gt; 100ng/ml ) confirm resistance three patient . The current national guideline radical cure regimen P.vivax infection recommend 3 day CQ ( total 25 mg/kg body weight ( bw ) ) together 14 day primaquine 0.25 mg/kg bw/ day . The current WHO protocol recommend 28-day follow-up ass efficacy CQ treatment P.vivax infection . However , recurrence early stage resistant parasite may occur Day 28 presence CQ blood level minimum efficacy concentration ( MEC , ≥100ng/ml ) relapse could occur early 36 day standard CQ treatment . Therefore , order confirm CQR recommend extend follow-up period , Day 42 63 measure whole blood CQ level Day 28 time recurrence . Moreover , show emerge drug resistance P.vivax associate delay parasite clearance treatment , i.e . parasite still detectable Day 3 . The aim present study ass vivo ex vivo susceptibility P.vivax CQ Central Vietnam follow currently recommend radical cure regimen use GMP certify CQ .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3.1 Study Design This study design 42-day drug efficacy study evaluate clinical parasitological response treatment P.vivax malaria infection . Symptomatic patient P. vivax mono-infections , meeting study criterion , enrol study , treat CQ ( total dose 25gm/kg 3 day ) . The treatment directly observe patient actively followed-up 42 day accord extend WHO protocol . At end follow-up time , patient treat primaquine following national guideline radical cure P.vivax infection . 3.2 Study Site Population The study carry Krong Pa district , Gia Lai province P.falciparum P.vivax malaria incidence among high country . The study locate Chu ' R Cam commune study team work local health staff surround commune malaria patient . The local population mainly compose JaRai ethnic minority main occupation consist slash burn agriculture ( mainly maize , manioc rice ) forest field , together seasonal work rubber plantation , small-scale production good daily subsistence trade e.g . coffee cashew nut . The climate tropical dry season November April rainy season May October . The area hilly forest ( secondary forest ) main malaria vector Anopheles dirus . 3.4 Trial Population The target population include P.vivax infected patient ( child adult ) either present spontaneously CHC identify active screening community . 3.5 Trial Procedures 3.5.1 Screening recruitment All consult patient meet basic enrolment criterion screen assigned consecutive screening number evaluate great depth medical doctor . Once patient meet enrolment criterion , ( parent guardian case child ) ask consent participate study . Then , he/she allocate study number ( ID=sequential number ) . Any person decide participate study examine , treat followed-up health facility staff accord standard care establish Ministry Health . At enrolment ( Day 0 ) patient examine standardized pre-coded questionnaire fill . A venous blood sample collect sterile vacutainer tube contain EDTA acid-citrate-dextrose ( EDTA/ACD ) patient enrolment . A minimum 5ml blood -and maximum 8 ml- collect adult , 1ml/kg 5ml collected child . Two blood drop add 1.5 ml tube contain 500 µL RNAprotect reagent ( Qiagen ) . 3.5.2 Treatment All patient receive full treatment CQ dose 25 mg CQ base per kg body weight ( bw ) give 3 day direct supervision . Patients observe 60 minute treatment adverse reaction vomit . Those patient vomit medication within first 30 minute receive repeat full dose ; vomit 30-60 minute receive half dose . If patient vomit , withdrawn offer rescue therapy . Rescue Medication : Oral=CQ ( 3 day , 25mg/kg ) together primaquine ( 0.25mg/kg/day 14 day ) ; Intravenous ( IV ) = Artesunate ( 4mg/kg/day ) minimum 24h patient able take oral drug . Then continue oral DHA-PPQ 3days . Radical cure . primaquine treatment delayed end follow , give recommend national guideline , i.e . 0.25mg/kg/day 14 day patient negative G6PD rapid test . 3.5.3 Follow From Day 0 parasite clearance patient monitor every 12 hour blood microscopy least Day 3 longer necessary parasite clearance define two consecutive negative slide . At visit , patient interview examined finger prick blood sample collect follow outcome : two blood slide LM observation ( thick thin film ) , 200μl blood EDTA/ACD microtainer tube DNA extraction , 2 drop blood another microtainer tube contain RNAprotect RNA extraction . At Day 3 , additional drop blood take measure Hb concentration Hemocue method . Day 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 Patients interview examined , follow-up form complete , adverse event document . A finger prick blood sample collect follow outcome : two blood slide LM observation ( thick thin film ) , 200μl blood EDTA/ACD microtainer tube DNA extraction , 2 drop blood RNAprotect contain microtainer tube . In addition , Day 7 , 100μl blood take filter paper determine blood CQ concentration . At Days 7 , 14 , 28 , 42 Hb concentration ( Hemocue ) measure finger prick . Day P.vivax recurrence : If recurrence confirm venous blood sample collect prior rescue treatment administration . 100μl venous blood spot filter paper determine blood CQ concentration , remain use ex vivo assay cryopreservation detail Annex VI-C. 3.5.4 Loss follow-up protocol violation Loss follow-up occurs , despite reasonable effort , enrol patient attend schedule visit find . No treatment outcome assign patient . These patient classify lose follow-up censor excluded analysis . Study patient meet follow criterion classify withdrawn : ) withdrawal consent ; ii ) failure complete treatment ; iii ) serious adverse event necessitate termination treatment full course complete ; iv ) enrolment violation ; v ) voluntary protocol violation ; vi ) involuntary protocol violation 3.5.5 Laboratory procedure evaluation Microscopy Three slide ( thin/thick blood smear ) obtain screen , one stain rapidly ( 10 % Giemsa 10 min ) examination limit number field ensure presence P.vivax asexual form minimum parasitaemia 250/ul . Once patient enrol , two slide stain carefully ( 3 % Giemsa 45 min ) . Density , express number asexual parasite per µl blood , calculate divide number asexual parasites number WBCs count correct estimate WBCs density ( typically 8000 per µl ) . When asexual parasite count le 10 per 200 WBCs , count do least 500 WBCs . A blood slide consider negative examination 1000 WBCs reveals asexual parasite . - Ring stage parasitaemia : The number ring stage count positive slide Day 0 Day recurrence 200 asexual parasite ; isolate proportion ring stage exceed 65 % use ex vivo drug assay . - Gametocytes : density compute count number gametocyte per 500 WBCs . Haemoglobin level Hb level measure whole blood collect micro-cuvette use Hemocue follow manufacturer instruction . Measurement CQ concentration Day 7 day recurrence 100 µl blood expel onto chromatography paper ( 31ETCHR , Whatman ) Parasite molecular detection genotyping DNA extract ITM/NIMPE finger-prick blood sample collect microtainers . Molecular confirmation Plasmodium species Day 0 perform qPCR target 18S ribosomal gene . The qPCR method use identify quantify P. vivax infection Day 0 follow sample . P. vivax genotype identify PCR amplification 3 marker particularly effective finger-printing clinical trial ( MS16 , Pv3.2 msp1F3 ) follow capillary gel electrophoresis . RNA extraction RT-qPCR gametocytes RNA extract RNAprotect sample ITM/NIMPE use affinity column DNAse digestion genomic DNA . To detect quantify P. vivax gametocyte stage reverse transcription qPCR ( RT-qPCR ) target Pvs25 gene transcript do D0 follow-up sample . Drug resistance laboratory analysis ( Day 0 recurrence ) Briefly , blood centrifuge plasma store -20ºC . The upper part buffy coat remove carefully store -20ºC . Red blood cell ( RBCs ) resuspend PBS ( 1:1 ) leukocyte deplete use cellulose column ( Sigma ) . Filtered cell wash pellet measure resuspend 50 % hematocrite McCoy medium ( blood medium mixture , BMM , 4ml ) . Ex vivo drug sensitivity assay : Briefly , plat predosed 7-point 2-fold dilution CQ , PPQ , DHA quinine prepare follow WWARN procedure [ http : //www.wwarn.org/sites/default/files/INV08_PFalciparumDrugSensitivity.pdf ] . Minimal inhibitory concentration IC50 calculate use In Vitro Analysis Reporting Tool ( IVART ) develop online WWARN . G6PD deficiency test : patient test G6PD deficiency use point-of-care test CareStart ( Access Bio , New Jersey , USA ) PQ treatment . 4 . Quality Assurance Site monitor visit schedule regular basis .
