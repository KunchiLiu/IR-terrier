	<brief_summary>This study explore relationship skeletal muscle physical activity scoliosis patient provide insight etiology scoliosis potential way mitigate potential harm treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Treatment Activity Muscle Function Pediatric Patients With Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim include first , quantify posture physical activity patient community scoliosis treatment compare age-matched control . Patients undergo brace surgery scoliosis wear novel low-profile electronic monitor 4 day prior one year initiation treatment . Accelerometer data 4 activity monitor combine comprehensive profile daily activity , beyond typical pedometer . Analysis show participant 's % active time vs. static , % time sit vs. lie vs. stand vs. walking , total number step take per day , cadence walking activity bout . The amount total daily time spend lying , sit , stand , walk run quantified use specialized processing algorithm develop Mayo Clinic . Results compare group age- BMI-matched control patient heal forearm fracture . Second , determine change mechanical property paraspinal skeletal musculature ( muscle along spine ) scoliosis patient treatment brace spinal surgery . Shear Wave Elastography ( SWUE ) technique use ultrasound , non-invasive imaging technique , detect mechanical property tissue . Using SWUE , stiffness paraspinal muscle obtain acquire Shear modulus measurement , report kilo Pascal ( kPa ) unit . 10 measurement obtain muscle region interest ( ROI ) place display elastogram color map measurement obtain `` kPa '' value . A mean shear modulus stiffness obtain average 10 result . The measurement ROI derive use software build ultrasound equipment . The change paraspinal skeletal muscle stiffness assess compare normal control determine characteristic spinal musculature scoliosis patient impact treatment brace surgery .</detailed_description>

Three group 12 patient group total 36 patient , allow dropout test statistical significance three cohort ( Brace , Surgery Control group ) . Males females 9 to16 year age Scoliosis/Surgery group ; severe scoliosis curve require posterior spinal fusion surgery Scoliosis/Brace group ; scoliosis curve require brace treatment least next year The Control group age matched participant heal forearm fracture match case patient age , gender , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . These child consider normal subject accelerometer Shear Wave Elastography ( SWUE ) Patients underlying muscle condition neuromuscular scoliosis</criteria>
