	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) associate problem gait veer , difficulty turning , inability perceive doorway obstacle , negotiate uneven terrain . Gait problem , especially veer , may exacerbate visuospatial dysfunction predispose fall , freeze festination gait . Visuospatial dysfunction common PD likely involve peripheral feature ( e.g . contrast sensitivity ) well central cognitive mechanism ( e.g . attention ) . Central neuro-degeneration PD , PD dementia , dementia Lewy Bodies may influence visual function , impaired visual sampling report condition . Visual sampling measure via saccadic ( fast eye movement ) activity , saccades mechanisms people orientate explore environment . The use objective device reliably measure saccades important detect disease relate eye movement change . Emerging visuomotor research measure visual sampling PD use device electrooculography infra-red eye tracking , reveal reduce amplitude , speed frequency saccades various task . Despite recent increase visuomotor research remain unclear PD influence visual sample environment gait influence attentional cognitive deficit . Recent work demonstrate people PD sample environment less frequently control , despite slow gait . Saccadic time unchanged response environmental cue . Despite , environmental visual cue ( transverse line floor ) show increase number fixation make gait . However mechanisms response remain unclear . Cognition likely importance , response potentially influenced attentional control . This observational study aim examine influence cognition visuomotor control gait PD . This aim achieve observation visual sampling several environmental challenge ( straight walk , doorway , turn , visual cue ) dual task .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visual Function During Gait Parkinson 's Disease : Impact Cognition Response Visual Cues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study visual sample gait different environmental challenge ( straight , doorway , turn visual cue ( transverse line floor ) ) dual task . These condition represent everyday activities/environments difficult people PD . This interventional study participant assign specific intervention researcher , follow re-assess outcome reliability test eye-tracking device use . The study ethically approve ( NRES Committee North East - Newcastle &amp; North Tyneside 1 : 13/NE/0128 ) observational study participant assign pre-defined group , behavioural measure ( primarily visual sample secondly gait ) observe gait laboratory various walk condition common everyday environment . Study Hypotheses The over-arching hypothesis observational study visual sample gait PD influence cognitive impairment . This study hypothesise saccadic activity restrict PD compare control gait . Dual task environmental challenge via doorway , turn visual cue influence saccadic activity gait . Specific study hypothesis : 1 . Cognition selectively impact visuomotor control gait 2 . Visual sampling strategy gait relate selected domain cognitive impairment Secondary question include : 1 . Is Dikablis mobile eye-tracker reliable mean measure saccadic activity PD healthy control ? After undergo screen confirm eligibility , subject assign one two group : 1 . Older adult control ( HC ; n = 40 ) 2 . People PD ( n = 60 ) Recruitment Participants recruit Movement Disorder Clinics Newcastle upon-Tyne . Research personnel available clinic require invite participant consider study . If sufficiently interested , participant give Participant Information Sheet ( PIS ) letter concern study . The invitation follow telephone call week ass willingness participate . If willing , mutually convenient time assessment organise , invitation attend extend carer spouse . The healthy control group recruit via advertisement use poster , place within neurology geriatric department . The advertisement also send via university email system staff student Newcastle University , recipient advise pas poster potential interested party ( i.e . family friend ) . All participant evaluate Clinical Ageing Research Unit , Newcastle University , purpose-build research facility . Testing Protocol Session 1 ; ( 150min ) - Initial screen baseline assessment ( 45-60min ) - Visual sampling gait ( 60-90min ) Session 2 ; ( 60min ) • 1st Reliability test ( 45-60min ) ( applicable ; subgroup PD HC participant ) Session 3 ; ( 60min ) • 2nd Reliability test ( 45-60min ) ( applicable ; subgroup PD HC participant ) Visual sample gait ( session 1 ) Participants ( n=100 ) assess gait laboratory clinical age research unit ( CARU ) , walk different condition , example single task , dual task , doorway , whilst turn visual cue ( transverse line floor 50cm apart ) place . Visual sampling assess Dikablis head-mounted eye track electrooculography ( EOG ) system . Gait simultaneously assess use 3D motion capture system ( Vicon ) , synchronise eye track system provide simultaneous data collection . Infra-red marker tap body limbs subject use small amount double-sided tape , allow motion tracking . The Dikablis also tap forehead participant use small amount double sided tape . Reliability test ( subgroup ) ( session 2 3 ) In order examine test re-test reliability mobile eye-tracking people PD healthy control , subgroup participant ( PD HC ; n=25 ) return second ( within approx . 1 week ) third visit . They ask repeat walk task outline sit ( chin rest ) , stand walk ( treadmill ) perform several eye movement visual target ( horizontal vertical visual angle ; 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 degree ) time auditory cue ( 60bpm metronome ) . Participants return third visit approx . 1 week second visit repeat reliability test ( ) . Sample Size This exploratory study therefore specific previous example available guide sample size require . The sample size estimate base result previous work research area ( PD ; n=21 ) ( Galna et al. , 2012 ) , previous similar study preliminary pilot work Dikabilis mobile eye-tracker , new instrument . Similar study research area use similar sample size ( n=2-26 ) , demonstrate difference PD HC group evident . Statistical Analysis Analysis Common Studies Statistical analysis undertaken use SPSS version 19 recent version ( SPPS , Inc. IBM company ) . Data check data collect carry independently two member Human Movement Science Team Clinical Ageing Research Unit ensure data accurate . All statistical test carry 5 % two-sided level significance . Demographic characteristic baseline data summarize use descriptive statistic , include mean , standard deviation , median , minimum , maximum inter-quartile range continuous ordinal data percentage categorical data . The descriptive statistic tabulate present graphically clarity.The assessment record pre-testing take baseline value . One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test use check normally distribute data . Non-normally distributed continuous distribution transform appropriate meet requirement parametric test ; otherwise equivalent non-parametric test adopt . Further Analysis To analyse visual sample gait Pearson 's correlation use test strength direction relationship clinical , gait saccadic outcome . Analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use analyse effect group ( PD , HC ) , dual task ( single task , dual task ) environmental challenge ( Straight walk , Door , Turn , Visual cue ) visual sample gait . To analyse reliability repeated-measure t-tests , Bland Altman plot , intra-class correlation coefficient ( Model 2 , 1 ) Pearson correlation ( non-parametric equivalent ) use assess bias , agreement consistency saccadic outcome measure Dikablis eye-tracker two separate occasion week apart .</detailed_description>
