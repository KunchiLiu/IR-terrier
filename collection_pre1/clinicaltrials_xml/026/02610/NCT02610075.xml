	<brief_summary>This Phase Ib study identify Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) AZD1775 monotherapy administer orally daily ( QD ) two time per day ( BID ) Days 1 5 follow 9 day rest 14-day cycle , QD 5/2 dose schedule ( 5 day , follow 2 day rest ) 21-day cycle patient locally advance metastatic solid tumour . Alternative treatment schedule may explore preliminary data suggest would appropriate . The effect food single dose PK AZD1775 assess 12 patient . In sub-study , patient receive single oral dose AZD1775 240 mL water , fast state follow high-fat meal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib Study Determine MTD AZD1775 Monotherapy Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumours .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct two part - designate Part A Part B . Part A attempt determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) /Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RP2D ) AZD1775 monotherapy administer orally daily ( QD ) two time per day ( BID ) Days 1 5 follow 9 day rest 14-day cycle , QD 5/2 dose schedule ( 5 day , follow 2 day rest ) 21-day cycle patient locally advance metastatic solid tumour . Both QD 5/9 5/2 dosing schedule run parallel . An evaluation make second QD cohort complete determine whether proceed one dosing schedule . The AZD1775 MTD determine dose-escalation use 3+3 cohort design . If less one-third evaluable patient give cohort ( 0 3 patient 1 6 patient ) experience Dose-Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) ; escalation may proceed next high dose level . If one first 3 patient enrol give cohort experience DLT , 3 additional patent enrol cohort . If DLT observe one-third patient , dose occurs consider tolerated MTD exceed . The high dose level ( ) less one-third patient ( 0 3 patient 1 6 patient ) experience DLT declare MTD . Up 6 patient enrolled cohort . Dose escalation continue identification MTD Sponsor termination study . A minimum 12 participant enrol treated QD MTD/RP2D safety evaluation . Of , minimum 6 participant assess food effect prior expansion dose level Part B . Assuming maximum 6 QD dose escalation cohort , approximately 48 evaluable subject expect enrol treated QD dose escalation portion study ; include subject BID dose escalation cohort approximately 60 evaluable subject may include . Further , additional 12 subject evaluate safety MTD/RP2D dose QD portion study . Approximately 6 subject may add replace non-evaluable patient . Therefore , total 78 patient expect treated Part A. Dose-limiting toxicity evaluate Cycles 1 2 treatment . If appropriate DLT observation period expand 2 week case treatment delay due study drug-related adverse event . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) version 4.03 . Patients must complete Cycle 1 Cycle 2 safety evaluation conclude Cycle 3 Day 1 , must receive least 80 % plan dose consider evaluable . Patients receive less 80 % Cycle 1 Cycle 2 dose ( 28 day ) replace unless experience confirmed DLT . The patient population use determine MTD consist patient meet minimum safety evaluation requirement study , and/or experienced DLT Cycle 1 Cycle 2 . Minimum safety requirement meet Cycle 1 Cycle 2 treatment patient receive minimum 80 % treatment dose AZD1775 , complete safety evaluation , observe least 28 day . Patients meet minimum safety evaluation treatment requirement experience DLT replace . The dose expansion part study ( Part B ) explore efficacy safety RP2D AZD1775 monotherapy ovarian cancer patient confirm BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation . Approximately 20 ovarian cancer patient progress PARP-inhibitor enrol . Patients allow continue treatment AZD1775 evidence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , discontinuation criterion occur .</detailed_description>
