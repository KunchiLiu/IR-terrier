	<brief_summary>The purpose study empower adolescent renal transplant recipient fully understand medical condition well help acquire skill maintain healthy allograft well adulthood . It hop introduce technological application ( apps ) assist adolescent manage medication , clinic appointment , lab appointment , track fluid intake , blood pressure , caloric intake , exercise frequency . The investigator aim improve adolescent post-renal transplant outcome ( increase medication adherence , low clinic laboratory no-show rate , low blood pressure BMI , maintain creatinine clearance , decrease proteinuria , decrease incidence allograft rejection , decrease hospitalization ) well reduce cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research team well principal investigator identify verify patient eligibility . Patients unable speak converse via sign language exclude . All participant need provide inform write consent . For recruitment inform consent , expect benefit , risk , uncertainty discuss participant family . Participants offer enrollment either randomize trial concurrent observational cohort , may feasible family live away alternative insurance plan ( Kaiser ) . The result concurrent observational cohort report late time . Enrollment begin April 2015 end April 2016 . This ensure patient may miss appointment still recruit following month . Baseline variable collect prior randomization include questionnaire baseline characteristic age , creatinine , weight , height , BMI , urine protein-to-creatinine ratio , donor specific antibody level , blood pressure record . Blood draw do per standard care blood sample store research purpose . Computer-generated random treatment assignment make base permuted block ( randomly generate block 3 ) . The experimental arm participant attend monthly renal transplant adolescent clinic participant undergo 25-question baseline questionnaire focus participant 's current knowledge medical condition , medication , medication dosage , insurance coverage , daily fluid goal , blood pressure goal , void schedule , etc . During clinic visit , participant take questionnaire review result transplant/research coordinator . The transplant/research coordinator also assist participant updating medication list , medication schedule , lab schedule , clinic appointment schedule , pharmacy refill schedule etc . use electronic device downloadable mobile apps . The included apps MyFitnessPal , calorie counter exercise tracker , Blood Pressure Lite ( Codulis ) blood pressure recording , Med Coach ( GreatCall , Inc ) , provide medication appointment reminder . If participant already personal i-Phone , study coordinator assist participant add schedule calendar help set alarm reminder . The research coordinator also help download free mobile apps log BP , fluid intake , caloric intake , exercise duration . If participant i-Phone , i-Pad Mini provide transplant coordinator assist state . The participant see nephrologist , social worker , psychologist . The non-technological group participant also attend monthly renal transplant adolescent clinic he/she undergo 25-question baseline questionnaire . During clinic visit , participant take questionnaire review result research coordinator . The transplant coordinator also assist participant updating medication list , medication schedule , lab schedule , clinic appointment schedule , pharmacy refill schedule etc . use paper calendar pre-printed paper log per routine care protocol . The participant also see nephrologist , social worker , psychologist . The primary measure performance monthly medical knowledge questionnaire , use surrogate marker readiness transition adult care . Secondary measure include medication adherence measure immunosuppression target drug level , clinic laboratory no-show rate , marker graft function measure blood pressure reading , BMI , creatinine clearance , urine protein-to-creatinine ratio , episodes rejection measure donor specific antibody , pathologic finding allograft biopsy . The study end one year follow period complete . As paper-based strategy function control , investigator anticipate early termination study , particularly since group provide intervention current standard care .</detailed_description>
