	<detailed_description>This study divide 2 phase : provider training ( Phase 1 ) patient level intervention ( Phase 2 ) . Phase 1 , provider training , manage administrative grant Johns Hopkins . Providers notify research project locally train assessment Johns Hopkins . Phase 1 : Training provider offer alcohol pharmacotherapy ( APT ) at-risk drinker interested quit reduce drink part overall HIV care could important strategy reduce hazardous alcohol use medically-ill population . However , unknown Infectious Disease provider feel treat alcohol use disorder within HIV clinic . Further uncertain specific provider clinic barrier implement type program primary care set . A web-based alcohol pharmacotherapy provider training provide across Center AIDS Research ( CFAR ) Network Integrated Clinical Systems ( CNICS ) , national network 8 clinical cohort . At two intervention site ( University Alabama Birmingham University Washington ) , provider receive on-site training addition web-based training alcohol pharmacotherapy administer 8 site . The follow specific aim project : Aim 1 : To evaluate provider attitude alcohol pharmacotherapy training . Aim 2 : To determine barrier facilitator alcohol treatment implementation HIV specialty clinic . Phase 2 : Determine effectiveness computer-delivered brief intervention ( CBI ) reduce hazardous drinking HIV clinical care set two intervention clinic : University Alabama Birmingham ( UAB ) University Washington ( UW ) . The combination CBI plus alcohol pharmacotherapy ( APT ) provider training ( Phase 1 ) pilot two clinic Center AIDS Research ( CFAR ) Network Integrated Clinical Systems ( CNICS ) , national network 8 clinical cohort . Across 8 CNICS site , patient screen hazardous binge drinking use AUDIT ( Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ) MINI ( Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview ) instrument . At UAB UW , patient screen eligible ( self-report hazardous binge drinking use AUDIT MINI instrument ) approach participation . The data collect protocol use compare Standard Care note Aim 2 . Standard Care UAB include potential referral in-house substance abuse program outside agency , base provider 's discretion . Providers option offer alcohol pharmacotherapy use date routinely . Specific aim proposal : Aim 1 : Develop tailored CBI intervention address alcohol risk specific HIV-infected patient . Aim 2 : Compare effectiveness CBI + APT versus standard care reduce alcohol use among hazardous drink HIV infected individual . Aim 3 : Determine patient-level predictor CBI APT engagement effectiveness . Aim 4 : Determine facilitator barrier successful integration implementation intervention HIV clinical setting .</detailed_description>
