	<brief_title>Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EoE ) Intervention Trial-Randomized 1 Food Elimination vs. 4 Food Elimination Diet Followed Swallowed Glucocorticoids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist two phase , plus screening period . During screen period , subject eligibility study determine . During Phase 1 , qualify participant randomly assign one two elimination diet therapy -- 1FED 4FED . Participants remain assigned dietary therapy 12 week . At end 12 week therapy , esophageal biopsy participant 's standard care ( i.e . normal , routine care ) endoscopy evaluate determine disease status . Participants whose EoE remission ( i.e . &lt; 15 eos/hpf ) do study . Participants whose EoE still active ( i.e . ≥15 eos/hpf ) continue Phase 2 study . During Phase 2 , participant 1FED Phase 1 receive 4FED therapy 12 week , participant 4FED Phase 1 receive swallow glucocorticoid therapy 12 week . At end 12 week therapy , esophageal biopsy participant 's standard care ( i.e . normal , routine care ) endoscopy evaluate determine disease status .</detailed_description>
