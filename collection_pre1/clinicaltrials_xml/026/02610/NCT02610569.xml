	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) inflammatory bowel disease progress flare-up . The therapeutic objective , originally base clinical remission , currently evolve development biotherapies towards achievement endoscopic remission . Current recommendation therapeutic management advocate achievement endoscopic mucosal healing ( EMH ) , observed decrease necessity colectomy case EMH . Endoscopic evaluation severity UC perform digestive endoscopy ( colonoscopy complete colonic exploration , recto-sigmoidoscopy partial exploration colon ) endoscopic activity score adapt UC . Currently , score commonly use MAYO endoscopic score . This global score increase intensity 0 3 , take account follow basic lesion : vascular pattern , granularity or/and friability mucosa , spontaneous bleeding , erosion ulceration . However score limit : distinguish deep cavitating ulceration mucous detachment simple ulceration good prognosis . A new endoscopic score specific UC develop currently validate . It term Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index Severity ( UCEIS ) . This evaluation take account three reproducible factor - vascular pattern , presence bleeding , erosion ulceration include cavitating ulceration - total score . To ensure optimal patient care adaptation therapeutic medical care endoscopic severity disease , endoscopic exploration perform recurrently . However , exploration invasive procedure , require general anaesthesia colonoscopy , lead potential complication perforation . This explain poor acceptance patient , result sub-optimal therapeutic support .</brief_summary>
