	<detailed_description>The study conduct longitudinal study , combine qualitative quantitative perspective , i.e . mixed-methods design . The rationale combining quantitative qualitative method provide comprehensive exploration research question.Investigators conduct interview close meeting room hospital , three month participant´s first hospital visit . The time span set allow participant conclude treatment care touch . The interview , last 60 minute , conduct Swedish , digitally record transcribed verbatim investigator . An open-ended question use initiate interview . The quantitative primary outcome current level pain measure VAS , range 0 ( pain ) 100 ( worst imaginable pain ) . Participants rat current VAS pain baseline initial visit treatment session care touch , via postal follow-up six month . Secondary exploratory outcome sense coherence ( SOC ) , construct Antonovsky basis salutogenic model . The Sense Coherence scale interest since instrument capture participant ' experience comprehensibility , manageability , meaningfulness assume could link participant recovery . SOC , 13-item rating scale , develop use subscales comprehensibility , manageability , meaningfulness . Total score 21-59 indicate low sense coherence , 60-74 average sense coherence , 75-91 high sense coherence . Additionally , Impact Event Scale ( IES-R ) well use previous trauma research decide appropriate tool explore extent participant experience post-traumatic stress disease . IES-R , 22-item scale show degree traumatic experience felt consciousness level , person exhibit avoidant behaviour . The IES-R base 4-point frequency scale ( i.e. , 0=not , 1= little bit , 2= moderately , 3=quite bit , 4=extremely ) . An average total scale sum 1.8-2.0 indicate post-traumatic stress disorder . The IES-R seem solid measure post-traumatic phenomenon augment relate assessment approach clinical research context . The European Quality Life ( EQ-5D ) instrument employ explore participants´ health-related quality life self-related health . The EQ-5D instrument select short-form widely use measure quality life among County Councils Sweden . EQ-5D standardized instrument measure health outcome . Participants classify health term five dimension : mobility , self-care , usual activity , pain/discomfort , anxiety/depression . Each dimension three level severity : ( 1 ) problem , ( 2 ) moderate problem , ( 3 ) severe problem . From sum number total 243 combination health create . Each health combination generate index value -0.59 1.0 , 1.0 indicate full health . Additionally , EQ-5D visual analogue scale self-rated health anchor zero ( bad imaginable health ) 100 ( best imaginable health ) . Data VAS pain rating questionnaires manually transfer paper electronic database statistical analysis . Summary characteristic participant present proportion , mean , median , standard deviation and/or min-max value . Change score VAS pain rating , SOC , IES-R EQ-5D time baseline follow-up six month analyse patient complete data . Considering rating scale ordinal type data , relatively small sample size , non-parametric statistical analysis , i.e . Wilcoxon signed-rank test employ assess change score time . All p-value calculation conduct 5 % significance level . An additional descriptive analysis conduct VAS pain rating treatment session care touch . Computational software include STATA 13 , StataCorp , USA Microsoft Excel 2011 , Microsoft , USA .</detailed_description>
