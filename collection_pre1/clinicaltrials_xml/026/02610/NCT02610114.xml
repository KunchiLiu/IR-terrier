	<brief_title>Improvement Cell Selection Reproductive Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It aim trial use new computerized selection method , addition current world-wide use score system fertilize oocyte ( zygote ) implement Scott 1998 , determine whether lead increase pregnancy rate woman undergo assisted reproductive technique . If successful could future lead reduction number embryos require achieve pregnancy . Transferring one embryo mean minimize incidence high order multiple pregnancy . Regularly couple gain several fertilize oocyte ( zygote ) due artificial reproductive technique . As routine , cell archive use picture videos quality safety reason different stage development . Because plan transfer one two develop embryo uterus , investigator select zygotes high potential implantation pregnancy . The remain cell preserve use vitrification . In study , investigator use addition establish Zygote-score ( Z-score ) Scott new selection method one group patient : The quality zygotes patient classify accord describe Scott system . Patients randomize two group . Group 1 control group without intervention . If need selection , quality zygotes patient group 2 additionally score new method . The picture cell , already take quality safety reason , take cell surface analyse use computer algorithm .</detailed_description>

Investigator 's judgement Expectation life 18 year Risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Avital cell ( cell develop die ) Treatment due fertility preservation , e.g . case cancer Problems stimulation follicle puncture Endometrial pathology like polyp , submucous fibroid , etc . Any preceding stimulation cycle endometrial thickness 6mm Less 4 fertilize oocyte Patient ( partner ) wish single embryo Transfer Failure become pregnant new zygote selection method</criteria>
