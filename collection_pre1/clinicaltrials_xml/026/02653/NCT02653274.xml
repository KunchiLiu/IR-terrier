	<brief_summary>Breakfast porridge make milled grain commonly eat worldwide . Traditionally different grain use different country . For example , oats common Anglo-Saxon country ; rye favour Scandinavian country whilst millet common part India Africa . However nutritional value potential metabolic health effect may vary dramatically different grain . For example effect different grain blood sugar fast stomach empty eat porridge full people feel . All physiological response may differ grain result potential health benefit . RESEARCH QUESTION : The investigator hypothesise porridge make different grain behave differently digestion cause difference blood glucose level , gastric empty appetite . This study , 4-way , randomize , cross pilot study healthy participant , aim answer research question . The participant ask eat porridge breakfast make oat , rye millet different variety ( contain amount calorie ) , 4 morning study one week apart . MRI use monitor gastrointestinal fate breakfast measure gastric empty use MRI , blood glucose level use finger prick test self-reported appetite score .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Porridge breakfast various grain staple source energy many population worldwide . The grain use porridge differ region , mostly due crop historically grow . For example , oats common Anglo-Saxon country ; rye traditional Scandinavian country whilst millet common part India Africa . Porridge consumption popular : 78 % South Africans eat porridge ; 49 % British people eat porridge 23 % almost daily ; 62 % U.S. households buy hot cereal breakfast hot cereal segment best performer within breakfast cereal market UK . Consumption whole grain associate variety health benefit range low blood glucose level , improve insulin response , reduce cholesterol increase diversity microbiota . Of particular interest study recent suggestion different grain , particularly millet grain , may enhance health benefit glucose insulin metabolism . This may due different rate digestion absorption , example , grain specific difference starch digestibility . This could affect gastric emptying , turn , post prandial glycaemia impact satiety . However little know possible difference gastric empty breakfast porridge different grain possible relationship glucose , insulin appetite . The hypothesis underlie study porridge make different grain ( oat , rye different millet ) produce different postprandial glucose level correlate gastric empty appetite healthy volunteer participant . Aims : 1. collect pilot data postprandial glucose level isoenergetic breakfast porridge make different grain , oat , rye millet different origin . 2. collect initial pilot data gastric empty satiety . 3. compare postprandial glucose level , gastric empty satiety different treatment 4. explore relationship glucose level , gastric empty satiety . Experimental protocol method : 16 healthy volunteer participate 4-way study . They attend one morning study , study separate 1 week . Before test meal , approximately every 15 min 1 hour approximately every 20 minute 1 hour level glucose blood measure use finger prick method , diabetic commonly monitor blood sugar . The participant also scan baseline , immediately test meal every hour 2 hour postprandially . Subjects scan research dedicate 1.5T MRI scanner . At baseline every time subject provide blood glucose sample participant ask rate feeling fullness , hunger appetite 100mm VAS scale . The subject fed four isoenergetic breakfast porridge : Oat , Rye , Pearl ( Bajra ) millet Finger ( Ragi ) millet porridge source supermarket food shop . These cooked water avoid confound factor milk . The test breakfast 220 kcal . Statistical power . This pilot study .</detailed_description>
