	<detailed_description>Tinnitus phantom auditory perception sound absence external internal acoustic stimulus . It frequent problem interfere significantly ability lead normal life . Tinnitus show generate brain , result functional reorganization auditory non-auditory neural pathway . Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) apply temporoparietal area investigate treatment tinnitus base rationale reduce increase activity auditory system . Furthermore , high-frequency stimulation leave frontal cortex add standard treatment base rTMS study affective disorder association tinnitus distress depressivity . Thus , high-frequency stimulation leave prefrontal cortex low-frequency stimulation bilateral temporoparietal cortex introduce new treatment scheme chronic tinnitus ( multisite standard ) . Additionally , also evidence high-frequency stimulation temporoparietal cortex effective chronic tinnitus . Furthermore , standard treatment chronic tinnitus two week ( ten treatment day ) shorter standard rTMS affective disorder . Thus , aim present trial investigate influence high-frequency stimulation temporoparietal cortex increase number treatment day . Patients receive two week treatment ( prefrontal high-frequency bilateral low-frequency rTMS vs. prefrontal high-frequency bilateral high-frequency rTMS ) . After two week treatment decide want quit treatment want proceed treatment another two week .</detailed_description>
