	<brief_title>SBRT Organ Confined Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation option treat early stage prostate cancer include external radiation therapy , radiation give outside body , prostate seed implant , place radioactive seed directly prostate . For external beam radiation therapy , treatment last 9 week . Treatment give daily , Monday Friday . This may convenient option patient . One way potentially overcome challenge deliver intense dose radiation treatment tumor shorter amount time . Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) technique treat prostate few treatment decrease effect radiation surround tissue . This study Phase I research study , mean look safety dose SBRT . While SBRT standard care method administer radiation therapy , specific dose outline past . The aim study determine dose treat prostate cancer cause least amount side effect .</detailed_description>
