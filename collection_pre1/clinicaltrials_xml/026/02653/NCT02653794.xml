	<detailed_description>It report take period form 22 week pregnant first 45 month life macular region develop structural formation functional integrity . However , child still critical period plastic visual development , visual acuity yet reach level adult . Similarly macular retinal structure may develop age . It important study macular thickness period proper cognition relation macular thickness ocular parameter research retinal development disease early screen fundus disease . Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) image technique widely use clinic last twenty year . According base theory dim coherent light interference machine , OCT detect back-reflection scatter signal biological tissue incident dim coherent light , acquire two-dimension three- dimension image biological tissue scan . It enable characteristic tissue 's microstructure vivo make possible observe dynamically develop process diseases become essential test macular optic nerve disease unmatched measurement reproducibility . It also enable high-resolution noninvasive image retinal lamina , organizational structure macular . It often use clinically demonstrate macular morphology , treatment response disease progression clinically . However , researcher study OCT mostly patient retinal disease adult . There study focus OCT 's application child . In study , investigator aim measure macular thickness ( MT ) use spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) investigate MT variation sex , age , laterality , refraction error ( RE ) axial length ( AL ) .</detailed_description>
