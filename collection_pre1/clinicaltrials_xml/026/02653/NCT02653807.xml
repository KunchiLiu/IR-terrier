	<brief_summary>Ankle rigidity common musculoskeletal disorder affect talocrural joint , impair weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion ( WBADF ) . The objective compare efficacy Mulligan Mobilization Movement ( MWM ) Osteopathic Mobilization ( OM ) improve ankle dorsiflexion range motion ( ROM ) musculoarticular stiffness ( MAS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Manual Therapy Techniques Ankle Dorsiflexion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased musculoarticular stiffness ( MAS ) talocrural joint frequently encounter problem , identify evaluation weight bear ankle dorsiflexion ( WBADF ) . Such stiffness may follow ankle injury ankle sprain . In situation , MAS could increase might lead lack joint flexibility well decreased dorsiflexion range-of-motion ( ROM ) , however asymmetric rigidity necessarily always follow ankle sprain . Nevertheless , MAS important necessary component normal stability talocrural joint could help prevent abnormal ankle joint movement ankle sprain . Measurement MAS determine technique know free-oscillation , comprehensive measure joint stiffness comprise stiffness muscle-tendon unit , skin , ligament joint capsule , along number mechanical neuromuscular factor . The assessment MAS important evaluate muscular performance , injury prevention gender difference flexibility . For example , men , well old people , know present great MAS woman young people . MAS talocrural joint objectively measure use electromechanical device imparts passive oscillatory dorsiflexion movement , also mean clinical test toe-wall distance angular goniometric measurement weight bear lunge test . Electromechanical measurement ankle MAS use several previous study asymptomatic participant patient fibromyalgia syndrome , spasticity stroke . In orthopaedic manual therapy , different method propose treat MAS associate loss dorsiflexion ROM talocrural joint . These include single session Mulligan 's Mobilization Movement ( MWM ) , anteroposterior mobilization talus , high velocity thrust , Osteopathic Mobilization ( OM ) . These method describe clinical practice manual , great proportion study report effect MWM comparison high velocity thrust improve ankle dorsiflexion ROM chronic ankle instability study MWM efficacy isolation subacute recurrent ankle sprain chronic ankle instability . With exception one study result generally favor MWM . Generally MWM increasingly popular form manual therapy musculoskeletal disorder , concern ankle MWM try improve talocrural ROM . MWM combination accessory joint glide talus combine active ankle dorsiflexion movement . The patient performs active WBADF therapist simultaneously apply anteroposterior glide talus respective posteroanterior tibial glide aid manual therapy belt . OM purely passive anteroposterior mobilization talus respect tibia , perform non weight-bearing position . To date , study compare effectiveness technique respect electromechanically determine ankle MAS ankle joint ROM determine WBADF lunge test . Therefore , aim study investigate relative efficacy MWM OM MAS primary outcome measurement joint ROM WBADF lunge test secondary outcome measurement . The hypothesis MWM would produce significantly great reduction MAS increase ankle joint ROM compare OM .</detailed_description>
