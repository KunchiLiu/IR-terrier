	<brief_title>Implementation Realistic Simulation Patient Safety Improvement Method</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , issue patient safety hotly debate nationally internationally , relevant issue health professional ' practice improve quality patient care . According Institute Medicine ( IOM ) report release 2000 , significant number death hospital every year relate preventable cause medical error . These death equal mortality number due disease cancer HIV car acidentes . In scenario , death due error process care achieve world relevance 2002 , World Health Organization ( WHO ) release World Health Assembly ( WHA ) Resolution 55.18 , address priority relate patient safety quality care . In 2004 , create World Alliance Patient Safety occasion 57th World Health Assembly . The World Alliance define program patient safety must adopt member country therefore , Brazil . The general action propose WHO World Alliance Patient Safety orient five activity among , effort strengthen train patient safety worldwide . It stimulate inclusion curriculum guide patient safety health professional training course . Aspects patient safety medicine administration involve many health professional . However , nurse important role responsible administration thus , occupy last stage medication error . For reason , safety medication administration compulsory transversal theme training nursing professional . In context search improvement health care planning , new practice concept teach learn develop , aim training professional train health professional already graduate . Interests use realistic simulation technique emerge lately objective encourage improvement safety patient care . The simulation technique amplifies experience health professional educational action guide experience happen real world , therefore , interaction must happen way preserve realistic aspect possible . The adoption simulation health come successful reference use technique industrial purpose arm force . It consider innovative technique health . In high fidelity simulation , student professional experience clinical case replicate real-world scenario . This strategy enable teach innovation , improve clinical think stressful situation , prevents exposure patient risk . The realistic simulation integrate education nurse doctor last year , fully implement yet . Despite recommendation use simulation , increase integration education , concrete evidence use promote well prepare health professional performance clinical practice , empirical evidence impact patient outcome still develop . Besides realistic manikin-based simulation , virtual simulation another way simulation proven effective learning strategy , contribute retention knowledge improvement nursing student ' clinical performance . From increase use technology health complexity patient , new way learn shape developed innovative teach method health care . All alternative promise intention reduce deterioration learn clinical performance time , make professional student able monitor patient best possible way , establish goal , priority well treatment . An advantage possibility student practice skill environment mistake make correct without cause damage risk patient safety . In addition , construction knowledge establish representative situation day-to-day reality professional practice , student participate patient-actors totally control environment , well protected risk . At end activity , student and/or professional involve simulation give feedback learning , group discussion teacher , form knowledge base self-knowledge confidence . PURPOSE Primary purpose To compare use high fidelity simulation traditional education innovative method process teach learn . Secondary purpose To propose creation high fidelity scenario relate nursing care medication administration ; To identify gain theoretical practical learn self-confidence nursing undergraduate student undergoing high fidelity simulation medication administration ; To assess effectiveness efficiency use high fidelity simulation process teach learning .</detailed_description>
