	<brief_title>Glycemic Hormone Responses After Intake Four Types Bread .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The postprandial blood glucose concentration appear play critical role development diabetes cardiovascular disease ; largely influenced carbohydrate load meal . Thus , advocate carbohydrate ( CHO ) food promote favorable glycemic insulinemic response , maintenance satiety high long period , may beneficial approach many chronic disease . Bread basic food Italian feeding . The industrial production bread gradually replace craft production small bakery . It possible buy daily bread obtain complete bake carry directly point sale pre-cooked frozen dough . The use `` improver '' enzyme preparation alpha-amylase , improve quality bread . A study find trestatin , amylase inhibitor incorporate bread , produce low glycemic insulinemic response ; another report bread make ancient wheat Einkorn ( Triticum monococcum ) elicit reduced production glucose-dependent insulinotrophic polypeptide ( GIP ) . The objective present study determine glycemic insulinemic response ( area-under curve , AUCs ) , satiety rate AUCs free fatty acid ( FFA ) , triglycerides ghrelin ingestion four type bread , contain 50g available CHO : - 97 g handcraft bread make wheat organic flour ; - 97 g handcraft bread wheat flour large-scale retail distribution ; - 94 g handcraft bread organic einkorn flour - 86 g commercial precooked-frozen white bread . 16 healthy volunteer participate randomized cross-over trial . Each participant consume specific portion type bread morning , 8-12 h fasting . The 3 type bread consume participant order determine randomization procedure , week . At enrollment , participant meet inclusion criterion ( see ) . Nutrition exercise advice give day bread test . Participants consume bread portion 15 minute . Blood sample draw every 30-min fast 120-min bread consumption . The following variable evaluate time point : glucose , insulin , FFA , triglyceride , acylated ghrelin . The satiety rate estimate every 30-min Satiety Labeled Intensity Magnitude scale .</detailed_description>
