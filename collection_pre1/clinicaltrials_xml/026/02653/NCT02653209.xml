	<brief_summary>The aim project identify subgroups patient type 2 diabetes respond well poorly particular drug base particular clinical characteristic weight kidney function , enable well target treatment particular individual . This study test 2 hypothesis drug response support routine clinical trial data . 600 patient type 2 diabetes suboptimal glycaemic control dual oral therapy recruit randomised double-blind crossover study DPP4 inhibitor , SGLT2 inhibitor thiazolidinedione . Each patient take study drug addition exist treatment four month time . At end treatment patient 's glucose control measure information experience drug collect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TriMaster : Study DPP4 Inhibitor , SGLT2 Inhibitor Thiazolidinedione Third Line Therapy Patients With Type 2 Diabetes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study phase 4 randomised double-blind crossover study DPP4 inhibitor , SGLT2 inhibitor thiazolidinedione third line therapy patient Type 2 diabetes suboptimal glycaemic control dual therapy metformin sulphonylurea . 600 patient age 30-80 stable dos 2 class therapy ( include trial IMPs GLP1-agonist ) least 3 month HbA1c &gt; 58mmol/mol ( 7.5 % ) receive three double-blinded third-line non-injectable therapy . On recruitment study participant underlie pathophysiology assess mixed-meal tolerance test ( MMTT ) sample collect baseline analysis storage future biomarker analysis discovery . Participants receive 16 week over-encapsulated blind therapy random order . At end treatment period , fast blood take measure glycaemic response ( HbA1c ) , fast glucose insulin concentration trough drug level confirm continue eligibility . Weight , blood pressure . data patient experience also collect include perceived side effect , preparedness remain therapy , psychological health health relate quality life . At end study , patient treatment preference record feed back patient 3 therapy HbA1c , weight change , frequency hypoglycaemia , patient report side effect patient 's verdict therapy record . Each participant ask treatment would take long term reason preference .</detailed_description>
