	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) cluster metabolic condition associate obesity predispose individual coronary heart diseases diabetes obesity show increase risk diseases like cancer asthma . Studies also show obesity increase risk severe influenza infection associate death reduces efficacy influenza vaccine obese population yet , molecular mechanism describe . The investigator thus hypothesize difference innate immune response individual without metabolic syndrome impact viral infection vaccine outcome . The investigator perform seasonal influenza vaccination people without metabolic syndrome determine late adaptive response assess antibody titer different two group correlate early immune response assess gene expression profile whole blood cell . The project propose investigator contribute good understanding inflammatory phenotype associate metabolic syndrome establish first time affect immune protection infectious disease particularly influenza virus infection . The result important determine population affect metabolic syndrome receive anti-influenza treatment priority context severe influenza epidemic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The development industrialization increase food consumption sedentarity give rise obesity pandemic , affect 30 % population country like US , population great risk cardiovascular disease , diabetes . More obesity per se , visceral obesity associate metabolic disease cluster together clinically define metabolic syndrome . MetS comprise individual least three 5 follow factor : abdominal obesity , high blood triglyceride , low HDL ( `` good cholesterol '' ) , high blood pressure elevate fast glucose . Metabolic syndrome associate low-grade inflammation characterize infiltration immune cell particularly adipose tissue , liver pancreas think responsible induction insulin resistance . It think obesity predisposes diseases cancer , asthma little attention give infectious disease . Studies show obesity increase risk severe influenza infection associate death reduces efficacy influenza vaccine obese population yet , molecular mechanism describe . Immune dysfunction associate obesity suspect play major role obesity often associate respiratory disorder could directly explain increased susceptibility influenza infection . Also , metabolically healthy obesity less associated inflammation . Therefore , investigator would like focus particularly metabolic syndrome , determine influence immune response virus . The investigator thus hypothesize difference innate immune response individual without metabolic syndrome impact viral infection vaccine outcome . Recent study involve complex biological analysis computational model show ability individual positively respond influenza vaccine molecularly predict look marker blood cell . The investigator perform seasonal influenza vaccination people without metabolic syndrome determine late adaptive response assess antibody titer different two group correlate early immune response assess gene expression profile whole blood cell . Healthy nutritional habit along increased physical activity best prevent development metabolic syndrome socio-economical issue slow implementation change . Therefore , metabolic syndrome raise public health concern , important understand metabolic syndrome affect susceptibility disease .</detailed_description>
