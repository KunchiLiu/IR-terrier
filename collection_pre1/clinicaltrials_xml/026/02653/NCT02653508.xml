	<brief_title>Evaluating Efficacy Feeding Exercise Trial Adolescents ( FETA Project ) Central Greece</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : All student 15 public middle school city Larissa central Greece invite measure weight height , order calculate Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . All overweight obese student invite take part study . The participation free charge child . Parents informed purpose project ask provide write informed consent participation . The study 's protocol approve ethic committee Medical Department University Thessaly . One hundred eighty one adolescent enrol randomized three group study , professional teacher physical education conduct program . One hundred fifty remained end program 6-months follow include analysis . None subject organic cause his/her obesity none receive medication , would interfere growth weight control ( e.g . corticosteroid , thyroid hormone ) . Intervention : The FETA project involve one control two intervention group : Physical Activity Skill Development Program ( Activity ) combination Dietary Information Physical Activity Skill Development Program ( Diet Activity ) . Physical Activity Skill Development Program : All adolescent participate three-day per week training programme ( 45 minute per training session ) . Training direct professional teacher physical education public training centre . The training program design accord type intensity exercise school child normally perform . Many activity deliver game order encourage enthusiasm participation . Endurance type activity account time spend training ( 50 % team sport 50 % run game ) , attention coordination flexibility skill . In order encourage adolescent ' behaviour change , instruct add extra 30-45 minute walk sport activity preference least week reduce inactivity ( discourage television watch play video game encourage use stair instead lift play outdoors ) . Structured nutrition education : Additionally , train session , participant combine intervention attend structure nutrition educational program . In introductory meeting ( 45-60 minute ) general information present reason behind childhood obesity , dietary cooking habit motivation weight loss effort involve whole family `` battle '' obesity .

The topic discuss give adolescent form print notebook , parent also invite attend session . The discussion lead person perform training session . Outcome measure : All outcome measure take baseline every month end sixth month , 3-month follow period intervention end . 1 . Anthropometric measurement : Students weigh digital scale twice average record . Participants remove shoe jacket height weight measure . Participants ' height measure use metric measuring tape affixed wall . Body weight height measure use instrument , place day week , start day 's program . Non-extensible steel tape use assess waist circumference , measure level mid point low costal border iliac crest . All anthropometric measure conduct use International Society Advancement Kin anthropometry procedure . BMI determine accord follow formula : BMI= [ weight/height2 ] . We use cut point BMI childhood present Cole et al order allow international comparison finding prevalence overweight obesity . Pulses per minute measure use automate blood pressure monitor standardise procedure . 2 . Fitness assessment : Pre- post- intervention evaluation ( 3 6 month ) physical fitness base EUROFIT Tests Protocol design Committee Experts Sports Research use several European country . The 50m sprint Run Test use test evaluation speed . 3 . Family Eating Activity Habits Questionnaire : The modified version Family Eating Activity Habits Questionnaire ( FEAHQ ) complete parent adolescent . FEAHQ divide four subscales : activity level ( 4 item ) , stimulus exposure ( 8 item ) , eat relate hunger ( 4 item ) , eat style ( 13 item ) .

Finally , participant three groups- adolescent parents- ask discuss study experience completion follow , 6-months initiation study .</detailed_description>
