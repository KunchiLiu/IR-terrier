	<brief_title>The Effects Acute Caloric Deprivation Odour Identification Food Reward</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective current randomize controlled study examine modality acute 3 day isocaloric -25 % energy depletion diet alone aerobic exercise alone differently impact appetite appetite-related hormone , ad libitum energy intake ( EI ) , food hedonics food reward , olfaction . It hypothesize independent modality depletion , relative control , would increase ad libitum feed food reward , improvement smell performance , decline fasting leptin increase fast total ghrelin . It also hypothesize increase food reward would prove predictor ad libitum EI relative depletion aerobic exercise alone , depletion diet alone would produce great compensatory increase appetite , ad libitum EI , food reward . Statistics To test difference body weight , plasma hormone concentration , relative-reinforcing value food ( RRVF ) , olfaction across condition study , repeat measure ANOVA control day 1 covariate employ . Pairwise comparison day 4 use Sidak adjustment account multiple comparison report ANOVA significant . One way repeat measure ANOVAs Sidak adjustments multiple comparison use test difference variable measure day 4 : body composition ( fat ma , % Fat , fat free mass ) , appetite , palatability , ad libitum EI .</detailed_description>
