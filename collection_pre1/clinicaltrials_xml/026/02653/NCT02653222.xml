	<brief_summary>In study investigator go assess feasibility innovate technique renal sympathetic denervation translumbar access ct-guidance . To limit potential impact kidney , investigator choose population chronic renal failure patient dialysis renal transplant ( native kidney still present ) resistant treatment hypertension despite antihypertensive combination therapy well conduct . The investigator expect obtain decrease blood pressure 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) one month sympathetic denervation .</brief_summary>
