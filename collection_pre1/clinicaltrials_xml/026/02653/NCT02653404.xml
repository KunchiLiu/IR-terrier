	<detailed_description>The diagnosis tuberculosis child complex procedure . The commonly used test tuberculin skin test ( TST ) , show significant limitation cross-reactivity bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) use vaccination , environmental mycobacteria , possible influence age immunological status patient , need return hospital re-reading intradermal reaction . Since 2001 , Food Drug Administration approve first series new test , call Interferon-Gamma Release Assays ( IGRAs ) , base release interferon gamma sensitize lymphocytes blood patient . Among , QuantiFERON-TBGold In Tube ( QTF-GIT , Cellestis Limited , Carnegie , Victoria , Australia ) , highly specific test measure , ELISA assay , release interferon-gamma production lymphocytes response antigenic challenge Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen . The antigen use test QTF-GIT ( ESAT-6 , CFP-10 sequence TB7.7 ) fact absent vaccine strain BCG nontuberculous mycobacteria , give QTF-GIT test great specificity TST . Moreover , vitro test , require return visit read result ( particularly important screen contact ) , instead carry instrument ( therefore objective ) , finally , thanks presence internal positive control , possible evaluate performance test reduce possible technical error . The QTF-GIT test give significant result adult term sensitivity specificity , demonstrate large scientific literature , currently use many hospital , combination TST , diagnosis tuberculosis . Since September 2012 , also Siena University Hospital introduce QTF-GIT assay diagnostic test tuberculosis diagnosis healthcare worker inpatient outpatient test positive TST require detail diagnostic investigation ( eg . Previous BCG vaccination , suspect atypical mycobacteriosis , eruptive event skin change contraindicate perform intradermal reaction ) . Despite important result obtain test QTF-GIT adult , study specificity sensitivity test conduct pediatric age group still limit . Some study show high specificity , sensitivity appear low TST . The data discordant , however , different study , complicate fact real-Gold standard diagnosis latent TB , hence , analysis still need . While adult risk progression latent infection active pulmonary disease 5-10 % , infant ( &lt; 1 year old ) value increase 30-40 % , therefore diagnosis treatment latent infection ever necessary reduce risk develop disease . Thus urgent need identify specific sensitive diagnostic tool would enable good diagnosis TB childhood , particularly age group 5 year , clearly express also European Centre Disease Prevention Control ( ECDC ) guideline `` Use Interferon-gamma release assay support TB diagnosis '' resolution Regional Council Tuscany Region n. 677 8.4.2014 . The aim project analyze potential contribution IGRA test , QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube test ( QTF-GIT , Cellestis Limited , Carnegie , Victoria , Australia ) diagnosis tuberculosis ( TB - active latent ) pediatric subject age 0 17 year recently expose infection ( indicate `` contact '' ) clinical suspicion active TB , compare result obtain TuberculinSkin Test ( TST ) , gold standard . The research project expect enroll 50 pediatric patient ( 0- 17 year ) 4-year study . Children access Ambulatory structure hospitalize University Infectious Diseases Clinic Pediatric Clinic , University Hospital Siena , access Ambulatory hospitalize Pediatric Clinic USL 9 Grosseto enrol . Once obtain informed consent patient ' parent legal guardian , patient enrol . The doctor administer clinical-anamnestic questionnaire ( CRF ) , relative country birth residence , date arrival Italy stay country origin ( case foreign patient ) , travel abroad , risk factor infectious disease , type contact index case , previous vaccination BCG , date outcome TST , clinical symptom sign suggestive active TB , report instrumental investigation . Together collection blood sample routine purpose , additional blood sample take run experimental IGRA test . Also patient medical doctor independently order run QTF-GIT test necessary tool clinical diagnosis TB include study . A retrospective analysis perform patient pertaining participant Clinics , 1 January 2012 31 May 2015 . Such analysis perform patient medical doctor request intradermal Mantoux IGRA test . Main objective : 1 . Estimation concordance QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube TST pediatric patient expose TB 2 . Evaluation sensitivity test QTF-GIT patient active tuberculosis disease 3 . Evaluation specificity test QTF-GIT infect patient Secondary objective : - Evaluation possible use QTF-GIT , together TST , improve diagnosis latent active tuberculosis infection pediatric subject . - Evaluation possible diagnostic use QTF-GIT child , special attention child &lt; 5 year .</detailed_description>
