	<brief_title>Intraoperative Imaging Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal improve intraoperative identification tumor cell positive margin regional metastasis may miss surgeon pulmonary resection . Improved identification tumor cell result superior disease clearance accurate clinical staging . The investigator hypothesize targeted fluorescent image surgery improve identification positive margin metastasis . Since folate receptor alpha ( FR ) express 55 % resectable lung cancer , investigator utilize fluorescent probe target tumor . As real-time image provide information surgeon , personalize direct operation conduct . This work allow preservation normal tissue , decrease morbidity , decrease surgical time , increase surgical confidence , improved cancer detection , decrease unnecessary surgery ultimately improve tumor free survival . This technology transform clinical surgery art depend fully human factor procedure precision fail safe .</detailed_description>
