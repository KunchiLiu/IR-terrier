	<brief_summary>There currently standard treatment patient neuro-epithelial ( brain ) solid tumor another part body adequate suitable autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell available and/or whose disease relapse standard treatment . Allogeneic Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Transplant may consideration treatment patient recurrent chemo-responsive malignant ( high grade ) neuro-epithelial solid tumor suitable autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell availability . The procedure blood stem cell transplant call autologous ( ) progenitor cell transplant cell match donor transfuse call allogeneic progenitor cell transplant . The study conduct evaluate safety effectiveness combination drug follow allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant ( HPCT ) . This treatment regimen experimental although individual drug commonly use treat disease , specific combination use protocol follow transplant experimental .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-Institutional Phase II Feasibility Study Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Patients With Malignant Neuro-Epithelial Other Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-institutional Phase II feasibility clinical trial hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) ( ) patient recurrent chemo-responsive malignant ( high-grade ) neuro-epithelial solid tumor recurrent follow HSCT ( ii ) say patient without autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell availability . The stem cell derive 1 ) match related donor 2 ) match unrelated donor ( MUD ) . This phase II study novel HSCT protocol patient high-grade and/or recurrent neuro-epithelial solid tumor . To determine feasibility allogeneic HSCT follow thiotepa-based marrow ablative chemotherapy ( MAC ) child high-grade and/or recurrent neuro-epithelial solid tumor . The primary end-point study determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) six month post-HSCT . Secondary end-points include : ( ) overall survival ( OS ) one year ( b ) transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) Day +100 ( c ) engraftment ( ) regimen relate toxicity : frequency severity acute chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , sinusoidal obstructive syndrome infection assess ( e ) time immune reconstitution follow HSCT . Exploratory Aims include : 1 ) To assess feasibility Taqman® Low Density Arrays ( TLDA ) assay technology MRD detection among subset patient high-grade and/or recurrent neuro-epithelial solid tumor . Minimal residual disease ( MRD ) ( applicable ) bone marrow pre- post-HSCT , assess use TLDA . Currently , solid malignancy routinely establish method detect minimal residual disease , first indicator therapy failure and/or recurrence disease . 2 ) In effort minimize morbidity relate graft-versus-host disease , alemtuzumab form important component propose MAC regimen recipient unrelated related mismatch allogeneic graft . As exploratory aim , alemtuzumab assay perform specified interval explore time drug clearance . This may provide important information regard lymphodepletion future trial regard immunotherapy administer recovery HSCT therapy . The main advantage propose approach : 1 ) Overcome challenge bone morrow/peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) collection patient heavily pre-treated and/or bone/bone marrow infiltration tumor . 2 ) Eliminate risk graft contamination tumor cell , 3 ) Graft-versus-tumor effect ( GVT ) eliminate residual disease conditioning chemotherapy . The use allografting propose regimen combine benefit high dose chemotherapy immune approach disease therapy .</detailed_description>
