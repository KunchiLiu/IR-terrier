	<brief_summary>Pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) well-known widely use dynamic preload indicator base heart-lung interaction predict fluid responsiveness . Generally , patient consider fluid-responsive PPV value large 11-13 % . However , several previous research demonstrate zone uncertainty ( grey zone ) PPV . To predict fluid-responsiveness accurately patient PPV within grey zone ( 9-13 % ) , investigator would evaluate augment PPV use augmented ventilation .</brief_summary>
