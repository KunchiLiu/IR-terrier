	<brief_title>The IFR Colon Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult volunteer recruit donate stool sample laboratory-based experiment . Once sample arrive IFR 50-100g add colon model , depend system use , either culture 24h 40 day . During time , factor investigation add model . Samples add mimic food chyme arrive ileal-caecal valve intestinal tract . At stage digest , non-absorbed food component plus cell mucous shed line small intestine enter large intestine . Samples bacteria medium take point incubation . Two model use 1. simple batch culture bacteria , medium test compound added single compartment analyse 24h 2. three compartment model continuous flow medium , test compound bacteria entrance port first chamber exit third chamber mimic movement three main compartment colon . This model allow stable bacterial population establish addition test compound , remain viable 40 day . In case long incubation , multiple time point allow quite complex experiment look interaction bacteria , food pharmaceutical product different factor add different time point . Samples collect incubation analyse centrifuge sample create pellet contain bacteria supernatant contain wide range metabolite . The bacteria analyse extract DNA genomic analysis use RNA base approach . On occasion , conventional microbiological technique might use . The supernatant filter sterilise prior analysis chemical composition technique mass spectrometry , gel electrophoresis , chromatography . Alternatively supernatant may add cell line model interaction bacterial ecosystem cell line colon .</detailed_description>
