	<brief_title>The Clinical Physics Research Image Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy Esophagus Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate benefit adaptive radiation therapy ( ART ) esophageal cancer . 80 patient locally advanced esophageal cancer treat 3D-CRT ( three dimensional conformal radiotherapy , 3D-CRT ) /IMRT ( intensity modulate radiotherapy , IMRT ) , divide experimental group control group ( 40 patient ) . All patient kVCT ( kilo-voltage compute tomography , kVCT ) scan weekly ( fifth fraction week ) CBCT ( cone beam compute tomography , CBCT ) scan per fraction treatment . Irradiated dose distribution patient calculate use CBCT image correct validated modelling accumulate volumetric dose PTV ( plan target volume , PTV ) OARs ( organ risk , OAR ) use deformable registration algorithm . For experimental group , replan treatment target volume cover prescribed dose OARs overdose beyond action level achieve optimal dose distribution . Conversely , action take control group original plan use full treatment course . Dosimetric parameter ( ratio target coverage , mean dose OARs , etc ) , treatment toxicity ( radiation pneumonitis esophagitis ) , PFS（Progress Free Survival , PFS）and OS（Overall Survival , OS）of two group analyze compare study .</detailed_description>
