	<brief_summary>Portal hypertension ( PH ) result increase portal flow resistance fibrotic tissue liver patient chronic liver disease , lead complication varix formation variceal bleeding , ascites formation , spleenomegaly hypersplenismus , systemic haemodynamic disorder porto-systemic shunt formation . Early detection PH patient chronic liver diseases clinically important change patient management order prevent formation/onset recurrence PH complication . Hepatic venous pressure gradient ( HVPG ) measurement gold standard assessment severity PH . However , invasive method risk , relatively costly . On hand transient elastography ( TE ) emerge non-invasive , easy , safe low cost method potential ass severity PH , liver stiffness ( LS ) spleen stiffens ( SS ) measure TE show good correlation HVPG . Real-time 2D shear wave elastography ( RT-2D-SWE ) ultrasound elastography method reliable non-invasive assessment fibrosis stage especially chronic viral hepatitis , preliminary data exist correlation RT-2D-SWE measure LS/SS HVPG . In study hypothesize LS SS measure RT-2D-SWE correlate HVPG enable RT-2D-SWE use assessment severity PH . The primary aim study analyse correlation LS SS assess RT-2D-SWE TE grade portal hypertension assess HVPG . The secondary aim : 1 ) analyse clinical outcome patient order determine LS and/or SS assess RT-2D-SWE might predict adverse outcome ( liver decompensation , death HCC development ) , 2 ) compare clinical performance ( AUC ) RT-2D-SWE TE assessment PH severity well predict clinical outcome . Patients suspicion compensate advanced chronic liver disease ( cACLD ) assesed non-invasive method ( transabdominal ultrasound , laboratory finding , FIB-4 APRI score , LS measurement TE ) , include . Since positive predictive value non-invasive method cirrhosis generally reliable , patient offer transjugular liver biopsy HVPG measurements gold-standard method define stage liver disease severity PH . These patient undergo LS SS measurements RT-2D-SWE Aixplorer SuperSonic Imagine ultrasound system HVPG measurement well , transjugular liver biopsy perform session . After SWE™ HVPG measurement , 5-year follow-up plan , include standard surveillance : laboratory finding , transabdominal US every six month upper-GI endoscopy accord relevant guideline , well treatment accord relevant guideline indicate : beta blocker , endoscopic variceal ligation , etiologic treatment dietary measure . Appropriate statistical analysis undertaken enrollment period , well follow-up period .</brief_summary>
