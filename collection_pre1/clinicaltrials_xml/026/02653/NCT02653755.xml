	<brief_title>The PRECISION Trial ( Profiling Early Breast Cancer Radiotherapy Omission ) : A Phase II Study Breast-Conserving Surgery Without Adjuvant Radiotherapy Favorable-Risk Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational treatment learn whether appropriate treat specific disease . The purpose study determine whether certain patient age 50 75 safely omit radiation treatment lumpectomy.In research study , investigator use standard laboratory test along Prosigna test see certain patient avoid radiation , without high risk cancer come back future . A portion participant surgical specimen prospectively maintain future study use institutionally-approved tissue banking procedure . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) clear Prosigna test generate risk category numerical score ass risk distant recurrence , clear u investigate use Prosigna test help decision radiation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm invasive breast cancer The primary tumor must excise via breast conserving surgery ( `` lumpectomy '' ) negative margin ( `` ink tumor '' ) reexcision show residual disease reexcision specimen . The tumor must unifocal ≤2 cm ( T1 ) large dimension . Immunohistochemical study must demonstrate tumor ER+ ( ≥10 % ) , PR+ , HER2 grade 1 2 . The patient must undergo either sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) demonstrate pathologic nodenegativity ( pN0 ) . However , patient immunohistochemical evidence isolate tumor cell lymph node [ pN0 ( i+ ) ] eligible deposit &gt; 0.2mm identify . Age : study open patient 50 75 year age ( inclusive ) . Patients young 50 year age exclude base prior data suggest different natural history breast cancer arise premenopausal woman ( different subtype biologic distribution may confound current aim ) . Women old 75 year age exclude protocol due historical difficulty achieve robust followup population , along compete comorbidities show interfere subsequent breast cancer monitoring evaluation . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) Life expectancy &gt; 5 year per clinical impression treat physician ( ) . Eligible willing undergo course adjuvant endocrine therapy . Participants must normal endorgan bone marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . At time enrollment , subject may prior systemic therapy breast cancer , include chemotherapy , hormonal therapy target biologic therapy . Similarly , chemotherapy biologic therapy must part subsequent treatment plan . Clinical , radiographic pathologic evidence multifocal multicentric disease . Evidence T4 disease ( e.g. , involvement chest wall , skin , dermal lymphatics , inflammatory breast cancer ) . Grade 3 histology . Tumors invasive component present microinvasion . Multiple breast lesion unless one proven histologically benign . Bilateral breast malignancy . Inability unwillingness tolerate endocrine therapy . Documented mutation TP53 , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , hereditary cancer syndrome . Significant comorbidity associate estimation &lt; 5 remain life year . Another diagnosis malignancy within 5 year precede enrollment ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer situ cervical lesion , permit ) . Inability understand provide inform consent . Current addictive psychiatric disorder may preclude protocol adherence . Prior breast chest radiotherapy indication . Pregnant lactating .</criteria>
