	<detailed_description>Cognitive Assessment Following enrollment , research staff administer battery five neuropsychological measure assess memory , information processing , executive functioning . These measure take approximately 20-30 minute complete . Hypnotic Relaxation Exercise A research staff member administer person Modified Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale ( SHCS ) ass hypnotizability participant follow enrollment prior randomization . This measure take approximately 15-20 minute complete . Baseline Data Demographic Form A research staff member ask participant provide demographic data ( age , sex , marital status , income , education level , employment status ) deployment history ( number month deployment , whether deployment involve hostile duty ) descriptive purpose . We also ask participant history receive study treatment , presence history military sexual trauma . The baseline data demographic form take approximately 20-30 minute complete , may complete follow enrollment either person telephone late time convenient participant . Brain Wave Activity ( EEG ) Assessment Brain wave activity assess follow enrollment conduct brain wave activity EEG assessment . The brain wave activity assessment take place Integrated Brain Imaging Center ( IBIC ) University Washington main campus . The IBIC research-dedicated technology center organize department Radiology . EEG sample electrode array use electrode net dip saline solution . The research staff member , IBIC employee Without Compensation ( WOC ) appointment VA , collect EEG activity data , ask participant remain still possible portion assessment . The EEG technician collect participant data regard medication use within 24 hour assessment . He/she also ask participant rate intensity pain assessment ( current pain ) , minute assessment ( current pain bad , least , average pain past minute ) , end EEG session ( current pain , worst , least , average pain past minute ) , use 0-10 Numerical Rating Scales . The entire brain wave activity assessment take approximately 45-60 minute complete . Subjects ask complete brain activity assessment follow completion treatment follow procedure . Participants may still participate study decline participate EEG assessment . Assessment : Pre-Treatment General Overview Subjective report pain intensity vary time , accurately measure pain intensity ( primary outcome ) , valid ass multiple time take average . Hence , develop method assessment seek obtain four telephone assessment period one week 7 day minimum 24 hour assessment . During telephone contact , research staff ask participant , minimum , rate current , average , bad least pain intensity past 24 hour , well average pain intensity past 7 day . In addition , possible , research staff ask participant rate current , average , bad least pain intensity past week final telephone contact . These assessment refer `` short assessment . '' The primary outcome average 24-hour rating ( range=1-4 rating ) average pain intensity obtain period one week assessment period . In addition , sometime assessment period researcher ask question regard pain interference , depression , anxiety , sleep disturbance , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptom , medication use , medical service utilization , thought pain treatment motivation . This latter set question ask assessment period , refer `` long assessment . '' Research staff give participant option : 1 ) complete long assessment one four short telephone assessment describe ; 2 ) spread long assessment across several day assessment period . The entire long assessment portion thereof may fall two day outside 7-day period four short assessment . The entire time require answer question assessment period 45-60 minute . The assessment period describe complete prior initiating treatment , completion treatment session # 2 , 4 6 8 ( i.e . post-treatment ) , 3 6 month follow end treatment total seven time . These assessment period occur follow start treatment also include question group climate , therapeutic alliance group clinician , treatment satisfaction , overall improvement since participant begin pain program . Randomization Enrolled participant complete require baseline component ( cognitive assessment , hypnotic relaxation exercise , baseline data form , pre-treatment assessment period ) randomize stratified block ensure participant sex pain type ( neuropathic , non-neuropathic , mixed undetermined ) equal chance randomize one 3 condition . Treatment Scheduling Cohorts study intervention group offer begin every four month . In 4-month period , two class option condition , one base Seattle one American Lake . Thus , six class offer per four month period , total 18 class per year . Up 15 participant enrol intervention class ; 10 spot protect research participant , remain 5 Veterans complete study wish try another type intervention , non-research participant . If protect research spot fill start cohort , non-research participant offer spot vice versa . Treatment In three treatment condition , intervention appointment schedule regular group clinic VA facility ( American Lake Seattle ) . This mean treatment session appear Veterans ' list regular clinical appointment . Although appointment schedule 90 minute , practice last 60-80 minute , 10 minute time cushion build allow participant may mobility limitation arrive , settle , vacate group room without hurry . The group session conduct VAPSHCS provider undergo formal two-day training process prepares clinician conduct three treatment intervention group set . In condition , home practice activity assign increase engagement treatment . Participants ask record extent engagement activity use form provide clinician . We realize adherence intervention assign outside treatment session may influence study outcome utilize data collect clinician homework compliance . In addition , participant intervention give treatment workbook material refer discuss group session well additional material read session . Please see description study treatment intervention . Data Collected Treatment Sessions Participants complete hand form regard completion task `` homework '' assign clinician previous session . In addition , participant complete hand form session include question regard pain intensity comfort level , well question participant find helpful non-helpful treatment . Finally , study clinician complete form session capture information regard perceive engagement participant particular session . All form label subject 's name . Audio Recordings The group treatment session audio record make sure study clinician follow study procedure . Optional Assessments For pre-treatment post-treatment telephone assessment period , research staff use script invite participant upon complete assessment period participate optional assessment consist two measure develop study researcher . The optional assessment take approximately 10-15 minute complete , consist question participant feel feel pain think pain problem , participant respond pain . Open Label Phase Following completion 6-month telephone assessment period research staff invite participant complete one treatment group attend participation main phase . Participants would participate one treatment group time . The open label phase include screen procedure ; research participants welcome participate . Research staff schedule consent session participant interested participate 'open label phase ' study .</detailed_description>
