	<detailed_description>Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) lead cause pain disability among Veterans , Department Veterans Affairs health care user severely affect . There ample evidence exercise improve pain , function , outcomes among patient knee OA . However , vast majority individual knee OA physically inactive . There clearly need develop implement program efficiently effectively foster regular physical activity improve key patient-centered outcome among Veterans knee OA . This objective study evaluate effectiveness novel STepped Exercise Program Knee OsteoArthritis ( STEP-KOA ) . This randomize controlled trial n=345 Veterans symptomatic knee OA two VA Integrated Networks ( VISN ) 6 site , participant assign two study arm : STEP-KOA Arthritis Education Control ( AE ) . STEP-KOA begin three month access low-resource internet-based exercise training program use patient-specific information determine deliver appropriate personalize exercise plan ( Step 1 ) . Participants meet response criterion clinically meaningful improvement pain function three month Step 1 additionally receive telephone call exercise counselor three month , facilitate adherence address barrier physical activity ( Step 2 ) . Participants still fail meet response criterion Step 2 receive in-person physical therapy visit , address specific functional impairment tailor exercise recommendation ( Step 3 ) . Outcomes assessed baseline , 3-months , 6-months , 9 month ( primary outcome time point ) . Veterans AE group offer participation STEP-KOA completing study assessment . The primary outcome Western Ontario McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) , measure low extremity pain , stiffness function . The secondary outcome objective measure physical function . The main study analysis compare STEP-KOA intervention AE control condition follow-up time point . The investigator also evaluate patient characteristic associate need progression Step conduct cost-effectiveness analysis STEP-KOA . This step exercise intervention match patient need , also provide VA potential approach focus limited physical therapy resource toward patient respond adequately initial , less resource intensive costly strategy improve physical activity relate outcome .</detailed_description>
