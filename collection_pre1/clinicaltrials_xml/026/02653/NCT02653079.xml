	<brief_summary>Patients suffer chronic degenerating disease often treat plethora NSAIDs , DMARDs , Biologicals , well combination therapeutic . However , many patient refractory treatment suffer chronic pain year , lead worsen quality live . The mobilization patient one main goal therapy chronic inflammatory disease . Low dose radiation therapy ( LDRT ) apply since one century local treatment chronic degenerate joint disease . The success treatment describe many retrospective well pattern care study , respectively . Local ( painful joint ) low dose irradiation chronic patient result patient significantly reduce pain , direct therapy , also last 12 month many case . The patient experience enhanced mobility increase quality life . The molecular cellular process lead pain reduction fragmentarily analyze . Our group reveal macrophage key player radiation-induced immune modulation . Inflammatory macrophage expose low dos radiation show reduced inflammatory capacity attenuate inflammatory microenvironment . Besides macrophage immune cell likely involved reduction inflammation follow LD-RT , vitro already show neutrophil . The IMMO-LDRT01 study aim first time analyze detail immune status patient suffer inflammatory , chronic joint disease , LD-RT longitudinal manner . The multi-color flow cytometry-based assay allow determine 30 immune cell subset additionally activation status . Further , biodosimetry perform whole-blood sample get hint dose immune cell expose . This perform national international co-operation partner . The IMMO-LDRT01 study prospective observational study influence standard therapeutic scheme provide hint LDRT affect besides local cell irradiate area also systemic inflammatory response .</brief_summary>
