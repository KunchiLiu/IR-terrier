	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine perineural dexmedetomidine provide increase prolongation analgesia compare perineural dexamethasone patient receive regional block shoulder surgery . If , dexmedetomidine may serve superior adjunct peripheral nerve block rapidly evolve , ambulatory-centered surgical setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analgesic Duration Dexmedetomidine Compared Dexamethasone Adjuncts Single Shot Interscalene Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , commonly employ adjunct peripheral nerve blockade perineural dexamethasone . In general , dos use regional anesthesia , dexamethasone minimal side effect profile . However , show increase duration analgesia , concern regard neurotoxicity animal study . In addition , dexamethasone potential cause hyperglycemia patient impair glucose metabolism well perineal pain pruritis administer peripherally . Dexmedetomidine highly selective alpha-2 agonist commonly use patient undergo anesthesia require sedation non-operative setting . As peripherally administer medication , sedate analgesic property , well added benefit avoidance respiratory depression . Although rarely produce cardiac depression high dos , side effect profile otherwise minimal generally well tolerated patient . When administer peripherally , dexmedetomidine commonly associate side effect hypotension , respiratory depression , bradycardia - although significantly high dos plan study . The safe use perineural dexmedetomidine together local anesthetic describe numerous occasion . Nevertheless , although show potentiate peripheral nerve blockade prolong duration analgesia various study , remain rarely use adjunct regional anesthesia .</detailed_description>
