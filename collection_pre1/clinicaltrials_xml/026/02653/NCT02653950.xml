	<brief_title>Traditional Septoplasty Vs Endoscopic Septoplasty Treating Deviated Nasal Septum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasal obstruction one common complaint otorhinolaryngologist face daily practice . Deviated nasal septum ( DNS ) frequently encounter common cause . It cause breathe difficulty also result improper aeration paranasal sinuses predisiposing sinusitis also result dry mucosa lead crust epistaxis 1,2 . DNS also accompany hypertrophic nasal turbinate cause sleep disturbance snoring3 . Septoplasty accept common surgical intervention improve nasal airway4 sleep disturbances3 . Traditional septoplasty procedure involve sum mucosal resection anterior septum . The result long-term symptom relief traditional septoplasty contradictory review publication 5 . In last two decade endoscopic Sino nasal surgery widely use include endoscopic approach septoplasty . Endoscopic septoplasty minimally invasive technique dissection nasal septal flap limit minimize trauma . The excellent visualization presume decrease morbidity post-operative swelling isolated septal deviation limit excision area deviation 2 . Furthermore , diagnose treat abnormality lateral wall nose sit feasible endoscopic approach . At time study , study compare change quality life patient undergoing traditional septoplasty Vs endoscopic septoplasty . The investigator aim ass whether endoscopic septoplasty effective improving patient QOL reduce postoperative sign complication . Aims Primary : 1 ) To assess difference overall QOL endoscopic traditional septoplasty adjust pertinent confounding variable . Secondary : 1 . To evaluate post-operative complication rate patient undergo endoscopic septoplasty compare traditional . 2 . To evaluate difference operation time two different approach .</detailed_description>
