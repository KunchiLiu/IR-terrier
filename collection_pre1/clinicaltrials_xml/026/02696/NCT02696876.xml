	<brief_summary>This proof-of-concept study determine safety efficacy novel device increase reparative capacity knee . The discovery resident population mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) within synovial fluid ( SF ) first description reparative cell population direct access superficial cartilage joint structure . The ready access SF MSC cartilage joint tissue offer novel strategy joint repair . Current arthroscopic procedure result removal SF MSCs due continuous irrigation throughout procedure . The current study would benefit patient greatly increase reparative capacity joint bolster MSC number retain MSCs within joint surgery . By access MSCs synovium anticipate cell would entrapped/migrate marrow clot form microfracture sub-chondral bone . These MSCs would supplement marrow may result fast , good quality repair .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Synovium Brushing Augmented Microfracture Improved Cartilage Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The synovium rich source potent chondrogenic mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSCs ) . Gaining access valuable source regenerative cell could improve outcome joint restorative procedure . To avoid costly two-stage procedure ex vivo manipulation , exploit autologous cell minimally invasive way minimal manipulation could provide novel cost-effective approach . This study evaluate safety , feasibility efficacy novel medical device ( synovial brush ) procedure ( synovial brushing ) increase number autologous minimally manipulate MSCs knee . Twenty patient undergoing microfracture isolate chondral defect randomly assign either control group ( microfracture , 10 patient ) intervention group ( microfracture plus synovial brushing , 10 patient ) . The device intend increase number MSCs within joint final stage surgery , aid repair bolster MSCs recruit bone marrow .</detailed_description>
