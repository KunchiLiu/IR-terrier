	<brief_summary>Feasibility methylene blue-based combination therapy radical treatment adult patient Plasmodium vivax malaria Ethiopia : randomise controlled pilot trial Study rationale : Elimination become goal malaria program increase number endemic country region . Primaquine ( PQ ) register drug radical cure Plasmodium vivax malaria . Prolonged PQ-based combination therapy carry safety concern resistance chloroquine ( CQ ) PQ emerge . Methylene blue ( MB ) recently show safe effective treatment Plasmodium falciparum malaria West Africa . As evidence MB probably effective hypnozoites Plasmodium vivax , MB-based drug regimen could alternative PQ-based combination therapy Plasmodium vivax malaria . Study objectives : The main objective trial study feasibility MB-based combination therapy patient uncomplicated P. vivax malaria endemic area Ethiopia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim ( 1 ) test feasibility cost method procedure later use MB-based combination therapy large scale , ( 2 ) ass safety MB-based combination therapy , ( 3 ) estimate efficacy MB-based combination therapy malaria relapse , ( 4 ) study community acceptance MB-based combination therapy , ( 5 ) strengthen local capacity malaria research control Jimma/Ethiopia . Study design : The study design pilot trial adult patient uncomplicated P. vivax malaria Jimma , Ethiopia . Patients randomise three treatment group : 1 . Arthemeter/Lumefantrine ( AL ) 2 . AL-PQ , 3 . AL-MB . Follow-up period 6 month . Study population : Adult patient uncomplicated P. vivax malaria ( age ≥18 year ) Jimma/Ethiopia ( G6PD deficient subject exclude ) become enrolled outpatient department study centre . The sample size 33 per study arm , total 99 patient . Study treatment : - AL standard treatment twice daily ( total 80 mg/dose A plus 480 mg/dose L ) first three study day - PQ 15 mg daily 14 day - MB 780 mg daily 14 day Treatments 100 % directly observe . Study outcomes : Outcome parameter feasibility cost ( e.g . recruitment rate , retention rate , cost per patient ) , safety parameter ( e.g . haemoglobin development follow-up , incidence adverse event ) , efficacy parameter ( e.g . incidence P. vivax relapse follow-up , malaria recurrence-free efficacy day 180 ) , community acceptance ( e.g . perception blue urine ) follow-up .</detailed_description>
