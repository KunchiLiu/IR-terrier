	<brief_summary>This study investigational cancer vaccine call GRN-1201 . Treatment GRN-1201 vaccine type immunotherapy . The goal immunotherapy stimulate body 's immune system ( white blood cell ) attack cancer cell kill . GRN-1201 consist 4 different peptide ( small part protein ) express melanoma cell . The intent treatment GRN-1201 increase body 's immune response melanoma . To increase body 's immune response tumor cell , GRN-1201 vaccine mixed Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF , also know sargramostim ) . GM-CSF man-made protein help stimulate immune system increase response tumor cell . This phase I study mean first time GRN-1201 give combination GM-CSF human . It test small number people evaluate safety , find safe dose , identify side effect . The safety GRN-1201 test three different dos ; GM-CSF dose remain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study GRN-1201 HLA-A*02 Subjects With Resected Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GRN-1201 novel HLA-A*02-restricted multiple-peptide , therapeutic cancer vaccine , develop GreenPeptide treatment melanoma induce immune response tumor associate antigen ( TAAs ) , particularly cytotoxic T cell ( CTL ) responses . Granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating-factor ( GM-CSF ) ( Leukine® , SanofiAventis ) administer combination GRN-1201 immuno-adjuvant In contrast advanced melanoma , treatment option adjuvant set limit . Surgical resection primary treatment Stage IIb , IIc , III melanoma patient . The rate disease recurrence patient American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) TNM Stage II ( T2-4N0M0 ) Stage III ( TanyN+M0 ) disease range 20 -60 % , 5-year overall survival 45 - 70 % . Thus , safe effective treatment option reduce risk recurrence much need . Considering generally safe nature , peptide-based cancer vaccine would ideal address unmet medical need . Patients Stage IIb , IIc III melanoma , general , healthy follow local therapy . They anticipate maintain immune system uncompromised chemotherapy disease burden . Further , may already develop immune response TAAs target GRN-1201 , may increase probability develop effective immune response . It conceivable combination peptide vaccine immune checkpoint inhibitor , especially PD-1 pathway inhibitor , could enhance efficacy immunotherapy without increase toxicity . Studies evaluate combination melanoma vaccine nivolumab advance melanoma [ 14 ] resect high-risk metastatic melanoma patient [ 15 ] report encouraging clinical outcome . The pre-clinical data suggest GRN-1201 may anti-tumor activity adjuvant set may enhance activity drug checkpoint inhibitor adjuvant metastatic disease setting , enhance immune response TAAs .</detailed_description>
