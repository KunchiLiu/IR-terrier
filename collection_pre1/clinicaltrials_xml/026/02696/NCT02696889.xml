	<brief_title>Rejuvenation Premature Ovarian Failure With Stem Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature ovarian failure ( POF ) define hypergonadotropic ovarian failure occur prior age 40 . It surprisingly common affect approximately 1 % woman age 40 . The incidence 10 % 28 % woman primary amenorrhea 4 % 18 % woman secondary amenorrhea . The clinical manifestation include amenorrhea abnormally high level luteinizing ( LH ) follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) . The etiology POF unknown case . It cause combination inherited condition , immune disorder , environmental toxin iatrogenic injury . The majority patient POF consider idiopathic premature ovarian failure usually cause identify . POF show associate increased incidence condition , include Alzheimer 's , cardiovascular immune system diseases , metabolic syndrome , osteoporosis , diabetes cancer reproductive organ . POF characterize loss secondary follicle , arrest folliculogenesis , decrease estrogen production , infertility . The mechanism ovarian failure likely accelerate follicular atresia detail pathogenesis yet fully understood . In woman young 40 , least two menopausal FSH level ( ≥40 IU/L ) sufficient diagnosis POF . It essential amenorrhea diagnosis POF , spontaneous menstrual cycle sometimes see diagnosis well . Resumption normal ovarian function , albeit temporary , patient normal karyotype document 10 20 % patient ; thus , resumption fertility possible . No presently available therapeutic intervention proven effective restore normal fertility patient POF . Various attempt ovarian stimulation usually unsuccessful . Therefore , diagnosis POF cause great physical mental suffering among patient . Thus , critical need develop novel effective approach treatment POF . Throughout life , ongoing physiological level atresia oocytes . A decreased germ cell endowment combine increased rate germ cell destruction explain POF . The current concept ovary static ovarian reserve entirely odds germ cell dynamic . Current research support concept ovary continue produce new germ cell adult life , however occur human universally accept yet . Recent research suggest diminish ovarian reserve result age niche rather defect germ cell . Emerging evidence suggest bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( BMSCs ) could restore structure function injured tissue . During embryologic development , cell mesodermal layer give rise multiple mesenchymal tissue type include bone , cartilage , tendon , muscle , fat marrow stroma . These precursor cell , also present postnatal organism , refer mesenchymal stem cell . These stem cell show retain developmental potential follow extensive subcultivation vitro . Implantation culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cell demonstrate effect tissue regeneration variety animal model depend local factor stimulate differentiation appropriate phenotype . Recent study suggest stem cell therapy hold promise treatment variety diseases include reproductive dysfunction . In recent investigation lab , bone marrow stem cell ( BMSC ) treat animal reveal recovered ovarian function . Post bone marrow nucleate cell transplantation , treat animal reveal resumption estrogen production folliculogenesis . In another investigation Lui et al ( 2014 ) , granulosa cell apoptosis induce cisplatin reduce BMSCs migrate granulosa cell vitro . In study , chemotherapy-induced POF rat inject BMSCs . The BMSCs treatment group 's antral follicle count estradiol level increase 30 day , compare untreated POF group . In recent clinical trial Egypt , Edessy et al evaluate therapeutic potential autologous mesenchymal bone marrow stem cell transplantation woman POF . Ten patient POF select ovary inject autologous BMSC via laparoscopy . The result reveal resumption menstruation one case 3 month ; two case show focal secretory change atrophic endometrium . According result , BMSC seem ability revive prematurely failed ovary hormonal follicular development ability .</detailed_description>
