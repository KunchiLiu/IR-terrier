	<brief_title>A Study IBRF Disorders Consciousness Advanced Care/MultiModal Care Protocol Severe Disorders Consciousness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , empirically validate , evidence-based pharmacological intervention treatment Severe Disorders Consciousness ( SDOC ) . In addition , unclear poly-pharmacological intervention , common treatment disorder ( e.g. , cancer , chronic pain ) , embrace treatment SDOC ; lone agent use treatment SDOC patient `` indicated '' combine treatment . In addition , treatment SDOC traditionally employ use single small combination pharmacological agent , single pharmacological agent identify efficacious effective . As , poly-pharmacological intervention may , inherently , involve pharmacological interaction anticipate drug manufacturer prescribe physician . The purpose study document safety IBRF ACP/MCP establish efficacy SDOC patient successfully complete treatment . The IBRF ACP/MCP employ poly-pharmacological approach aim study arousal state outcome SDOC patient beyond rate documented literature .</detailed_description>
