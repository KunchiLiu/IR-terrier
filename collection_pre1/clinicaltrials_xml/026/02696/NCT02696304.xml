	<brief_summary>Along improvement childhood acute leukemia treatment , survival rate increase . Therefore , number long term childhood leukemia survivor increase progressively last decade . So , assessment long term health status population become important . Many study show increase risk life threaten late complication early mortality . Cardiovascular morbidity mortality particularly frequent . Among late complication , metabolic syndrome ( MS ) important concern since associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality . The overall MS prevalence French prospective cohort survivor childhood acute leukemia 9.2 % 18.6 % case total body irradiation ( TBI ) leukemia treatment . Since median age MS evaluation 21 year , prevalence high . Anyway , MS pathophysiology population still poorly understood . One recent hypothesis MS mechanism base adipose tissue inability store fatty acid : adipose tissue expanse store excess nutriment lipids accumulate tissue . This ectopic lipid accumulation cause insulin resistance MS . The investigator hypothesize adipose tissue could damage treatment receive childhood acute leukemia treatment ( particularly TBI ) . This lead morphological functional abnormality could promote insulin resistance MS . This ectopic adipose tissue contain less preadipocytes , could impair functional property . The primary endpoint study compare morphological functional characteristic adipose tissue patient MS receive TBI childhood leukemia treatment . This comparison focus : - The adipose tissue repartition evaluation ectopic adipose tissue - Fibrosis inflammation adipose tissue - Preadipocytes quantification The secondary endpoint describe : - whole cohort include patient , - clinical biological characteristic associate MS. - Cardiovascular risk factor nutritional statement - Anthropometric measurement - Detection endocrinal abnormality possibly associate MS - Analysis inflammation blood marker adipokines quantification .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enroled patient ( group ) evaluate follow criterion . Then , comparison group perform . 1 . Primary endpoint : following factor study , compare group ( without TBI ) : - Adipose tissue repartition use biphotonic absorptiometry abdominal MRI - Ectopic adipose tissue evaluation ( visceral hepatical ) use MRI proton spectroscopy - Adipose tissue inflammation ( use PCR array ) : quantification follow biomarkers : alpha TNF , IL6 , IL1beta , IL10 , MCP1 , leptine adiponectine - Adipose tissue fibrosis ( PCR array ) : quantification follow marker fibrosis : Col 1a1 , Col 3a1 , Col 6a1 , Col 6a3 , Tenascin C , Lumican , TGF beta - Preadipocytes quantification adipose tissue ( immunohistochemistery ) Concerning secondary endpoint , follow point study : - Cardiovascular risk factor nutritional statement - Anthropometric measurement - Other endocrinal abnormality possibly associate MS - Analysis inflammation blood marker adipokines quantification .</detailed_description>
