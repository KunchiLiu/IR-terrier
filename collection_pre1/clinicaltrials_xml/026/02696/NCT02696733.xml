	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided ONB Transurethral Procedures - Interadductor Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The basic method diagnosis management bladder cancer endoscopic procedure . Transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) usually perform spinal anesthesia prevent unintended stimulation obturator nerve ( ON ) electroresection perform lateral wall bladder . This sensorimotor nerve arise lumbar plexus L2-L4 . It innervate muscle responsible adduct thigh skin surface paramedian segment thigh . During TURBT , bladder fill irrigation fluid , ON directly adjacent lateral wall bladder stimulate electroresection . Sudden contraction adductor muscle thigh , may lead perforation bladder wall resectoscope loop . In Department General , Oncologic Functional Urology , Medical University Warsaw approximately 500 TURBT perform every year ; 7 % necessitate prevention ON stimulation . Anesthetists perform obturator nerve block ( ONB ) - anterior branch , use stimulator identification 94 % efficacy . Recently , ultrasound guidance use enhance safety efficacy nerve block decide evaluate effectiveness ONB perform ultrasound . An approval Medical University Warsaw Bioethical Committee obtain . Patients need give write informed consent participate study . It anticipate 100 patient TURBT perform spinal anesthesia , urologist decision , necessitate ONB enrol study . Before procedure oral premedication give . After admission operating room , intravenous access establish patient receives drip infusion 500 ml 0.9 % Natrium Chloratum antibiotic ( 2nd generation cephalosporin ) . Constant monitoring ensure ECG , heart rate , pulse oxymetry . Non-invasive blood pressure measurement take every five minute . To maintain patient ' blood oxygenation , oxygen deliver use facemask . Spinal anesthesia perform patient sit position , frequently L3 L4 space ( case technical difficulty - L2 L3 L4 L5 ) use 8-15 mg 0.5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine depend patient 's anthropometric parameter . The needle use 25-27G pencil point . After drug administration , patient place supine position . Upon reach appropriate anesthesia level ( Th10 ) , block conduction sensory nerve fiber bladder , patient place lithotomy position . In case tumor locate lateral wall bladder , safety TURBT ensure use neurotest perform urologist nerve stimulator build resectoscope ( Neurotester FB2 , ERBE ) . The extremity movement lead decision block ON . Ultrasound-guided ONB procedure : The patient remain lithotomy position . For nerve identification linear transducer use . It place next grain visualize three adductor muscle . Between adductor longus adductor brevis , fascial plane , anterior branch obturator visualize . The needle advanced toward nerve out-of-plane trajectory . The local anesthetic inject heme-negative aspiration . The resistance injection avoid reduce risk intraneural injection . If problem nerve identification anesthetic inject fascial plane adductor muscle - longus brevis . 10 ml 2 % lidocaine use single block 2 x 10 ml 2 % lidocaine epinephrine bilateral one need . Before TURBT start , urologist perform neurotest evaluate ONB efficacy . After enrol 50 patient study result evaluate decision whether decrease amount 10 ml 2 % lidocaine injection take .</detailed_description>
