	<brief_summary>There 2 part research study : Part 1 ( dose escalation ) Part 2 ( dose expansion ) . The goal Part 1 clinical research study find high tolerable dose nivolumab give either radiation therapy alone combination radiation ipilimumab , patient NSCLC . The goal Part 2 study learn dose nivolumab find Part 1 give radiation therapy ipilimumab help control disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Nivolumab With Radiation Nivolumab Ipilimumab With Radiation Treatment Intracranial Metastases From Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Therapy : If find eligible take part study , assign study part ( learn dose level nivolumab receive ) 1 2 study arm ( learn treatment combination receive ) . This do one know one study part , good , bad . - If enrol Arm A , receive nivolumab vein 1 hour every 2 week radiation therapy . - If enrol Arm B , receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute every 6 week , nivolumab vein 1 hour every 2 week , radiation therapy . The study doctor decide type radiation therapy ( either stereotactic radiosurgery [ SRS ] whole brain radiation therapy [ WBRT ] ) receive . If receive SRS therapy , receive 1 time . If receive WBRT therapy , receive 1 time day 10 day . If enrol Part 1 study , dose nivolumab receive depend join study . The first group participant receive high dose nivolumab . If intolerable side effect see , next group participant receive low dose . If enrol Part 2 study , dose nivolumab receive depend result see Part 1 . The study doctor tell dose nivolumab receive . All participant receive dose ipilimumab radiation therapy . Study Visits : Right first treatment 2 week ( +/- 3 day ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . About 1 month receive radiation : - You MRI , CT , PET/CT scan check status disease . - You complete neurocognitive exam . Length Study : You may continue receive study drug ( ) unless disease get bad , intolerable side effect , unable follow study direction . You receive radiation therapy begin study , either 1 time 10 day . If disease appear get bad tumor appear get large , may still able receive study drug doctor decide best interest . Sometimes disease appear get bad study drug actually work . However , risk continue receive study drug ( ) disease may actually get bad . You still risk side effect due study drug ( ) . This could also delay start treatment . The disease may get bad point longer able receive treatment . The study doctor discus option . Your participation study complete follow-up . Follow-Up : About 30 day last dose study drug ( ) , physical exam . Long-Term Follow-Up : Every 12 week 1 year : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You MRI , CT , PET/CT scan check status disease . - You complete neurocognitive exam . If follow-up do another hospital , information medical history , physical exam , routine blood test , image scan send MD Anderson review . If come MD Anderson follow visit , study team may call every 12 week ask . Each call last 10 minute . This investigational study . Both WBRT SRS radiation FDA approve local control metastatic primary tumor . Nivolumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma NSCLC . Ipilimumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma . It consider investigational use radiation therapy , nivolumab , ipilimumab treat NSCLC . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 80 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
