	<brief_summary>Significant morbidity , mortality , related cost cause traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . An externally-worn medical device applies mild jugular compression accord principle Queckenstedt Maneuver ( Device ) . Preliminary research suggest Device potential reduce likelihood TBI . The currently develop collar approve study human result indicate safety use high demand maximal exertion activity , This study investigate effectiveness device high school athlete play collision sport football . The use helmet high-risk sport allow collision measurement device embed helmet affect play fit equipment . Athletes participate study randomly assign one two group : 1 ) Device wear season 2 ) Non-device wear season . The helmet participant outfit accelerometer measure magnitude every impact head sustain athlete . Effectiveness device determine via difference longitudinal brain image functional test follow competitive football participation . A subset athlete report diagnose concussion also receive additional brain neuroanatomical neurophysiological testing within week follow diagnosed concussive event . The purpose study monitor longitudinal change brain structure function preseason postseason , population football playing athlete wear Device compare similar population wear device . Secondly , purpose determine protection device relative amount magnitude sustain head impact .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Device promise provide novel mechanism reduce prevent likelihood TBI , may use conjunction protective equipment . TBI lead cause death individual age 45 . The cost TBI U.S. estimate anywhere $ 50 $ 150 billion , annually . The January , 2008 New England Journal Medicine report , `` Head neck injury , include severe brain trauma , report one quarter service member evacuate Iraq Afghanistan '' . The vast majority injury result exposure improvise explosive device ( IED ) blast wave . Head injury , concussion result trauma public discussion recently National Football League ( NFL ) deal lawsuit regard head injury one-third live former NFL player . According NASA , `` The oscillation fluid cause external force , call sloshing , occur move vehicle contain liquid mass , truck , etc . '' This oscillation occur vessel partially fill . It hypothesize brain face similar slosh energy absorption external force impartation . Slosh permit external energy absorb content partially fill vessel container mean inelastic collision . Tissues differ density decelerate different rate create shear cavitation . If collision object molecule elastic , transfer energy object diminishes , minimize energy impart slosh . Woodpeckers , head ram sheep mammal ( include human ) small , little know misunderstood muscle neck call omohyoid muscle . Highly G-tolerant creature forest utilized muscle gently restrict outflow internal jugular vein thereby `` take '' excess compliance cranial space ultimately protect TBI like tiny `` airbags '' motor vehicle . Rat study demonstrate easily safely facilitate muscle 's action well-engineered gentle compression muscle . The medical Queckenstedt Maneuver devise detect spinal cord compression , gently place pressure external jugular vein increase cerebral spinal volume pressure . In maneuver , vein compress lumbar puncture monitor intracranial pressure . `` Normally , pressure rise high 'plateau ' level occur instantly upon jugular compression fall equally fast upon release compression '' . This incredibly simple principle employ protect soldier athletes TBI safely , reversibly , increase intracranial volume pressure . The neck collar device make Outer collar - hytrel ( thermoplastic elastomer ) , Inner collar - TPSiV ( thermoplastic elastomer ) , metal insert ( stainless steel ) , fit neck provide comfortable precise jugular compression potentially mitigate cerebral slosh . Although skull , blood , brain `` almost incompressible , '' vasculature tree cerebrum quite reactive compressible . As volume add cranium , eventually compensatory reserve volume surpass intracranial pressure increase slightly . Increasing cerebral blood volume 1-3 % safely reversibly reduce compliance cerebral vascular tree diminishes absorption slosh energy . Jugular compression increase cerebral blood volume almost instantaneously . As mention , degree increase significantly mitigate slosh TBI laboratory animal mimic highly concussion resistant wild animal able reflexively increase cerebral blood volume natural jugular compression . A landmark article , publish Journal Neurosurgery , use standard acceleration-deceleration impact laboratory model mild TBI . The study show successful marked reduction axonal injury follow Internal Jugular Vein ( IJV ) compression indicate immunohistochemical staining Amyloid Precursor Proteins ( APP ) . It argue IJV compression reduces slosh-mediated brain injury increase intracranial blood volume reduce compliance potential brain movement within confines skull . The potential technique mitigate linear rotational brain injury human `` internal protection '' represent novel approach mitigate TBI . The current project design follow prospective longitudinal study design . All MRI scan perform 3 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI scanner locate Imaging Research Center ( IRC ) Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Research Foundation ( CCHRF ) . Sedation use test visit . The entire MRI series , include anatomical imaging , DTI , rest state fMRI , SWI , HARDI , ASL BOLD complete 65 minute less ( see Table 1 detailed specification ) . All functional neurocognitive testing perform Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Human Performance Laboratory .</detailed_description>
