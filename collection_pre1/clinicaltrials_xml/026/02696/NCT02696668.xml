	<detailed_description>Falls old adult major impact health , morbidity mortality significant cost implication healthcare provider ( Alexander et al. , 1992 , Tinetti Williams , 1998 , Davis et al. , 2010 ) . Government legislation state target multifactorial fall rehabilitation programme provide old adult faller ( Excellence , 2013 ) . The FaME programme , group base rehabilitation programme report effective improve balance walk speed , reduce number fall , chance hospitalization , institutionalization , death , fear fall ( Skelton et al. , 2005 , Yeung et al. , 2014 ) . Sensory integration re-weighting peripheral sensory information visual , somatosensory , vestibular ( i.e . inner ear ) system play important role maintain balance ( Horak , 2006 ) . However , recently study incorporate vestibular exercise fall rehabilitation programme therefore , efficacy type multisensory balance programme old adult faller unknown . A recent study show programme combine widely use modify OTAGO fall rehabilitation programme multisensory balance exercise feasible old adult faller may great beneficial effect balance , gait , fall risk compare OTAGO programme isolation ( Liston et al. , 2014 ) . However , multisensory rehabilitation target sensory integration re-weighting crucial postural control address current guideline . To develop best programme fall prevention , understand complexity postural control define specify exercise programme target essential system require . The FaME programme include certain multisensory balance exercise , introduce latter phase programme . This study 's main aim compare effect modify FaME vs. multisensory balance exercise programme fall risk , balance confidence quality life old adult fall risk fall implement group set . Research question : Primary research question : Does exposure multisensory balance rehabilitation provide good outcome balance confidence , fall risk quality life old adult fall risk fall compare modified FaME programme ? Secondary research question : 1 . What long term effect multisensory balance rehabilitation programme vs. modify FaME outcome measure score fall rate ? 2 . Is relationship baseline cognitive function , vestibular function intervention outcome ? 3 . Can vestibular dysfunction effectively screen community set ? Study design : This study single blind randomise control study investigate effect multisensory balance rehabilitation programme vs. modify FaME fall risk , balance confidence quality life old adult fall risk fall . This study two arm provide within community-based setting . This study compare intervention outcome participant receive modify FaME fall rehabilitation programme receive multisensory balance rehabilitation exercise .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Older adult 65 year old old either experience fall risk fall ( Timed Up Go score &gt; 15 second ) refer assess physiotherapist fall rehabilitation group class . 1 . Older adult : ) Cardiac syncope/pre−syncope ii ) Postural hypotension iii ) A Mini Mental State score &lt; 24/30 . ii ) Diagnosis dementia mild cognitive impairment ii ) Acute illness iii ) Side effect medication drug intoxication iv ) Evident musculo−skeletal neurological deficit likely contribute postural instability 2 . Any individual poor written/spoken English include study due need complete multiple questionnaire . 3 . Individuals know history epilepsy last one year currently experience migraine include study due use optokinetic stimulus .</criteria>
