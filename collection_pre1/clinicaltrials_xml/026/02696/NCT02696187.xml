	<detailed_description>Pulmonary rehabilitation cornerstone management patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) include self-management strategy exercise training . Pulmonary rehabilitation show decrease dyspnea , improve physical capacity , level physical activity health-related quality life . Traditionally patient COPD treat pulmonary medical department hospital . However , due change Swedish health system patient mainly treat primary care . Though , pulmonary rehabilitation program still mainly offer hospital . Our research group perform survey hospital treat patient COPD Sweden . The investigator find less half percent COPD population take part pulmonary rehabilitation 2011 . Moreover , recent survey study perform Swedish primary care setting find physiotherapist available patient COPD positive . However , 10 % patient COPD access physiotherapy disease . Consequently urgent need find new strategy facilitate provision pulmonary rehabilitation primary care provide people COPD . The component include pulmonary rehabilitation consider health promotion intervention . Health promotion intervention important part primary care 's assignment/mission Sweden order stress responsibility intervention direct people COPD , choose use term health promotion intervention instead pulmonary rehabilitation . Even though strong scientific evidence beneficial effect health promote intervention include physical exercise self-management strategy , limited proportion people COPD get access service primary care . There obvious need find way implement available knowledge clinical practice . Accordingly , KOL-webben develop method ( measure/tool ) implement evidence base health promotion intervention facilitate delivery service people COPD . KOL-webben also develop tool support self-management include health promotion among people COPD . The design explorative feasibility study control study baseline assessment , delivery intervention 3 month follow-up two month completion delivery . In order explore best practice , usefulness effect intervention , feasibility data collection recruitment people COPD , process evaluation carry out.Two primary health care unit county council VÃ¤sterbotten northern Sweden four primary unit county council Dalarna Mid Sweden include study . The unit represent rural urban setting . KOL-webben interactive web-based system direct towards two target group ; people COPD health care professional . The section direct towards people COPD provide tool improve health literacy thereby promote enable healthier lifestyle specific focus 1 ) increase physical activity 2 ) use appropriate self-management strategy . The tool include educational material , use ( e.g . text , image , movie , web-links ) interactive component ( e.g . ability report step per day symptom feedback ) adapt different stage disease . The section direct towards health care professional include tool aim improve knowledge , attitude confidence provide evidence base health promotion intervention . The tool include easily accessible knowledge material ( e.g . movie , screen test , image , power point presentation patient education exercise program ) .The control group recruit health care unit among listed patient plan visit within 3 month intervention period . The control group receive intervention . - All person COPD visit primary care centre study period constitute sample intervention group ( KOL-webben ) . - The control group recruit primary health care unit among listed patient plan visit within 3 month intervention period - A subgroup 40 person ( 8 unit ) include additional assessment accord following : measure physical activity , measure physical activity process evaluation , process evaluation alone . The subgroup consecutively recruit among visit primary care centre . Measures physical activity also make similar size subgroup participant control group . Before three month intervention period effect impact COPD daily life , health literacy , confidence manage COPD , aspects physical activity , self-efficacy perform physical activity , quality life , dyspnea level physical activity collect . In addition determine effect instrumental conceptual knowledge among health professional</detailed_description>
