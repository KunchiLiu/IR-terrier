	<brief_title>Quality Recovery After Local Infiltration Under General Anesthesia Via Laryngeal Mask Spinal Anesthesia Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal hernia repair one commonly perform operation worldwide . The recommended treatment surgery , undergone important advance last two decade . Different anesthetic technique propose carrying procedure , include local anesthesia , regional general . Even though local anesthesia ( call monitor anesthesia care ) cost effective anesthetic technique inguinal hernia repair , general spinal anesthesia remain popular anesthetic technique university base teaching program . It suggest use local anesthetic technique require great surgical skill handle tissue , therefore , less skilled surgeon find convenient operate general spinal anesthesia . The choice anesthesia influence several factor , include surgeon anesthesiologist preference , patient characteristic , cost length hospital stay . Despite popularity , spinal anesthesia lead side effect urinary retention , hypotension , motor block low extremity headache . A recent systematic review evaluate study influence anesthetic technique control occurrence postoperative pain patient undergoing inguinal hernia repair . According author , local anesthesia , without general anesthesia effective consider avoidance adverse event compare spinal anesthesia . Traditionally , anesthesia surgery study assess outcome time wake hospital stay incidence nausea , vomit , pain adverse event . Recently , measurement probe quality life perspective patient consider important factor clinical study wish investigate effect anesthesia surgery patient recovery satisfaction . The Quality Recovery-40 questionnaire ( QoR-40 ) , validate instrument purpose , allow objective evaluation factor influence perception patient , use successfully assess degree recovery several different surgical anesthetic technique . There recent data application instrument assess anesthetic technique , local infiltration general anesthesia via laryngeal mask spinal anesthesia , would provide good quality recovery opinion patient undergoing inguinal hernia repair . The aim study perform randomize clinical trial compare quality recovery local infiltration general anesthesia via laryngeal mask spinal anesthesia unilateral inguinal hernia repair . METHODS This randomized trial approve Research Ethics Committee School Medical Health Sciences , Pontifical Catholica University São Paulo , approval number 45087615.0.0000.5373 . Written consent form obtain participant . Seventy patient age 18 65 year old , American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status I II , bee schedule undergo local infiltration general anesthesia via laryngeal mask spinal anesthesia unilateral inguinal hernia repair Santa Lucinda Hospital enrol study . Patients ( ) refuse participate study ; ( ii ) able communicate due alteration level consciousness , neurologic , psychiatric disease ; ( iii ) present contraindication drug use present study ; ( iv ) history alcohol drug dependence ; ( v ) super obese define body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 40 ; ( vi ) undergo operation recurrent , strangulate , incarcerated bilateral hernia exclude study . Study Sequence No premedication apply patient . Patients´ preoperative data include age , gender , physical status , BMI hernia type accord Nyhus classification collect Randomization The sample size follow step calculate consider 90 % power detect 10-point difference QoR-40 , indicate need include 31 participant group . Taking possible loss consideration , final sample include 70 participant , allocate two group accord random number sequence web-based random-number generator ( available www.random.com ) . Because significant difference anesthetic technique , patient investigator blind group allocation , anesthesia . The anesthetic technique use individual participant keep opaque seal envelope , open time surgery . Anesthesia On arrival operating room , standard ASA monitor apply . Intravenous midazolam ( 0.06 0.08 mg.kg-1 ) 1 % lidocaine ( 30 mg ) administer immediately venoclysis . The anesthesia perform accord follow sequence : L Group - General anesthesia willl induce propofol 2 mg mg. kg-1 alfentanyl 30 mcg.kg-1 . Once appropriate depth anesthesia obtain , laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) position . The anesthesia maintain propofol 4 5 mg. kg-1.h-1 . Ventilation control adjust flow volume respiratory rate keep end-tidal CO2 level ( PETCO2 ) 30 40 mmHg . For local anesthesia , approximately 50 ml 0.5 % ropivacaine infiltrate along line incision subcutaneous plane , follow peripheral nerve block technique ( e.g. , ilioinguinal-hypogastric nerve block ) local wound infiltration fascial level . Failure local anesthesia define presence movement , sweating , tachycardia blood pressure increase &gt; 10 % pre-induction value begin surgery . In case infiltration additional 10 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine allow . At end surgery , propofol discontinue LMA remove whenever patient resume adequate spontaneous breathing . S Group - In S group , spinal puncture perform patient sit position , use 27 Gauge ( 27G ) disposable Quincke needle ( B. Braun , Meisungen , AG ) . After obtain cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) , 15 mg 0.5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine inject . In case complete failure , new puncture perform dose anesthetic drug inject . In case partial failure , anesthesia convert general anesthesia patient exclude study . All patient sedate propofol continuous infusion initial dose 0.5 mg.kg-1 follow 2 5 mg. kg-1.h-1 necessary reach level 5 Ramsay Sedation Scale . The Lichtenstein tension-free method inguinal hernia repair use group procedure perform surgical team . Patients exhibit reduction systolic arterial pressure ( SAP ) great 30 % give ephedrine ( 10 mg ) . Lactated Ringer 's solution use fluid replacement therapy rate approximately 500 ml throughout first 30 minute , , , 2 ml.kg-1.h-1 . All participant give i.v . ketoprofen ( 100 mg ) end surgery . The time operate room discharge register . Postoperative When stable vital sign respiration confirm , patient transfer post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . Data relate occurrence pain , nausea , vomit , shiver , urinary retention length stay PACU record . Pain assess every 15 minute use 0-10 numeric pain rating scale , zero meant pain 10 bad imaginable pain . Intravenous morphine ( 1 2 mg ) administer every 15 minute maintain pain score 4 ( 1 mg pain score &lt; 7 2 mg ≥7 ) . Postoperative pain relief ward accomplish i.v . ketoprofen ( 100 mg ) every 12 hour , dipyrone ( 30 mg.kg-1 , maximum 1 g ) every six hour tramadol ( 100 mg ) eight-hour minimum interval need whenever patient judge analgesia insufficient . Postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) treat i.v . dimenhydrinate ( 30 mg ) . Pain score , use analgesic , occurrence nausea , vomit , complication hospital ward stay record . QoR-40 Questionnaire The quality postoperative functional recovery assess QoR-40 questionnaire , assess five dimension recovery ( physical comfort - 12 item ; emotional state - 7 item ; physical independence - 5 item ; physiological support - 7 item ; pain - 7 item ) . Each item rat five-point Likert scale : none time , time , usually , time , time . The total score QoR-40 range 40 ( poor quality recovery ) 200 ( best quality recovery ) .</detailed_description>
