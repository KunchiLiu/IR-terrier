	<brief_summary>The investigator plan test innovative , home-based , short duration , high intensity exercise program design application immediate post-hospitalization period old Veterans . Preliminary data suggest intensive approach physical therapy older adult hospitalization safe maximize mobility usual care . The Veterans participate high intensity exercise program receive therapy utilizing high resistance exercise . Outcomes group compare data collect patient receive standard , low resistance therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Function Older Veterans With Hospital-Associated Deconditioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hospital associate deconditioning common profound contributor functional decline old adult . Skeletal muscle weakness atrophy commonly observe old adult deconditioning hospitalization , lead chronic functional deficit . This especially concern elderly Veterans , population tends suffer chronic condition decrease physical function general old adult population . Therefore , Veterans may even high risk develop disability activity daily live hospitalization homebound . Home health physical therapy may ideal venue address functional decline around 3 million old adult receive home health service follow hospital discharge . These service , however , tend low intensity appear adequately address deficit function performance home community mobility . To address concern , investigator develop tested innovative , short-duration , home-based , high intensity exercise program design application immediately follow hospitalization . This protocol dose twelve therapy visit course 30 day determine whether visit frontloading effect outcome . The investigator use series high resistance therapy exercise follow acute hospitalization determine progressive high intensity therapy sustainability improve physical function standard home health physical therapy acute hospitalization old Veterans . Outcomes spotlight physical function , community mobility , Activities Daily Living , quality life , cognition .</detailed_description>
