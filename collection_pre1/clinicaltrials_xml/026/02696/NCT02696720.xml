	<brief_summary>Phantom limb pain ( PLP ) scar hyperalgesia ( SH ) frequent problem amputation ; particular person undergo limb amputation experience phantom pain . The neuropathic nature PLP suggest involvement peripheral central neurological mechanism , include neuroplastic change central nervous system . PLP central nervous system-related pain syndrome remain challenge treatment . Scar hyperalgesia involve peripheral mechanism result frim production substance liberate damaged skin cell . These inflammatory substance low pain threshold alter chemical environment skin nerve ending . Scan hyperalgesia associate secondary mechanical hyperalgesia skin area around scar . The lidocaine patch 5 % topical analgesic act block sodium channel peripheral nerve ending inhibit ectopic discharge sensitize hyperactive cutaneous nociceptors . The patch noninvasive , minimal systemic absorption result reduce risk drug-drug interaction . In addition , central analgesic effect lidocaine suggest . The lidocaine patch 5 % currently license treatment symptomatic postherpetic neuralgia . It also successfully used patient neuropathic pain state , entrapment neuropathy , painful idiopathic distal sensory polyneuropathies postoperative/post traumatic neuropathic chronic cutaneous pain . The lidocaine patch study management prevention phantom limb pain . The aim present research investigate lidocaine patch 5 % effective reducing PLP primary/secondary scar hyperalgesia . The hypothesis persistent peripheral nociceptive input stump surgery may drive maladaptive cortical reorganization lead chronic central pain thus promote chronic phantom limb pain . Treating scar hyperalgesia stump topical lidocaine may reduce activity peripheral nociceptive afferent thus decrease likelihood develop persistent phantom limb pain . This study design randomize control multicentric double blind trial , effectiveness apply 5 % lidocaine patch 6 week compare sham .</brief_summary>
