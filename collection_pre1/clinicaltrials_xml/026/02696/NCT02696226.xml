	<brief_title>Frequency Reduced Leaflet Motion After Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot prospective randomize control trial.The study enroll 50 adult patient schedule undergo SAVR 50 adult patient schedule undergo TAVR . Subjects satisfy Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria approach informed consent . Those give informed consent enrol . After induction anesthesia , computer program use randomize patient one 2 treatment group . 1 . SAVR patient get either Warfarin aspirin 2 . TAVR patient get either Warfarin aspirin . Patients see 4-6 week postoperatively Transthoracic ECHO ( TTE ) , 4 dimensional ( 4D ) , Multidetector compute tomography ( MDCT ) scan review medical history . Phone follow 6,9 12 month post-operatively . Data pilot study enable u determine feasibility large randomize control clinical trial investigate phenomenon reduce leaflet motion/subclinical valve thrombosis , possibly , clinical importance</detailed_description>
