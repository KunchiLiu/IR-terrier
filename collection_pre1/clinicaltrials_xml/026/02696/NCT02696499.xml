	<detailed_description>The symptom score determine eligibility establish Screening Period ( 4 week ) eligible patient randomly allocate 2:1 ratio active placebo arm baseline visit ( Week 0 ) . During Treatment Period , clinic visit occur end Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 7 . Following completion Treatment Period , patient enter 2-week Washout Period treatment arm . Routine hemodialysis treatment continue accord dialysis unit 's standard practice patient . Patients allow continue use daily dose pre-randomization H1 antihistamine well daily dos allow medication throughout study . Blood sample collect various biomarkers . In subset patient , additional blood sample collect pharmacokinetic assessment . Clinical safety assessment perform clinic visit .</detailed_description>
