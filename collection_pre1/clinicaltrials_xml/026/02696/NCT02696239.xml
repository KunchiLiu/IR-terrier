	<brief_title>Vaginal Cuff Closure Robotic Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Robotic assist laparoscopic surgery fast grow new modality gynecologic surgery . Surgeons adapt perform benign oncologic gynecologic procedure . Therefore , fast grow robotic procedure united state hysterectomy . The literature laparoscopic hysterectomy , robotic non-robotic , report complication vaginal closure disruption hysterectomy high abdominal surgery . Reasons hypothesize phenomenon include colpotomy ( vaginal incision ) technique , vaginal closure technique , type suture . At present , follow study do test hypothesis . In light rapid adoption approach hysterectomy , data issue help physician counseling patient regard complication , well help surgeon choose material technique hysterectomy diminish chance unfortunate complication , cause pain , hospitalization excess morbidity original surgery . Additionally , parallel development newer suture material , so-called `` barb '' self-anchoring suture , typically fabricate monofilament material , report used laparoscopic hysterectomy case series . The relative contribution thesis newer material rate cuff disruption unknown . The protocol propose test null hypothesis different suture material method closure cause significant difference rate vaginal cuff disruption robotic assist laparoscopic total hysterectomy . Study design prospective randomize controlled trial . Patients blindly randomize one 3 closure technique use 3 different material . Technique material necessity blind surgeon . Otherwise , standard surgical technique use . Followup 2 6 week clinical assessment perform . To ass long term cuff disruption , 12 month interview also conduct . Data point include operative time closure , postoperative pain 2 6 week , postoperative pain urination/voiding 2 6 week , spot , bleed /or frank vaginal disruption document 2 6 week , pain presence dyspareunia 12 month assess . Cost associate cuff closure calculate addition OR time material cost .</detailed_description>
