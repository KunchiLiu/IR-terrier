	<brief_summary>This study propose use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( FMRI ) observe brain activity behavior associate decision-making reward ( DD task ) , work memory work memory cognitive persistence ( WM task ) , crave ( CR task ) 72 opiate dependent participant initiate buprenorphine . While stably use opiate ( initial study appointment ) withdrawal ( approximately 3 day later ) , participant receive FMRI scan behavioral challenge ; immediately second FMRI , receive first dose buprenorphine . Buprenorphine treatment continue twelve week , follow four week taper . Urine toxicological analysis perform prior first scan session , weekly two week biweekly thereafter . Participation individual last 4 month . Assessments occur baseline , week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 . Buprenorphine induction begin completion second scan ; follow-up medical visit align study assessment week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 12 . All participant receive 16 week buprenorphine ( final 4 16 week include taper ) .</brief_summary>
