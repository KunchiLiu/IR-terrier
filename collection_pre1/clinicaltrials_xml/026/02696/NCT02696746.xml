	<detailed_description>Very little currently know sensory characteristic central process pain patient heritable channelopathies . The investigator carefully study phenotype patient term pain symptomatology , sensory processing reveal quantitative sensory test correlate genotype . In select patient investigator perform skin biopsy determine whether evidence damage small fibre would also like generate fibroblast neural crest stem cell culture future study molecular basis channel dysfunction . The study provide new insight peripheral central nervous system mechanism involve process pain . The investigator restrict channelopathies cause somatic pain syndrome investigate migraine . The following condition consider : Erythromelalgia , Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder , Familial episodic pain syndrome , patient episodic pain symptom cause found patient reduce pain sensibility . 1.2.1 Quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) QST method accurately determine sensory threshold human skin particularly useful determine dysfunction nociceptive small diameter nerve fibre , although precise utility QST routine clinical neuropathic pain management perhaps require evaluation . There also increase interest use QST combination assessment pain descriptor give insight underlie pathophysiological mechanism chronic pain . For example , presence brush evoke dynamic allodynia indicate sensitisation spinal level . The investigator use standardize protocol developed german neuropathic pain consortium great experience . Only limited study perform inherited painful channelopathies assess sensory function . The investigator correlate finding QST pain symptom quality life . The investigator would like see specific abnormality sensory processing associate particular channelopathies . 1.2.2 Skin biopsy . Measurement intra epidermal nerve fibre density ( IENFD ) relatively simple assay perform relatively innocuous 3mm punch biopsy skin , routine dermatological investigation . Its utility assessment small fibre function peripheral neuropathy clear . Peripheral neuropathy diverse aetiology associate reduce epidermal innervation density . The investigator extensive experience technique minimal morbidity would like establish painful channelopathies whether anatomy C-fibres innervate skin normal . Patients opt still include study . Fibroblasts culture 4mm skin biopsy ( obtain describe ) . These represent useful tool future source cell phenotype modulate instance generate induce pluripotent stem cell follow induction neural crest differentiation order understand molecular basis alter pain perception . A approach isolate neural crest stem cell directly hair follicle technique pioneer Prof Sieber-Blum Newcastle University . The investigator subsequently aim generate sensory neuron cell compare behaviour sensory neuron control subject generate patient heritable pain syndrome . 1.2.3 Electrodiagnostic test Electrodiagnostic test : These assess integrity peripheral large nerve fibre . Nerve conduction study ( NCS ) use extensively clinical practice diagnose peripheral neuropathy safe procedure integrity axon myelin sheath test use external electrical stimulus . Threshold track technique , electrical threshold nerve respond electrical stimulation , also use study peripheral nerve . If NCS perform part patient 's routine medical care result record . Microneurography : Traditional nerve conduction study detect activity large nerve fibre . To record small nerve fibre investigator may perform microneurography . This minimally invasive technique activity single nerve fibre record peripheral nerve directly detect function pain fibres peripheral nerve human . In test thin micro-electrode place next nerve fibre . This provide direct mean directly record C-fibre activity human . J Serra co-investigator study long track record use microneurography . 1.2.4 Chemical challenge measure axon reflex condition sensory nervous system As mean assess physiological integrity peripheral C fiber patient suffer unusual pain syndrome reduce pain sensitivity investigator elicit axon reflex . This reflex involve transcutaneous application agent histamine via iontophoresis . The histamine stimulate peripheral nerve ending small diameter C fibre . Their stimulation induces vasodilatation , visible flare response skin . The evaluation extent flare response use indication integrity small diameter C fibre population . If subject allergy exclude test . Conditioning challenge intervention sensitise peripheral nociceptive system way nociceptive system either respond vigorously noxious stimulus ( hyperalgesia ) respond non-noxious stimulus ( allodynia ) . The manner peripheral nociceptive system respond provide important information physiological functioning peripheral nociceptor system . The investigator apply establish conditioning challenge subject ' skin . Topical application capsaicin mustard oil well validate , establish safe conditioning challenge sensitise peripheral nociceptors . Prof. David Bennett 's group extensive experience use conditioning challenge . In study date investigate alteration peripheral fibre condition challenge heritable pain syndrome , mustard oil cause increased area hyperalgesia individual Familial Episodic Pain Syndrome compare unaffected individual . Applying stimulus could lead minor skin irritation use history skin allergy/sensitivity . In practice perform test hundred time problem . 1.2.5 Imaging Human Brain Pain The advent functional imaging technique allow researcher begin look within human brain observe pain look like brain . Initially , pain image research determine pain process single brain region instead engage several distributed cortical area . The group brain region active pain commonly refer 'pain matrix ' . This include : primary secondary somatosensory cortex ( SI , SII ) , insular , anterior cingulate , prefrontal cortex thalamus . However , pain purely sensory event also reflective person feel pain . Factors vary widely across population memory , emotion , pathology , genetics , cognitive factor directly affect individual experience pain . In addition , way person respond pain modify heavily appropriate situation . For example , person pain may hide unpleasant sensation uncomfortable surroundings . Because , pain matrix provide incomplete picture happen brain pain . Pain imaging study begin validate perspective . For example , Derbyshire collaborator show activation key pain matrix region even subject pain . From study look chronic pain sufferer , show series key brain region active outside pain matrix . It essential brain image research update notion 'pain matrix ' account inconsistency . 1.2.6 Psychological co-morbidity , quality life pain Whilst study examine aspect pain context nerve injury ( rarely relation inherit channelopathies ) , go beyond simple measurement pain intensity sensory characteristic limited literature explore interaction pain , psychological status quality life . Neuropathic pain general associate multiple psychological problem impact upon quality life . These include circadian rhythm disturbance ( e.g . sleep difficulty : moderate severe 60 % patient ) , lack energy ( 55 % ) , drowsiness ( 39 % ) difficulty concentration ( 36 % ) ; similar finding specifically document erythromelalgia . A poor health perception , poor physical functioning , high prevalence role limitation ( physical emotional ) , well , depressive symptom ( base pain catastrophising scale Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ) find patient Erythromelalgia . In general , beliefs fear concern pain implication contribute substantially determine mood behaviour . Since neuropathic pain relatively common context peripheral neuropathy question arises extent pain driver co-morbidities - answer know , large randomise controlled trial analgesic intervention neuropathic pain state indicate pain intensity reduce severity co-morbidities . To answer question investigator first need identify specific tool measurement neuropathic pain co-morbidity context painful channelopathies one aim proposal evaluate variety exist assessment tool . Another issue likely psychological co-morbidity influence self report pain intensity , usual primary outcome measure clinical trial neuropathic pain analgesic agent . The investigator use battery psychological instrument determine psychological quality life subject painful channelopathies . 1.2.7 Blood sample The investigator collect blood sample ( 30mls ) subject , store -80 degree Celsius lock freezer . They sequence know gene associate painful channelopathies : SCN9a TRPA1 . The investigator store DNA order possible candidate gene associate pain test .</detailed_description>
