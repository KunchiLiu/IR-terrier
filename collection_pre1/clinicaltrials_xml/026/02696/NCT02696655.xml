	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Liver transplantation effective treatment decompensated chronic liver disease associate improvement life expectancy quality life ( 1 ) . Recent advance immunosuppressive therapy ; great surgical anaesthetic expertise optimise risk assessment procedure show associated improvement 90 day , 1 5 year survival ( 2 ) . However , non-liver cause death increase malignancy ( 22 % ) , cardiovascular disease ( 11 % ) , infection ( 9 % ) renal failure ( 6 % ) become lead cause death one year ( 3 ) It well recognise liver transplantation associate onset number condition increase risk early mortality , include new onset diabetes , hypertension dyslipidaemia ( 4,5 ) . These condition potential prevent improved behavioural intervention target health lifestyle behaviour include physical activity , diet , smoke medication adherence ( 6 ) . Lifestyle factor central survival wait list long-term post transplant survival . Therefore important support patient make positive sustainable lifestyle behaviour change . However , represent complex medical challenge rarely clinical team train target lifestyle behaviour change meaningful/personalised way . AIMS OF THE STUDY The aim develop behavioural intervention use medical personnel involve care patient assessed transplantation , whilst list transplantation post transplantation improve long-term outcome . The intervention co-developed clinician patient ensure fit purpose . Healthcare professional train target range health lifestyle behaviour use evidence-based behavioural strategy . It hop lead improvement long-term survival reduce modifiable risk factor mortality . OBJECTIVES This study develop assess acceptability feasibility multifaceted behaviour change intervention . The intervention design train healthcare professional use behavioural strategy target key lifestyle behaviour context liver transplantation , equip patient behavioural skill make positive change range lifestyle behaviour . In reality , could cost effective model able enable lifestyle change transplant patient . These healthcare professional front line staff work high volume transplant patient . PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION Is multifaceted behavioural intervention co-developed healthcare professional patient acceptable feasible deliver faithfully routine clinical practice ? Objectives The objective study : - ) To co-develop evidence-based , multifaceted behavioural intervention delivery routine clinical consultation ii ) To develop train programme equips clinician knowledge , skill confidence deliver behavioural intervention routine clinical practice iii ) To determine whether behavioural intervention acceptable feasible healthcare professional patient iv ) To assess whether behavioural intervention deliver faithfully routine clinical practice v ) To optimise behavioural intervention base feedback clinicians patient . vi ) To assess whether intervention impact positively clinical outcome ( e.g. , blood pressure , HbA1c level ) vii ) To inform design large randomise controlled trial appropriate</detailed_description>
