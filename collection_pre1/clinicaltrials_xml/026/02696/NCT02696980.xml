	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effect increase lung volume simple hand-held device prevent , also relieve , airway constriction people asthma BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 . Twenty people late onset non-allergic asthma BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 recruit . The efficacy elevate lung volume prevent reverse bronchoconstriction test . Lung volume modulate breathe small level resistance ( positive expiratory pressure ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study investigate whether PEEP prevent and/or reverse bronchoconstriction asthmatic BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 . People late-onset non-allergic asthma develop set obesity respond well conventional asthma medication , likely treatment asthma developed treat early-onset allergic disease lean patient . There critical need understand pathophysiology airway disease late-onset , non-allergic obese asthmatic , order develop therapy target disease . Airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) define characteristic asthma . Lung function test individual late onset asthma set obesity suggestive distal airway closure rather airway narrow cause hyperresponsiveness ; individual tend collapsible lung periphery obese individual develop asthma . If late onset asthma obesity relate tendency airway close , respond therapy design keep airway open , Positive End-Expiratory Pressure ( PEEP ) . The purpose study investigate efficacy PEEP prevention reversal bronchoconstriction obese people asthma . This achieve investigate efficacy PEEP therapy prevent reverse bronchoconstriction response inhalation methacholine , measure change respiratory impedance use force oscillation method . Participants initially perform conventional methacholine challenge test . Participants return 2 visit methacholine administer concurrently vary level PEEP ( use PEEP prevent bronchoconstriction ) measuring change respiratory impedance use force oscillation method . Participants return another 2 visit PEEP administer subsequent methacholine challenge ( use PEEP reverse bronchoconstriction ) measuring change respiratory impedance use force oscillation method . These study complete 5 visit .</detailed_description>
