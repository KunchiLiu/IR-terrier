	<brief_title>Study Artemether-lumefantrine , Amodiaquine Primaquine Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design open-label pharmacokinetic study healthy G6PD normal Thai subject . This study enroll 16 healthy subject . Participants pass screen process 6 admission hospital receive 6 drug regimen First admission visit : The subject may randomize receive either Artemether-Lumefantrine Amodiaquine 6-10 week washout period . Second admission visit : Subject receive Artemether-Lumefantrine previous visit receive amodiaquine visit vice versa . This visit require 6-10 week washout period . Third admission visit : Every subject receive Artemether-lumefantrine Amodiaquine 6-10 week washout period . Forth admission visit : Every subject receive Primaquine 1-5 week washout period . Fifth admission visit : Subject may randomize receive either Artemether-Lumefantrine Primaquine Artemether-Lumefantrine Amodiaquine Primaquine visit 6-10 week washout period . Sixth admission visit : Subject receive Artemether-Lumefantrine Amodiaquine primaquine previous visit receive Artemether-Lumefantrine Primaquine visit vice versa .</detailed_description>
