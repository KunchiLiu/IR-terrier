	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common peripheral entrapment neuropathy involve compression median nerve carpal tunnel . Rather progressive disease , CTS characterize remission recurrence . Although many conservative management CTS , effectiveness method insignificant persist short duration . The platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) new potential treatment patient kinds musculoskeletal disorder recent report show beneficial peripheral neuropathy animal study . Since 2014 , two small clinical trial show positive effect PRP peripheral neuropathy . One study show PRP therapeutic effect peripheral neuropathy patient leprosy . In addition , PRP protective effect neurological deficit facial nerve superficial parotidectomy . However , study entirely prove effect PRP peripheral neuropathy study enrol small number patient lack controlled design . In addition , PRP use treat CTS far . The investigator design randomize , double-blind , control trail ass effect ultrasound-guided PRP injection patient CTS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain write informed consent , patient clinically diagnosed CTS randomize intervention control group . Participants intervention group receive one-dose ultrasound-guided PRP injection control group receive one-dose ultrasound-guided 5 % dextrose injection . No additional treatment injection study period . The primary outcome visual analog scale ( VAS ) secondary outcome include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) , cross-sectional area ( CSA ) median nerve , sensory nerve conduction velocity median nerve , finger pinch strength . The evaluation perform pretreatment well 2nd , 4th , 8th , 12th , 16th 24th week treatment .</detailed_description>
