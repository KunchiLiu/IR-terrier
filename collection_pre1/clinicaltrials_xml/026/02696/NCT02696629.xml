	<brief_summary>The prevalence OSA 3.5~4.6 % Chinese adult . OSA lead repetitive hypoxemia , hypercapnia , arousal sleep independent risk factor hypertension , stroke , coronary artery disease congestive heart failure . CPAP first-line treatment OSA . But many patient adhere therapy . The upper airway ( UA ) anatomical abnormality prominent risk factor Asian OSA patient , might improve surgical strategy . However , surgery show variable clinical effectiveness . One important reason patient respond poorly single treatment procedure multiple abnormal physiological trait contribute OSA . High loop gain one key non-anatomical risk factor . It useful individualize therapy OSA well understanding reversibility increase LG , interaction LG UA anatomical change well condition trigger reduction LG . The project test hypothesis 1 ) Elevated LG induce patient reversible treatment OSA ; 2 ) Change LG relate improvement sleep apnea ; 3 ) An elevate LG related residual sleep apnea upper airway surgery , might eliminate adjunct CPAP therapy surgery . The result would improve efficiency non-CPAP treatment provide potential combined treatment option patient elevate loop gain anatomy risk factor Asian population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Unstable respiratory control ( high loop gain ) important non-anatomical risk factor obstructive sleep apnea . Studies show high loop gain might also acquire long-term hypoxemia/hypercapnia due OSA , could decrease CPAP therapy individual . Whether another treatment , i.e . upper airway surgery , could achieve similar improvement know . We hypothesize 1 ) high LG could reversible improved hypoxemia reduce apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) surgical treatment ; 2 ) high loop gain baseline may associate poor treatment outcome . PSG perform pre- postoperatively assess OSA severity participant underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty concomitant transpalatal advancement pharyngoplasty . Loop gain calculate use publish method fit feedback control model airflow . The loop gain value baseline follow-up compare . The association loop gain change improvement OSA analyze .</detailed_description>
