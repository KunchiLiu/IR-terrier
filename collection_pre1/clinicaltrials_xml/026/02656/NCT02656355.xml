	<brief_summary>Gait initiation ( GI ) difficulty common people Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Studies show GI difficulty relate impaired anticipatory postural adjustment ( APA ) . In healthy people , two phase APA relate center pressure ( COP ) shift observe GI . In people PD , delay decrease amplitude APA abnormal multiple APAs observe GI . Conventional balance test record maximum displacement and/or velocity Center pressure ( COP ) . However , variable could show performance APA . Previous study suggest balance gait initiation control separate neural circuitry . This could explain conventional COP measurement correlate GI well . It important develop GI related APA test training . Researchers find perturbation apply COP displacement GI could delay GI APA . This indicate COP displacement APA component . Our pilot study show reverse direction COP displacement voluntary COP displacement , suggest existence APA . This three year project evaluate relationship APA voluntary COP displacement APA GI , establish APA test PD , investigate effect APA training GI people PD . In first year , 20 people without disability recruit . The APA voluntary COP displacement test , APA GI , gait performance evaluate . In second year , 15 people PD 15 healthy people recruit . Subjects receive GI test , gait test , APA voluntary COP displacement test . The relationship different type APA establish PD healthy people . In third year , 30 people PD randomize APA train group , balance group , control group . The different training effect evaluate especially GI , gait performance , freeze gait . This project advance knowledge mechanism GI difficulty . The result project apply clinical rehabilitation people GI difficulty .</brief_summary>
