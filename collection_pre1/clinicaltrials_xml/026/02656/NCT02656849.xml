	<brief_summary>This research study study whether new experimental cancer study drug BAY 1000394 helpful treat solid tumor cancer abnormality one follow gene : Mcl-1 , Myc CCNE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BAY 1000394 MCL-1- , MYC- , CCNE1-Amplified Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . - `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , drug effective treat different type cancer . - It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve BAY 1000394 use participant type cancer . - The study drug pan-CDK inhibitor target genetic defect several tumor , MCL1 , Myc , CCNE .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients must advance cancer curative therapy exist malignancy match one follow cohort : MCL1 amplification ( ≥ 3 fold ) ; MYC amplification ( ≥ 6 fold ) ; CCNE1 amplification ( ≥ 6 fold ) . Molecular abnormality may detect CLIAcertified test , include Massive Parallel ( NextGeneration ) sequence platform . Patients must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 criterion . In selected case patient evaluable disease may eligible discussion PI Bayer . Participants must complete least one line therapy advanced/metastatic setting prior enrollment Participants advanced disease approve secondline option exist eligible progressed beyond approved secondline therapy Age ≥ 18 year . Because data evaluate compound pediatric population , appropriate clinical trial conduct future specific population . ECOG performance status 01 ( Karnofsky ≥70 % , see Appendix A ) Life expectancy great 12 week Adequate bone marrow , liver , renal function assess follow laboratory requirement : Hemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥2 x 10/9/L Platelet count ≥100 x 10/9/L Total bilirubin ≤1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≤2.5 x ULN ( ≤5 x ULN subject liver involvement cancer ) Prothrombin timeinternational normalize ratio ( PTINR ) partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 x ULN Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) ≥60 mL/min per 1.73 m/2 accord CockcroftGault formula Negative serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) ( perform within 7 day randomization ) . Negative result must available prior study treatment administration Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate barrier birth control measure time sign informed consent form least 3 month last study drug administration .

Postmenopausal woman define : Age &gt; 50 year amenorrhea least 12 month Age ≤50 year 6 month spontaneous amenorrhea follicle stimulate hormone level within postmenopausal range ( &gt; 40 mIU/mL ) Bilateral oophorectomy Additional adequate contraception include hormonal contraception implant combine oral contraceptive , certain intrauterine device , bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy , vasectomy partner allow long barrier method also use Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Prior radiotherapy permit must occur ≥2 week ( palliative radiotherapy ) ≥ 4 week ( curative radiotherapy ) subject must Grade 3 4 toxicity prior first dose study treatment Prior chemotherapy allow . Patients must receive chemotherapy 3 week prior initiation study treatment must full recovery acute effect prior chemotherapy . Patients must nitrosoureas mitomycin C 6 week prior initiation study treatment . Prior exposure approve receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor permit . At least 5 halflives must elapse since completion kinase inhibitor initiation study treatment . Prior experimental ( nonFDA approve ) therapy immunotherapies allow . Patients must receive therapy 4 week prior initiation study treatment must full recovery acute effect therapy . Participants must receive pancyclindependent kinase inhibitor prior therapy . Current ongoing administration anticoagulation antiplatelet therapy . However , use lowdose aspirin ( ≤100 mg/day ) and/or lowdose heparin permit unless use condition cancer Known hypersensitivity study treatment excipients preparation agent give association study Previous deep vein thrombosis ( within last 6 month ) , arterial thrombotic event ( include stroke ) , pulmonary embolism History cardiac disease : Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV angina ( within past 6 month prior study entry ) , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy ( beta blocker digoxin permit ) Known human immunodeficiency virus infection , active hepatitis B C , chronic hepatitis B C require treatment antiviral therapy Active clinically serious infection NCICTCAE v4.0 &gt; Grade 2 Seizure disorder require therapy ( steroids antiepileptic ) Concomitant use medication know low seizure threshold Symptomatic metastatic brain meningeal tumor , include spinal cord , include case neoplastic meningitis ( also know carcinomatous meningitis leptomeningeal carcinomatosis ) .
