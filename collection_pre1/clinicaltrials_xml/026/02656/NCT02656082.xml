	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Etanercept give intradermal injection effective treatment discoid lupus erythematosus ( DLE ) . The investigator also would like develop new test measure skin inflammation scan affected skin use optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , thermography laser doppler imaging ( LDI ) take photographs rash ( do treatment ) . If findings new test similar one take sample skin ( biopsy ) , latter ( invasive test ) avoid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Therapy Using Intradermal Injection Etanercept Remission Induction Discoid Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There unmet need new therapy control inflammation discoid lupus erythematosus ( DLE ) . A significant proportion DLE patient ( without systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) ) resistant conventional therapy DLE may exacerbate B cell depletion therapy.There clinical guideline algorithm manage patient DLE refractory disease first line agent , anti-malarials . If leave untreated , uncontrolled inflammation lead permanent disfigure irreversible scar patient , thus pose major cosmetic issue significantly impair quality life . Targeted therapy base immunopathogenesis attractive approach tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) implicate pathogenesis DLE . However , systemic administration TNF blocker associate induction pathogenic autoantibody may render SLE bad progression DLE SLE . TNF blocker administer use intra-dermal injection route TNF-mediated disease appear similarly safe effective systemic administration . Another issue problem outcome measure skin disease particularly heterogenous many instrument rely subjective assessment may difficult even hand expert . The TARGET-DLE trial address problem : ( ) administer TNF blocker , etanercept use intra-dermal route , provide local concentration neutralise TNF tissue minimises effect systemic immunity ( ii ) measure tissue response use exist outcome measure ; modify limited Score Activity Damage DLE ( SADDLE ) well new objective measure skin biopsy , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , thermography laser Doppler imaging ( LDI ) . Data study may use power definitive randomise control trial primary end point achieve .</detailed_description>
