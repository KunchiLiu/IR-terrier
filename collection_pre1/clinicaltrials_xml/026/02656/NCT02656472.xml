	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Comparing Anti-Inflammatory Effects Of TXA Versus EACA In Pediatric Congenital Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bleeding cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) one common complication patient undergo pediatric cardiac surgery . The inflammatory response produce CPB factor add significantly morbidity cardiac surgery . A number factor show involved induce inflammatory response . These include complement system activation3 activation inflammatory cytokine , especially IL-1 IL-64 , IL-8 TNF alpha . Tranexamic Acid ( TXA ) Epsilon-Aminocaproic Acid ( EACA ) lysine analogue frequently use anti-fibrinolytic agent patient undergo CPB . Many author highlight role TXA reduce blood loss blood transfusion CPB . Role EACA aprotinin decrease pro-inflammatory response CPB well document adult literature . Patients undergo redo sternotomy high inflammatory response compare patient undergo first cardiac surgery . It also show TXA reduce inflammatory response CPB act directly indirectly inflammatory cytokine . There study directly compare anti-inflammatory property EACA TXA pediatric population undergo CPB . In institution , EACA use standard practice reduce blood loss pediatric cardiac surgery , investigator start use TXA recently . The aim study compare anti-inflammatory anti-fibrinolytic property two anti-fibrinolytic agent pediatric patient undergo CBP cardiac surgery . Hypothesis : Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) well anti-inflammatory profile compare â‚¬-Amino Caproic Acid ( EACA ) may help reduce blood loss , renal injury , hepatic injury blood transfusion CPB Specific Objectives : During redo sternotomy procedure significant anti-inflammatory response occur plays role increase amount chest tube output , blood loss , renal injury , hepatic injury ultimately patient morbidity and/or mortality . The propose study help know antifibrinolytic agent beneficial reduce anti-inflammatory response produce two drug ( EACA TXA ) , good anti-inflammatory profile use similar setting patient undergo pediatric cardiothoracic surgery . Specific Aims : Evaluate whether TXA EACA decrease inflammatory response produce redo sternotomy procedure pediatric patient drug decrease injury and/or cardiac dysfunction reflect fluid balance , inotropic support , diuretic requirement , length ventilator support , length ICU stay , length hospital stay .</detailed_description>
