	<brief_summary>Recent study indicate patient chronic neck pain present decrease activation weak neck muscle , especially deep flexor extensor muscle . Alterations deep associate pain impairment neck function chronic neck pain . Exercise know important component treatment program patient neck pain . Recently , many study focus specific train deep cervical muscle , especially deep cervical flexor deep cervical extensor muscles.Numerous study use cranio-cervical flexor exercise treatment reveal reduction pain , neck disability , change activation deep cervical flexor muscle . Further , cervical extensor muscle believe equally important rehabilitation patient neck pain . However , retention effect semispinalis cervicis exercise unknown . Therefore , semispinalis cervicis exercise still need evidence support clinically effect . The current study conduct fill gap previous study immediately , short , long term effect semispinalis cervicis exercise chronic neck pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Specific Training Deep Neck Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neck pain second common problem musculoskeletal problem low back pain general population.The prevalence neck pain point lifetime general population report 43 66.7 percent.the neck problem could involve physical function , psychological function social function . The economic burden neck pain high.Recent study indicate patient chronic neck pain present decrease activation weak neck muscle , especially deep flexor extensor muscle . Alterations deep associate pain impairment neck function chronic neck pain.Recently , many study focus specific train deep cervical muscle , especially deep cervical flexor deep cervical extensor muscle . The specific training deep cervical muscle aim improve control strategy , improve activation deep cervical flexor muscle optimize movement control segmental motion cervical spine . Numerous study use cranio-cervical flexor exercise treatment reveal reduction pain , neck disability , change activation deep superficial cervical flexor muscle . Further , cervical extensor muscle believe equally important rehabilitation patient neck pain . So , activation deep cervical extensor emphasize management people neck pain . Schomacher et al ( 2012 ) suggest isometric resist exercise second cervical vertebra improve semispinalis cervicis muscle activity neck pain patient . However , retention effect semispinalis cervicis exercise unknown . Therefore , semispinalis cervicis exercise still need evidence support clinically effect . The current study conduct fill gap previous study immediately , short , long term effect semispinalis cervicis exercise chronic neck pain .</detailed_description>
