	<detailed_description>An anterior shoulder dislocation common problem people age 15 35 . Recurrent instability common dependent age gender . Treatment option include surgical intervention repair non-surgical option include intensive rehabilitation . Level I evidence suggest early surgical repair significantly reduce risk recurrent instability . The risk arthritis increase multiple dislocation episode . Traditionally , combination 1 ) history physical exam perform provider , 2 ) clinical diagnostic tool assess extent injury impact physical activity , 3 ) patient-voiced preference guide selection optimal solution individual patient . When provide recommendation individual patient unique circumstance , health care provider may gather patient preference factor desire avoid pain , chance recurrent shoulder dislocation , time need rehabilitation physical therapy , operative versus non-operative cost . Surgical non-surgical option distinct difference outcomes . When combine , interaction variable create important tradeoff risk benefit option .
