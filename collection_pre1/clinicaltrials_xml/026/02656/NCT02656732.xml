	<brief_summary>The present randomized , control , parallel-grouped trial include twenty patient ( age 20 54 year ) suffer Miller 's class I II gingival recession . Patients randomly assign two equal group ; control group ; coronally advance flap subepithelial connective tissue graft ( CAF+SCTG ) test group ; coronally advance flap amnion chorion allograft membrane ( CAF+AC ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The participant randomly assign receive coronally advanced flap ( CAF ) amnion chorion membrane CAF subepithelial connective tissue graft use simple randomization procedure 1:1 allocation ratio . A computer generate randomization list drawn faculty member involve recruitment . Allocation concealment achieve seal coded opaque envelope contain treatment perform enrolled subject base randomized number . Consequently , patient allocate either AC membrane ( intervention ) SCTG ( control ) group . The sealed envelope contain treatment assignment open time surgery number pick another person operator .</detailed_description>
