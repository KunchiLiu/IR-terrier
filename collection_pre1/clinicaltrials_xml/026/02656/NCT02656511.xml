	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify provide immediate antiretroviral therapy cohort HIV-infected individual `` hyperacute '' infection ( estimate date HIV infection within last 30 day ) . The primary aim study evaluate whether initiation dolutegravir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir hyperacute HIV infection lead protection CD4+ T cell peripheral blood gut-associated lymphoid tissue infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immediate Initiation Antiretroviral Therapy During `` Hyperacute '' HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although ART decrease HIV-associated mortality , appear completely restore immune health , reason remain unclear . In addition , HIV prevention approach lead significant success decrease incidence new HIV infection past year , epidemic continue grow locally globally . A synergistic strategy HIV prevention effectively eradicate virus HIV-infected person . While complete eradication may currently feasible , `` functional cure '' patient able indefinitely maintain undetectable viral load absence therapy may attainable immediate goal . Studying hyperacute HIV-infected individual provide unique opportunity investigate pathophysiology early stage HIV infection may help identify virologic/immunologic predictor functional cure .</detailed_description>
