The study physician receive seal decode envelope per treatment , know identity participant , handle study product , know assign treatment , share examination result . After receive evaluation study physician finish investigation form , patient take seal decode envelope go pharmacy clinical trial center receive medication . The staff pharmacy clinical trial center responsible distribution return experimental drug patient . All envelope , seal unsealed , return investigator end study . Patients would require return box whether use unused visit compliance assess count bottle capsule . 4 . Sample size calculation : It report treatment oral iron anemia postpartum woman increase Hb concentration 49.3 % day 40 . Combined etiological treatment , Ejiao compound use treat anemia non pregnant population three month , Hb concentration increase 66.9 % . Basing result literature mention , investigator suppose difference Hb concentration patient receive Ejiao compound 4 week patient receive oral iron 4 week would 25.0 % . The α-value set 0.05 test power 0.90 . The final sample size 68 group . With anticipated dropout rate 20 % follow-up , initial sample size group 85 , 170 total two group . 5 . Statistical analysis : The statistician blind allocation participant . Statistics Package Social Science ( SPSS ) 19.0 statistical software package use analyze data . The intention-to-treat population include randomize patient receive assign treatment least , evaluation outcome . The measurement data analyze use t-test rank sum test , numeration data analyze use chi-square test Fisher 's exact test . P＜0.05 indicate statistical significance .</detailed_description>
