	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label non-comparative , observational patient registry conduct 15 20 clinical site . Patients agree participate sign informed patient consent prior surgery include . Follow-up visit perform following time point : baseline ( pre-and postoperative ) , 6 week , 12 week , 6 month , ( 12 ) month ( patient insufficient sign heal 6 month visit ; otherwise preferable visit ) . To minimize potential bias observational study design , reasonable sample investigator site ( 15-20 site ) , patient ( 200 patient ) select . Furthermore , data analyze independent Contract Research Organization , objective outcome measure use eg , WOMAC , QuickDASH , fracture healing . All data collect electronic case report form ( eCRF ) registry de-identified . Each patient assign unique reference number . eCRFs confidential document available Sponsor ( include Sponsor delegate , like clinical research associate ( CRAs ) , Investigator , investigation statistician , request advisory committee , ethical committee regulatory authority . The key link unique reference number patient keep investigation file Principal Investigator investigation site . Registry procedure : Baseline visit/Pre-Op : - Potential study patient inform study Investigator ( delegate ) - All inclusion exclusion criterion check determine patient participate registry - Prior registry-specific examination , patient give write informed consent ( IC ) IC form place patient 's medical record . A copy IC write patient information hand patient - Collection demographic data , medical history ( Charlson Comorbidity Score ( 49 ; 50 ) ) , concomitant medication , fracture characteristic accident/injury information - Collection X-rays : imaging procedure organize prepared transmission Clinical Research Organization ( CRO ) outline image manual - Documentation study-specific questionnaire ( QuickDASH , WOMAC , EQ-5D ) base report pre-injury status - The data enter eCRF Intra- postoperative procedure : All surgical procedure do per standard care treat institution . Aftercare rehabilitation procedure leave surgeon ' discretion . Follow-up visit : - Post-operative : hospital discharge - 6 week ( 7 - 56 day ) - 12 week ( 57 - 120 day ) - 6 month ( 121 -270 day ) - ( 12 month ( 271 - 425 ) ) : patient insufficient sign heal 6 month visit ; otherwise preferable visit The following procedure perform visit : - Assessment fracture heal - Assessment physical function symptom ( QuickDASH* , WOMAC* , weight bear load affect extremity status ) - Screening AE serious AE include documentation report - Documentation reporting secondary surgical intervention due device procedure related Adverse event - Assessment health-related quality life ( EQ-5D* ) - Collection X-rays - Data entry eCRF . - Appointment next visit Clinical Investigation Administration : The clinical investigator ( ) permit registry-related monitoring , audit , ethic committee review regulatory inspection ( ) , thereby provide direct access facility , personnel source data/documents request . The Sponsor 's staff representative closely monitor conduct registry question problem may arise promptly resolve . Such monitoring also ensure registry conduct accordance registry protocol , include amendment requirement national regulation ISO 14155 . Monitoring involve periodic visit , Sponsor 's representative investigation site verify compliance requirement registry , observe procedure audit registry quality control purpose ( presence require document , informed consent comparison case report form source data ) . The frequency periodic visit depend enrolment rate whether difficulty run registry give site . A monitoring plan describe monitoring procedure detail . On-site audit may take place independent separate routine monitoring quality control function . They may take place various stage registry . The clinical investigator/s inform write and/or telephone timely manner independent audit take place along scope audit , date timeline involve . Whenever possible , auditor accompany responsible CRA Sponsor 's representative . The auditor may stay registry site long deem necessary . In order ensure quality data , relevant registry document ( registry protocol , case report form , patient information ) review person involve set-up management registry . The result audit document audit report corrective action need Investigator communicate Principal Investigator . In general , data collect hospital patient chart consider source data . In order facilitate data collection investigation site , set source worksheet ( SW ) base variable outline registry protocol provide . Data routinely document hospital chart collect worksheet therefore , worksheet consider source document keep investigation site accordingly . Data collect patient surgeon questionnaire also consider source data . Source data enter site staff web-based Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) system manage accord detailed pre-specified Data Management Plan . The Investigator site coordinator shall complete eCRF timely manner patient 's visit ie , later 10 day occurrence documentable event . Completed eCRFs verify source data ( ie , source data verification ) . Investigators shall provide access hospital file medical source document contain patient 's clinical/medical information , company representative allow source document verification . The clinical Investigator ask keep list full name patient participate registry , give reference patient record . After completion registry , electronic copy data collect investigation clinic provide . Radiographic image collect per standard imaging procedure ( standard care ) investigation site follow patient examination discharge , 6 12 week , 6 ( 12 ) month . Digital de-identified image send GCTM . Transfer image data GCTM handle de-identified imaging data GCTM perform accord GCTM standard procedure . More detail describe image manual . Images relevant registry retain de-identified electronically part TMF accordance relevant guideline . The central registry database monitor GCTM representative query make regular basis participate site need ensure quality integrity data . Data management perform GCTM . Data handling protection conduct accord guideline International Organization Standardization ( ISO ) 14155 applicable regulation . A study specific Data Management Plan describe detail data management quality control study database GCTM . All trial-related essential document ( i.e . document individually collectively permit evaluation conduct observational study quality data produce ) retain clinical Investigator least 15 year end registry per national requirement . In case possible , Sponsor organize archive facility source data , accordance data confidentiality regulation . The Sponsor inform clinical investigator ( ) write document longer need retain . The Sponsor retain specific essential document Trial Master File ( TMF ) accord relevant guideline . The Principal Investigator investigation site primary responsibility patient ' treatment , follow-up overall compliance registry protocol , national regulatory requirement requirement ISO 14155 . It advisable investigation site appoints study coordinator become primary point contact CRA concern overall registry administrative matter . All Investigators use DLS registry must train registry device , registry protocol requirement , national regulation requirement ISO 14155 prior become involved patient registry include curriculum vitae ( CV ) Investigator file copy Sponsor ' TMF . This training shall document CRA and/or Principal Investigator site personnel log along authorize task Principal Investigator delegate team member identification signature . The registry obligation Sponsor , Clinical Research Associate , Investigator follow outline ISO14155 applicable regulation , review Investigator prior start registry .</detailed_description>
