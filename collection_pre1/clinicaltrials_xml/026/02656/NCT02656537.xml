	<detailed_description>Catheter ablation non-paroxysmal AF complex trigger , present , immediately apparent , abnormal atrial substrate likely predominant mechanism . Additional catheter ablation strategy target atrial substrate modification introduce . The common strategy involve either application empirical linear lesion set atrial area ablation atrial area complex fractionate atrial electrograms addition pulmonary vein isolation . Nevertheless , correspond success rate long-term sinus rhythm maintenance modest . Non-paroxysmal AF leave AT characterize fast regular atrial activity , complex fractionate atrial electrograms , consistent direction wave front propagation , low peak-to-peak voltage . Advanced high-density three-dimensional catheter mapping strategy target evaluation characteristic mechanisms responsible AF leave AT , identification atrial area low peak-to-peak voltage determination `` critical '' atrial target catheter ablation procedure would essential . In clinical investigation , safety , feasibility performance novel EnSite™ HD Grid Catheter map system advance high-density three-dimensional mapping study patient undergoing catheter ablation procedure treatment non-paroxysmal AF leave AT .</detailed_description>
