	<brief_summary>This study test see metformin safe tolerate compare placebo adult Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ( ADPKD ) patient begin stage chronic kidney disease . We also measure effect progression kidney disease reflect kidney size kidney function , along effect kidney pain quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Novel Therapy Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There grow evidence metformin , drug widely use treatment type 2 diabetes polycystic ovary syndrome , may serve novel therapy individual early stage Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ADPKD activate metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) . AMPK activate condition metabolic cellular stress . Through action downstream mediator , AMPK activation low energy state decrease cellular energy consumption stimulate energy generate pathway . It show AMPK phosphorylates inhibits cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) , thus suppress epithelial fluid electrolyte secretion . Similarly , AMPK phosphorylates tuberin protein , lead indirect inhibition mTOR pathway . Thus , AMPK inhibit CFTR mTOR , suggest target activation kinase metformin may provide therapeutic benefit ADPKD . It show metformin treatment kidney epithelial cell lead stimulation AMPK subsequent inhibition mTOR CFTR activity . It also show metformin slow cystogenesis animal model PKD , support potential drug ADPKD treatment .</detailed_description>
