	<brief_summary>Reduced exercise tolerance commonly report patient bronchiectasis . The purpose study evaluate effect high-intensity inspiratory muscle training ( High-IMT ) sham High-IMT ( control ) exercise capacity , respiratory muscle function ( strength endurance ) health relate quality life patient bronchiectasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects High Intensity Inspiratory Muscle Training Exercise Capacity Patients With Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis often demonstrate decreased exercise tolerance , mark dyspnea fatigue . The cause multifactorial include altered pulmonary mechanic , inefficient gas exchange , decreased muscle mass , psychological status , lead progressive detrain effect . Essentially pathology functional manifestation bronchiectasis increase demand inspiratory muscle work contribute dyspnea exercise limitation . In recent study reduce strength respiratory muscle investigate bronchiectasis contribute exercise limitation . Additionally IMT show improve respiratory muscle function , exercise tolerance dyspnea patient bronchiectasis . Despite , number study inadequate optimal training protocol remain still define . In study researcher want investigate effect high-intensity inspiratory muscle train functional result patient bronchiectasis .</detailed_description>
