	<brief_summary>The essential eucalyptus oil therapeutic potential cardiovascular system , possibility act autonomic tonus reduction cardiovascular overload . Hemodynamic condition change physical requirement offer framework increase cardiovascular risk , especially elderly individual . In sense , preservation strategy cardiovascular autonomic control demand population condition rest and/or exercise require . The aim study investigate effect essential eucalyptus oil cardiovascular response recovery submaximal isometric resist exercise series elderly . Twenty elderly male ( 69.1 ± 5.7 year ; 75.3 ± 12.3 kg ; 168.0 ± 6.0 cm ) participate study . Were excluded sample volunteer present serious illness know accord criterion risk stratification American College Sports Medicine . In random order crusade , volunteer subject : 1 ) trial session essential eucalyptus oil inhalation ; 2 ) session control without inhalation essential eucalyptus oil . After session 1 2 , volunteer remain recovery period 60 minute , temperature-controlled environment comfortably seat . After period perform 3 set isometric resist exercise dominant upper limb intensity 30 % maximum voluntary contraction 1 min , 1 min recovery interval . Measures heart rate , blood pressure , rate product pressure heart rate variability hold rest 20 min , recovery 60 min 3 set isometric resist exercise . Indicators heart rate variability analyse time frequency domain . ANOVA two-way repeat measurement Post Hoc Tukey employ ( p &lt; 0.05 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The volunteer perform random order two experimental session separate 48 hour : 1 ) Control ; 2 ) Inhalation Essential Oil Eucalyptus . The experimental session always perform morning time day volunteer , avoid possible influence circadian rhythm . The experimental session hold Exercise Physiology Laboratory Federal University Vale São Francisco control temperature 25°C . At time pre session ( rest ) , recovery isometric resistance exercise ( post-session ) upper limb hand grip , blood pressure measurement take , heart rate record interval R-R absolute time frequency domain , calculate rate product pressure value ( systolic blood pressure x heart rate ) . Using disposable face mask participant inhale ten minute 0.25 ml essential oil eucalyptus measure adjustable Pipettor 100/1000μl . Inhalation substance occur immediately 20 minute rest period session Essential Oil Eucalyptus . In control session volunteer remain similar manner , instal face mask , however inhale fresh air . The test determine maximal voluntary contraction hold hand grip device Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer Saehan Model SH5001 range 0-90 kgf grip precision 2 kgf . Before test perform familiarization session two series 10 second minimum load allow equipment , series separate 2-minute recovery period . The value maximum voluntary load determine high value obtain three attempt 10 second , 2 minute trial position grip handle self select . The experimental isometric resistance exercise session undertake 48 hour interval maximum voluntary contraction test , equipment previously use test . The isometric resistance exercise series hold volunteer sit position comfortably shoulder adducted , elbow flex 90° forearm neutral position , position self select grip handle . The high value obtain kgf maximum voluntary contraction test use reference calculate absolute intensity exercise , correspond relative intensity 30 % test . Three set perform duration 1 minute recovery time session ( Eucalyptus Essential Oil Control ) .</detailed_description>
