	<detailed_description>The current study aim establish therapeutic potential tDCS freeze gait ( FOG ) motor-cognitive dysfunction Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . FOG phenomenon often unresponsive pharmacological treatment , especially advanced stage disease . While likely Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) provide symptomatic relief , also explore , via secondary outcome , potential tDCS modify disease progression . Support possibility stem likely mechanisms action tDCS . Based strong rationale preliminary finding previous work , objective current proposal conduct prospective multi-center , double-blinded , stratify control randomized clinical trial , compare real multifocal tDCS sham stimulation . The main aim : - To demonstrate `` short-term '' longer-term effect tDCS FOG severity frequency . Participants : A total 85 patient recruit ( Hoehn Yahr Stage 1-3.5 ) suffer FOG , measure new FOG questionnaire ( NFOG-Q ) demonstrate response FOG provoking protocol , stable medication , contraindication tDCS , age 40-80 . Patients DBS include . tDCS intervention : Subjects randomize receive either real sham tDCS intervention . Each intervention consist 10 , 20-minute treatment complete 2 consecutive week ( i.e. , 5 per week ) , follow previously establish protocol . A single , weekly `` maintenance '' treatment provide follow 12 week ( note : depression , maintenance tDCS often provide every two week ; take conservative approach first long-term study FOG PD ) . Participants continue take regular medication , treatment take place `` ON '' medication state ( approximately time day treatment ) . The real tDCS intervention simultaneously target M1 leg area dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , brain hemisphere contralateral affected side body , determined summation motor symptoms The unified Parkinson 's disease rating scale ( UPDRS ) . Current apply use array 8 sponge electrode StarStim tDCS device software ( Neuroelectrics , Inc ) . For protocol , placement current deliver electrode optimize use Neuroelectrics StimWeaver® Stimulation Optimization Service . In case bilateral symptom symmetry , tDCS target leave M1 DLPFC . For sham intervention , electrode placement stimulation parameter use ; however , current apply first 60 second stimulation session . This reliable control sensation arise tDCS diminish considerably first minute stimulation . At end treatment session , participant complete short questionnaire assess potential side-effects . At end entire intervention , participant ask state , opinion , receive real sham intervention . Outcome measure : The primary outcome number FOG episodes measure lab subject undergo validate FOG-invoking protocol , initial 2-week intervention final study point , similar propose Ziegler et al . Briefly , protocol include situation show provoke FOG . Patients ask sit , stand walk mark floor . They perform two 360° turn , clockwise counter-clockwise . Then , patient ask open door walk , turn outside , come back chair . Secondary outcome FOG include FOG duration new FOG questionnaire ( NFOG-Q ) . This FOG-provoking protocol take place ON OFF medication state high value ( bad ) FOG use primary outcome measure ( secondary analysis , examine ON OFF FOG separately ) . Additional secondary measure test influence tDCS motor , cognitive motor-cognitive function relate PD FOG . Secondary outcomes related motor function , likely affected change M1 excitability , include gait speed ( usual walking ) , Timed Up &amp; Go score , UPDRS motor score , level activity 7 day use portable , lightweight , water-proof sensor . Secondary measure executive function , hypothesize responsive tDCS DLPFC , include Trail Making test ( TMT ) part A B , previously validate computerized neuropsychological battery provide normalized score executive function attention ( memory ) . Dual-tasking gait speed ( i.e. , walk perform serial subtraction test ) ass motor-cognitive interaction . Functional near infra-red spectroscopy ( available Boston Tel Aviv ) ass frontal activation dual-tasking walking ; reflect subject ability handle cognitive loading associate FOG . Finally , PDQ-39 evaluate quality life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : patient diagnose PD , Hoehn Yahr Stage 13.5 , suffer FOG , measure screen previously validate new FOG questionnaire ( NFOGQ ) , whose medication change within 1 month study anticipate change study , able walk independently , age 4080 inclusive . Subjects show FOG test lab response FOG provoking protocol , diagnose psychiatric neurological disorder , stroke , unbalanced high blood pressure , pregnancy , participation clinical trial last three month , unwillingness randomize ; implant deep brain stimulation , pacemaker , intracranial electrode , implanted defibrillator prosthesis ; perceive inability complete study . Additional exclusion criterion relate tDCS safety include personal family history epilepsy , use neuroactive drug , risk metal fragment eye head .</criteria>
