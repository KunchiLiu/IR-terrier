	<brief_summary>Better patient education prior colonoscopy improves adherence instruction bowel preparation lead clean colon . The hypothesis trial computer assist instruction ( CAI ) use video 3D animation maximize effectiveness nurse counsel consequently improve bowel cleanliness . Furthermore , CAI positively influence patient experience . Adults refer colonoscopy include Dutch large volume endoscopy unit . Exclusion criterion illiteracy Dutch audiovisual handicap . Patients prospectively divide two group , one receiving nurse counsel one receive CAI nurse contact colonoscopy . The main outcome , cleanliness colon examination , measure Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale ( OBPS ) Boston Bowel Preparation Scale ( BBPS ) . Patient comfort anxiety assess multiple time point : directly instruction one hour colonoscopy . Comfort rescored 2 hour colonoscopy . We also test knowledge comprehension one hour colonoscopy . Statistical analysis include Mann-Whitney .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computer-assisted Instruction Before Colonoscopy Effective Nurse Counselling , Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To conduct study , prospective single center endoscopist blind controlled design use . Patients Consecutive patient older 18 year refer elective colonoscopy include March 2013 November 2013 single large volume endoscopy center ( 4000 colonoscopies/year ) great Amsterdam Area Netherlands . Exclusion criterion illiteracy Dutch audiovisual/mental handicap . Study design After informed consent obtain , patient divide two group : control group receive nurse counsel intervention group receive computer assist instruction ( CAI ) . Next , patient score comfort ( `` How comfortable ? '' ) patient anxiety ( `` How anxious ) '' 5-point Likert scale . ( T1 ) After , CAI group contact train endoscopy nurse practical matter like bridge anticoagulant therapy , insulin dosage calculation schedule colonoscopy . Next , patient schedule colonoscopy , maximum 6 week counsel session . One hour prior colonoscopy patient score comfort anxiety 5-point Likert scale . Also patient knowledge comprehension test 10-question survey provide counsel information ( T2 ) . Post-colonoscopy , patient re-scored comfort 5-point Likert scale ( T3 ) . During colonoscopy , endoscopist assess bowel cleanliness Boston Bowel Preparation Scale ( BBPS ) . For subtle difference Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale ( OBPS ) use . Computer assist instruction As intervention interactive CAI design , accord current best practice , like good accessibility , plain language engage user . Therefore information present stepwise . The CAI consist web-based platform use video mimic patient journey voice-over support photo 's , 3D animation instructive text . The video present short clip , maximal 45 second , maintain focus patient . Patient interaction ascertain mandatory mouse-click item CAI . All informative element , especially mandatory informed consent colonoscopy ( risk , alternative ) include . Outcomes The primary outcome cleanliness colon examination assess OBPS BBPS . The secondary outcome patient comfort , anxiety knowledge comprehension . Statistical analyse The sample size 350 provide 80 % power , two-tailed α 0.05 , detect increase primary outcome measure 6.0 control group 6.3 experimental group . All analysis perform use SPSS version 20.0 Windows ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Descriptive statistic use describe baseline information include frequency count , percentage mean ±standard deviation . Further analysis include chi-square test , independent t-test Mann-Whitney . P-values 0.05 regard statistically significant . Ethical consideration The study approve ethical executive board institute .</detailed_description>
