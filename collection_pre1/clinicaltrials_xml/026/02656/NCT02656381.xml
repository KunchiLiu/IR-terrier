	<brief_summary>Background : Uveitis serious eye disease cause vision loss . Treatment sometimes cause serious side effect work . Researchers want learn uveitis people develop . Objective : To learn clinical genetic factor may make people develop uveitis influence respond treatment . Eligibility : People age 8 old uveitis , scleritis , inflammatory eye disease , disease relate eye inflammation Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Eye exam Participation last 10 year . The clinic visit schedule varies depend participant eye disease : Baseline visit annual follow-ups Baseline visit , visit month 3 6 , annual follow-ups Another schedule set researcher Depending participant eye disease , test visit could include : Fluorescein angiography indocyanine green angiography : Dye inject needle arm flow blood vessel eye . A camera take picture eye . Electroretinography : Participants sit dark eye patch . After 30 minute , numb drop contact lenses put eye . Then , retina stimulate flashing light . Perimetry : Participants look bowl lens press button see light . Conjunctival corneal biopsy , skin biopsy : A small piece tissue remove . Anterior chamber tap : A needle enters eye remove fluid . Blood urine test Saliva , stool , hair , tear sample Cotton swab inside cheek . During study , participant may need immunosuppressive treatment , drug injection around eye depend disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Uveitis refers large group intraocular inflammatory disease cause devastate visual loss adult child . This study establish clinical database biospecimen repository identification novel factor relevant pathogenesis , progression , response treatment wide spectrum uveitic condition . Objectives : This study provide standardized collection longitudinal clinical data serial collection , processing , storage variety biospecimens . The clinical data set biospecimen repository use identify novel genetic factor , biomarkers , experimental model associate pathogenesis , progression , response treatment various ocular systemic condition inflammation uveal tract present . Study Population : The study plan accrue 500 participant uveitis related disease . This restricted anatomical location etiology inclusion idiopathic case , infectious uveitis , scleritis case link disease know associate increase risk intraocular inflammation ( e.g. , sarcoidosis , Beh ( SqrRoot ) ( Beta ) et 's disease multiple sclerosis ( MS ) lymphoma ) . Design : This prospective observational study participant intraocular inflammatory disease incorporate : 1 . A standardized follow-up test schedule standard-of-care management eye diseases ; 2 . Collection biospecimens research purpose sample incur minimal risk participant . Outcome Measures : Outcome measure include interaction key parameter disease phenotype ( visual acuity ocular imaging feature ) genetic variant biomarkers identify biospecimens characterization new experimental model eye health disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants eligible : 1 . Have diagnosis uveitis , scleritis disease know associated intraocular inflammation , ( e.g. , Beh ( SqrRoot ) ( Beta ) et disease , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) lymphoma ) . 2 . Are 8 year age old . 3 . For participant 18 year age older : Are willing give inform consent include collection study least one peripheral blood sample . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants eligible : 1 . Are unable understand sign inform consent form . 2 . Are unable unwilling give inform consent include use NIH medical record clinical sample current future research relate vision diseases affect eye . 3 . Have systemic disease compromise ability provide adequate ophthalmologic examination treatment determine investigator . 4 . Have inactive anterior uveitis quiescent infectious uveitis require regiment intensive standardized testing determine Investigator . 5 . Have end stage chronic quiescent change set establish infectious etiology , old ocular toxoplasma scar ( participant active intraocular inflammation due infection recruit ) .</criteria>
