	<brief_title>The Impact Lenses Musculoskeletal Visual Complaints VDU Workers With Neck Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use visual display unit ( VDU ) often accompanied physical complaint neck , shoulder , forearm hand , especially people make extensive use computer work . Besides , VDU operator also experience eye discomfort vision problem work computer long period . With increase computer use , VDU glass develop . They provide clear vision intermediate zone distance approximately 70 centimeter , closer distant vision distance 2 meter ( e.g . drive ) , near vision distance 40 centimeter ( e.g . reading ) , computer screen see clear without need excessive focus effort bad posture . Progressive lens lens power intermediate zone well , zone might large enough comfortable ergonomic computer work . VDU glass often progressive glass well , use read see thing beyond computer screen clear computer work . The research question study `` What impact wear progressive VDU lenses versus progressive lens , six month , musculoskeletal visual complaint VDU worker work relate neck complaint ? '' To find answer question , 40 VDU worker ( men woman ) work relate neck/shoulder complaint , recruit bank office perform predominantly VDU work . All participant receive information sign inform consent form . A questionnaire concern visual musculoskeletal complaint , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) Questionnaire complete begin experiment . Participants test old glass landscape office perform 20 minute VDU task . Before task , viscoelastic property ( MyotonPROÂ® ) trapezius muscle PPT ( WagnerTM FDX 50 hand-held pressure algometer ) trapezius muscle , levator scapulae muscle infraspinatus muscle measure . A 2D video analysis perform task.The Forward Head Angle ( FHA ) Forward Shoulder Angle ( FSA ) measure afterwards . After , participant ask fill short questionnaire , Visual Fatigue Questionnaire include , every two week two month . On 15th June , 2015 participant receive new glass ask wear six month computer work . During period short questionnaire fill every two week . The test procedure repeat new glass six month wear . A short version first questionnaire complete end experiment .</detailed_description>
