	<brief_summary>The main purpose project investigate blood flow ophthalmic artery ( OA ) patient ocular hypertension , high tension glaucoma normal tension glaucoma . It also study influence intraocular pressure difference OA blood flow two first group . Furthermore , investigator want understand relationship ocular dynamic , blood flow structural alternation optic nerve head ( ONH ) . The rationale behind study improve knowledge pathogenesis glaucoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator investigate OA blood flow , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) structural property optic nerve . The investigator include glaucoma patient believe glaucoma may cause influenced OA blood flow . The investigator include also patient intraocular hypertension without pseudoexfoliation order study change IOP interact OA blood flow structural property optic nerve group develop glaucoma . In addition , investigator investigate patient develop glaucoma spite normal IOP . Therefore , investigator study three fundamentally different group ( G1 , G2 G3 ) patient well control group healthy subject ( G4 ) : G1 : Newly diagnose untreated Glaucoma ( optic visual field damage exists ) . G2 : Ocular hypertension IOP â‰¥ 23 mmHg ( i.e . elevate eye pressure ) . G3 : Normal Tension Glaucoma . G4 : Healthy subject . Each group include 25 patient apart G2 50 patient include , half pseudoexfoliation syndrome . The study perform accordance tenet Helsinki Declaration approve regional ethical board . Study protocol overview : Study protocol consist two part examination repeat approximately one week : Each part divide two examination ; one Department radiology follow one Department ophthalmology . The measurement repeat approximately one week later G1 G2 . Day 1 : First , MRI scan brain measure blood flow OA well structural morphological property ON ( see method ) . Second , MRI examination , patient examine Department ophthalmology . Measurement intraocular pressure , ocular pulse amplitude , central corneal thickness , bulb length , investigation optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) blood pressure perform . The patient G3 ( Normal Pressure Glaucoma ) participate Day 1 , since case already pressure-lowering treatment . Also subject G4 vill participate Day 1 . All participant receive pressure lower drug ( Latanoprost ) one eye daily , protocol repeat Day 2 . Day 2 : The measurement Day 1 repeat approximately one week later . The measurement make eye , eye serve control . That way investigator good opportunity assess much change investigator see treat eye may due normal variation OA blood flow much depend give treatment . The finding compare group normal material G4 . The investigator able see whether , , extent , eye glaucoma differ normal eye term blood flow OA compare IOP measurement , different biomechanical parameter eye . Thus , determine pressure dynamic calculate ocular compliance three different group research subject ; newly diagnose glaucoma , ocular hypertension , normal tension glaucoma .</detailed_description>
