	<brief_title>Evaluation Stability Two Uncemented Hip Implants Used Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Material Methods Hypothesis The uncemented Echo® Bi-Metric® Full proximal Profile THA stem show less migration less bone loss periprosthetic bone compare uncemented Bi-Metric® Porous Primary THA stem . Operation All operation perform 4 experienced hip surgeon Hip unit Department Orthopedic Surgery , Gentofte Hospital , Gentofte , Denmark . Each surgeon perform approximately 120 THA-operations year . Surgery perform accord standard procedure postero-lateral approach follow manufacturer ` recommendation . During surgery minimum 4 Tantalum marker ( 0.8-1.0 mm ) insert bone proximal femur define bone segment RSA analysis . All patient receive uncemented hemispheric acetabular cup ( Exceed ) highly cross-linked polyethylene liner . No local analgesic inject . Physiotherapy begin day surgery patient mobilize full weight-bearing use crutch . All patient get oral anticoagulant accord praxis department ( Xarelto discharge ) , prophylactic antibiotic ( Dicloxacillin , 2 g preoperatively 1g x 2 postoperatively ) first 24 hour . Research plan 1 . Clinical examination perform preoperatively follow-up 1 2 year evaluation hip function use Harris Hip Score ( HHS ) ; HHS questionnaire patient reveal level pain , function , mobility range motion . 2 . Conventional X-rays : To evaluate possible aseptic loosening , patient standardize full pelvic antero-posterior X-ray lateral X-ray fix magnification preoperatively , postoperatively , 2 year follow-up visit 5 year follow-up visit . Radiolucent line bone-implant interface evidence osteolysis measure recording . The standard Gruen zone use record radiolucency surround femoral component acetabular zone describe DeLee Charnley use record radiolucency surround acetabular component . The apparent thickness radiolucency within zone record . Evidence osteolysis ( radiolucency &gt; 2mm thickness ) periprosthetic tissue acetabular femoral component consider failure . 3 . DXA analysis change BMD periprosthetic Gruen zone use evaluate adaptive bone remodel implantation two different stem . DXA analysis perform preoperatively hip proximal tibia baseline , within first postoperative week subsequently 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 2 year 5 year . The precision BMD measurement proximal femur estimate double measurement patient ( n=12 ) include study . 4 . MB-RSA measurement migration femoral component . A MB-RSA system use ; technique position prosthesis assess match virtual projection 3D-model prosthesis actual radiographic projection . It require former time ' special implant attached marker . The patient x-rayed within first postoperative week subsequently 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 2 year 5 year use 2 fixed X-ray tube patient supine position uniplanar calibration cage use . The precision measurement migration estimate set double X-rays patient ( n=12 ) include study . 5 . Patient report outcome measurement . It plan also ask patient preoperatively 6 , 12 24 month patient-reported outcome measurement use Oxford Hip Score ( OHS ) . 6 . Long term follow-up . 5-year follow-up include mentioned parameter perform . Calculations sample size Migration ( RSA ) . Several publish RSA study available none evaluate uncemented Bi-Metric stem include data clinically relevant migration 1 2 year . Quite lot RSA study evaluate migration cement uncemented femoral stem publish , investigator give variability RSA result total range standard error mean . We decide sample size calculation use average standard deviation ( SD ) -for migration 2 year follow-up two previously publish study ( include data one uncemented ( n=22 ) two cement stem ( n=82 ) , clear information regard SD available publication . We perform calculation use parameter MTPM two year postoperatively use : Type I error = 5 % Type II error = 15 % MIREDIF = 0.6 mm SD = 0.69 mm Calculation result sample size n = 23 group . Bone remodeling ( DXA ) . The expected prospective decrease BMD proximal femur insertion uncemented THA pronounce Gruen zone 1 7 decrease respectively 13-21 % 10-31 % . In study intend measure significant difference ( MIREDIF ) percentage change BMD two group 7.5 % . Even though several study evaluate prospective change BMD around femoral stem publish , find study precise information SD percentages BMD . Thus , estimate SD change BMD 8 % could use calculate sample size study . Using : Type I error = 5 % Type II error = 15 % MIREDIF = 7.5 % SD = 8 % Calculation result sample size n = 20 group . Based upon sample size calculation RSA DXA plan include randomize total : 60 patient . This secure high statistical power study ( even participants drop study ) keep even study continue beyond 2 year follow-up . Randomization Allocation Echo® Bi-Metric® group control group ( Bi-Metric® group ) perform random basis ( block randomization 10 block ) . Randomization do day surgery close non-transparent envelope open operation theatre patient ready surgery . Due visual difference two prosthesis , surgeon personnel present know prostheses patient shall receive . Ethical consideration This investigation perform accordance principle Helsinki Declaration , patient receive oral write information inform consent participate obtain . It investigators job inform patient completely understand aspect participation . At time patient able cancel participation ( also without explanation ) investigation . The patient receive best possible treatment circumstance . The study start approval Scientific Ethical Committee Capital Region Denmark Danish Data Protection Agency obtain , register clinicaltrials.gov . We expect patient participate study experience specific side effect complication relate directly use two orthopedic implant . A potential difference two prosthesis expect measurable use precise technique DXA RSA . Radiation dose patient RSA DXA low compare conventional x-ray examination . The total accumulated radiation dose patient participate examination study estimate approximately 0.1 mSv . Tantalum use 50 year biocompatible material . Tantalum bead RSA use especially Sweden several clinical study 20 year . More 20.000 bead implant 2.000 patient side effect Tantalum bead observe . Risks inconvenience There always risk associated operation . This investigation add general risk get THA . Patients participate must accept inconvenience term additional examination hence transportation hospital . Adverse event Adverse event define harmful unwanted event , sign symptom occur relation trial . All adverse event record CRF include detail concern nature , onset , duration , severity , relationship device relationship operative procedure outcome . The affected patient ( ) question adverse event ( ) subsequent follow-up visit . Patients experience adverse event relevantly monitor clinical assessment lab examination decide treat physician . All adverse event monitor recovery stabilization . Information consent Patients plan receive THA ( fit within inclusion exclusion criterion study ) Gentofte Hospital inform trial preoperative interview . In addition oral information provide , patient give write information . This conversation take place enclosed space without distraction interruption . The patient receive adequate verbal write information purpose , process , potential benefit risk include possible side effect . Investigator ensure patient read understood information consent form . Patients inform entitled consideration consent give . The subject also inform voluntary time may withdraw trial . It investigator 's responsibility ensure . There obtain write informed consent subject enrollment , copy information consent form give subject . Existing legislation make Scientific Ethical Committee regard informed consent follow . Data protection All information keep confidential , data handle accord guideline Danish Data Protection agency . The person involve trial oblige professional secrecy . The investigator maintain list identification enrol patient . This list contain patient ' full name date birth ( include social security number ( CPR-numbers ) ) . Collected data record case report form ( CRF ) . CRFs medical record make available third party accord Danish law .
