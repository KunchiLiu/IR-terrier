	<brief_title>Home Tonometry With I-care Tonometer Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monitoring glaucoma require frequent evaluation IOP disease severity , typically visual field test . When patient diagnose glaucoma optimum level IOP ( target IOP ) determine base patient 's characteristic , severity disease life expectancy . In current model care patient IOP measure clinic different interval . If IOP note high , patient 's target , additional treatment recommend . Accurate frequent IOP measurement different point time thus imperative . Tonometry usually conduct clinician eye clinic . Some tonometer ( e.g. , Icare ) potential use individual home monitoring IOP patient suspect glaucoma/glaucoma . Self-monitoring IOP via home tonometry allow patient undergo IOP measurement different point time ( e.g. , early morning night-time , help determine diurnal change spike ) . The overall objective current study conduct feasibility pilot study home tonometer ( Icare ) , acquire initial experience Icare tonometer . For purpose investigator train 20 individual use device . Investigators ask record diary IOP twice day period 2 week . Investigators compare IOP outcome measurement take clinic . Patients clinician mask IOP data .</detailed_description>

Not receive IOP monitoring ( glaucoma ocular hypertension ) 2 . Aged &lt; 18 year 3 . Patients deem unable monitor IOP home ( someone help ) e.g. , apparent physical cognitive impairment allow use home tonometer 4 . Had surgery glaucoma ( glaucoma surgery onlyÍ¾ surgery include e.g. , cataract surgery ) 5 . Patient preexist corneal disease</criteria>
