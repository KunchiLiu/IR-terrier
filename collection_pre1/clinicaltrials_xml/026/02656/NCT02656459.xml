	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine immune response traumatic injury subsequent infection critically ill adult . Traumatic injury lead severe dysregulation immune system , predispose severe infection . Diagnosing infection timely manner paramount reduce morbidity mortality , diagnosis make difficult inflammatory response trauma . The main purpose study prospectively test diagnostic power expression 11-gene set investigator recently publish ( Sweeney et al. , Sci Transl Med , 2015 ) . Since timing acquire infection determine priori , study design longitudinal examination cohort traumatically injured adult . The investigator draw blood regular interval , well day diagnosis infection patient diagnose infection . The investigator assay blood gene expression level post hoc , correlate molecular profile clinical information establish prospective estimate diagnostic power .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consecutive patient meet criterion ( see ) enrol . Whole blood drawn store PAXgene tube . Blood drawn within 24 hour ICU admission ( ICU day 1 ) , every three day subsequently ( ICU day 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 ) two week . In addition , tube blood drawn time clinical diagnosis infection , infection diagnose ( see ) . Patients discharge ICU prior two week longer profile . The hour date admission , hour date subsequent blood draw , record . Rates hospital-acquired infection severe traumatic injury run around 30-50 % . The investigator enroll 50 patient , net around 20 patient infection , 30 time-matched non-infected control . In total , average 4 samples/patient , 200 total blood sample , expect . Diagnosis Infection : The main purpose study examine gene expression response infection . As result , careful attention must pay infection classify . First , two systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome ( SIRS ) criteria NOT necessary designate infected . Second , time diagnosis infection ( time extra blood sample ) time clinical diagnosis , late time culture turn positive . It thus base clinical judgement . Finally , post-hoc criterion infection describe elsewhere . Patients need eventually meet criterion count infect ; do analysis phase , clinical phase .</detailed_description>
