	<brief_title>Uterine Transplantation Pregnancy Induction Women Affected Absolute Uterine Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Absolute Uterine Factor Infertility ( AUI ) due congenital surgical absence uterus presence nonfunctional uterus . Until 2014 option woman affect Absolute Uterine Factor Infertility ( AUI ) adoption surrogate motherhood . Primary Objective - Successful living decease donor uterine transplant result live birth . - Pregnancy rate via vitro fertilization . BACKGROUND In 1991 National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry ( NTPR ) establish study outcome female transplant recipient . In 2010 NTPR collect data 2000 pregnancy outcome . The NTRP database include data pregnancy follow-up parent offspring . The first report case pregnancy transplant report 1958 . In 2011 25,787 solid organ transplant recipient ( kidney , liver , pancreas , small bowel , heart &amp; lung ) : - 9662 woman - 3505 childbearing age - 765 less 17 year old could potentially become pregnant late life . One benefit receive kidney , liver , pancreas , small bowel , heart lung transplant underlie disease cause subject transplant go , therefore fertility return . Pregnancy transplant increasingly common . This led accumulation data knowledge best manage subject population . These pregnancy still consider high-risk . Successful pregnancy outcome result transplant obstetrics team work closely together . The American Society Transplantation ( AST ) recommend solid organ pregnancy allowable : rejection within past year , adequate stable graft function , acute infection may impact fetal growth well-being maintenance immunosuppression stable dosing . Both NTPR AST advise wait one year transplant conceiving . This one year wait time associate well maternal neonatal outcome few obstetric complications.Based long term data NPTR transplant recipient 's pregnancy outcomes relative safety immunosuppressive medication new area transplant develop . Uterine transplant may provide additional option woman absolute uterine infertility ( AUI ) . Pre-clinical research uterine transplant go decade . There several study demonstrate feasibility Uterine Transplantation animal , primates non-primates . In last year human trial start Europe . RATIONALE In Great Britain estimate 12000 woman childbearing age affect AUI . In US number woman affect AUI may million consider 9 million woman reproductive age hysterectomy . Congenital absence Uterus report 1/5000 woman 2005 12000 woman reproductive age,15 year 44 year diagnose congenital absence Uterus . In US , 1000 hysterectomy perform immediately post-partum every 1 million birth . It estimate 62 million woman United States reproductive age 15.4 % may absolute AUI , 7 million woman may lose uterus benign cause obstetric complication . Although statistic may offer different interpretation seem evident thousand woman United States may interest consider Uterine Transplantation best option child . Previous Subject Experience There two report attempt uterine transplantation institution , one able carry two pregnancy term . However , University Gothenburg report first clinical trial Uterine Transplantation nouvelle treatment AUI . In report 9 living donor 9 recipient underwent donor hysterectomy recipient uterine transplantation . Seven 9 viable uteri time report 1 recipient losing transplant uterus infection one vascular complication . One donor suffer surgical grade IIIb complication , ureterovaginal fistula , successfully treat . This early report follow subsequent one 7 recipient show regular menses 5 seven recipient suffer mild rejection episode successfully treat . The feasibility Uterine Transplantation cure AUI finally demonstrate first live birth uterus transplantation . The surgery describe Gothenburg University Group consist total abdominal hysterectomy upper vaginectomy preservation major feed artery vein uterus donor implantation uterus pelvis recipient . Vascular anastomosis achieve two major artery vein uterus , extend external iliac vessel recipient use transplant microvascular technique . Finally vaginal rim transplant uterus anastomosed recipient 's vaginal vault . The procedure perform also uterus obtain deceased donor . The hysterectomy decease donor proceed describe . The advantage obtain vascular pedicle attach segment iliac artery vein make implantation recipient technically easier . The preservation solution change ischemia time keep 6 hour . 2 . STUDY DESIGN This prospective study treat absolute uterine infertility ( AUI ) uterine transplantation result live birth . There five distinct clinical stage study inclusion/exclusion meet criterion &amp; subject consent : Pre-transplant/Screening , Transplant/Recovery , embryo transfer/Pregnancy , Delivery/Explant , Follow . Number Clinical Sites Subjects This trial conduct Annette C. Harold C. Simmons Transplant Institute , Baylor University Medical Center Dallas , TX . A total 10 female ( biologically ) subject receive uterine transplant . Subjects either receive uterus live donor cadaveric donor . Living donor consent per living donor research protocol . Uterus recovery cadaveric donor follow UNOS guideline . SUBJECT PARTICIPATION STUDY DURATION All subject follow 5 year period post-transplant . Continued follow depend upon subject status : - Subjects receive uterine transplant result live birth uterus remove follow 12 month post explant . - Subjects receive uterine transplant result live birth desire another pregnancy follow second pregnancy result live birth 12 month post explant . - Subjects uterus explanted due infection , rejection unable maintain pregnancy follow 12 month post explant .</detailed_description>
