	<brief_summary>Objectives : To evaluate effect novel adapt Taekwondo ( TKD ) training programme skeletal development motor proficiency pre-pubertal child developmental coordination disorder ( DCD ) . Hypothesis : The TKD group participant improve skeletal development motor proficiency outcomes adapt TKD training compare control . Design subject : In prospective , randomised , single-blinded control trial , approximately 104 child DCD ( 6-9 year old ) randomly assign either adapted TKD group ( n~52 ) control group ( n~52 ) . Interventions : Subjects intervention group receive adapt TKD train 3 month ( one supervise session/week plus daily home training , 1 hour per session ) , subject control group receive TKD training study period . Study instrument outcome : Primary outcome measure : delay skeletal development motor proficiency measure ultrasonic bone age system Movement Assessment Battery Children , respectively . Secondary outcome measure : eye-hand coordination stand balance measure computerised finger point test Sensory Organisation Test , respectively ( pre- , post- follow-up measurement ) . Data analysis : Data analyse via repeated-measure analysis ( co ) variance follow post-hoc test , appropriate ( alpha = 0.05 ) .</brief_summary>
