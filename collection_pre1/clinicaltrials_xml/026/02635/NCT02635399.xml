	<brief_summary>Surgical resection periampullary cancer use pancreaticoduodenectomy important modality treatment . In past , pancreaticoduodenectomy associate high morbidity mortality . However , advance technique , include perioperative patient management , development antibiotic , diagnostic radiology , interventional treatment , pancreaticoduodenectomy consider safe feasible operation . Postoperative complication rate report 10 20 % experienced hospital operation relate mortality 1 % . Therefore , surgical treatment periampullary cancer actively consider . However , postoperative complication , postoperative pancreatic fistula , ( POPF ) delay gastric emptying , intraabdominal abscess , postoperative bleeding , still serious complication . Among complication , delay gastric empty consider less critical . However , delay gastric emptying ( DGE ) cause poor oral intake , turn , may lead delay recovery postoperative nutritional state severe case , require insertion levine tube long-term fasting . There many hypothesis cause DGE pancreaticoduodenectomy , definite cause discover yet . With introduction pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PPPD ) , incidence DGE initially report increased . However , result randomize comparative study conclude PPPD PD significance occurence DGE . One hypothesis cause DGE present anatomic positioning anastomosis site , especially pancreatojejunostomy ( PJ ) duodenojejunostomy ( DJ ) , PPPD . Reconstruction PPPD position PJ DJ close . PJ site often associate one postoperative complication , POPF . POPF may create inflammation around PJ site pancreatitis , may lead severe adhesion around PJ secondary change . This adhesion inflammation may cause DJ , locate near PJ , pull towards PJ site . When DJ pull towards PJ site , distal DJ site become angulate gastric content may beadle pas easily . Gastric content may stagnate stomach thereby cause DGE . Therefore , study , fixate DJ transverse colon use suture , prevent possibility angulation DJ . This additional procedure may reduce occurence DGE .</brief_summary>
