	<brief_summary>Upper endoscopy ( Esophagogastroduodenoscopies-EGDs ) well low endoscopy ( Colonoscopies ) routinely perform gastroenterologist ass line patient ' upper low gastrointestinal tract use video endoscope ( long tube video camera end ) . An EGD perform examine upper digestive tract look area inflammation , ulceration , abnormality swallow tube , stomach , duodenal lining . Similarly , colonoscopy perform directly visualize large bowel polyp , inflammation , abnormality lower bowel lining . During procedure , room air routinely use insufflate ( expand/inflate stomach colon ) allow good view line upper low gastrointestinal tract ; however , recently use carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) ( instead air ) show possibly less post-procedure patient discomfort . Additionally , procedure perform day , currently unknown sequence procedure well overall -whether perform EGD colonoscopy vice versa . The overall aim research compare patient ' comfort , total amount sedation use , overall satisfaction procedure four randomly allocate group , see method insufflation procedural sequence well procedure need perform day . We hypothesize patient require day endoscopy , perform EGD prior Colonoscopy carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) use insufflator best tolerate sequence associate decreased sedation use increase patient satisfaction/comfort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Same Day Bidirectional Endoscopies - Does Sequence Procedures Choice Insufflator Matter ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Same day bi-directional endoscopy ( EGD-esophagogastro-duodenoscopies colonoscopy ) routinely perform endoscopy unit . Little however know order sequence two procedure ( i.e . EGD ( upper endoscopy ) colonoscopy ( low endoscopy ) vice-versa ) consequence . Those favor perform EGDs prior colonoscopy ( EGD first approach ) argue sedation necessary EGD carry colonoscopy thus allow well tolerate colonoscopy . Additionally , abdominal bloating cause insufflation air colonoscopy could lead reduce tolerance subsequent EGD . Others however , argue gaseous distention small intestine cause perform EGD first lead difficult uncomfortable colonoscopy thereafter , likely due mechanical effect air migrate proximal colon . Studies compare procedural sequence day endoscopy reveal conflict result date . Some study show use EGD first approach allow well procedural quality , decrease overall patient discomfort , less sedation , much high chance determine diagnosis undifferentiated patient ( e.g . occult GI bleeding ) . Other study either show difference overall patient discomfort satisfaction procedure , even preference colonoscopy EGD . While study use moderate sedation , others use sedation make generalization result difficult . The use carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) insufflation upper low endoscopy recently become popular traditionally used room air , especially study reveal less post-procedure patient discomfort use CO2 . Whether use affect prefer sequence procedure still unknown . Institutional variation across Canada regard sequence procedure day bidirectional endoscopy currently base combination personal preference study available . Given absence formal guideline area , undertake current study test hypothesis : In patient require day bi-directional endoscopy , perform EGD prior Colonoscopy carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) use insufflator best tolerate sequence associate decreased sedation use increase patient satisfaction/comfort .</detailed_description>
