	<brief_summary>Intraileal infusion nutrient result reduction food intake . A previous study group show sucrose casein infusion result increase satiety release gastrointestinal peptide decrease hunger food intake . Encapsulating nutrient , daily ingestion micro encapsulate hereby release distal small intestine could result chronic ileal brake activation . The obtained reduction food intake caloric intake could help overweight subject lose weight .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proof Concept Study ; The Effect Encapsulated Nutrient Mixture Ileal Brake Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity weight management Worldwide incidence overweight obesity rapidly increase negative impact health health care cost . The efficacy currently available treatment relatively limited long term . So far , surgical intervention proven strategy overcome severe obesity long-term . Furthermore , recent meta-analysis conclude dietary supplement exercise alone contribute improve weight loss caloric restriction diet . Therefore , important develop new effective strategy induce weight loss help weight maintenance weight loss . A promising mechanism weight management activate call 'ileal brake ' . Ileal brake The ileal brake refers intestinal feedback mechanism trigger nutrient specific location small intestine , result modulation gastrointestinal secretion motility also food intake hunger . The ileal brake activate ileal infusion undigested lipid recently find ileal infusion sucrose casein suppresses food intake extend equicaloric amount lipids8 . In addition reduction food intake , increase feeling satiety decrease hunger find . Since ileal brake activation seem promise target weight management strategy alternative nutrient delivery technique use . Several study investigate effect nutrient infusion region small intestine . However study use intestinal feeding catheter order infuse nutrient directly desire part small intestine . In order investigate effect long-term ileal brake activation overweight individual , different approach nutrient delivery need choose . An alternative distal small intestinal nutrient delivery via feed catheter encapsulation nutrient . Encapsulation use deliver nutrient specific intestinal location . By encapsulation , nutrient covered/surrounded edible coating . This coating define thin layer edible material apply surface nutrient . This provide barrier digestion stomach proximal part small intestine . Comparable approach already use site-specific drug delivery . Two example system able deliver drug ileo-colonic region ColoPulse system describe Schellekens et al . ( 2010 ) ileo-colonic delivery system describe Varum et al . ( 2013 ) . Both method invent accelerate drug release ileo-colonic region use specific EudragitÂ® polymer coating . Adjusting polymer coating result proximal ( ileum ) delivery . However technique develop drug delivery . To activate ileal brake prefer use completely food grade application . Another food grade approach deliver nutrient distal small intestine micro-encapsulation . This micro-encapsulation technique use present study deliver mixture nutrient consist mostly sucrose ( 60 % ) , casein ( 30 % ) shell whey protein ( 10 % ) distal small intestine . The delivery method patent AnaBio Technologies Ltd. ( http : //www.AnaBio.ie/ ) comprise active component , encapsulate within protein matrix preferably whey protein . The mechanism technique delivers active preferred intestinal location base pH , surface porosity microspheres , reaction specific enzyme . These three parameter use design micro-encapsulation bead deliver active ingredient prefer intestinal location ( e.g . duodenum , jejunum ileum ) . Furthermore size micro-beads important intestinal transit time . AnaBio use data collect human animal study relate size micro-beads intestinal transit time , dose volume physiological characteristic . The micro-bead size ( micron range ) chosen base population group require transit time , average use size 150 micron . The advantage small particle particle mixed food product . The ratio active : encapsulate protein matrix 95 : 5 % . This mean sucrose encapsulate 95 % micro-bead pure sucrose 5 % whey protein . We know previous research8 infusion 13 gram sucrose able activate ileal brake . For present study use mixture encapsulate sucrose microbeats ( 60 % ) encapsulate casein microbeats ( 30 % ) order simulate composition small mixed carbohydrate protein rich meal . Efficacy small intestinal delivery AnaBio provide data ( share due IP application ) four vivo study 3 human study 1 pig study . In study efficacy delivery method investigate . It conclude study whey protein micro-encapsulation technique specific intestinal delivery method specific either ileum ( 2 human study 1 pig study ) jejunum ( 1 human study ) . Present study In present study effect 6 week ileal brake activation body weight , BMI waist circumference investigate . It hypothesize 6 week ileal brake activation delivery encapsulate nutrient mixture distal small intestine result reduce body weight . This studied daily ingestion encapsulate nutrient mixture ( e.g . 60 % sucrose 30 % casein encapsulate 10 % whey protein ) either delivered distal small intestine ( active ) stomach ( placebo ) lunch dinner 6 week randomize , double blind parallel placebo control trial . This studied second phase study ( phase 2 ) . Pre intervention , study day 1 2 ( SD1 SD2 ) , middle ( SD4 ) post ( SD5 ) intervention period efficacy decrease food intake ( &gt; 68 kcal ) evaluate . It unknown whether ileal brake activate encapsulated nutrient mixture deliver distal small intestine ( active ) magnitude ileal brake activation ileal sucrose casein infusion . Therefore , study ileal brake activation efficacy encapsulate nutrient mixture ingestion ad libitum food intake . This do first phase study ( phase 1 ) . Pre-intervention efficacy test randomized placebo control cross design . Within every subject difference ad libitum food intake active placebo ingestion study . If active encapsulate nutrient mixture result reduction food intake intervention start .</detailed_description>
