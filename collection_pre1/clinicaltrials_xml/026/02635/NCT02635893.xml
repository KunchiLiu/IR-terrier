	<detailed_description>This study plan examine plasticity corticospinal synapses lower-limb muscle . demonstrate plasticity elicit corticospinal synapsis spinal cord result enhancement electromyographic ( EMG ) force activity upper-limb muscle . The first step proposal determine synaptic plasticity elicit corticospinal projection target lower-limb muscle human SC . We also study method strengthen corticospinal plasticity promote recovery leg clearance training . We use two novel strategy enhance plasticity corticospinal synapsis lower-limb muscle SCI : ) . administration N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor agonist ( i.e . D-cycloserine ) , b ) . Combine NMDA-induced corticospinal plasticity training ( 2D low limb training locomotor training . Corticospinal synaptic plasticity think depend activation NMDA receptor D-cycloserine enhances motor skill behavior animal human enhance NMDA-induced corticospinal plasticity . An important strength aim combination training strategy aim enhance synaptic efficacy residual corticospinal projection . Training effect physiological pathway explore correlated locomotor function</detailed_description>
