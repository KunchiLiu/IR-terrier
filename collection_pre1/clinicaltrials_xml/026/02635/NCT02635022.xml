	<detailed_description>Background : The Asia Fracture Gap Taiwan Study ( AFGTS ) show among fragility fracture sufferer , 1/4 underwent bone mineral density ( BMD ) test 1/3 received treatment osteoporosis . Secondary fragility fracture prevention service need improve care gap . In addition , one-year adherence oral anti-osteoporosis medication ( AOMs ) 30 % . In recent year , effort make change delivery medication oral form injection form every , 3 , 6 12 month increase adherence . However , patient provider sometimes confused multiple choice .

Aims : ( 1 ) Establish FLS service National Taiwan University Hospital Jinshan Branch . ( 2 ) To establish anti-osteoporosis medication management service Jinshan Branch . Method : The FMS design follow 13 'Capture Fracture Best Practice Standards ' . The National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) institutional review board approve study Aug. , 2015 . Patients eligible enrolled FMS part study - Age &gt; =50 one - New hip fracture orthopedic ward - Newly identify radiographic vertebral fracture plan film geriatric ward clinical vertebral fracture outpatient clinic - Newly prescribe AOMs - Recent change AOMs - Poor adherence AOMs - Participating physician feel service benefit patient overall osteoporosis medication management . Exclusion Criteria : - Life expectancy le 2 year ca n't assess communication problem - Atypical fracture - Patient medication clinical trial - Unwilling accept assessment treatment Osteoporosis-related assessment , treatment , consultation diet , medication , exercise , fall prevention give mainly care manager . A system set remind patient take medication home return clinic regular injection medication . Follow assessment include adherence education instruction , medication , fall fracture incidence . During whole study period , plan enroll 200 patient . Each patient would assess baseline , every 4 month last two year .
