	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate novel stimulation protocol repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) treatment unifocal neocortical epilepsy , namely continuous thetaburst stimulation ( cTBS ) . As pilot study , primary endpoint safety tolerability treatment . However , information clinical efficacy mechanism action also collect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Thetaburst Stimulation Treatment Refractory Epilepsy - Safety , Feasibility Proof-of-concept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Study design : This open label prospective pilot trial continuous thetaburst stimulation ( cTBS ) patient unifocal neocortical epilepsy . The study comprise 13-week period , consist 4 week baseline seizure frequency assessment , one-week treatment period baseline assessment Monday ( T0 ) stimulation session Tuesday Friday ( T1-T4 ) , 8-week follow-up period short-term assessment immediately final stimulation session Friday afternoon ( T4 ) long-term assessment 2 week ( FU2 ) 8 week ( FU8 ) . 2 . Objectives : The primary objective ass feasibility , safety tolerability cTBS refractory epilepsy patient . The secondary objective assess clinical efficacy associate mechanism action cTBS unifocal neocortical epilepsy . 3 . Rationale : An open label prospective design allows make first estimate safety , feasibility tolerability cTBS refractory epilepsy patient . There currently report available cTBS perform epilepsy patient . The ultimate aim assess clinical efficacy cTBS regard seizure frequency , feasibility safety study prerequisite order achieve goal .</detailed_description>
