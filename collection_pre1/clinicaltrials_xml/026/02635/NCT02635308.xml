	<brief_summary>This study evaluate feasibility implement unilaterally bias high-intensity resistance training facilitate restorative vs. compensatory recovery `` usual care '' physical therapy among old adult recently incur hip fracture . Additionally , physical performance sit-to-stand task , muscle function ( strength/power ) , physical function measure , muscle composition , muscle quality ( force/unit area ) , assess target high-intensity resistance training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Rehabilitation After Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture major public health concern United States . Fall-related injury constitute lead cause deaths disability among person age 65 year . Hip fracture consistently identify one frequent , costly , devastating non-lethal injury fall . Rehabilitation hip fracture remain largely unchanged last 30 year despite evidence high-intensity rehabilitation benefit physical function hip fracture beyond recovery typical `` usual care '' . Asymmetries demonstrate physical performance various task , gait , balance , sit-to-stand transfer , impaired surgical limb muscle function evident year hip fracture , may contribute high rate fall decline function typically encounter old adult recover hip fracture . Implementing high-intensity rehabilitation approach target asymmetry hip fracture likely yield improve symmetry physical function muscle function . This study recruit old adult recently incur hip fracture complete `` usual care '' physical therapy determine whether high-intensity rehabilitation strategy target asymmetry movement strategy muscle function surgical limb successfully implement challenge population . In particular , recruitment , adherence rehab protocol parameter , retention address among initiate high-resistance training approximately 8-12wk hip fracture incidence . In addition , investigator explore potential target unilaterally-biased resistance training improve surgical limb function performance hip fracture . Specifically , physical performance , muscle function , muscle quality/composition record compare pre-/post-training determine whether improvement occur conjunction high-intensity rehabilitation training . Additionally , investigator measure improvement muscle composition occur result high-intensity resistance training .</detailed_description>
