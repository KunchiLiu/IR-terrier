Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . The hippocampus part brain important memory . Avoiding hippocampus whole-brain radiation could decrease chance side effect memory thinking .

	<brief_title>Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy With Without Hippocampal Avoidance Treating Patients With Limited Stage Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether 12-month intracranial relapse rate follow hippocampal avoidance ( HA ) -prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) non-inferior compare rate follow PCI patient small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . ( Randomized Phase II Component [ Non-Inferiority ] ) II . Determine whether HA-PCI reduces likelihood 6-month deterioration baseline Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ( HVLT ) -Revised ( R ) delay recall compare PCI patient SCLC . ( Phase III Component [ Efficacy ] ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare time cognitive failure , measure battery test ( HVLT-R , Controlled Oral Word Association [ COWA ] test , Trail Making Test [ TMT ] part A B ) , PCI versus HA-PCI SCLC . II . Compare time cognitive failure separately measure test ( HVLT-R Total Recall Delayed Recognition , COWA test , TMT part A B ) , PCI versus HA-PCI SCLC . III . Compare patient-reported cognitive functioning quality life domain ( assess European Organization Research Treatment Cancer [ EORTC ] Quality Life Questionnaire [ QLQ ] -Core [ C ] 30 BN20 ) PCI versus HA-PCI patient SCLC . IV . Compare overall survival PCI versus HA-PCI patient SCLC . V. Compare 12-month intracranial relapse rate ( completion phase III ) time intracranial relapse PCI versus HA-PCI patient SCLC . VI . Evaluate adverse event accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) criterion . VII . Correlate change health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) domains change cognitive test outcome follow PCI versus HA-PCI patient SCLC . VIII . Assess cost-effectiveness HA-PCI ( intensity modulate radiation therapy [ IMRT ] ) PCI ( 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy [ 3DCRT ] ) use EuroQual ( EQ ) -5-Dimensions ( 5D ) -5L . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Collect serum , whole blood , urine future translational research analysis . II . Evaluate baseline magnetic resonance ( MR ) image biomarkers white matter injury hippocampal volumetry potential predictor cognitive decline differential benefit HAPCI compare PCI . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo PCI use 3DCRT daily 2 week . ARM II : Patients undergo PCI HA use IMRT daily 2 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year annually death .</detailed_description>
