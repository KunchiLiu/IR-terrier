	<brief_title>Get Going : Accelerometer-Based Intervention Promote Physical Activity Frail Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The transition hospital home critical old patient cardiovascular hospitalization , since 1 3 suffer fate functional decline repeat hospitalization within first 30 day . This tremendous impact patient , lead vicious cycle worsen health status disability , healthcare system , lead estimate $ 12 billion preventable cost . At policy level , prevent readmission become national priority forefront medical agenda . Frailty , geriatric syndrome characterize subclinical impairment multiple organ decrease physiologic resiliency , major risk factor unsuccessful transition care adverse health outcome . Thus , suggest intervention aim improve transition care target frail patient . Frail individual demonstrate well-defined phenotype muscle weakness physical inactivity , readily measurable use various scale instrument . To date , widely study intervention improve frailty relate outcomes physical activity . However , few 50 % patient adhere regular physical activity program . Enrollment cardiac rehabilitation program even low owe multiple barrier , include lack payer reimbursement ≤ 30 day hospitalization , high risk period readmission . Scientific statement call augment `` self-care '' assure adequate physical activity patient heart failure form cardiovascular disease 10 . Moreover , low-intensity home-based physical activity program efficacious higher-intensity center-based program , strengthen rationale self-care . The advent small , portable , inexpensive accelerometer device emerge powerful tool facilitate self-monitored physical activity . These device wear patient provide real-time feedback number step walk day ( well functional parameter ) . This tune systematic review find feedback goal set improved adherence physical activity patient heart failure . A study physical therapist literature use accelerometer demonstrate low baseline physical activity boost total step count patient attend cardiac rehabilitation , patient least 30 day remove index hospitalization , none enrol patient critical post-discharge phase . Research question : Is portable actigraphy-based intervention effective standard-of-care promote physical activity first 30 day hospital discharge among frail old adult cardiovascular disease ?</detailed_description>
