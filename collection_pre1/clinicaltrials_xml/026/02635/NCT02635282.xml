	<brief_title>IN Ketamine Vs IN Midazolam Fentanyl Abscess I &amp; D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pediatric emergency department , one main goal patient care provide adequate pain management . Many patient present emergency department condition injury cause acute chronic pain . Health care provider routinely aim treat patient ' pain timely manner arrival emergency department . A common scenario occur patient present condition treatment require potentially painful anxiety-provoking procedure perform ED , provider also strive treat pain anxiety accordingly . There several different method treat pain anxiety , include multiple type medication , give orally , intravenously , intramuscularly , intranasally . The use intranasal medication treatment pain anxiety steadily increase last decade , particularly helpful pediatric population . There several advantage use intranasal medication , include rapid onset , ease administration , lack need IV access . At time , pediatric emergency department use two different medication via intranasal route administration : fentanyl , synthetic opiate , midazolam , benzodiazepine , use pain control anxiolysis , respectively , two medication frequently use together . The objective study introduce ketamine third medication intranasal use observe effect pain control ; medication currently use either intravenously intramuscularly investigator 's ED . Ketamine anesthetic property analgesia amnesia generally favorable side effect profile . This study observe effect use medication already widely use investigator 's ED , use via different route administration , offer advantage option . In study , patient enrol diagnosed soft tissue abscess treat incision drainage ED . Patients one group give dose intranasal ketamine predetermine dose , measure variable include pain score , vital sign , patient and/or parent satisfaction , adverse effect , length stay , need additional dos ketamine additional medication . This group patient compare another group patient give intranasal fentanyl intranasal midazolam use randomization RedCap system . The investigator hypothesize use intranasal ketamine PED treat pain associate minor procedure incision drainage soft tissue abscess provide satisfactory pain control patient offer advantage treatment option , compare patient treat current standard intranasal medication .</detailed_description>
