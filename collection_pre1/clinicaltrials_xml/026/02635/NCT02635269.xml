	<brief_title>Fat Sugar Metabolism During Exercise Patients With Metabolic Myopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients compare group match healthy control subject ( match age , gender , physical activity level BMI ) comparison primary secondary outcome measure . Methods : Each subject go 3 test day . Test day 1 : - International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) . The result use match patient control subject . - DEXA-scan . This used estimate volume distribution stable isotope tracer . - Maximal oxidative capacity test ( max-test ) . On cycle ergometer , subject exercise approximately 15 minute increase resistance exhaustion . The peak oxidative workload capacity compare healthy control use find workload corresponds 55-65 % VO2max use follow exercise test . - Blood sample . Samples draw exercise exhaustion analyze plasma concentration glucose , lactate , ammonia , creatine kinase myoglobin . Test day 2 : •Long exercise test # 1 . The purpose test measure total fat sugar oxidation rate exercise use stable isotope tracer . Subjects arrive laboratory 3-9 hour fast . One IV-catheter inserted cubital vein one arm another peripheral vein hand . The stable isotope tracer give cubital vein constant infusion solution : - [ U-13C ] -palmitate ( 0.0026 mg x kg-1 x min-1 , prim bolus 0.085 mg x kg-1 NaH13CO3 ) - [ 1,1,2,3,3-2H5 ] -glycerol ( 0.0049 mg x kg-1 x min-1 ) - [ 6.6-2H2 ] -glucose ( 0.0728 mg x kg-1 x min-1 ) For two hour subject rest receive infusion tracer distribute body reach steady state . After rest , subject exercise cycle-ergometer exhaustion maximum 1 hour intensity correspond 55-65 % VO2max . The heart rate continuously measure exercise , every minute subject evaluate his/her degree exertion ( Rate Perceived Exertion , RPE ) Borg scale . •Blood breath sample From 20 minute exercise every ten minute end exercise , blood sample draw sample expire breath collected.The breath analyse 13CO2 -enrichment . The blood analyse plasma concentration glucose , lactate , ammonia , creatine kinase myoglobin . Test day 3 : •Long exercise test # 2 . The purpose test investigate exercise capacity performance measure HR , VO2 RPE prolong exercise . To mimic condition work muscle healthy person intact metabolism , patient give infusion 10 % glucose solution maintain blood sugar exercise . Subjects arrive laboratory 3-9 hour fast . After 2 hour rest , subject exercise cycle-ergometer exhaustion maximum 1 hour intensity correspond 60-65 % VO2max , like test day 2 . This time subject give stable isotope tracer . 10 minute exercise , subject give bolus glucose solution 0.2 g/kg cubital vein catheter constant infusion 10 % glucose solution start ( 100ml/h ) . The infusion continue throughout exercise period . Assessments heart rate , Rate Perceived Exertion blood sample follow protocol test day 1 , except breath sample take analysis stable isotope make , since tracer use test day 3 . - Blood sample . From 20 minute exercise every ten minute end exercise , blood sample draw . The blood analyse plasma concentration glucose , lactate , ammonia , creatine kinase myoglobin . - Muscle Biopsy At end test day 1 investigator perform voluntary muscle biopsy . Statistical Methods : The investigator use paired t-test , two-tailed testing ( correspond non-parametric test , assumption normality meet ) . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Results report Confidence Intervals difference mean . SigmaPlot version 11.0 ( similar statistical program ) use statistical analysis . No interim analysis make 4 day trial period . In case , patient withdraws/is withdrawn , obtain data complete test include analysis . Raw data clearly indisputably result error measurement include ( evaluate investigator ) . Missing lose data possible reassess .</detailed_description>
