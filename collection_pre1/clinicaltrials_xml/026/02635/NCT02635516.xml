	<brief_title>Traumatic Brain Injury Veterans Near-Infrared Phototherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence traumatic brain injury widespread . The Centers Disease Control estimate 1.7 million TBIs occur year TBI contribute factor 30 % injury-related death . In addition , 75 % TBIs concussion , mild TBIs ( mTBI ) . However , concussion , especially multiple concussion occur time , harmless . The damage even mild TBI potentially lead neuropsychiatric sequela . Moreover , injury brain worsen time depend degree inflammatory response area injury . TBI induce number neuropathological change like aggregation beta amyloid tau protein along neuroinflammatory change resemble pathology degenerative disease . For many return Veterans , improvise explosive device ( IEDs ) cause TBIs . For example , data Defense Manpower Data Center indicate October 3 , 2011 , explosive device responsible estimate two-thirds battlefield injury Iraq ; 46,532 warrior wound Operations Enduring Freedom Iraqi Freedom , 30,347 wound explosive device , many IEDs . Most injury involve concussive brain injury . While current estimate 15-19 % return Warfighters history acute concussion TBI tour ( ) duty . It note `` 22.8 % Brigade Combat Team return Iraq confirm deployment-acquired traumatic brain injury . '' Currently , effective treatment reverse reduce brain damage follow TBI . Confounding situation , symptom TBI often overlap post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) headache , dizziness , irritability , memory impairment , delay problem solving , slow reaction time , fatigue , visual disturbance , sleep disturbance , sensitivity light noise , impulsivity , judgment problem , emotional outburst , depression , anxiety . In addition , rate depression , anxiety , psychological symptom markedly elevate TBI survivor , base study involve large sample patient . As result complexity overlap symptom TBI , PTSD , depression , clear diagnosis TBI challenging , lead misdirect treatment effort hamper ability accurately assess treatment response . Multiple publish research study validate heal mechanism NIR , deliver via light-emitting diode ( LED ) . NIR phototherapy use extensively wound heal soft tissue , increase circulation , treatment pain specific condition hair growth carpal tunnel syndrome . The mechanism action central heal effect NIR increase blood circulation via release nitric oxide red blood cell . Local increase nitric oxide increase blood flow artery , vein lymphatic duct . Increased return flow treat site help diminish intracellular acidosis could alter mitochondrial membrane potential ( ) . This hypothesis hold blood flow adequate , provide sufficient amount oxygen glucose cell adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) generation mitochondrion . However , even modest decrease regional global blood flow brain , see TBI , limit amount glucose oxygen deliver neuron . Restoring blood flow level damage region brain thus restore necessary level glucose oxygen require ATP generation proper neuronal functioning . In addition , nitric oxide stimulate angiogenesis increase number capillary aid increase blood flow ( oxygen glucose ) injure area brain blood flow subnormal . This effect contribute enhance mitochondrial function . The 1998 Nobel Prize physiology award Furchgott , Ignarroand , Murad discovery nitric oxide act signal molecule activates enzyme , guanylate cyclase ( GC ) , necessary subsequent vasodilation . Finally , nitric oxide effective analgesic ; appear reduce pain either reverse local ischemia directly manner akin analgesic effect morphine . In latter case , nitric oxide help regulate membrane potential via alteration activity ATP dependent potassium channel . This effect may mediate activated GC subsequent phosphorylation potassium channel . Due capacity non-invasively penetrate skull , NIR safely use since late 1970s determination cerebral blood flow oxygen level brain injured adult , post-stroke patient , pediatric patient . Furthermore , transcranial NIR show increase cortical perfusion associate clinical improvement human subject traumatic brain injury , neurodegenerative disease , depression . The NIR device study FDA clear ( 510K ; K101894 ) increase circulation reduce pain .</detailed_description>
