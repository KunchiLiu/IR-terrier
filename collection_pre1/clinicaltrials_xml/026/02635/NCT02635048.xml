	<brief_summary>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) consider first-line choice management &gt; 20mm kidney stone . The traditional nephrostomy tract PNL dilate 24-30F , refer `` Standard-PCNL '' . Standard PNL ideal stone free rate ( SFR ) , however , cost severe morbidity . To decrease disadvantage relate standard PNL , `` mini-perc '' `` mini-PCNL '' , 20F less , first introduce pediatric procedure 1997 , subsequently implement adult expectation similar SFR low morbidity past twenty year . Although abundant effort do , whether mini-perc outweigh standard-PNL treatment &gt; 20mm calculis term efficiency safety remain controversial . To solve problem , perform multi-center randomized control trial ( RCT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mini-PCNL Versus Standard-PCNL For The Management 20-40 mm Size Kidney Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate efficacy safety mini-PCNL versus standard-PCNL management 20-40 mm size kidney stones.Investigators plan multi-center international randomize control trial ( RCT ) . There 44 hospital include study , include The First Affiliated Hospital Guangzhou Medical University , Shenzhen People 's Hospital , The First Affiliated Hospital Guangxi Medical University , Affiliated Hospital Guilin Medical University , The first people 's Hospital Kashi , The First People 's Hospital Yulin , The Central Hospital Shaoyang , Jiangmen Central Hospital , People 's Hospital Nanhai District , Foshan , The second Affiliated Hospital Kunming Medical University , The First Affiliated Hospital Nanhua University , Luoding People 's Hospital , Qingyuan People 's Hospital , The second Affiliated Hospital Harbin Medical University , Chongqing Daping Hospital , Zhuzhou Central Hospital , HuiZhou Municipal Central Hospital , Jining NO.1 People 's Hospital , Suzhou Municipal Hospital , The General Hospital Shenyang Military , The Second Affiliated Hospital Soochow University , ShengJing Hospital Of China Medical University , Yichang Yiling Hospital , Jiangsu Province Hospital , Beijing Chuiyangliu Hospital , Renji Hospital Shanghai Jiaotong University School Medicine , The First Affiliated Hospital Gannan Medical University , The First Affiliated Hospital Fujian Medical University , Fuling Center Hospital Chongqing City , Baoshan No.2 People 's Hospital , Fujian Medical University Union Hospital , Shanghai General Hospital , The First Affiliated Hospital Xiamen University , 181st hospital Chinese People 's Liberation Army , Danyang People 's Hospital Jiangsu Province , The fifth hospital People 's Liberation Army , Affiliated Hospital Hebei University , The 159th Central Hospital People 's Liberation Army , Guizhou Provincial People 's Hospital , Venus International Hospital , Lions Kidney Hospital , Global Rainbow Healthcare Istituto Clinico Humanitas . This study start December,2015 end November,2017.At least 1950 patient 20-40mm renal calculus enrolled.By simple random sampling technique , patient assign two 975-patient group ( mini-PCNL group standard-PCNL group ) . All patient diagnose definitely operation non-contrast CT , along plain radiography ( kidney ureter bladder , KUB ) , IVP Ultrasound . Patients positive preoperative urine culture treat suitable antibiotic base culture sensitivity result least 72 h standard PNL/mini-perc . Patients negative urine culture receive single dose broad spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis prior procedure . Surgical technique Under general epidural anaesthesia , patient initially place lithotomy position , 5 Fr 6Fr ureteral catheter insert kidney fix 16 Fr Foley catheter . Then patient turn prone position . The choice use C-arm fluoroscopic ultrasonography guidance combination fashion percutaneous access make discretion treat urologist . The length needle skin collect system measure ensure length dilator appropriate . No patient underwent bilateral simultaneous PCNL patient bilateral stone underwent surgery 4 week apart Mini-PCNL group : The access tract dilate fascial dilator 8F 18F . We define access collect system gain entry target urinary system desire calix . For complex case , indicate require multiple tract , additional tract create session . The stone fragment pneumatic lithotripsy Holmium : YAG laser lithotripsy 8/9.8F semirigid ureteroscope ( Richard Wolf , Germany ) . The large fragment extract forcept , small fragment flush endoscopic pulsed perfusion pump . A silastic nephrostomy tube place end procedure 4-6Fr double pigtail ureteral stent leave 2 week operation . X-ray check residual stone fragment also perform end procedure . Standard-PCNL group : The access tract dilate 8F maximum 24 F use fascial dilator . Rigid nephroscope use . Stones fragment pneumatic lithotripsy , Holmium : YAG laser lithotripsy EMS . The rest procedure describe patient mini-perc group . Patients candidate tubeless procedure follow strict condition meet : single percutaneous tract , absence major perforation collect system bleeding , complete stone clearance assess intraoperative nephroscopy fluoroscopy end procedure . For tubeless procedure , flank compress 5 min . Patient monitor postoperative complication . Data collection Data 2 group -demographic characteristic , site target calix , site access , S.T.O.N.E score , hemoglobin drop , postoperative pain , duration procedure , hospital stay , case tubeless , complication ( modify Clavien system ) , stone clearance ( SFR postoperative day 1 1 month follow-up ) , serum level marker systemic response surgery-induced tissue trauma ( CRP ) need auxiliary treatment ( example , re-miniperc , RIRS ESWL ) - compare . Main study endpoint : The endpoint SFR postoperative day 1 1 month follow-up . The endpoint include complication , case tubeless hospital stay . Initial SFR assess KUB day 1 operation . Non-contrast CT obtain patient 1 month operation evaluate final SFR , allow time spontaneous passage stone fragment . Any information concern need auxiliary treatment ( example , re-miniperc , RIRS ESWL ) record . Stone-free status define either absence residual stone fragment presence clinically insignificant residual stone fragment kidney define ≦ 4mm , asymptomatic , non-obstructive non-infectious stone particle . The stone size define large diameter single stone plain abdominal radiograph kidney ureter bladder ( KUB ) and/or non-contrast CT . In case multiple stone , summation large diameter stone use . Demographic characteristic include age , sex , BMI , stone size location , etc . Operation time define time puncture placement nephrostomy tube . Hospital stay define day surgery date discharge date . Postoperative pain ( visual analogue scale [ VAS ] , use analgesic ) record . The rate hemoglobin drop assess compare preoperative Hb level 24-hour postoperative Hb level . If procedure consider successful , pigtail stent remove outpatient 2weeks . Follow-up include non-contrast CT generally schedule 1 month . Bleeding severity judge treat surgeon , transfusion administer accord local practice guideline . Complications patient record accord modify Clavien classification system .</detailed_description>
