	<brief_summary>Legalization marijuana Colorado medicinal recreational purpose lead perception safety , well study pregnant lactate woman . The psychoactive component marijuana , delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) lipophilic therefore presume secrete breast milk . Additionally , difference mode consumption ( ie . smoke vs. edible ) well describe regard THC concentration breast milk . The purpose small pilot study describe presence duration THC expression breast milk among woman evidence THC exposure time labor delivery within 72 hour delivery . The researcher hypothesize woman positive urine drug screen THC within 72 hour delivery may excrete THC breast milk predict period time , therefore aim project determine time safely return breastfeed decrease infant exposure THC . The specific aim determine woman test positive THC delivery : 1 . Determine length time THC metabolite detect breast milk mother positive urine drug screen time presentation labor delivery within 72 hour delivery . 2 . Determine length time THC metabolite detect breast milk mother postnatal exposure either ingest inhaled marijuana , inform recommendation safely return breastfeed . 3 . Describe modes marijuana consumption woman present delivery correlate THC concentration persistence breast milk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational pilot study identify woman within 72 hour delivery positive urine drug screen THC intend breastfeed . Eligibility dependent upon disposition infant , either discharge shortly birth infant NICU admission . The study last six week time enrollment . Mothers consent participate complete in-person survey marijuana use exposure pregnancy study entry weekly survey current marijuana use . Samples maternal breast milk , maternal urine , infant urine collect least three time , five time week ( Monday - Friday ) infant hospitalization , dependent maternal availability . If infant discharge hospital , visit occur twice weekly out-patient clinic visit .

Mothers infant NICU would encourage pump breast milk dump , 2 week last THC exposure use formula return breastfeed . As issue commonly encounter clinical practice , investigator find many mother commit provide safe feeding infant give education regard concern THC impact infant development . The time point safely return breast milk follow THC exposure unknown , primary aim study . There numerous document benefit breast milk , especially preterm infant however sufficient literature exist question safety THC 's effect develop brain may also particularly susceptible prematurity . Due unknown understudied highly concern effect , The researcher faculty Neonatology practice agree consensus refrain knowingly administer breast milk mother actively use THC . Exemptions occur certain clinical setting . If occur mother 's study enrollment , subsequent sample would mark appropriately analytical data carefully examine .</detailed_description>
