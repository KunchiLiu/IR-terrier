	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome heterogeneous condition characterize disordered reproductive metabolic function account myriad clinical feature include androgen excess , chronic anovulation , insulin resistance adiposity , dyslipidemia . This syndrome highly prevalent , affect 8 18 % female population , depend diagnostic criterion use . Hyperandrogenism , ovarian dysfunction metabolic abnormalities - main determinant PCOS - appear involve synergistic way pathophysiology PCOS . Women PCOS likely obese : 38 88 % woman PCOS overweight obese , although PCOS also manifest lean woman . Obesity , particularly abdominal obesity , play central role development PCOS , exacerbate reproductive metabolic dysfunction . Rather absolute body weight , distribution fat important central ( visceral ) adiposity risk factor . Visceral adipose tissue metabolically active subcutaneous fat amount visceral fat correlate insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia . Weight gain also often important pathogenic factor , PCOS usually become clinically manifest woman presumable genetic predisposition PCOS subsequently gain weight . Therefore , environmental ( particularly dietary ) factor important . However , BMI also influence genetic factor fat mass obesity-associated protein , obesity highly heritable condition . Therefore , weight gain responsible manifestation PCOS many woman condition influence genetic factor . Ethnicity , genetic background , personal family history , degree obesity must take account might aggravate even trigger metabolic disturbance woman PCOS . Moreover , incidence glucose intolerance , dyslipidemia , gestational diabetes , type 2 diabetes ( DM2 ) increase woman PCOS weight level young age . PCOS may important risk factor ethnicity race glucose intolerance young woman . The exact factor responsible excess risk woman PCOS identify ; family history DM 2 , obesity , insulin resistance , beta cell ( ß-cell ) secretory dysfunction , hyperandrogenism possible candidate . With good understand pathophysiology , metabolic consequence syndrome evident . Therefore , patient need follow even present complaint adequately resolve . Lifestyle modification key component improvement reproductive function overweight , anovulatory woman PCOS . Even modest weight loss 5 % total body weight restore ovulation overweight woman PCOS . Features PCOS ( e.g. , hirsutism , testosterone level , insulin resistance , menstrual cyclicity ovulation ) show marked improvement , PCOS frequently resolve substantial weight loss induce bariatric surgery . Recently number anti-diabetes medication approve facilitate weight loss improve underlying insulin resistance . We report treatment glucagon like peptide -1 ( GLP-1 ) agonist , exenatide 24 week superior single agent metformin treatment improve insulin action reduce body weight hyperandrogenism obese woman PCOS . We observe exenatide treatment significantly improve first-phase insulin response oral glucose administration . Since aberrant first-phase insulin secretion impair suppression endogenous glucose production major contributor postprandial hyperglycemia development type 2 diabetes , effect exenatide weekly [ EQW ( 2 mg ) ] target defect , normalize glucose excursion likely clinically significant obese patient PCOS . Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT-2 ) inhibitor new class medication diabetes management investigate use woman PCOS . The SGLT2 inhibitor , dapagliflozin [ DAPA ( 10 mg/day ) ] insulin-independent action , promotes weight loss , low incidence hypoglycemia , complement action antidiabetic agent . The loss glucose attendant caloric loss contributes weight loss ; addition , improvement β cell function see . Because SGLT2 inhibitor distinct mechanism action independent insulin secretion , efficacy class drug anticipate decline presence severe insulin resistance . The weight loss see SGLT2 inhibitor similar see glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist , may acceptable oral agent . The result weight loss assist decrease insulin resistance , lead increase glucose disposal thus contribute increase insulin secretion-insulin sensitivity ( ISSI ) index , primary outcome measure . The non-diabetic female PCOS offer unique model study relationship insulin resistance adiposity . Women PCOS demonstrate abnormal body composition characterize great percent body fat , body fat mass , increase ratio fat lean mass ( F/L ratio ) . Studies use dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) methodology report high degree metabolic dysfunction patient PCOS appear directly associate high F/L ratio . Given monotherapy combine therapy exenatide weekly ( EQW ) , dapagliflozin ( DAPA ) along DAPA/ metformin XR therapy associate weight loss introduces confounder current study since prevents distinguish direct effect compound β-cell function vs. effect due reduce adiposity . To control loss body mass provide appropriate intervention remain study arm propose use comparator weight loss drug alone , combination phentermine ( PHEN ) /topiramate ( TPM ) extend release ( ER ) . To avoid confound relationship body fat insulin resistance , enroll obese non-diabetic woman PCOS . All patient receive diet lifestyle counselling , include advice exercise , accord usual clinical routine commence lead-in period continue throughout study We propose randomize , single-blind , parallel 5 treatment group 24-week trial design directly compare therapeutic effect exenatide weekly ( EQW ) , dapagliflozin ( DAPA ) , EQW plus DAPA , combine DAPA/metformin ER weight loss medication , phentermine/topiramate extend release ( PHEN/TPM ER ) metabolic endocrinological parameter obese non-diabetic woman PCOS .</detailed_description>
