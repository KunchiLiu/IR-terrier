	<brief_summary>This study second Phase-II trial analyze efficacy outcomes PBF-680 asthmatic subject , follow supportive data proof-of-concept trial effect PBF-680 airway hyperresponsiveness adenosine monophasphate ( AMP ) . The purpose present study provide assessment efficacy 5-day treatment course daily , orally administer , 10-mg PBF-680 dos , attenuate `` Late Asthmatic Responses '' ( LAR ) primary efficacy outcome . The study also aim analyze effect PBF-680 treatment course airway inflammation-related outcome include airway hyperresponsiveness AMP 24 h allergen bronchoprovocation , plus nitric oxide fraction exhale air ( FeNO ) airway inflammatory cell count induce sputum effect additional 10-mg PBF-680 dose 6th treatment period day . Overall , study aim provide evidence efficacy PBF-680 outcome , particularly LAR , well establish screen valid drug asthma maintenance therapy .</brief_summary>
