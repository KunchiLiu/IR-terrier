	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation common form arrhythmia , affect three percent population . The condition carry increase risk thromboembolism , particular stroke . In 2013 approximately 25000 acute stroke diagnose Sweden , result death severe disability nearly half case . Numerous study show risk stroke reduce approximately 60-70 % use anticoagulant therapy patient one several risk factor stroke concurrent atrial fibrillation . The European Society Cardiology recommend use CHA2DS2VASc algorithm identify person increase risk stroke set atrial fibrillation . Prophylaxis recommend CHA2DS2VASc ≥ 1 ( female gender ) . The agent use include warfarin recently develop non-vitamin k oral anticoagulant ( NOACs ) . Despite good evidence recommendation current guideline , however , remain substantial undertreatment group patient . The Swedish Association Local Authorities Regions show 63 % patient CHA2DS2VASc score ≥ 2 prescribed anticoagulant therapy [ 7 ] . The reason likely multifactorial , include ignorance CHA2DS2VASc algorithm well reluctance use potent drug doctor patient . Furthermore , high pace modern medicine increase risk miss diagnosis atrial fibrillation and/or condition constitute CHA2DS2VASc algorithm . Clinical decision tool relatively new phenomenon modern medicine show promising result , evidence clinical outcome sparse . The clinical decision tool stroke prevention ( CDSS ) develop collaboration Cambio Cosmic ( supplier electronic journal county Östergötland ) , Cardiology Department Linköping University hospital primary care professional . The decision tool activate patient logged electronic journal . If patient diagnosis atrial fibrillation ( atrial flutter ) CHA2DS2VASc score ≥ 1 ( female gender ) without current anticoagulant therapy , screen warn appear . By click warning , responsible physician get overview patient 's diagnosis accord CHA2DS2VASc algorithm . Furthermore , calculation estimate stroke risk come year appear , link national guideline provide . The physician thereafter decide prescribe anticoagulant therapy accordance current guideline , alternatively , postpone decision/make decision refrain medication . In case choice make refrain medication physician ask choose set predetermine reason order monitor main reason deviation guideline . If , hand , patient anticoagulant therapy accordance current guideline , screen warn appear . CDSS show promising result pilot study conduct five unit County Östergötland fall 2014 . The aim present study investigate computerize decision tool large randomize trial primary care set . Study design The present study cluster randomize study primary care set County Östergötland , Sweden . The investigator intend include primary care unit ( n = 43 ) County Östergötland . Participation non-compulsory . The population County Östergötland 442 105 ( December 2014 ) At time inclusion primary care unit stratify four stratum base number patient list unit current adherence guideline ( i.e . percentage patient diagnosis atrial fibrillation CHA2DS2VASc ≥ 1 ( female gender ) currently prescribe anticoagulant therapy ) . They thereafter randomize intervention CDSS application serve control unit ( continue usual care , randomize 1:1 ) . Prior randomization participate general practitioner receive education atrial fibrillation associate risk stroke , include CHA2DS2VASc algorithm overview anticoagulant therapy . Furthermore , unit receive CDSS brief technical aspect use application .</detailed_description>
