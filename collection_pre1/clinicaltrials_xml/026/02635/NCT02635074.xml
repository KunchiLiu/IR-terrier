	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ibrutinib give together idarubicin cytarabine treat patient acute myeloid leukemia return period improvement respond previous treatment . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , idarubicin cytarabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving ibrutinib together idarubicin cytarabine may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib , Idarubicin Cytarabine Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify safety recommend phase 2 dose ibrutinib combination idarubicin/cytarabine relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily assess induction response rate ( complete remission [ CR ] /complete remission incomplete count [ CRi ] ) ibrutinib combination idarubicin/cytarabine relapsed/refractory AML . II . To preliminarily assess overall survival ibrutinib combination idarubicin/cytarabine relapsed/refractory AML . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ibrutinib . INDUCTION : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , idarubicin intravenously ( IV ) 15 minute day 1-3 cytarabine IV continuously day 1-4 . CONSOLIDATION : Patients achieve CR CRi may receive ibrutinib PO QD day 1-21 , idarubicin IV 15 minute day 1-2 cytarabine IV continuously day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients maintain CR/CRi may receive ibrutinib PO QD day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
