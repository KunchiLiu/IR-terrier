	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct prospective , randomized trial assess impact neuromuscular blockade early ( &lt; 72 hour post-ICU admission ) postoperative respiratory complication cardiac surgical patient . The study compare continual neuromuscular blockade cisatracurium single dose succinylcholine general anesthesia cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Residual neuromuscular blockade immediate postoperative period important patient safety issue . Although used facilitate technical performance surgery , clinical study associate neuromuscular blockade ( NMB ) increase incidence postoperative respiratory complication . This effect likely mediate residual neuromuscular blockade interfere airway tone respiratory effort , lead postoperative pneumonia , atelectasis aspiration . However , vast majority study involve non-cardiac patient population , yet patient undergoing cardiac surgery even susceptible detrimental effect residual neuromuscular blockade number reason . Despite widespread utilization paralysis cardiac surgery , little know residual neuromuscular blockade patient follow cardiac surgery . Previously publish clinical study date decade ago base retrospective database non-cardiac surgery patient , preclude generalizable conclusion . Given substantial role neuromuscular blockade traditional management cardiac surgical patient , prospective data need determine veracity association well surgical tolerability protocol minimize intraoperative paralysis . The investigator conduct prospective , randomized trial assess impact neuromuscular blockade early ( &lt; 72 hour post-ICU admission ) postoperative respiratory complication .</detailed_description>
