	<brief_title>Magnetic Seed Localisation Breast Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Breast Cancer Breast cancer heterogeneous disease , great diversity site , size progression tumour . Some palpable discovered patient , though many first detect mammogram screening . For cancer , localisation necessary prior surgery , guide surgeon target excision site . Wire Guided Localisation Traditionally , localisation involve radiographic-guided insertion wire breast , position wire tip centre lesion . However , procedure carry several logistical limitation , stem fact wire localisation must perform day surgery . This minimise risk wire migration dislodgement , significant possibility due external section wire leave protrude breast . Same-day appointment demand excellent coordination radiological department operate theatre ensure disruption procedure schedule minimise . Delays may result technically difficult procedure , lead over-running radiology appointment knock effect operating list . Additionally , cancel operation result precede wire guidance procedure become unnecessary , result wasted staff hour . Another limitation wire guidance occur wire directs surgeon along linear route . Lesions find point along wire , though difficult determine far along find . For reason , surgeon make initial incision may dictate visual trajectory wire , rather location lesion . This lead excessive dissection sub optimal cosmetic result . Radioactive Seed Localisation Radioactive seed localisation ( RSL ) localisation technique less commonly use United Kingdom ( UK ) . A radioactive seed insert 5 day surgery , thus eliminate requirement radiology appointment day patient 's operation . The seed detect theatre use handheld gamma probe . The gamma probe direct surgeon single specific point via short route , whereas , wire often transect breast , mean surgeon commonly end dissect across normal tissue locate tip wire . In addition , RSL , distraction external projection wire , surgeon guide purely audible response seed . It hypothesise advantage RSL lead improved surgical technique reduce pressure theatre schedule . However , , little evidence demonstrate clear superiority surgical outcome one localisation technique . Several study find low positive margin rate patient undergo RSL versus wire guidance , , . This mean edge excise tissue less commonly involve cancerous tissue , suggest RSL accurately localise cancerous lesion . Conversely , many study , include one large trial date , conclude variability surgical outcome . Regardless stance surgical outcome , study note RSL offer significant improvement schedule appointment patient convenience . However , radioactive technique without limitation . Several study evaluate use standard radioisotope blue dye injection sentinel node biopsy . Each study comment complex legislation regulating use radioisotope , particularly regard operator train correct disposal handle . In addition , radioisotope use increase patient healthcare worker radiation exposure , though minimal , would preferable avoid . Iron Oxide Use Breast Surgery Several study investigate use liquid injection iron oxide rather traditional radioisotope blue dye injection , sentinel node identification . Following iron oxide injection , handheld magnetometer use detect location iron oxide lymph node . All study conclude iron oxide particle perform equally well standard radioisotope &amp; blue dye injection sentinel node identification , demonstrate potential widespread use technique . In addition , Ahmed et al test localisation cancerous lesion use magnetic tracer injection . The tracer successfully localise tumour result appropriate excisional margin , without excess tissue excision ; thus demonstrate feasibility magnetic tracer localisation tumour . Sentimark Magnetic Localisation The localisation method project concern similar principle RSL . However , instead radioactive seed , soft magnetic seed call Sentimark , place breast . The seed similar biopsy clip detect use handheld magnetometer call Sentimag . The Sentimag probe emits alternate magnetic field detects magnetic response Sentimark seed . The magnetometer produce audible response hold close Sentimark seed use surgeon locate target excision site . Sentimark inserted week operation , ideally biopsy appointment , patient convenience . This study first investigate magnetic seed localisation tumour . It hypothesise use magnetic seed rather injection magnetic tracer allow accurate detection localisation use Sentimag probe . This probe detect magnetic field produce single discrete object , rather collection iron oxide-containing liquid may disperse throughout breast . Summary Localisation Techniques The coordination schedule difficulty encounter wire guide localisation , alongside logistical safety issue radioisotope usage , highlight requirement innovation acquisition new technology field localisation . It hop magnetic seed localisation act feasible alternative exist technology . Use magnetism localisation techniques offer potential alternative wire guidance RSL . An important consideration deployment new seed whether size shape seed sufficiently similar previous design show similar migration pattern , movement seed prior surgery cause incomplete lesion excision en-suing requirement re-operation increase risk recurrence . The migration performance Sentimark implantation trial goat , mean migration 1.1mm range 0 3.6mm ( N=10 ) , similar observe Alderliesten , et al . report mean migration 0.8mm , range 0 2.8mm ( N=10 ) RSL seed consider `` clinically negligible '' RSL human breast lesion . However , confirmation require magnetic marker performs expect clinic . The study test soft magnetic seed ( Sentimark ) accompany handheld magnetic probe ( Sentimag ) particular consideration safety performance place human breast tissue . Device The device study small ( 5mm x 0.9mm ) metal magnetic marker ( seed ) soft magnetic property . This mean exposed magnetic field become magnetic . The magnetism detect use magnetometer probe give audible visual signal strength response seed directional accurately guide user site magnetic seed . The magnetometer CE ( Conformite Europeene ) approve device use worldwide detect iron oxide sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure , proven clinical practice . The seed deploy radiologist centre tumour site use similar technique use currently place wire breast . The seed cylindrical vivo study goats show similar migration performance see radioactive seed human breast tissue . The seed also test animal tissue model ( University Hospital South Manchester ) UHSM radiologists surgeon , model safely deployed radiologist use exist technique . The device detect surgical resection perform 100 % accuracy specimens . There radiation exposure device . Study Population Adult woman capacity consent proven breast cancer require breast remove mastectomy surgery . Potential Risks Patients The device small piece metal offer likely safety risk . - Migration seed - seed cylindrical therefore place breast potential migrate along path needle use deploy . When deployed mammary soft tissue animal model device migrate . This study involve place device woman mastectomy even device migrates affect patient cancer care ( whole breast remove along device matter locate breast ) ; - Failure detect seed - seed small magnetic field generate proportional size seed . This study aim ass whether seed detect size breast case may possible seed lie deep breast detect use magnetometer . To ensure safe resection cancer , patient study under-going planned mastectomy , ensure device fully remove even detection fail ; - Tissue acceptance - seed produce single material demonstrate biocompatibility ISO-10993 biocompatibility evaluation include demonstration tissue acceptance mammary tissue goat ( 28-day implantation period ) . Bone wax use terminal plug Sentimark device . Bone wax commonly use purpose brachytherapy RSL needle . Some reaction bone wax may occur , allergic reaction foreign body reaction ( e.g . granuloma ) , bone wax minimally resorbable implantable substance . Potential Benefits The study carry patient require mastectomy . In population , full cycle marker ( seed ) deployment removal evaluate , breast remove part plan cancer treatment , patient treatment unaffected magnetic seed perform intend . However , direct benefit patient take part study potential benefit study limit advancement medical knowledge . If study confirm magnetic marker ( seed ) safe method feasible , device potential use localisation breast cancer lumpectomy surgery .</detailed_description>
