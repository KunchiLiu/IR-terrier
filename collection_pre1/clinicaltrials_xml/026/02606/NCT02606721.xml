	<brief_title>Food Allergy Challenge Diagnostic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients often discover food allergy consume give food experience subsequent allergic reaction . The majority patient ( 75 % ) consult food allergist formal diagnosis treatment information . With respect patient quality life , tremendous benefit confirm diagnosis food allergy often patient unsure source reaction outside office . Allergists conduct Skin Prick Test ( SPT ) ass serum specific IgE level screen specific food protein sensitivity . However , positive response SPT specific IgE confirm sensitivity , 70 % case patient respond positively SPT specific IgE test NOT manifest allergic response food consumption . To address issue , food allergist recommend oral food challenge control set confirm allergic response consume suspect food . The oral food challenge ( OFC ) consist consume escalate level suspect food , ( usually mix applesauce control baked good ) , either reaction manifest challenge complete reaction . The food challenge process pose significant risk patient . In 5 % case , patient experience severe allergic response require use epinephrine . These response typically consist severe reaction GI respiratory arise challenge patient higher dos food allergen necessary prove mild allergic response , directly link variability diagnosis positive response , within subject within investigator . The investigator hypothesize measurement take use minimally-invasive diagnostic test course escalating-dose oral food challenge able detect positive response systemic reaction occur patient may able screen individual predispose EOE .</detailed_description>
