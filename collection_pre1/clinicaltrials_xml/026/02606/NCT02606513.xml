After hydration , low-dose unenhanced CT acquire top kidney base bladder , follow first low-dose diuretic 1-2 minute later contrast injection . Imaging strategy administration contrast material controversial different protocol available aim mainly detect rule possible malignancy scientific evidence available superiority specific protocol . Contrast enhance abdominal scan obtain corticomedullary phase ( 25-35 delay start contrast injection ) nephrographic ( delay 90-110 ) combination nephrographic-corticomedullary ( call dose-efficient arterial-nephrographic-corticomedullary phase split contrast injection two three bolus modify protocol . The third excretory phase ( 240-480 delay ) important scan purpose achieve excellent endoluminal opacification , preferably UUT dilatation . Even good result report acquisition delay 720 improved depiction lower ureter opacification UUT segment sensitive delay time . When low-dose furosemide administer , excretory phase delay may reduce average 450 s. The CTU protocol call split-technique considerably different protocol contrast bolus . The main idea administration one bolus contrast follow variable delay 480-1,000 ( recent practice report 600-660 delay ) follow injection second contrast bolus . After constant delay 90-120 second bolus , abdominal scan acquire first inject contrast already excrete , acquisition contains combine nephrographic excretory phase one scan therefore reduce radiation dose . Further modification split-bolus technique include triple-bolus contrast injection acquisition combine corticomedullary-nephrographic-excretory phase data 510 start first bolus without low-dose diuretics‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ ‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ Imaging UUT MRI challenging , image modality MRU , strengths weakness . MRI susceptible various artefact include chemical shift misregisteration , wraparound , phase-encoded motion susceptibility artefact , might prominent high field strength‬ . Furthermore stand wave conductivity artifact ‬are notice obese ascites patient 3T image . Therefore good knowledge experience normal anatomy artefact prerequisite correct image interpretation . MRI lengthy examination need patient cooperation . Breath-hold ultrafast sequence use parallel imaging reduces image time useful obtain high quality image hence help reduce movement artifact . It also beneficial raise arm head coronal imaging prevent wraparound artifact . In investigator ' experience reader always familiar artefact relate enhanced excretion urine void line turbulence artefacts especially dilate pelvis . The investigator also recommend image UUT routinely axial coronal plane excretory phase.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ The inability visualize calcification consider limitation use MRU evaluation UUT stone disease . Indeed possible stone visualize partial complete intraluminal filling defect nonspecific differentiate blood clot tumor . Nevertheless , clot usually hyperintense unenhanced sequence enhance administration contrast additionally margin soft-tissue abnormality usually irregular compare well-defined margin calculus . Opposite tumor usually enhance . Therefore MRU protocol include T2 T1 sequence latter pre- postcontrast sequence . The failure might result misinterpretation , yet occasionally severe edema might misinterpret possible tumo . Different result literature interpret caution variability use sequence selection bias . Not study evaluate performance MRU use T1 T2 sequence previously mention , T2 sequence alone insufficient evaluate cause obstruction . MRU show superior IVU detection UUT stone . MRU find least accurate helical CT evaluation patient acute flank pain . Also presence secondary sign obstruction perirenal edema side symptom highly suggestive acute obstruction well visualize MRU CT . Yet CT gain wide acceptance : CT widely available , accurate rapid image modality evaluation acute flank pain stone disease . MRU acceptable substitute case use radiation desire special patient population i.e . child , young adult pregnant patient . Another limitation MRU slight underestimation size ureteral stone compare CT IVU . Also , accord publish result , small ureteral stone occasionally miss chronic obstruction , especially secondary sign acute obstruction absent raise suspicion stone disease . Additionally MRU insensitive detection small calyceal stone therefore reliably evaluate actual stone disease-burden calyceal system , yet small stone rarely clinical importance . A comprehensive MRU protocol facilitate evaluation renal parenchyma , UUT , surround structure need renal vasculature . This `` one-stop evaluation '' approach fully applicable MRU additionally free radiation . Additionally MR superior CT provide good tissue contrast resolution great sensitivity contrast enhancement . Therefore MRU become secondary investigation choice US pediatric UUT imaging . The European Society Paediatric Radiology uroradiology task force ESUR paediatric work group recommend always consider MRU , available , secondary investigation US applicable situation , main principle avoid CT whenever possible . The accepted major indication CTU child severe urinary tract trauma , complicated/equivocal urolithiasis ( high level US+KUB conclusive expect therapeutic impact ) . The MRU protocol include always Both T2 T1 breath-hold sequence coronal orientation minimum . Nevertheless universally accept consensus protocol . As safe method investigator believe MRU protocol duplicate CTU protocol comparison , comprehensive protocol multiple acquisition probably beneficial .</detailed_description>
