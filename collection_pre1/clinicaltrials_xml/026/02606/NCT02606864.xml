	<criteria>Study participant reproductive potential must agree utilize two reliable acceptable method contraception simultaneously sexually active . One method must include barrier method . Subjects reproductive potential include : vasectomized male nonvasectomized male document azospermia prior screening , well females surgically sterilize bilateral tubal ligation undergone hysterectomy . Women menopausal also consider reproductive potential menses &gt; 12 month prior screen support prescreening follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 mIU/ml available . Examples reliable acceptable method birth control include , limited : diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide oral contraception condom use male partner . This apply sign inform consent 12 week last dose study medication . Male/female subject diagnose chronic Chagas ' disease : Previous diagnosis acute chronic Chagas ' disease health clinic prior screen study . The diagnosis chronic Chagas ' disease may make clinical finding , support antibody titer available . If know history acute disease , preferable documentation parasite blood smear available Age : 18 45 year ( inclusive ) first screen visit Body mass index ( BMI ) : above/equal 18 below/equal 29.9 kg / m² Incompletely cure preexisting disease ( except chronic Chagas ) assume absorption , distribution , metabolism , elimination effect study drug normal Acute Chagas'disease ( During acute phase , parasite blood smear may see microscope . Different antibody present , depend course disease ) Known hypersensitivity study drug ( active substance excipients preparation ) Unstable uncontrolled medical condition hypertension diabetes , decompensated heart failure , gastrointestinal ( GI ) condition would interfere absorption study drug ( e.g . GI ulceration , peptic ulceration , GI bleeding , gastroesophageal reflux , GI disease affect gastroesophageal junction ) , condition could potentially impact drug metabolism elimination ( renal , hepatic know hepatic biliary abnormality ) , clinically relevant active infection opinion investigator within 4 week screen visit , e.g . clinically relevant history presence significant respiratory ( e.g . interstitial lung disease ) , hematological , lymphatic , neurological , cardiovascular , psychiatric , musculoskeletal , genitourinary , immunological , metabolic ( e.g . diabetes ) , dermatological connective tissue disease Use systemic topical medicine substance oppose study objective might influence within 4 week first study drug administration , e.g . investigational drug , drug alter GI motility and/or gastric pH ( e.g . antacid , anticholinergic , parasympatholytics ) , drug know induce liver enzyme ( e.g . dexamethasone , barbiturate , St. John 's Wort [ hypericum perforatum ] ) , drug know inhibit liver enzyme ( e.g . ketoconazole , macrolides ) Clinically relevant finding ECG second thirddegree atrioventricular block , prolongation QRS complex 120 msec QTinterval 450 msec use Bazett 's Formula ( QTcB ) Fridericia 's Formula ( QTcF ) . ( clinically stable subject Chagas ' related heart disease pacemaker place &gt; 1 year evaluate cardiologist ≤6 month first dose study drug exclude . ) Systolic blood pressure 100 140 mmHg ( rest supine position minimum 3 min ) Diastolic blood pressure 50 90 mmHg ( rest supine position minimum 3 min ) Pulse rate 45 95 beat / min ( rest supine position minimum 3 min ) Findings would exclude subject physician 's judgment e.g . enlarge liver , irregular heartbeat , undiagnosed acute illness , melanoma</criteria>
