	<brief_summary>Background Aims : The `` 5:2 diet '' , form intermittent energy restriction , popularize Europe USA . The rationale behind approach two day diet potentially achievable , yet long enough reduce overall weekly energy intake . However , specific approach lack evidence . Therefore , keen investigate effectiveness form intermittent energy restriction compare control intervention ( provide dietary exercise advice ) , overweight , Chinese subject , intervention period 12 week . Design Methods : This randomize controlled trial , 15 subject arm , intervention period 12 week . Subjects randomize treatment group take three packet meal replacement product ( Optifast® ) per day two consecutive fasting day , take healthy balance diet meet estimate energy requirement remain five day . Subjects randomize control group give general diet advice allow eat ad libitum throughout study period . Measurements laboratory test do baseline , 4 week 12 week . Adherence dietary intervention assess 4 week 12 week use 7-day food diary . Significance : This first study look Asian population serve pilot towards large randomize trial . If approach find safe , effective easy adhere compare traditional continuous energy restriction , valuable option treatment obesity , become increase problem globally include Singapore .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . STUDY DESIGN This single centre , randomize control trial ( RCT ) , compare intervention question ( Intermittent Energy Restriction ( IER ) , `` 5:2 diet '' , treatment : 2 consecutive day fast ( use meal replacement , Optifast® ) per week ) control `` advice '' , 15 participant arm , adult overweight , Chinese sample , intervention period 12 week . Each potential participant subject pre-study assessment trial 2 consecutive fasting day Optifast® per intervention . Potential participant formally enrol study successfully tolerate 2 consecutive fasting day contraindication participation . The actual study period 12 week , consist 4 study visit 3 telephone call study visit . This study design control arm ( randomisation ) would provide conclusive evidence significant difference two group end study , difference likely attribute intervention ( IER , `` 5:2 diet '' , treatment ) . 2 . METHODS AND ASSESSMENTS 2.1 . Randomisation Blinding Eligible subject randomise two group : intervention group control group . This achieve use online randomisation plan generator ( www.randomization.com ) , plan generate Clinical Research Unit Khoo Teck Puat Hospital ( KTPH ) . Assignment contain within opaque seal envelope , open presence investigator subject . With regard blind , personnel perform laboratory measurement blind group allocation subject . The rest study personnel , include research nurse take anthropometric measurement , blind . 2.2 . Contraception Pregnancy Testing Females childbearing age include trial discourage get pregnant study period , contraception strictly enforce . However , participant find pregnant might pregnant course study , withdrawn study view nutritional demand pregnancy . 2.3 . Study Visits Procedures 1 . Pre-study trial procedure Interested participant assess suitability study include physical psychological health , motivation lose weight . Those continue eligible give trial 2 consecutive fasting day Optifast® per intervention study . Those successfully complete trial still express interest study formally recruit study , first study visit arrange . 2 . Week 0 : Study Visit 1 Measurements ( height , weight , waist circumference , hip circumference , % body fat bio-electrical impedance analysis , blood pressure ) laboratory test ( Fasting Lipids , Fasting Glucose , Fasting Insulin , Liver panel , Full Blood Count , B-hydroxybutyrate ) do visit . Quality Of Life ( QOL ) assess use RAND Short Form ( SF ) -36 health survey visit . 3 . Week 4 : Study Visit 2 Measurements ( height , weight , waist circumference , hip circumference , % body fat bio-electrical impedance analysis , blood pressure ) laboratory test ( Fasting Lipids , Fasting Glucose , Fasting Insulin , Liver panel , Full Blood Count , B-hydroxybutyrate ) do visit . Adherence dietary intervention assess base 7-day food diary do prior study visit . 4 . Week 8 : Study Visit 3 Only measurement ( height , weight , waist circumference , hip circumference , % body fat bio-electrical impedance analysis , blood pressure ) do visit . 5 . Weeks 2 , 6 10 : Telephone Call Subjects contact via telephone reinforce compliance study protocol ask adverse effect call . 6 . Week 12 : Final Study Visit Measurements ( height , weight , waist circumference , hip circumference , % body fat bio-electrical impedance analysis , blood pressure ) laboratory test ( Fasting Lipids , Fasting Glucose , Fasting Insulin , Liver panel , Full Blood Count , B-hydroxybutyrate ) do visit . Adherence dietary intervention assess base 7-day food diary do prior study visit . QOL assess use RAND Short Form-36 health survey . 7 . Discontinuation Visit Procedures Participants may withdraw voluntarily participation study time . If occurs , reason withdraw document participant offer obesity treatment option Health For Life Centre ( HFLC ) , KTPH . Subjects accept treatment option manage accordingly like usual patient treat HFLC , KTPH trial procedure subject . However , subject longer wish embark weight loss journey , advise continue schedule evaluation per protocol far possible facilitate intention treat analysis .</detailed_description>
