	<brief_summary>Once admit , woman transcervical balloon catheter insert induction approach participation study . If agree take part study ( tape tape ) randomize study . After balloon catheter insert , balloon fill approximately 50-60 mL normal saline , normal procedure . Study relate : If randomize `` No Taping '' foley position comfortable place tension .

	<detailed_description>Once admit , woman schedule induction 's physician order balloon catheter , transcervical balloon catheter inserted-this normal care . Patients place dorsal lithotomy position delivery bed . The cervix examine digitally ( standard care ) . The balloon catheter insert feel pass cervix balloon internal o . The balloon fill approximately 50-60 mL normal saline . This procedure standard care . Randomization : 63 card prepare read `` tape tension '' 63 prepare read `` No tape/No Tension '' . These card seal opaque envelope keep PI 's office . After consent obtain PI notify seal envelope open patient staff notify . If randomize `` No tension '' catheter position comfortable place tension ( currently standard SSM - Saint Mary 's Hospital ) . For `` Tension '' arm ( research relate ) , slight tension place catheter , tap patient 's inner thigh . The tension assess retaped need every 30 minute research and/or nursing staff . Only slight tension apply catheter assign tension group . The catheter tap inner thigh `` sag '' catheter urethra tape . There method device `` measure '' tension place catheter , patient move leg lessen increase tension , know factor . As part induction process , patient start infusion oxytocin , practice SSMHC , unless reason use oxytocin nonreassuring fetal heart trace . In situation physician 's choice use induction . Oxytocin initiate 2 milliunits/minute increase 1-2 milliunits/minute approximately every 20 minute maximum 6 milliunits/minute Foley place . After expulsion balloon , resident attend physician perform cervical examination document time cervical examination , oxytocin titrate achieve acceptable contraction rate without tachysystole -this standard care . The patient 's labor delivery manage accord routine obstetric institutional protocol . All patient continuous fetal heart rate uterine activity monitoring . Chart review perform maternal infant medical record admission discharge .</detailed_description>
