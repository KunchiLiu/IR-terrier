	<brief_summary>Thirty six patient need therapeutic extraction maxillary first premolars subsequent retraction maxillary canine divide randomly two group : piezocision group ER : yttrium aluminum garnet ( YAG ) laser group . In group , piezocision hard laser-assisted flapless corticotomy randomly assign one side maxillary arch first premolar region , side serve control . Canine retraction initiate completion level alignment phase via close nickel-titanium coil spring apply 150 g force per side , solder trans-palatal arch use anchor unit . Pre- post distalization dental cast evaluate study rate canine distalization , canine rotation anchorage loss follow-up period Class I canine relationship achieve . The level pain discomfort self-reported use questionnaire visual analog scale administer four assessment time first month minimally invasive procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Minimally Invasive Surgical Technique Accelerating Orthodontic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One main issue orthodontics prolong treatment time , lead patient , especially adult , avoid treatment seek alternative option implant veneer less optimal result . Therefore , search method decrease treatment duration main challenge orthodontic research . Decreased duration therapy seem relate well patient compliance , also reduce treatment -related root resorption , good periodontal health low risk caries white spot . Adjunct proper selection bracket , wire , biomechanic system , force level , anchorage system , array novel technique introduce accelerate orthodontic tooth movement . These technique briefly categorized surgical non-surgical . However The surgical approach clinically use test known prediction stable result . The invasiveness surgical procedure , require full mucoperiosteal flap , might drawback widespread acceptance among orthodontists patient . Therefore , conservative flapless corticotomy technique recently propose . Although various technique flapless corticotomy report successful practice , scientific evidence effectiveness far limited case series handful clinical trial , generally small group . Therefore control prospective study need study effectiveness flapless corticotomy accelerate orthodontic tooth movement .</detailed_description>
