	<brief_summary>Esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) one cancer rise incidence United States , estimate 17,000 new case diagnosed 2012 . Most patient esophageal cancer present tumor amenable surgery treat chemotherapy radiation . The common bothersome symptom esophageal cancer dysphagia ( difficulty swallow ) . Chemotherapy radiation effective shrinking tumor allow patient EAC swallow easily ; however usually take 1-2 month swallow improve treatment . Another method shrink esophageal tumor allow well swallow endoscopic spray cryotherapy ( freeze tumor inside esophagus aid endoscope ) ; cryotherapy well establish method treat cancerous pre-cancerous esophageal disease . This particularly attractive treatment option , patient esophageal cancer usually undergo endoscopy several occasion start treatment order biopsy evaluate tumor . The goal study evaluate effectiveness cryotherapy treat EAC related dysphagia patient get ready start chemotherapy radiation . In order investigator plan invite patient already undergo endoscopy pre-chemotherapy evaluation know EAC . Patients would undergo cryotherapy diagnostic portion endoscopy complete . After cryotherapy patient contact phone order evaluate change symptom , 2 4 week cryotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endoscopic spray cryotherapy ( EC ) novel modality destruction tissue gastrointestinal tract . EC involve endoscopic application cryogen [ liquid nitrogen ( LN ) ] , destroy tissue rapid freeze slow thawing . Immediate effect tissue freeze include failure cellular metabolism , membrane damage local ischemia . Delayed effect may include apoptosis cancer cell immune mediate tumor destruction . EC use treatment mucosal EAC palliation malignant dysphagia since 2007 multiple tertiary center , include Washington University St Louis , positive result . EC attractive modality palliation malignant dysphagia EAC due fact newly diagnose patient undergo upper endoscopy ( EGD ) endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) part initial staging ; thus EC could deliver time stag endoscopy , without burden patient additional procedure . However , prospective study efficacy EC short term palliation malignant dysphagia EAC perform . Thus , goal pilot study evaluate effectiveness EC short term palliation malignant dysphagia patient unresectable EAC .</detailed_description>
