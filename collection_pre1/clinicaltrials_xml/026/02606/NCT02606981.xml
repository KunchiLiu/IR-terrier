	<brief_summary>Municipal water network within industrialized country typically rely centralize treatment manage pip water quality . Optimal water quality tap , however , require well-maintained piped distribution network , performs best pip system fully pressurize . In low-income city Dhaka , water distribution network inadequately maintain typically supply intermittent service ; , vulnerable recontamination negative pressure event . Among population access type improve water source urban setting ( e.g . share tap ) , unknown consistent treatment provide chlorinate water point collection would significant health benefit . Furthermore , almost previous study water treatment intervention low-income country unblinded self-reported diarrhea main outcome , cast doubt report impact water disinfection diarrhea due entirely social desirability bias . Stanford University collaboration icddr , b conduct randomize evaluation ass impact access automatically chlorinated water water quality child health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators conduct blind cluster randomize control trial evaluate health economic impact access automatically chlorinated water . The unit randomization share water point typically serve 20-200 household . Shared water point connect hold tank compatible water treatment technology , serve 4 household least one child five , identify . Households access eligible water point primary drinking water source enrol installation chlorine device , baseline survey conduct water quality , diarrhea prevalence , health care expenditures . Following baseline , household randomly assign control treatment group . The chlorination device instal treatment group water point , doser contain vitamin C ( chlorine ) , instal control group . The free chlorine dose target &lt; 1ppm preserve blinding . All household survey every 2-3 month total follow period 14-16 month ( 5-7 survey round , budget permitting ) . Objectives : 1 . To evaluate impact automate chlorination system microbial store drinking water quality , residual chlorine , user satisfaction , user perception water taste smell , under-five child diarrhea ( longitudinal prevalence ) compare control group . 2 . Compare marginal additional cost ( per person serve ) instal maintain automate chlorination system integrate current water supply infrastructure low-income area Dhaka . 3 . Assess impact automate chlorination system hospital visit health care expenditures . 4 . To measure secondary outcome impact automate chlorination system include under-five child weight-for-age ( WAZ ) , under-five height-for-age ( HAZ ) , well level C-reactive protein immunoglobin G serum sample collect child five ( objective indicator infection , repeat diarrheal episode ) . Analysis : The primary analysis intent-to-treat ( investigator analyze difference outcomes treatment control group , group define random allocation ) . Investigators also conduct secondary analysis compare outcome intervention control , intervention group define household free chlorine residual detect store drinking water ( treat treat analysis ) .</detailed_description>
