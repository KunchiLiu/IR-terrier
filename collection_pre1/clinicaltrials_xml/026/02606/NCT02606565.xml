	<brief_summary>Background : Nearly yearly 3.3 million neonatal death occur low middle income country . Infections , include affect umbilical cord ( omphalitis ) significant factor approximately third death . In fact , odds all-cause mortality 46 % high among infant umbilical cord infection without infection . Five large randomize controlled trial Asia Sub-Saharan Africa examine effect multiple application ( least 7 day ) 4 % chlorhexidine ( CHX ) umbilical cord omphalitis neonatal death . These study show consitent positive effect multiple application omphalitis neonatal mortality . Whereas mount evidence effect 7 day chlorhexidine application , data Africa one study Asia examines effect single application CHX soon possible birth . In single Asian study , CHX lead reduction risk mild-moderate omphalitis neonatal death . It important , African set explore effect single application , programmatically much simpler implement daily application 7 day . Therefore , investigator ' study compare umbilical cord cleanse single application 4 % chlorhexidine birth dry cord care community facility birth omphalitis severe illness neonatal period . Methods : The chlorhexidine study community base , individually randomise control trial conduct 4,760 mother-infant pair Uganda . The primary outcome severe illness umbilical cord infection ( omphalitis ) . Severe illness define illness associate least one follow danger sign observe study research assistant : inability drink breastfeed ( history ) convulsion , lethargy unconsciousness , vomit feed , and/or result hospitalization and/or result death . Discussion : This study provide novel evidence , Sub-Saharan African set effect umbilical cord cleanse single application 4 % chlorhexidine birth community facility birth .</brief_summary>
