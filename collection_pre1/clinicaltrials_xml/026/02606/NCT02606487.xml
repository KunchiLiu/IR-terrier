	<brief_summary>The investigator aim ass whether pulmonary MRI ( hyperpolarised 129Xe ventilation image [ Xe-MRI ] ) detect change ventilation defect patient CF treatment pulmonary exacerbation . The investigator determine whether change see use pulmonary Xe-MRI associate change pulmonary function ( spirometry , lung volume , lung clearance index [ LCI ] ) patient CF pulmonary exacerbation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) one common genetic disease affect child young adult [ 1 ] . Lung disease primary cause morbidity mortality patient sensitive marker lung disease CF important direct therapy patient . LCI , measure multiple breath washout ( MBW ) , show sensitive traditional pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) assess treatment effect novel therapy CF patient [ 2,3 ] . However , LCI provide information regard spatial distribution ventilation inhomogeneity within lung improvement mucus plug poorly ventilate region paradoxically worsen LCI [ 4,5 ] . Thus image technique capture regional change distribution ventilation might well suit LCI detect treatment effect could also help good define utility LCI clinical tool . Xe-MRI safe , non-ionizing modality imaging lung , provide accurate spatial representation ventilation inhomogeneity [ 6 ] . Xe-MRI show effective imaging adult patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) CF [ 6 ] however , publish study use Xe-MRI child . The hypothesis study Xe-MRI LCI provide complimentary information quantify ventilation inhomogeneity CF lung disease Xe-MRI able define patient LCI fail capture positive effect treatment . The ultimate goal develop sensitive tool longitudinal monitoring direct clinical care CF patient future . To accomplish , investigator compare ability Xe-MRI LCI detect change ventilation inhomogeneity patient CF treatment pulmonary exacerbation , common pulmonary complication CF .</detailed_description>
