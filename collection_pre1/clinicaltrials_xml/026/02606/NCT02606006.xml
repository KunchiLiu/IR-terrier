	<brief_summary>Thousands canine use therapy health care center throughout United States part volunteer therapy team , yet little known outcome provide team . Although many study publish , use randomize , control format identify whether canine therapy impact mechanisms impact may occur . The purpose study use randomize , control setup canine animal-assisted therapy ( AAT ) patient undergoing inpatient physical therapy stroke , Parkinson 's disease , generalize weakness deconditioning determine whether use AAT produce desirable outcome , increase motivation , patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inpatient Physical Activity Function Through Enhanced Participation Levels Animal-Assisted Therapy Programs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many medical care facility United States employ therapy dog Animal Assisted Interventions ( AAI ) , categorize either Animal Assisted Activities ( AAA ) Animal Assisted Therapy ( AAT ) . AAA program casual typically goal-oriented , instead tend focus human-animal engagement . AAT program formal intervention target specific therapeutic goal use defined therapy session physical , psychological , occupational , speech therapist . AAT program Physical Therapists focus patient motor deficit , hospitalize due stroke ( 14.5-16.1 % lifetime incidence ) , Parkinson 's ( 1.3-2 % lifetime incidence ) , neurological injuries/disorders . In last decade , popularity AAT program hospital significantly increase , tremendous growth number study assess whether use canine AAA AAT positive medical impact patient . Currently , majority study focus AAA program , possibly AAT program require formally trained therapist animal , program consistency , strict program structure . Unfortunately , study suggest use AAT improve patient outcomes , many poorly design , poorly describe , include randomize , control trial ( RCT ) . The exist RCT AAT study focus depression , schizophrenia , psychiatric disorder suggest improvement depression , anxiety , self-esteem , social outcome , enjoyment/pleasure . No RCT study look AAT physical therapy setting . However , non-controlled , non-randomized study suggest AAT part physical therapy may improve patient physical outcome ( walk speed , number step , gait , etc . ) , possibly impact patient motivation participation physical therapy activity . The Aurora Sinai Medical Center ( ASMC ) currently utilize AAA AAT program . Most patient involve AAT program ASMC undergo intensive inpatient physical therapy due stroke , Parkinson 's disease , diseases cause generalize weakness deconditioning , inpatient receive daily physical therapy occasional opportunity include AAT therapy session . Previous study suggest patient interaction therapy dog intrinsically reward , suggest use AAT program may increase patient motivation participate thus improve physical index . However , yet objectively analyze . Hypothesis : Canine AAT inpatient physical therapy improve physical activity function enhance level participation physical therapy session . Specific Aim 1 : To evaluate whether patient participation increase physical therapy use canine AAT . Physical activity function impact patient 's level participation , influenced multiple sub-factors . Participation measure multiple way , include subjectively patient , subjectively observer ( physical therapist ) , objectively activity output . The level participation may may correlate patient 's self-perceived motivation . Specific Aim 2 . To determine whether use canine AAT increase patient enjoyment motivation physical therapy . Many people perceive interaction animal intrinsically motivate enjoyable . Consistent , canine AAT improve patient motivation participate physical therapy . However , neither enjoyment motivation study physical therapy rehabilitation inpatient , test RCT setting . Specific Aim 3 : To assess whether patient perception care improve use canine AAT physical therapy . Because presence therapy canine may improve mood , motivation , and/or patient/caregiver communication , hypothesize use canine AAT inpatient physical therapy improve patient perception caregiver , care , hospital . Innovation Impact While AAT program currently use throughout United States inpatient rehabilitation program , unknown whether program impact patient physical activity function . This study elucidate whether program provide benefit patient medical institution , thereby provide medical provider data necessary choose effective impactful care patient .</detailed_description>
