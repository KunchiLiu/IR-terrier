	<brief_title>Effects Functional Electrical Stimulation Cycling Versus Cycling Only Walking Quality Life MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) rehabilitation tool stimulate nerve via electrical current , cause muscle contract . When FES appled leg muscle stationary cycling leg move fix rhythmical pattern . Previous study demonstrate FES cycle safe effective exercise individual recover spinal cord injury stroke , applied tool progressive disorder , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The aim study assess immediate short-term effect 8-week training program comparing FES low extremity cycle cycle without FES . Twenty volunteer MS participate . They randomly assigned training group . This study examine effect train quality life , endurance , walk speed , step quality . Participants sign inform consent complete questionnaire include medical history demographic data . Before training , immediately train finish one month training , self-report questionnaire , time walking test complete . During walk test , step quality speed measure sensor worn belt</detailed_description>
