	<brief_summary>Primary progressive aphasia ( PPA ) neurodegenerative disease affect first foremost language ability . Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) slowly progressive decline single domain cognition ( e.g . language ) attributable motor sensory loss , without impediment social occupational function . MCI early sign neurodegenerative disease , due normal age . When language prominent affect domain MCI , person may later meet criterion PPA may progress clinical syndrome Alzheimer 's dementia . Spelling , naming , work memory ( e.g . repetition ) among language ability affect early course PPA language-centered MCI , different variant distinct deficit domain . This research project investigate behavioral neuromodulatory effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) language therapy PPA participant time . Anodal tDCS target leave inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) administer combination language therapy expect beneficial compare language therapy alone . It 1 ) improve language performance decrease rate decline , 2 ) better-sustained effect 2 week 2 month post-treatment , 3 ) produce generalization untrained language item cognitive function . Resting-state fMRI , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , volumetric data also collect investigate change functional brain connectivity associate tDCS individual PPA . A well understanding therapeutic neuromodulatory mechanism tDCS adjunct language therapy PPA may significant impact development effective therapy PPA MCI , may offer insight way impede neurodegeneration may improve patient ' quality life , well extend ability work manage affair .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Evaluation Tasks Language Tasks : Participants administer baseline language cognitive task , include 1 following , depend residual language cognitive skill : ) write dictation b ) oral spell c ) oral write naming picture ) word-picture match f ) write oral picture description g ) digit span h ) spatial span ) verbal learn j ) grammatical sentence production k ) oral word repetition l ) sentence comprehension Quality Life questionnaire : Participants administer standardized non-standardized quality-of-life questionnaire , , follow-up interval experimental period . The purpose questionnaire ass whether proposed intervention affect participant ' well-being general quality life . B . Spoken Written Word Production Therapy Interventions Individuals PPA receive speak write word production intervention tailor degree deficit . Two intervention ( basic advance ) implement , treat main lexical retrieval deficit PPA , oral write modality . The goal combine intervention promote interaction phonological orthographic representation process remediation lexical retrieval deficit prominent PPA subtypes . C. Assessment Language Therapy Tasks : Follow-up assessment probe set train phoneme-grapheme correspondence , word , stimulus ( e.g . sentence ) identify whether patient retain knowledge train item . Differences baseline measure pre- post-therapy accuracy phoneme-grapheme correspondence patient evaluate use follow : percentage total number point correct , arithmetic difference percentage score , permutation test ( Pearson 's chi-square test ; Fisher 's exact test ) . C. tDCS Methods : Participants take part 10-15 consecutive training session ( 3-5 per week ) , separate 2 month . Anodal tDCS typically show up-regulate neuronal excitability produce enhancement behavioral performance . A Soterix-CT device deliver current intensity 1-2mA ( estimate current density 0.04 mA/cm2 ; estimate total charge 0.048C/cm2 ) maximum 20 minute tDCS group maximum 30 second Sham group . For intervention ( tDCS Sham ) electrical current increase ramp-like fashion onset stimulation elicit transient tingle sensation scalp usually disappear seconds.. D. Imaging Methods : Imaging perform begin enrollment , 12-to-15-day tDCS treatment , follow-up interval 8 time point per individual 3T Philips system , consist resting-state fMRI ( rsfMRI ) , MPRAGE , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . Each scan session last approximately 1 hour . E. Statistical Analyses : In within-subject crossover protocol , participant administer three experimental condition : Control ( natural progression ) , IFG tDCS+language ( henceforth abbr . tDCS treatment ) ( word production ) sham tDCS+language ( henceforth abbr . sham treatment ) . To achieve accurate estimate degeneration rate decline participant particular stage disease progression , participant first enrol control condition ( natural progression ) , first 12 week receive therapy . Then participant receive either tDCS treatment follow sham , vice versa . All analysis , behavioral imaging , oversight study statistician . F. Study duration number study visit require research participant . Before intervention , participant enrol control condition 12 week therapy provide enable u assess personal decline rate . After period randomly assign either sham tDCS experimental condition . After 1-3 week tDCS application ( 3-5 session week , 10-15 session per stimulation site ) interval approximately 2 month implement two tDCS condition within-subject cross-over design . Participants followed-up 2-week 2-month follow-up interval . G. Blinding , include justification blind blind trial , applicable . Participants blind application anodal sham tDCS . To achieve blinding , participant fit tDCS electrode place left inferior frontal gyrus . The Soterix-CT device use double-blinding purpose . H. Justification participant receive routine care current therapy stop Participation study disrupt current care therapy . I. Justification inclusion placebo non-treatment group All participants undergo active sham condition , thus serve control . J . Definition treatment failure participant removal criterion Participants remove study unable comply task instruction tolerate tDCS procedure . K. Description happen participant receive therapy study end participant 's participation study end prematurely When study end participant continue receive management neurologist usual . If patient 's participation study end prematurely s/he still receive care . In sum , termination study termination participation affect regular therapy may receive . L. Qualification investigator : The PI co-investigators extensive research clinical experience study task : behavioral language therapy ( include spelling , name , repetition therapy . The investigator arelady publish tDCS study behavioral result improvement spell ability ( Tsapkini et al. , 2014 ) .</detailed_description>
