	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine feasibility tolerability regimen accelerate ( hypofractionated ) Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( AIMRT ) whole breast part breast preservation . In addition , investigator want prospectively collect blood specimen : assess TGF-Î² polymorphism identify potential carrier high risk post-treatment fibrosis ; generate blood specimen repository future study relevant polymorphism . The study investigator also want prospectively follow treat woman yearly assess long-term radiation sequela current regimen use LENT/SOMA score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accelerated Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( AIMRT ) Breast After Segmental Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite level I evidence comparable efficacy mastectomy , breast conserving therapy ( BCT ) remain underutilized United States . In 1990 , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Consensus Development Conference conclude BCT appropriate method treatment majority woman early stage I II breast cancer . However , subsequently translate moderate increase utilization BCT , shift 34 % 60 % stage I breast cancer 19 % 39 % stage II breast cancer . There appear multiple cause underutilization . The demand standard radiation schedule probably play main role . Generally , post-lumpectomy radiation therapy consist 4 5 week whole breast radiation total dose 45 50 Gy 23-25 fraction , usually follow boost 10 16 Gy 5-8 fraction tumor bed area . The total length treatment 5-7 week , commonly six week . Practically , woman choose BCT automatically commit regimen approximately six week daily radiation visit ( Monday Friday ) complete local management breast cancer . For many woman , concern commitment likely influence choice mastectomy instead breast preservation since 40-60 % woman meet criterion BCT actually undergo procedure . In addition possible bias primary health care provider affect choice , know distance RT treatment facility also play important role woman 's choice mastectomy instead BCT . Unfortunately , 15-30 % patient actually select BCT , particularly old patient 2 co-morbid condition , receive postoperative RT . These fact warrant critical assessment standard radiation therapy clinical setting . The actual standard approach post-segmental mastectomy adjuvant radiation institution consist surgical excision follow 6 week breast irradiation total 30 fraction 2 Gy , 23 ( 46 Gy ) whole breast 7 original tumor bed ( 14 Gy ) . Instead , woman study receive 15 large radiation fraction ( 2.7 Gy ) entire breast concomitant boost tumor bed ( 2.7 Gy + .5 Gy , total 3.2 Gy per fraction ) . All woman treat prone best apply IMRT technique avoid rest body . Treatment few fraction short duration time offer several advantage , provide effective conventional treatment regimen without added morbidity . The potential advantage include : 1 ) less time away home , family job ; 2 ) less cost associate travel time away work ; 3 ) ease demand radiation treatment resource produce saving health-care system . Moreover , treatment prone assure minimal dose radiation deliver lung , heart controlateral breast . Patients complete breast surgical procedure prior accrual protocol order establish eligibility criterion . All patient treat prone 2.7 Gy/fraction deliver 15 fraction 3-week period total dose 40.5 Gy . All patient follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month treatment course , yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
