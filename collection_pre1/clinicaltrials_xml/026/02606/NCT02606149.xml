	<brief_summary>Patients metastatic cancer substantial symptom burden may receive aggressive care end life . There evidence use chemotherapy near end life relate likelihood provide benefit overuse aggressive anticancer therapy near end life may result toxicity clinical benefit . Moreover , propose new line treatment successive therapeutic failure may way avoid discussion prognosis advance care planning . It propose system provide overly aggressive care near end life would one less 10 % patient receive chemotherapy last 14 day life . Presently first consultation patient oncologist rule France first `` Plan Cancer '' `` Dispositif d'annonce '' ( announcement planning ) . Oncologists suppose explain diagnosis cancer present treatment plan . In routine practice metastatic non curable cancer patient , chemotherapy present leading therapy side effect explain . The use chemotherapy associate worsen two major competitive life-threatening condition cancer patient : cachexia thrombo-embolic event . Nevertheless risk worsen condition hardly explain routine practice . This study propose examine monocentric interventional prospective randomize trial , impact particular way oncologist present chemotherapy diagnosis stage easiness timely chemotherapy interruption end life . The main objective determine whether explanation potential role anticancer chemotherapy worsen life-threatening condition impact proportion patient receive chemotherapy last 30 day life compare usual presentation . Secondary objective determine impact communication strategy overall survival indicator aggressiveness care palliative care resource use . The hypothesis intervention allow 15 % patient receive anticancer therapy last 30 day life , compare 30 % control group . The investigator expect intervention evaluate study reduce rate patient receive chemotherapy last 30 day life hopefully improve quality end life care . A secondary objective overall survival study therefore verify intervention arm associate poor overall survival . But probably investigator expect patient intervention arm improve overall survival mainly link decrease harm due chemotherapy give near end life well palliative care . In effect hypothesis show life-threatening risk associate chemotherapy thus reduce patient importance treatment leave room improve palliative care show notably earlier frequent referral palliative care specialist . If trial positive , prove capital role patient-doctor communication cancer care difference communication strategy could improve end life care maybe even survival . The impact oncology community would major since intervention could easily transpose practice additional cost . It would also emphasize importance communication skill human relationship technical field medical oncology .</brief_summary>
