	<brief_title>Extracorporeal Elimination Cytokines Following Abdominal-thoracic Esophagectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radical esophagectomy combine extensive lymphadenectomy esophageal cancer one invasive surgical procedure . Even progress make surgical technique postoperative management rate short- long term complication remain high . The surgical trauma invariably cause liberation activation inflammatory mediator danger associate molecular pattern , turn result pronounce systemic inflammatory reaction , lead multiorgan dysfunction include adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) many patient . The subsequent counter regulation immune system induce immune paralysis , follow infectious complication increase probability severe sepsis . Moreover , severe systemic inflammation cause capillary leakage , result impaired wound healing endanger anastomosis . Therefore , seem early effective measure excessive production mediator cytokine indicate without impairment innate adaptive immune response would expect administration e.g . steroid . Instead , removal excessive amount circulate cytokine might desirable method show effectivity therapy septic shock past . The aim study demonstrate effectiveness extracorporeal cytokine removal dampen systemic inflammatory response follow abdominal-thoracic esophagectomy .</detailed_description>
