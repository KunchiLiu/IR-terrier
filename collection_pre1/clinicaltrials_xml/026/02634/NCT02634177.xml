	<brief_summary>In randomized clinical trial , subject assign either assay-guided treatment condition ( AGT ) treatment-as-usual condition ( TAU ) . All subject provide DNA sample Screening Visit Genecept Assay ™ . In AGT condition , assay result provide treat investigator , use result guide antidepressant pharmacotherapy . In TAU condition , investigator treat subject without knowledge pharmacogenetic testing result . Assay result subject provide investigator Week 8 visit procedure complete . Raters primary endpoint assessment subject remain blinded treatment assignment .</brief_summary>
