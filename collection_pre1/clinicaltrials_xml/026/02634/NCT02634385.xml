	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy ( LPN ) often reserve patient small peripheral tumour , hand experience surgeon since demand high degree endoscopic skill . Renal vessel clamp vascular control require step standard LPN . However , creates time limit step surgeon induce renal injury via warm ischemia reperfusion injury . This novel approach substantially reduce renal injury LPN via superselective embolization level II renal artery pre-operatively . This technique facilitate performance clamp-less , zero-ischemia LPN , significantly simplify procedure remove time threshold within perform tumor excision . The preliminary result promise ; however , need corroboration result , addition randomize controlled trial comparing modify , zero ischemia technique standard LPN .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zero Ischemia Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The potential utility zero ischemia , laparoscopic , partial nephrectomy portends significant implication surgeon patient . Firstly , technical difficulty partial nephrectomy reduce achievable level owe mainly removal time limit surgical resection . With blood flow halt downstream tissue contain renal neoplasm preoperative embolization , resection make tumor without clamp main renal artery . This minimize ischemic time non-neoplastic renal tissue , allow renal protective effect . Without need clamping , overall surgical operative time drastically reduce . With excision make ischemic tissue , intra-operative bleeding ease achieve . More surgeon ultimately attempt LPN remove single limit surgical factor , warm ischemic time .</detailed_description>
