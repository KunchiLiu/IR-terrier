	<brief_title>Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Patients With Critical Limb Ischaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The circulation blood around body dependent effective pump heart . Patients arterial insufficiency know poor circulation lower legs foot lead various complication swell painful leg reduce heal injury . Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) define narrow artery reduce blood flow . It commonly due atherosclerosis , association heart disease , stroke , diabetes . Its incidence estimate 7-14 % general population , increase age 20 % over-seventies . It associate effect mobility , skin condition quality life . Symptoms include pain legs walking ( intermittent claudication ) , pain rest ( particularly night ) , gangrene , limb loss . Management PAD base encouraging exercise , modification risk factor smoke , high blood pressure , high cholesterol diabetes . In patient PAD , exercise tolerance often limited . Severe symptoms disease treat via balloon angioplasty , stenting surgical bypass , procedure risk . There also remain percentage patient suitable revascularisation , option amputation available . Some trial show increase blood flow legs time use medical device ( intermittent pneumatic compression , muscle stimulators ) , addition maximal medical surgical therapy , increase claudication distance , absolute walk distance , decrease rest pain , reduce amputation rate . In investigator unit become apparent increase number medical device available circulatory support , either inpatient , out-patient , member general public . The support evidence variable scientific clinical content relevance , require clinical trial evaluate . Revitive activates pump action leg muscle provide electrical muscle stimulation cause foot muscle contraction relaxation squeeze blood back towards heart , improve circulation . The investigator wish evaluate whether NMES use device beneficial effect patient critical limb ischaemia .</detailed_description>
