	<detailed_description>Arterial hypertension ( AH ) important clinical social economic problem , relate increase cardiovascular risk . AH associate cardiovascular hemodynamic alteration , include leave ventricular diastolic dysfunction ( LVddf ) . In consequence increase blood pressure , effectiveness LV blood pump decrease symptom heart failure ( HF ) , even preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) , may occur . At early stage , patient ' complaint specific difficult clinical interpretation . As consequence , subject frequently remain undiagnosed . Thus , identification noninvasive marker related progression asymptomatic AH LVddf/HFpEF would beneficial . Another issue diagnostic difficulty patient LVddf HFpEF stem limit possibility assess hemodynamic response exercise . Thus , need detail method cardiovascular monitoring exercise testing . The investigator hypothesize new noninvasive hemodynamic parameter , characterize leave ventricular ( LV ) function arterial stiffness , may help predict risk cardiovascular event future occurrence LVddf/HFpEF . Moreover , investigator assume cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) , complete new method noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring ( impedance cardiography applanation tonometry ) , would provide additional value assessment cardiovascular hemodynamic response exercise . Aims : 1 . The identification new marker cardiovascular risk patient arterial hypertension.. 2 . The identification new marker progression normal leave ventricular diastolic function leave ventricular diastolic dysfunction . 3 . The identification new noninvasive marker progression symptomatic heart failure . 4 . The evaluation feasibility usefulness new method noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring ( impedance cardiography applanation tonometry ) assessment cardiovascular hemodynamic response exercise . 5 . Multivariate assessment cardiovascular response control exercise , take account leave ventricular diastolic function symptom heart failure . 6 . The relation laboratory marker leave ventricular remodel rest exercise ( noninvasive ) hemodynamics . The study perform prospective observational design . No le 120 hypertensive subject enrol . After recruitment follow assessment perform : - anamnesis physical examination anthropometrics ( include body composition analysis use bioimpedance method ) ; - electrocardiogram ; - echocardiography ( rest ) , include assessment leave ventricular systolic ( 2-D left ventricular ejection fraction , longitudinal strain ) diastolic function ( include tissue Doppler imaging ) ; - impedance cardiography ( rest ) ; - Applanation tonometry ( rest ) ; - 24-h Holter-ekg ( include heart rate variability analysis ) ; - 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ; - flow-mediated dilation brachial artery ( FMD ) ; - 6-minute walking test ( 6-MWT ) ; - Cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) , support hemodynamic monitoring impedance cardiography applanation tonometry ; - Quality life assessment ( SF 36 questionnaire ) ; - Laboratory test ( include creatinine , urea , uric acid , lipid , glucose , microalbuminuria , N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide , galectin-3 , copeptin , soluble ST2 , Growth differentiation factor 15 ( GDF-15 ) , human tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases 1 ( TIMP-1 ) , metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP-2 ) , metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) , syndecan-1 ) . After 12 month ( first control visit ) 24 month ( second control visit ) echocardiography clinical assessment ( HF symptom ) perform identify : 1/ patient new onset LVDdf ( among group N ) ; 2/ patient new onset HF ( among group D ) Morover , follow-up min 48 month concern cardiovascular event perform ( define )</detailed_description>
