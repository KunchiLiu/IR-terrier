	<brief_title>Riociguat Versus Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty Non-operable Chronic thromboEmbolic Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , riociguat drug approve Europe US treatment non-operable CTEPH . However , medical therapy riociguat address obstructive lesion . In sense , another treatment option , balloon pulmonary angioplasty ( BPA ) , begin recently gain widespread interest development several center . This procedure use standard balloon angioplasty technique dilate select pulmonary artery . The main aim reopen vessel occlude webs band . Several team , mainly Japan , report experience BPA treatment non-operable CTEPH demonstrate impressive decrease pulmonary vascular resistance improvement functional status exercise capacity acceptable procedure-related risk . Although BPA never prospectively evaluate , lead CTEPH center worldwide currently add BPA therapeutic option . However , randomize control trial compare safety efficacy medical therapy riociguat versus pulmonary balloon angioplasty perform far . Therefore , respective place medical treatment BPA management inoperable patient CTEPH need evaluate .</detailed_description>

The diagnosis CTEPH must establish base 2 3 follow method study entry : ventilationperfusion scan , pulmonary angiography , spiralCT scan . The diagnosis inoperability must establish base spiralCT scan and/or pulmonary angiography study entry . Unspecific treatment may also use treatment pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) oral anticoagulant , diuretic , digitalis , calcium channel blocker oxygen supplementation permit . However treatment anticoagulant must start least 3 month Visit 1 . Specific PH treatment ( bosentan , ambrisentan , macitentan , sildenafil , tadalafil , epoprostenol , treprostinil , iloprost ) permit Visit 1 . Patients fulfill criterion supplemental longterm oxygen therapy ( PaO2 &lt; 55 mmHg rest ) need supply sufficiently study entry . The amount supplemental oxygen delivery method need stable least one month Visit 1 . Rightheart catheterization result definite diagnosis PH must older 6 week Visit 1 ( consider baseline value ) , must measure least 3 month full anticoagulation , must measure participate center standardize condition . Women without childbearing potential define postmenopausal woman age 55 year old , woman bilateral tubal ligation , woman bilateral ovariectomy , woman hysterectomy included study . Women childbearing potential include study serological pregnancy test negative combination condom safe highly effective contraception method use . Patients able understand follow instruction able participate study entire period . Patients must give write informed consent participate study receive adequate previous information prior studyspecific procedure . General noninclusion criterion : Participation another clinical trial precede 3 month . Pregnant woman , breast feeding woman , woman childbearing potential use combination condom safe highly effective contraception method Patients medical disorder , condition , history would impair patient 's ability participate complete study opinion investigator . Patients underlie medical disorder anticipate life expectancy 2 year ( eg active cancer disease localize and/or metastasize tumor mass ) . Patients history severe allergiclike reaction intravascular administration iodinate contrast medium Significant obstructive restrictive lung disease ( forced expiratory volume &lt; 60 % predict and/or total lung capacity &lt; 70 % predict ) . Severe hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh C ) Left heart failure ejection fraction le 40 % Severe proven suspect coronary artery disease ( symptomatic patient Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Classification class 24 , and/or require nitrate , and/or myocardial infarction within last 3 month Visit 1 ) . Severe renal insufficiency ( glomerular filtration rate ≤ 30mL/min eg calculate base Cockcroft formula ) . Noninclusion criterion related treatment riociguat : Patients hypersensitivity riociguat excipients . Treatment : PDE5 Inhibitors ( eg Sildenafil Tadalafil ) NO donor ( eg Nitrates ) Strong multi pathway cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Pglycoprotein ( Pgp ) / breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) inhibitor azole antimycotic ( e.g . ketoconazole , itraconazole ) HIV protease inhibitor ( e.g . ritonavir ) Systolic blood pressure &lt; 95mmHg Patients history lifethreatening hemoptysis ( &gt; 100 mL 24 h ) previously undergone bronchial arterial embolization hemoptysis Noninclusion criterion related BPA : Patients could remain supine position least 120 min reason .
