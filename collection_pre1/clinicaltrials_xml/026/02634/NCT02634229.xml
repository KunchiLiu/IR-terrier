	<brief_summary>Monogenic diabetes account 1-2 % diabetes case , although often misdiagnosed either type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes . Knowledge genetic etiology diabetes enable appropriate treatment , good prediction disease progression , screen family member genetic counseling . These monogenic diabetes result gene mutation reduce beta-cell function . To date , 20 gene involve insulin-secretion pathway hav identify ; correspond broad two main clinical condition [ neonatal diabetes mellitus ( NDM ) Maturity-Onset Diabetes Young ( MODY ) ] . However , still remain subtypes monogenic diabetes unelucidated . The investigator project focus family clinical familial history highly suggest MODY diabetes without genetic etiology . The investigator objective set collection family least three family member present MODY diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There several monogenic disorder pancreatic beta-cell function , characterize various degree chronic hyperglycemia . They usually diagnose early life , neonates infancy , childhood even young adult . These disease comprise broad spectrum diabetic phenotype include neonatal diabetes mellitus ( NDM ) , non auto-immune diabetes infancy , dominantly inherit form early-onset diabetes [ also name Maturity-Onset Diabetes Young ( MODY ) ] rare diabetes-associated syndrome . So far , causal mutation 20 gene highly express pancreatic beta-cells identify NDM MODY . These discovery demonstrate several aetiological mechanism beta-cell dysfunction involve distinct subtypes monogenic diabetes , include reduce beta-cell number development ( mutation PDX1 , PTF1A , HNF1B ) , reduce glucose sense metabolism ( mutation GCK , INS , HNF1A , HNF4A ) , failure membrane depolarization ( mutation KCNJ11 , ABCC8 ) increase destruction beta-cell ( mutation INS , EIF2AK3 , WFS1 ) , result inadequate insulin secretion despite chronic hyperglycemia . Additional unknown MODY locus may responsible 20-30 % early-onset diabetes case dominant pattern inheritance , proportion 50 % NDM/MDI patient still unelucidated , suggest defect pathways insulin-secreting beta-cell responsible monogenic diabetes . The investigator project collect 15 MODY-X family . This collection allow search novel gene involve MODY diabetes . The establishment cohort base recruitment family MODY-X probands analyze Department Genetics ( Pitie-Salpetriere hospital ) . This laboratory perform genetic test MODY . To select family eligible project , investigator apply follow criterion : ( ) probands negative GCK/MODY2 , HNF1A/MODY3 gene HNF4A/MODY1 ; ( ii ) dominant inheritance diabetes ( three consecutive affect generation , two generation least 2 diabetic patient generation ) ; ( iii ) Diagnosis diabetes age 40 year least 3 diabetic family member ; ( iv ) negative test anti-GAD IA2-antibodies ; ( v ) body mass index &lt; 30 kg/m2 ( avoid inclusion patient insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes ) . The investigator collect clinical information select case family interest accord standardize questionnaire . DNA sample collect diabetic family member healthy relative .
