	<brief_summary>Lamivudine ( 3TC ) nucleoside analogue indicate combination antiretroviral agent treatment human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection adult child . Documented literature elucidate simultaneous administration multiple sorbitol-containing product could increase potential significant interaction may contribute low 3TC exposure . In study several sorbitol dos ( 3.2 gram ( g ) , 10.2 g , 13.4 g solution ) administer lamivudine investigate dose dependency mimic situation multiple sorbitol-containing antiretroviral medication may co-administered lamivudine . It open label , randomize , 4-way crossover ( William 's design method ) design single centre . Randomized participant receive single dose four treatment wash period minimum 7 day .</brief_summary>
