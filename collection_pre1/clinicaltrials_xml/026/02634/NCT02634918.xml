	<brief_summary>Hemophilia bleed disorder ( deficiency blood clot factor/ protein ) result bleed joint muscle . As patient continue bleed joint develop progressive joint damage lead joint contracture , disability day miss work school result chronic debilitating pain compromise quality life . Current therapy administration miss protein factor concentrate schedule basis prevent bleed joint refer prophylaxis . This factor concentrate expensive ~ $ 3,000 - 6,000 per infusion/ week child weigh 20 kg translate $ 77,000 /yr life . This regimen show effective prevent joint bleeds time unclear base adequate evidence . Currently joint damage diagnose use MRI expensive require sedation child &lt; 6 yrs age . Therefore need user friendly tool ultrasound monitor development joint disease tailor treatment base individual child 's need . This would also enable differentiate joint bleed soft tissue bleed present similarly duration treatment tend longer joint bleed . Acharya et al previously show ultrasound comparable MRI diagnosis hemophilic joint disease hemophilia patient age 6 year . However , diagnostic finding child &lt; 18 year hemophilia ultrasound well define ( 1 ) . The hemophilic synovium repeat joint bleeds reveals development new vessel fragile contribute recurrent joint bleeds . Acharya et al previously show angiogenesis , process new vessel formation active hemophilic synovium angiogenic marker significantly elevate hemophilic patient joint disease compare without ( 2 ) . Since ultrasound detect new vessel change hemophilic synovium hemophilia patient joint disease hemophilia patient joint disease demonstrate elevate marker new vessel formation investigator would like determine whether radiological finding hemophilic joint disease correlate serological angiogenic marker . This may enable development biomarkers hemophilic joint disease . Findings study enable development ultrasound user friendly tool hemophilia clinic order understand whether every pain swell joint actually joint bleed soft tissue bleed monitor joint change institute augment schedule factor infusion ( prophylaxis ) . This also result significant improvement quality life tailor prophylaxis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Hemophilic joint disease secondary recurrent hemarthroses one disabling costly complication hemophilia . Prior widespread use prophylactic factor concentrate , child United States severe hemophilia A B ( X-linked recessive disorder &lt; 1 % factor VIII/IX ( FVIII/FIX ) activity ) experience average 30-35 hemarthroses per year report FVIII deficiency ( 3,4 ) . Clinical sub clinical hemarthroses childhood result synovitis ( hypertrophied synovium characterize villous formation , markedly increase vascularity chronic inflammatory cell ( 5 ) eventually lead pannus formation destructive arthritis ( 6 , 7 ) . At time , synovial bleeding may relate clot factor deficiency also pre-existing vascular damage inflammation , difficult control clinically . Use factor concentrate prophylaxis result hemophilia patient experience few joint bleeds , less rapid deterioration joint function few day lose school work . However , may complicate unpredictable development inhibitor ( high-affinity , polyclonal , function-neutralizing antibody direct FVIII/FIX ) , incidence 25 % 6 % respectively ( 8 ) . These individual limit treatment option treat product less efficacious treat joint bleed along potential deleterious side effect thrombogenecity ( 9 ) thus favor joint disease development . Primary prophylaxis ( infusion FVIII concentrate ( 25 - 40 u/kg thrice weekly FIX concentrate - 80-100u/kg twice week start age 1-2 yr ) onset joint bleeds use Sweden since 1960s keep trough level factor VIII/FIX &gt; 1 % , convert severe hemophilia patient ( FVIII/FIX activity &lt; 1 % ) milder form ( FVIII/FIX &gt; 5 % ) ( 10 ) . This strategy expensive ( ~ $ 77,760/year 20 kg child base use 3000 6,000 u/kg/yr recombinant factor VIII ) , may require use venous access device young child , complicate severe infection , bleed thrombosis ( 11 ) . Secondary prophylaxis hand , involve use FVIII/FIX concentrate `` target joint '' ( least four bleeds occur single joint previous six month ) identify may limit bleed subsequent joint damage . However , progression exist joint disease continue unclear whether secondary prophylaxis actually prevent joint deterioration ( 12 ) . Furthermore , study compare primary secondary prophylaxis relation cost-effectiveness long-term joint morbidity suggest primary prophylaxis improve long-term joint outcome twice expensive ( 13 ) . For reason , optimum age , subject population , time prophylaxis highly debate . Finally , therapeutic option individual fail use prophylaxis ( inhibitor patient ) refuse prophylaxis include isotopic ( IS ) surgical synovectomy . Isotopic synovectomy involve intraarticular injection 32P- colloid intent scar synovium lead subsequent reduction hemarthroses ( 14 ) , procedure recommend patient chronic synovitis ongoing hemarthroses . Again , time strategy relation onset synovitis remain unclear . Hence , prophylaxis start early ( occurrence joint bleeds ) subject population optimize , strategy detect monitor synovitis joint arthropathy urgently need prophylaxis synovectomy time base evidence reap optimum benefit . Furthermore , hemophilic child complain joint pain , clinical examination sometimes , may clearly define whether symptom relate joint bleed , synovitis surround soft tissue bleeds . Studies animal suggest cartilage damage occur concurrently synovial damage ( 15 ) contribute joint arthropathy . Therefore , seem determination synovial cartilage change would imperative may help guide prophylaxis . Traditionally , hemophilic arthropathy diagnose clinical examination plain radiographs joint , together tend underestimate extent joint destruction ( 16 ) . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) estimate degree bony damage associate hemophilic joint disease ( 14 , 17 -19 ) . The investigator previously show utility ultrasound-power Doppler sonography ( USG-PDS ) detect synovitis associate hemophilic joint disease compare MRI ( 1 ) . The need sedation child high cost ( $ 2500 MRI sedation versus $ 600 USG- PDS - sedation institution ) override utility tool repeat study may require close surveillance joint disease progression . Visualization cartilage clinically relevant benefit prophylaxis synovectomy realize minimal damage cartilage . Furthermore , scatter evidence suggest isotopic synovectomy joint affect bony arthropathy lead progression arthropathy lead cripple arthritis . The pathogenesis HJD well define . Neoangiogenesis critical factor process , tumor growth inflammatory arthritis ( 20 ) . Increased vascularity neoangiogenesis implicate progression musculoskeletal disorder tumor growth . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , principal signal molecule angiogenesis , induce hypoxia certain cytokine interaction receptor , VEGFR1 VEGFR2 ( 21 -23 ) . The synovitic pannus joint disease share histologic similarity hemophilic joint disease ( HJD ) enhance oxygen demand show evidence de novo blood vessel formation , include endothelialization synovium ( 24 ) . Further , VEGF expression serum correlate disease activity rheumatoid arthritis ( 25 ) . Endothelialization may occur result mature endothelial cell migration recruitment bone marrow ( BM ) -derived endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) hematopoietic progenitor cell ( HPCs ) peripheral circulation ( 26 ) . Importantly , proliferate synovium secrete chemocytokines , VEGF , might promote recruitment endothelial cell ( ECs ) sit active angiogenesis ( 25 ) . Co-localization hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 ( HIF-1 α ) transcription factor involve induction VEGF produce response hypoxia within joint VEGF emphasize role hypoxia up-regulation angiogenesis rheumatoid joint disease ( 27 ) . The investigator previously observe 4-fold elevation proangiogenic factor ( vascular endothelial growth factor-A [ VEGF-A ] , stromal cell-derived factor-1 , matrix metalloprotease-9 ) proangiogenic macrophage/monocyte cell ( VEGF+/CD68+ VEGFR1+/CD11b + ) synovium peripheral blood hemophilic joint disease ( HJD ) subject along significantly increase number VEGFR2+/AC133 + endothelial progenitor cell CD34+/ VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cell . Sera HJD subject induce angiogenic response endothelial cell abrogate block VEGF , whereas peripheral blood mononuclear cell HJD subject stimulate synovial cell proliferation , block humanize anti-VEGF antibody ( bevacizumab ) . Human synovial cell , incubate HJD serum , could elicit up-regulation HIF-1α mRNA HIF-1α expression synovium HJD subject , implicate hypoxia neoangiogenesis process . The investigator result provide evidence local systemic angiogenic response hemophilic subject recurrent hemarthroses suggest potential develop surrogate biologic marker identify onset progression hemophilic synovitis ( 2 ) . Therefore , evidence increase synovial vascularity USG-PDS elevate angiogenic marker suggestive increase vascularity hemophilic joint disease subject provide compelling opportunity develop surrogate biological marker hemophilic joint disease . This would also aid tailor strategy prophylaxis synovectomy individual patient .</detailed_description>
