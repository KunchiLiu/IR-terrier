	<brief_summary>The investigator propose randomize non-blinded comparison dorsal vs. ventral approach buccal mucosa graft urethroplasty bulbar urethra . Buccal mucosa graft common method repair strictured urethra . Current evidence suggest two approach placement graft equally successful correct stricture two approach similar risk complication . The investigator propose randomly assign appropriately select patient either dorsally- ventrally-placed graft . No additional procedure beyond normal care protocol require patient . Success assess via objective subjective method ; complication tally standardized fashion . Outcomes measured two year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Dorsal Versus Ventral Buccal Mucosa Graft Onlay Bulbar Urethroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Screening eligibility ; Enrollment/baseline : Patients refer UCSF urology clinic urethroplasty . Participants commonly come clinic already image stricture , complete appropriate PROMs , uroflowmetry post-void residual urine volume measurement . The patient usually leave initial clinic visit schedule surgery . Thus , screen enrollment do initial clinic visit . If patient agrees enroll sign consent form , randomize . 2 . Randomization : The PI contact research assistant email telephone communicate random identification number subject receive random assignment ventral dorsal graft . This usually occur initial clinic visit certainly surgery date . Patients blind assignment . Surgeons , necessity , blind well . 3 . Treatment/intervention period : Patient undergo urethroplasty use standard approach graft place ventrally dorsally , assign . Most patient go home day surgery . A catheter leave urethra 2-4 week standard approach buccal graft urethroplasties . 4 . Follow-up ( extra clinic visit , questionnaire , test beyond investigator normally patient undergo urethroplasty ) : 1 . 2-4 week : urethral catheter removal urethrogram document well-healed suture line 2 . 3 12 month post-operative clinic visit : i. cystoscopy ii . PROMs additional post-operative questionnaire iii . Uroflowmetry post-void residual urine volume c. Annual visit year 1 : The investigator typically follow patient annually end date urethroplasty . For publication purposesits set 1 year study end date investigator continue see patient outside study protocol year 1 ( participant receive care people study ) perform follow : i. Cystoscopy , indicate base abnormality ii iii ii . PROMs additional post-operative questionnaire iii . Uroflowmetry post-void residual urine volume 5 . Data Safety Monitoring Both ventral dorsal buccal mucosa graft standard care surgeon study perform least 50-100 surgery . Investigators anticipate adverse event well know literature . Urethroplasty generally low risk surgery . Still , AEs monitor surgeon communicate Dr. Jeremy Myers The University Utah , serve coordinate center study .</detailed_description>
