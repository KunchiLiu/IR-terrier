	<brief_title>Whole Blood Plasma Sample Collection Development Antipsychotic Immunoassays From Participants Taking Aripiprazole , Olanzapine , Paliperidone , Risperidone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 0 , multicenter ( one hospital work medical research study ) study include participant take aripiprazole , olanzapine , paliperidone risperidone . Participants provide blood sample use development antipsychotic immunoassay . At different time , assay development require venous , capillary , type blood sample . Overall , single study visit , minimum approximately 0.1 milliliter ( mL ) maximum approximately 15 mL blood collect source . Across study visit , maximum 450 mL blood collect participant . The frequency collection ( study visit ) depend need assay development . A particular participant may participate 1 sample collection multiple sample collection ( study visit ) . This study continue indefinite period time . The participant 's direct involvement study continue study end , participant give 450 mL blood , participant withdraws consent exclude participation medical and/or inclusion/exclusion criterion reason . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
