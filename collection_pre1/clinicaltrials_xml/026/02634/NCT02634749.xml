	<detailed_description>Introduction Evidence accumulate early feeding affect health development later life . The positive effect breast feed well know , less know different type time complementary food , i.e . food use transition breastfeed formula-feeding family food affect short long-term health . During time complementary feeding , demand energy nutrient remain high , especially second half first year life . We others show link protein intake time period later risk overweight . Earlier study implicate high protein intake infancy late dietary recommendation infant child suggest low intake , may contribute decrease prevalence obesity see country . Early introduction carbohydrate-rich complementary food also associate alteration lead later obesity insulin resistance . Finally , others show high intake polyunsaturated fatty acid low intake saturate fatty acid diet infant improve blood lipid influence track childhood . The composition complementary food important also perspective food flavour , texture presentation . Experiences flavour foetal breast feeding period prime newborn infant accept type food mother usually take , include food flavours outside normal preference infant , i.e . sweet , salty fatty . Also acceptance different texture food change infancy year . As oral motor skill infant develop , child able handle increasingly lumpy solid food . A normally develop infant period great acceptance novel food term flavour texture , usually coincide time complementary food introduce . However , window opportunity introduce new food begin close around 10-12 mo . age , child grows increasingly suspicious unfamiliar taste , i.e . food neophobia , also , solids n't introduced time , texture common food item . Studies show type number different food child accepts influence manner frequency introduce time . Numerous study show fruit vegetable important part healthy eat habit age , actual intake food item among young child low . Instead , population-based study Sweden show dietary intake child satisfactory public health perspective , intake refine sugar , fatty food salt high intake fruit vegetable low . In 2005 Nordic Council Ministers launch New Nordic Food programme . This initiative highlight health , gastronomic sustainability aspect food produce within Nordic region . Compared regular Swedish diet , Nordic diet ( ND ) stress high intake regionally produce fruit , berry , vegetable , tuber , legume , high intake whole-wheat , vegetable fat oil , fish egg , low intake sweet , dessert dairy , meat poultry product , time line current dietary recommendation . In adult , study ND show beneficial effect weight metabolic cardiovascular disease marker magnitude e.g . Mediterranean diet . We aim improve body composition , metabolic marker faecal microbiota composition young child use ND basis complementary food , emphasis regionally produce fruit , berry , vegetable , tuber legume , also increase intake fish vegetable fat oil , particularly use rapeseed oil decrease total protein intake . Effects faecal microbiota composition propose pathway link early dietary intake later metabolic outcome . Relevance The early diet longstanding effect human health . Apart breastfeed little known infant diet would confer long-term health benefit . ND several potential advantage respect , study adults show favourable effect metabolic cardiovascular disease marker mortality similar gain Mediterranean diet . The present study , use ND basis complementary food also reduce total protein intake , improve fatty acid composition expand introduction fruit vegetable diet small child first study kind add vital information search prevent obesity , dyslipidaemia , insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes , hypertension cardiovascular disease implication future national international dietary recommendation young child . Through early intervention , i.e . already complementary food introduce diet infant , believe initiate healthy food preference earliest date thus maximize long-term public health benefit healthy eat . By adopt concept ND also add gastronomical aspect development optimal complementary food well support regional food production contribute sustainable environment . Objectives The overall aim study compare effect ND portfolio intervention body composition , metabolic marker , blood pressure faecal microbiota composition conventional complementary feed 6-18 month age . More specifically , investigate : 1 . A complementary diet lower protein ( total reduction 30 % ) affect growth , body composition , i.e . reduce total body fat mass improve metabolic marker , i.e . decrease plasma ( P ) level insulin , glucose insulinlike growth factor 1 ( IGF1 ) without detrimental effect linear growth . 2 . A complementary diet base Nordic food affect growth , body composition , i.e . reduce body fat mass improve metabolic marker faecal microbiota composition , i.e . microbiota composition associate less obesity inflammation without detrimental effect linear growth . 3 . Complementary food modify fat intake , i.e . high intake LCPUFA increase intake fish substitute fat oil find regular complementary food milk fat rapeseed oil improve body composition , metabolic marker , cognitive development faecal microbiota composition without detrimental effect linear growth . 4 . A systematic introduction plant food Nordic diet wean increase acceptance new fruit vegetable diet young child . Methods Participants recruitment Healthy , full-term singleton recruit 4 month age . When parent consider appropriate introduce complementary food diet child , later 6 mo . age , child randomly allocate one two study group , i.e . Nordic diet group ( intervention , ND ) Regular diet group ( control ) . The group allocation mask participant researcher . Study product All participant provide study product free charge . In ND group specially prepared , protein-reduced , age-adjusted milk cereal drink ( MCDs ) , baby cereal baby milk , commercially available baby food glass jar ( BIG ) . The control group offer commercially available , age-adjusted MCDs , baby cereal , baby milk BIG . All product manufacture Semper AB , Sweden . Introduction complementary feed The ND group give recipes fruit vegetable puree instruction prepare recipe . The main ingredient fruit , berry vegetable grow available Nordic region accord predefined list . These taste meal give participate infant parent judge prudent start offering infant food beside breast milk formula infant deem ready parent . The control group give standard , oral write advice give well-baby clinic parent begin small taste meal . Parental support Parents child ND group give support continue follow dietary intervention social medium ( Face book ) . In forum parent discuss study dietician among , share experience . Parents also instructional video preparation certain study food recipe . Participants share experience information discretion . No data collect group , group may function way inform family group upcoming study event remind participant send e.g . questionnaire . Both intervention control group get monthly telephone call research nurse study dietician . Data collection Main data collection point baseline , i.e . child 4-6 month age , 9 , 12 18 month age . At time point participant come Paediatric Research Unit measurements sample . Procedures The baseline visit 9mo . visit take place Paediatric Research Unit Department Clinical Sciences , Paediatrics , Ume√• University Hospital ( Figure ) . At age 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 13-17 mo . research nurse dietician telephone follow-up participant check adherence , possible study relate problem , supply consumption study product symptoms registration . At 12 18 mo . participant come Paediatric Research Unit sample . Also , research nurse home visit anthropometric measurement , TBW two videotape test , i.e . food acceptance test free play test . Informed consent withdrawal A write Informed Consent subject 's parents/caregiver inclusion criterion without subject include study . The participant may withdraw study time withdraw consent , noncompliance participant experience adverse event require participant withdraw advice research physician his/her accord . If possible reason withdrawal record . Participants withdrawn replace . D. Statistical analyse ethical clearance Comparisons difference main outcome ND control group focus statistical analysis . The primary outcome analyse accord intention-to-treat principle compare two study group , per protocol analysis also do . Both parametric nonparametric test use depend distribution data . Possible effect modifier confounders include analysis need explain group difference .
