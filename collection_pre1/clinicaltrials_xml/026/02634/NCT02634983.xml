	<brief_title>QVA Mechanistic Efficacy Study ( Receptor Effects , Etc )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current physiological measure small airway dysfunction limit , subject high degree variability allow quantitative assessment global regional ventilation defect . The MRI approach represent opportunity well understand impact potent dual bronchodilator small central airway thereby increase ventilate lung volume , gas exchange , ventilation-perfusion deficits.This study investigate effect QVA149 global regional lung ventilation use MRI lung image enhance understand QVA pharmacology COPD patient .</detailed_description>
