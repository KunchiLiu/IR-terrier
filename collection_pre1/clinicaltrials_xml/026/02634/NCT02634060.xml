	<brief_title>Home basEd faecaL calProtectin Measurements Predicting Adalimumab Induction Destiny</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adalimumab ( Humira® ) , fully human monoclonal antibody TNF , give important position treatment patient inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . However , patient respond adequately relatively expensive potentially toxic therapy . Adapting standard treatment regimen individual need patient may favor short long term outcome therapy . Following daily clinical practice , patient receive standard induction therapy 160 mg adalimumab week 0 , follow 80 mg adalimumab week 2 . Starting week 4 patient receive maintenance therapy 40 mg adalimumab every week . If patient show insufficient response , dose increase 40 mg adalimumab every week . Defining predictor response ADA become major objective scientific research . One predictor response may early decrease faecal calprotectin . Faecal calprotectin protein presence stool patient correlate endoscopic disease activity . A persistently elevate faecal calprotectin start adalimumab treatment may suggest patient need high dose .
