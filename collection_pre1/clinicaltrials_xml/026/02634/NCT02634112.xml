	<brief_summary>Primary Endpoint : The main objective National Registry identify incidence analyse risk factor anastomotic leakage rectal cancer surgery From operational point view , aim Registry systematize collection information different surgical service . This Registry claim National audit function , allow thus knowledge procedure perform center could enable establishment best standard care . Secondary Endpoints : To determine real incidence anastomotic leakage accord different location technique : uniform definition anastomotic leakage . To analyze preoperative risk factor anastomotic leakage : PATIENT FACTOR . To analyse variability practice rectal anastomosis : SURGEON FACTOR . To analyse influence different stapling device rectal anastomosis : INSTRUMENTAL FACTOR To know current treatment anastomotic leakage associate morbidity mortality . To create validate anastomotic leakage predictive Score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spanish National Registry ANAstomotic Leakage CAncer REctum ( ANACARE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedures : This Registry surgical procedure perform patient undergo elective surgery rectal cancer , resect curative intent , anastomosis , without protective ileostomy . Patients include pre-operatively , website access study database . This inclusion could do day surgery . Participating site must include patient undergoing rectal cancer consecutively study duration ( approximately 1 year ) . Data collect day 30 patientÂ´s discharge . No follow-up plan , except establish clinical practice . The study aim extensive comprehensive registry patient meet inclusion criterion period one year . An estimated number center patient fixed priori ; depend dissemination Registry member Spanish Association Surgeons commitment involvement involve investigator . An estimated number center patient fixed priori ; depend dissemination Registry member Spanish Association Surgeons commitment involvement involve investigator . All Spanish surgeon , member Spanish Association Surgeons , invited participate . Minimum requirement participant establish , important commitment Registry ( quality information regular update ) . Other criterion consider selection participate site sufficient volume patient enable collection information , present high history rectal cancer surgery per year . The existence Coloproctology Unit publication area also evaluate . Data record electronic Case Report Form . It contain follow variable , others : Identification data responsible physician Administrative data procedure Patient demographic data Preoperative data Intraoperative data Postoperative data Final follow-up ( 30 day surgery ) The information collect always reflect clinical practice site , one result analyze difference practice site site .</detailed_description>
