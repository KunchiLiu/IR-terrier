	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Pre-operative Radiation Therapy Soft Tissue Sarcomas Extremity Chest-wall</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND OVERVIEW : Hypofractionation several potential advantage conventional radiation . First , biological equivalent dose tumor high hypofractionation conventional radiation . In radiation treatment repair radiation damage cancer cell ( cell survival curve region repair refer `` shoulder '' curve ) . Some cell line well repair others . Sarcoma often refer `` radioresistant '' tumor , mean sarcoma cell line large capacity radiation repair cell line . A treatment deliver high dose few fraction potentially overcome repair . There concept radiation know `` biologically equivalent dose '' ( BED ) state high dose per fraction result tumor kill low dose per fraction . For example , radiation deliver total 60 Gy three 20 Gy fraction equivalent 150 Gy 2 Gy fraction . BACKGROUND RATIONALE : It important conduct study hypofractionation decrease treatment package time cost care , also potentially improve patient convenience quality life could impact radiologic pathologic variable positive way lead tumor cell kill . This could potentially change paradigm current management STS extremity chest-wall . HYPOTHESIS : Preoperative hypofractionated radiation therapy localize soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) result local control toxicity similar conventional fractionation less cost , patient convenience decrease overall treatment time . TREATMENT : Image-guided radiation therapy mandatory . PREOPERATIVE : ( 1 ) Either 3D conformal radiotherapy intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) . ( 2 ) A prescription dose 35 Gy 5 fraction give every day least 48 hour fraction prescribe cover 95 % planning target volume . TREATMENT SCHEDULE : Treatments minimum 48-hour interfraction interval . Treatments complete 20 day maximum .</detailed_description>
