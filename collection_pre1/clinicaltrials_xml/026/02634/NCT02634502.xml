	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Combined With S-1 Pancreatic Cancer With Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Outcome Measures : To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) pancreatic cancer patient liver metastasis treat radiofrequency ablation combine S-1 . Secondary Outcome Measures : 1 . To explore correlation OS serum microRNA patient . 2 . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) correlation serum microRNA . 3 . To observe objective response rate ( ORR ) adverse effect treatment .</detailed_description>
