	<brief_summary>Elevated blood cholesterol , particularly LDL cholesterol , risk factor heart disease . Tocotrienols naturally-occurring compound food may beneficial effect blood cholesterol . Tocotrienols member vitamin E family , find barley , oat , rye , coconut oil rice bran oil , richest source tocotrienols palm oil . Certain tocotrienols show effective lowering LDL ( 'bad ' ) cholesterol , adverse effect HDL ( 'good ' ) cholesterol . The purpose study determine effect palm-oil derive tocotrienol supplement blood cholesterol , particularly LDL cholesterol , individual take statin , either elevate normal cholesterol level . Study subject consume palm-oil derive supplement tocotrienol 3 month determine effect LDL cholesterol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Supplement Derived From Palm Oil Cholesterol Levels Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both tocotrienols tocopherol , whose derivative eight different isoforms , closely relate structurally . Tocopherols generally present common vegetable oil ( i.e . soy , canola ) . However , tocotrienols concentrate cereal grain ( ie . oat , barley , rye , rice bran ) , high level find crude palm oil . The development new cholesterol-lowering agent give attention pharmaceutical company due strong relationship cholesterol atherosclerosis . Tocotrienols , especially δ- γ-tocotrienols , show effective nutritional agent treat high cholesterol recent research program . In particular , γ-tocotrienol appear inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase posttranscriptional level evidence tocopherol antagonize effect . Therefore , current study design demonstrate treatment tocotrienol-enriched fraction palm oil three month period lead significant reduction LDL cholesterol effect HDL cholesterol patient whose cholesterol level adequately control spite statin . This objective achieve utilizing simple three arm randomize placebo-controlled trial total 99 subject After acclimation step I AHA diet supplemental vitamin E diet , subject give either placebo capsule tocotrienol ( 120mg 240mg ) capsule addition statin medication</detailed_description>
