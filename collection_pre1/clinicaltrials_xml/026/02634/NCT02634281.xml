	<brief_summary>SUMMARY Rationale : Worldwide , cigarette smoking carry high mortality . Since available cessation program effective smoker , new strategy necessary tobacco control . Primary objective : To investigate whether 6-week varenicline preloading facilitates smoke reduction cessation compare standard varenicline treatment schedule . Design : Parallel group , double-blind , randomise control clinical trial . Participants : Smokers sex general population . Methods : Participants randomize two group treatment . Subjects Group A receive varenicline six week group B receive placebo 5 week varenicline 1 week . During phase , subject group ask reduce cigarette smoke 50 percent . At week 6 participant instructed stop smoking receive 12 week varenicline treatment . Visits arrange randomization , week 4 , week 6 ( Quit day ( QD ) ) week 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 QD . Measurements : These include vital sign , smoke history , spirometry , expire CO , salivary cotinine , nicotine dependence , withdrawal symptom . Primary outcome continuous abstinence 6 month . Sample size : For estimate difference quit rate 15 % 24 week ( 30 % group A vs. 15 % group B ) 121 subject per group need ( Total = 242 subject ) . Statistical analysis : T test ( rational variable ) x2 test Fisher 's exact test ( nominal variable ) use appropriate . Expected benefit : This study might contribute optimize current use varenicline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended ( 6-Week ) Varenicline Preloading : Does Facilitate Smoking Reduction Cessation ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : The study parallel group , double-blind , randomise control clinical trial . Allocation treatment make subject entered study he/she fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion ( see ) . Visits arrange inclusion , week 4 6 ( Quit day ( QD ) ) inclusion , week 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 QD . Study population : Participants eligible smoker throughout Jerusalem , want reduce stop smoking . Randomisation procedure : Subjects computer-randomised either extended varenicline preload treatment regular varenicline schedule . Both group receive identical treatment thereafter . Blinding : Due nature intervention , blind possible varenicline preload phase . During phase , study team member participant blind treatment allocation . After week 6 participant receive , active treatment . Study intervention : After enrolment subject randomize receive either varenicline preloading 6 week ( 1 mg/day week 1 ; 2 mg/day week 2-6 ) ( Group A ) placebo 5 week varenicline 1 week ( Group B ) . Then , subject group receive regular treatment varenicline 12 week accord schedule depict Table 2 . Only minimal level advice support give . However , subject receive individualize verbal instruction regard general conduct study proper use study medication . All participant ask reduce smoke 50 percent 6 week inclusion stop smoke altogether . At baseline follow data collect : 1 . Demographic assessment ( age , sex , height weight ) . Subjects weigh schedule visit scale throughout study : prior weigh , subject remove shoe excess clothes . 2 . Medical history 3 . Physical examination 4 . Vital sign ( pulse , blood-pressure ) assess standard manner . 5 . Spirometry : This carried baseline end-study use electronic spirometer technique currently perform Pulmonary Institute , Shaare Zedek Medical Center . 6 . Smoking history smoking relate information use modify Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire ( mCEQ ) . 7 . Nicotine dependence evaluation use Fagerström Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) . 8 . CO expire air . Expired carbon monoxide level measure Bedfont monitor record schedule study visit . The subject instruct inhale deeply , 15 second breath hold , produce full , slow force expiration disposable mouthpiece inflow valve monitor . Readings record part per million ( ppm ) CO ( non smoker = &lt; 8 ppm ; smoker = &gt; 10 75 ppm ) . 9 . Withdrawal symptom : Will measure use Mood Symptoms Physical Scale ( MPPS ) ( See Appendix ) . 10 . Salive Cotinine determination : This carry 3 visit namely baseline visit , week 6 end-trial . 11 . Concomitant medication : Information currently use medication collect</detailed_description>
