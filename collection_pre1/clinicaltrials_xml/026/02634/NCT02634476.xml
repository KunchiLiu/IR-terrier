	<brief_summary>It well-established many substance misusers experience impairment cognition ( think skill ) , particularly need regulate monitor behaviour ensure goal achieve . According dual-process model , addiction arises imbalance 'bottom-up ' processing i.e. , overactive automatic ( impulsive ) process drive behaviour impair 'top-down ' control process stop behaviour associate negative consequence . As result , individual becomes sensitive cue environment ( e.g. , alcohol image ) trigger addictive behaviour . Cognitive-bias modification ( CBM ) novel , computer-based training paradigm train brain pay less attention negative/harmful cue attention positive neutral cue . This approach minimize overactive 'bottom-up ' process improve 'top-down ' control process unhealthy behavior enables addict individual make good decision . Recently , CBM use addict population alter tendency approach alcohol , one German study show 4-session training programme associate high rate abstinence one-year ( Wiers et al. , 2011 ) . The current study examine whether novel computer base training programme alters cognitive bias ( tendency approach alcohol related stimulus ) alcohol-dependent inpatient , examine whether enables well decision-making generally , impact crave post-discharge abstinence rate . The study also explore whether individual difference impulsivity sensitivity reward punishment determine response training programme . This achieve use parallel-groups randomized superiority trial design involve approximately 80 patient attend inpatient withdrawal programme Victoria . The finding likely implication design delivery psychosocial intervention deliver early recovery alcohol-dependence optimise treatment effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Cognitive-bias Modification Training During Inpatient Alcohol Detoxification Reduce Relapse Rates Post-discharge ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : According dual-process model addiction ( Gullo , Loxton , &amp; Dawe , 2014 ) , addictive behaviour result imbalance strong , impulsive processing system relatively weak , reflective processing system . Due imbalance , impulsive preference reward , reflect increased sensitivity stimulus addiction ( i.e. , attentional bias ) automatic tendency engage stimuli addiction ( i.e. , approach bias ; Wiers et al. , 2007 ) . Clinical trial CBM begin emerge individual alcohol use disorder ( Fadardi &amp; Cox , 2009 ) . Wiers et al . ( 2009 ) develop alcohol approach/avoidance task ( alcohol-AAT ) , participant respond approach behaviour ( pull joystick ) avoidance behaviour ( push joystick ) picture addiction-related neutral stimulus . Following four session train task patient display well treatment outcomes one-year later ( Wiers et al. , 2011 ) . A study Eberl et al . ( 2013 ) find 12 session approach-bias modification training associate high rate abstinence one-year relative control . Underlying relationship cognitive bias addiction , within dual-process model paradigm , impulse-control process . However , relationship impulsivity cognitive bias remain unclear . Indeed , individual weak inhibition skill tend bias toward automatic information processing ( Gladwin et al. , 2011 ) impulsivity think play role degree cognitive bias influence outcome ( Peeters et al. , 2012 ) . The development understanding benefit assessment CBM treatment addiction patient . Rationale : Despite intensive psychosocial intervention , alcohol-dependent patient relapse within week day leave inpatient detoxification . The study therefore examine whether alcohol approach-bias modification training programme detox reduce crave relapse alcohol-dependent inpatient . By dampen automatic tendency approach alcohol-related stimulus , individual allow time make inform behaviour choice ( i.e. , improve decision-making ability ) . Its impact examine abstinence rate 2-weeks 3-months relative receiving sham training . The finding likely implication design delivery psychosocial intervention deliver early recovery alcohol-dependence , aim optimise treatment effectiveness . Aims : 1 . To determine 4-sessions CBM , use alcohol approach-bias modification training program , deliver inpatient withdrawal , reduce crave relapse rate drinking-related outcomes 2-weeks 3-months post-discharge . 2 . To determine CBM , use alcohol approach-bias modification training , improve decision-making four training session . 3 . To determine CBM effect ( i.e. , use alcohol approach-bias modification training ) moderate impulsivity . Hypotheses : 1 . CBM ( use alcohol approach-bias modification training ) lead significantly high rate abstinence 2-weeks 3-months large reduction day relapse , percentage heavy drinking day crave score , relative sham training . 2 . CBM ( use alcohol approach-bias modification training ) associate significantly great improvement decision-making ( Iowa Gambling Task performance ) fourth train session compare sham training . 3 . Patients great impulsivity show significantly great response CBM ( use alcohol approach-bias modification training ) . Methodology : The study parallel-groups randomized superiority trial compare CBM ( use alcohol approach-bias modification training ) versus sham training ( i.e. , control condition ) alcohol-dependent participant follow residential detoxification treatment . The primary outcome variable self-reported alcohol use ( relapse versus abstinence ) 2-weeks 3-months post discharge secondary outcome include : day relapse , percentage heavy drinking day , alcohol crave Iowa Gambling Task performance ( i.e. , decision-making ) immediately post-intervention . Assignment : Randomisation carry accord ICH Guideline independent statistician involve day-to-day conduct trial . Following baseline assessment , participant assign randomly treatment condition use 1:1 ratio randomly permute block . Participants : The target sample define alcohol-dependent patient seek treatment detoxification inpatient unit Wellington House , Box Hill , Victoria . Setting : Wellington House , inpatient detoxification service ; part Turning Point , state-wide Alcohol Drug ( AOD ) service incorporate Eastern region base service . Measures : Standard demographic questionnaire include : age , gender , history alcohol use , previous alcohol treatment , employment , income source , housing arrangement , family situation , mental health . Current medication regimen , include psychotropic medication . All benzodiazepine convert standard dose diazepam . Baseline drug use clinical measure : Alcohol/Drug use : Timeline Followback Interview ( TLFB ; Sobell &amp; Sobell , 1992 ) : measure frequency alcohol/drug use past 4 week . Baseline alcohol dependence : Severity Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire ( SADQ ; Stockwell et al , 1983 ) . General cognitive functioning : Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) : brief cognitive screening tool general cognitive functioning ( Nasreddine et al , 2005 ) . Appetitive motivational behaviour/ impulsivity : The Sensitivity Reward ( SR ) part Sensitivity Punishment Sensitivity Reward Questionnaire ( SPSRQ ; Torrubia et . al. , 2001 ) ; specifically measure appetitive motivational behaviour impulsivity . Impulsiveness , venturesomeness , empathy : The I7 Impulsiveness questionnaire ( Eysenck , Pearson , Easting &amp; Allsopp , 1985 ) 54-item measure consist three scale : impulsiveness , venturesomeness , empathy . Craving : Assessed use 100mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . The VAS provide index urge drink use two dimension ( positive negative urge ; Dawe &amp; Gray , 1995 ) . Craving : The Alcohol Craving-Short-Form-Revised ( ACQ-SF-R : Singleton , 2000 ) 12-item measure crave alcohol among alcohol user current context ( right ) . Depression anxiety : Seven depression seven anxiety item shorten Depression Anxiety Stress Scale ( DASS ; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond , 1995 ) . Decision-making : A computerised version Iowa Gambling Task ( IGT ; Bechara et al. , 2000 ) : measure decision-making condition uncertainty risk punishment . Procedures : Recruitment consent : Participants approach researcher earlier day three admission . All Participants provide Plain Language statement explain purpose study require participant . The study also explain verbally researcher . If participant choose become part study write consent form ( i.e. , Patient Information Consent Form ) complete . The researcher also seek consent contact others document relevant telephone/contact detail self-reported outcome assess 2-weeks 3-months post-discharge . Baseline , intervention post-intervention outcome assessment : Following consent take , baseline assessment complete described measure section . Participants randomise one two condition , cognitive bias train sham training . On morning day 3/4 day 6/7 ( i.e. , four consecutive day ) admission , participant undergo ABM ( intervention ) . Each training session expect last approximately 15 minute . Participants give opportunity take optional break intervention . After final ( i.e. , fourth ) training session , participant complete post training assessment ( decision-making task crave measure ) . Two-weeks 3 month post discharge researcher telephone participant use timeline follow-back instrument document alcohol consumption since discharge ask question engagement treatment since discharge . Statistical Analyses : The primary hypothesis use binary outcome variable ( abstinent versus relapse 2-weeks ) follow completion protocol ( four session ) examine use chi-square analysis . Secondary outcomes continuous variable ( i.e. , day relapse , percentage heavy drinking day , mean number standard drink , crave score , IGT score etc . ) examine use mixed effect repeat measure model ( MMRM ) include type intervention ( cognitive bias modification train versus sham training ) independent variable craving , decision-making , day relapse alcohol consumption outcome dependent variable . The third hypothesis test multiple regression model include sensitivity reward impulsivity score baseline , predictor outcome ( abstinence , day relapse etc.. ) . Power calculation base hypothesized medium effect size indicate sample size 72 participant ( 36 group ) require test study hypotheses 80 % power .</detailed_description>
