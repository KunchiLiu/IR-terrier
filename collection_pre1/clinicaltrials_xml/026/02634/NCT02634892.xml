	<detailed_description>To demonstrate efficacy pressure redistribute cool mattress overlay prevention pressure ulcer critical care unit , prospective randomize human clinical trial perform . The trial use functionally equivalent test overlay . The initial pilot clinical trial evaluate efficacy safety PRO-TECT ™ mattress overlay ICU patient already develop early pressure ulcer ( Stage 1 2 ) prevent progression . The trial perform UPMC ICUs enrol patient age 18 old Stage 1 Stage 2 sacral/coccyx pressure ulcer . The trial consist 2 arm : 1 ) current usual care ( UC ) vs. 2 ) UC + target cool overlay mattress ( TCOM ) . Exclusion criterion include anticipated ICU length stay &lt; 3 day , patient initially designate specialty overlay/bed pulmonary bariatric diagnosis , patient Stage 3 4 unstageable pressure ulcer sacrum . The UC group receive current UPMC ICU guideline-based care daily assessment sacral pressure ulcer . Nursing care guideline apply include frequent patient turning , pressure alleviation , moisture control , friction relief application . Patients group may receive specialty bed overlay mattress without cool recommend wound care specialist . The TCOM group receive UC plus overlay mattress target sacral cooling . Wound care well assessment perform daily non-wound care nurse ( ie . ICU nurse ICU care Floor nurse non-ICU care ) part regular daily assessment non-target cooling target cool patient . Wound care specialist ass wound Mon/Wed/Fri progression deterioration wound . These wound care nurse specialty train stage decubitus well recommend change care promote healing . Additionally record data part routine care patient wound . Theses type wound assessment best perform every 2-3 day order see significant change therapy data record . Data collect Monday , Wednesday Friday week include Braden score , pressure ulcer stage , heal progression ( deterioration ) measurement ( e.g. , size ) , evidence infection . Additionally , frequency patient reposition record , documentation justification provide . Other data collect include demographic , vitals , comorbidities , length time ( prior incapacitation home nursing facility , transport , emergency department , operative room ) , ventilation oxygenation requirement , ventilator day , ICU LOS , need dialysis , vasopressor , lab include nutritional lab . Data collect study endpoint discharge hospital . Final cost analysis perform compile cost-benefit arm . Accrual 6 month .</detailed_description>
