	<brief_title>EMDR v Supportive Therapy Relapse Prevention Traumatized Bipolar Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The intervention strategy available bipolar disorder essentially pharmacotherapy psychosocial intervention cognitive behavioral therapy , psychoeducation , interpersonal family therapy . However , despite everyday use clinical practice type intervention , almost 70 % patient bipolar disorder suffer affective relapse within two year . Although origin multi-causal , emerge research topic association bipolar disorder posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Data STEP-BD study show prevalence 20 % PTSD sample 3158 bipolar patient , rate almost three time high prevalence PTSD general population . This comorbidity important clinical implication traumatize bipolar patient suffer rapid cycling , suicide attempt , substance abuse , low quality life ( hypo ) manic depressive symptom bipolar patient without PTSD . The result similar population severe mental illness history trauma ( necessarily diagnosis PTSD ) . These population affective episode , psychiatric symptom , increase risk suicide , frequency risk sexual behavior , admission psychiatric hospital overall , great risk re-traumatized . The strength evidence support clinically relevant effect PTSD and/or history trauma bipolar disorder contrast surprising lack trial aim treat patient experienced traumatic event . One form treatment increasingly use PTSD therapy Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing ( EMDR ) . This integrative psychotherapeutical approach use standardized protocol element cognitive-behavioral , interpersonal , body-centered therapy conjunction dual stimulation ( e.g . horizontal eye movement side side ) . The result two independent meta-analyzes show EMDR therapy effective treatment PTSD symptom cognitive behavioral therapy . The treatment EMDR also test successfully versus exposition therapy wait list large randomize controlled trial patient psychosis PTSD . Their result show significant reduction trauma score intervention comparison wait list intervention regard safe respect exacerbation psychotic symptom . Our group carry first randomize control pilot study EMDR bipolar traumatize patient subsyndromal symptomatology . Our result show EMDR intervention reduce symptom associate trauma patient , also beneficial effect symptom subsyndromal mood . Following result study , research group develop specific comprehensive EMDR protocol bipolar patient history trauma . This protocol consist comprehensive survey traumatic event , intervention processing event accord Shapiro standard protocol 5 sub-protocols direct ( ) enhance treatment adherence , ( b ) increase insight , ( c ) treat prodromal symptom , ( ) work de-idealization manic symptom ( e ) provide mental stabilization . Aims hypothesis : The main objective study examine EMDR therapy protocol specific bipolar patient history traumatic event act mood stabilizer . This would result less affective relapse well overall cognitive function 6 month therapy group receive EMDR submit compare ST group . Other related aim project expand available option psychosocial intervention bipolar disorder , demonstrate EMDR therapy safe effective tool traumatize bipolar patient treatment EMDR lead improvement course prognosis disease . Hypotheses : 1 . The EMDR group show less affective relapse 12 24 month follow-up compare ST group . 2 . Patients EMDR group show less affective symptom compare ST group evaluation 6 , 12 24 month . 3 . Patients EMDR group show well cognition function compare ST group evaluation 6 , 12 24 month . Design : Single-blind randomized clinical trial ( 1:1 ) two parallel branch , stratify center age , sex , number previous affective episode cognitive state . The preventive effect two psychological intervention , individual EMDR therapy ST plus pharmacological treatment patient diagnose bipolar I II disorder history traumatic event , current affective phase euthymia subsyndromal symptom evaluate . The comparative clinical effect branch intervention assess five time point . There pre-intervention baseline assessment , post-intervention assessment 6 month follow-up evaluation 12 , 18 24 month . Clinical diagnostic variable : 1 . Clinical diagnosis participant employ DSM-IV-TR criterion . 2 . Clinical Severity participant assess different instrument : 1 . Bipolar Depression Rating Scale ( BDRS ) : The BDRS up-to-date appropriate tool ass depressive mixed symptom bipolar patient . Our group involve translation validation scale Spanish . 2 . Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) validate Spanish : YMRS hetero-administered scale compose 11 item aim quantify severity manic hypo manic episode . 3 . Clinical Global Impression Scale modify bipolar disorder ( CGI-BP-M ) , Spanish validation : The CGI-BP-M scale consist 3 subscales ; first two assess severity acute symptom mania depression , third evaluate longitudinal severity disease . Each subscale seven sub-categories score 1 7 rating severity disorder normal , low , mild , moderate , mark , severe severe . Other clinical variable collect via medical history patient use specific CRF study age onset disorder , number relapse , number previous episode , history number suicide attempt pharmacological variable number , type dose drug . 3 . Trauma symptom , cognitive profile overall functioning evaluate follow instrument : 1 . Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) validate Spanish . 2 . Impact Event Scale Revised ( IES-R ) . 3 . Distressing Event Questionnaire . 4 . Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire . c. Functioning Assessment Short Test ( FAST ) . d. Screen Cognitive Impairment Psychiatry ( SCIP ) validate Spanish . e. Screen social cognition , emotional intelligence : Mayer-Salovery-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test . Statistical analysis : 1 . Computation sample size The study assess relative efficacy specific EMDR intervention protocol versus Supportive Therapy ( ST ) clinical stabilization ( decrease number relapse ) traumatize bipolar patient . For reason number affective episode treatment follow 24 month use dependent variable study . The sample size computation base recent study compare CBT versus ST 24 month follow relapse bipolar patient . The calculation sample size base survival analysis use statistical package `` powerSurvEpi '' R ( http : //www.r-project.org/ ) use alpha = 0.005 instead 0.05 allow correction multiple comparison . The number patient require detect hazard ratio = 2 cox regression statistical power 80 % alpha = 0.005 n = 36 per intervention group ( two group , EMDR ST , equal total n = 72 ) . A sample size show clinically relevant difference . Assuming percentage drop-outs 10-15 % participant would necessary recruit approximately 82 patient , 41 allocate intervention arm . 2 . Analysis main variables The baseline distribution socio-demographic clinical characteristic group analyze use descriptive statistic . Continuous variable normal distribution analyze Multivariate Analysis Variance ( MANOVA ) . The main hypothesis survival time ( week ) analyze use Kaplan-Meier curve test significance test base log-rank test . The change baseline clinical variable compare baseline strategic time point trial analyze repeated measure ANOVA factor time , treatment condition interaction . The Wilcoxon test use case meet assumption normality . Between group difference main categorical clinical variable analyze use Chi-squared test . Those variable statistically significant use covariates linear logistic regression factor associate magnitude effect order determine factor well predictor performance . For analysis effect size index ( Hedges g index Pearson r index ) estimate . The late version SPSS software ( v. 18 , 20 ) use carry statistical analysis . 3 . Analysis clinical efficacy The main statistical analysis employ intention treat ( ITT ) approach provide unbiased comparison among treatment group . The `` Last Observation Carried Forward '' approach ( LOCF ) employ measure minimizing loss .</detailed_description>
