	<brief_summary>The focus project use transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) novel indication treat neuromuscular activation individual knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) exhibit neuromuscular activation deficit . The overall goal improve outcomes associate traditional therapeutic exercise ( TE ) develop enhance rehabilitation strategy , augments TE TENS ( TENS+TE ) , purpose treat underlie neuromuscular activation deficit . The investigator seek use TENS excite neural pathway immediately increase neuromuscular activation well cause sustained improvement neuromuscular activation great strength gain knee OA patient compare traditional TE . The investigator evaluate effect TENS+TE muscle strength , neuromuscular activation , gait biomechanics , physical function , physical activity , self-efficacy physical activity , self-reported quality life , disability pain . The central hypothesis enhance TENS+TE intervention lead well clinical outcome , increase physical activity , improve general health . The rationale conduct small clinical trial , demonstrate feasibility establishes preliminary effect enhance rehabilitation strategy , ultimately inform development future large clinical trial establish efficacy enhanced rehabilitation strategy knee OA . This hypothesis test two specific aim : 1 ) collect report data feasibility conduct clinical trial evaluate efficacy use TENS+TE compare sham TENS+TE TE treat patient knee OA clinical setting , 2 ) determine preliminary effect 4-week TENS+TE intervention compare sham TENS+TE , TE muscle strength , neuromuscular activation , gait biomechanics , physical function , physical activity , self-efficacy physical activity , self report quality life , disability , pain knee OA patient . Posttests 4 8-weeks follow baseline .</brief_summary>
