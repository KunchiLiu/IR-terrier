	<brief_summary>An open label , multicentre , international pilot study paritaprevir/ritonavir , ombitasvir , dasabuvir without ribavirin people recently acquire hepatitis C virus infection without HIV co-infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Recently Acquired Genotype 1 Hepatitis C With 3D Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use highly potent IFN-sparing drug combination set recently acquire genotype ( GT ) 1 HCV infection hypothesise result vast majority patient achieve SVR . In set , anticipated therapy shorten relative use establish chronic infection . A short course IFN-free strategy likely highly attractive patient clinician prove may encourage early HCV test diagnosis . In pilot study , investigator plan explore safety , efficacy feasibility IFN-sparing combination paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir , dasabuvir ribavirin 8 ( potentially 6 ) week patient document recently acquire GT 1 HCV infection .</detailed_description>
