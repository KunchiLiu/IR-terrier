	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Question : To determine effect use MIRA fall prevention Exergames improve balance old adult . Secondary Question/Objectives : 1 . What feature usual fall prevention team routines/activities need consideration successful implementation strength balance Exergame intervention ? 2 . How Exergames tailor home use old adult ? 3 . What effective outcome measurement detect meaningful change result MIRA Exergame programme ? 4 . What current challenge solution access robust data depict cost current therapy treatment compare home-based MIRA Exergame treatment ? 5 . Is possible retain participant intervention 12-week MIRA Exergame intervention respect outcomes include motivation , enjoyment usability ? 6 . What train support need require maximise use MIRA Exergame technology ? 7 . What cost MIRA Exergame intervention cost-effectiveness MIRA Exergame intervention compare usual care . 8 . What effect fall fall-related use health service 6-month follow ? STUDY DESIGN &amp; PROTOCOL Participants This project cluster RCT study test effectiveness undertake MIRA Exergames shelter home set addition usual activity . A maximum 12 shelter housing unit , 108 participant recruit participate study . These split experimental group ( 6 shelter housing unit n=54 ) control group ( 6 shelter housing unit n=54 ) . These 2 group base 2 fall prevention team Manchester second site Glasgow . Falls prevention team staff professional also recruit study ( n=20 ) either give professional insight feedback usability exergames and/or help supervise participant . Study Intervention Sheltered Housing facility recruit via Manchester Glasgow Housing Associations enable facility similar size deprivation status identify . The sheltered housing facility randomise two group : Exergame/experimental group ( n=6 shelter housing unit 9 participant recruit ) ; control group ( n=6 shelter housing unit 9 participant recruit ) . The participant control group offer Exergame intervention final 12-week measurement ethical reason . A pre-enrolment examination carry trained research physiotherapist ass person 's suitability participate Kinect exergame programme , also evaluate potential impact Exergames various aspect physical health . Their GPs also notify . The eligible participant give tailor , individualised [ i.e . frequency duration set accord participant 's baseline level ] Exergame programme incorporate normal routine plus usual fall prevention treatment ( prescribed physiotherapist ) . The control group give usual fall prevention assessment , treatment home exercise without Exergames . The Exergame intervention run 12 week test efficacy intervention . Outcome measure use 12 week include series standardise test questionnaire . Each participant aid complete measure . These assessment take place 3 time : baseline , 6 week , end 12-week period . The intervention participant offer use Exergame intervention group set and/or home set accord preference ( previously pilot small feasibility study ) . The physiotherapist physiotherapist assistant supervise monitor progress also ability see result Exergame programme ( anonymised data point gain , time use , range motion ) Falls Prevention Clinic participant consent share anonymised data . At end 12 week , focus group interview conduct assess therapist participant ' perspective regard effectiveness remote MIRA Exergame program usability .</detailed_description>
