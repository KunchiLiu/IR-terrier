	<brief_summary>Multiple study implicate vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF major causative factor human eye disease characterized neovascularization include proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) vascular permeability include diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . While strong evidence PDR outcomes markedly reduced eye treat monthly anti-VEGF therapy ( A Study Ranibizumab Injection Subjects With Clinically Significant Macular Edema ( ME ) With Center Involvement Secondary Diabetes Mellitus : RIDE/RISE ) moderately reduced eye receive fairly frequent dose 1st year treatment ( Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network protocol I ) , unknown whether early less frequent dose regimen would result similar , favorable anatomic outcome , whether favorable anatomic outcome subsequently would result favorable visual acuity outcomes . If study demonstrate intravitreous aflibercept treatment effective safe reduce onset PDR center involved- DME ( CI-DME ) eye high risk complication , new strategy prevent vision threaten complication diabetes available patient . The application intravitreous aflibercept early course disease ( i.e. , time eye baseline severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ) could help reduce future potential treatment burden patient , time result similar well long-term visual outcome , PDR DME prevent . The primary objective protocol 1 ) determine efficacy safety intravitreous aflibercept injection versus sham injection ( observation ) prevention PDR CI-DME eye high risk development complication 2 ) compare long-term visual outcome eye receive anti-VEGF therapy early course disease observe initially , treat high-risk PDR CI-DME vision loss develop . Secondary objective include : - Comparing visual acuity outcomes treatment group , proportion eye least 10 least 15 letter loss baseline , gain loss least 5 letter consecutive study visit 2- 4-year visit - Comparing optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) outcomes , mean change OCT central subfield thickness volume baseline - Comparing proportion eye least 2 3-step worsen improvement diabetic retinopathy severity level ( scale individual eye ) central reading center baseline - Comparing associate treatment follow-up exam cost treatment group - Comparing safety outcome treatment group</brief_summary>
