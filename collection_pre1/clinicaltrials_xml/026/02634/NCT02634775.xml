	<brief_summary>Children chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) suffer one devastating diseases childhood result lifelong need health care , 3 time decreased life expectancy . In addition , important comorbidities negatively impact quality life integration society , jeopardize future even potential transplantation . Retention uraemic toxin accept play major role pathogenesis comorbid condition , study child lack . Furthermore , currently good tool evaluate severity monitor adequacy treatment , result suboptimal management . The overall scientific objective four year UToPaed IWT-TBM project provide clinician new diagnostic therapeutic tool management child CKD , base improve understanding uraemic toxicity . In UToPaed ( part 1 ) , investigator associate concentration wide variety uraemic toxin different comorbidities CKD child , i.e . growth , protein-energy wasting , quality life , cardiovascular risk factor , circadian rhythm , sleep quality , psychosocial neurocognitive functioning ( i.e . cross-sectional longitudinal ) . Those toxin concentration best correlate comorbidities progress CKD representative kinetics ( UToPaed - part 2 : Kinetic analysis ) select marker . During third part UToPaed , marker , together comorbidities , track intervention , i.e . start dialysis , transplantation , change dialysis strategy . From validate kinetic model ( UToPaed - part 2 3 ) , open access user-friendly prediction simulator ( PAEDSIM ) base patient characteristic marker concentration develop optimise individualise dialysis therapy . By provide clinician advanced appropriate tool improve management child CKD , i.e . well assessment degree renal dysfunction , good determination ideal time start renal replacement therapy , accurate monitoring dialysis adequacy , investigator aim improve neurocognitive psychosocial functioning ( short term ) , growth , maturation puberty , social integration ( median term ) survival ( long term ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uraemic Toxins Chronic Kidney Disease Paediatric Patients : Interventional Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This interventional multicenter study child ( ≤ 18 year ) chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) stage 2 5D without renal replacement therapy . They follow total duration 24 month . Concentrations uraemic toxin marker different comorbidities follow intervention . Some intervention happen treatment CKD child : e.g . transplantation , start dialysis , need switch PD HD . In patient PD , different approach follow : frequent exchange overnight , PET-directed dialysis regime , adapt PD , use mix short , small volume dwells , long , high volume dwells . These different strategy far test use classic adequacy parameter urea creatinine . The intervention child , include longitudinal study , study least two different PD strategy , serve control , whereby strategy link concentration uraemic toxin marker comorbidities . In patient HD , different dialysis strategy study : conventional haemodialysis 3x/week , daily haemodialysis , haemodiafiltration 3x/week , nocturnal 8h dialysis 3x/week , optimal dialysis regime derive kinetic analysis ( UToPaed_2 ) . The intervention child , include longitudinal study , study least 2 strategy , difference plasma concentration removal rate uraemic toxin marker measure . The measured predialysis concentration , time average concentration ( TACs ) , total solute removal different strategy compare result kinetic simulation order validate calibrate kinetic model uraemic toxin marker . Based result , guidance optimal dialysis strategy child develop , child consequently treat modality 1 year , allow evaluation long term impact quality life , catch growth , study result emergence new comorbidities . The therapeutic tool comprises open access user-friendly prediction simulator , base kinetics new marker ( PAEDSIM ) simulate different dialysis strategy . With different patient characteristic uraemic toxin concentration input simulation model , program derive optimal dialysis strategy individual patient strive low predialysis concentration TACs . The clinical use finding promote organisation 'CKD Academy ' workshop prediction simulator ( PAEDSIM ) relate laboratory technique ( see utilisation strategy ) .</detailed_description>
