	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent locally require authorization ( eg , HIPAA ) obtain patient/legal representative prior performing protocolrelated procedure , include screen evaluation . 2 . Metastatic unresectable cancer express KIT document patient 's pathology report . 3 . For patient GIST , patient progress least one prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy intolerant . If document SDH deficient PDGFRAD842V GIST , prior therapy require study entry . Other patient KIT positive cancer progress least one prior therapy . 4 . Patients must least 1 lesion measurable use RECIST guideline . 5 . Females childbearing potential sexually active nonsterilized male partner must use 2 method effective contraception screening , must agree continue use precaution 60 day final dose study medication . Females childbearing potential define surgically sterile ( i.e. , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , complete hysterectomy ) postmenopausal ( defined 12 month menses without alternative medical cause ) . 6 . Nonsterilized male sexually active female partner childbearing potential must , partner , use 2 acceptable method effective contraception Day 1 60 day receipt final dose study medication . 7 . ECOG status 0 1 . 8 . Adequate organ function define : Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL . This criterion must meet without transfusion . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) case involve liver metastasis ≤ 2.5 ×ULN case Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN except case document suspect Gilbert 's disease , bilirubin must ≤ 5 × ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 g/dL 1 . Receipt anticancer therapy : Within 3 week prior first dose CDX0158 biologic treatment IV chemotherapy . Within 2 week prior first dose CDX0158 oral therapy 5.5 half life whichever longer follow palliative radiation therapy . Concurrent use hormone noncancer related condition ( e.g. , insulin diabetes hormone replacement therapy ) acceptable . 2 . Requirement chronic immunosuppressive medication include systemic corticosteroid physiologic dose ( 30 mg/day hydrocortisone equivalent ) . 3 . Known allergy past administration reaction include infusion relate reaction ( IRRs ) , anaphylactic , anaphylactoid reaction component CDX0158 formulation . 4 . History clinically significant allergic reaction atopic disease may pose increase risk severe CDX0158 IRRs . 5 . Symptomatic untreated central nervous system metastases require concurrent treatment , include limited surgery , radiation , and/or corticosteroid ; treat , patient must asymptomatic 3 month prior study entry . 6 . Other invasive malignancy within 2 year prior enrollment ( localized prostate cancer , cervical carcinoma situ , nonmelanoma skin cancer , ductal carcinoma situ breast has/have surgically cure would exclusionary ) . 7 . Unresolved toxicity prior anticancer therapy , define resolve NCI CTCAE v 4.03 &lt; Grade 2 normalized baseline , level dictate inclusion/exclusion criterion , exception alopecia . 8 . Major surgical procedure ( defined investigator ) within 30 day prior Study Day 1 incomplete recovery prior surgery . 9 . Pregnancy breast feed 10 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness would limit compliance study requirement compromise patient ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , hypertension require adjustment medication , idiopathic symptomatic hypotension , unstable angina pectoris , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia include uncontrolled atrial fibrillation , active peptic ulcer disease gastritis ongoing blood loss , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance compromise ability patient give write informed consent . 11 . Any condition , opinion investigator , would interfere evaluation study medication interpretation patient safety study result . 12 . Concurrent enrollment another clinical study , unless observational ( noninterventional ) study . 13 . Patients leave ventricular cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 50 % assessed echocardiogram MUGA scan prolong QTc interval Grade 2 high history prolong QTc interval drug .</criteria>
