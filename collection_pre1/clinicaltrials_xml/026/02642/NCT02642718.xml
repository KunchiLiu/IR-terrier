	<brief_summary>Background : Experimental model use short duration noxious stimulus lead concept pre-emptive analgesia . Ketorolac , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , show post-operative narcotic sparing effect give pre-operatively alternatively effect . This study undertaken determine whether single intravenous dose ketorolac would result decreased post-operative pain narcotic requirement . Methods : In double-blind , randomize control trial , 48 woman undergo abdominal hysterectomy study . Patients ketorolac group receive 30 mg intravenous ketorolac 30 minute surgical incision , control group receive normal saline . The post-operative analgesia perform continuous infusion tramadol 12 mg/hour possibility 10 mg bolus every 10 minute . Pain assess use Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , tramadol consumption hemodynamic parameter 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 24 hour post-operatively . We quantify time rescue analgesic ( morphine ) , adverse effect patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Damage tissue show provoke magnify reaction noxious stimulus , peripherally diminish threshold nociceptive afferent nerve terminal centrally augment excitability second-order sensory neuron spinal cord ; later result amplification extension postoperative pain surgery . Hence , much research focus procedure avoid central neuroplastic change usage preemptive analgesia . Experimental model conduct idea 'preemptive analgesia ' . The decrement afferent nociceptive input spinal cord use analgesic technique start initial painful stimulus avoids attenuate formation spinal hyperexcitabilty avoids transform process afferent input , lead less postoperative pain . Whether experimental model applicable noxious circumstance occur surgery controversial . Although preemptive analgesia different agent successful experimental animal , conclusion human study remain conflict . A diversity agent analyze conceivable preemptive analgesic effect : local anesthetic , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , paracetamol , opioids , magnesium , cytokine synthesis inhibitor , ketamine , tricyclic antidepressant . Scientific research enable understanding molecular mechanism nociception disclose considerable function cytokine prostaglandin ( PG ) . Hyperexcitability also appear peripherally nerve ending location surgical tissue damage mediate part prostaglandin . Evidence accumulate product cyclooxygenase pathway may engage elaboration central sensitization . Drugs block formation prostaglandin NSAIDs might therefore assume avoid minimize formation peripheral central hyperexcitability . Their central analgesic action effect avert spinal prostaglandin synthesis attenuate liberation neurotransmitter primary afferent terminal spinal interneurons . Sporadic study establish considerable preemptive benefit NSAIDs . As result , objective study ascertain impact NSAID , ketorolac , pain severity analgesic requirement , early postoperative period . Ketorolac nonselective NSAID block cyclooxygenase 1 ( COX-1 ) cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX-2 ) enzymes result block formation prostaglandins attenuate sensitization procedure . The antinociceptive anti-inflammatory action NSAIDs may associate suppression nitric oxide synthase activation , decrease generation proinflammatory cytokine , lipoxine activation . Consequently , multidirectional activity indicate may probability adjust nociception process employment drug perioperatively . To knowledge , prior control study determine effectiveness preoperative intravenous ketorolac compare placebo patient underwent abdominal hysterectomy . Thus , clinical trial conceive explore postoperative analgesic efficiency opioid-sparing action single dose intravenous ketorolac contrast placebo administer preoperatively .</detailed_description>
