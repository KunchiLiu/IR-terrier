	<brief_summary>This non-randomized , multicenter , single-stage phase II study mifepristone patient advance metastatic NSCLC fail two previous chemotherapy regimen . The Investigator plan enroll 18 evaluable patient Stage 1 , additionally 22 evaluable patient Stage 2 total 40 evaluable patient . Participants follow overall survival . Current salvage therapy advance NSCLC achieves median progression free survival time 10 week overall survival 10 month . The Investigator would like provide evidence mifepristone increase median progression-free survival time 15 week overall survival time 16 month .</brief_summary>
