	<detailed_description>Background : Symptoms attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) often observable preschool age associate similar behavioral , social , cognitive impairment see old child ADHD . Seventy eighty percent preschooler symptoms ADHD continue display symptom elementary school . Behavioral therapy recommend first line treatment age group . There small promising study look yoga intervention school age child ADHD , none look specifically yoga intervention preschool age child ADHD symptom ( Birdee et al , 2009 ) . Objective : To determine yoga improves hyperactive/impulsive symptom attention preschool age child `` risk '' ADHD . Study design : A randomized wait-list control trial explore whether 6 week child 's yoga improve behavioral symptom , task-related score attention , increase heart rate variability preschool age child `` risk '' diagnose ADHD . The investigator plan enroll total 30 child age 3-5 year old . `` At risk '' ADHD define four inattentive hyperactive/impulsive symptom rat parent teacher ADHD Rating Scale-IV Preschool Version . Procedures : The investigator evaluate efficacy yoga improve ADHD behavioral symptom use parent teacher rating scale ( ADHD Rating Scale-IV Preschool Version ; Strengths Difficulties Questionnaire ) , well objective measure include computer base task attention executive function ( KiTAP , Test Attentional Performance Children ) , heart rate variability ( HRV ) , physiologic measure self-regulatory capacity . HRV assess active , attention computer task ( use emWave Â® desktop device ) , well relaxed state , breathe exercise pair verbal affirmation . The protocol include baseline , post-treatment 3 month follow-up assessment . The intervention consist school home yoga session . School session hold twice week Triumph Center Early Childhood Education , local preschool associate University California , Davis . The school base yoga class lead train child yoga instructor use manualized yoga protocol 30 minute long . Home session include use child 's yoga video feature protocol practice home day child participate school . The goal daily yoga practice 6 week intervention period . Home yoga practice document daily parent complete brief online survey email . Generalization skill learn yoga session behaviorally-challenging situation specifically develop teach parent teacher `` cue '' child integrate skill learn yoga session daily routine . The goal child learn use breathe practice affirmation help regain calmness focus behavior become challenge . A questionnaire ass parent teacher perception regard use yoga child 's daily life , effect challenge behavior , satisfaction intervention . Optional focus group also do parent teacher child participate study order gather qualitative data yoga intervention . Statistical Methods Power Analysis : Outcome distribution visualize , necessary , log-transformed reduce skewness stabilize variance . For wait-list design , primary assessment treatment effect estimate compare treatment control group baseline-adjusted mean outcome first follow-up report 95 % Confidence Intervals . Between- within-group contrast involve outcomes 2nd follow-up time permit exploration treatment durability . The primary index HRV standard deviation beat-to-beat interval , time- frequency-domain index evaluate exploratory analysis . Assuming pre/post correlation 60 % , target sample size 30 subject permit estimate treatment effect margin error 0.41 standard deviation provide 80 % power ( 2-sided alpha=5 % ) detect between-group effect small 0.59 standard deviation . Gaps knowledge : The majority study yoga child ADHD conduct school age child , one complete United States . None look specifically yoga intervention ADHD symptoms preschooler . In addition , none study include physiologic measure vagal tone , show increase adult practice yoga . Physiologic measure valuable objective measure treatment response , may give evidence support role , perhaps mechanism yoga may affect change ADHD . The investigator assess heart rate variability ( HRV ) , measure beat-to-beat change heart rate , reflect activity vagus nerve , key component parasympathetic nervous system , mediate change heart rate . Reduced HRV associate increased morbidity mortality , increase HRV associate physiologic resiliency , ability self-regulate improve performance task executive function . Compared healthy control , child ADHD high mean heart rate , unmedicated child significantly decrease HRV . In adult , HRV find increase response exercise biofeedback . A study child ADHD evaluate use biofeedback use HRV coherence , synchronization heart rhythm pattern , find improve cognitive function behavior . HRV evaluate relation yoga training young child ADHD symptom . Innovation : This project novel subject population , preschooler , teach yoga school , use manualized treatment , objective measure wait-list randomize control methodology . While many study exercise , yoga meditation child , many lack sophisticated methodology guide clinical practice . The propose method highly innovative , critical move field forward provide direction clinician , parent teacher need research guide clinical decision-making .</detailed_description>
