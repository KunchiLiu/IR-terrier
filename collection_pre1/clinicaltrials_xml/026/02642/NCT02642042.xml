	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well trametinib docetaxel work treat patient stage IV KRAS mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer cancer come back . Trametinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving trametinib docetaxel may work good treat non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib Docetaxel Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV KRAS Mutation Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate ( confirm unconfirmed ) trametinib plus docetaxel entire study population Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient follow one two prior systemic therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate trametinib plus docetaxel consistent promise activity measure response rate G12C KRAS mutation positive NSCLC patient follow one two prior systemic therapy . II . To assess response rate combination non-G12C KRAS mutation positive NSCLC patient . III . To assess progression-free survival within G12C non-G12C KRAS positive subgroup entire study population . IV . To evaluate toxicity regimen . V. To assess overall survival within G12C positive patient , non-G12C positive patient , entire study population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate presence comutations p53 LKB1 . II . To bank specimen future research . OUTLINE : Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) day 1-21 . Patients also receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
