	<brief_title>Pertuzumab First Line Treatment HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer commonest cancer woman worldwide estimate 1.4 million new diagnosis 2008 1.6 million case estimated 2015 . In 2008 breast cancer responsible approximately 23 % new cancer diagnose woman . It also commonest cause cancer death woman worldwide : 2008 458,500 woman die breast cancer , 538,500 projected 2015 . In developed country breast cancer ( 94 % -95 % patient EU USA ) diagnose tumour confine breast - without locoregional lymph node involvement . At early breast cancer ( EBC ) stage disease normally operable treat curatively . Metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) less common occur 5 % -6 % newly diagnose case . Despite advance treatment EBC approximately 30 % woman develop local recurrence metastasis . In USA Europe patient MBC survive mean 24 month 5 year survival rate 18 % -23 % . Between 18 % 20 % breast cancer show HER2 amplification and/or HER2 receptor overexpression . Such patient poor prognosis conventional treatment . The HER2 receptor protein belong epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) family . The HER family consist four structurally similar receptor - HER1/EGFR , HER2 , HER3 , HER4 - regulate cell process differentiation , invasion , proliferation , neoangiogenesis , survival metastatic potential . In breast cancer HER2 positivity associate aggressive tumour , high relapse rate , low shorter treatment response increase mortality . Systemic treatment option MBC include chemotherapy along hormonal targeted approach . Tumor property patient-specific factor determine choice treatment . In HER2-positive MBC trastuzumab many year reference first-line treatment . Treatment-naive HER2-positive patient MBC treat trastuzumab taxane chemotherapy show significantly longer median time progression ( TTP ) , high objective response rate ( ORR ) long median response median survival patient treat chemotherapy alone . Although trastuzumab prove effective combination chemotherapy first-line treatment patient HER2-positive MBC , approximately 50 % patient experience disease progression within one year start treatment . Mean survival HER2-positive patient pivotal study trastuzumab combination taxane 24.8 31.2 month . Therefore high medical need novel HER2-targeted therapy improve survival outcome patient HER2-positive MBC . An essential step activate downstream signal pathway homo heterodimerisation HER2 receptor member HER family . Inhibition HER2 dimerisation inhibits downstream signal pathway mediate cancer cell proliferation survival . Pertuzumab , humanise monoclonal antibody , first HER2 dimerisation inhibitor ( HDI ) . It bind specifically extracellular dimerisation domain HER2 receptor , thereby inhibit ligand-dependent heterodimerisation receptor HER family member . Pertuzumab actually inhibit ligand-activated intracellular signal transduction two main signal pathways - mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway phosphoinositide-3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway . Inhibition signal pathway arrest cell growth cause apoptosis . Pertuzumab also mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . Pertuzumab trastuzumab bind different epitope HER2 receptor . Their mechanisms action complement ensure comprehensive blockade HER2-dependent signalling pathway . The phase III , multicentre , randomise , double-blind placebo-controlled clinical CLEOPATRA trial compare pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel v placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel 808 patient HER2-positive metastatic , locally recurrentor inoperable breast cancer . Patients may receive one hormonal treatment metastatic breast cancer randomization . Patients may receive adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy without trastuzumab randomization , interval least 12 month completion adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy diagnosis metastatic breast cancer . Randomised patient stratify previous treatment status ( without previous adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy ) geographic location ( Europe , North America , South America Asia ) . Pertuzumab give intravenously start dose 840 mg follow dose 420 mg every 3 week . Trastuzumab give intravenously start dose 8 mg/kg follow dose 6 mg/kg every 3 week . Patients treat pertuzumab plus trastuzumab disease progression , withdrawal consent participation development uncontrollable toxicity . Docetaxel give intravenous infusion start dose 75 mg/m² every 3 week least 6 cycle . If start dose well-tolerated , dose docetaxel could increase 100 mg/m² investigator 's discretion . The primary study endpoint progression-free survival ( PFS ) , assess independent review facility ( IRF ) define interval randomisation disease progression death ( cause ) , death occur within 18 week last disease assessment . The secondary endpoint overall survival ( OS ) , ( investigator-rated ) PFS , objective response rate ( ORR ) , duration response time progression ( TTP ) . Demographic characteristic evenly balance ( mean age 54 year , [ 59 % ] Caucasian two female ) . In treatment group approximately half patient hormone ( estrogen progesterone ) receptor-positive disease receive previous adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy ( 184 patient [ 45.8 % ] pertuzumab group vs 192 patient [ 47.3 % ] placebo group ) . Most ( 37.3 % 40.4 % , respectively ) previously receive anthracyclines approximately 10 % previously receive trastuzumab ( 11.7 % 10.1 % ) . A total 43 % patient group receive prior radiotherapy . The mean baseline leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) 64.8 % pertuzumab group 65.6 % placebo group ( median 65.0 % , range 50 % -88 % two group ) . The CLEOPATRA study show statistically significant improvement IRF-rated PFS pertuzumab group v placebo ( hazard ratio [ HR ] =0.62 ; 95 % CI=0.51 ; 0.75 , p &lt; 0.0001 ) increase median PFS 6.1 month . Median PFS 18.5 month pertuzumab group vs 12.4 month placebo group . Moreover , CLEOPATRA show statistically significant improvement overall survival pertuzumab group v placebo ( hazard ratio [ HR ] =0.68 ; 95 % CI=0.56 ; 0.84 , p &lt; 0.0002 ) increase median OS 15.7 month . Median OS 56.5 month pertuzumab group vs 40.8 month placebo group . Despite clear benefit combination therapy pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel compare combination therapy trastuzumab docetaxel study population CLEOPATRA study might slightly different patient population , pertuzumab , plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel trastuzumab plus docetaxel apply routine clinical practice . This non-interventional approach aim confirm clinically relevant outcome show phase III CLEOPATRA study patient advance HER2-positive breast cancer routine practice . Data efficacy , safety , tolerability quality life document purpose .</detailed_description>
