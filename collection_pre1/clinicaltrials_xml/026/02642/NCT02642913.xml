	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety enzalutamide without sorafenib different dos . Enzalutamide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment advanced prostate cancer . Enzalutamide block protein call androgen receptor . Experiments liver cancer cell animal model show block androgen receptor cause liver cancer stop grow . Enzalutamide approve treat liver cancer . The investigator want see enzalutamide safe patient liver cancer tumor grow sorafenib . The investigator also want see safe effective sorafenib enzalutamide liver cancer patient never treat sorafenib . This first time enzalutamide sorafenib use together . This treatment may help treat participant 's cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Enzalutamide With Without Sorafenib Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open label , phase I/II study enzalutamide without sorafenib define safety , MTD , pharmacokinetic parameter regimen advance HCC patient . The study 4 part indicate Study Schema , enzalutamide dose escalation ( Part 1A ) , sorafenib enzalutamide dose escalation ( Part 1B ) , dose expansion cohort Part 1A Part 1B MTDs ( Part 2 ) . Dose escalation occur use standard 3 + 3 design describe Section 4.2.1 . For Part 2 , enzalutamide expansion cohort ( Part 2A ) , enroll 10 patient exploratory nature ; however , allow acquisition additional PK sampling MTD , determination safety efficacy . The MTD sorafenib enzalutamide combination expansion ( Part 2B ) design use Simon minimax design formally evaluate 4-month PFS .</detailed_description>

If tissue available , pretreatment biopsy necessary eligibility Age ≥ 18 yearsold ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ChildPugh category A Adequate hepatic function define : Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 5.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Adequate hematologic function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1200/mm3 ( ≥ 1.2 x 10^9/L ) Platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3 ( ≥ 75 x 10^9/L ) Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL ( ≥ 80 g/L ) Adequate renal function define : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min ( use CockcroftGault equation ) Patients must antiviral therapy per local standard care active occult hepatitis B ( HBV ) infection . Patients active hepatitis C ( HCV ) may antiviral therapy . Patients history hypertension well control ( BP ≤ 140/90 ) regimen antihypertensive therapy . Gastrointestinal disorder opinion treat physician would impair absorption . Sexually active subject ( men woman ) must agree use medically accept barrier method contraception ( e.g. , male female condom ) course study . All subject reproductive potential must agree use barrier method second method birth control course study . Female subject childbearing potential must pregnant lactate screen . Participants must capable understand comply protocol requirement sign informed consent . Fibrolamellar carcinoma mixed hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma For patient receive enzalutamide monotherapy , failure intolerance prior sorafenib require enrollment . For patient receive combination therapy , prior sorafenib exclude . Patients may receive cytotoxic , biologic small molecule kinase inhibitor systemic therapy f least 3 week prior first dose study treatment . Patients must receive prior regional therapy ablation , embolization , radiation therapy least 2 week prior first dose study treatment . Patients receive therapy evidence radiologic progression site progress measurable disease . Known brain metastasis cranial epidural disease unless adequately treat radiotherapy and/or surgery ( include radiosurgery ) stable least 3 month study enrollment . Eligible subject must without corticosteroid treatment time study enrollment . History seizure include febrile seizure condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior stroke , brain arteriovenous malformation , head trauma loss consciousness require hospitalization ) . Also , current prior treatment antiepileptic medication treatment seizures history loss consciousness transient ischemic attack within 12 month enrollment . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease include : Myocardial infarction within six month prior Screening ; Uncontrolled angina within three month prior Screening ; Congestive heart failure NYHA class 3 4 , subject history congestive heart failure NYHA class 3 4 past , unless screen echocardiogram MUGA scan perform within 3 month result leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45 % ; History clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( e.g. , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , torsades de pointes ) ; History Mobitz II second degree third degree heart block without permanent pacemaker place ; Anticoagulation warfarin Inability swallow tablet Subjects history another primary cancer , exception : curatively resect nonmelanoma skin cancer ; curatively treat cervical carcinoma situ ; primary solid tumor know active disease present opinion investigator affect patient outcome set current HCC .
