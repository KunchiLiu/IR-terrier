	<brief_title>Microwave Ablation Versus Resection Resectable Colorectal Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Surgery Surgical resection operable colorectal liver metastasis current gold standard . With advancement surgical technique technology 3-year survival rate group patient range 60 % [ 1 ] survival without resection virtually non-existent . Palliative chemotherapy prolong survival 12-24 month , rarely much [ 2 ] . Operability decide general health condition patient , global liver function tumour associate factor like number , size distribution liver metastasis . It uncommon disqualify surgery general health patient , sometimes reality advanced age severe comorbidities . The combination size , number distribution liver metastases determines extent resection thereby size liver remain surgery . This critical factor postoperative liver failure often fatal . With otherwise healthy liver , approximately 75 % parenchyma resect remain 25 % within year regenerate total liver volume around 80-90 % original liver [ 3 ] . This regenerative capacity use make complex resection stage , manipulate initially small liver remnant sufficient size survival . Liver surgery , however , come price . For small local resection laparoscopic minor hepatectomies morbidity surgery 20-30 % quarter serious . For major complex procedure morbidity 40-50 % proportion serious complication require surgical intervention death [ 4 ] . With advanced patient support state art surgical technique , mortality follow surgery small , typically range 1-2 % . The patient spend 5-14 day hospital incapacitated month two open surgery , significantly less laparoscopic surgery patient usually return home 2-7 day hospital early return normal physical activity within two week . Another factor take account frequency liver recurrence . After resection , 50-80 % patient get new liver metastases [ 5 ] . With previous major resection choice follow surgical strategy get limited . Ablations Local ablation technique evolve local injection cytotoxic agent like ethanol acetic acid thermal ablation freeze tissue heating radiofrequency energy , laser beam microwave energy . Ablations also do destroy cell membrane electricity short intense burst , irreversible electroporation technique , cause localise cell death little heat thereby preserve collagen structure surround protein , result patent vessel , bile-ducts nerve sheath [ 6 ] . The ablative procedure two critical point ; correct localization energy correct amount energy . Ablation wrong place decrease efficacy incorrect size ablation . Targeting lesion improve computer assist target fusion radiological modality much information possible use placement energy source . Percutaneous ultrasound target recently common mean placing ablation device liver lesion . Local recurrence rate 20-30 % typically report approach . With recent fuse computer assist technique local recurrence rate often state around 5-10 % [ 7 ] . The main limitation ablative technique size lesion . Many study show good result lesion le 30mm diameter increase recurrence rate large lesion . A single ablation usually 40-50mm diameter . Larger lesion treat multiple application geometry ovoid ablation irregular tumour make complete ablation difficult . Destroying lesion ablative technique spare liver parenchyma allows treat patient resectable situation multiple lesion engage liver segment . This approach greatly increase survival group patient . Sparing unaffected liver parenchyma also increase flexibility liver recurrences metastatic disease . This happen 50 percent patient local resection ablation third patient major hepatectomies focus ablative approach function liver parenchyma save option treatment recurrence wider . Lesions target percutaneous approach use ultrasound fuse magnetic resonance image computer tomography , CT guidance technique , laparoscopically need . Very rarely open approach need . This mean patient usually go home day day treatment return normal physical activity within week . Morbidity area 10 % fourth serious complication require kind intervention . Mortality typically low 1 % . Local thermal ablation show equal resection treatment hepatocellular carcinoma lesion less 30mm size . These data come retrospective analysis single centre experience low scientific grade evidence [ 8,9 ] . Study design consideration There well-powered randomized study compare ablative strategy resective . Doing non-inferiority randomize study sufficient power would need thousand patient group , thus make study virtually impossible conduct . A way come around use propensity score technique compare case control . The investigator well document control swedish liver registry allow propensity score match data . With design 100 patient treat , computed power calculation survival curve resective treatment colorectal liver metastasis . Data extract `` Livermet survey '' , on-line prospective database 25000 hepatectomies colorectal cancer 69 country . Data first resection single metastasis small 30mm ( best case scenario ) extract survival curve compute . With non-inferiority assumption , power 90 % non-inferiority limit bad 5 % reduction 3-year survival , sample size 100 compute , see figure . CLINICAL AND ECONOMICAL CONSEQUENCES If study thesis hold would great impact treatment colorectal liver metastasis approximately half could treat minimal invasive low-complication ablation strategy , greatly reduce patient morbidity increase possibility treatment modality case tumour recurrence liver . With much short hospital stay sick-leave great potential big saving health-related cost health service provider . From Engstrand et al . In manuscript . This show distribution 272 liver metastasis colorectal cancer among population base cohort 1032 patient diagnose primary great Stockholm area 2008 . Approximately half patient eligible resection could potentially treat ablation . STUDY DESIGN European multicentre prospective cohort study propensity score matching number tumour , age , gender response chemotherapy ( chemo - response/stable disease - progression ) . Patients colorectal liver metastasis evaluate weekly liver multidisciplinary conference treatment strategy decide . In decision process patient resectable tumour 30mm less 5 number , deem ablatable resectable , offer treatment ablative strategy use state art target microwave ablation device . During study inclusion phase , sequential specific week year ( one two/three/four/five depend local consideration ) , patient fulfill inclusion criterion must enter database . All ablation do computer assist CT target ( Cascination AG , Bern , Ch ) allow precise image documentation evaluation tumour , ablation device placement result ablation zone . Repeat ablation allow new multidisciplinary team conference ( MDT ) discussion mandate loss disease control . Patient characteristic procedure relate parameter record outcome measure overall survival three year use survival analysis . Secondary outcomes tumour state ( disease free interval ) , complication , local recurrence rate , accuracy placement ablative device , analyse ablation volume , length stay need treatment ablation resection . Treatment chemotherapy decide MDT protocol use neoadjuvant adjuvant treatment surgical resection . Patients give informed consent enter study . Patient data store secure password-protected server Red-cap software belong Karolinska Institutet Danderyd Hospital . Procedural data store together image series download directly ablation aim device Artorg Centre University Bern , responsible volumetric precisional data analysis study . Patient recruitment primarily great Stockholm area . All treatment swedish patient Danderyd Hospital , Stockholm Sweden . A second centre Inselspital Bern , Switzerland , third Groningen Netherlands . With optimal inclusion rate study recruit necessary patient within one year . TIME FRAME September 1 : finalization protocol submission ethic board November 2015 : Start inclusion November 2017 ? : Inclusion complete 2018 : Publication intervention specific data like workflow , precision ablation volume . 2020 : Three year follow-up finish file close main study 2021 : Publication result 2023 : Evaluation publication 5-year survival data 2028 : Evaluation publication 10-year survival data .
