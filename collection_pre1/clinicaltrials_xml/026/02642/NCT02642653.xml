	<detailed_description>This first multi-modal treatment combine target treatment FXS , lovastatin , innovative parent-implemented intervention ( PILI ) target language challenge behavior deliver telehealth technology.The hypothesis target treatment effective applied combination PILI . Examination whether change activity key pathways/proteins influence FMRP ( mitogen-activated protein kinase ( ERK ) MMP-9 ) biomarkers treatment responsiveness . Because lovastatin also anti-inflammatory , characterization MEK/ERK signal peripheral immune cell pre- post- treatment carry determine whether level signal molecule predictive biomarkers treatment response . It hypothesize individual elevate inflammatory cytokine profile responsive lovastatin treatment . Once modeled FXS , result study apply neurodevelopmental disorder include Rasopathies . The behavioral component propose multi-modal treatment Parent-implemented Intervention ( PILI ) target improvement spoken language challenge behavior 10- 17-year-olds FXS increase parental verbal responsiveness ( PVR ) within picture-book base story-telling episode . Parents encourage use target strategy everyday interaction child . The intervention deliver parent home way video teleconferencing ( VTC ) . Participants randomly assign receive behavioral intervention alone combination Lovastatin .</detailed_description>
