	<brief_summary>In patient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) complicate coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , antiplatelet drug commonly use prevention recurrence stent thrombosis cardiovascular event combination anticoagulant drug . Based observation incidence hemorrhagic complication increase antiplatelet drug administer combination vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) , guideline antithrombotic therapy PCI US EU recommend DAPT ( dual anti-platelets therapy ) use AF-complicated CAD patient short time possible follow single anti-platelet VKA , monotherapy VKA start one year PCI . In 2013 European Heart Rhythm Association ( EHRA ) publish guideline use NOACs NVAF patient , state NOACs may advantage VKAs term anti-thrombotic effect NVAF patient undergo PCI . However , clinical evidence ever generate reveal efficacy safety mono-drug therapy NOACs stable CAD patient one year PCI . AFIRE study plan evaluate efficacy safety mono-drug therapy rivaroxaban stable CAD patient . Among NOACs , rivaroxaban choose evidence Japanese patient result sub-analysis ROCKET AF suggest rivaroxaban effective VKA reduce incidence myocardial infarction ( MI ) .</brief_summary>
