	<brief_title>Treatment Digital Ulcers Korean Patients With Systemic Sclerosis : Prospective Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) chronic autoimmune disease unknown etiology high morbidity mortality . SSc manifest fibrosis skin internal organ . Although underlying mechanism still subject investigation , endothelial dysfunction abnormal immune response think contribute vascular dysfunction fibrosis SSc . A hallmark feature SSc presence Raynaud phenomenon ( RP ) cause reversible vasoconstriction digital artery trigger exposure cold emotional stress . In 33-43 % SSc patient , ischemia progress digital ulcer ( DUs ) , often associate pain also severe limitation daily activity , anxiety depression among others . In severe case , RP complicate superinfection gangrene , require surgical amputation . The mainstay treatment RP restoration decrease blood flow use calcium channel blocker , protstanoids , phosphodiesterse V inhibitor , endothelin receptor blocker . However , efficacy safety medication RP-associated ulcer definitive , especially Korean patient SSc . In addition , remain unknown whether Korean SSc patient respond well treatment others . Study aim include 1 . To establish new prospective cohort SSc patient DU Korea.. 2 . To investigate current situation SSc patient Korea . 3 . To investigate compare efficacy safety current medical treatment DU SSc patient Korea</detailed_description>
