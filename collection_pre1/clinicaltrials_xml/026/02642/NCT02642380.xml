	<brief_title>Different Cycles High-dose Dexamethasone Initial Management Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia ( ITP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake multicenter , randomize , control trial 200 primary ITP adult patient 11 medical center China . One part participant randomly select receive four cycle high-dose dexamethasone ( give orally dose 40mg per day 4 consecutive day every 14 day 4 cycle ) , compare others one cycle ( give orally dose 40 mg per day 4 consecutive day ) . Platelet count , bleed symptom evaluate treatment . Adverse event also record throughout study . In order report efficacy safety different cycle high-dose dexamethasone therapy treatment adult ITP .</detailed_description>
