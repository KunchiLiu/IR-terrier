	<brief_summary>Since development year ago bipolar energy surgery operative hysteroscopy , hysteroscopic treatment menorrhagia endometrial ablation achieve either use monopolar bipolar current , parallel technique label 'second generation ' ( microwave , radio frequency , thermal destruction ... ) treat uterine cavity . It seem use bipolar energy decrease rate adhesion prospective data success rate bipolar endometrial ablation poor currently recommendation choice technique use . No prospective assessment exist date literature compare difference efficacy bleeding use monopolar bipolar current . The goal study compare two energy , measure amount bleeding calculate Higham score 12 month intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Efficiency Bipolar Energy Versus Monopolar Energy Endometrial Ablation Women Having Menorrhagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Menorrhagia one main symptom manage Gynecology . The evaluation volume menorrhagia perform PBAC score ( pictorial bleeding assesment chart ) . The one described Higham allow quantify qualify period hemorrhagic score 150.The surgical treatment choice long hysterectomy . Many study evaluate efficacy , safety cost different technique perform . A recent review literature identify eight randomize clinical trial show slight advantage hysterectomy , comparison ablation endometrium , improvement symptom patient 's satisfaction . Hysterectomy however associate long surgery duration longer recovery period . Moreover , adverse event ( major minor ) , significantly common hysterectomy . A retrospective study examine long-term result hysteroscopic endometrectomies . During monitoring , carry 4 10 year , menorrhagia stop 83.4 % case . Over period , 16.6 % patient undergo hysterectomy menorrhagia return . In term cost , one study show total direct indirect cost hysteroscopic treatment menorrhagia significantly low hysterectomies.Endometrial ablation thus offer alternative hysterectomy surgical treatment menorrhagia . Several instance author recommend surgery first line medical treatment failed.Initially , hysteroscopic surgical treatment menorrhagia perform monopolar endoscopic ablation , require use glycine distension medium . Complications proper monopolar ablation describe . Because complication , use bipolar energy developped since several year . Other technique know 2nd generation technique emerge : use microwave , radio frequency , thermal destruction endometrium . They comparable efficiency success rate around 70 % disadvantage comprehensive histology much expensive . This diminish use cost purchase device . Although hysteroscopic bipolar ablation routine technique , study literature compare efficacy treatment use monopolar bipolar energy , endometrial resection hysteroscopy , menorrhagia management.The goal study compare two energy , measure amount bleeding calculate Higham score 12 month intervention .</detailed_description>
