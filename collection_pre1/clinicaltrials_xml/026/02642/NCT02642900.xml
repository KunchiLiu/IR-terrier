	<detailed_description>Different Candida specie , include albicans , tropicalis , parapsilosis , present human oral microbiota , gastrointestinal tract vagina . These specie typically harmless commensal . Candida albicans , prevalent specie , may present 80 % healthy individual . This species find high frequency dental prosthesis think main pathogen associate stomatitis elderly denture wearer . Biofilms Candida albicans usually find intravenous catheter , prosthesis , biofilms promote high resistance antifungal drug . The standard treatment stomatitis topical antifungal agent , include nystatin miconazole . The use topical antifungal agent cause problem . Poor responses agent result dilution fast elimination drug action saliva , reduce drug 's concentration . The drug 's toxicity cause mild transient gastrointestinal side effect , nausea , vomit diarrhea . Alternative treatment adjuvant treatment use treat disease , use probiotic bacteria photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) use non-toxic dye ( photosensitizer - PS ) combination source visible light peak wavelength suitable absorption PS . The photodynamic process rapidly generate reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) peroxide , hydroxyl radical , superoxide ion singlet oxygen . Singlet oxygen implicate major causative agent cellular damage photodynamic process , cause cellular damage host tissue . The amount ROS formation main predictor yeast killing . This study aim evaluate effectiveness photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) treatment denture stomatitis complete denture wearer .</detailed_description>
