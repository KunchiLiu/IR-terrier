	<brief_summary>The investigator propose treat patient metastatic esophageal cancer dysphagia two fraction brachytherapy follow pembrolizumab . The brachytherapy hypofractionated provide radiation dose sufficient intensity induce release tumor-derived antigen trigger antitumor immune response . The simplicity design maximize chance examine hypothesis radiotherapy induce immune response , augment pembrolizumab treatment . Success study would provide impetus conduct trial aim develop unique strategy broadly applicable therapeutic option treatment patient suffer deadly cancer , provide important mechanistic insight relationship radiation treatment immune therapy augmentation . Taken together , data indicate target PD-1/PD-L1 axis esophageal cancer combination radiation therapy may rational treatment strategy cancer .</brief_summary>

Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Either enrol HRPO # 201107221 ( `` Tissue Blood Acquisition Genomic Analysis Collection Health Information Patients Gastrointestinal Cancers '' ) , facilitate collection specimen correlative study , consent collection blood tissue part protocol research test . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . Prior treatment esophageal cancer . Prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen 4 ( CTLA4 ) antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) . Received live vaccine within 30 day prior first dose pembrolizumab . A history malignancy ≤ 3 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose pembrolizumab . Currently receive investigational agent , participate study investigational agent , use investigational device within 4 week first dose pembrolizumab . Known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least 4 week prior first dose MK3475 neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pembrolizumab agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness would limit compliance study requirement . This would include , limited : ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , immunosuppression , autoimmune condition , underlie pulmonary disease , psychiatric illness/social situation . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment within past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid , immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g . thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . History ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 72 hour study entry .
