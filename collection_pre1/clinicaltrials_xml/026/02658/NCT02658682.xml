	<brief_summary>Depression ( Major Depressive Disorder ; MDD ) dub `` common cold among mental illness '' also highly recurrent disorder . Secondary prevention identify key goal long-term management depression . High recurrence rate suggest specific vulnerability factor increase people 's risk develop repeat episode disorder . Preventive strategy identify ameliorate factor reduce individual 's risk subsequent episode . Biased attention emotional stimuli central cognitive model increase sensitivity negative cue believe fuel negative thought feeling depression play key role maintain illness . Selective bias attention modify simple computerized technique ; The Attention Bias Modification Task ( ABM ) . This project aim investigate whether ABM reduce surrogate clinical marker relapse large group highly vulnerable depressive episode . The effect ABM , immediately two week intervention , three key risk factor depression study : Residual symptom , cortisol awaken response emotion regulation strategy . The participant follow 1 month , 6 month 12 month . The hypothesis ABM reduce subsequent episode low mood follow 12 month group manner predict early change risk factor investigate . It also test effect lab may dependent candidate gene affect serotonin reuptake implicated malleability emotional learning . Effects underlie neural correlate emotion regulation study fMRI experiment sub-sample also stratify serotonin transporter genotype ( see also NCT02931487 ) . The predictive value meta cognition relate rumination possible mediating effect automatic thought perceive stress also investigate sub group ( see also NCT02648165 ) . The characterization cognitive , genetic neural mechanism underlie ABM effect key implication future treatment development combination treatment modality like pharmacotherapy .</brief_summary>
