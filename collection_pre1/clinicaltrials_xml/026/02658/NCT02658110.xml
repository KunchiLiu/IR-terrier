	<brief_summary>The propose study aim determine metabolic appetite response standard breakfast lunch meal whilst alter time whey protein supplementation . Currently , designs implement many study mean unclear whether optimum time whey protein consumption exist order promote great acute health benefit . A number study investigate effect whey protein consume preload subsequent meal , whilst benefit also show whey protein ingest meal . The propose study therefore investigate strategy whey protein supplementation vary practical applicability , use meal reflect regular eating behaviour throughout population sample overweight/obese individual . Findings study may provide important information regard efficacy whey protein supplementation , composite meal , effect handle subsequent mixed-macronutrient meal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Appetite Responses Altered Timing Whey Protein Ingestion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomised crossover design shall implement , whereby participant complete 4 trial separate minimum 3 day . On visit participant shall consume standardised mixed-macronutrient breakfast meal , follow 180 minute later consumption standard lunch meal . The timing additional protein supplementation shall vary trial , participant consume shake contain 20g whey protein isolate either preload ( 15 minute prior breakfast ) , alongside breakfast meal , 15 minute follow breakfast consumption . A control trial shall also complete without additional protein supplementation . At supplementation time point participant shall consume either flavour whey protein shake flavoured water isovolumetric beverage ensure remain blinded condition . Venous capillary blood sample visual analogue scale ( determination subjective appetite sensation ) shall take regular interval follow meal participant rest .</detailed_description>
