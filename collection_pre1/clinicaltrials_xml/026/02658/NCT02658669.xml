Although Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Insomnia ( CBT-I ) show effective evidence-based treatment insomnia , publish randomize control trial evaluate potential strength and/or limitation CBT-I post-mTBI patient . Therefore , assess CBT-I context mTBI hold promise provide substantial benefit term improve rehabilitation outcome Veterans suffer mTBI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This VA Rehabilitation Research Development Career Development Award ( CDA-2 ) proposal design significantly advance application Behavioral Sleep Medicine practice treatment Veterans see VA Healthcare System , especially recover traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . TBI deem `` signature wound '' Iraq Afghanistan Wars , occur 19.5 % Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn ( OEF/OIF/OND ) service member . For many Veterans , mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) associate persistent post-concussive symptom , especially sleep disturbance .

To address important clinical issue , propose randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) attempt assess efficacy Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Insomnia ( CBT-I ) versus Sleep Education control Veterans insomnia history mTBI . CBT-I recommend American Academy Sleep Medicine treatment chronic insomnia also adopt VA within Evidence Based Practice roll-out program .
