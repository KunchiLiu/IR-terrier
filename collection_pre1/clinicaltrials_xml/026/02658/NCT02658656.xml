	<detailed_description>Background Veterans spinal cord injury ( SCI ) many adverse secondary medical quality life ( QOL ) change result immobilization . Veterans SCI complete rehabilitation injury unable ambulate receive wheelchair standard care ( SOC ) mobility . Powered exoskeleton technology recently become available alternate form mobility provide external framework support computer control motorized hip knee joint assist overground ambulation . Research Questions ( Objectives ) Will Veterans chronic SCI six month duration , medically stable use wheelchair SOC plus exoskeletal-assisted walking ( EAW ) device home community environment clinically meaningful net improvement mental health , bladder , bowel , pain patient-reported outcome compare use SOC ? Additionally , use EAW device four month home and/or community participant result reduction total body fat mass ? Study Design A two-group ( Intervention Control ) , randomize , clinical trial perform one-year feasibility component . The Intervention group receive SOC plus EAW . The Control group receive SOC . The study require six year total complete include ten VA SCI Services study site . A feasibility phase employ use staggered start initially start six site four site start one year later . These initial six site use assess start-up activity [ hire , training , equipment procurement , Central Institutional Review Board ( CIRB ) paperwork , etc . ] , rate recruitment , issue may value successful completion study . Lessons learn implemented remain site . Relevance VA In pilot study conduct James J. Peters VA Medical Center , Bronx , NY , improvements mental-emotional health , physical health body composition demonstrate provide participant ability walk 4 6 hour per week course three five month . As July 2014 , Class 2 designation establish Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) `` powered exoskeleton '' . To date , one device ( ReWalk ) receive FDA Class 2 approval institutional home use currently available prescription . The Department Veterans Affairs ( DVA ) large single provider person SCI USA , care 26,000 42,000 estimate Veterans SCI . The VA presently lack infrastructure support Veterans SCI train use device order make technology available home/community use . A control research study would anticipate optimal manner demonstrate efficacy , amount use safety power exoskeleton home community environment ; finding would immediately transferable clinical care . Number Research Participants ( Sample Size ) One hundred-sixty participant ( 80/group ) randomize . Each 10 study site expect pre-screen 100 potential participant , screen 60 participant , randomize 16 participant ( 8 per group ) 2-year enrollment period . Participating Sites Ten SCI Services select basis potential recruitment number ( N=9,511 total Veterans SCI sit ' catchment area N=4,921 follow annually site ) geographic location , permit even distribution across country . The ten site include : Boston , Richmond , Augusta , Tampa , Hines Chicago , Minneapolis , Dallas , Houston , Palo Alto , Long Beach . Of ten site , six VA Cooperative Studies Program ( CSP ) Network Dedicated Enrollment Sites ( NODES ) . Duration Participant Intake ( Study Duration ) The CS # 2003 study duration project total six year : The initial six site start-up year , follow participant enrollment/data collection year 1 2 , continue data collection/closeout year 3 , total four year . The remain four site begin start-up year one year first six site follow enrollment , data collection closeout schedule next four year . The four site expect complete one year initial six site complete , additional year Coordinating Center Chairperson 's Office complete data analysis manuscript writing , thus study total time six year . Participants group ask commit 33 week study . Participants Control arm offer additional 8 week receive EAW training medical center , without outcome data collect . Treatment ( follow-up ) The intervention test four month home and/or community use power exoskeleton . Definition Participant Samples ( Study Population ) One-hundred sixty male female Veterans chronic SCI , six month duration , 18 year age , functional use hand , medically stabile , wheelchair user indoor outdoor mobility , eligible screening . All potential participant Veterans SCI . Study participant generally outpatient exception inpatient meet eligibility criterion , approve Site Investigator ( e.g. , inpatient may admit wheelchair fit another non-medical reason ) . Non-veterans SCI . Treatment Arms All participant receive four month treatment , randomize two arm : SOC plus EAW SOC . Endpoints Primary outcome one Mental Component Summary Veterans Rand-36 ( MCS/VR-36 ) . Primary outcome two sum T-score SCI-QOL bladder management difficulty , bowel management difficulty pain interference item bank . The major secondary outcome total body fat mass . The two primary major secondary outcome analyze proportion participant group achieve clinically meaningful change score . The endpoint success failure outcome .</detailed_description>
