	<brief_title>GO-203-2C + Bortezomib For Relapsed Or Refractory MM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve GO-203-2C treatment disease . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve bortezomib treatment option disease . The purpose research study test safety GO-203-2C bortezomib . GO-203-2C newly discover compound bind oncoprotein ( cancer cause protein ) call MUC1 . Myeloma cell harbor increased amount MUC1 cell surface . By bind MUC1 , GO-203-2C show cause tumor cell death laboratory study . Bortezomib intravenously subcutaneously administer medication belongs class drug call proteasome inhibitor . Proteasome inhibitor disrupt normal action cell breakdown protein normal cancer cell . This disruption stall tumor growth cause cancer cell die . Bortezomib currently approve treatment multiple myeloma . The Investigators want find high dose GO-203-2C give combination bortezomib administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants multiple myeloma experience disease progression recent treatment regimen . Patients must prior treatment proteasome inhibitor , immunomodulatory drug , eligible transplant autologous transplant . Patients must measurable disease , define 1 following : serum Mprotein &gt; 0.5 g/dL . For patient IgA myeloma Mprotein quantify SPEP , total IgA &gt; 0.5 g/dL . Urine Mprotein &gt; 200mg/24h serum FLC assay : involve FLC level &gt; 10 mg/dL abnormal FLC ratio Greater equal 18 year age ECOG performance status ≤2 ( see Appendix A ) Life expectancy great 3 month Participants must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥2,000/mcL platelet ≥50,000/mcL total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ( patient Gilbert syndrome Bilirubin ≤ 3.5 mg/dL eligible ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Women childbearing potential must document negative pregnancy test . The effect GO2032c develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion GO2032c administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 14 day ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 14 day earlier . The use steroids equivalent 160 mg dexamethasone allow within 14 day screen , last dose give least 1 day prior initiation treatment . Participants receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled hypertension . This define sustained blood pressure elevation &gt; 140/90 despite antihypertensive therapy . Patients allow start antihypertensive therapy meet eligibility criterion ; however stable antihypertensive regimen least 7 day . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study GO2032c agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother GO_2032c , breastfeed discontinue mother treated GO2032c . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance : Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Hypersensitivity bortezomib , boron mannitol . Grade 3 4 peripheral neuropathy . Prior discontinuation bortezomibbased therapy due toxicity attribute bortezomib . Use GCSF administration within 7 day screen Platelet transfusion within 7 day screen</criteria>
