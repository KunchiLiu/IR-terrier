	<brief_title>A Clinical Evaluation Oxitone Non-invasive Oximeter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Oxitone® 1000 oximetry reading accurate measure acceptable relative absolute difference ( RAD ) compare accepted measurement system ( FDA recognize predicate ) `` Reference '' . The objective : 1 . To validate Oxitone® 1000 performance continuous spot oximetry monitoring , relative Reference reading . 2 . To aggregate longitudinal clinical data COPD patient measure SpO2 , pulse rate activity . 3 . To evaluate main device parameter characteristic sensor placement tolerance , device accuracy , precision , convenience easy-to-use stationary supine seat test mild motion well . 4 . To determine whether measure data provide patient ( SpO2 , pulse rate movement ) useful adjust treatment protocol . 5 . To assess safety tolerability ( compliance ) Oxitone® 1000 continuous oximetry monitor order obtain sufficient clinical trial data order define performance criterion device system acceptable / useful medical context patient population healthy individual , device likely use . Overview : The trial shall assess accuracy Oxitone® 1000 measure oxygen saturation , compare measurement reference device : non-invasive SpO2 pulse-rate value determine pulse oximeter . A total approximately 40 subject ( 20 healthy 20 COPD patient ) enrol . These subject enrol medical center pulmonary department recruit clinic patient base . The subject represent male female adult optimally cover range ethnic background ( skin pigmentation ) . All test perform singleton blind fashion . This study conduct approval medical center ethic committee.This comparison open study subject follow-up . Procedure : All instrument check functionality battery operational capacity , prior subject attachment include data collection system , i.e . wireless ( B.T . ) connectivity P.C . ( synchronized bidirectional two channel ) . The `` Reference '' oximeter device shall set average mode 12 second . Two sensor place simultaneously subject : A standard SpO2 ( reference ) place subject 's index finger test Oxitone® 1000 place subject 's wrist hand . Methods : : The investigator study approximately 40 subject , normal , i.e . comparison group patient variety pulmonary condition effect oxygen saturation . The investigator compare oxygen saturation subject measure Oxitone® 1000 device oxygen saturation measure calibrated conventional FDA approve pulse oximeter ( predicate ) . The `` Reference '' . No treatment decision make utilizing result test device . Trial design : A . Healthy subject : Spot-check measurement 20 healthy volunteer simultaneously test use Oxitone oximeter standard fingertip pulse oximeter stationary state i.e . sit stand position 6 minute . 1 . A 6-minute.walk : oximetry test 20 healthy volunteer simultaneously test use Oxitone oximeter standard fingertip pulse oximeter accordance industry ( Medical ) standard 6-min walk protocol . Measurements collect record continuously prior test , test 6 minute test . The distance 6-min walk record ( CRF ) . B. COPD ( Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) subject 1 . Spot-check measurement 20 ambulatory COPD patient . Patients refer admitted pulmonary lab clinical treatment rehabilitation procedure . Measurements make simultaneously use Oxitone® oximeter standard fingertip pulse oximeter stationary state e.g . supine dorsal elevate sit , stand ( upright ) position 6 min . 2 . A 6-min walk oximetry test ambulatory COPD patient . Patients refer pulmonary lab clinical purpose rehabilitation procedure . The measurement take use Oxitone® oximeter standard fingertip pulse oximeter accordance standard protocol . Measurements take continuously prior test , test 1 minute test , rest . The distance 6-min walk record . Rehabilitation subject procedure . The measurement take use Oxitone® Oximeter standard fingertip pulse oximeter accordance standard protocol . Measurements take continuously prior test . The distance 6-min walk record .</detailed_description>
