	<brief_summary>This single-arm phase II trial Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda ) patient advance , unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . The primary objective ass therapeutic efficacy patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The primary endpoint disease-control rate ( DCR ) define proportion patient achieve best overall response either complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) ( maintain least 8 week ) . Secondary endpoint include progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) , duration response ( DOR ) , toxicity profile Pembrolizumab . The investigator also evaluate expression level Programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L-1 ) tumor tissue , well serum titer hepatitis B C patient hepatitis B C , respectively , specimens available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study open-label , single-institution , non-randomized , single-arm , Phase II study pembrolizumab therapy patient advance HCC . Patients treat three-week cycle , intravenous ( IV ) administration pembrolizumab day 1 3-week cycle . Trial therapy last withdrawal consent , disease progression and/or unacceptable toxicity , whichever occur first . Correlative study investigate PD-L-1 expression tumor tissue assess clinical outcome . Peripheral blood also draw perform immunologic marker hepatitis B C viral titer . This determine viral titer change treatment . These study include patient consent correlative study ( See Appendix F ) . There additional consent correlative study . Up 28 patient enrolled Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center ( SCCC ) . Investigators expect enroll 10-12 patient per year base institution 's enrollment capacity . Expected time complete total accrual approximately 1.5 year . Expected time study completion 3 year date open enrollment allow survival data . An interim analysis plan 14 evaluable patient assess DCR determine whether continue additional 14 .</detailed_description>
