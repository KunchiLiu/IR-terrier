	<detailed_description>The project aim : - Primary objective evaluate safety 3 different dosage ( 20µg - 50µg 100µg ) PRIMVAC vaccine adjuvanted either Alhydrogel® GLA-SE , administer D0 , D28 D56 healthy European Burkinabe adult . - Secondary objective ass : - humoral immune response PRIMVAC vaccine antigen ( VAR2CSA ) measure variation level total IgG level isotypic subtypes capable recognize native antigen . - cellular immune response measuring : - number T cell secrete IL5 IFNg follow ex-vivo stimulation vaccine antigen - B lymphocyte phenotype isolate PBMC - Exploratory objective : - To explore quality humoral immune response measure capability antibody specific vaccine antigen : - Cross-react different VAR2CSA variant express surface erythrocyte infect various strain Plasmodium falciparum , - Inhibit interaction parasitized erythrocyte express different VAR2CSA variant Chondroitin Sulfate A ( receptor involve placental sequestration ) , - Promote opsonic phagocytosis parasitized erythrocytes various strain Plasmodium falciparum express different VAR2CSA variant - To explore quality cellular immune response induce vaccine antigen quantitation large panel cytokine ELISpot supernatant .</detailed_description>
