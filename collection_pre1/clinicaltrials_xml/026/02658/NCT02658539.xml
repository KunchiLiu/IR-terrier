	<brief_summary>Research show body composition key component health future disease risk . Being overweight obese associate high body fat composition , great risk develop type II diabetes heart disease . The location fat store body become increasingly recognise important predictor risk , extra fat around abdomen waist ( refer android pattern fat distribution 'apple ' shape ) think increase disease risk store fat around thigh buttock ( gynoid pattern fat distribution 'pear ' shape ) . As result , significant interest technique accurately monitor detect change body composition , also physiological lifestyle factor influence body fat , lean tissue mass bone mineral density . This cross sectional human study look physiological , behavioural genetic factor relate total body composition 1,196 healthy men woman age 18 70 year . Interested applicant invite attend single visit Hugh Sinclair Unit Human Nutrition University Reading . This visit last around two hour include noninvasive measure body composition ( bio-electrical impedance dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) , arterial stiffness fast measure metabolic health . Diet physical activity monitor four day period use diet activity diary , activity monitor . The finding study contribute evidence base subject characteristic influence body composition inform design future human study body composition methodology .</brief_summary>
