	<brief_title>Vinorelbine With Trastuzumab Emtansine Pre-Treated HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II , single arm , open-label clinical trial design establish recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) vinorelbine fix dose trastuzumab emtansine . The study also evaluate safety efficacy RP2D patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive metastatic , locally advanced , unresectable breast cancer . The study open accrual University Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center ( SCCC ) main campus constituent satellite site , Deerfield Beach Plantation . This phase I/II study total 50 enrol patient , take account 10 % drop-out phase II follow-up . The duration anticipate enroll study subject Phase I/II 2 year . The estimated duration Investigators complete study ( Phase I/II ) 4.5 5 year . For phase I portion , standard 3+3 dose escalation/de-escalation design apply . Approximately 15 21 patient need establish recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) . For phase II portion study , 35 patient treat RP2D ( MTD ) include 6 patient treat RP2D phase I . Patients may remain treatment combination disease progression unmanageable toxicity . Tumor assessment conduct every 6 week ( ±7 day ) week 18 . Thereafter , assessment do every 12 week ( ±7 day ) . These shall occur regardless dose delay dose interruption , Investigator-assessed progressive disease ( PD ) , death , whichever occur first . More frequent tumor assessment may perform clinically indicate , discretion treat Investigator . For phase II portion study - patient discontinue treatment reason PD continue require tumor assessment complete PD initiation new therapy . Once patient progress , follow survival approximately every 3 month least 3 year . Subsequent anti-cancer therapy document study completion . Patients discontinue study treatment return Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit approximately 30 day ( ±7 day ) last dose study treatment .</detailed_description>
