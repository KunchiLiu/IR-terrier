Messages design specifically patient risk lung cancer , personalize present gain-framed manner , take account demographic smoke history . The aim second intervention evaluate efficacy novel , biofeedback-based intervention provide personalized individual-level feedback biomarkers lung cancer risk improve response cessation , deliver gain-framed way . The biomarkers include skin carotenoid status , spirometry , plasma bilirubin , improve cessation . The study team examine whether biofeedback prevents relapse quit lead reduction smoke lung nodule patient fail quit . Additionally , study attempt evaluate impact smoke cessation miRNA profile human serum , especially miRNAs let-7 family , know tumor suppressor function , hypothesize increase response cessation .</detailed_description>
