	<brief_title>Vosaroxin Infusional Cytarabine Treating Patients With Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess rate complete remission ( CR ) induction therapy combination `` 7+V '' ( vosaroxin standard dose infusional cytosine arabinoside [ ara-C ] ) patient newly diagnose , previously untreated acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Frequency grade 3-5 adverse event related administration `` 7+V '' . II . To evaluate presence minimal residual disease ( MRD ) remain `` 7+V '' induction and/or re-induction . III . To determine CR/CR incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) rate one and/or 2 cycle `` 7+V '' induction . IV . To determine time neutrophil platelet recovery follow `` 7+V '' induction . V. To assess disease-free survival ( DFS ) 1 year ( yr ) patient achieve CR/CRi `` 7+V '' induction . VI . To assess overall survival ( OS ) 1 yr patient receive protocol-defined therapy . VII . To determine correlation hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) comorbidity index Wheatley Index score disease response , DFS OS . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : - I . To describe mutational burden cohort AML patient . - II . To correlate genomic aberration response rate , DFS , OS . - III . To determine number patient treat vosaroxin eventually go allogeneic HSCT . OUTLINE : Patients receive vosaroxin intravenously ( IV ) day 1 4 cytarabine IV continuously day 1-7 ( Induction-I ) . Patients residual leukemia second course indicate judgment investigator may undergo second course treatment ( Induction-II ) 14-57 day day 1 Induction-1 After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
