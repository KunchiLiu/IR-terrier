	<brief_summary>The purpose study design predictive model stroke recovery base baseline measurement arm movement brain physiology . The expectation development formula predict person 's response arm rehabilitation program provide chronic phase ( 6 month great post stroke ) recovery . The study include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , genetic test use saliva , arm exercise program consist robot-assisted exercise combine functional arm exercise call transition task training ( TTT ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After informed consent , baseline neurological exam , MRI brain , TMS , questionnaires , cognitive testing , robot evaluation , arm function test occur . Baseline test occur first 4-6 week participation include three separate session approximately 1 week part examine arm strength , range motion , ability perform functional task . Additionally , one robot evaluation , one MRI two TMS session complete . We also collect genetic data use saliva sample examine potential genetic polymorphism might influence response therapy . The intervention phase consist 12 week robot arm exercise training ( TTT ) . Interventions occur 3 time per week 12 week total 36 visit . Additional time visit allow visit occur 4 time per week 4 additional week ( exceed 16 week ) schedule conflict arise . The intervention sessions one hour duration . During hour long intervention , 45 minute robotic intervention follow 15 minute TTT . Two separate robot target different movement use 3 phase robot training . The training sequential 12 session complete wrist robot , follow 12 session shoulder-elbow robot final 12 session alternate wrist elbow-shoulder robot .</detailed_description>
