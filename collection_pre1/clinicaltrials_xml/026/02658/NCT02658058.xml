	<brief_summary>Traditionally , spinal anesthesia perform use palpation bony landmark identify level point entry spinal needle . Recently , ultrasound image become increasingly popular procedure among anesthesiologist guide neuraxial blockade . Most study pre-procedural ultrasound-guided neuraxial technique limit midline approach use transverse median view . The parasagittal oblique view consistently offer well ultrasound view neuraxis compare transverse median view . However , still evident whether superior parasagittal oblique view lead easy paramedian needle insertion . In literature , study directly compare US-guided paramedian approach use parasagittal oblique ( PSO ) view , US-guided midline approach use transverse median view , conventional landmark midline approach perform spinal anesthesia elderly patient , particular teaching novice anesthesia resident .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-procedural Ultrasound Techniques Versus Conventional Landmark Technique Spinal Anesthesia Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study find optimal technique perform spinal anesthesia resident train . Thus investigator compare preprocedural ultrasound-guided paramedian technique use parasagittal oblique view vs preprocedural ultrasound-guided midline technique use transverse median view v landmark-guided midline technique spinal anesthesia elderly population . Our hypothesis preprocedural US-guided technique superior conventional landmark-guided midline technique regard ease performance define success rate first attempt , number puncture attempt , spinal procedure time , patient satisfaction .</detailed_description>
