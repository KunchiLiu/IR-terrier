	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis malignant glioma enrol institution : WHO grade IV tumor ( GBM variant ) WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytoma oligodendroglial tumor WHO grade II glioma , MRI show contrast enhancement Tumor recurrence previous treatment , must include least radiation therapy one cytotoxic chemotherapy . There limit number previous recurrence line treatment . Previously obtain tumor sample exhibit hypermutator phenotype . For purpose trial , hypermutator phenotype define tumor harbor 30 mutation ( nonsynonymous somatic point indel mutation ) detect MSKIMPACT comparable next generation sequence perform CLIA environment . Contingent approval MSK Principal Investigator , patient le 30 mutation may eligible display mutation mismatch repair gene mutation gene know associated hypermutator phenotype microsatellite instability , include limited MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , POLE , POLD determine validated method , microsatellite instability present , identify polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) validate method . *Note : The MSKIMPACT ( Integrated Mutation Profiling Actionable Cancer Targets ) assay next generation genomic profiling perform formalinfixed , paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tumor tissue CLIAcertified Molecular Diagnostic Service laboratory . IMPACT provide full exon coverage 410 cancer relate gene detect base substitution , small indels , copy number alteration select gene rerearrangements . In case , additional assay Sanger Sequencing fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) may require confirm specific result detected IMPACT . Patients MSK assay determine eligibility . Use validate nextgeneration sequence technique eligibility may consider , provide perform CLIAcertified laboratory approve MSK Principal Investigator . Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . Be ≥ 18 year age day sign informed consent . An interval ≥ 12 week end prior radiation therapy require unless either : ) histopathologic confirmation recurrent tumor , ii ) new enhancement MRI outside radiation treatment field An interval ≥ 4 week last administration investigational agent treatment prior first dose pembrolizumab Must recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event previous treatment . Note : Surgical resection recurrent tumor prior enrollment allow . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 Demonstrate adequate organ function per . All screen lab perform within 14 day treatment initiation . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥ 5.6 mmol/L without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR measure calculated creatinine clearance ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≥ 60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy test . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 9.7.2 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Subjects require escalate chronic supraphysiologic dos corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/d prednisone equivalent ) control disease time registration Previous current treatment antiCTLA4 , antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency , include Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Unable undergo MRI brain ( i.e . pacemaker contraindication MRIs ) . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow .</criteria>
