	<detailed_description>Interoceptive awareness ( IA ) awareness bodily signal highlight important many early theory emotion . William James one first present psychological theory link viscero-afferent feedback emotional experience . The process bodily thus interoceptive stimulus may crucial component yield empathy , since affective state often assume involve awareness oneÂ´s bodily state . The assumption close relationship interceptive awareness empathy support consider region recruit process , like insula anterior cingulate cortex . Although especially affective component may implicate interoception interoceptive awareness , impact interoception empathy never evaluate behaviorally neurophysiologically . Also associate alter insula anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) function Alexithymia . Alexithymia , personality trait , mark cognitive affective feature include difficulty identify describing feeling well distinguish feeling bodily sensation emotional arousal . Recent study find negative correlation prefrontal glutamate ( Glu ) mental perspective take well extraversion . Even though several functional imaging study investigate neuronal signature interoceptive awareness personality trait alexithymia , little known functional relevance neurotransmitter concentration</detailed_description>
