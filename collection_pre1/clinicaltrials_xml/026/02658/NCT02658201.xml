	<detailed_description>In haematological malignancy immunocompromised patient , constipation common symptom cause number factor treatment . Chemotherapy certain analgesic medication major contributory factor addition inadequate fluid intake reduce mobility treatment . In current practice , abdominal radiograph first image investigation constipation non specific abdominal pain support exclude clinical suspicion constipation . However , skin entrance dose 1.5 msv plain film radiation exposure gonad . Children sensitive radiation induce adverse effect especially thyroid gland bone marrow . Immunocompromised patient also risk develop second malignant neoplasm . Ultrasound proven detect faecal loading rectum without ionize radiation difficult ass entire length colon largely depend operator 's experience . MRI alternative imaging modality without ionize radiation . Imaging peritoneal cavity abdominal MRI traditionally challenge primarily bowel motion long acquisition time standard T1 T2 weight sequence . The recent development ultrafast 2 dimensional FIESTA sequence GE Healthcare base balance steady state free precession ( b-SSFP ) pulse sequence several advantage , include motion insensitivity ( interfere peristalsis ) , sharp edge definition high contrast compare standard SSFSE pulse sequence . FIESTA image allow clear delineation intra-peritoneal retroperitoneal anatomy capable depict vascular anatomy lymph-adenopathy .
