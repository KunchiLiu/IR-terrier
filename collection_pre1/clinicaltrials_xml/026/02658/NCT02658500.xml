	<detailed_description>Throughout human lifetime , intestinal microbiota performs vital function , barrier function , metabolic reaction , trophic effect , maturation host 's innate adaptive immune response . Therefore , human health depend gut health . It report human gut microbiota healthy adult highly resilient stable time . And reach maturity , microbiota must develop birth establish mutually beneficial cohabitation host . However , early development microbiota infant influence many factor , prenatal parameter , influence mother microbiota , therapy occur around time birth . Human milk sole source nutrition infant first week month birth , evolve provide nutrition immunological protection extra-uterine environment infant bear . But breastfeed possible , human newborn may circumstantially feed infant formula . The difference feed mode demonstrate strong influence early gut colonization particularly probiotic bacteria . Studies show breastfed infant higher count Bifidobacteria Lactobacillus low count Bacteroides , Clostridium , coccoides group , Staphylococcus , Enterobacteriaceae compare formula-fed infant .</detailed_description>
