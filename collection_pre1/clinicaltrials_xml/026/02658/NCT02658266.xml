	<brief_title>Effect Resistance Training Adults With Complex Congenital Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number adult complex congenital heart disease increase today outnumber child correspond lesion . However , longterm prognosis still unknown continuously change new therapeutic option introduce . Patients complex congenital heart disease reduce muscle function compare healthy control well patient lesion classify simple . Furthermore , men congenital heart disease commonly underweight less commonly overweight obese compare general population . In addition , men complex lesion short comparison control . This indicate alter body composition i.e . muscle mass , fat mass bone density population . Moreover , impaired muscle metabolism report patient palliated Fontan procedure . Adult patient complex congenital heart disease recruit base defined inclusion exclusion criterion . Muscle function , muscle strength , muscle metabolism body composition evaluate randomisation follow-up twelve week . The patient randomise twelve week home base resistance train control group . The randomisation ratio 1:1 ( intervention : control ) . The control group instruct continue habitual physical activity . The resistance training protocol individualise base result muscle function muscle strength test . The aim study investigate effect resistance training muscle function , muscle strength , body composition muscle metabolism adult complex congenital heart disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Complex congenital heart disease ( e.g . tetralogy Fallot , transposition great artery , pulmonary atresia , patient palliate Fontan procedure total cavopulmonary connection ) . Clinically stable without significant change last 3 month . Adult ( &gt; 18 year age ) . Informed consent . Cognitive impairment affect ability independent decision making . Present strategy regularly execute resistance training &gt; 2times per week purpose increase muscle strength . Other comorbidity affect physical activity . Other circumstance make participation unsuitable .</criteria>
