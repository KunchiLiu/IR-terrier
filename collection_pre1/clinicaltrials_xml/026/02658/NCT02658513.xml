	<brief_summary>Recently publish European guidance recommend evaluation radiation dose bone marrow patient undergoing radioiodine therapy thyroid cancer . The method describe guideline require serial blood sample take patient , follow sophisticated analysis determine radiation dose . However , radiation risk assessment carry locally indicate relatively high radiation exposure receive operator take blood sample , may prohibit procedure carry routinely . The radiation dose operator lower duration blood sample procedure reduce . The investigator hypothesize use lancet pipette collect blood finger tip greatly reduce time spend proximity patient , significantly reduce operator exposure allow procedure perform routinely . The propose method also less invasive patient compare intravenous sample recommended guideline . A proof-of-principal pilot project use radioiodine dilute expect concentration blood indicate use small volume blood ( lancet ) compromise accuracy dosimetry measurement compare large-volume standard blood sample . The primary aim study investigate whether sample small volume blood use lancet pipette replace standard intravenous blood sample bone marrow dosimetry patient undergoing radioiodine treatment thyroid cancer . Statistical test determine whether significant difference dos calculate use blood sample method . In addition , investigator measure radiation exposure receive operator procedure use Electronic Portable Dosimeters . The result measurement use quantify reduction operator radiation exposure afford new technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment : Patients recruit trial pool routine referral therapy . Potential participant receive information leaflet via post several week advance attendance clinic . Patients opportunity telephone study team time answer question . Patients interested participating procedure explain verbally physicist study team upon attend therapy . The patient time consider whether participate study . Written consent seek commence therapy . Procedures : In light recent guideline , propose new clinical protocol include blood sample take patient in-patient stay . On day treatment , blood sample take 2h 6h radioiodine administration , time clearance measurement . Thereafter , blood sample take patient per day , time one clearance measurement . In addition , blood sample take patient attend whole-body SPECT/CT scan . These blood sample analyse laboratory use standard radiation measurement procedure determine blood dose accord European guideline . This study involve patient blood sample take two different method time point describe . In first method , butterfly needle use gain intravenous access antecubital fossa , heparinised vacutainer use collect 4ml blood sample . The needle removed venepuncture site dress plaster . In second method , single-use safety lancet use puncture skin finger , small pipette use collect small quantity blood . The entire pipette transfer sample tube later process . The puncture site finger dress small plaster . The exact start end time sample record use radio-controlled standard clock . While carry blood sampling , operator wear electronic portable dosimeter ( EPD ) measure radiation exposure . This device position operator 's chest reflect whole body dose receive , configure record radiation dose function time procedure . After procedure , data EPD download split two segment represent blood sample procedure , use record time information . Each segment integrate give total radiation exposure receive operator procedure . At end treatment , patient ask two blood sample method tolerable . Each sample label patient identification number , date , time radioisotope ( I-131 ) . To minimise risk spill , sample transfer tray move Nuclear Medicine Department use trolley . Sample manipulation carry low level count laboratory Nuclear Medicine Department . Three 1ml aliquot whole blood remove vacutainer transfer appropriately labelled sample container use Eppendorf pipette . The volume sample collect pipette determine measure weight sample subtract previously determine combine weight empty pipette sample tube . Once blood sample collect process , measurement take automated gamma counter determine concentration radioiodine . The counting time pipette sample increase compare intravenous sample , order ensure final dosimetry calculation influence statistical uncertainty measure count small volume sample . The result data use detailed dosimetry calculation , accordance publish European guideline . Sample Size : There publish data available intra-patient variation bone marrow dose use either two propose blood sample method . Without knowledge expect variance measurement question , accurate sample size calculation possible prior commencing study . A sample size 35 patient use pilot study - sample size chosen base number patient see department therapy . Recruiting sample size 35 patient achievable within 2 year time frame . However , study stop early total annual radiation exposure operator , combine total radiation exposure due normal clinical workload , likely exceed annual UK dose constraint 2mSv whole body radiation exposure ( The Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 , SI 1999/3232 ) . Data Analysis : Using measure concentration radioiodine blood sample , radiation dose bone marrow participant calculate follow method describe European guidance ( Luster et al , Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 35 ( 10 ) 1941 2008 ) . This calculation perform two blood sample method , create paired measurement variable participant . The statistical significance percentage difference bone marrow dose calculate blood sample method assess use Wilcoxon match pairs test null hypothesis difference calculate bone marrow dose . This study 80 % power demonstrate 5 % level statistical significance difference le 5 % mean value two bone marrow dos . Therefore statistical analysis difference 80 % power show null hypothesis difference great 5 % tenable , indeed null hypothesis hold true population . The radiation exposure receive operator blood sample procedure measure use Electronic Portable Dosimeter ( EPD ) wear chest operator . The data split two use know start end time blood sampling procedure . The data integrated time period calculate total radiation dose interval . This create pair measurement variable blood sample event participant . The statistical significance percentage difference radiation exposure receive operator blood sample method assess use Wilcoxon match paired test null hypothesis difference measure radiation dos . The aim case show statistically null hypothesis difference mean radiation dose 2 technique untenable .</detailed_description>
