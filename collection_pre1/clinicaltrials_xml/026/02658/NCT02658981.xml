	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study safety best dose anti-LAG-3 ( anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 ) urelumab alone combination nivolumab treat patient glioblastoma return ( recurrent ) . Anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 , urelumab , nivolumab antibody ( type protein ) may stimulate cell immune system attack tumor cell . It yet know whether anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 urelumab alone combination nivolumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-LAG-3 Urelumab Alone Combination With Nivolumab Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose maximum administrate dose anti-lymphocyte activation gene-3 ( LAG-3 ) antibody ( BMS-986016 ) ( anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 ) anti-cluster differentiation 137 ( CD137 ) antibody ( BMS- 663513 ) ( urelumab ) give independently combination anti-programmed death-1 ( PD-1 ) antibody ( nivolumab , BMS-936558 ) safely patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall survival . II . To estimate 1 year progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate . III . To estimate radiographic response ( radiographic assessment neuro-oncology [ RANO ] immunotherapy response assessment neuro-oncology [ iRANO ] ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pharmacodynamic effect anti-LAG-3 antibody ( BMS-986016 ) , anti-CD137 antibody ( BMS- 663513 ) , and/or anti-PD-1 antibody ( BMS-936558 ) biomarkers peripheral blood , include T cell compartment , serum protein ( cytokine immune modulators ) . II . To assess pharmacodynamic activity tumor tissue peripheral blood treat subject undergo optional tumor biopsy . III . To explore potential association biomarker measure anti-tumor activity analyze marker inflammation , immune activation , host tumor growth factor , tumor-derived protein pre-treatment on-treatment setting . IV . To characterize occupancy immune cell function multiple dose level anti-LAG-3 antibody ( BMS-986016 ) , anti-CD137 antibody ( BMS-663513 ) , and/or anti-PD-1 antibody ( BMS-936558 ) . OUTLINE : PART A : This dose-escalation study monotherapy Anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 Anti-CD137 ( urelumab ) . Patients assign 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 intravenously ( IV ) day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive anti-CD137 ( urelumab ) IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 15 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART B : This dose-escalation combination therapy portion study Anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 plus Anti-PD-1 ( nivolumab ) Anti-CD137 ( urelumab ) plus Anti-PD-1 ( nivolumab ) . Patients assign 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive Anti-PD-1 ( nivolumab ) IV 60 minute anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 IV day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive Anti-PD-1 ( nivolumab ) IV 60 minute day 1 15 urelumab IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 60 day , every 2 month 2 year , every 6 month thereafter . Patients take treatment reason disease progression follow every 2 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
