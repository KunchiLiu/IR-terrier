	<brief_title>Talimogene Laherparepvec ( T-VEC ) Breast Cancer Local Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Participant receive study drug cycle . Cycle 1 3 week every cycle 2 week . If participant find eligible take part study , receive talimogene laherparepvec injection tumor Day 1 cycle . If doctor think participant 's best interest , may also receive injection area skin disease spread . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycles 1 2 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , do last 7 day . - At Cycle 2 , photograph take lesion participant 's chest . On Day 1 Cycle 5 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 7 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check immune system , tumor marker test . - Participant CT PET/CT scan check status disease . Participant may bone scan , PET/CT available . - Photographs take lesion participant 's chest . - If doctor think need , participant core biopsy check immune system check status disease . On Day 1 Cycle 7 every odd number cycle ( Cycles 9 , 11 , 13 , ) : - Participant physical exam . - Photographs take lesion participant 's chest . On Day 1 Cycle 9 every 4 cycle ( Cycles 13 , 17 , 21 , ) : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test tumor marker test . - Participant CT PET/CT scan check status disease . Participant may bone scan , PET/CT available . Length Treatment : Participant may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : After participant 's last dose study drug start new treatment , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check immune system , possible . Follow-Up Visits : About 30 day end-of-treatment visit every 3 month 1 year , participant follow-up visit phone call learn . After 30 day , instead clinic visit , study staff review participant 's medical record . If participant call , take 2 minute . This investigational study . Talimogene laherparepvec ( T-VEC ) FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma . It consider investigational use T-VEC treat breast cancer . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 35 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
