	<brief_summary>Cerebrovascular disease major cause disability worldwide . The catastrophic burden stroke dramatic low- middle- income country , scarcity evidence-based rehabilitation intervention represent major challenge global health care . Upper limb weakness frequent stroke , universally accept treatment effectively improve hand function patient moderate severe motor impairment . These patient deepest need rehabilitative intervention . This project address important issue , test effect novel approach . The investigator non-invasively stimulate peripheral nerve order enhance effect motor train aid electrical stimulation device patient moderate severe hand weakness . Our hypothesis peripheral nerve stimulation enhance effect motor train patient chronic stage stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peripheral Nerve Stimulation Motor Training Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective protocol determine whether neuromodulation intervention associate functional electrical stimulation , combine task-specific training several session , decrease upper limb motor disability , motor impairment , overall disability improve quality life compare sham intervention functional electrical stimulation . The intervention consist three session per week , six week , outpatient functional electrical stimulation paretic wrist task-specific training . In session , either active peripheral nerve stimulation ( PNS ) sham PNS apply . Before first session , patient familiarize procedure .</detailed_description>
