	<brief_summary>Nearly 3 billion people rely biomass combustion meet basic domestic energy need . Many household use traditional cookstove meet energy need , result extremely high indoor air pollution concentration . Indoor air pollution biomass combustion account estimate 3.9 million premature death per year , represent 4.8 % global disease burden . Improved stove design potential substantially reduce indoor air pollution exposure . However , randomize intervention trial , previous stove intervention study plague low improve stove adoption sustain use , severely limit interpretation study . This research propose conduct community survey in-depth interview among Honduran cookstove user gain insight complex pathway surround barrier predictor sustain improved cookstove adoption ( among target population propose intervention ) . This information use conduct enhance randomize improve cookstove intervention among 300 Honduran family , incorporate qualitative quantitative measure cookstove use measure pre- post-intervention change pollutant exposure subclinical indicator cardiovascular health . The primary goal twofold : - To incorporate community-engaged approach throughout aspect research - To maximize sustained stove use ( thereby maximize health impact intervention ) achieve valid exposure-response estimate . Both objective utilize innovative strategy fill knowledge gap . The research team build upon previous study Latin America focus identify validate appropriate field technique exposure health assessment rural area develop country . In summary , propose project provide insight regard barriers/predictors sustain cookstove adoption , issue impede research field ; ass relationship stove use indicator cardiovascular health , substantial quickly grow disease burden develop country ; result comprehensive valid assessment impact cookstove intervention .</brief_summary>
