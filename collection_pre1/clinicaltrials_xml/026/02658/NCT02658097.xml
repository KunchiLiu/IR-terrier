	<brief_title>A Randomized Two Arm Phase II Trial Pembrolizumab Alone Sequentially Following Single Fraction Non-ablative Radiation One Target Lesions , Previously Treated Patients With Stage IV NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 randomize two arm phase II trial pembrolizumab alone sequentially follow focal radiation one target lesion , previously treat patient stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . The primary goal trial compare efficacy focal radiation ( RT ) index lesion way enhance anti-tumor immune response pembrolizumab pembrolizumab alone . The primary efficacy endpoint overall RECIST-defined response outside radiation field . To accomplish goal 66 patient randomize 2:1 ( stratify histology ( squamous versus non-squamous ) refractory versus non-refractory disease ) radiation plus pembrolizumab pembrolizumab , respectively . Primary Objective : To determine tumor response outside radiation field ( abscopal effect ) radiation follow pembrolizumab metastatic NSCLC . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine progression-free overall survival patient NSCLC receive pembrolizumab , receive Single Fraction Radiation Therapy ( SFRT ) 2 . To determine safety toxicity combination SFRT pembrolizumab 3 . To examine potential predictive biomarkers tumor sample peripheral blood patient treat pembrolizumab SFRT 4 . To determine local control SFRT radiate lesion , SFRT give pembrolizumab 5 . To evaluate induction T-cell response patient metastatic NSCLC treat radiation effect radiation</detailed_description>

If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential must willing use adequate method contraception Contraception , course study 120 day last dose study medication . Note : Abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject Male subject childbearing potential must agree use adequate method contraception Contraception , start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Note : Abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Patients active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide clinically stable least 4 week , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis also steroids 3 day prior dose study medication . Stable brain metastasis definition establish prior first dose pembrolizumab . Has prior chemotherapy , within 2 week prior study treatment . Patients targeted therapy ( tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) may go study 5 day therapy . Patients recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 2 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid , evidence interstitial lung disease active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C. Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow .</criteria>
