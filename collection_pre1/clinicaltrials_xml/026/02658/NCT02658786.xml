	<brief_summary>Chronic liver diseases differ etiology among leading cause morbidity mortality worldwide [ 1 ] . Chronic liver disease progress different pathological stage vary mild hepatic inflammation without fibrosis advance hepatic fibrosis cirrhosis [ 2 ] . Assessment stage liver disease important diagnosis , treatment , follow-up treatment cessation treatment . A liver biopsy old accurate method use evaluate liver histology progression chronic liver disease . Furthermore , different histological score system develop modified [ 3 ] . A liver biopsy consider gold standard assess liver histology [ 4 ] . During pathological progression liver fibrosis , excessive amount extracellular matrix build ; furthermore , serum level various biomarkers change , addition appearance new biomarkers serum different stage fibrosis [ 2 , 5 ] . Recently many noninvasive marker ( NIMs ) assess liver fibrosis develop , frequently use clinical practice . They validate different study , find highly accurate assessment liver fibrosis compare liver biopsy [ 6-7 ] , always use standard reference method evaluate accuracy noninvasive method . There limited study document cost effectiveness non invasive marker invasive technique . Most people chronic Hepatitis B C unaware infection , put serious risk develop cirrhosis liver cancer life threaten . Similarly patient non alcoholic fatty liver diseases unaware fibrosis liver . About 20-50 % persistent infection end fibrosis finally cirrhosis . Invasive non invasive diagnostic method widely use detect fibrosis . Clinicians use different drug combination treat HBV HCV infection . However , scarcity longitudinal prospective study ass cost effectiveness diagnostic measure . We plan conduct retrospective follow prospective cohort study among case underwent biopsy ILBS GB Pant Hospital since 2000 till Dec 2020 HBV infection , HCV infection , non alcoholic fatty liver disease . For retrospective cohort study , collect data hospital information system patient HBV infection , HCV infection , non alcoholic fatty liver disease , underwent biopsy period 2000-Dec 2015 . The new patient HBV infection , HCV infection , non alcoholic fatty liver disease undergo biopsy period Jan 2016- Dec 2020 serve cohort prospective design . We collect socio-demographic data , clinical data , family history , personal history , medical history , anthropometry , biochemical radiological data patient . We also conduct cost effective analysis various non invasive marker biopsy gold standard predict fibrosis , retrospective prospective cohort . For prospective cohort study , evaluation baseline biopsy result , case metavir fibrosis score ( F0-3 ) follow period 5 year document incidence development progression fibrosis . No additional investigation test ask patient study . We also develop predict model development progression fibrosis .</brief_summary>
