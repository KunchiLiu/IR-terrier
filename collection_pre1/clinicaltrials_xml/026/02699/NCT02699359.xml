	<brief_summary>The HS-1000 innovative non-invasive monitoring device employ advanced acoustic signal analysis calculate ICP continuous basis . Initial HS-1000 clinical data also show promise assess variety cerebral hemodynamic parameter cerebral blood-flow , auto regulation monitoring , cerebrovascular vessel compliance . In absence non-invasive monitor intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , relationship , , may exist concussion , time concussion ( e.g . acute , resolve , resolve ) ICP unknown . The new HS-1000 non-invasive device may provide insight assessment possible ICP change follow concussion child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Unlike fracture , concussion difficult recognize diagnose , give lack specific diagnostic test clinical finding . Current diagnostic recommendation include multi-factorial approach involve symptom inventory , baseline post-injury neuropsychological assessment , balance testing . Lacking paradigm truly objective measure physiological change associate concussion . In addition , post-concussion symptom unique individual vary occurrence , degree , severity . For reason , clinical diagnosis concussion make healthcare provider familiar athlete knowledgeable concussion symptom recognition evaluation . This study aim determine ICP measurement derive HS-1000 non-invasive device child adolescent see Akron Children 's Hospital Sports Medicine Clinic concussion ( anytime care ) compare ICP value obtain age gender match Akron Children 's Hospital Sports Medicine Clinic patient history head injury . Patients history and/or symptom head trauma care Akron Children 's Hospital Sports Medicine Clinic invite participate study . Study participant receive HS-1000 ICP read continuous 16 minute interval 30 degree supine position . Recordings obtain one session . When possible , recording obtain initial examination follow-up visit . Sports Medicine staff coordinate HS-1000 device earplug insertion recording interfere , marginally delay patient 's normal , routine clinical evaluation .</detailed_description>
