	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Diabetes Self-Management Education Program Based Behavioural Change Theory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Type 2 Diabetes ( T2DM ) prevalent , costly healthcare service associate significant mortality ; 1.5 million death occur directly diabetes low middle-income country ( WHO,2014 ) diabetes predict seventh lead cause death 2030 . Ajlouni et al ( 2008 ) estimate approximately one million people Jordan diagnose type 2 diabetes ; figure increase . More half million Jordanians uncontrolled level Glycosylated Hemoglobin ( HbA1c &gt; 7.5 % ) due factor sedentary lifestyle poor medication management . To prevent diabetes microvascular macro vascular complication , increase effort attention need direct towards improve glycaemic level improve metabolic outcome appropriate glycaemic management . Intensive diabetes management anti-hyperglycaemic medication alone may improve metabolic outcome , may also lead side effect patient hypoglycaemia weight gain . Patients diabetes strongly recommended engage self-management glucose level may best achieve educate patient self-management diabetes . Didactic intervention show improve metabolic outcome , although benefit last less six month sustain long term . Educational program need target psychological factor patient 's confidence , ensure self-management strategy sustain long term . Barriers diabetes self-management behaviour map Information-Motivation-Behavioural skill ( IMB ) Model behavioural change . The model critically construct base analyse previous intervention address limitation theory use among client HIV risk . Chang et al ( 2014 ) systematically review IMB model-based behavioural intervention find effect IMB model persist 12 month study follow patient 12 month . Aim : To examine effect IMB Model-based Diabetes Self-Management Educational ( DSME ) intervention three self-management activity : patient ' eat habit , physical activity medication management , patient attend National Center Diabetes Endocrinology Genetics ( NCDEG ) . The hypothesis test IMB educational program improve participant ' behavioural outcome self-care 6 month compare control participant . Research protocol method : A two group trial randomise allocation 230 participant 1:1 average group . Intervention group receive educational intervention . Control group receive usual clinical care referral diabetes educational consultation require . This intervention individualise DSME program base Information-Motivation-Behavioural ( IMB ) skills theory . IMB behavioural change theory assumption propose health-related behaviour information , motivation behavioural skill primary determinant promote health behaviour . The intervention base validated DSME toolkit deliver use motivational interview technique two face-to-face session follow-up phone call patient preferred frequency period 3 month . Data collection occur 3 time point ; baseline , 3 month 6 month . Measures include self-management knowledge , motivation , behavioural skill , diabetes outcome ( HbA1c ) , blood pressure weight . At 3 month , participant intervention group select use purposive sampling , participate process evaluation interview . Measurable end point/statistical power study : Primary outcome diabetes self-care activity measure 6 month use Summary Diabetes Self-Care Activities Scale ( SDSCA ) questionnaire . Statistical power 0.8 use calculate study sample .</detailed_description>
