	<brief_title>Clinical Virological Outcome European Patients Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abstract : There currently 1Â½ million people across Europe infect HIV . The epidemic continue intensify Eastern European region prevalence HIV continue increase year come . There significant problem management public health crisis . Available antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) - although extremely effective - eradicate HIV hence continue life . Other limitation development resistance , adverse effect treatment , requirement strict adherence . Despite limitation , widespread use potent ART result dramatic decrease HIV-related mortality across Europe . As incidence AIDS decline , relative importance co-morbidities co-infections , chronic viral hepatitis tuberculosis ( TB ) , increase . Around third EuroSIDA patient co-infected hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , liver-related death second common cause death AIDS . With introduction new potent well tolerate oral direct acting antiviral ( DAAs ) HCV , major change management outcome HCV co-infection anticipate coming year . However due high cost DAAs , access new treatment could vary substantially across Europe . Over 20,000 consecutively enrol HIV-1 positive patient 100 clinical centre 35 European country , Israel Argentina - one quarter eastern region - currently enrol EuroSIDA . New cohort patient normally enrol every 2-3 year ensure region Europe epidemic prevalent represent study give timely information clinical presentation outcome European HIV-1 positive patient . In 2012 , 2500 additional patient enrol EuroSIDA cohort IX . To forefront investigate benefit adverse effect new HCV treatment co-infected patient , next EuroSIDA cohort ( cohort X ) enrol 2014 , exclusively consist 5000 HIV-1 patient positive antibody HCV . The EuroSIDA study group work EuroSIDA study since 1994 several notable accomplishment date , include publication 200 paper peer-reviewed journal ( include New England Journal Medicine Lancet among others ) . The focus EuroSIDA naturally change period , demonstrate eagerness flexible , dynamic , focus contemporary issue , study group commit continue work principle . In recent year , EuroSIDA , addition scientific publication , prioritize capacity build Eastern Europe HIV seminar , host clinician Eastern Europe European AIDS Clinical Society ( EACS ) student office Copenhagen HIV Programme sponsor 2-3 young physician Eastern Europe participate statistical course London every year . Most data collect clinic part routine care . Additionally , central plasma repository use extend early study viral epidemiology HIV ( resistance subtypes ) . Primary study objective : To prospectively study , clinical , therapeutic , demographic , virological laboratory data HIV-1 positive person across Europe order determine long-term virological , immunological clinical outcome . The specific objective , fall four main category , follow : 1 . To examine efficacy ART factor limit 2 . To detect current emerge late onset adverse event among patient ART 3 . To continue surveillance HIV clinic around Europe describe temporal change regional difference 4 . To monitor uptake outcome HCV therapy development direct acting antiviral compare difference EuroSIDA region Study visit : Enrolment + follow-up Data collection : For HIV-1 positive patient enrol follow , laboratory , therapeutic clinical data HIV , viral hepatitis serious non-AIDS clinical event collect , well demographic data possible data pregnancy HIV status newborn baby . The patient see within clinic require accord local physician . EuroSIDA involve patient interview study visit , information collect patient note twice year .</detailed_description>
