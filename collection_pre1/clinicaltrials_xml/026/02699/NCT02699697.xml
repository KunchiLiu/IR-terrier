	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well palliative radiation therapy work reduce pain patient cancer spread original ( primary ) tumor bone ( bone metastasis ) . Palliative radiation therapy use external beam radiation therapy may help patient bone metastasis relieve symptom reduce pain caused cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palliative Radiation Therapy Reducing Pain Patients With Bone Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether 8 gray ( Gy ) x 2 fraction result low re-treatment rate compare 8 Gy x 1 fraction . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether 8 Gy x 2 fraction provide superior pain narcotic relief compare 8 Gy x 1 fraction . II . To determine whether 8 Gy x 2 fraction associate improved quality life compare 8 Gy x 1 fraction . III . To determine whether use bone strengthen agent associate improved pain relief , narcotic relief re-treatment rate . IV . To determine 8 Gy x 2 fraction associate increased toxicity . V. To correlate patient satisfaction , perceive stress , social support treatment outcome . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients undergo 1 fraction external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) 30 minute . ARM II : Patients undergo 2 fraction EBRT 30 minute . The 2 fraction separate 3-7 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 3 month .</detailed_description>
