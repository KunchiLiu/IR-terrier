	<brief_title>Dexmedetomidine Use ICU Sedation Postoperative Recovery Elderly Patients Post-cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due advance surgical anaesthetic technique , increase number elderly patient undergo cardiac surgery . Elderly patient multiple comorbidities undergo cardiac surgery may prolong recovery follow cardiac surgery compare group patient , high risk postoperative delirium , postoperative neurocognitive decline reduce quality life follow hospital discharge . Traditionally , outcome follow cardiac surgery measure term complication rate mortality rates1 . More recently however , quality life ( QoL ) measure increasingly recognize important outcome measurement follow cardiac surgery2 . Factors related cardiac surgery perioperative care could potentially influence later QoL include quality recovery follow surgery , postoperative delirium , postoperative neurocognitive decline . Quality recovery ( QoR ) new concept , aim measure patient 's health status surgery anaesthesia . The use dexmedetomidine spinal surgery associate improved quality recovery early postoperative period3 . There suggestion dexmedetomidine attenuate increase inflammatory mediator stress response4 could role post-surgical stress response . There study attempt correlate dexmedetomidine use quality recovery follow cardiac surgery . The prevalence delirium follow cardiac surgery patient 60 year report range 30-52 % ( 5 , 6 ) . Delirium condition characterize consciousness disturbance , concentration disorder , memory disturbance hallucination . There association make choice sedative prevalence delirium ICU patient . In multicenter randomize trial predominantly involve medical patient ICU , assign receive dexmedetomidine reduce risk delirium spend less time undergoing mechanical ventilation7 . It known choice sedation agent population impact incidence delirium follow cardiac surgery . Delirium associate increased morbidity , prolong hospital stay , increase mortality8 Cognitive decline refers condition intellectual ability memory seem impair patient appear otherwise recover surgery . It condition distinct delirium encephalopathy . Cognitive decline common , persist month year , follow cardiac surgery . The reported incidence cognitive decline coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) report 53 % hospital discharge , 36 % 6 week 42 % 5 years9 . Elderly patient undergo cardiac surgery increase risk postoperative cognitive decline10 . A strong relationship report cognitive decline reduce quality life follow cardiac surgery11 . The goal sedation analgesia patient follow cardiac surgery multifold include postoperative pain relief , facilitation ventilation , resolution hypothermia normalization electrolyte balance . The choice sedative agent however impact postoperative outcome . Dexmedetomidine associate improved quality recovery patient undergo major spine surgery reduce incidence delirium , impact patient 's quality life follow surgery . We hypothesize use dexmedetomidine sedative agent immediately follow cardiac surgery elderly patient would result improved quality recovery reduce incidence delirium postoperative period , compare propofol . We also interest whether associate improvement neurocognitive outcome population .</detailed_description>
