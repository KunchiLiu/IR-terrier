	<brief_title>Efficacy Ultra-micronized Palmitoylethanolamide ( Um-PEA ) Geriatric Patients With Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic pain elderly highly prevalent , often underestimated , associated adverse outcome . Most available analgesic drug often either ineffective tolerate , burden many side effect . Palmitoylethanolamide ( PEA ) endogenous widely distribute N-acylethanolamina involved neuroinflammation pain generate process . Formulations contain ultra-micronized Palmitoylethanolamide ( um-PEA ) available market effectiveness chronic pain highly heterogeneous geriatric patient clear likely generalizable . Investigators plan adopt N-of-1 trial approach objectively test effectiveness ultra-micronized PEA individual level old outpatient . Methods/Design : 65 year old old person refer Geriatric Unit Fondazione IRCSS Ca ' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Milan complain noncancer chronic pain origin eligible . Each trial placebo-controlled randomize crossover trial include two um-PEA ( 600 mg twice day ) placebo treatment pair . um-PEA placebo 3-week period separate 2-week washout interval overcome possible carryover effect . Pain intensity , need on-demand analgesic medication , impact daily activity evaluate . Also , cognitively impaired patient eligible long expression pain recognize frequency assess caregiver . Trial result discuss patient/caregiver treat physician decide whether continue treatment . The impact N-of-1 approach physician 's management plan confidence assess . Investigators secondarily meta-analyse perform N-of-1 trial obtain estimate average effect um-PEA compare placebo use frequentist Bayesian approach . Discussion : While pursue ultimate clinical objective , i.e . empirically objectively decide best treatment choice individual old patient chronic pain , series geriatric N-of-1 trial PEA bring Evidence Based Medicine principle care patient usually represent conventional randomize controlled trial , realize patient-centered outcome approach necessary improve appropriate prescribe elderly patient multimorbidity polypharmacy .</detailed_description>
