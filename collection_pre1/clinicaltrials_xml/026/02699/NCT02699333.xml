	<detailed_description>Microscopic colitis ( MC ) chronic condition common cause watery diarrhea , particularly elderly . The etiology unknown widely consider abnormal immune reaction luminal antigen predisposed host . Drugs autoimmunity also implicate . The aim study : 1 ) To quantitatively classify microscopic colitis use image analysis microscopy determine whether degree lymphocytic infiltration correlate etiology , symptoms prognosis . 2 ) To investigate etiology microscopic colitis examine medical lifestyle risk factor include medication , autoimmunity , diet , smoke 3 ) To evaluate association adherent microbial flora MC ass whether bacterial dysbiosis link presence MC . As exploratory aim evaluate whether CYP2C19 polymorphism common purportedly drug-induced disease since diverse drug associate MC substrates gene . To conduct study investigator obtain detailed dietary , medical lifestyle information study subject undergo complete colonoscopy diarrhea . The investigator obtain colon biopsy right , transverse leave colon evaluate adherent bacterial organism . The investigator draw blood evaluate CYP2C19 polymorphisms future genetic study . The prospective design corrects important limitation prior research MC . Successful completion study aim improve understand risk factor , set stage scientifically ground future research , potentially suggest new intervention disease currently poorly understood .</detailed_description>
