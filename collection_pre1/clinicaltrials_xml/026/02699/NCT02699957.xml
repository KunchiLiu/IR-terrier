	<brief_summary>The Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Registry ( LAAO Registryâ„¢ ) design assess prevalence , demographic , management , outcomes patient undergo percutaneous epicardial base leave atrial appendage occlusion procedure reduce risk stroke . Patient-level data submit participate hospital quarterly basis American College Cardiology Foundation 's National Cardiovascular Data Registry ( NCDR ) . The primary aim LAAO Registry optimize outcomes management patient implementation evidence-based guideline recommendation clinical practice , facilitate effort improve quality safety patient undergo percutaneous epicardial base leave atrial appendage procedure , investigate novel quality improvement method provide risk-adjusted assessment patient comparison nationwide NCDR data . The secondary purpose LAAO Registry serve rich source clinical data support assessment short- long-term safety , comparative cost effectiveness research , scalable data infrastructure post market study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hospitals join Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Registry ( LAAO Registry ) agree term specific contract outlines obligation party annual fee participation . In addition , participate site sign Business Associate Agreement American College Cardiology ( ACC ) per requirement Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act 1996 ( HIPAA ) . The LAAO Registry dataset , comprise approximately 300 data element , create panel expert use available American College Cardiology ( ACC ) , Heart Rhythm Society ( HRS ) , Society Cardiovascular Angiography Interventions ( SCAI ) societal overview document guidance , data element definition , previous trial data element , evidentiary source . Protected Health Information ( PHI ) , social security number , collect . The intent collection PHI allow complete follow-up tracking patient , assist data manager correct data collection error improve data quality , future registry interoperability potential future generation patient-level drill down Quality Outcomes Reports ( see section 11 , Data Analysis Statistical Considerations ) . Registry site opt transmit direct identifier National Cardiovascular Data Registry ( NCDR ) , inclusion direct identifier registry discretion registry site . When use NCDR web-based data collection tool , direct identifier enter partition data collection process data warehouse maintain direct identifier separate analysis datasets . The minimum level PHI transmit ACC participant opts submit direct identifier meet definition Limited Dataset term define Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act 1996 . Data require registry participation collect retrospectively exist medical record concurrently normal course treatment . The Societal Document safety recommendation leave atrial appendage occlusion recommend additional testing contact patient outside hospital episode care 45 day , 6 month , 1 year 2 year post-procedure . All registry data ( in-hospital follow-up ) capture participate site use electronic data collection tool provide LAAO Registry future option available collect data use certified software application review certified compliant transmission specification establish ACC LAAO Registry . Upon completion call data window , participant prepare data submission export data data collection mechanism upload data secure http server ACC use approve encryption software high encryption allow . In recognition importance data quality registry product , ensure data submit NCDR complete , consistent , accurate , Data Quality Program formally establish NCDR 2004 . Upon receipt LAAO Registry data submission , ACC review data electronically report back cod error . Such electronic check verify consistency completeness allow participant ample opportunity submit data satisfies consistency completion threshold . The report produce data check call Data Quality Report ( DQR ) . The DQR provide participant confidential analysis data submission 's completeness , use participant help prioritize data clean effort assess necessity re-submission . Once data meet data quality threshold , Outcomes Report produce . The Outcomes Report aggregate participant 's data provide comparison group ( usually procedure volume base ) national comparison . The NCDR understands need ensure data submit LAAO Registry accurate launch national on-site off-site audit program whereas random set participant participate on-site off-site audit confirm data submit registry consistent data medical record source documentation .</detailed_description>
