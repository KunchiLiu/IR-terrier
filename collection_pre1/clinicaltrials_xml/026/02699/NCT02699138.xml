	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) traditionally attribute collapsible upper airway . However , increasingly recognize multiple additional non-anatomical mechanism contribute disease . Higher rate OSA patient post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) without PTSD report however mechanism behind increased prevalence investigate . Our hypothesis patient PTSD predisposition OSA due low respiratory arousal threshold ( wake easily ) patient without PTSD . The goal project study compare ArTH patient PTSD without . In addition , plan see whether medication use increase arousal threshold treat OSA patient PTSD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) clinically relevant disease associate cardiovascular , metabolic , neurocognitive consequence . OSA common disease ; Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study find OSA affect 2 % woman 4 % men age 30-60 . However , data predate obesity epidemic use modern diagnostic equipment , recent study report prevalence moderate severe OSA high 24 % woman 49 % men . The prevalence OSA find particularly high patient suffer post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . One study veteran combat relate PTSD find 67.3 % population diagnose OSA undergo polysomnography . This finding consistent Mysliwiec et al find rate OSA 63 % post-deployment soldier 51 % active duty soldier . Despite increased recognition association , little progress establish pathophysiological link two disease , study knowledge examine possibility PTSD might drive development OSA . Furthermore , individual PTSD find significantly low compliance continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy general population , claustrophobia , mask discomfort , air hunger commonly cite reason non-adherence . Despite , study show benefit sleep quality PTSD relate nightmare OSA treatment . Alternative OSA therapy therefore particularly important group , rely determination target treat CPAP . While propensity towards upper airway collapse , see obesity , classically consider principle determinate OSA pathogenesis , recent work show non-anatomical variable include ventilatory arousal threshold ( ArTH ) also important . During wakefulness pharyngeal dilator muscle remain active maintain airway patency however sleep muscle lose activity individual OSA airway collapse occur result hypoxia hypercapnia . Both accumulation carbon dioxide increase negative pressure cause recruitment upper airway dilator muscle result pharyngeal patency sleep maintain . Cortical arousal apnea individual represent protective mechanism airway restore resolution hypoxia hypercarbia . However individual low ArTH ( individual wake easily ) sufficient time accumulation respiratory stimulus , recruitment pharyngeal muscle unable occur result disruption sleep . ArTH variable amongst individual dependent magnitude negative intrathoracic pressure tolerate awaken occurs independent factor . A central feature PTSD state persistent hyperarousal chronically persist follow traumatic event . Individuals PTSD find important physiologic change hypothalamic-pituitary axis ( HPA ) sympathoadrenal system include increased level sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine increase activity Î±2-adrenergic glucocortocoid receptor . Both HPA sympathetic nervous system associate attention arousal . Prolonged activation system show induce important biochemical change associate disordered sleep . Indeed , study norepinephrine deficient knockout mouse demonstrate increased stimulus require induce cortical arousal norepinephrine deficient mouse result higher acoustic ArTH compare control . Our hypothesis patient suffer PTSD low ArTH compare subject without PTSD . This work significant low ArTH associate PTSD patient may benefit therapy raise ArTH . Prior study indicate trazodone , serotonin reuptake inhibitor commonly use insomnia occasionally depression , may raise arousal threshold without suppress upper airway muscle activity . This medication therefore present potentially attractive alternative treatment CPAP therapy patient OSA relate low arousal threshold .</detailed_description>
