	<brief_summary>To assess patient hypercapnic respiratory failure use echocardiography , cardiac output measurement marker neural respiratory drive ( EMGpara ) prior , non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) initiation , follow patient 3 month . The investigator hypothesize improvement cardiac function and/or respiratory mechanic time associate ongoing improvement oxygenation , quality life exercise capacity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Respiratory Function With Non-invasive Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory failure characterize incapacity respiratory system maintain normal arterial blood gas homeostasis . Specifically , overlap hypoxaemia hypercapnia ( PaCO2 &gt; 6 kPa ) refer Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure ( HRF ) . HRF one common cause hospital admission high re-admission rate , therefore constitute major burden healthcare system . Non Invasive Ventilation ( NIV ) well establish treatment patient hypercapnic respiratory failure frequently suffer associate pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) . NIV help increase arterial oxygenation reduces hypercapnia . It use patient hypercapnic respiratory failure cause Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ( OHS ) . The associated degree PH lead increase afterload right ventricle ( RV ) cause progressive remodelling right heart . RV dysfunction correlate reduce long term prognosis respiratory condition . In literature NIV show effective method treat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure OHS . It describe NIV impact cardiac function NRD OHS .</detailed_description>
