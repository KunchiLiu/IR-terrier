	<brief_title>CD36 Human Fat Taste Perception</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present , general agreement human perceive five taste quality : sweet , sour , bitter , salty umami ( savory , meaty taste amino acid ) . It believe quality evolve help u find nutrient ( e.g . sweet , umami signal calorie ) avoid potential harmful substance ( e.g . bitter signalized poison ) . Despite fact fat , obtain diet , essential life , fat consider basic taste ; , issue fat precisely sense unresolved . However , increase evidence suggests , addition smell texture , taste play important role fat perception . Putative fat taste receptor class identify animal model . One receptor glycoprotein CD36 , previously document involved trafficking storage fat . CD36 recently find rodent ' human ' taste bud . In rodent , CD36 deletion blunts specifically fat recognition . Although CD36 variant frequent human , role human ' fat taste perception preference remain incompletely understood focus current proposal . The main goal study determine effect common human variant CD36 gene fat taste perception use standardized sensory evaluation technique . In addition , examine whether common variant taste relate gene ( CD36 ) associate individual difference perception flavor milkshakes prepared different amount fat .</detailed_description>
