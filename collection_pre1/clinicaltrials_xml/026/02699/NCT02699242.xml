	<brief_title>Does Training Virtual Reality Bronchoscopy Simulator Improve Performance Bronchoscopic Intubation Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally , fiber optic bronchoscopy ( FOB ) intubation teach see one , one basis . Modern train method skill acquisition involve use simulator . Recently portable , computer base , bronchoscopic simulator ( ORSIM ) develop . The investigator hypothesize operator train ORSIM simulator proficient perform asleep FOB intubation train didactic teach alone . This randomized trial involve 34 consented resident anesthesia assistant ( AAs ) . In preparation , consent person view teach video FOB intubation tip . They perform asleep FOBI OR staff anesthesiologist 's supervision 's familiar study . Those randomized ORSIM group undergo simulator train 30-60 min . Those Didactic group undergo training . Within week , resident/AA perform another asleep FOB intubation . The study result impact FOB intubation teach effectively future .</detailed_description>
