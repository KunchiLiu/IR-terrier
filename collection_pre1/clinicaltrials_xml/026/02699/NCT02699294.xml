	<brief_summary>This randomised-controlled trial investigate whether single intervention manual pressure release combine stretch exercise effect muscle length , pain perception threshold , respiratory function subject latent myofascial trigger point pectoralis minor muscle . First quarter participant receive single intervention manual pressure release combine contract-relax PNF stretch exercise pectoralis minor muscle , second quarter participant receive single intervention manual pressure release combine Z stretch exercise pectoralis minor muscle , single intervention manual pressure release applied third quarter participant final quarter receive intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Of Stretching Exercise Pectoralis Minor Myofascial Latent Trigger Points</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myofascial trigger point hyperirritable point locate within taut band skeletal muscle fascia , cause refer pain , local tenderness autonomic change compress . They classify either active myofascial trigger point ( ATrPs ) latent myofascial trigger point ( LTrPs ) . ATrPs inactivate different treatment strategy ; however , never fully disappear rather convert latent form . Therefore , diagnosis treatment LTrPs important . Invasive noninvasive technique available management LTrPs . Invasive technique include trigger point injection dry needle whereas noninvasive technique include manual therapy technique electrotherapy modality . Manual therapy technique treatment myofascial trigger point include joint manipulation , strain/counterstrain , ischemic compression pressure , massage therapy , myofascial release therapy , muscle energy technique , point pressure release transverse friction massage . Additionally , recent study show myofascial trigger point therapy combine stretch exercise may effective decrease pain level . However , insufficient evidence determine type stretch exercise effective immediate effect muscle length people LTrPs . Therefore , aim randomised-controlled trial investigate effect muscle length , pain perception threshold , respiratory function single intervention manual pressure release combine stretch exercise LTrPs pectoralis minor muscle . The sample size power calculation perform sample size calculator ( InStat ) . The calculation base standard deviation 0.5 point , minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) Pectoralis Minor Index 0.89 point , alpha level 0.05 , Î² level 5 % , desired power 95 % . These parameter generate sample size least 9 participant group . Total 40 subject recruit study order allow loss follow-up . Potential participant invite post flyer Istanbul University , Turkey . Flyer recruitment method use trial effective , yield high number enrolment . All participant complete informed consent form describe purpose procedure test . prior participate study . Forty participant fit inclusion criterion randomly assign one four parallel group ( ratio 1:1:1:1 ) . For allocation participant , `` Randomization.com '' online , randomisation web service use ( http : //www.randomization.com/ ) . Simple randomisation procedure ( computerized random number ) do sequentially numbered index card random assignment prepared investigator clinical involvement study . The index card fold place sealed opaque envelope . Then , blind investigator open envelope allocate participant group accord select index card . The intervention perform physiotherapist university research clinic , assessment data collection make another therapist . Whereas interventionist aware allocate arm , patient outcome assessor kept blind allocation . The data evaluate use Statistical Package Social Sciences 21.0 program Windows analyze descriptive statistic ( frequency , mean standard deviation ) . Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test use assess distribution data . The one-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) repeat measure Bonferroni post hoc test use determine whether difference mean score outcome measure among three time point ( baseline , immediate 24 hour later ) study group . In study , p value less 0.05 regard statistically significant .</detailed_description>
