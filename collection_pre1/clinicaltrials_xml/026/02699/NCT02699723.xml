	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well arsenic trioxide itraconazole work treat patient basal cell cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , arsenic trioxide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Itraconazole may help treat fungal infection patient basal cell cancer . Giving arsenic trioxide itraconazole may work well treat basal cell cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response arsenic trioxide/itraconazole patient refractory basal cell carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine treatment associate reduction Gli messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) level tumor and/or normal skin biopsy sample , compare baseline level . OUTLINE : Patients receive arsenic trioxide orally ( PO ) itraconazole PO daily 50 day , follow maintenance therapy consist 2 week treatment 2 week treatment 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
