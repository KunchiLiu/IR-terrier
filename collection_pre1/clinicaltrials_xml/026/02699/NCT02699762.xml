	<brief_title>Upper Limb Botulinum Toxin Injection Combined With Self Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following stroke , 30 % patient leave `` hemiplegic '' upper limb mean unable carry movement limb thus partially totally dependent activity daily live ( dress , wash , feed etc ) . Another 40 % proximal recovery . These patient able carry movement shoulder sometimes elbow . They use limb activity daily live carry bag stabilise paper writing . The last 30 % recover certain degree prehension , however motor control alter impairment reach grasping phase . Treatment chronic stroke symptom ( 6 month post-onset ) include impairment activity limitation mostly base physiotherapy botulinum toxin injection ( BTI ) . Physiotherapy : This treatment show effective , essential reduce impairment improve function patient hemiparesis follow stroke ( Robertson et al , 2008 ; Bourgeais et al , 2010 ) . Different method exist , comparative study common one show similar effectiveness ( Adal et al , 2006 ; Flansbjer et al , 2008 ; Brazzelli et al , 2011 , Durstine et al 2009 ) . No conventional treatment show effective another . However , demonstrate intensity specificity rehabilitation technique positively correlate motor recovery ( Gordon et al , 2004 ) . Intensity rehabilitation : In 2006 , meta-analysis 21 study effect muscle strengthen post stroke show improved active function activity daily live ( measure different scale ) follow acute chronic stroke ( Ada et al , 2006 ) . Currently , meta-analysis Brazzelli et al . ( 2011 ) contain large collection data , 32 study total 1414 participant . The study include subject cardiovascular training , muscle strengthen mixed training ( cardiovascular+strength ) . The main outcome measure incidence mortality degree dependence disability . The result show improvement follow cardiovascular train mixed training . Strength train alone significantly improve mobility . These result lead American College Sport Medicine recommend endurance strength training couple stretch stroke patient . Task-oriented training : Carr et Shepherd ( 1998 ) first promote task orient training . More recently , Van de port et al , ( 2009-2012 ) evaluate 250 patient follow 12 week task-oriented circuit training ( 126 patient ) conventional physiotherapy ( 124 patient ) . All patient least 6 month post stroke . The training consist 6-minute work station 8 different exercise , rise chair reach different target , pick object floor walking , kick ball , cross obstacle , ascend descend stairs etc . Greater improvement occur task-oriented group six-minute walk test Stair test ( time ascend descend flight 10 stair . Another meta-analysis ( include 307 participant ) demonstrate task-oriented training improve distance walk , gait speed Timed Up Go test ( rise chair , walk 3 metre , turn return sit ) ( Wevers et al , 2009 ) . These result show train involve practice specific function improve . Botulinum toxin injection : Botulinum toxin neurotoxin produce clostridium botulinum bacteria . Seven different serotypes exist A B serotypes use clinical practice . Botulinum toxin block presynaptic release neurotransmitter neuromuscular junction . Focal transitory paralysis thus occurs injected muscle . Its action last average 3 month striate skeletal muscle . The effect BTI upper limb depend parameter study . A meta-analysis carry Foley et al , 2013 show relatively large effect size reduction impairment improvement passive function . However , small effect size improvement function prehension . This confirm result previous study ( Sheean et al , 2010 ) show effect BTI upper limb significant reduction impairment improvement passive function , active function . These result confirm study use goal attainment scale outcome measure ( Turner Stokes et al , 2010 ) . Following BTI upper limb hemiparetic patient , significant improvement goal attainment scale score , moreover , strongly correlate reduction spasticity evaluate Ashworth scale ( widely use scale evaluation spasticity ) . The result also show goal often attain involved improvement passive function active function . The study show improvement prehension follow BTI involved combine treatment constraint induce therapy ( Sun et al , 2010 ) . Self-rehabilitation Two recent study show rehabilitation couple BTI could significant effect activity limitation : A pilot randomise control trial 35 patient spastic hemiparesis Roche et al ( 2014 ) show 30-minute , daily self-rehabilitation program couple single session BTI low limb significantly improve several gait-related activity . The self-rehabilitation program develop combine different type exercise include : ) strengthen hip flexor extensors triceps sural ; ii ) stretch rectus femoris , hamstring triceps sural iii ) task-oriented gait-related exercise include obstacle cross slalom . They show significantly great improvement experimental group control group maximal gait speed 10-metre walk test , distance walk 6-minute walk test time ascend descend flight stair . Sun et al ( 2010 ) carry randomise control trial include 32 patient stroke . They show constraint-induced therapy paretic upper limb couple BTI significantly improve prehension reduce spasticity finger wrist flexor BTI couple standard therapy . In summary Together , result indicate addition self-rehabilitation program botulinum toxin injection pertinent method optimise effect BTI usual therapy . However , study yet evaluate effect addition self-rehabilitation program treatment BTI usual therapy . Moreover , correspond public health issue provide great intensity rehabilitation within constraint health system , include lack funding lack physiotherapist train type specialise rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
