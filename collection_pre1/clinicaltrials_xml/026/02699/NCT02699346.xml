	<brief_summary>The HeadSense ( HS ) HS-1000 device , new non-invasive brain monitor expect safely accurately monitor concuss patient minimal discomfort , potentially provide new modality concussion measurement . The device base advanced signal analysis algorithm analyze low frequency acoustic signal ( within audible range ) generate device . The acoustic signal transmit use small transmitter , place participant 's ear , pick acoustic sensor place ear .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation HS-1000 Device Capabilities Diagnosis Assessment Patients After Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concussion diagnosis assessment suffers lack gold-standard measurement , leave physician rely physical neurological examination , neurocognitive/mental status testing , balance examination , time-consuming influenced subjective factor . In order address significant drawback , need novel modality diagnose monitor concussion quick easy-to-use non-invasive manner . Based previous analysis physiological process use acoustic signal collect analyze far , hypothesis HS-1000 capable diagnose monitoring concuss patient , base acoustic raw data derive generated acoustic signal along analysis acoustic signal derive physiological process brain . These process , e.g . cerebral blood-flow respiratory cycle , impaired change intracranial pressure ( ICP ) hypothesize change well patient concuss . Concussed athlete identify routine visit Vanderbilt Sports Concussion Center . Controls identify among non-concussed athlete see Vanderbilt Sports Medicine offer participation . After sign informed consent , healthy subject patient undergo screen assessment study . Eligible patient healthy subject enrol study HS-1000 headset portion device place ear . HS-1000 monitoring interval last 20 minute continuously . Following completion data collection , HS-1000 remove . Safety evaluation include monitor adverse event throughout study . The study duration patient 1 hour . Healthy subject undergo two recording approximately two week apart . Post-concussion patient multiple session : - Session # 1 Baseline record soon possible - Session # 2 48 hour session # 1 - Session # 3 1 week session # 1 - Session # 4 1 month session # 1</detailed_description>
