	<brief_title>In Vivo Measurements Nasal Ciliary Beat Frequency Using Interferometry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Mucociliary clearance airway depend ciliary movement ciliated cell cover entire airway sinus . In many airway disease mucociliary clearance affect injury cause smoke , virus , infectious organism genetic disease call Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia ( PCD ) . The diagnosis PCD base combination clinical finding bronchiectasis , chronic sinusitis , chronic otitis medium immotile sperm . In addition , test perform pulmonary laboratory nasal nitric oxide level may low . Samples obtain nasal brush biopsy analyze ciliary movement record video microscopy . Ciliary beat frequency ( CBF ) calculate freshly isolate sample also grow tissue cell culture . Furthermore , ciliated cell analyze electron microscopy detect defect microscopic structure cilium . The major problem encounter assay perform vitro condition natural environment cell acidity ( pH ) , temperature , electrolytes etc . may different . Moreover , genetic testing limited mutation know cause PCD , rule mutation yet discover . Therefore method need unequivocally measure ciliary movement natural environment . Goal 1 . Assessment high speed video camera green light source measurement ciliary beat frequency ( CBF ) nasal airways patient . 2 . Assessments effect drug therapy CBF use study system . Methods The protocol approve local Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Hadassah Medical Center , Jerusalem , Israel Equipment : 1 . High Speed High Video Microscope build specification need study base commercially available high speed video system . 2 . The green light source ( LED ) use consist spot 3mm diameter energy 10 milli Watt ( equal 1Kilowatt/square meter ) 3 . Video camera ( manufacture SONY Inc , Japan ) Patients : Patients refer ciliary brush biopsy ask sign inform consent enrol study . Patients examine high speed digital video camera place close nasal cavity order photograph area interest . The camera lens focus reflect light nasal mucosa record . This reflect light record analyzed obtain CBF , heart rate respiratory rate . After record patient proceed nasal brush ciliary biopsy . The cell analyze CBF calculate several area smear . Safety measure : All participate patient wear protective cover eye photography .</detailed_description>
