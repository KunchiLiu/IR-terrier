	<detailed_description>Femoral neck fracture represent half hip fracture divide displace undisplaced fracture . Displaced femoral neck fracture almost always treat surgically arthroplasty . However ongoing debate implant superior undisplaced fracture . A novel implant design ( Pinloc ) develop Swemac Innovation AB . While original implant consist 2 isolated hook pin , modify design consist 3 titanium hook pin interlocked aluminum plate . Interlocking new principle implant design improve fixation load transfer amongst pin . The superiority modify design far proven preclinically . The role Pinloc clinical use remain unclear . A series study plan Oslo University Hospital collaboration Diakonhjemmet Hospital hope clarify debate . The use Pinloc introduce region ( e.g . Norway , Sweden Japan ) . The role Pinloc remain unclear little publish 's use , even though believe important contributor stability fixation . Femoral neck fracture mainly cause fall height elderly . The fracture often classify displace , use simplify Garden classification . Several classification system also exist , show reliable clinical usefulness . The ideal classification system easily applicable , reliable , aid treatment decision make prognosis . The treatment femoral neck fracture comprise perioperative operative modality . The perioperative modality consist among others medical optimalization preoperatively , early rehabilitation prevention new fracture treat osteoporosis prevent new fall . The main scope current study , however , operative modality . Surgery undsiplaced femoral neck fracture perform mainly internal fixation traction table , use either screw , pin slide hip screw ( SHS ) , available various design different manufacturer . The late Cochrane review conclude implant superior . Radiostereometry ( RSA ) precise accurate method measure motion vivo different segment orthopaedic research . To , radioopaque tantalum marker implant bone define different segment . Stereoradiographs perform time detect movement monitor healing ( non heal ) process . This movement calculate translation rotation . They ideal describe compare stability fracture system . RSA use successfully early study fracture heal . Due high accuracy precision , RSA yield reliable result relatively small study-groups . Investigators plan use RSA measure fracture dislocation time heal study . The study function Pinloc itÂ´s ability prevent secondary dislocation undisplaced femoral neck fracture . Investigators utilize RSA measurement follow-up .</detailed_description>
