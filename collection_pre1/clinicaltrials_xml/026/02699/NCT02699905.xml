	<brief_summary>This study seek elucidate quantitative expression G - protein receptor 43/free fatty acid ( GPR43/FFA2 ) receptors patient diagnosis sepsis specifically , expression relate severity sepsis . The investigator hypothesize patient severe sepsis , define high SOFA ( Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score ) , decrease expression GPR43/FFA2 compare patient low SOFA score , consistent less exuberant immune response infection . Patients admit Penn State Hershey Medical Center diagnosis sepsis cause undergo blood test leukocyte determine express quantity GP43 standardize time point illness recovery . No intervention make standard clinical management patient . Additionally , healthy volunteer recruit exam baseline GPR43 receptor expression sepsis control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neutrophil FFA2/GPR43 Receptor Expression Patients With Diagnosis Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advancement recognition treatment , sepsis continue frequently fatal condition comprise 750,000 case US estimate death rate 28-38 % . Bacterial sepsis complication result cascade inflammatory mediator secondary immune system 's recognition response invade bacteria , intracellular constituent metabolite . Bacterial recognition result widespread activation biological mediator essential immune response cytokine , chemokines , prostaglandin reactive oxygen specie . These compound result activation up-regulation neutrophil , monocyte cellular level well physiological change sepsis hyperpyrexia , vasodilation , tachycardia . Despite generally coordinate response , likely mark complication relate sequela uncontrolled immune response lead significant injury lung ( Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ) , organ ( acute renal failure , shock liver ) . In addition , question impairment gut mucosal barrier may result translocation bacteria perpetuate multiple organ failure . G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCRs ) comprise one large collection transmembrane protein mammalian genome . Recently , subfamily G protein couple receptor identify utilize short chain free fatty acid ligand , FFA1 ( GPR40 ) , FFA2 ( GPR43 ) FFA3 ( GPR41 ) . Research intimate receptor involve essential biological crosstalk colonic bacteria , host immune defense . Although highly conserved structure , member sub family demonstrate difference fatty acid specificity , intracellular signal mechanisms tissue localization . Specifically , FFA2 ( GPR43 ) 4 expression show express high magnitude within immune cell , hypothesize involved modulation pro- anti-inflammatory mediator , prostaglandin E2 involve neutrophil chemotaxis mouse . GPR43 involve process differentiation progenitor immune cell monocytes macrophage , key component host defense . In addition , highly selective expression GPR43 polymorphonuclear cell point strong role chemotaxis recruitment immune cell foci bacterial infection . Short chain fatty acid also activate GPR43 receptor intestinal epithelial cell rapid production secondary chemokine cytokine challenge inflammation infection , likely aid coordinate immune response . GP43 likely essential component phagocytic chemotaxis maintain normal intestinal immune defense . In model acute colitis , GPR43 knockout mouse demonstrate increased mortality . The author conclude GPR43 deficiency likely suppress role immune cell within gut immune milieu lead death sepsis related complication . Conversely , chronic colitis model , GPR43 deficient knockout mouse demonstrate reduced colonic inflammation , without overwhelm infection , author conclude GPR43 unfavorable role manifestation chronic inflammatory condition . These finding confirm least one late study . In human , fetal membrane expression GPR43 high parturients preterm labor sign infection .</detailed_description>
