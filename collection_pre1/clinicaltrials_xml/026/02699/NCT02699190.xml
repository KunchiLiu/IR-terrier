	<brief_title>LeukoSEQ : Whole Genome Sequencing First-Line Diagnostic Tool Leukodystrophies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The leukodystrophies heterogeneous group inherit disorder broad clinical manifestation variable pathologic mechanism . Leukodystrophies group approximately 30 genetic disease primarily affect white matter central nervous system ( CNS ) remain diagnostic challenge clinician researcher . As whole , leukodystrophies relatively common ( approximately 1 7000 birth ) . This genetically heterogeneous set disorder categorize base initial finding white matter abnormality CNS . Historically , abnormality identify use gross pathology . More recently , neuroimagery use diagnostic purpose . However , half suspected leukodystrophies definitive diagnosis , classify `` leukodystrophies unknown etiology '' . Even diagnosis achieve , diagnostic process last average eight year result test expense excess $ 8,000 average per patient , include majority patient never achieve diagnosis . These diagnostic challenge represent urgent unresolved gap knowledge disease characterization , obtain definitive diagnosis paramount importance leukodystrophy patient . The diagnostic workup begin finding cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) follow sequential target genetic testing , however next generation sequence technology ( NGS ) offer promise rapid cost effective approach . In general , NGS potential revolutionize medical research diagnostics , particularly rare disease - 80 % genetic origin . In last two year , pace discovery increase remarkable rate due use whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) whole exome sequencing ( WES ) . Recent report suggest WES yield insight previously ambiguous rare genetic disorder . For example , large-scale WES project use identify new nosologic entity use clinical molecular data adult onset leukodystrophy , neurodevelopmental disorder , epilepsy/ epileptic encephalopathy , degenerative ataxia , intellectual disability . In clinical setting , WES also show provide diagnosis atypical presentation establish disorder . Overall , diagnostic yield large disease cohort range 16-53 % . Despite advance diagnostic efficacy , still significant issue respect implementation NGS clinical setting . Given unmet diagnostic need amongst patient persistently unresolved white matter disorder , potential agnostic NGS test clarify case , investigator propose randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) 200 leukodystrophy patient time initial confirmation MRI abnormality , prospective collection patient randomly receive `` first come , first serve '' basis network expert clinical site . All participant undergo WGS parallel standard clinical testing staggered fashion . The WGS testing perform clinical service laboratory certify Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) College American Pathologists ( CAP ) . This approach aim assess diagnostic validity utility NGS approach , primary outcome measure include time diagnosis whether diagnosis achieve . The investigator anticipate result study serve pilot similar approach rare disease cohort , ultimately help establish utility WGS first-line diagnostic tool patient suspect genetic condition .</detailed_description>
