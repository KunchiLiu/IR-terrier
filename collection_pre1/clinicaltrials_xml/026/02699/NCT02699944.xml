	<brief_title>Optimization CRT Using ECG Vest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) one important advance treatment patient heart failure ( HF ) . This therapy , also know biventricular pacing , utilizes pacemaker lead synchronize contraction wall within left ventricle ( LV ) contraction leave right ventricle . Many randomized trial conclusively demonstrate CRT improves symptom , LV structure function , hospitalization rate , survival appropriately select HF patient . Nonetheless , approximately 30 % CRT patient `` non-responders '' demonstrate expect clinical and/or echocardiographic improvement follow therapy . A critical component assess CRT efficacy optimization clinic use novel method body surface electrocardiographic mapping development Medtronic , call ECG Vest . In proposal , describe research study ass potential benefit use ECG Vest part CRT optimization strategy clinical echocardiographic outcome ( heart size function ) patient receive standard clinical care UHVC CRT Optimization Clinic .</detailed_description>
