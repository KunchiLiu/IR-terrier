	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine use Provodine antiseptic hand wash daily least 7 day well healing , good health outcome , few treatment failure few infection among household contact use Provodine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skin Soft Tissue Infection ( SSTI ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients meet criterion study enrol convenience sample randomize treatment group . Each patient demographic data sheet complete one study investigator research associate . The data sheet include contact information , age , gender , ethnicity , location abscess , measure length width palpable fluctuance induration , measure length width surround cellulitis , presence absence fever , previous medical history ( include history prior skin abscess . ) Assignment treatment group block randomization . All enrol patient provide informed consent document overview study . Baseline measurement include size abscess ( measure ruler palpable fluctuance induration ) maximal diameter large area cellulitis record . Providers outline area palpable fluctuance Aspen skin marker delineate surround area cellulitis dot line establish baseline surface area wound . All patient standard care include incision drainage wound culture abscess cavity . All patient receive local anesthesia additional pain management leave discretion treat provider . Providers make linear incision length palpable fluctuance induration . The provider explore wound cavity break apart loculations allow adequate drainage purulent discharge . The provider obtain wound culture irrigate normal saline clear irrigation fluid drain cavity . Swabs sub-cultured blood agar plat grown overnight bacterial identification antibiotic susceptibility test . Patients randomized Provodine abscess cavity surround skin gently paint Provodine solution . The content one foil packet Provodine apply Q-tip wall floor abscess cavity . The content second foil packet apply surround skin within 5 cm around incision . The abscess cavity group gently pack Â¼ inch plain gauze strip wind cover 4x4 gauze secure tape . Patients instructed leave wind packing place change outer dress day return 48-72 hour first wind recheck . Several study show clinical benefit antibiotic routine management uncomplicated abscess . Patients uncomplicated abscess ( define palpable abscess &lt; 5 cm healthy patient history diabetes , HIV , IVDA immunocompromised state systemic sign infection ) treat antibiotic . Patients meet criterion treat antibiotic discretion provider . A study investigator evaluate patient emergency department clinic within 48- 72 hour initial follow visit pack remove . Patients randomized Provodine content foil packet reapplied wall abscess cavity surround skin . Data collect initial recheck include presence absence fever , purulent drainage , erythema , pain , well presence new skin lesion . A new lesion define new abscess , pustule , carbuncle , furuncle least 5 cm away initial wound . Lesions within 5 cm initial wound consider failure initial abscess treatment . Study investigator also record compliance intervention side effect . Compliance assess measure amount open foil packet patient report . The cure rate , measure absence fever , pain , erythema purulent discharge , record well overall assessment provider wound improving , unchanged , clinically worsen . Wound management leave discretion treat provider , incision drainage , wound repacking antibiotic use reserve patient determine clinically improve get bad consider treatment failure . Outcomes include clinical cure , rate new lesion development patient HCs , therapeutic change clinical management record . After pack remove , patient instruct cleanse abscess home soaking water day gently pat wound dry . Patients follow specific instruction wound management day wash . After cleanse dry abscess , patient randomize Provodine arm wash hand soap water , pat dry , apply content one foil packet Provodine dorsum palmar aspects hand finger rub hand finger together one minute ensure skin distal wrist cover . They apply content second foil packet wall floor abscess cavity use Q tip applicator . The patient apply third foil packet Provodine skin surround abscess within 5 cm diameter wound use separate Q tip . After apply Provodine abscess surround skin , gently rinse hand water , pat hand dry , cover wound 4x4 gauze dressing . The patient also instruct keep sealable bag empty Provodine foil packet assess compliance follow visit . Patients randomized standard care cover wind 4x4 gauze dress wash hand soap water one minute . Patients instructed continue perform daily cleansing/treatments see second wound recheck wound cavity close . The patient return 2nd visit 7 10 day second wound recheck . Data collect initial recheck include presence absence fever , purulent drainage , erythema , pain , well presence new skin abscesses patient HCs . Study investigator also record compliance intervention side effect . Compliance assess measure amount open foil packet patient report . The cure rate , measure absence fever , pain , erythema purulent discharge , record . Wound management leave discretion treat provider , incision drainage , wound repacking antibiotic use encourage patient determine clinically improve get bad consider treatment failure . Outcomes include clinical cure , reinfection , rate new lesion development , therapeutic change clinical management record . Patients call home 30 day assess treatment failure require additional intervention new lesion development patient HCs . Outcomes include rate clinical cure rate initial abscess rate new lesion development . Therapeutic change ( e.g. , addition new antibiotic additional incision drainage ) , unplanned health care encounter skin infection ( e.g. , urgent care visit , emergent care visit , hospital admission ) consider treatment failure . Fisher 's exact test use compare outcomes group . Continuously distribute outcomes summarized sample size , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum , categorical outcome summarize frequency percentage . The number screen , number screen failure reason , number randomize , number lose follow-up reason number complete study treatment group tabulate . Treatment group contrast regard cure ( yes , ) , new lesion ( yes , ) , infection ( yes , ) Fisher 's Exact test . Adverse event , , list treatment group case number indicator seriousness ( serious , serious ) , severity ( mild , moderate , severe ) , relation treatment ( related treatment , unknown related treatment ) . All statistical test two-sided significance level 5 % . The sample size derive statistical power calculation motivate pilot nature study .
