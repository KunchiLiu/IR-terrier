	<brief_title>Locomotor Training With Exoskeleton EKSO-GT Patients With Incomplete Motor Spinal Cord Injury Hospital Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The locomotor training , define `` therapeutic program aim recovery walk intense practice task walk '' , important part treatment plan patient locomotor dysfunction low extremity aim retrain nervous system , facilitate recovery muscle strength , improve balance voluntary motor coordination . In fact , majority gait rehabilitation strategy base concept plasticity Central Nervous System `` Central Pattern Generator '' : plasticity suppose facilitate early , intensive specific therapy , able enhance natural recovery process . The final goal help patient regain high level personal autonomy consequently translate also well overall quality life . The anthropomorphic robotic exoskeleton EKSO ( Ekso Bionics , USA ) design assist upright , weight bear ground gait train people weakness paralysis lower limb , due disorder , disease neurologic injury . The training EKSO possible even presence minimal forearm strength order rest upfront mobile walker . The device available market year recently introduce clinical practice Italian rehabilitative center . Montecatone Rehabilitation Institute acquire recent `` GT '' version EKSO enable variable , adaptive assistance . This observational , longitudinal research study descriptive/exploratory intent . It aim describe response rehabilitative training robotic exoskeleton EKSO-GT cohort incomplete motor Spinal Cord Injury patient ( AIS C D ) , rehabilitative tool set intensive inpatient rehabilitation ( 3rd level hospital ) . Safety tolerability also assess describe . This kind study justify fact although global network professional user agree potential `` young '' technology rehabilitation outcome , clinical data publish scientific literature relation use . It believe result obtain study useful future definition well protocol use exoskeleton , specific different type SCI people . Primary objective : describe response robotic ground gait train EKSO-GT inpatient rehabilitative hospital setting , people incomplete motor SCI ( AIS C D ) . This objective achieve mean administration walk test assessment low limb motor function kinetic endurance characteristic walk . Secondary objective , description patient ' population : - Safety tolerability locomotor train EKSO-GT ; - Level strength muscle trophism patient subject robotic training ; - Any reduction pain and/or spasticity due SCI locomotor train EKSO-GT ; - Quality life mood status patient ; - Level patient satisfaction relation gait train EKSO-GT ; - Maintenance acquire benefit ( follow-up 45 day conclusion train EKSO-GT ) , respect outcome take account . All functional assessment carry patient wear exoskeleton ; however , functional gait specific test ( 10-meter walk test 6-minutes walk test ) perform exoskeleton worn worn patient able accomplish gait specific test way . For gait specific test first evaluation exoskeleton worn program third robotic rehabilitative session , first session necessary set-up purpose . Data safety tolerability EKSO-GT training record begin end session , however synthesis safety outcome carry predefine time frame . The training EKSO-GT carry addition `` conventional '' locomotor train presence specifically trained physiotherapist , always medical supervision . Patients undergo 12 18 rehabilitative EKSO session , 2-3 time per week , max 1 hr .</detailed_description>
