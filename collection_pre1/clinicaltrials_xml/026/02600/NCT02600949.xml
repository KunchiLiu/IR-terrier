	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn possible make vaccine advance pancreatic colorectal cancer . The safety vaccine also study . This study use tumor cell ( either fresh biopsy leftover tissue sample ) blood help create vaccine design specifically base study doctor research staff learn type mutate protein ( type genetic change ) tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peptide Vaccine Advanced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Colorectal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue Collection : Within 4 week sign informed consent document , part screen test : - You leftover frozen tissue collect create vaccine , available . If enough frozen tissue available , leftover tissue recent procedure perform part standard care collect . The study study staff may ask take part another MD Anderson clinical research study ( PA15-0176 ) collection leftover tissue . The study doctor discus , decide take part , sign separate inform consent document . After tissue cell collect , vaccine make . The vaccine also make blood cell . If agree , consent enrolled separate protocol , PA14-0138 , leukapheresis procedure perform . Leukapheresis special type blood draw procedure separate red blood cell , white blood cell , part blood . The consent form protocol explain leukapheresis procedure perform risk . The white blood cell collect leukapheresis use study . Baseline Tests : You must receive least 1 type chemotherapy enrol study first dose vaccine . There limit number type chemotherapy may receive . Your study doctor decide enter treatment part study . Within 28 day last dose chemotherapy : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . The routine blood draw include pregnancy test become pregnant . Within 14 day first dose vaccine , MRI CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis . Study Vaccine Administration : About 28 day last dose chemotherapy , receive vaccine injection skin Day 1 Weeks 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 . Imiquimod cream apply injection site 30 minute receive vaccine . This do time receive vaccine . Study Visits : On Day 1 Weeks 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine test test genetic mutation . - During Week 6 , MRI CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis . On Day 1 Weeks 12 20 , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw test genetic mutation . On Day 1 Week 16 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You may receive vaccine 9 week . You may able continue receive vaccine Week 9 , disease stable appear get well . The study doctor discus . You longer able receive study vaccine disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up . End-of-Study Visit : About 8 week last study visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Follow-Up : You call 2 time study staff 6 month last dose vaccine ask side effect may experience since end-of-study visit . Each call last 10 minute . If leave study side effect , call study staff side effect go away become stable . This investigational study . The study vaccine FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain vaccine design work . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ( PDA ) metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) eligible . ( PDA patient elevate tumor marker follow primary pancreatic surgery would eligible ) . 2 . Patients line ( include zero ) prior therapy sign consent prior tissue harvest . Vaccination take place patient offer failed curative therapy either PDA CRC . Vaccination take place least one line standard chemotherapy give . 3 . Patients must adequate fresh frozen tissue available . If tissue need , subject may collect protocol PA150176 . 4 . Age =/ &gt; 18 year . 5 . ECOG performance status &lt; 1 ( Karnofsky &gt; 70 % ) 6 . Life expectancy great 6 month . 7 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : : ) leukocytes =/ &gt; 3,000/mcL ; b ) absolute neutrophil count =/ &gt; 1,000/mcL ; c ) platelets =/ &gt; 75,000/mcL ; ) total bilirubin =/ &lt; 2.0 X institutional upper limit normal ; e ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) =/ &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( except gilbert disease direct bilirubin use ) ; f ) creatinine clearance =/ &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 8 . Patients must demonstrate ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 9 . The effect peptide base vaccine develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Birth control specification : unless surgically sterile bilateral tubal ligation vasectomy partner ( ) , sexually active participant must use birth control 1 month study . Acceptable form birth control include condom , diaphragm , hormonal , IUD , sponge plus spermicide . Abstinence also acceptable form birth control . 10 . Inclusion criterion prior first vaccination ( within 21 day ) addition inclusion criterion unless specify differently : ECOG performance status =/ &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky =/ &gt; 60 % ) 11 . Inclusion criterion prior first vaccination ( within 21 day ) : Life expectancy great 4 month 12 . Inclusion criterion prior first vaccination ( within 21 day ) : Patients must measurable evaluable disease per RECIST v1.1 . 1 . Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential lack efficacy therapeutic cancer vaccine . 2 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 3 . Known history chronic hepatitis B hepatitis C virus chronic infection . 4 . Subjects active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . 5 . Subjects condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . 6 . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Women child bear potential pregnant breastfeeding . Women positive pregnancy test enrollment prior administration vaccine . 8 . Exclusion criterion prior first vaccination ( within 21 day ) addition exclusion criterion unless specify differently : Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study recover baseline adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier ( washout period ) . 9 . Exclusion criterion prior first vaccination ( within 21 day ) addition exclusion criterion unless specify differently : Women child bear potential pregnant breastfeeding . Women positive pregnancy test prior administration vaccine . 10 . Exclusion criterion prior first vaccination ( within 21 day ) addition exclusion criterion unless specify differently : Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 11 . Exclusion criterion prior first vaccination ( within 21 day ) addition exclusion criterion unless specify differently : Patients may receive investigational agent .</criteria>
