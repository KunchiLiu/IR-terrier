	<brief_summary>Outpatient ( phase 2 ) pulmonary rehab important , mostly underutilized intervention improve physical function patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) . Of individual complete phase 2 pulmonary rehab , small cohort continue type maintenance exercise therapy ( phase 3 ) . This largely due personal factor , access transportation , weather , schedule difficulty , cost . Little known enhance physical activity among patient IPF . In addition , study investigate long-term maintenance strategy physical training patient IPF . Thus , purpose study test feasibility effectiveness home-based , pulmonary rehab program patient IPF . A randomized , blind , clinical trial ( RCT ) design two arm -- Wii Fit Plus exergame program cognitive video gaming , active whole body movement involve — use investigate benefit home-based exergame program improve pulmonary-related function symptom patient IPF .</brief_summary>
