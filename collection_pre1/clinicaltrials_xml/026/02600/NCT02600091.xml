The participant allocate wait list control group receive MBCT intervention 6 month intervention group complete MBCT programme . The investigator recruit participant use poster leaflet , word mouth diabetes professional , write eligible . All method simply raise awareness study . The intervention require considerable commitment participant ( indicate ) fully explain explore . It potential participant make initial contact research team , point invite diabetes outpatient clinic discussion project entail , nature mindfulness , go usual consent procedure . In case people agree participate , investigator write GP diabetes consultant let know patient enrol study , provide brief information project . The MBCT intervention manualised deliver group . The aim MBCT intervention increase mindfulness skill facilitate use relation emotional wellbeing diabetes self-management . Participants attend 8 occasion , per week , 2 hour . These meeting standard structure . First , participant describe effort practice mindfulness home previous week , follow discussion educational topic relevant aim course .

Moreover , investigator request detail frequency severe hypoglycaemia ( define occasion need help correct blood glucose level ) ; mild-moderate ( self-corrected ) hypoglycaemia , number admission diabetic ketoacidosis 6 month precede begin MBCT course period end treatment follow-up . The investigator record baseline HbA1c value obtain 6 month follow-up point . Finally , participant ask keep diary health care use ( example , GP visit ; call diabetes specialist nurse ; visit secondary care diabetes health professional , ) previous 6 month baseline follow-up . In addition , NHS Scotland ; NHS Grampian , NHS Glasgow electronic system ( eg , SCI-Diabetes SCI-Store ) use obtain accurate account contact secondary health profession .

Interviews conduct participant locate Aberdeen Glasgow . These semi-structured interview focus patient ' view volunteer ; expectation intervention ; acceptability intervention measure ; perceive benefit , difficulty experience participation . The investigator also keen hear thought key characteristic facilitator ; best attract potential participant future definitive trial , way overcome pragmatic difficulty , experience . The investigator also attempt contact study drop-outs brief ( 5-10 minute ) telephone interview reason drop-out . This include drop prior participation group , drop group session , complete group participation fail complete follow-up measure . Consent contact reason obtain entry study prove acceptable current MBCT feasibility study use volunteer recruit . Analysis qualitative data theoretically informed Normalisation Process Theory ( NPT ) specifically address identification barrier facilitator up-take intervention process change . Standard demographic information include socio-economic status collect co-existence condition ( co-morbidity ) . The investigator also record standard diabetes health information time since diagnosis ; complication present , change medication baseline follow-up . The Scottish Index Multiple Deprivation ( SIMD ) ascertain participant ' postcode . The study end date last data collect .</detailed_description>
