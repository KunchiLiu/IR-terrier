Another outcome measure ability subject maintain balance</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Attention Level Due Isometric Exercises Level Three Progression Eccentric Movements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On Day 1 , subject complete mental speed test undergo CDP test use modified Clinical Testing Sensory Integration Balance ( mCTSIB ) protocol : subject require stand hard compliant surface ( 4 '' tall foam cushion know mechanical property ) comfortable posture , foot shoulder width , eye open close , head straight arm side free move , gaze forward , breathe normally . These constitute baseline information . Subjects divide two group : isometric group ( perform isometric exercise ) eccentric group ( perform eccentric exercise ) . At end Day 1 , isometric group perform isometric exercise eccentric group act control ( exercise ) . On Day 2 , subject complete mental speed test undergo CDP test second time . These constitute first follow-up information . At end Day 2 , eccentric group perform eccentric exercise isometric group act control ( exercise ) . Throughout Day 3 , subject complete mental speed test undergo CDP test third time . This constitute second last follow-up information .</detailed_description>
