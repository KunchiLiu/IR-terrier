The interventionists integrate aging-service agency ; hence , integrate tele-PST ( IT-PST ) ad integrate tele-SCM ( IT-SCM ) .

The analysis include ( ) comparison delivery cost IT-PST IT-SCM ; ( b ) assessment cost-effectiveness ( CEA ) base DFDs health-related quality adjust life-year measure EuroQol-5 ( EQ-5D ) ; ( 3 ) budget impact ( BIA ) IT-PST relative IT-SCM .
