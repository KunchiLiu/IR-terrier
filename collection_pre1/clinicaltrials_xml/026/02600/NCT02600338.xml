	<brief_summary>Legumes generally recognize healthy dietary component , although bean legume recommend food guideline North America , guideline vary regard much often foods consume . Furthermore , although North American European guideline recommend dietary pulse glycemic control , dietary pulse legumes specifically suggest control blood pressure maintain heart health . To improve evidence-based guidance legume recommendation , investigator propose conduct systematic review clinical study assess effect eat legume exchange food blood pressure human . The systematic review process allow combine result many small study order arrive pool estimate , similar weighted average , true effect . The investigator able explore whether eat legumes different effect different demographic , whether effect legumes depend much/often eaten . The finding propose knowledge synthesis help improve health Canadians inform recommendation general public , well risk heart disease diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Legumes ( e.g . chick pea , bean , lentil , pea , soy , peanut , lupin ) source slowly digestible carbohydrate , vegetable protein , fibre , potassium . Canada 's Food Guide encourage consumption legume bean , lentil , tofu `` often '' meat alternative , dietary guideline Americans include bean , pea , soy product `` food increase '' , possible component healthy eating pattern . While European ( EASD ) , Canadian ( CDA ) , American ( ADA ) Diabetes Associations recommend consumption dietary pulse mean improve diabetes control , American Heart Association ( AHA ) recommend consumption healthy eating pattern include legume cardiovascular health , consolidated evidence specific recommendation legume heart health lacking . Need review : The lack data support health claim cardiometabolic recommendation represent urgent call strong evidence . A systematic review meta-analysis control feeding trial remain `` Gold Standard '' evidence nutrition guideline development . Objectives : To provide evidence-based guidance public health policy , health claim , nutrition guideline relate legume , investigator conduct systematic review meta-analysis ( knowledge synthesis ) randomize control feeding trial assess effect legume blood pressure . Design : The planning conduct propose meta-analyses follow Cochrane handbook systematic review intervention . The reporting follow Preferred Reporting Items Systematic review Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials search use appropriate search term . Study selection : Intervention trial investigate diet high legume compare control diet not-containing legume blood pressure outcome human include . Studies &lt; 3-wks duration lack control exclude . Data extraction : Independent reviewer ( ≥2 ) extract information study design , sample size , subject characteristic , type form legume , dose , follow-up , composition background diet . Mean±SEM value extract outcomes . Standard computation imputation use derive miss variance data . Outcomes : The propose analysis ass blood pressure control , look systolic , diastolic , mean arterial blood pressure . Where data change-from-baseline difference end difference equally available , investigator use difference change baseline primary end point analysis . Data synthesis : Pooled analysis stratify underlying disease status conduct area metabolic control use Generic Inverse Variance method fixed random effect model , depend number relevant study obtain . Random-effects model use case collection 5 study , even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity test Cochran Q statistic quantify I2-statistic . Sources heterogeneity explore sensitivity subgroup analyse . A priori subgroup analysis include legume type , legume dose , duration follow-up , sodium intake ( absolute level , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , dietary fibre intake ( absolute level , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , design ( crossover , parallel ) , study quality , baseline endpoint value . Significant unexplained heterogeneity investigate additional post hoc subgroup analyse . Meta-regression analysis assess significance subgroup analysis . When &gt; =10 study available , publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot formal test use Egger test Begg test . If publication bias suspect , investigator attempt adjust funnel plot asymmetry impute miss study data use Duval Tweedie trim fill method . Evidence Assessment : The strength evidence outcome assess use Grading Recommendations Assessment , Development Evaluation ( GRADE ) . Knowledge translation plan : Results disseminate traditional mean interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Target adopter include clinical practice , public health , industry , research community , patient group . Feedback incorporate use guide area future research . Preliminary finding : The investigator previously conduct systematic review meta-analysis effect dietary pulse ( subset legumes - include leguminous oil-seeds ) glycemic control 41 control feeding trial . It find pulse alone part low-glycemic index high-fibre diet improve marker glycemic control . The investigator also previously conduct systematic review meta-analysis effect dietary pulse blood pressure 8 isocaloric control feeding trial . It find diet high dietary pulse significantly lower systolic mean arterial blood pressure compare diet contain pulse . Significance : The propose project aid knowledge translation relate effect legumes blood pressure , update knowledge synthesis dietary pulse broaden assess effect type legume , strengthen evidence-base dietary recommendation health claim improve heart health outcome inform healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research .</detailed_description>
