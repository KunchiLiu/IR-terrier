It also predict change associate MBSR intervention still present 3-month follow-up assessment well . The final objective current proposal exploratory aim determine whether site patient 's stroke play role ability benefit MBSR . Previous research suggest leave prefrontal cortex play critical role underlie effect MBSR . Thus , patient without left prefrontal involvement compare , predict involvement brain region modulate observe effect . Such information could use target Veterans benefit propose intervention . If successful , investigator plan execute large efficacy study evaluate magnitude treatment effect associate MBSR . Alternative intervention MBSR provide low-cost , non-invasive rehabilitative treatment chronic stroke improve Veterans ' functional recovery general sense well-being .</detailed_description>
