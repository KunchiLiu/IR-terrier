	<brief_title>The Evaluation Mobile Device Measure Ataxia With High Altitude Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Hypoxia reduction partial pressure oxygen occur exposure altitude . Individuals acclimatize different rate different degree mean slow make necessary physiological adjustment develop sign symptom acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) . AMS mark headache , gastrointestinal disturbance , insomnia , fatigue ataxia , evaluate use subjective questionnaire Lake Louise Score ( LLS ) . Evaluation AMS solely use subjective questionnaire make differential diagnosis possible pathology difficult . Ataxia characterize poor coordination absence significant weakness . Ataxia assess performance coordinate task . The investigator develop novel finger-tapping task mobile device ass reaction time accuracy . The propose research evaluate utility tool assess human acclimatization hypoxia , could ultimately serve novel , objective methodology diagnosis AMS . Hypothesis : ( 1 ) When expose simulate altitude ( equivalent 4200m sea level ) , subject exhibit diminished coordination relative sham exposure . ( 2 ) Reaction time novel coordination task positively correlate heart rate , balance , LLS . ( 3 ) Accuracy novel coordination task negatively correlate heart rate , balance , LLS . Methods : A repeated-measures design familiarization trial , hypoxic trial , sham trial use . Sixteen healthy adult expose normobaric hypoxia investigator 's chamber , simulate elevation 4200m sea level . Subjects measure pulse oxygen saturation , heart rate , complete LLS , Balance Error Scoring System ( BESS ) , well two electronic finger tap coordination task prior , 5 minute , 4 , 12 hour altitude chamber exposure . Outcomes : This research enhance investigator understand relationship coordination , balance , acclimatization hypoxia . It allow u validate new objective tool measurement acclimatization exposure hypoxia .</detailed_description>
