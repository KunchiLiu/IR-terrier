	<brief_summary>Over 300,000 people United States spinal cord injury many use manual wheelchair mobility . Most manual wheelchair user develop shoulder injury pain greatly affect quality life level independence . Understanding shoulder disease start manual wheelchair user daily activity contribute disease provide necessary evidence effective primary prevention method inhibit development disability . Our central hypothesis development shoulder disease manual wheelchair user strongly associate cumulative exposure elevate shoulder posture combine high upper body loading .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Shoulder Pathology Manual Wheelchair Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of 1.7 million wheelchair user United States ( US ) , 90 percent , 1.5 million person use manual wheelchair ( MWCs ) . People traumatic non-traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) make approximately 20 % MWC user , 12,000 new traumatic SCIs occur every year . While MWCs immediately available enable independence , 63 % MWC users one multiple rotator cuff tear decade MWC use compare 15 % age-matched able-bodied adult . A crucial gap knowledge exist understand shoulder MWC user function almost permanent seat position agent mobility , weight bearing , hand grasping ; alter function translate longitudinal shoulder health decline . The objective application define longitudinal component early phase ( chronic symptom onset ) shoulder health decline specific new MWC user characterize exposure alter shoulder function associate MRI sign early onset shoulder pathology . The investigator propose : ( Aim 1 ) quantify shoulder joint motion load real world 3 year 50 new MWC user match able-bodied cohort ; ( Aim 2 ) define early , preclinical change shoulder MRI specific MWC user , 3 year , comparison match cohort ; ( Aim 3 ) identify specific exposure measure risk factor early change MRI MWC user . Three central novel aspect proposal pave way target primary prevention : ( 1 ) characterizing alter shoulder function new MWC user real world hardware instrumentation suitable multiple , day long collection , ( 2 ) define early , preclinical pattern disease user compare match able-bodied cohort , ( 3 ) investigating combine effect shoulder motion load relationship incidence shoulder pathology . Successful completion project define shoulder respond MWC use ( Aim 1 ) , identify MWC-specific pattern shoulder disease MRI ( Aim 2 ) , determine alter shoulder function contribute shoulder health decline ( Aim 3 ) . This work provide foundation understand relative impact shoulder elevation load shoulder health decline . Additionally , work provide first build block define complete natural history shoulder disease MWC user . The investigator expect overall impact powerful influence environmental assistive technology redesign , post-SCI rehabilitation practice , insurance reimbursement shoulder health-preserving equipment , understand shoulder pathology general population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Group1 ( Manual Wheelchair User Cohort ) : Participants traumatic nontraumatic spinal cord injury begin use MWC within 12 month enrollment 18 70 year age Use manual wheelchair primary mode mobility Functional upper extremity range motion Willingness participate study Ability return receive shoulder MRI 13 times/year , per year receive physical exam , strength assessment . Group 2 ( Matched Ablebodied Cohort ) : 1870 year age Able walk independently reliance orthotic , prosthetic , gait aid Functional upper extremity range motion Willingness participate study Ability receive shoulder MRI 13 times/year , per year receive physical exam , strength assessment . Group1 ( Manual Wheelchair User Cohort ) : â€¢ Previous diagnosis bilateral shoulder tendon tear prior spinal cord injury suspect tendon tear physical exam Group 2 ( Matched Ablebodied Cohort ) : Any documented musculoskeletal neurological disorder would expect impact shoulder health change ability walk independently Previous diagnosis shoulder tear prior enrollment suspect tendon tear physical exam</criteria>
