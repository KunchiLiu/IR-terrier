	<brief_title>A Series Systematic Reviews Meta-analyses Effect Vegetarian/Vegan Diets Cardiometabolic Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Vegetarian and/or vegan dietary pattern show prospective cohort cross-sectional study associate low diabetes risk all-cause mortality . Evidence systematic review meta-analyses control trial also suggest vegetarian diet may beneficial glycemic control , blood lipid , weight loss , blood pressure . On contrary , evidence previous meta-analyses prospective cohort study , well recent prospective cohort study show diet higher animal protein , specifically red meat , associate increase incidence T2D . The effect follow vegetarian/vegan dietary pattern cardiometabolic risk factor individual diabetes less clear . Furthermore , diabetes guideline recommend follow vegetarian and/or vegan dietary pattern management diabetes provide low-grade evidence rating . Need propose research : High quality systematic review meta-analyses randomize controlled trial represent high level evidence support dietary guideline public health policy development . As dietary guideline public health policy shift toward food dietary-pattern base recommendation , need systematic review meta-analyses compare role vegetarian/vegan diet prevention management diabetes . Objective : To improve evidence-based guidance diabetes guideline public health policy development , investigator conduct series systematic review meta-analyses effect vegetarian/vegan diet cardiometabolic risk factor individual diabetes include measure ( 1 ) glycemic control , ( 2 ) blood lipid , ( 3 ) adiposity ( 4 ) blood pressure . Design : Each systematic review meta-analysis conduct accord Cochrane Handbook Systematic Reviews Interventions report accord Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials ( Clinical Trials ; CENTRAL ) search use appropriate search term supplement manual search reference include study . Study selection : Dietary randomize control trial conduct human follow-up duration ≥ 3 week investigate effect vegetarian/vegan diet measure ( 1 ) glycemic control , ( 2 ) blood lipid , ( 3 ) adiposity , ( 4 ) blood pressure include . Studies conduct human , randomize , acute feeding design ( &lt; 3 week ) , lack suitable control ( non-isocaloric ) and/or report viable endpoint data include . Data extraction : Two investigator independently extract relevant data ass risk bias use Cochrane Risk Bias Tool . All disagreement resolve consensus . Standard computation imputation use derive miss variance data . Outcomes : The propose synthesis assess set outcomes related different area cardiometabolic risk : ( 1 ) glycemic control ( HbA1c , fast glucose , fast insulin ) , ( 2 ) blood lipid ( LDL-C , non-HDL-C , HDL-C , triglyceride ) , ( 3 ) adiposity ( body weight , BMI , waist circumference ) , ( 4 ) blood pressure ( systolic diastolic blood pressure ) . Data synthesis : Separate pool analysis conduct area cardiometabolic control use Generic Inverse Variance method . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Exceptions make use fixed-effects model &lt; 5 included trial irrespective heterogeneity small trial pool large precise trial absence statistically significant heterogeneity . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity test Cochran 's Q statistic quantify I2 statistic . To explore source heterogeneity , investigator conduct sensitivity analysis , study systematically remove . If &gt; =10 study , investigator also explore source heterogeneity priori subgroup analysis study design ( parallel crossover ) , follow-up duration ( &lt; 12 week ≥12 week ) , comparator diet , baseline measurement , risk bias diabetes duration . Significant unexplained heterogeneity investigate additional post hoc subgroup analysis ( e.g . age , sex , level feed control [ metabolic , supplement , dietary advice ] , washout crossover trial , energy balance background diet , composition background diet [ total % energy fat , carbohydrate , protein ] , change cholesterol intake , change glycemic index , etc. ) . Meta-regression analysis assess significance categorical continuous subgroup analysis . When &gt; =10 study available , publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot formal test use Egger Begg test . If publication bias suspect , investigator attempt adjust funnel plot asymmetry impute miss study data use Duval Tweedie trim fill method . Evidence assessment : The strength evidence outcome assess use Grading Recommendations Assessment , Development Evaluation ( GRADE ) . Knowledge translation plan : The result disseminate interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Target audience include public health scientific community interest nutrition , diabetes , obesity , cardiovascular disease . Feedback incorporate use improve public health message key area future research define . Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers network among opinion leader increase awareness participate directly committee member development future guideline . Significance : The propose project aid knowledge translation relate role vegetarian/vegan diet prevention management diabetes , strengthen evidence-base guideline improve health outcome educate healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research design .</detailed_description>
