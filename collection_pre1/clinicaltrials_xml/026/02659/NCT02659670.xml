	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To assess adherence topical brimonidine treatment rosacea . Secondary Objectives : To determine impact report adherence rosacea outcome , To identify factor affect adherence rosacea treatment ass QOL . Study Design An investigator-blinded , prospective , 6 month study subject persistent erythema associate active rosacea conduct 20 subject age 18 year old . All subject receive standard-of-care brimonidine topical gel 0.33 % instruction apply daily per package insert . Adherence assess use weekly internet survey document often medication use , well reminder rosacea trigger general use brimonidine . Before start treatment , subject remind brimonidine indicated persistent , transient , erythema . Subjects give copy product package insert copy American Academy Dermatology website ( www.aad.org ) information rosacea contain standardize information diagnosis trigger . Subjects persistent erythema due rosacea recruit Wake Forest Baptist Health Dermatology Clinic IRB approve advertising . At baseline screen visit , subject diagnosis rosacea confirm investigator . Subjects classify erythematotelangiectatic combination erythematotelangiectatic papulopustular . The Investigator evaluate whether subject believe constant erythema intermittent flush blushing . Subjects inform benefit risk treatment indicated package insert . If agree participate , subject give write consent approve Institutional Review Board see follow 3 month 6 month . Subjects randomize ( accord standard randomization table ) 1:1 weekly internet survey group standard care non-survey group . The internet survey ask often use medication week , well give treatment tip reminder rosacea trigger . They ask variety question weekly internet survey- amount erythema currently ( measure VAS scale ) , much burning stinging , often use medication apply , well additional side effect may medication . Subjects non-internet survey group get identical survey Month 3 Month 6 visit . The Investigator also interest learn adherence survey subject begin use medication need basis , affect side effect profile satisfaction medication . At visit , review internet survey use medication weight do . Disease severity measure ( CEA , PSA , lesion count ) obtain . Investigator subject VAS scale measure facial erythema obtain . Adverse event log every visit . Attention pay symptom rebound erythema detailed information concern location timing collect . The lesion count also measure papule telangiectasia may become readily visible improvement background erythema . Telangiectasia count individually facial quadrant note Lesion Count Appendix . Measuring individual visible telangiectasia important subject may confuse underlie erythema rosacea , thus affect subject assessment disease . QOL survey complete end study visit . Descriptive statistic generate mean ± standard deviation ( S.D . ) median ( interquartile range ) continuous measure depend distribution data frequency distribution categorical variable . Estimate adherence rate obtain mean adherence rate along correspond 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
