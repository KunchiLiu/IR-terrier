	<brief_title>Impact Graft Steatosis Post-operative Complications After Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Solid organ transplantation become standard care select patient end-stage organ dysfunction . With improved surgical technique , effective immunosuppressive therapy , good anti-infective medication , outcome solid organ transplantation improve last several year . The excellent survival rate report orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) increase demand liver transplant enhance disparity number available donor organ need organ . The lack available organ liver transplantation ( LT ) associate increased death rate among patient wait list LT trigger use so-called extend criterion donor ( ECD ) graft , previously call `` suboptimal graft '' . Among wide range ECD liver , hepatic steatosis one frequent disorder , mostly related increase prevalence non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) increasingly significant healthy individual high worldwide prevalence , association metabolic syndrome insulin resistance , diabetes , dyslipidemia obesity , association liver-related morbidity mortality . Clinical evaluation current imaging modality , serological laboratory test strongly suggestive presence hepatic steatosis , none capable distinguish steatohepatitis ( SH ) uncomplicated steatosis ; likewise , evaluation generally detect advanced liver disease ( e.g . portal hypertension ) , none truly assess degree liver necroinflammatory injury , less stage fibrosis architectural remodeling . Liver biopsy evaluation , therefore , remain 'gold standard ' unequivocally diagnose SH document severity hepatic injury fibrosis . Steatosis assess accord pattern amount fatty infiltration hepatic tissue section . Traditionally , fatty accumulation classify morphologically macrovesicular microvesicular . Macrovesicular steatosis characterize single , bulky fat vacuole hepatocyte displaces nucleus edge cell . The less conspicuous microvesicular steatosis , usually related toxin metabolic disorder , characterize accumulation tiny lipid vesicle cytoplasm hepatocytes without nuclear dislocation . Current quantification grade liver steatosis originate study perform early 1990s , steatosis classify mild , moderate , severe , less 30 % , 30-60 % , 60 % hepatocytes , respectively , display fatty infiltration . Although usually benign , fatty liver may associate serious injury , inflammation hepatocyte necro-apoptosis , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , 20-30 % subject . Those patient risk develop fibrosis , one fifth progress liver cirrhosis . It apparently slowly progressive chronic liver disease , alcohol viral-induced disease . Moreover , problem hepatocytes fatty , overcome liver , increase risk cardiovascular disease death duplicate risk type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , independently severity liver injury . Severe fatty liver susceptible warm cold ischemia reperfusion injury normal one . The type damage pathway cellular apoptosis , necrosis . The use steatotic graft orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) associate high rate primary graft dysfunction decrease graft patient survival particularly macro-steatosis .</detailed_description>
