	<brief_title>Effects Buprenorphine Mood Adults With Range Depressive Symptomatology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It show opioid analgesic , particularly mu-opioid partial agonist buprenorphine , anti-depressant property laboratory animal model . In human , rate prescription opioid abuse significantly high patient depression . This suggest individual negative mood state ( e.g. , depressive state ) may respond positively opioid drug . A handful small study human suggest buprenorphine reduces symptom depression patient respond standard anti-depressants , laboratory study show buprenorphine may reduce response type negative stimulus enhance response positive stimulus . However , control laboratory study assess potential anti-depressant effect opioid medication never conduct . In project , investigator propose examine depressive symptomatology predictor subjective mood response buprenorphine , use two measure ; ) self-reported depressive symptomatology measure Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI-II ) , ii ) physiological index depressive symptomatology measure heart rate variability . Reduced heart rate variability show associated depression , physiological measure may allow detection subtle effect would self-report questionnaire alone . Healthy volunteer ( N=60 ) first complete BDI provide baseline measure heart rate variability . Then attend two laboratory session , receive placebo , 0.2mg buprenorphine , 0.4mg buprenorphine counterbalance order . The investigator test low dos buprenorphine previous study , produce measurable change mood behavior healthy volunteer . The investigator collect measure mood physiological drug response ( pupillometry , heart rate , blood pressure ) regular interval throughout session , examine baseline index depressive symptomatology relation response drug . The central hypothesis individual great self-reported depressive symptom low heart rate variability experience great enhancement mood response buprenorphine . It expect work provide well understand individual likely experience positive mood effect response opioid drug , may therefore at-risk develop opioid use disorder . Furthermore , may lay foundation future research development novel opioid-based treatment depression . Design : The study use 3-session within-subjects double-blind design participant receive single dos buprenorphine ( 0 , 0.2 , 0.4 mg sublingual ) randomize order . All screening , orientation , study session procedure take place Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory suite L4 wing 5841 S. Maryland Ave. Drug Doses : Investigators administer placebo , 0.2 mg 0.4 mg buprenorphine ( Temgesic ) via sublingual tablet counterbalance order double-blind condition . These tablet dissolve within 5-8 minute . This drug approve treatment severe pain . The onset action sublingual administration 30 minute , peak plasma concentration 1/5-2 hour half-life 5 hour . These dos buprenorphine low , average maintenance dose opioid abuser 8 mg . The 0.2-mg dose help establish dose-response curve effect . Doses separate least 72 hour .</detailed_description>
