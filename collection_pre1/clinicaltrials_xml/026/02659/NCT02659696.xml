	<brief_title>Nalfurafine Hydrochloride Pruritus Patients With Primary Biliary Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary biliary cholangitis ( PBC , formally know primary biliary cirrhosis ) chronic cholestatic liver disease . Taking advantage ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) , outcome patient PBC improve , comparable general population . However , pruritus , often persist annoy symptom , may decrease quality life ( QOL ) patient PBC . Although anti-histamines administered efficacy limit , drug clearly prove effective suppressing pruritus develop worldwide . Nalfurafine hydrochloride selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist develop Japan , January 2009 approve pruritus patient renal failure hemodialysis . A phase 3 trial nalfurafine hydrochloride pruritus patient chronic liver disease complete , indicate efficacy well safety confirm . Therefore , May 2015 use nalfurafine hydrochloride officially approve Japan pruritus patient chronic liver disease include PBC . However , 59 patient PBC include therefore still unclear whether nalfurafine chloride effective PBC patient part , whether effect drug depend coadministered drug complication , whether drug may improve QOL overall patient PBC . In current study , investigator aim assess pruritus overall QOL administration nalfurafine hydrochloride patient PBC , answer clinical question describe . Furthermore , investigator take serum sample enrol patient examine association pruritus possible biomarkers .</detailed_description>
