	<brief_title>Triumeq As Integrase Single Tablet Regimen People With HIV Who Inject Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dolutegravir ( DTG ) integrase strand transfer inhibitor ( INSTI ) support once-daily dosing without need pharmacokinetic boosting may co-formulated antiretrovirals single-tablet regimen ( STR ) . With people live HIV injection drug use ( IDU ) prone unplanned antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) discontinuation suboptimal adherence , DTG offer high genetic barrier resistance , profile reduces drug-drug interaction , good tolerability availability single tablet regimen ( STR ) combine abacavir lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) likely improve adherence . The aim study include : - To assess tolerability self-reported adverse effect direct symptom questionnaire - To determine change number severity report ART-related adverse effect baseline week 48 96 - To determine change health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) baseline week 48 96 - To determine change frailty score baseline week 48 96 - To determine percentage subject unscheduled ART discontinuations/ interruption 96 week - To determine estimate number week miss ART 48 96 week follow-up - To determine change baseline medication possession ratio ( MPR ) 48 96 week adherence score measured antiretroviral therapy medication self-report form time point - To determine percentage subject HIV RNA &lt; 40 copies/mL 96 week - To determine change genotypic resistance profile subject experience virological failure - To determine change CD4+ T-cell count 96 week - To determine change bone mineral density 96 week - To determine number subject adverse serious adverse event ( SAE ) baseline week 96 - To determine number subject Grade 1 4 laboratory abnormality baseline week 96 This prospective , single arm , open-label 96 week clinical trial . Study subject follow 96 week post enrolment , regular clinical evaluation , laboratory evaluation , safety adherence assessment , quality life bone mineral density ( BMD ) measure regular interval .</detailed_description>
