	<brief_summary>Bystander intervention , recognize promising violence prevention strategy , unique engagement community member 1 ) recognize situation may become violent 2 ) learn safely effectively intervene reduce violence risk . Based promise , Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act ( SaVE ) require publicly-funded college provide bystander intervention . With SaVE 's policy intervention require bystander intervention , `` natural experiment '' arise determine relative efficacy student ' bystander training across multiple college . Investigators propose quasi-experimental design ( use fractional factorial ) evaluate relative efficacy three bystander intervention reduce violence college community . Green Dot one three bystander intervention evaluate . A recent rigorous evaluation find Green Dot associate 20-40 % reduction VAW college high school setting . In aim 1 , investigator compare relative efficacy bystander intervention ) increase bystander efficacy behavior , b ) reduce violence acceptance , c ) reduce interpersonal violence victimization perpetration , ) increase program cost effectiveness . The three main bystander group compare : exclusively online training , Green Dot ( speech intensive bystander training ) , skills-based bystander training . Program efficacy data obtain student survey , campus crime statistic , survey college staff administrator responsible select implement bystander intervention . In aim 2 , investigator seek grow community VAW prevention researcher . Researcher community form researcher ' engagement college recruitment , survey design , data collection analysis . Specifically investigator determine efficacy program increase VAW prevention research productivity define ) increase research skill b ) increase research communication measure manuscript submission , presentation , publication . This natural experiment generate new understanding efficacy bystander program work . This natural experiment also provide VAW research community opportunity increase skill-sets share experience help grow next generation VAW prevention researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . SPECIFIC AIMS Goal 1 . Grow Colleges Communities Primary Prevention Violence Against Women Research The opportunity : Because 2013 Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act1 ( SaVE ) require bystander train publicly fund college university ( hereafter college ) , `` natural experiment '' present determine component bystander intervention great efficacy . Inclusion multiple college community ( n=24 ) provide sufficient statistical power comparison . The timing U01 ( RFA-CE-15-003 ) strategically important work investigator propose : evaluate efficacy bystander intervention component ( BIC ) reduce violence woman ( VAW : operationally define intimate partner violence ( IPV ) sexual violence ( SV ) ) . Investigators propose quasi-experimental design use fractional factorial . Data measure program efficacy bystander violent behavior outcome obtain student survey campus crime data . Key informant interview college administrator responsible selection implementation bystander program describe component attribute bystander program important college ' adoption , implementation retention bystander program 4 year . The purpose quasi-experimental , multi-college study evaluate relative efficacy newly implement bystander intervention time . Because college must adopt intervention , comparison make prospectively implementation across program intervention . Aim 1 . Compare relative efficacy bystander intervention ) increase bystander efficacy behavior , b ) reduce violence acceptance , c ) reduce violence victimization perpetration , ) increase program cost effectiveness . Three BIC comparison : exclusively online training , Green Dot , skills-based , interactive bystander program . Whether train mandatory also evaluate . Hypothesis 1 : Relative college implement exclusively online training , college implement Green Dot ( skills-based program ) significantly ) increase bystander efficacy behavior , b ) reduce violence acceptance , c ) reduce violence victimization perpetration , ) demonstrate great cost effectiveness reduce VAW . Goal 2 . Grow Communities Violence Against Women Prevention Researchers The opportunity : This `` natural experiment '' also offer unique opportunity senior VAW prevention researcher share expertise junior researcher , i.e . grow researcher community . Team science increasingly required violence prevention research yet fund mechanism support cross-institutional cross-disciplinary career development grant violence prevention limit . The purpose : Investigators propose researcher community collaborative grow next generation VAW researcher . Through engage multiple public university research community partner ( Goal 1 ) , investigator add opportunity partner researcher community ) conduct well research broad skill-set engage b ) share research skill-sets junior researcher . Aim 2 . Determine efficacy collaborative increase VAW prevention researcher ' productivity define ) research skills b ) research communication measure manuscript submission , presentation , publication . Both senior junior researcher member collaborative included prospective qualitative quantitative assessment . Hypothesis 2 : Participation within research community , time , increase research productivity senior junior collaborative member relative productivity prior study participation . Expected outcome : ( Aim 1 ) This study identify component bystander program associate great violence prevention efficacy great cost-effectiveness . Currently colleges limit data experience make inform decision regard select bystander intervention , require SaVE . With range bystander program comparison afford include 24 multiple college community , investigator ability measure relative bystander program efficacy ( program associate great reduction violence ) , program associate low program implementation cost , program associate low cost violence reduction ratio . ( Aim 2 ) As senior junior researcher engage college recruitment , mixed-method data collection , data analysis , research skill-sets share senior researcher learn new research approach junior researcher learn skill survey design conduct , measurement survey sensitive topic ) , data analysis , research communication . Benchmarks Success measure : [ Aim 1 ] ability recruit 24 college , conduct key informant interview annual undergraduate survey , final analysis Fall 2019 ; [ Aim 2 ] ability , collaborative , recruit retain VAW prevention researcher identify college provide mentor training need advance research skill .</detailed_description>
