	<brief_summary>Anti-HIV drug cut number serious infection people HIV get . However , subject take anti-HIV drug achieve adequate cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) recovery decrease elevate cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) cell . Such patient low CD4/CD8 ratio remain risk develop acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) non-AIDS-related complication . Two important factor associate low CD4/CD8 ratio include : persistence HIV ART inflammation . Metformin , widely use medication treat type 2 diabetes , well tolerate minimal side effect . It link anti-aging weight reduce property non-diabetic person . Because ability improve immune function , metformin could promise addition ART HIV patient . It also report change composition microbe gut may improve inflammation . PURPOSES OF THE STUDY The purpose study find : 1. metformin combine anti-HIV drug reduce amount hidden virus body ; 2. metformin combine anti-HIV drug improve immune function . 3. metformin combine anti-HIV drug impact CD4 T cell count CD4/CD8 T cell ratio treatment discontinuation 4. metformin change composition bacteria gut may improve inflammation . For purpose , investigator add metformin usual antidiabetic dose 12 week patient receive stable ART , CD4/CD8 ratio 0.7 . Approximately 22 participant enrol study Chronic Viral Illness Service McGill University Health Centre , Ottawa Hospital Maple Leaf Medical Clinic ( Toronto ) . This study last 24 week ; metformin treatment 12 week . In order eligible study , participant must 18 year age old , undetectable viral load ( quantity HIV virus blood must less 50 copies/ml ) least 3 month CD4/CD8 ratio less 0.7 . All participant also ask give blood stool sample optional colon mucosal biopsy sample ( metformin supplementation ) study size viral reservoir amount T cell activation change gut microbiota composition .</brief_summary>
