	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : A study cycle 28 day . If find eligible take part study , begin take AZD1775 day laparoscopy . You first take AZD1775 tablet 2 time day Days 1-3 . Depending tumor reduction surgery schedule , may continue take study drug Days 8-10 , 15-17 , 22-24 . The study doctor discus . Before every time take AZD1775 tablet , take ondansetron ( Zofran ) . Before first dose AZD1775 week , take dexamethasone . You may also receive dexamethasone additional dos AZD1775 . Ondansetron dexamethasone standard drug give help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Your daily dos AZD1775 take 12 hour apart , 2 hour eat . If vomit take dose AZD1775 , retake dose . Wait next schedule dose . Your first dose AZD1775 Day 1 take least 1 hour laparoscopy . The second dose day may skip first dose take 12 PM . You need record take dose study drug diary . The study staff give study drug diary show fill . You stop take AZD1775 tablet 1-4 day tumor reduction surgery . After recover surgery ( 3-6 week later ) , receive standard chemotherapy treatment . The chemotherapy part standard care treatment part research study . The type chemotherapy receive doctor . Study Visits : On day laparoscopy : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Tumor tissue collect laparoscopy procedure biomarker genetic testing . All sample store MD Anderson Gynecologic Oncology Tumor Bank unlimited amount time test relate study . Your sample give code number . No identify information directly link sample . Only researcher charge bank access code number able link sample . This allow medical data relate sample update need . While take AZD1775 , weekly visit . At visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test . If tumor reduction surgery , stop study visit last dose AZD1775 continue follow-up part study ( describe ) . If go tumor reduction surgery , study visit . You ask sign separate consent document tumor reduction surgery explain procedure risk . On day pre-operative visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine , genetic , biomarker test . - You EKG . On day surgery : - Tumor tissue collect genetic biomarker test already schedule tumor reduction surgery . All sample store MD Anderson Gynecologic Oncology Tumor Bank unlimited amount time test relate study . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On day post-operative visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine biomarker test . - If doctor think need , EKG . Length Treatment : You may take study drug 24 day ( include rest day dose ) . You longer able take study drug intolerable side effect occur , eligible treatment surgery , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up . Follow-Up : Within 30 day surgery : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine , genetic , biomarker test . - If doctor think need , EKG . Standard Follow-Up : You continue follow-up visit every 3 month part standard care . This investigational study . AZD1775 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
