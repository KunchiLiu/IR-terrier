	<brief_summary>Background : Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) disease damage central nervous system ( brain spinal cord ) . This lead increased physical disability time . The disease lifelong begin . Researchers want learn MS stage follow person death . Objective : To understand physical clinical sign MS relate change time . Eligibility : Adults age 18 old MS disease brain spinal cord may act like MS. Design : Participants medical history complete neurological exam . They may time test neurological function , 25-foot walk 9-hole peg test . Participants multi-day visit year . Participants blood drawn . Participants may brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . They may also MRI spinal cord . They may get contrast agent ( dye ) inject tube arm vein . During MRI , participant lie table slide metal cylinder . Participants thickness retina measure use optical coherence tomography . A camera top table use laser . Participants look lens follow instruction . Eye drop may use dilate pupil . Participants chew piece sterile cotton 1 minute collect saliva . Participants agree autopsy time death donate organ research , brain spinal cord .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The goal protocol understand pathology multiple sclerosis ( MS ) relate evolution time observed neuroradiological , clinical , biological data collection vivo . Study population : This study enroll 100 individual MS , target 50 study completers , across various age stage disease , well 20 appropriate disease control participant , total 120 participant . Design : This longitudinal cohort study participant see approximately annually NIH Clinical Center . Most visit extend several day . Participants receive ongoing care outside clinician . They may also concurrently participate additional research protocols NIH elsewhere , data may share protocol current one . At time death , central nervous system ( CNS ) ( brain , spinal cord , retina , cerebrospinal fluid ) , well lymph node possibly lymphoid tissue , harvest . Outcome measure : Outcome measure include data derive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain spinal cord , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) retina , clinical examination , disability scale ; radiological pathological examination CNS tissue ; correlation vivo postmortem measure . Particular attention pay extent longitudinal vivo change predict postmortem finding .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis MS accord consensus criterion time enrollment OR diagnosis disease share clinical , image , biological feature MS. Age great equal 18 . Able participate study procedure provide highquality clinical research data ( example , prior MRI scan show ability tolerate MRI scan minimal motion artifact ) . Agrees return NIH followup visit approximately annually time autopsy . Note : participant become sick return NIH remove study . Agrees undergo autopsy donation least brain , spinal cord , retina . Able provide inform consent time initial study enrollment willing appoint Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) advance directive already place . Simultaneously participate another screen natural history protocol within NINDS Neuroimmunology Clinic time study entry . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Unwilling allow share and/or use future study cod sample data collect study .</criteria>
