	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter pilot Phase 1 study checkpoint antibody ipilimumab nivolumab combination radiotherapy 18 subject unresectable stage IV melanoma . All subject receive concurrent ipilimumab ( 3 mg/kg ) nivolumab ( 1 mg/kg ) every 3 week 4 dos , follow nivolumab monotherapy ( 3 mg/kg ) every 2 week . Radiotherapy initiate first dose second dose immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
