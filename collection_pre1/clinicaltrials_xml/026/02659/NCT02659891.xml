	<brief_summary>The overall goal study rapidly improve clearance BK viremia Immunoglobulin ( Privigen® ) thereby decrease potential formation alloantibody renal transplant recipient immunosuppression reduction due BK viremia . Our approach perform prospective , randomize , placebo control trial intravenous immune globulin ( IVIg ; Privigen® ) plus protocolized immunosuppression reduction versus placebo protocolized immunosuppression reduction patient BK viremia post-kidney transplantation .</brief_summary>

Kidney transplant recipient ( live decease donor ) receive transplant last year new onset BK viremia ( define BKV plasma DNA load &gt; 1000 copies/mL realtime PCR within 2 week enrollment ) . For value &gt; 5000 copies/mL repeat test require . For value ≤5000 copies/mL repeat test perform confirm viremia enrollment . Immunosuppression therapy enrollment tacrolimus , MPA , +/ prednisone . Men Women 18 75 year age . Absence DQ mismatch donor . Patient known HLA antibody direct donor antigen ( preform DSA ) prior transplant . Known positive donor specific antiHLA antibody ( IgG ) follow transplant time BK viremia detection ( DSA MFI &gt; 1000 consider positive ) . DSA detect via center 's standard care test . If center routinely screen patient may still enrol . History biopsy proven acute rejection ( cellular antibody ) time prior enrollment . BKV plasma DNA viral load &gt; 300,000 copies/ml .
