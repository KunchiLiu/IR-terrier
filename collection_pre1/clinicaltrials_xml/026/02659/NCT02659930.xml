	<brief_summary>Background : Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) cancer often see people HIV . It cause lesion . These usually skin sometimes lymph node , lung , gastrointestinal tract . Researchers think combination drug may help treat KS . Objective : To test combination anti-cancer drug pomalidomide ( CC-4047 ) liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil ) people KS . Eligibility : People age 18 KS Design : Participants screen : Medical history Questionnaires Physical exam Blood , urine , heart test Chest X-ray Biopsy : A small sample tissue take KS lesion . Possible CT scan Possible exam lung gastrointestinal tract endoscope : A flexible instrument examines inside organ . Participants take drug 4-week cycle . They take Doxil IV Day 1 cycle . They take CC-4047 tablet mouth day first 3 week cycle . Participants many visit : Before start treatment To start cycle Day 15 first 2 cycle Visits include repeat screen test : Multiple blood draw Photographs lesions Participants keep drug diary . Participants take aspirin drug prevent blood clot . Participants HIV combination antiretroviral therapy . Some participant PET scan . Participants continue treatment long tolerate KS improve . After treatment , several follow-up visit 5 year</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomalidomide Combination With Liposomal Doxorubicin People With Advanced Refractory Kaposi Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Kaposi Sarcoma ( KS ) multicentric angioproliferative tumor frequently involve skin , also involve lymph node , lung gastrointestinal tract . It common people HIV form immune compromise . Patients AIDS-associated KS bad survival HIV-infected patient without KS . - Patients may present advanced disease KS and/or concurrent KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease ( MCD ) IL-6 related KSHV-associated cytokine syndrome ( KICS ) . Patients latter condition poor outcomes treat FDA-approved cytotoxic therapy use KS , novel approach need . - A Phase I/II Study demonstrate pomalidomide 5 mg daily day 1- 21 28 Day Cycle safe tolerable patient KS without HIV . Increased CD4+ CD8+ T-cell count KS regression observe . - Combination pomalidomide liposomal doxorubicin may offer new approach patient advance KS KS concurrent KSHV-associated MCD KICS Objectives : - Evaluate safety tolerability various dose combination pomalidomide liposomal doxorubicin two group patient : Group I ) KS require systemic therapy ; Group II ) KS concurrent KSHV-associated MCD KICS - To assess pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pomalidomide combination liposomal doxorubicin ; patient HIV combination antiretroviral therapy Eligibility : - Patients biopsy proven ( confirmed Laboratory Pathology , CCR ) Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) - Group I : KS require systemic therapy ( prior therapy require ) - T1 KS , KS skin sufficiently widespread amenable local therapy , KS affect quality life due local symptom psychological distress OR -- KS patient inadequate response pomalidomide ( either progressive disease stable disease 4 month ) OR - KS patient inadequate response liposomal doxorubicin , paclitaxel , systemic chemotherapy ( either progressive disease stable disease 6 cycle ) - Group I exclude patient eligible Group II ( ) . - A wash period treatment 3 week require , except case patient progressive , severe disease delay treatment justified ( i.e . symptomatic pulmonary KS ) -Group II : KS one follow high-risk group ( prior therapy require ) : - Concurrent KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease ( MCD ) - KSHV Inflammatory Cytokine Syndrome ( KICS ) , include also meet clinical criteriafor KS immune reconstitution syndrome ( KS IRIS ) Patients primary effusion lymphoma large cell lymphoma arise KSHV-associated MCD exclude . - At least five measurable cutaneous KS lesion previous local radiation , surgical intralesional cytotoxic therapy would prevent response assessment lesion ; evaluable disease . - ECOG Performance Status ( PS ) : Group I : less equal 2 , Group II : less equal 3 , ECOG PS 4 ( Karnofsky 20 % ) allow Group II symptom due pulmonary KS . - Measurable disease criterion propose AIDS Clinical Trials Group Oncology Committee ( KS ) . - Patient legal guardian must willing give informed consent . - Patients HIV positive negative . - HAART HIV+ patient . Design : - This Phase I study evaluate 2 group patient KS . Patients receive pomalidomide day , day 1-21 28-day cycle , various dose level combine liposomal doxorubicin IV day 1 28-day cycle optimal tumor response , unacceptable toxicity , patient request discontinue - Patients HIV prescribed HAART . - All patient receive thromboprophylaxis , generally aspirin 81 mg tablet daily . - This study also evaluate characteristic 18fluoro-thymidine ( FLT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) patient KS concurrent KSHV-associated MCD KICS , correlate marker KSHV-lytic activation</detailed_description>
