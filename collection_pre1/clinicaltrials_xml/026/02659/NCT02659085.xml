	<brief_summary>Developing effective faster act antidepressant outmost clinical importance . Available antidepressant therapy delay therapeutic effect . It typically take several week symptom relief evident . Furthermore , antidepressants relatively ineffective - many 30 % patient respond medication . In study investigator evaluate NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine potentially new antidepressant treatment severely depressed patient compare effectiveness electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In line PICO model , patient selection procedure experimental control treatments outcome measure rigorously define . Inpatients , age 18-85 , diagnose major depressive disorder ( MDD , accord DSM-IV ) , offer accept ECT , eligible participate . Patients must proficient spoken write Swedish , score ≥ 20 point Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Exclusion criterion know allergy active substance ; co-morbid condition could interfere treatment ( e.g . primary psychosis ) ; habitual difficulty speak , hear , remember reason ; on-going recent ( 6 month ) drug abuse ; treatment accord LPT ( Lagen om psykiatrisk tvångsvård ; Compulsory Psychiatric Care Act ) ; number cardiovascular condition . Patients randomized experimental treatment receive intravenous infusion racemic ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg ) , delivered period forty minute thrice weekly ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) . Patients control group receive ECT line standard procedure ( include anesthesia , muscle relaxation oxygenation ) thrice weekly . ECT choose reference treatment effective treatment patient suffer moderate severe depression . Primary outcome proportion patient remission 4 week treatment arm . Remission define MADRS ≤ 10 . The study use non-inferiority design . Demonstrating superiority ketamine option base number patient need gain sufficient power design . Also , investigator believe ketamine treatment need effective , least term primary outcome . ECT associate side effect ( particular amnesia treatment period , patient also report persistent memory problem ) patient need anaesthetise supervision anaesthesiologist . The treatment thus fairly demand expensive . A significant amount patient also unwilling undergo ECT . Given non- inferiority ketamine regard primary outcome , give associate few side effect short time remission involve need anaesthesia , risk-benefit analysis scale might tip favour ketamine , even superior per se . Secondary outcome include proportion patient mission /or response symptomatic relief follow-up time point ( 3 , 6 12 month treatment cessation ) . Also address two treatment affect cognition . A computerized test battery , Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB ) administer prior first treatment , two week , shortly remission three additional time point ( 3 , 6 12 month ) conclusion treatment . See figure specification description cognitive test . Blood sample draw first treatment 2-3 month finish treatment . Apart plasma serum sample ( use later analysis potential biomarkers IL 6 D-serine ) , additional blood collect genomic DNA analysis . A total 4 x 6 mL take occasion . Blood sample store regional biobank . Time response analyse parametric survival analysis ( change MADRS score ) non-parametric analysis two-way ordinal data repeat measurements34 ( ordinal data ) . Cognitive data biological sample analyse t-tests ( pair unpaired appropriate ) analysis variance ANOVA . Study sample size calculate base actual assumed remission rate , primary outcome parameter study . A remission rate 60 % set reference treatment ( ECT ) . A non-inferiority limit 40 % set experimental intervention ( ketamine ) . This arbitrary level , base assumption few mild side effect , faster antidepressant effect fact patient need anaesthetize give muscle relaxant . With limit , power 80 % significance level 5 % , 97 patient required arm , accord : n = ( 2 * 8,4 * p ( 1-p ) / difference2 ) , `` 2 '' `` 8,4 '' derive significance power level , p ( actual assume ) level proportion patient reach remission ECT ketamine ( 60 % 40 % respectively ) . The size cohort calculate sufficiently large detect ECT-associated cognitive side effect .</detailed_description>
