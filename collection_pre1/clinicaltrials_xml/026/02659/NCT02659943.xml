	<brief_title>T Cells Expressing Fully-human AntiCD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor Treating B-cell Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Improved treatment variety treatment-resistant B-cell malignancy include Bcell lymphomas chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , need . - A particular need development new treatment chemotherapy-refractory B-cell malignancy . - T cell genetically modify express chimeric antigen receptor ( CARs ) specifically target malignancy-associated antigen . - Autologous T cell genetically modify express CARs target B-cell antigen CD19 cause complete remission small number patient leukemia lymphoma . These result demonstrate anti-CD19 CAR-expressing T cell antimalignancy activity human . - The vast majority B-cell malignancy express CD19 . - CD19 express normal cell except B cell . - We construct novel fully-human anti-CD19 CAR specifically recognize CD19-expressing target cell vitro eradicate CD19-expressing tumor mouse . - This fully-human CAR target CD19 test human . - Possible toxicity include cytokine-associated toxicity fever , hypotension , neurological toxicity . Elimination normal B cell probable , unknown toxicity also possible . Objectives : Primary -Determine safety feasibility administer T cell express novel fully-human anti-CD19 CAR patient advance B-cell malignancy . Secondary - Evaluate vivo persistence peak blood level anti-CD19 CAR T cell initial repeated CAR T-cell infusion . CAR T-cell blood level compare retrospectively result anti-CD19 CAR contain antigen-recognition moiety derive murine antibody . - Assess evidence anti-malignancy activity anti-CD19 CAR T cell - Assess impact repeat CAR T-cell infusion residual malignancy initial CAR T-cell infusion . - Assess immunogenicity CAR use protocol . Eligibility : - Patients must B-cell lymphoma , CLL/SLL . Lower grade lymphoma transform DLBCL potentially eligible primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma subtypes DLBCL . - Patients must malignancy measurable CT scan flow cytometry bone marrow blood . - Patients must creatinine 1.4 mg/dL less normal cardiac ejection fraction . - An ECOG performance status 0-1 require . - No active infection allow include history hepatitis B hepatitis C. - Absolute neutrophil count great equal to1000/microliter , platelet count great equal 45,000/microliter , hemoglobin great equal 8g/dL - Serum ALT AST less equal 3 time upper limit institutional normal unless liver involvement malignancy demonstrate . - At least 14 day must elapse time prior systemic treatment ( include corticosteroid ) initiation protocol enrollment . - The patient malignancy need assess CD19 expression flow cytometry immunohistochemistry perform NIH . If unstained , paraffinembedded bone marrow lymphoma section available prior biopsy , use determine CD19 expression immunohistochemistry ; otherwise , patient need come NIH biopsy determine CD19 expression . The sample CD19 expression come biopsy obtain time enrollment . - Patients never allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant potentially eligible . Design : - This phase I dose-escalation trial - Patients undergo leukapheresis - T-cells obtain leukapheresis genetically modify express anti-CD19 CAR - Patients receive lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy condition regimen intent enhance activity infuse anti-CD19-CAR-expressing T cell . - The chemotherapy condition regimen cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m ( 2 ) daily 3 day fludarabine 30 mg/m ( 2 ) daily 3 day . Fludarabine give day cyclophosphamide . - Two day chemotherapy end , patient receive infusion anti-CD19-CAR-expressing T cell . - The initial dose level dose-escalation trial 0.66x10 ( 6 ) CAR+ T cells/kg recipient bodyweight . - The cell dose administer escalated maximum tolerate dose determine . - Following T-cell infusion , mandatory 9-day inpatient hospitalization monitor toxicity . - Outpatient follow-up plan 2 week , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month CAR T-cell infusion . Long-term gene-therapy follow-up consist yearly visit doctor near patient home 4 year yearly telephone contact 10 additional year require . - Repeat treatment consist condition chemotherapy follow CAR T-cell infusion plan eligible patient best response except continue complete remission progressive malignancy . - Re-enrollment allow small number subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Malignancy criterion : Patients follow malignancy potentially eligible : Bcell lymphoma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Patients indolent malignancy transform diffuse large Bcell lymphoma eligible . Clear CD19 expression must uniformly detect 75 % malignant cell either bone marrow leukemia lymphoma mass flow cytometry immunohistochemistry . These assay must perform National Institutes Health . It preferable require specimen use CD19 determination come sample obtained patient recent treatment . If paraffin embed unstained sample bone marrow involve malignancy lymphoma mass available , ship NIH CD19 staining ; otherwise , new biopsy need perform determination CD19 expression . DLBCL patient must receive least two prior chemotherapycontaining regimen least one must contain doxorubicin monoclonal antibody . Follicular lymphoma patient must receive least 2 prior regimen include least 1 regimen chemotherapy . All lymphoma leukemia patient must least 1 prior chemotherapycontaining regimen . All patient CLL small lymphocytic lymphoma must prior treatment ibrutinib another signal transduction inhibitor . Patients must measurable malignancy define least one criterion . Lymphoma leukemia mass measurable ( minimum 1.5 cm large diameter ) CT scan require diagnosis except CLL . For lymphoma mass count measurable malignancy , must abnormally increased metabolic activity assess positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan .
