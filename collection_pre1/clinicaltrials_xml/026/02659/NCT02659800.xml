	<brief_summary>This pilot , partially randomize clinical trial study well glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 work increase low cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4 count concurrent radiation temozolomide treatment patient gliomas tend grow rapidly spread ( high-grade ) . Treatment radiation chemotherapy , temozolomide , may cause abnormal decrease CD4 cell , important part immune system . Glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 may increase CD4 cell count improve survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IL-7 Increasing Low CD4 Counts After Concurrent Radiation Temozolomide Treatment Patients With High Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test effect CYT107 ( glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 ) CD4 count compare control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine optimal dose CYT107 . II . To evaluate effect concurrent dexamethasone . III . To evaluate duration effect CD4 count ( 6 month ) . IV . To evaluate total lymphocyte count time serial lymphocyte subtypes ( 6 month ) . V. To evaluate serial cytokine level ( 6 month ) . VI . To evaluate impact adjuvant temozolomide CYT107 effect CD4 count . VII . To evaluate anti-drug antibody . VIII . To evaluate safety toxicity CYT107 patient high grade glioma . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore overall survival patient . II . Tumor infiltrative lymphocyte could study patient undergo resection recurrent progressive tumor . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 group depend use dexamethasone . GROUP A ( NON-DEXAMETHASONE ) : Patients dexamethasone dose low physiologic dose ( = &lt; 0.75 mg daily ) randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM A1 : Patients receive placebo intramuscularly ( IM ) weekly 4 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM A2 : Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 10 ug/kg IM weekly 4 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM A3 : Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 20 ug/kg IM weekly 4 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP B ( DEXAMETHASONE ) : Patients require dexamethasone physiologic dose ( &gt; 0.75 mg daily ) randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM B1 : Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 Arm A2 . ARM B2 : Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 Arm A3 . In arm , patient receive adjuvant temozolomide day 1-5 per standard treatment begin 2 week post-glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 treatment . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I .
