	<detailed_description>In last year magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) well positron emission tomography ( PET ) prostate emerge promising imaging tool . MRI provide mainly morphologic information , increase degree , functional information tumor microenvironment use multiparametric approach lead increase diagnostic accuracy . Transition periurethral zone cancer identification patient ' individual risk ( e.g . development metastatic disease primary treatment ) still limitation method . PET , concern radiolabelled choline , provide functional predict data tumor metabolism aggressiveness find complimentary value morphologic image still caveat false positive false negative finding . To overcome limitation morphological functional imaging technique , hybrid image system develop introduced clinical routine . Additionally , recently develop 68Ga-labeled Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen ( PSMA ) provide highly specific information possible metastatic spread prostate cancer . Thus combine use PET-MRI wide spread application prostate cancer diagnosis , stag treatment planning . The potential novel technique general impact assess patient ' individual risk support therapy active surveillance decision future modify urological patient management yet explore detail , initial prospective clinical trial 38 patient sequential PET/MRI technique demonstrate ability significant improvement individual method . This registered prospective , randomized clinical trial intend proof , first step , superiority PET/MRI vs. actual clinical standard procedure apply stable multiparametric metabolic hybrid image protocol . The aim study reduce number unnecessary invasive procedure minimum ( image guide biopsy ) enable superior image guide risk stratification . In prospective , randomize , multi-arm , multi-treatment clinical trial 220 subject include 1 site within 3 year . With maximum follow-up early biochemical relapse 2 year plan duration exceed 5 year . The primary objective answer 36 month .</detailed_description>
