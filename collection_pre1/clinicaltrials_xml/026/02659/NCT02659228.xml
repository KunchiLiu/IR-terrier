	<brief_summary>In study , investigator explore anesthesia tool provide insight level consciousness individual clinical diagnosis unresponsive wakefulness syndrome ( UWS ) , possess neurophysiological signature conscious awareness . This group , could potentially conscious , herein refer target population . Our goal ass whether neurological pattern consciousness target population respond anesthesia similar manner neurologically compromised individual know consciousness ( e.g . minimally conscious state ( MCS ) . In healthy control , propofol-induced unconsciousness result elimination mismatch negativity event-related brain potential ( ERP ) diminish direct connectivity . The investigator hypothesize dos well require surgery , anesthesia similar effect neural pattern neurologically compromise patient potential conscious awareness , affect pattern lack consciousness .</brief_summary>
