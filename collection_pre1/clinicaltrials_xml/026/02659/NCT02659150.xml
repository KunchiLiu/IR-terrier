	<detailed_description>This multi-center study recruit 21 subject undergo open-label tocilizumab treatment 13-18 week order examine efficacy tocilizumab plaque inflammation RA patient . This multi-center study employ PET/MR image carotid coronary artery aorta assess effect anti-IL-6 therapy arterial inflammation patient RA synthetic dMARD inadequate responder naive biologic therapy . Secondary , exploratory evaluation also examine correlation atherosclerotic plaque inflammation inflammatory activity rheumatoid joint measure PET-MR imaging , well change inflammation correlate lipid inflammatory biomarkers , stress level associate inflammatory activity . Adults 50 75 year old diagnose RA come initial screen visit assess clinical eligibility criterion ( visit 1 ) . During screen period , patient acceptability study assess basis medical history , concomitant medication , physical examination , clinical laboratory test result . The study doctor review screen test result procedure determine subject eligibility prior image . Women able become pregnant exclude due teratogenic side effect . A FDG-PET/MR imaging study perform second screening visit ( visit 2 ) ass presence arterial , plaque joint inflammation . A serum pregnancy test drawn confirm negative prior image female subject childbearing potential . Acceptability study participant confirm basis tissue-to-background ratio ( TBR ) great equal 1.7 qualify vessel ( calculate use mean maximum SUV ) measure FDG-PET/MR imaging . Participants meet clinical image eligibility criterion enrol study ( visit 3 ) . Subjects receive first dose tocilizumab subcutaneously , subsequent week , subject instruct self-administer tocilizumab dose 162mg every week 12 week period . 4 week post-initiation , participant return clinical safety follow-up ( visit 4 ) . Final evaluation include physical exam , clinical assessment carotid IMT test . A second FDG-PET/MR imaging session take place 12 week post-administration ( visit 5 ) . Effect tocilizumab arterial plaque inflammation examine measure change FDG uptake carotid artery , coronary artery aorta baseline 12 week FDG-PET/MRI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults age 5075 Diagnosis RA accord revised 1987 American College Rheumatology ( ACR ; formerly American Rheumatism Association ) , criterion . Patients inadequate response nonbiologic diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) naïve biologic agent . Presence plaque inflammation , identify secondary screening , define target baseline ( TBR ratio ) ≥ 1.7 carotid artery ascend aorta . Not wheelchair bedbound . At screening , active RA consist ≥4 swollen joint ( 28 joint count ) ≥ 4 tender joint ( 28 joint count ) one follow criterion : Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) ( Westergren ) ≥ upper limit normal CRP ≥ upper limit normal If use nonbiologic DMARDS , ( ex : methotrexate , sulfasalazine , hydroxychloroquine , azathioprine , cyclosporine , leflunomide ) , patient must demonstrate inadequate response , stable dose ( ) least 4 week prior baseline visit . For methotrexate : patient must methotrexate least 3 month 4 week stable dose , stay stable dose study . take corticosteroid , must stable dos oral corticosteroid ( ≤ 10mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 4 week prior baseline visit . Dose remain stable throughout study . Any investigational treatment mention elsewhere must discontinue 4 week 5 half life , whichever longer , prior baseline visit . Exposure investigational biologics discuss Sponsor . Signed informed consent ( informed assent minor , applicable ) . Men woman reproductive potential must agree use acceptable method birth control treatment twelve month completion treatment . Subject provide write informed consent Major surgery ( include joint surgery ) within 8 week prior screen plan major surgery within 6 month follow randomization . Treatment investigational agent within 4 week ( 5 halflives investigational drug , whichever long ) screening . Previous treatment celldepleting therapy , include investigational agent approve therapy , example include : CAMPATH , antiCD4 , antiCD5 , antiCD3 , antiCD19 antiCD20 . Treatment intravenous gamma globulin , plasmapheresis Prosorba column within 6 month baseline . Immunization live/attenuated vaccine within 4 week prior baseline . Previous treatment TCZ biologics ( exception criterion may grant single dose exposure upon application PI casebycase basis ) . Any previous treatment alkylating agent chlorambucil , total lymphoid irradiation . Currently take statin An intraarticular injection steroid within 6 week image Exclusions General Safety : History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction human , humanized murine monoclonal antibody . Evidence serious uncontrolled concomitant cardiovascular , nervous system , pulmonary ( include obstructive pulmonary disease ) , renal , hepatic , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ) gastrointestinal disease ( include complicate diverticulitis , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , symptomatic low GI condition might predispose perforation . ) Diagnosis liver disease elevate hepatic enzyme , define ALT , AST , &gt; 1.5 x upper limit agedetermined normal ( ULN ) total bilirubin &gt; ULN . Serum creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL ( 141 µmol/L ) female patient &gt; 1.9 mg/dL ( 168 µmol/L ) male patient . Patients serum creatinine value exceed limit may eligible study estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &gt; 30 Any history recent serious bacterial , viral , fungal , mycobacterial opportunistic infection . Have serologic evidence current past HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C. Positive QuantiFERON TB test , history tuberculosis , active TB infection without least 4 week adequate therapy TB . Active infection EBV define EBV viral load ≥ 10,000 copy per mL whole blood . Active infection CMV define CMV viral load ≥ 10,000 copy per mL whole blood . Any following hematologic abnormality , confirm repeat test : White blood count &lt; 3,000/μL &gt; 14,000/μL ; Lymphocyte count &lt; 500/μL ; Platelet count &lt; 100,000 /μL ; Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL ; Neutrophil count &lt; 2,000 cells/μL . Any major episode infection require hospitalization treatment IV antibiotic within 4 week screen oral antibiotic within 2 week prior screen . Primary secondary immunodeficiency ( history currently active ) unless relate primary disease investigation . Any medical psychological condition opinion principal investigator would interfere safe completion trial . History malignancy within 5 year prior screen , except appropriately treat carcinoma situ cervix , nonmelanoma skin carcinoma , Stage I uterine cancer . Pregnant woman nurse ( breast feeding ) mother . Patients reproductive potential willing use effective method contraception . History alcohol , drug chemical abuse within 1 year prior screen . Neuropathies condition might interfere pain evaluation unless related primary disease investigation . Rheumatic autoimmune disease RA , include SLE , MCTD , scleroderma , polymyositis , significant systemic involvement secondary RA ( e.g. , vasculitis , pulmonary fibrosis Felty 's Syndrome ) . Secondary Sjogrens syndrome RA allowable . Prior history , current inflammatory joint disease RA ( e.g. , gout , Lyme disease , seronegative spondyloarthropathy include reactive arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , arthropathy inflammatory bowel disease ) . Relatively significant radiation exposure course year prior randomization .
