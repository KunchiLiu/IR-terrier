	<brief_title>Milk Fat Intake Metabolic Health Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Saturated fat impair action insulin lead abnormally high blood sugar level characteristic diabetes . Since milk fat high saturate fat , expert advise whole dairy product ( e.g. , milk yogurt ) . However , bioactive fat , occur milk fat , may beneficial prevention diabetes . Current data provide compel evidence moderate intake saturate fat milk fat increase risk diabetes . Milk fat contains unique variety bioactive fat , may beneficial may counterbalance potential negative effect saturate fat . The investigator hypothesize milk fat favorable effect metabolic risk marker associate metabolic syndrome . Therefore , study test hypothesis milk-fat intake : ( ) result improve insulin sensitivity , ( ii ) favorably alter postprandial lipid metabolism , ( iii ) result lower circulating concentration pro-inflammatory marker . This study recruit 20-24 ( total ) female male subject blind , randomize , crossover design consist two experimental diet ( 3 week arm ) base DASH-like diet ( Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension diet ) % Energy ( E % ) : 55 E % carbohydrate , 15 E % protein , 30 E % fat ( 9 E % saturate fatty acid ( SFA ) , 15 E % monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) , 6 E % polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) ) . One experimental arm contain milk fat diet contains control fat . A washout period represent average US diet ( 48 E % carbohydrate , 15 E % protein 37 E % fat , kcal ( 16 E % SFA , 14 E % MUFA , 7 E % PUFA ) use establish level normalization fatty acid intake among subject standardize subject 's physiologic state experimental diet . The two experimental diet construct provide three serving dairy form either 1 ) regular whole ( full-fat , 3.25 % ) yogurt 2 ) fat-free yogurt supplement control fat . The diet identical term menu , macro- micronutrient , fatty acid class composition ( E % ) exception individual bioactive fatty acid , allow comparison bioactive milk fatty acid non-milk fatty acid . At end period ( initial washout period experimental diet ) frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test perform , blood take fasting lipid ( include lipoprotein profile ) , serum phospholipid fatty acid profile , inflammatory marker , stool sample examine fecal microbiota composition .</detailed_description>
