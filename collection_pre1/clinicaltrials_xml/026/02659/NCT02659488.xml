	<detailed_description>12-week , open-label LDX trial BED include fMRI assessment test follow specific prediction : 1 . At baseline , patient BED show great ventral prefrontal , striatal , amygdala brain activation high-calorie food picture ( reward ) match healthy comparison subject . 2 . After 12 week LDX treatment , BED exhibit reduce ventral prefrontal , striatal amygdala brain activation food cue compare baseline . 3 . BED patient display cessation binge eat demonstrate clinical improvement 12 week LDX treatment show great reduction ventral prefrontal , striatal , amygdala brain activation food picture patient stop binge eat improve , respectively .</detailed_description>
