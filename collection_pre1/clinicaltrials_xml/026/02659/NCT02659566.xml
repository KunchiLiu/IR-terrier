	<brief_summary>Background : Malaria disease affect many people country Mali part Africa . It cause germ spread mosquito bite . Malaria may mild , also serious lead death diagnose treat promptly . Children young 5 year pregnant woman high risk malaria . Researchers want good understand malaria infection suppress immune system . They want compare group adult receive antimalarial treatment group receive . Objective : To investigate effect antimalarial treatment begin dry season immune system malaria episode . Eligibility : Healthy adult age 18 60 live area Doneguebougou , Mali . Design : Participants screen physical exam health question . If participant find sick screen visit , get initial care study clinic free charge . They may get referral consultation . Participants randomly assign group . One group get approve antimalarial drug call Coartem . The receive . Participants Coartem group take drug 3 day . All participant blood test . Al participant see month 1 year . At visit , ask feeling examine . Blood drawn . If participant become sick time , come clinic examine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Antimalarial Treatment Measures T Cell Suppression/Regulation Healthy Adults From Doneguebougou , Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria , cause Plasmodium falciparum , devastate disease cause significant mortality morbidity directly indirectly endemic region . Lower all-cause mortality child five year age result good malaria transmission control measure endemic region . It see multiple study malaria infection , include asymptomatic carriage , suppress modulates immune system ; exactly suppression achieve unclear . Currently , effort develop long-lasting , effective vaccine combat malaria successful . One impediment concern poor immune response vaccine candidate . Understanding immunomodulatory effect malaria infection vaccine responses subsequent malaria infection thus key effort . In order understand presence parasitemia may modulate immune system , propose study effect treat portion adult volunteer treatment course artemether/lumefantrine ( Coartem ) begin dry season ( approximately January ) Ouelessebougou , Mali clear parasitemia carriage dry season follow next 12 month entire dry wet season . We enroll 50 % blood smear polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) positive volunteer distribute equally two group begin dry season , receive receive antimalarial treatment . These subject follow monthly throughout dry rainy season determine effect treatment T cell marker suppression/regulation incidence asymptomatic malaria infection clinical malaria . We hypothesize marker T cell suppression/regulation throughout dry season lower adult receive single pre-emptive treatment Coartem .</detailed_description>
