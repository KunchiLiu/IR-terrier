	<brief_summary>In Quebec , thousand worker concomitantly expose heat chemical compound . Exposure heat induces physiological response help maintain stable body temperature . Those change affect organ function implicate absorption metabolism . According literature , change could lead increased concentration chemical compound body toxicity . Therefore , aim study evaluate pulmonary absorption toxicokinetics 3 organic solvent heat stress condition volunteer expose inhalation chamber . Results use develop PBPK model allow predict organic solvent kinetics coexposed heat .</brief_summary>
