	<brief_summary>The high prevalence burden cardiometabolic disease underlie urgent need identify novel approach manage prevent cardiometabolic disease risk . This project test innovative use mobile health technology implement closed-loop feedback system collect objective patient-generated data provide clinical recommendation modify contribute health behavior . In addition improve care cardiometabolic disease , tool method develop study collect patient data provide clinical feedback could also easily adapt applied range health condition , thus highly relevant public health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Integrated Closed-loop Feedback System Pediatric Cardiometabolic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiometabolic disease - cluster medical condition risk factor include obesity , diabetes , impaired liver function , increase risk child adult-onset cardiovascular disease - represent major population-wide health burden United States . Management cardiometabolic disease also impose substantial financial burden economy tie significant healthcare resource . It well-known many lifestyle health behavior contribute cardiometabolic disease difficult modify establish , childhood represent opportune time promote healthy behavior . Patient-centered outcome research ( PCOR ) identify certain health behavior important actionable modify cardiometabolic risk , namely weight management , physical activity , screen-time , sleep , consumption sugar-sweetened beverage . Mobile health technology ( mHealth ) could use monitor counsel common health behavior associate cardiometabolic risk , may facilitate inclusion PCOR evidence cardiometabolic disease clinical practice . The overall goal research use mHealth technology accelerate uptake PCOR finding treatment cardiometabolic disease . To achieve goal , study develop novel set mHealth tool capable collect health behavior information determine extent provide clinical feedback health behavior improve obesity health behavior among child age 6-12 year family . In study develop , implement , test comparative clinical effectiveness closed-loop feedback system collect patient data provide recommendation . The specific aim study : 1 ) develop integrated closed-loop feedback system incorporate longitudinal mHealth data manage cardiometabolic disease among at-risk family , 2 ) determine extent integrate closed-loop system provide feedback objective patient-generated data improve cardiometabolic risk , measure change body mass index health behavior include , physical activity , screen-time , sleep , sugar-sweetened beverage consumption . This research develop novel mHealth tool approach allow healthcare provider patient well understand disease risk improve disease management collect patient data 1 ) repeatedly time , 2 ) simultaneously , 3 ) objectively . This study innovative use mHealth tool simultaneously collect longitudinal data multiple health behavior know associated cardiometabolic risk , offer new approach implement disseminate PCOR finding via novel closed-loop feedback system . The high prevalence cardiometabolic disease make innovative closed-loop system relevant public health . The mHealth tool method develop study collect patient data provide clinical feedback could also easily adapt applied range health condition .</detailed_description>
