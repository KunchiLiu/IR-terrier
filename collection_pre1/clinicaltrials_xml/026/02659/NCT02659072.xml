	<brief_title>Infectious Risk Vaginal Ultrasound Examination : Evaluation Modeling From Human Papillomavirus ( HPV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevention infection Endo Vaginal sonography . Brief Summary Background Trans vaginal sonography ( TVS ) widely use obstetrics gynecology . Because relative lack data , universal agreement prevent transmission pathogens risk infection TVS . Whereas American guideline stringent , French health authority recommend low-level disinfection probe two patient use probe cover , intermediate level disinfection least daily case visible contamination probe , rupture probe cover . For couple gel , guideline agree whether sterile . Transmitting infectious agent may result variety cause : failure disinfect probe , contaminate gel , contamination probe cover due incorrect manipulation failure comply hand wash disinfection . Due resistance disinfection , high prevalence , potential oncogenic role , use HPV marker presence pathogen probe , probe cover , environment . Objectives Primary objective : assess presence HPV bare probe probe probe-cover routine practice Secondary objective : 1 . - To assess compliance guideline prevention pathogens 2 . - To identify factor associate presence HPV probe 2a Factors related procedure Compliance disinfection guideline prior perform TVS Rank procedure since last daily midlevel disinfection Presence HPV ultrasound machine key board , proxy environment 2b Factors related center TVS perform Compliance daily disinfection guideline Traceability disinfection process Type center ( emergency clinic /planned session / obstetrics / gynecology /IVF monitoring ) 3 - To estimate incidence probe cover rupture visible probe contamination bodily fluids 4 - To model cost effectiveness strategy disinfection Methods Type study : observational survey Main outcome criterion : Percentage 95 % confidence interval TVS procedure - bare probe positive HPV - cover probe positive HPV Statistical unit : procedure survey Viral assay HPV DNA detection perform sample ( keyboard , bare cover probe ) use cobasÂ® HPV Test Kit ( Roche ) : This test allow detect presence cellular DNA DNA 14 high-risk HPV ( genotypes 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 66 68 ) specifically identify presence HPV16 18 . In case positive result bare cover probe , detection HPV complete episomal genome perform , circular HPV DNA amplify use polymerase whch selectively amplify circular double-stranded DNA specific degenerate HPV primer . The amplicons sequence use specific HPV primer GP5 + / GP6 + ( MARINCEVIC Y-Zuniga et al , 2012 , Virology ) . Secondary outcome criterion Percentage procedure keyboard positive HPV Percentage procedures visible rupture probe cover Percentage procedure visibly taint probes Percentage procedure visible rupture probe cover previous procedure Percentage procedure visibly taint probe previous procedure Percentage presence disinfection guideline item since last procedure probe test presence HPV Percentage center write protocol comply disinfection guideline Percentage center traceability disinfection procedure . Number observation : 1000 TVS procedure Inclusion criterion : Any TVS perform participate center observation session Exclusion criterion : TVS invasive procedure . Patient refusal Center selection : private public center Ile de France region , perform TVS routinely , volunteer enroll . Perspectives Evaluating presence HPV TVS probe relation actual behavior professional routine practice help u model risk transmit pathogen TVS may contribute establish prevention guideline</detailed_description>
