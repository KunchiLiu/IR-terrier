	<detailed_description>Forty individual ( 19 male 21 female ; age range : 18-35 year ) enrol study . Based remain tissue donor site free gingival graft harvesting , individual divide two group : 1.0-1.9 millimeter ( mm ) remain tissue donor site harvesting ( n = 20 ) , 2-2.9 mm remain tissue donor site harvesting . Tissue fill defect area three point ( mesial , central distal ) measure various time-points ( baseline , post-operative 1 , 3 , 6 month ) .</detailed_description>
