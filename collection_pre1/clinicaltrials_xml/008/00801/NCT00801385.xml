	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Sorafenib may also stop growth non-small cell lung cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving sorafenib together erlotinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give sorafenib together erlotinib work treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer respond chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess response rate sorafenib tosylate combination erlotinib hydrochloride patient stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer refractory 1 2 prior chemotherapy regimen . Secondary - To assess response duration patient treat regimen . - To assess disease control rate patient treat regimen . - To assess progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - To assess overall survival patient treat regimen . - To assess safety tolerability regimen patient . - To analyze biomarkers , include evaluation EGFR expression , mutational analysis EGFR K-ras , immunohistochemical analysis EGFR downstream pathway ( phospho-EGFR , phospho-AKT , phospho-Erk , phospho-STAT3 ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tissue sample analyze nucleic acid level EGFR mutation ( exon 18-21 ) K-ras mutation ( exon 2 ) , DNA mutation via PCR , presence EGFR protein IHC , downstream effector EGFR activation IHC . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
