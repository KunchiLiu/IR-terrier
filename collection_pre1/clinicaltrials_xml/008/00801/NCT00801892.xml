	<brief_summary>Daily physical activity important achieve glucose control person type 2 diabetes . The purpose study explore obstructive sleep apnea daytime symptom , excessive sleepiness , act barrier physical activity . We examine treatment obstructive sleep apnea continuous positive airway pressure result increase physical activity person type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) serious disorder characterize episodic obstruction pharyngeal airway accompany cessation reduction airflow . Untreated OSA negative impact 24 hour day , disrupt nighttime sleep cause excessive daytime sleepiness interfere function . Recent study suggest OSA type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) co-exist OSA may adversely affect glucose homeostasis . While physical activity recognize beneficial person T2DM , OSA severity daytime sleepiness may act hind person T2DM participate physical activity . The primary aim pilot/feasibility study obtain preliminary data facilitate hypothesis development enhance feasibility conduct double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study examine physical activity subject T2DM OSA treat CPAP compare subject sham-CPAP . The secondary aim explore : 1 ) interrelationship OSA severity , daytime sleepiness , physical activity glucose variability baseline ; 2 ) average pre-post therapy change glucose variability subject treat CPAP compare subject receive sham-CPAP , 3 ) pre post therapy change weight , diet , residual sleepiness mood subject treat CPAP compare subject receive sham-CPAP . The primary endpoint study , physical activity , measure Bodymedia SenseWear Pro Armband® determine activity count . The endpoint glucose variability measure Medtronic Continuous Glucose Monitoring System ( CGMS ) . Adherence CPAP measure Smart Card® insert subject ' CPAP machine . We limit sample subject randomize CPAP sham-CPAP person adequate sleep duration pre-treatment ( &gt; 6 hour ) , moderate severe OSA EDS homogenous , profoundly affect sample pilot study . The information result propose study effect OSA EDS glucose variability potential lead development improve behavioral intervention person diabetes . In addition , study contains measure diet mood begin elucidate possible effect OSA EDS diabetes management .</detailed_description>
