	<brief_summary>A recent trial adult demonstrate zinc ( Zn ) Multiminerals ( MN ) combine , neither alone , significantly increase weight gain Tuberculosis ( TB ) treatment . There substantially large beneficial effect survival amongst receive combination Zn MN compare receive either Zn alone MN alone . These excite preliminary finding require confirmation , data mortality reduction base post-hoc subgroup-analysis . Effects MN Zn supplementation assess child TB . Studies urgently need evaluate therapeutic potential nutritional intervention treatment outcome child TB . Simple inexpensive nutritional intervention may substantially impact TB-related child morbidity mortality high-burden setting . The investigator thus , propose randomize , double blind , control trial measure effect multi-vitamin/mineral supplementation efficacy anti-TB treatment newly diagnose childhood pulmonary TB patient Delhi .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan randomize controlled trial study impact multimineral supplement antituberculosis drug freshly diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis child . Plan enrol 400 child two site Delhi . The diagnosis treatment pulmonary tuberculosis base recommendation Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program ( RNTCP ) . The outcome measure form weight gain improvement x ray film chest . The secondary outcome variable follow : 1 . Effect micronutrient supplement 2 6 month anthropometric parameter compare mean anthropometric parameter different group . 2 . Improvement radiological finding 2 month : Comparing proportion child show clearance X ray film baseline 6 month two paediatrician independently use protocol . 3 . Resolution symptoms 2 6 month : By compare proportion patient resolution present symptom ( fever , cough , appetite improvement ) report parent 4 . Proportion child require extension intensive phase therapy : Comparing proportion child different group require extension intensive phase therapy 2 month due treat physician 's decision . 5 . Interferon gamma response M. tuberculosis antigens ESAT6 CF10 quantiferon assay baseline , 2 month 6 month treatment 6 . To study effect zinc supplementation ocular toxicity child receive ethambutol VER 7 . To document drug resistance ( S , I , R , E ) pattern among child culture confirm TB 8 . To document genotypic strain diversity among child culture confirm TB , also association strain type disease severity and/or drug resistance 9 . To document spectrum mycobacterial specie culture child clinically suspect pulmonary tuberculosis .</detailed_description>
