	<brief_title>Combined Kidney Bone Marrow Transplantation Prevent Kidney Transplant Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient receive organ tissue transplant must take special medicine know `` immunosuppressive drug '' order prevent immune system reject transplant . These drug effective , leave patient increase risk serious infection certain type cancer . New method prevent transplant rejection need . Researchers find transplant bone marrow kidney donor create call `` mixed chimerism . '' This mean transplant recipient mixture donor recipient 's immune system . It believe mixture immune cell prevent rejection kidney . In small prior study , perform kidney transplant together bone marrow transplant donor allow 4 5 patient stop take immunosuppressive drug altogether , without reject transplant . This clinical trial study patient confirm technique safe effective . Patients eligible study must candidate live kidney transplant , eligible donor identify . The transplant recipient donor must consent participate study . Transplant recipient enrol study receive kidney bone marrow transplant live donor . Prior transplant procedure , transplant recipient undergo `` condition regimen '' prepares immune system recipient 's immune ( bone marrow ) cell . This condition regimen combination chemotherapy , radiation , immunosuppressive drug specialize medication call rituximab MEDI-507 . MEDI-507 investigational medication approve FDA . After transplant procedure , transplant recipient prescribe steroid several week immunosuppressive drug . After 2 month , dose immunosuppressive drug slowly decrease zero patient whose immune system kidney function meet certain criterion . Transplant recipient enrol study hospitalize 1 week prior transplant procedure . After transplant , patient remain hospital doctor feel well enough go home . Recipients receive approximately monthly checkup period 2 year transplant , plus checkup 2 ½ , 3 , 3 ½ , 4 , 5 year transplant . Checkups include physical exam , blood urine test assess immune system kidney function . At four checkup , kidney biopsy request . Transplant donor enrol study attend screen visit , include physical exam , blood test chest x-ray . Eligible donor admit hospital 3-5 day , bone marrow collect prior removal kidney . Transplant donor may ask later date donate additional blood sample research purpose .</detailed_description>
