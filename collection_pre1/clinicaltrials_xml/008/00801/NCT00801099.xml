	<brief_summary>In rural hospital Tanzania rate surgical site infection ( SSI ) 21.6 % . Inappropriate choice antibiotic administration time determine sole risk factor set . After implementation standardized procedure single shot dose Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid approximately 30 min . preoperatively rate SSI drop 80 % spite procedural risk factor like poor hygiene etc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical Site Infections ( SSIs ) important socioeconomic impact prolong period hospitalization rehabilitation . Patients SSIs five time likely readmitted even twice likely die compare patient similar intervention without SSI . In non-industrialized country , incidence SSIs high consequence SSI even severe : Many hospital lack appropriate facility early diagnosis treatment . In addition , microbiological identification pathogen susceptibility test rarely available , prerequisite target treatment SSIs . Overcrowding understaffing additional risk factor SSIs , common country . A study conduct local surgeon ' suggestion 82-bed department general surgery , obstetrics gynecology , urology orthopedics St. Francis Designated District Hospital ( SFDDH ) Ifakara ( Southern Tanzania ) show SSI-rate 21.6 % . The analysis study identify two major risk factor SSI clean clean-contaminated surgical procedure : Inadequate time administration routine antimicrobial prophylaxis ( AMP ) inappropriate selection antibiotic cover commonly observe pathogen . Therefore , intervention study discuss local surgeon charge improve selection time routine AMP thereby reduce rate SSIs . The study design objective present staff general meeting special duty responsibility discuss individual colleague . Furthermore distributed pocket flow sheet involved staff hung laminate flow sheet theatre .</detailed_description>
