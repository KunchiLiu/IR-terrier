	<brief_title>Bilicurves : Using Information Technology Improve Management Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2004 , American Academy Pediatrics disseminate clinical practice guideline management neonatal hyperbilirubinemia . Using infant 's age hour , serum bilirubin level apply hour-specific nomogram ass risk develop significant hyperbilirubinemia well necessity treatment . Prior guideline include nomograms either . A system approach manage neonatal hyperbilirubinemia , include use nomogram , show improve outcome patient safety . Despite existence guideline , decision support exist within MGH clinical information system manage neonatal hyperbilirubinemia . We propose create BiliCurves , application integrates perinatal information obstetrical health record newborn 's , provide seamless report neonatal bilirubin result context practice guideline relevant obstetrical data . BiliCurves graphically superimpose bilirubin result onto hour-specific guideline nomograms provider view view bilirubin result . We propose randomize BiliCurves access pediatric provider , study effect management hyperbilirubinemia birth hospitalization well outpatient set discharge . We hypothesize infant treat physician BiliCurves access receive birth hospitalization phototherapy high rate readmission hyperbilirubinemia low rate control group . We also hypothesize physician BiliCurves access report great ease confidence nomogram use provide evidence-based care BiliCurves obviate provider access paper base version nomogram ( usual care ) well decrease potential error plot test result nomogram .</detailed_description>
