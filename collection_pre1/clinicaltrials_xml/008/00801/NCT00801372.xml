	<brief_summary>Induced pluripotent stem cell potentially may useful future unlimited source cell transplantation . The major goal project develop human iPS cell exist line fibroblast originally donate clinical grade feeder development clinical grade hESCs . The clinical grade feeder develop aborted fetus , foreskin umbilical cord .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Existing Fibroblast Cells Convert Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The potential reprogram somatic cell embryonic state raise multiple basic research question related process reprogramming property iPS cell . We use various approach study molecular mechanism process occur reprogramming . We use various experimental system characterize study property iPS cell , biology , developmental potential , capability give rise functional differentiate progeny etc . The clinical grade donate feeder use project develop GMP condition use animal-free reagent . For potential future clinical application , iPS cell develop GMP condition , use reagent method acceptable clinical application .</detailed_description>
