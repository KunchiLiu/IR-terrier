	<brief_summary>Induced pluripotent stem cell potentially may useful future unlimited source cell transplantation . The major goal project develop human iPS cell various type cell culture line exist collection . The IPS cell develop model disease , develop technology may eventually allow use IPS cell transplantation therapy , basic research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The potential reprogram somatic cell embryonic state raise multiple basic research question related process reprogramming property iPS cell . We use various approach study molecular mechanism process occur reprogramming . We use various experimental system characterize study property iPS cell , biology , developmental potential , capability give rise functional differentiate progeny etc . We induce differentiation iPS cell towards specific cell lineages progeny use study pathogenesis disease . They use develop new therapeutic approach high throughput screen factor potential toxic therapeutic effect . All sample non-identified .</detailed_description>
