	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Denileukin diftitox safe , well tolerate induce significant overall response alone combination chemotherapy : ifosfamide , carboplatin etoposide ( ICE ) safe well tolerate population child , adolescent young adult relapse refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Denileukine Diftitox Relapsed ALCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite significant progress treatment outcome childhood ALCL , prognosis child develop progressive recurrent disease poor &lt; 30 % DFS . Novel therapy urgently need subgroup patient . One potential approach investigation new class receptor target cytotoxic fusion protein ( denileukin diftitox { DD } ) . We previously demonstrate &gt; 85 % child ALCL express CD25 . The human IL-2 receptor exist three form , low ( CD25 ) , intermediate ( CD122/CD132 ) high ( CD25/CD122/CD132 ) affinity . DD recombinant DNA-derived cytotoxic fusion protein compose amino acid sequence diphtheria toxin fragment follow binding sequence interleukin-2 receptor . Malignant cell express one subunits IL-2 receptor find certain leukemias lymphoma include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . Clinical study show therapeutic efficacy DD alone combination CHOP chemotherapy CD25 express malignancy CTCL , CLL lymphoma . We hypothesize DD safe efficacious child relapse ALCL .</detailed_description>
