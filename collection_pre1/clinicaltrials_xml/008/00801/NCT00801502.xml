	<brief_summary>The number infant child allergic disease ( dermatitis , allergy , asthma ) increase last several decade . This may relate change diet . It think child become sensitised allergen early life maybe even bear . Some study show high omega-3 fat intake mother decrease risk sensitisation baby . There biological mechanism explain . Omega-3 fat find oily fish like salmon . In UK pregnant woman recommend eat oily fish twice per week . However , consumption oily fish know low pregnant woman UK . This study set identify effect increase salmon intake pregnant woman . The hypothesis investigate : increase consumption oily fish pregnancy woman risk offspring develop atopy increase omega-3 fat antioxidant status develop baby ameliorate development atopic marker manifestation infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence childhood atopic disease ( eczema , rhinitis [ hay-fever ] , asthma , allergy ) increase dramatically last 30 year . This must due environmental change . Dietary change believe important causative factor three diet relate hypothesis propose . The first ( `` PUFA hypothesis '' ) increase intake n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) last 30 year result absolute relative decline intake n-3 PUFA , especially long chain n-3 PUFA . There plausible biological mechanism whereby high n-6 n-3 PUFA ratio would skew immune system favour sensitisation allergen . The second diet hypothesis ( `` antioxidant hypothesis '' ) low status antioxidant vitamins mineral 30 year ago result increase oxidant stress skews immune system favour sensitisation allergen . The third diet hypothesis ( `` gut microflora hypothesis '' ) mature microflora within intestinal tract neonate play role development atopy interaction gut immune system . Factors influence development neonatal gut microflora include maternal gut microflora infant diet ( e.g . breast milk composition ) . Since maternal diet affect maternal gut microflora also breast milk composition link suggest modification maternal diet pregnancy development atopy infant effect gut microflora . It recognise sensitisation allergen trigger atopic disease occur early life , many case utero [ 4 ] . Thus , likely maternal diet pregnancy important influencing risk atopic disease child . There much evidence n-3 PUFA status lower plasma , erythrocytes , white cell milk mother atopic child also umbilical cord plasma erythrocytes [ 5 ] . Likewise , status antioxidant mineral ( e.g . Se ) cord blood report low child go develop atopic disease . Finally , atopic infant different gut microflora non-atopic infant . These study suggest maternal status n-3 PUFA antioxidant , possible certain gut microbe , important determine atopic outcome child . Not surprisingly therefore , substantial interest supplementation study pregnant woman , particularly whose baby risk atopic disease ( e.g . family history ) . Fish , especially oily fish like salmon , fish oil good source long chain n-3 PUFA . A recent study investigate effect fish oil supplementation pregnant woman report alteration cytokine profile umbilical cord plasma consistent protection towards atopy . The study go demonstrate reduce severity atopic dermatitis decrease likelihood skin-prick positivity variety common allergens child one year age . Oily fish represent unique opportunity reduce atopy risk rich source n-3 PUFA antioxidant mineral ( Se ) . They represent attractive option supplementation fish oil capsule . Pregnant woman low intake fish . Current UK recommendation `` woman reproductive age aim consume within range one two portion oily fish week '' . The upper limit range recommendation make boy , men woman reproductive age . This concern contaminants specie oily fish ( e.g . tuna ) . Aquaculture produce salmon low contaminant level therefore ideal solution enable oily fish consumption pregnant woman . Consumption tailor-made salmon pregnant woman could prevent development atopic disease child . It important assess well-designed rigorous intervention study relate maternal oily fish consumption atopic disease offspring , time assess effect maternal fish consumption fetal growth maternal fetal body composition . Hypothesis : Increased consumption oily fish pregnancy woman risk offspring develop atopy increase n-3 PUFA antioxidant status develop baby ameliorate development atopic marker manifestation infant . Objectives : 1 . To conduct dietary intervention study pregnant woman use long chain n-3 PUFA-rich salmon . 2 . To determine effect increase consumption oily fish pregnancy fetal growth adaptation maternal fetal body composition . 3 . To determine effect increase consumption oily fish pregnancy maternal fetal ( i.e . cord blood ) nutrient status 4 . To determine effect increase consumption oily fish pregnancy maternal fetal ( i.e . cord blood ) immune status 5 . To determine effect increase consumption oily fish pregnancy predictor atopic disease cord blood , development atopic disease infancy .</detailed_description>
