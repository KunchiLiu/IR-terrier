	<brief_summary>Awkward posture computer keyboard use hypothesize one cause musculoskeletal pain/discomfort well musculoskeletal disorder upper extremity ( MSD-UE ) . Alternative computer keyboard purport reduce musculoskeletal pain/discomfort show change aspect keyboard user ' kinematics laboratory condition . However , research examine effectiveness alternative keyboard reduce musculoskeletal pain/discomfort workplace equivocal , study examine association posture musculoskeletal pain . The Aims 3-year prospective double cross-over trial : 1 ) To examine effectiveness alternative keyboard reduce report pain 6-months ; 2 ) To examine neutrality stability posture keyboard use ; 3 ) To identify posture associate low level musculoskeletal pain . Seventy-five computer user randomly assign one two keyboard use order : Group 1 - AB ( standard keyboard , alternative keyboard ) ; Group 2 - BA ( alternative keyboard , standard keyboard ) . All subject use assigned keyboard 6-months switch next keyboard . Every week , subject report musculoskeletal pain level . Just prior 6-month intervention subject ' kinematics performance keyboard record worksite use Keyboard - Personal Computing Style ( K-PeCS ) instrument laboratory set use 3-dimensional motion capture technology . Aim 1 : To examine effectiveness alternative keyboard reduce pain 6-months . Hypothesis 1 ( H-1 ) - At six month subject use alternative keyboard significantly low musculoskeletal pain level use standard keyboard . Aim 2 : To examine neutrality stability posture keyboard use . Hypothesis 3 ( H-2 ) - Subjects use alternative keyboard significantly neutral posture use standard keyboard baseline 6 month Hypothesis 3 ( H-3 ) - Subjects 6-months keyboarding posture remain equivalent keyboarding posture document baseline .</brief_summary>
