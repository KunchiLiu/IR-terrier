The off-treatment period ( ) start prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ≤4 ng/mL last 24 month base PSA level . A visit schedule monthly basis induction treatment period , every two month off-treatment period . During off-treatment period , degarelix treatment re-initiated PSA &gt; 4 ng/mL . The maximum degarelix IAD treatment cycle participant could receive limited three .</detailed_description>
