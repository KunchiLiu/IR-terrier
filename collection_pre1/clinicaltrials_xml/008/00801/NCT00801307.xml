	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Effect He/O2 Medical Air Pulmonary Function Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two type measurement perform three evaluated gas : - pulmonary function measurement rest establish resistance airflow reproducible way , include measurement Inspiratory Capacity ( IC ) , Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , Forced Expiratory Flows ( FEF ) different lung volume ( 25 75 % vital capacity ) , Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) , - Tidal Volume ( TV ) measure rest light cycle exercise . The result study useful evaluate extent influence gas concentration , since none previous trial perform He/O2 65:35 , well extent influence lung disease , since none previous trial perform asthmatic patient various disease stage . The work hypothesis use He/O2 mixtures 78:22 65:35 , flow resistance decrease compare medical air low density helium replaces nitrogen , thus result low workload breathe asthmatic COPD patient . For patient reduced pulmonary function , difference might result great Inspiratory Capacity . That Inspiratory Capacity measure primary efficacy criterion , also Tidal Volume pulmonary function parameter 3 type subjects/patients : - healthy volunteer , - patient moderate severe persistent asthma , - patient moderate severe COPD .</detailed_description>
