	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize regular monitoring BIA add value management fluid status PD patient Objectives study : The objective show patient additional information body composition available clinician ECFv maintain within pre-agreed limit , ~ 1 liter , observation period 12 month . SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : Low peritoneal ultrafiltration , inference low sodium removal , associate bad outcome PD . Equally , excessive fluid removal risk factor dehydration loss residual renal function . Current guideline advocate daily UF volume 1litre ; blunt application could lead either inappropriate early loss residual function modality transfer . There significant need evidence best manage fluid status PD patient , term appropriate clinical strategy also simple reproducible tool guide clinician apply strategy . It likely BIA become standard tool aid clinician assess fluid status . It simple perform , intervention study demonstrate ability identify change fluid status response change therapy powerful predictor patient survival . There , however clear need stage proof principle study establish true potential add value routine management patient . Body composition change spontaneously time PD . Short term change hydration ( specifically extracellular fluid volume , ECFv ) combine medium term change muscle fat make difficult clinician sure fluid status stable . It anticipate regular BIA measurement aid clinician manage problem monitoring weight fluid status . By randomize patient two group regular BIA measurement , one BIA data available clinician possible see spontaneous change body composition account .</brief_summary>
