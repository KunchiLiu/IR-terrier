	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death UK , lead 34 000 death year ( 22 % cancer death ) . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) common histology , account approximately 80 % case present advanced , stage IIIb IV disease . The recommended treatment advance disease doublet platinum-based chemotherapy , although survival benefit modest . Even among fit enough chemotherapy , response rate 20-40 % , median survival average 9-10 month newer platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen ( Schiller et al , 2002 ; Rudd et al , 2005 ; Lee et al , 2007 ) . Only 11 % patient go survive 2 year treat new gemcitabine/carboplatin regimen establish London Lung Cancer Group ( Rudd et al , 2005 ; Lee et al , 2007 ) . New strategy need improve prognosis disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ERCC1 Targeted Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRIAL OBJECTIVES Primary objective The trial two main objective : - To detect improvement survival ERCC1+ve patient treat non-platinum chemotherapy compare platinum-based treatment . - To establish non-inferiority improvement survival ERCC1-ve patient treat platinum-based chemotherapy compare non-platinum treatment . Secondary objective - To examine progression-free survival , response rate quality life two treatment regimen , accord ERCC1 status . - To investigate whether treatment effect differs accord histology ( squamous vs. nonsquamous ) ; gender ( male vs. female ) ; performance status - To undertake cost-effectiveness analysis base patient , accord ERCC1 status .</detailed_description>
