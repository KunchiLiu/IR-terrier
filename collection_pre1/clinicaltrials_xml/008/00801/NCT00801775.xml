	<brief_title>Improved Diagnosis Peritoneal Dialysis Peritonitis Calorimetry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Peritonitis still consider important complication peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) associate high mortality , therapy failure , healthcare expense . We recently demonstrate peritonitis continuous common reason technical failure PD contribute equally early late failure ; 12 279 patient die consequence PD associate peritonitis . The diagnosis peritonitis typically base clinical symptom , reflect already advanced state inflammation disease . Since implementation blood culture system detection bacterial growth PD effluent ten year ago , considerable progress make improve diagnosis PD associate peritonitis . In PD population 36 219 ( 16 % ) infectious peritonitis episodes culture-negative . Usually , detection time microorganisms require least 12 hour time pathogen identification 48 hour . Rapidly divide cell bacteria produce heat , measure calorimetry . As recently show , research group , calorimetry allow rapid accurate diagnosis bacterial growth case meningitis contaminate platelet . In pilot experiment , could show potential feasibility calorimetry early accurate detection microorganism PD fluid . Hypothesis aim : We hypothesize calorimetry PD effluent significantly improve diagnosis PD associate peritonitis early accurate detection pathogen . As compare traditional culture method , calorimetry may ( ) short time positivity ( ii ) high sensitivity without loss specificity . Specific aim evaluate calorimetry : ( ) rapid detection microorganism compare conventional blood culture , ( ii ) superior , regard sensitivity specificity , detection PD associate peritonitis compare standard blood culture system ( iii ) valuable tool pathogen identification specific heat signal `` signature '' receive calorimetry . The Primary endpoint time positivity bacterial growth calorimetry conventional blood culture . The secondary endpoint accuracy ( i.e . sensitivity specificity ) detection rate microorganism PD fluid rate consistency pathogen identification calorimetry curve conventional microbiological method . Research plan : After obtain informed consent , prospectively include open-labeled comparative study patient age 16 year old , perform PD University Hospital time period January 2009 December 2011 . PD fluid submit conventional screening examination ( cell count differential ) calorimetry ( sterile MonovetteR tube ) routine visit . If PD peritonitis suspect , PD fluid also inoculate aerobic anaerobic culture bottle bedside sterile condition , bottle 10 ml PD fluid . For calorimetry , 1 ml PD fluid cultivate 37Â°C calorimeter tube , contain 2 ml trypticase soy broth ( TSB ) . Conventional culture bottle calorimeter tube incubate total 6 day , culture and/or calorimetry regard negative . Medical record prospectively abstract demographic characteristic , clinical , radiographic , laboratory microbiological data use standardized case report form . The sample size calculation perform separately primary secondary endpoint follow setting : 0.05 , power 80 % , two-sided test . To reach statistical significant difference primary endpoint , 286 sample require study . For secondary endpoint p0 = 80 % ( sensitivity conventional blood culture ) , p1 = 95 % ( sensitivity calorimetry culture ) , 255 sample require . With expect drop-out rate 5 % , approximately 300 sample need . With expect 120-180 samples/year study duration approximately 2.5 3 year need . Expected outcome : We anticipate calorimetry significantly improve diagnosis PD-associated peritonitis . First ( primary endpoint ) , predict early pathogen detection calorimetry ; second ( secondary endpoint ) , expect increase sensitivity 15 % without loss specificity ( &gt; 90 % ) . Furthermore , assume important pathogen , see PD population ( i.e . S. aureus , coagulase-negative staphylococci , streptococci , enterobacteriaceae ) may identify within 12 hour ( compare &gt; 48 hour conventional microbiological method ) accuracy 80 % . The ultra-sensitive calorimetry technique may diagnose PD associate peritonitis early disease stage high accuracy . This would basis rapid target antibiotic therapy , may significantly influence outcome patient .</detailed_description>
