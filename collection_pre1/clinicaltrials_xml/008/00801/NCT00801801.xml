	<brief_title>Study Low Dose Chemotherapy Plus Sorafenib Initial Therapy Patients With Advanced Non-Squamous Cell NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The median survival untreated advanced stage NSCLC 5-6 month ( 2,3 ) . Patients poor performance status due malignancy co-morbidities poorer survival . This group patient underrepresented clinical trial may receive chemotherapy due fear increase toxicity systemic chemotherapy . The overall median survival patient advance NSCLC treat first-line platinum-based doublet le 12 month ( 8 10 month ) 1-year 2-year survival rate 33 % 11 % , respectively ( 4 6 ) . No chemotherapy regimen significant advantage others treatment advance NSCLC . Agents target epidermal growth factor receptor , matrix metalloproteinase , farnesyl transferase , protein kinase C retinoic X receptor far show survival benefit combination chemotherapy advance NSCLC ( 7-13 ) . Docetaxel activity NSCLC first line second line setting . In poor performance status patient elderly patient , single agent chemotherapy recommend . Weekly docetaxel administration well tolerate less incidence hematologic toxicity difference overall survival compare patient receive high dos ( 75 mg/m2 ) q 3 week ( 14-18 ) . There increase need better strategy improve survival well reduce regimen relate toxicity large group patient . The use target therapy well low dose-protracted chemotherapy ( metronomic chemotherapy ) need evaluation therapy well toxicity profile . Sorafenib ( BAY 49-bursts toxic maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) chemotherapy intersperse long break , shift think towards view compress accelerated schedule drug administration use much small individual dos MTD would effective ; term reduce certain toxicity , perhaps even improve antitumor effect well . Moreover , dosing/scheduling strategy ideally suit combine chemotherapeutic agent many new target biologic drug . The recent refinement concept call `` metronomic '' chemotherapy , refers frequent administration cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent dose significantly MTD , prolong drug-free break .</detailed_description>
