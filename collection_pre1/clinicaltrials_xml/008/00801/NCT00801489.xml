	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn idarubicin added combination fludarabine , cytarabine , Neupogen ( Filgrastim ) without increase risk side effect . This study also look whether addition idarubicin increase long-term chance patient remain disease free .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine , Cytarabine , Filgrastim Idarubicin Core Binding Factor ( CBF ) Leukemias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Fludarabine design make cancer cell less able repair damage DNA ( genetic material cell ) . This may increase likelihood cell die . Cytarabine design insert DNA stop DNA repair . Filgrastim promote growth white blood cell , help fight infection . Decitabine Idarubicin design damage DNA ( genetic material ) cell , may cause cancer cell die . Parts Study : There 2 part study . The first part study call induction therapy . During induction , study doctor try get rid leukemia cell bone marrow . If induction cause leukemia cell remove bone marrow blood count return normal , remission . Induction usually last 4-6 week . If remission , begin second part study , call post-remission therapy . You receive 4-6 cycle ( 1 cycle every 4-6 week ) post-remission therapy , depend blood count . Each study cycle last 4-6 week . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , induction therapy , give fludarabine cytarabine needle vein every day , 5 day row ( Days 1-5 ) . You receive fludarabine 30 minute cytarabine 4 hour . Filgrastim give one time daily injection skin start day receive fludarabine cytarabine , continue receive filgrastim one time daily white blood cell count near normal . You receive idarubicin needle vein 30 minute Days 3 4 right receive fludarabine . During post-remission therapy , receive fludarabine cytarabine 3 day ( Days 1-3 ) instead 5 day . You receive idarubicin dose give induction therapy Days 2 3 . You receive idarubicin one time Cycles 3-6 post-remission therapy . You receive filgrastim one time day post-remission cycle . During post-remission therapy , may begin receive decitabine instead fludarabine , cytarabine , filgrastim , and/or idarubicin 60 year old , intolerable side effect . If doctor think best interest , begin receive decitabine infusion 1 hour , 5 day row , every 4-6 week 12 cycle . The doctor discus . Study Visits : During induction therapy , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw least week routine testing . After 3 week ( Between Days 18-24 ) , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . If leukemia cell completely go bone marrow end 3 week , study doctor may decide repeat test . If repeat bone marrow aspirate show remission , study doctor may decide give another cycle induction therapy . Once begin post-remission therapy , follow test procedure : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , include weight . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status ) . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine blood test . At Months 4 7 , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . Part bone marrow sample collect bone marrow aspiration send M. D. Anderson molecular lab test . If study doctor think necessary , may bone marrow aspirate first 7 month check status disease . Length Study : You study one cycle induction therapy 6 cycle post-remission therapy . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Long-term follow : You blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine testing every 6 month 2 year study . This investigational study . Cytarabine FDA approve commercially available treatment AML . Fludarabine FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Filgrastim FDA approve commercially available treat fever associate low white cell count patient AML . Idarubicin FDA approve commercially available treatment acute leukemia , lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease breast cancer . At time , use combination research purpose . Decitabine FDA approve treatment myelodysplastic syndrome commercially available . Up 180 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
