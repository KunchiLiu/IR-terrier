	<brief_title>Exploratory Study Iocide Oral Rinse Diabetic Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind prospective pilot study evaluate effect investigational oral rinse adjunctive agent non-surgical periodontal intervention patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . Approximately thirty ( 30 ) adult ( 35 year old ) patient type 2 diabetes mellitus untreated chronic periodontitis moderate bad severity enrol 6-month study provide 24 evaluable subject ( 12 per group ) . All subject enrol trial receive standard periodontal therapy include scale root planing ( SRP ) . Half randomize receive investigational oral rinse adjunctively twice daily ; half receive placebo rinse twice daily . Study participant treat either Iocide placebo rinse first 90 day study . Follow examination perform six month . Evaluation biological marker associate systemic inflammation diabetes perform baseline , three month , six month . The primary study outcome clinical measurement chronic periodontitis ( gingival index , bleed probing , probe depth , clinical attachment level ) . Secondary outcome change HbA1c marker systemic inflammation measure serum C-reactive protein , plasma TNF-a , IL-6 .</detailed_description>
