	<brief_summary>Inherited deficiency one 3 gene ( surfactant protein B , surfactant protein C , ATP-binding cassette transporter A3 ) cause neonatal respiratory distress syndrome disrupt metabolism pulmonary surfactant . The investigator use state art method link specific change genetic code gene disruption discrete step metabolism pulmonary surfactant human newborn infant . These study lead improve diagnostic capability suggest novel strategy correct surfactant deficiency newborn infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Genetic regulation neonatal pulmonary surfactant deficiency suggest study gender , genetic linkage , recurrent familial case , target gene ablation murine lineage , racial disparity risk neonatal respiratory distress syndrome . Successful fetal-neonatal pulmonary transition require production pulmonary surfactant , phospholipid-protein film line alveoli maintains alveolar patency end expiration . Our goal understand genetic mechanism disrupt pulmonary surfactant metabolism cause neonatal respiratory distress syndrome . Studies human newborn infant demonstrate 3 gene critical surfactant metabolism : surfactant protein B ( SFTPB ) , surfactant protein C ( SFTPC ) , ATP-binding cassette transporter , ABCA3 ( ABCA3 ) . To understand genetic regulatory mechanism , investigate contribution variation gene risk neonatal respiratory distress syndrome test hypothesis genetic variant SFTPB , SFTPC , ABCA3 disrupt pulmonary surfactant metabolism . Using high throughput automate sequence genotype , multidimensional protein identification technology assess quantitative qualitative difference surfactant protein B C expression , vivo metabolic label stable isotopically labeled precursor estimate surfactant protein B C phospholipid metabolic rate , cohort size provide statistical power ( 0.8 ) , use race-specific , severity-stratified case-control ( N=480 ) case comparison ( N=250 ) design understand genetically regulate , metabolic mechanism cause surfactant deficiency disrupt expression alter process surfactant protein B C disrupt surfactant phospholipid composition human newborn infant . Improved understanding genetic regulation surfactant deficiency suggest novel diagnostic strategy identify categorize high risk infant therapeutic strategy target discrete step pulmonary surfactant metabolism improve outcome infant neonatal respiratory distress syndrome .</detailed_description>
