	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Criteria diagnosis per WHO classification hematologic tumor ( Jaffe 2001 ) . As per 1996 NCI guideline CLL `` [ secondline later ] treatment CLL generally palliative intent ; therefore , patient relapse may follow without therapy experience diseaserelated symptom progressive disease , deterioration blood count , discomfort lymphadenopathy hepatosplenomegaly , recurrent infection , associate autoimmune disorder '' ( Cheson 1996 ) . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use highdose simvastatin patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Life expectancy great 6 month . ECOG performance status # 2 good . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : total bilirubin within normal institutional limit unless result documented hemolysis AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ 1.5 institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Creatine phosphokinase ≤ 1.5 institutional upper limit normal Patients active infection require systemic antibiotic exclude resolution infection The effect simvastatin develop human fetus study therapeutic dose unknown . For reason HMGCoA reductase inhibitor may teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain nervous system disease exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition simvastatin . Patients receive medication substance inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 ineligible . Lists include medication substance know potential interact CYP3A4 isoenzymes provide appendix . Patients may take anticholesterol treatment study . Patients previously take anticholesterol treatment prior study entry must anticholesterol medication 14 day enrol trial . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , diarrhea , myopathy , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study HMGCoA reductase inhibitor drug class potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother simvastatin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated simvastatin . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction simvastatin .</criteria>
