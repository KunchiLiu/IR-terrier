	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , vinorelbine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving sorafenib together vinorelbine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose sorafenib give together vinorelbine see well work treat woman stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Vinorelbine Treating Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine safety , tolerability , recommend phase II dose sorafenib tosylate administer combination vinorelbine ditartrate woman stage IV adenocarcinoma breast . ( Phase I ) - To evaluate 4-month progression-free survival rate patient treat regimen maximum tolerate dose . ( Phase II ) Secondary - To determine time treatment failure patient . - To determine response rate patient . - To determine overall survival progression-free survival patient . - To evaluate toxicity profile regimen . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study sorafenib tosylate follow phase II study . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate day 1-28 vinorelbine ditartrate IV day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
