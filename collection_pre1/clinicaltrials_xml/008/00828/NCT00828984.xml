	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well macrogol 3350-based oral osmotic laxative ( polyethylene glycol 3350 ) work prevent cancer patient risk colorectal cancer . Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming . The use macrogol 3350-based oral osmotic laxative may stop cancer grow patient risk colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Macrogol 3350-based Oral Osmotic Laxative Preventing Cancer Patients Risk Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 3350 ( administer 8 g 17 g/day six month ) versus placebo epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect PEG 3350 aberrant crypt focus ( ACF ) number compare reduction ACF number low dose ( 8 g PEG 3350/day ) high dose ( 17 g PEG 3350/day ) group . II . To determine effect PEG 3350 mucosal epithelial proliferation ( marker proliferation Ki-67 [ Ki-67 ] ) . III . To determine effect PEG 3350 mucosal apoptosis ( cleave caspase-3 ) . IV . To determine effect PEG 3350 snail family zinc finger 1 ( SNAIL ) protein expression . V. To determine effect PEG 3350 messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression SNAIL EGFR . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive high-dose macrogol 3350-based oral osmotic laxative orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . ARM B : Patients receive low-dose macrogol 3350-based oral osmotic laxative PO QD . ARM C : Patients receive placebo ( i.e. , maltodextrose powder ) PO QD . In arm , treatment begin within 6-10 day colonoscopy continue 6 month absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
