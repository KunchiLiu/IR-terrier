	<brief_title>PET-CT Management Patients With Stage III IV Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , PET-CT scan performed . The picture produce scan compare standard CT scan see additional tumor locate . If study doctor think additional tumor present , biopsy may need perform check status tumor . The type biopsy depend tumor ( ) locate body . If biopsy perform , sign separate consent . Screening Tests : Women decide take part study ask think might pregnant start study . Women unsure may pregnant think may pregnant must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . PET-CT Scan Procedure : Before PET-CT scan perform , ask avoid stressful exercise 24 hour . Starting 12 hour scan , eat high protein diet limit amount carbohydrates eat . Starting 6 hour scan , eat drink anything water ( fast ) scan do . You may continue take prescribed drug water fast period . On day PET-CT scan , wear comfortable clothing , preferably without metal button and/or zipper . You ask remove metallic object arrive PET-CT Center . - Blood ( drops fingertip ) collect check blood sugar level . - A radioactive sugar solution , call fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) , give needle vein arm . The injection last 5 minute . Following FDG injection , rest 1 hour allow FDG move throughout body . You ask urinate scan perform . You lie flat back scanner table . The table move slowly donut-shaped machine call PET-CT scanner . This scanner create picture show FDG tumor ( ) organs . The scan take 45-60 minute . You need lie still possible scan perform . Length Study : Your participation study PET-CT scan complete . Follow-Up Visits : As part standard care , primary care physician may order additional imaging completion study follow-up purpose . The study doctor review image compare PET-CT image . The study doctor also review result biopsy may result PET-CT finding . This investigational study . PET-CT CT scan FDA approve commercially available . The PET-CT component study investigational do within certain timeframe ( within 30 day CT scan ) instead timeframe doctor would normally decide . Up 150 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . AJCC Stage III melanoma clinically evident ( macroscopic ) disease , either physical examination conventional imaging , AJCC stage IV melanoma metastatic site ( ) consider surgically resectable . The initial decision regard surgical candidacy make surgical oncologist . Patients indeterminate CT finding large 1 cm outside field potential surgery also include . 2 . Contrast enhance CT chest , abdomen pelvis perform either MDACC outside institution indicate surgical candidacy . Outside CT image study acceptable quality , determine evaluate radiologist . PETCT per protocol must perform within 30 day contrastenhanced CT. 3 . 3 . Age &gt; /= 18 . All minor patient exclude avoid excessive radiation dose . There data suggest small statistically significant increase risk secondary malignancy due cumulative dose radiation exposure associate diagnostic imaging . Children sensitive radiation long term adverse effect . Therefore current pilot study accrue adult . If result study indicate potential advantage PETCT , data weight radiation exposure risk decide upon image strategy pediatric patient melanoma . 1 . Regional disease limit involved sentinel lymph node ( occult microscopic regional nodal metastasis ) . 2 . Availability prior PETCT , perform within 60 day initial clinical appointment .</criteria>
