	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Decitabine High Grade Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) group different kind stem cell abnormality . It characterize low blood count abnormal blood cell formation . These abnormal blood cell cause fatigue , shortness breath , infection , bleed . There significant risk develop acute leukemia disorder . The known curative therapy allogeneic bone marrow transplant vast majority patient disorder candidate . Currently three drug approve treatment MDS : azacytidine , decitabine lenalidomide low grade patient chromosome 5q abnormality . Azacytidine decitabine demonstrate improve blood count , improve quality life , decrease risk progression AML death sizable minority MDS patient . A recent study MDS patient respond clinically decitabine reveal bone marrow biopsy still show stromal abnormality increase angiogenesis . Lenalidomide act level stromal - marrow cell interaction . It hypothesize combination decitabine lenalidomide may show synergistic result .</detailed_description>
