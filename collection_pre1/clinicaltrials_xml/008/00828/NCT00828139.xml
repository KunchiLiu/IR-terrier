	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study topotecan see well work give without aflibercept treat patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Combinations biological substance aflibercept may able carry tumor-killing substance directly small cell lung cancer cell . Aflibercept may also stop growth small cell lung cancer block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether topotecan effective without aflibercept treat patient small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0802 - Topotecan With Without Aflibercept Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate efficacy topotecan hydrochloride v without aflibercept ( ziv-aflibercept ) , term progression-free survival 3 month , patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer previously treat platinum-based therapy . SECONDARY OBEJCTIVES : I. Assess response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) subset patient measurable disease . II . Assess overall survival patient . III . Evaluate frequency severity toxicity regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord response prior platinum-based therapy ( platinum-sensitive disease v platinum-refractory disease ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive ziv-aflibercept IV 1 hour day 1 topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients responsive stable disease 4 course may receive ziv-aflibercept IV day 1 topotecan hydrochloride IV day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients responsive stable disease 4 course may receive topotecan hydrochloride IV day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
