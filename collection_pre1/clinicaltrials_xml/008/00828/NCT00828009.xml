	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving vaccine therapy together bevacizumab chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give BLP25 liposome vaccine together bevacizumab chemotherapy radiation therapy treat patient newly diagnose stage IIIA stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BLP25 Liposome Vaccine Bevacizumab After Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage IIIA Stage IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine safety BLP25 liposome vaccine bevacizumab definitive chemoradiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy patient newly diagnose , unresectable stage IIIA IIIB nonsquamous cell non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - To evaluate overall survival progression-free patient treat regimen . - To evaluate toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Chemoradiotherapy : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 15-30 minute week 6 week . Patients also undergo concurrent definitive radiotherapy 5 day week 6½ week . Patients complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) proceed consolidation chemotherapy . - Consolidation chemotherapy : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 15-30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients CR , PR , SD proceed maintenance therapy . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive single dose cyclophosphamide IV 15-30 minute 3 day first dose bevacizumab BLP25 liposome vaccine . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 BLP25 liposome vaccine subcutaneously day 1 , 8 , 15 course 1 2 day 1 every course begin course 4 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 34 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
