	<brief_summary>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm pancreas ( IPMN ) increasingly recognize clinical practice . They represent unique clinicopathologic entity characterize mucin production , cystic dilation pancreatic duct , intraductal papillary growth . The World Health Organization recognize IPMN distinct clinical entity 1996 . Recent literature suggest 45 % IPMN malignant resect ; however data base large , primarily symptomatic lesion . Several study publish recent literature report single-center experience IPMN resection observation small number patient . The natural history lesion risk malignancy still vague . Consensus guideline management IPMN publish 2006 , note limited knowledge available six area : definition classification , preoperative evaluation , indication resection , method resection , histological data frozen section/positive margin specimen processing , finally , method follow-up . Speaking need , propose international registry multi-center collaboration area need IPMN research clinical management . This centralized , web-based registry data enter center de-identified way protect confidentiality . The data collect IRB approve retrospective chart review IRB # 07-007202 incorporate data base . Any patient participate prospective study consent HIPPA consent prior collection data .</brief_summary>
