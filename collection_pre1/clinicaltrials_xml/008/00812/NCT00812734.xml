	<brief_summary>This cohort study aim know prevalence 3 6 month surgery , persistent pain , well describe neuropathic feature pain . It include 3000 patient schedule different type surgery , already know induce persistent pain , frequent procedure additional data . Clinical genetical risk factor search .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiologic Multicentre Study Neuropathic Post-surgical Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuropathic post-surgical pain ( NPSP ) motivate consultation French Centres Evaluation Treatment Pain 20 35 % case . The follow table show available data literature chronic post-surgical pain : Surgery Prevalence chronic pain ( % ) Neuropathic symptom Mastectomy 22 49 Yes Inguinal hernia repair 30 63 Yes Sternotomy 28 40 Unknown Saphenectomy 5 7 Yes Mandibular osteotomy Unknown Yes Cholecystectomy 3 20 Unknown Caesarean section 6 Unknown Thoracotomy 50 75 Yes Knee arthroscopy Unknown Unknown Rectal amputation 12 18 Unknown Limb amputation 60 Yes Endodontic treatment 5 13 Unknown In case , mechanism pain highly suspected neuropathic , although location nerve ( ) concern unclear . However , clinical feature pain often poorly describe . In type surgery ( caesarean section cholecystectomy ) , report chronic pain may relate high frequency procedure . The initiation NPSP identify time scale ( i.e . day surgery ) , prospectively expect . This lead possibility ( ) well understanding evolution neuropathy follow time ( ii ) study putative preventive ( peritraumatic ) treatment . Thus , NPSP appear strongly different chronic pain syndrome ( diabetes mellitus , chemotherapy cancer even post-traumatic ) time course , mechanisms psychic interaction complex . We suspect overall prevalence NPSP may underestimate , ( ) delay onset pain may range day several month , ( ii ) always systematic follow-up surgical procedure , patient may stay medical network ( iii ) benefit provide surgical procedure may lead patient complain somewhat `` necessary '' complication . No large epidemiologic study perform concern neuropathic post-surgical pain date . The principal aim study know exact prevalence NPSP , 3 6 month date surgery . Only nine surgical procedure consider study , accord previous data literature and/or high frequency practice . This prospective open epidemiologic study , perform nine French university general hospital , three anti-cancer university hospital many general hospital . The secondary endpoint ( ) find relationship ( multivariate analysis ) NPSP large number clinical/biological item ( quality life , habit , treatment , drug abuse , psychic/mental state , genomeâ€¦ ) collect preoperatively , ( ii ) validate self-completed version questionnaire already validate discriminate neuropathic feature chronic pain ( DN4 ) , ( iii ) ass availability exist medical network care NPSP . Patients ( age &gt; 18 ) schedule one nine type surgery recruit . The number patient ( follow table ) recruit calculated basis report prevalence pain literature ( set 20 % data available ) , risk set 5 % , precision measure set 5 % prediction 20 % lose patient study . Type surgery Number request Caesarean section 103 Inguinal hernia repair ( laparoscopy ) 389 Inguinal hernia repair ( without mesh ) 389 Inguinal hernia repair ( mesh ) 389 Mastectomy ( simple without axillary node dissection ) 454 Cholecystectomy ( laparoscopy ) 297 Saphenectomy ( exclude harvest coronary bypass ) 167 Sternotomy 374 Thoracotomy 463 Knee arthroscopy 297 Total 3322 The anaesthetist charge patient pre-anaesthetic visit complete data sheet concern preoperative status patient . He proceed inclusion provide data concern anaesthetic analgesic protocol follow . The inclusion register local coordinating assistant , ( ) send patient self-questionnaires 3 6 month date surgery ( pain , neuropathic symptom result quality life ) ( ii ) transfer information national coordinating centre ( Centre Clinical Investigations Clermont-Ferrand ) . A permanent monitoring inclusion follow-up perform local national level . This help organise rhythm location inclusion time study . If case chronic pain identify , willing patient send close Centre Evaluation Treatment Pain , diagnosis complete treatment initiate require . For validation self-completed version DN4 questionnaire , data painless , painful neuropathic , painful non-neuropathic patient , compare .</detailed_description>
