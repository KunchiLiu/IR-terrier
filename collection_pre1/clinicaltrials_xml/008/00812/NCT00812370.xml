	<brief_summary>Thrombosis significant medical complication child chronic disease . The currently utilized treatment many drawback lead poor outcome . More modern therapy available systematically test child . This study determine whether one medication , bivalirudin safer effective alterative . This study monitor effect drug upon child 's body body process study drug ( absorption , metabolism elimination ) . The study also evaluate drug 's effectiveness follow long take dissolve clot . The safety issue monitor relate observation major minor bleeding episode take drug , and/or side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The UNBLOCK Study : Utilization Bivalirudin On Clots Kids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-arm , dose-finding , pharmacokinetic , safety efficacy study bivalirudin child 6 month 18 year age deep vein thrombosis . The specific aim follow : 1 . Pharmacodynamic analysis base activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) perform best bolus dose initial infusion dose bivalirudin determine 3 age cohort child . 2 . Pharmacokinetic analysis bivalirudin determine base bivalirudin plasma level 3 age cohort . 3 . Comparison pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics perform determine whether aPTT adequate surrogate plasma bivalirudin level . 4 . The rate clot resolution within 48-72 hour determine . 5 . The safety bivalirudin determine assess major minor bleed adverse event . A total 30 patient enrol study . They divide 3 group accord age range ( 6 months-age &gt; 5 , 5 &gt; 12 year 12 &gt; 18 year ) . The patient must deep vein thrombosis ( clot artery vein ) see image test . After receive study drug , subject blood test specific timepoints measure drug effect body drug act body . Based upon level blood test , dose study drug may adjust stop . The subject continue drug clot dissolve , subject prescribe different anticoagulant physician parent decide remove child study . The drug also discontinue excessive bleeding severe side effect relate drug observe . A follow imaging study perform patient 48-72 hour drug start . If clot still present time , another imaging study do 30 day drug give . The subject continue lab test twice weekly 3 week monitor effect drug . After completion study , patient undergo study exit physical exam 20-40 day drug stop .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children &gt; 6 month &lt; 18 year age . Deep vein thrombosis demonstrate objective testing ( Duplex ultrasonography , venography , CT venography , MR venography , echocardiography ) . This imaging must perform within 72 hour prior initiation study drug anticoagulation start . If receiving anticoagulation prior start study drug , image must perform within 24 hour study drug initiation . Informed consent assent parent/guardian/patient Treatment present thrombus thrombolytic agent . Treatment present thrombus another anticoagulant 48 hour ( low dose heparin maintenance venous arterial catheter patency allow ) . Baseline prothrombin time ( PT ) 3 second upper limit normal baseline activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) 5 second upper limit normal . Creatinine 20 % upper limit normal age . Presence known bleeding disorder . Active bleeding . Planned invasive procedure within 3 day . Known pregnancy</criteria>
