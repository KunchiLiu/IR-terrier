	<brief_summary>Autoregulation ability vascular bed maintain blood flow despite change perfusion pressure . For long time assume choroid strictly passive vascular bed , show autoregulation . However , recently several group identify autoregulatory capacity choroid . Choroidal autoregulation first show rabbit model intraocular pressure ( IOP ) arterial blood pressure could vary independently . In experiment regulation choroidal blood flow dependent ocular perfusion pressure , also dependent value IOP . This indicate myogenic mechanism contribute choroidal autoregulation , regulatory capacity dependent transmural pressure . In model myogenic autoregulation arteriole change vascular tone depend pressure inside vessel outside vessel . The present experiment design test whether myogenic mechanism may also involve choroidal autoregulation human . For purpose investigator perform experiment IOP arterial blood pressure increase . According myogenic theory autoregulation one would expect strong vasoconstriction lower IOPs increase ocular perfusion pressure .</brief_summary>
