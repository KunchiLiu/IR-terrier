	<brief_title>Integrating Insulin Delivery Glucose Sensing Subcutaneous Tissue Treatment Type-1 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment type 1 diabetes comprises measurement glucose capillary blood obtain fingersticking administration exogenous insulin form subcutaneous bolus injection subcutaneous infusion . This treatment could simplify stable ratio blood glucose concentration tissue glucose level site insulin delivery tissue glucose level could use estimate blood glucose level , thereby circumvent need fingerstick blood glucose monitoring . The aim study ascertain whether stable ratio blood glucose concentration glucose level tissue site insulin infusion exist tissue site expose variable insulin infusion rate . To achieve , microdialysis microperfusion probe apply healthy type 1 diabetic subject perform insulin delivery glucose sample adipose tissue site euglycemic clamps oral glucose tolerance test .</detailed_description>
