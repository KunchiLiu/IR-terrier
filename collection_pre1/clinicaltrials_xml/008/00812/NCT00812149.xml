	<brief_summary>This study intend examine common genetic pattern affect thyroid function . Recent study demonstrate substance ( enzyme ) produce gene important role control circulate thyroid hormone level . A commonly find pattern gene exist many individual might affect function enzyme . These individual need high dos thyroid hormone medication certain situation ( e.g . treatment thyroid cancer thyroid gland remove ) individual without variation . We intend study look response hormone-test healthy volunteer different genetic pattern . We plan screen healthy volunteer use blood test identify genetic pattern relate enzyme interested . From group , forty-five healthy volunteer recruit hormone-test . This test ( call TRH test ) use hormone produce brain stimulates pituitary thyroid gland . The response test allow u compare function thyroid system relation genetic pattern volunteer . We hypothesize stimulation thyroid hormone system decrease volunteer specific genetic pattern individual release less active thyroid hormone thyroid gland response TRH test . This study provide new information effect common genetic pattern thyroid hormone function help u good understand way thyroid hormone system operate . Ultimately , result study might help provide individualized therapy patient need thyroid hormone replacement .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects healthy male female adult volunteer , age 18 65 , able provide inform consent . Patients young 18 exclude purely physiologic study unable justify potential risk . However , preliminary finding show potential clinically relevant benefit child , protocol could modify include . Patients older 65 exclude due intrinsic difference thyroid hormone dynamic , compare young subject , could confound study interpretation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 .
