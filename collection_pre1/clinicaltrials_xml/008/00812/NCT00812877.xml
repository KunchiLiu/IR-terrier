	<brief_title>Pulp Capping With Two Different Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study test two dental product use direct pulp cap agent permanent teeth . The two product mineral trioxide aggregate calcium hydroxide . A direct pulp cap consists cover expose tooth pulp ( inside portion tooth blood vessel nerve supply tooth ) medication maintain tooth vitality . Different event cause pulp expose , example deep cavity , accident outer portion tooth fracture . When occurs , sometimes possible place medicine top exposure ( `` cap '' ) effort allow pulp heal . Our study intend compare two medicine , calcium hydroxide mineral trioxide aggregate , Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve product , determine one perform well . The study conduct patient recruit Northwest PRECEDENT practitioner . The practitioner interested participate study randomize ( assigned chance ) one two intervention group : treatment group ( mineral trioxide aggregate ) control group ( calcium hydroxide ) . Direct pulp cap complete permanent ( adult ) teeth pulp expose due decay , trauma ( injury ) mechanical exposure . Treated teeth follow two year determine well responded treatment . All patient pulp exposure permanent tooth eligible study . These patient ask participate study satisfy inclusion criterion study present exclusion criterion state study protocol . A tooth receive pulp cap treat follow manner : After tooth pulp expose tooth find suitable pulp cap , exposure surround area clean gentle rinsing water . A cotton pellet moisten 5.25 % sodium hypochlorite place exposure allow sit 1-2 minute . This procedure use control pulp bleed remove germ area . After initial period , cotton pellet remove area inspect . If bleed continue , new cotton pellet moisten sodium hypochlorite solution reapplied area additional several minute . This repeat bleeding control practitioner decide pulp cap appropriate situation . Once bleed control exposure , one two pulp cap agent apply pulp exposure site . Practices assign chance one two treatment group , complete direct pulp cap mineral trioxide aggregate complete direct pulp cap calcium hydroxide , FDA approve agent purpose . The handle characteristic two material different , practical blind practitioner material use . Likewise , training use material require . It believe important practitioner become familiar competent use one material ensure use appropriately , practitioner use material confuse procedure . Since time critical element success failure direct pulp capping , patient consent participate study procedure do . A resin-modified glass ionomer liner ( e.g . Vitrebond , Fuji Lining Cement , Fuji II LC , Vitremer ) place pulp cap agent . This liner seal pulp cap agent protect pulp infiltrate bacteria . After resin-modified glass ionomer line material set , final filling place . Two type instrument use study : Study participant data collection form This form collect two type data : demographic clinical data . The demographic part gather information regard patient age , gender , race . The clinical form collect data regard clinical x-ray evaluation tooth treat direct pulp cap : condition tooth , type pulp exposure ( decay , injury tooth preparation ) , patient ' complaint regard tooth , result diagnostic test ( x-ray , pain biting temperature , etc ) record . Practitioner feedback survey A survey administer practitioner participate study . This survey include series question design evaluate communication member practitioner network , practitioner/staff training , patient recruitment , obtain informed consent , data collection data transmission , include electronic data capture system . The survey also try determine well office able combine research regular daily office schedule order determine research project would affect normal day-to-day routine . The intent study find two product yield well result pulp cap agent . In order detect , failure rate two treatment group compare use statistical test . Distributions covariates two treatment group compare clinical judgment use identify covariates serious group imbalance would cause unusual result primary analysis . Logistic regression use compare failure rate adjust covariates imbalanced group .</detailed_description>
