	<detailed_description>This pilot study design show difference efficacy , safety cost two regimen . Its main purpose provide information , calcineurin free immunosuppressive treatment valuable alternative treatment de novo kidney transplant recipient . Furthermore , investigate side effect arm possible decide , absence calcineurin inhibition lack nephrotoxicity outweigh adverse effect Rapamycin . With obtained information possible plan large trial , warrant compare mention treatment regimens detail .</detailed_description>
