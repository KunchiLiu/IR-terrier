	<criteria>All Subjects : Male female , age 1865 year , inclusive , Screening . Eligible female subject childbearing potential nonsterilized male sexual partner must agree use hormonal contraceptive , barrier contraceptive additional spermicide , intrauterine device begin &gt; 30 day prior study drug administration continue &gt; 7 day end study . Female subject postmenopausal must postmenopausal &gt; 1 year wish use contraceptive . If postmenopausal status questionable , subject 's follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level must check must elevate consistent postmenopausal level ( i.e. , &gt; 40 IU/L ) ; otherwise subject must agree use contraceptive list . Able willing comply study visit procedure , include return schedule posttreatment visit . Able speak , read , understand language inform consent , instrument use collect subjectreported outcome , order enable accurate appropriate response study assessment . Willing capable provide write informed consent . Subjects Hepatic Impairment : Subjects must positive diagnosis liver cirrhosis ( hepatic fibrosis evidence either micro macronodular regeneration ) stable two month confirm image technique , biopsy , physical sign consistent clinical diagnosis liver cirrhosis ( e.g. , liver firmness palpation , splenic enlargement , spider angioma , palmar erythema , parotid hypertrophy , testicular atrophy , gynecomastia ) . Subjects must impair stable hepatic function evidence ChildPugh Clinical Assessment Score 7 9 screening baseline . Control Subjects Normal Hepatic Function : Subjects must general good health determine past medical history , physical examination , vital sign , electrocardiogram , Chest XRay ( CXR ) , laboratory test screen . Subjects match hepatically impaired subject gender , age ( ±15 % ) weight ( ±20 % ) . All Subjects A history hypersensitivity amide type local anesthetic . Pregnancy , nursing , plan become pregnant course study . Body weight less 60 kg ( ~132 lbs ) 120 kg ( ~264 lbs ) . BMI less 18 35 kg/m2 Significant acute , new onset illness ( e.g. , flu , gastroenteritis ) within two week prior study treatment administration . Clinically significant haematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , neurological , psychiatric disease may pose significant safety risk diminish subject 's ability undergo study procedures assessment History immunocompromised status , include positive HIV ( ELISA Western blot ) test result . Evidence active alcohol drug abuse indicate test conduct screen baseline evaluation ; subject must state willing remain alcohol drug free three week study drug administration . Use ASA within 10 day prior study drug administration . Use Lidocaine , mepivacaine , etidocaine , ropivacaine , amidetype anesthetic form within 5 elimination halflives . Use local anesthetic within 3 day prior study drug administration . Administration investigational drug within 30 day 5 elimination halflives investigational drug , whichever longer , prior study drug administration , plan administration another investigational product procedure subject 's participation study . Any condition , opinion Investigator , render subject unsuitable participation study . NOTE : A specific rationale must provide documented exclude prospective subject deem unsuitable study . Subjects Hepatic Impairment : Clinically significant abnormal finding hepatic impairment . Clinical evidence severe ascites , judge investigator . History surgical portosystemic shunt . Fluctuating rapidly deteriorate hepatic function indicate recent history widely vary worsen clinical and/or laboratory sign hepatic impairment within screen period . On active Hepatitis treatment Interferon exclude medication ( see Appendix 4 ) Control Subjects Normal Hepatic Function : Prohibited prescription medication within 14 day prior dose ; see Appendix 4 specific medication . History presence liver disease liver injury indicate abnormal liver function profile SGOT , SGPT , GGT , alkaline phosphatase , serum bilirubin . Hepatitis B indicate positive HBs Ag , Hepatitis C indicate positive antiHCV result .</criteria>
