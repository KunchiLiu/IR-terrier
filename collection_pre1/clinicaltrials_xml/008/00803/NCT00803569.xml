	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make gene-modified virus may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect vaccine therapy treating patient stage II , stage III , stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cavity cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety tolerability ALVAC ( 2 ) -NY-ESO-1 ( M ) /TRICOM vaccine patient stage II-IV ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cavity cancer . Secondary - Determine tumor response patient treat regimen . - Determine immune response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive ALVAC ( 2 ) -NY-ESO-1 ( M ) /TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) SC day 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
