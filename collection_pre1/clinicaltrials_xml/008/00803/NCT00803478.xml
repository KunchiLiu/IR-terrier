	<brief_summary>Corneal sensation know play role tear secretion . Decreased sensation lead decrease tear production ; bilateral , lead decrease blink rate well . Dry eye common side effect LASIK . Incidence rate vary widely , report many 59 % patient . And almost patient transient dry eye symptom immediately follow LASIK . Previous study look effect hinge position ( superior vs. nasal ) hinge width corneal sensation dry eye LASIK perform mechanical microkeratome . Corneal sensation decrease dry eye sign symptom increase immediately follow LASIK eye . These parameter improve time period 1 week 6 month post-operative . Loss corneal sensation dry eye sign symptoms great eye superior-hinge flap nasal-hinge flap , eye narrower hinge flap rather wide hinge flap IntraLase LASIK , use IntraLase femtosecond laser rather mechanical microkeratome cut corneal flap , become increasingly popular procedure . It provide several advantage mechanical microkeratomes , include reduced surgical complication , predictable flap thickness , well astigmatic neutrality , decrease epithelial injury , ability operate wider range patient . The investigator propose study evaluate effect flap hinge size flap thickness corneal flap create IntraLase laser . The investigator would like determine difference previously discuss result find use mechanical microkeratome .

	<brief_title>The Effect Hinge Position Hinge Width Corneal Sensation Dry Eye After IntraLase LASIK Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corneal innervation/sensation supply long ciliary nerve branch trigeminal nerve . The nerve enter cornea mid-stroma nasal temporal limbus . They branch turn anterior form dense plexus sub-Bowman 's layer . The nerve finally terminate wing cell layer enervate epithelium . Corneal sensation show decreased corneal surgery , include LASIK . Corneal sensation know play role tear secretion . Decreased sensation lead decrease tear production ; bilateral , lead decrease blink rate well . Dry eye common side effect LASIK . Incidence rate vary widely , report many 59 % patient . And almost patient transient dry eye symptom immediately follow LASIK . Previous study look effect hinge position ( superior vs. nasal ) hinge width corneal sensation dry eye LASIK perform mechanical microkeratome.1,2 Corneal sensation decrease dry eye sign symptom increase immediately follow LASIK eye . These parameter improve time period 1 week 6 month post-operative . Loss corneal sensation dry eye sign symptoms great eye superior-hinge flap nasal-hinge flap , eye narrower hinge flap rather wide hinge flap IntraLase LASIK , use IntraLase femtosecond laser rather mechanical microkeratome cut corneal flap , become increasingly popular procedure . It provide several advantage mechanical microkeratomes , include reduced surgical complication , predictable flap thickness , well astigmatic neutrality , decrease epithelial injury,3 ability operate wider range patient . We propose study evaluate effect flap hinge position size corneal flap create IntraLase laser . We would like determine difference previously discuss result find use mechanical microkeratome . Also , increase ease program alternate hinge position width IntraLase , find significant difference alternate flap configuration , might translate feasible change clinical practice . Specific Aims : To evaluate effect hinge position ( superior vs. temporal ) , hinge width ( 45 vs. 90 degree ) , flap thickness corneal sensation dry eye IntraLase LASIK .</detailed_description>
