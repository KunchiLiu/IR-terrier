	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis Growth Hormone ( GH ) target peripheral tissue stimulate weight muscle growth maximize nutritional potential improve overall quality life . We theorize occur multitude factor : increase appetite , constructive utilization caloric intake decrease catabolic signaling . The first aim address change weight lean body mass follow institution GH therapy adult Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) relate waste . The second aim measure impact quality life individual . Additionally , third aim monitor effect GH therapy diabetes insulin sensitivity . Finally , fourth aim observe change subject underlying diagnosis CF , specifically lung function , muscle strength inflammatory state .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The follow detailed description aim list : Specific Aim 1 : Measure change weight adult CF relate waste follow GH therapy . 1.1 ) Monitor weight gain loss baseline . 1.2 ) Assess change fat free mass baseline bioelectrical impedence analysis . Specific Aim 2 : Evaluate overall quality life ( QOL ) adult CF relate waste treat GH therapy . 2.1 ) Perform CF disease-specific general QOL analysis via CF QOL questionnaires . 2.2 ) Monitor compliance therapy via subject report . Specific Aim 3 : Monitor impact GH therapy relation CF relate diabetes onset control . 3.1 ) Measure impact insulin sensitivity non-diabetes subject 3.2 ) Observe change exogenous insulin requirement glycemic control subject diabetes . Specific Aim 4 : Quantify impact anabolic therapy manifestation underlie diagnosis associate CF . 4.1 ) Observe change lung function baseline GH therapy . 4.2 ) Determine change overall muscle strength via hand grip six minute walk . 4.3 ) Evaluate change serum marker .</detailed_description>
