	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study side effect paclitaxel give together cisplatin topotecan without bevacizumab compare well work treat patient stage IVB , cervical cancer come back persistent . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , cisplatin , topotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . It yet know whether paclitaxel effective give together cisplatin topotecan without bevacizumab treat patient cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Cisplatin Topotecan With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage IVB , Recurrent , Persistent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition bevacizumab chemotherapy improve overall survival . Also determine regimen involve paclitaxel topotecan improves overall survival comparison regimen involve cisplatin paclitaxel . These regimen evaluate patient stage IVB , recurrent , persistent carcinoma cervix . II . To determine compare frequency severity adverse event assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 3.0 regimen administer study . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate compare progression-free survival patient treat regimen investigate study . II . To estimate compare proportion patient tumor response regimen investigate study . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition bevacizumab chemotherapy , substitution cisplatin topotecan improve health relate quality life ( QOL ) measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Cervix Trial Outcome Index scale ( FACT-Cx TOI ) produce favorable toxicity profile ( particular focus peripheral neuropathy measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity version 4 [ FACT/GOG-Ntx4 ] subscale pain measure Brief Pain Inventory [ BPI ] single item ) . II . To evaluate impact age , race , performance status , stage , histology , grade , disease site , prior chemotherapy primary radiation , time recurrence response rate , progression-free survival overall survival patient metastatic/recurrent/persistent carcinoma cervix . III . To determine prevalence active smoking cohort recurrent cervical cancer patient . IV . To estimate extent tobacco/nicotine dependence cohort . V. To determine smoking independent risk factor progression-free survival overall survival population . VI . To isolate , enumerate characterize circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) recover blood drawn pre-cycle 1 , pre-cycle 2 pre-cycle 3 use CTC-chip develop Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) BioMEMS Resource Center MGH Cancer Center . VII . To determine association CTC count characteristic measure clinical outcome . VIII . To examine association angiogenesis marker plasma ( recover blood draw pre-cycle 1 , pre-cycle 2 pre-cycle 3 ) measure clinical outcome . IX . To evaluate association tumor marker angiogenesis hypoxia ( use archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue ) measure clinical outcome . X . To evaluate association single nucleotide polymorphism ( use deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] extract whole blood ) measure clinical outcome well measure quality life chemotherapy toxicity . XI . To examine relationship ( ) among various biomarkers . XII . To develop optimal prognostic model progression-free survival overall survival use clinical covariates , smoke status various biomarkers . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour 24 hour day 1 cisplatin IV day 1 2 . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour 24 hour day 1 cisplatin IV bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 2 . ARM III : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-3 . ARM IV : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-3 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
