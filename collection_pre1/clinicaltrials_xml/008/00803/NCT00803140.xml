	<brief_summary>Cutaneous scar elective surgery concern surgeon type , perhaps even plastic surgeon . Cautery often use `` cut '' set make extend incision ; however study look result scar . The investigator ' study aim compare standard scalpel incision versus cautery incision objectively compare resultant scar prospective , randomize , control fashion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cutaneous Scarring Scalpel Versus Cautery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Most surgeon point use `` cut '' set cautery device make extend incision . Anecdotally , appear noticeable difference scarring . This opinion , however share surgeon . Review literature reveals paucity evidence support use cut cautery vs. standard , scalpel incision . A study objectively , prospectively , randomly compare scar two method potential alter doctrine scalpel incision , potentially save money , allow safe operating room environment ( one free scalpel case ) . Objectives : To objectively compare cutaneous scar result scalpel versus cut cautery incision use subjective objective scar measurement tool . Methodology : Research Design : This study Blinded , Prospective , Randomized Controlled Trial . Research Participants : Comparison Information : The patient ½ incision perform standard scalpel incision , contralateral ½ incision cut cautery incision . The side randomize use random number generator . For purpose study , right side incision define patient 's right side leave side incision define patient 's left side . Criteria Discontinuation : The study discontinue becomes obvious cautery ½ incision develop increase complication relate infection , wind breakdown , scar . Observations : The patient follow surgery evaluation 2 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month . Patients , physician blind independent observer evaluate scar use visual analogue scale 2 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month . Also , 12 month , Patient Observer Scar Assessment Tool use evaluate scar order provide objective subjective scar evaluation . The subject , surgeon blind observer complete evaluation . Sample Size : 10 patient enrol study . The data gather pilot study provide u data necessary perform power sample size calculation future randomize control trial . Date Management Analysis : At postoperative follow visit ( 2 week +/- 4 day , 3 month +/- 2 week , 6 month +/- 2 week ) , patient , physician independent observer evaluate scar subjectively use visual analogue scale measure 10 cm length . One side scale ( side nearest 0 ) imply poor scar imaginable ; opposite side represent best . Measurements take regard width , observation regard erythema pigment note . At 12 month postoperative follow , Patient Observer Scar Assessment Tool use compare scar order provide subjective objective data . Ethical Considerations Protection Human Subjects : Approval IRB obtain prior begin study . All investigator meet federal institutional educational requirement Human Subjects Protection . Patients offer scar revision additional cost patient `` test '' side . These scar revision offer 1 year necessary .</detailed_description>
