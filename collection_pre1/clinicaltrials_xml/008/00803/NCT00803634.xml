	<brief_title>Clevidipine Treatment Blood Pressure Patients With Acute Heart Failure ( PRONTO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label randomize efficacy safety pilot trial patient acute heart failure ( AHF ) hypertension ( systolic blood pressure [ SBP ] ≥160 mm Hg ) require parenteral antihypertensive therapy . Eligible patient randomize receive clevidipine standard care ( SOC ) intravenous antihypertensive treatment open-label manner ratio 1:1 . At time randomization , patient-specific , prespecified SBP target range determine record , prior study drug treatment . Information dose regimen , use additional alternative agent transition oral therapy need detailed study 'ARM ' 'INTERVENTION ' section . A Data Safety Monitoring Board utilize periodically throughout study monitor safety patient . Adverse event assess 7 day post-study randomization hospital discharge , whichever occur first . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) assess 30 day follow study randomization . Subjects contact telephone person 5 day 30-day time point determine SAEs occur follow study drug treatment follow Heath Economic assessment .</detailed_description>
