	<brief_summary>FC-6 Phase II , multi-center clinical trial patient unresectable , wild-type K-RAS , colorectal cancer metastasis confine liver . Liver metastases must determine FC-6 criterion unresectable , colorectal cancer ( CRC ) tumor ( primary metastatic ) must find wild-type K-RAS . Patients mutant K-RAS tumor ineligible . K-RAS test do local hospital tumor sample submit FC-6 central lab ( Esoterix Clinical Trial Services ) . A primary aim study evaluate surgical conversion rate use cytotoxic combination chemotherapy biologic therapy cetuximab , monoclonal antibody target epidermal growth factor receptor . A second primary aim evaluate safety tolerability chemotherapy/targeted therapy regimen patient population . Secondary aim include determination clinical response rate , recurrence-free survival patient undergo complete resection and/or ablation liver metastasis , overall survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study With Neoadjuvant mFOLFOX7 Plus Cetuximab Determine Surgical Conversion Rate Unresectable Colorectal Cancer With Metastases Confined Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient receive FC-6 study treatment regimen every 2 week 8-week cycle total 3 cycle . Baseline image chest , abdomen , pelvis perform . CT scan MRI abdomen perform 1 cycle neoadjuvant therapy assess clinical response resectability liver metastasis . If liver metastasis deem resectable assessment , tumor assessment demonstrate stable disease partial response , therapy continue re-assessment clinical response resectability Cycle 2 , necessary , Cycle 3 . After minimum 1 cycle therapy , patient meet guideline resection liver metastases undergo liver metastasectomy ( tumor resection and/or ablation ) soon judge technically feasible hepatic surgeon order minimize chemotherapy damage liver morbidity surgery . At investigator 's discretion , chemotherapy cetuximab regimen may continue 1 additional treatment give least 2 week plan date surgery . This additional treatment , give , consider part 3 study therapy cycle . The surgical goal perform curative ( R0 ) resection and/or ablation . If curative surgery perform 1 2 cycle therapy administer surgery , postoperative therapy use regimen resume 4-6 week follow surgery complete 3 cycle study treatment . Following discontinuation study therapy , patient undergo R0 resection ( without ablation ) follow every 3 month first 2 year study every 6 month year 3 5 . Further therapy patient undergo R0 resection/ablation investigator 's discretion . These patient follow vital status every 12 month remainder 5-year period follow study entry . A total sample size 60 patient enrol FC-6 trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Conditions patient eligibility Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 must consider potential candidate major hepatic surgical procedure . The patient must histologic cytologic confirmation diagnosis colorectal adenocarcinoma . There must documentation PET/CT scan , CT scan , MRI , intraoperative palpation ( time resection primary colorectal tumor , applicable ) patient evidence hepatic metastasis . ( Histologic confirmation hepatic metastasis require . ) Patients eligible following : primary tumor regional node resect clear surgical margin evidence extrahepatic disease ; unresected primary tumor plan resect primary tumor prior study entry ; unresected primary tumor plan resect primary tumor liver metastases single surgical procedure perform within 27 week last preoperative dose chemotherapy/cetuximab ; unresected primary plan resect primary tumor liver metastasis stag procedure perform within 27 week last preoperative dose chemotherapy/cetuximab . The colorectal primary tumor metastatic tumor must determine wildtype KRAS . The KRAS test may perform local hospital , tumor sample may submit FC6 central lab KRAS testing . If local KRAS test result report indeterminate , submission tumor sample central testing require . Note : Needle biopsy liver metastasis recommend express purpose obtain tissue KRAS test risk needle track dissemination malignant cell . There must documentation liver metastasis must determine hepatic surgeon approve ( protocol define criterion ) participate FC6 unresectable base least one follow criterion : All liver metastasis resect ( and/or ablate ) negative margin , i.e. , lesion ( ) locate area would result resection hepatic vein main portal vein right leave hepatic artery common bile duct ; Complete resection and/or ablation would require great 60 % liver parenchyma remove . Note : At discretion hepatic surgeon , portal vein embolization ( PVE ) may utilize preoperatively follow neoadjuvant therapy enhance volume hepatic remnant . However , determination unresectability base estimate , time study entry , percentage liver parenchyma would need remove . PVE may employ preoperatively enhance overall safety , specifically resectability liver metastasis ( e ) . There must documentation : least 3 8 hepatic segment free metastasis ; base imaging study , patient anticipate least 40 % liver remain intact surgery . If adjuvant therapy regimen 5FU give alone combination leucovorin , irinotecan , capecitabine , oxaliplatin , cetuximab , bevacizumab administer , adjuvant therapy must discontinue 6 month prior study entry . The patient must follow test exams within 4 week prior study entry : medical history physical exam ; consultation hepatic surgeon approve FC6 ; PET/CT scan PET scan CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis must perform . ( MRI scan substitute CT scan . ) There must evidence adequate bone marrow function : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1500/mm3 ; Hemoglobin great equal 10 g/dL ; Platelets great equal 100,000/mm3 There must evidence adequate hepatic function : Total bilirubin less equal upper limit normal ( ULN ) lab ; aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 5.0 x ULN lab Serum creatinine must less equal 1.5 mg/dL . Conditions patient ineligibility Diagnosis anal small bowel carcinoma . Colorectal cancer adenocarcinoma , e.g. , sarcoma , lymphoma , carcinoid . Unresected primary tumor colon rectum significant symptom relate obstruction require radiation therapy . Evidence extrahepatic metastasis noncontiguous extension intrahepatic metastasis nonhepatic tissue . Radiographic evidence metastasis portal lymph node ( node great 1 cm diameter ) unless node ( ) proven biopsy negative . Previous hepatic resection and/or ablation , hepatic arterial infusion therapy , systemic therapy metastatic disease . ( Patients excisional biopsy eligible . ) Radiation therapy liver . Preexisting chronic hepatic disease ( e.g. , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis ) , opinion investigator hepatic surgeon , would limit patient 's ability undergo hepatic metastasectomy . Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) v3.0 grade 3 4 anorexia nausea relate metastatic disease . CTCAE v3.0 great equal grade 2 vomiting relate metastatic disease . CTCAE v3.0 great equal grade 2 sensory/motor neuropathy . Any following cardiac condition : Documented congestive heart failure ; Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry ; Unstable angina within 6 month prior study entry ; Symptomatic arrhythmia . Serious nonhealing wound , skin ulcer , bone fracture . History bleed diathesis coagulopathy . ( Patients stable anticoagulant therapy eligible . ) Symptomatic interstitial lung disease definitive evidence interstitial lung disease describe CT scan , MRI , chest xray asymptomatic patient . Any evidence active infection . Active inflammatory bowel disease . Other malignancy unless patient consider diseasefree complete therapy malignancy great equal 12 month prior study entry . Patients follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 12 month : carcinoma situ cervix , colorectal carcinoma situ , melanoma situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Previous serious hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement . Pregnancy lactation time study entry . ( WOCBP must negative pregnancy test within 2 week prior study entry . Male female patient reproductive potential must agree use adequate contraceptive method 2 month study therapy . ) Any serious concomitant medical condition , opinion investigator , would compromise safety patient compromise patient 's ability participate study . Use investigational product within 30 day prior study entry .</criteria>
