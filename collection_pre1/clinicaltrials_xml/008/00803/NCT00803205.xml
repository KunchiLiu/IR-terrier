	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) genetic disorder cause mutation gene make cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) protein . A specific type mutation call nonsense ( premature stop codon ) mutation cause CF approximately 10 % subject disease . Ataluren ( PTC124 ) orally deliver investigational drug potential overcome effect nonsense mutation . This study Phase 3 trial evaluate clinical benefit ataluren ( PTC124 ) adult pediatric patient CF due nonsense mutation . The main goal study understand whether ataluren ( PTC124 ) improve pulmonary function whether drug safely give long period time . The study also assess effect ataluren CF pulmonary exacerbation frequency , cough frequency , health-related quality life , antibiotic use CF-related infection , CF-related disruption daily live , body weight , CF pathophysiology .

	<brief_title>Study Ataluren ( PTC124™ ) Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase 3 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , efficacy safety study , design document clinical benefit ataluren ( PTC124 ) administer therapy patient CF due nonsense mutation ( premature stop codon ) CFTR gene . It plan ~208 subject ≥6 year age FEV1 ≥40 % ≤90 % predict enrol . Study subject enrol site North America , Europe , Israel . They randomize 1:1 ratio either ataluren ( PTC124 ) placebo . Subjects receive study drug 3 time per day ( morning , midday , even ) 48 week . Subjects evaluate clinic visit every 8 week . Additional safety laboratory test , may perform investigational site accredit local laboratory clinic , require every 4 week first 6 month study participation . At completion blind treatment , compliant participant eligible receive open-label ataluren ( PTC124 ) separate extension study .</detailed_description>
