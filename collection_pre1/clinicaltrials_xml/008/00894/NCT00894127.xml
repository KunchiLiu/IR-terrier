	<detailed_description>Meso Tetra ( 4-Carboxyphenyl ) Porphine ( TCPP ) porphyrin label cancer cell react increased number low-density lipoprotein coat surface cancer cell porous nature cancer cell membrane , cause cell fluoresce specific wavelength light . The primary objective clinical trial determine clinical sensitivity specificity CyPath® Lung Cancer Detection Assay ( `` CyPath® Assay '' ) use sputum specimen two cohort Participants . The Study design include protocol ass capability Biomoda CyPath® Lung Cancer Detection Assay detect cancer comparison routine high-resolution , low-dose Computed Tomography ( LDCT ) scan . Optimization Assay lead improve sensitivity specificity . Increase sample size evaluation entire sputum sample increase data collection differentiation cohort . Technicians current Study examine 12 slide contain approximately 600,000 cell . The average sputum sample pellet translate potential approximately 3.5 million cell evaluation . Evaluating full sputum sample CyPath® Assay accomplish flow cytometry would increase capture analysis exfoliate cancer cell sample . In-house study evaluate sample five different cancer cell line use flow cytometry . Preliminary result show cancer cell line detect significant fluorescence apart normal cell fluorescence . Refinements use flow cytometer include optimize liquid-based assay sample analysis focus concentration , incubation time optimal sample volume .</detailed_description>
