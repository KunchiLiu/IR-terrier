	<brief_title>The Burden Genetic Variability Extended-Spectrum ß-Lactamase ( ESBL ) - Producing Pathogens Swiss Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background &amp; Rationale : Increasing resistance antibiotic grow problem public health associate treatment failure , increase health care cost , prolong hospital stay . Over past year , one mechanism resistance particular concern : ESBL , produce mainly Escherichia coli Klebsiella specie also find gram negative bacteria . ESBLs plasmid-encoded ß-lactamases confer resistance penicillin , cephalosporin aztreonam . ESBL-producing enterobacteria usually susceptible carbapenems , ertapenem , imipenem meropenem . Thus , treatment carbapenems remain safe presence ESBL recognize . However , confirmation ESBL always routine procedure laboratory . Furthermore , ESBL strain high resistance ertapenem decrease activity imipenem meropenem already describe . The mechanism among strain however , appear combination expression ESBL impermeability increase efflux carbapenems . Infection ESBL-producing E. coli K. pneumoniae potentially hazardous patient . Mortality significantly high follow bloodstream infection cause ESBL produce E. coli compare non-ESBL produce strain . ESBLs encode plasmid : classically , plasmid mediate enzyme TEM SHV type . However , recent year CTX-M-type ESBLs increasingly identify worldwide throughout world . CTX-M enzyme predominantly hydrolyze cefotaxime , weakly active ceftazidime . However , ESBLs CTX-M family also display increase hydrolytic activity ceftazidime , case CTXM-15 CTX-M-32 . The prevalence ESBL produce enterobacteria particularly E. coli significantly increase recent year . This increase primarily due spread ESBL CTX-M-type . Genes encode CTX-M enzyme associate mobile genetic element allow enzyme spread throughout community . Well establish primer set use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test detection blaTEM , blaSHV , blaCTX-M gene , use differentiate ESBL strain . ESBL-producing organism first detect Europe 1980s . Although initial report come Germany , vast majority description first decade come France . Consequently , surprise first large outbreak occur France 1986 . Other outbreaks ESBL-producing organism report almost every European country . In southern Europe , prevalence ESBL hospital estimate around 25 % Klebsiella specie , community 1.7 % E. coli , 4 % K. pneumoniae . In USA , ESBL-producing organism first report 1988 . Similarly Europe , strain expand follow year , 2002 , 6.1 % K. pneumoniae isolate find resistant third-generation cephalosporin . Furthermore , least one tenth intensive care unit , ESBL produce K. pneumoniae quickly exceed 25 % isolated strain . In contrast , regular inpatient area prevalence rate remain around 5.7 % isolated K. pneumoniae . ESBL strain also document South Africa , Israel , Saudi Arabia , variety North African country . In South America , SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program recover ESBL 10 % E. coli 55 % K. pneumoniae . National survey Asia reveal presence ESBL-producers 5 8 % E. coli Korea , Japan , Malaysia , Singapore 12 24 % Thailand , Taiwan , Philippines , Indonesia . The prevalence China range 27 % 34 % E. coli 38.3 % K. pneumoniae already 2002 . This worldwide distribution reflect fact ESBL produce enterobacteria present community , adult well child 's hospital . However , young population , ESBL-producing strain isolate exclusively essentially neonatology , various outbreak describe . Studies neonates India reveal ESBL-strains half infant early-onset sepsis , 82 % late-onset sepsis . A study blood sample suspect case neonatal sepsis detect ESBL 87 % Klebsiella spp. , 73 % Enterobacter spp . 64 % E. coli strain . If consider resistance 3rd generation cephalosporin indicator ESBL , prevalence ESBL produce E.coli Klebsiella pneumoniae among child Switzerland estimate 2.2 % 4.3 % 2006 , respectively ( www.search.ifik.unibe.ch ) . The frequency ESBL produce enterobacteria Geneva year 1.8 % E. coli 4.9 % Klebsiella spp . ( personal communication Dr. P. Rohner ) . In Department Paediatrics Geneva , majority ESBL producer find among child `` Terre de Hommes '' , non-profit humanitarian organization , bring African child Switzerland cardiac surgery . These child history multiple hospital stay country origin , possibly repeat antimicrobial therapy . However , ESBL strain expect urinary tract infection national basis . The new recommendation entire oral treatment 3rd generation cephalosporin without initial intravenous application uncomplicated febrile urinary tract infection child effective 2008 . Therefore , child treat fully outpatient basis paediatricians general practitioner . Treatment might increase simplify therapeutic procedure general practitioner might switch trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole 3rd generation cephalosporin . Risk factor ESBL colonization infection well define similar resistant microorganism methicillin-resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) : serious illness prolong hospital stay , invasive medical device ( urinary catheter , endotracheal tube , central venous line ) , repeat prolonged antibiotic use , especially 3rd generation cephalosporin . Selective antibiotic pressure clearly associate emergence dissemination ESBL-producing enterobacteria . Children bloodstream infection due ESBL produce K. pneumoniae almost 6 time likely prior exposure extended-spectrum cephalosporin 30 day infection . Enterobacteria transfer direct contact fomites . Various outbreak describe incriminating source patient , artificial fingernail ultrasonography gel . The identification ESBL-producing bacteria prompt use isolation contact precaution measure . The application measure together antibiotic stewardship successful overcome outbreak ESBL-producing enterobacteria . However , success infection control measure depend largely recognition risk carrier state . Therefore , infected child track colonized patient well , capable transmit ESBL-producing bacteria vector health-care worker , directly patient . Finally , additional cost use resource important ESBL infection expensive . Average infection-related cost per patient significantly great ESBL patient control patient without ESBL . Additional cost attribute infection ESBL producer estimate 16'450 $ per patient hospital stay . This cost increase mainly due increase length stay . The prospective surveillance ESBL-producing enterobacteria Switzerland essential ESBL-producing enterobacteria represent already threat patient . This include delayed treatment therefore cure , increase health cost . ESBL probably even concern action take order decrease prevalence . Methods : All child age 0 16 year admit paediatric ward either colonize infect ESBL-producing strain include study . Identification ESBL-producing strain perform local microbiology laboratory use local available detection method . All strain collect investigation centre microbiological confirmation ESBL-production analysis gene associate ESBL phenotype sequencing . Because microbiological method differ laboratory , investigation centre therefore directly contact local microbiology laboratory order obtain information specific method use isolate ESBL strain feedback give examination strain study centre . Hospitals report case SPSU receive case report form ( CRF ) patient order get patient data , medical history implement infection control measure . Strains isolated potential ESBL store colony send study centre microbiological analysis . The shipment organise pay study centre . The shipment stain voluntary basis recommend quality control analyse molecular resistance mechanism . In order ease logistic obstacle , hospital ask provide contact information respective laboratory ; however address directly study centre order obtain microbiological information organize shipment strain . Data management entry perform study centre . This observational study . The study design SPSU preclude intervention . Analysis : Demographics report use standard descriptive statistic ( mean , median , percentage ) follow variable : age ( gestational age ) , sex , country origin , last stay outside Switzerland , past hospitalisation , direct transfer hospital abroad , prior antibiotic use , history urinary tract infection . Risk factor analysis ESBL infection vs. ESBL colonisation provide use standard statistical method logistic regression analysis follow variable : age ( gestational age ) , gender , main diagnosis , comorbidity , immune-deficiency , length hospital stay , length neonatal stay , length intensive care unit stay , medical device ( central venous line , endotracheal tube , urinary catheter ) , antibiotic use ( especially third generation cephalosporin ) . Furthermore , information isolation precaution measure outbreak investigation collect . Case Definition : All child ( age range : birth 16 year age ) colonize infected ESBL-producing enterobacteria accord antibiotic test local microbiology laboratory , include . All isolated strain send University Hospitals Geneva 's Microbiology Laboratory ( Head : Prof. J. Schrenzel ) confirmation specific ESBL culture technique ( double disc diffusion technique ) identification resistance gene in-house sequence . There exclusion criterion . Ethical issue : This descriptive study without direct effect patient care . All information obtain study already document patient ' chart therefore sign consent form ask . All data analyse anonymously store safe , password-protected computer . We obtain approval Ethical Committee University Hospitals Geneva begin study .</detailed_description>
