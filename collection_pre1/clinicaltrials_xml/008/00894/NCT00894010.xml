	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether patient usually abnormal electrical EEG response show flash light show reduction abnormal electrical activity take single dose 2 market drug ( carbamazepine levetiracetam ) . If , similar study future may able identify promise new drug epilepsy . Patients successfully complete screen visit , return 4 additional time receive either placebo ( 2 time ) single oral dose carbamazepine 400mg levetiracetam 1000mg random order . During study day , several procedure intermittent photosensitivity ( IPS ) assessment perform 5 pre-determined time course day , one pre-dose 4 post-dose .</brief_summary>
