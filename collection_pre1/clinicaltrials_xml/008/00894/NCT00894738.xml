	<brief_summary>The propose study aim begin multi-step process establish reliability validity hepatic triglyceride content ( HTGC ) carotid artery intima-media thickness ( IMT ) biomarkers cardiometablic risk child treat mental illness . The distribution HTGC carotid IMT—proximate indicator cardiometabolic risk—across range dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) -measured adiposity child treat antipsychotic agent characterize comparison healthy , untreated , non-psychiatric control , order estimate effect size future study incorporate marker . The ability HTGC IMT predict cardiometabolic risk measure commonly-used laboratory test , fast lipid , liver function test , C-reactive protein serum fibrinogen , assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Carotid artery intima medium wall thickness ( IMT ) one develop biomarkers cardiometabolic risk , establish reliability predictive validity , utilized surrogate endpoint cardiovascular disease progression FDA-reviewed registration study . This technique also use child adolescent without psychiatric disorder , indicate change IMT positively correlate metabolic syndrome criterion . Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 1H MRS ) quantify hepatic triglyceride content ( HTGC ) promise new marker cardiometabolic risk , especially give importance nocturnal circulating free fatty acid development insulin resistance lead type 2 diabetes . Fatty liver , related part obesity , common liver abnormality find child age 2-19 , one ten child manifest sign macrovascular steatohepatitis . 1H MRS well-established methodology use measure HTGC correlate well liver biopsy result . This technique study obese child without psychiatric disorder , widely consider optimal noninvasive mean measure HTGC . Unfortunately , neither promise method apply study cardiometabolic risk child psychiatric disorder . It important study biomarkers psychiatric population , individual subject treatment increase risk . Our group experience application sophisticate , gold standard technique measure cardiometabolic risk psychiatric population , is—to knowledge—the group US use sensitive methodology like stable isotopomer euglycemic clamp study pathophysiology lead diabetes cardiovascular disease mentally ill. An important goal study biomarkers ultimately determine commonly available conventional risk measure ( e.g. , lipid profile , adiposity measure ) use alone combination accurately identify child high risk , aid development target effective intervention .</detailed_description>
