	<brief_title>Performance Evaluation AMS CONTINUUM™ Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery main treatment localized prostate cancer . The common technique `` radical prostatectomy , '' involve remove prostate gland , seminal vesicle nearby lymph node . Radical prostatectomy major operation , suitable otherwise healthy men whose cancer appear spread.One technically challenging aspect surgery reconstruction interrupt urinary tract hand suture bladder neck anastomosis , bladder neck sewn urethra prostate remove . CONTINUUM™ ( study Device ) surgical device intend use part radical prostatectomy procedure . The Device facilitate approximation bladder neck urethral stump bring together hold tissue place adequate natural heal vesico-urethral anastomosis occur . CONTINUUM™ also approximate bladder urethral stump minimize extravasation , simultaneously provide conduit drainage urine bladder anastomotic site heals . The concept CONTINUUM™ device feasibility operation test animal human study . Pilot clinical study United States ( G060095 ) find majority Subjects receive discharged Device demonstrate water-tight vesico-urethral anastomosis first Device removal visit . Additionally , unanticipated adverse device effect ( UADEs ) report . The intent study verify CONTINUUM™ device performance across variety US sit physician use updated CONTINUUM™ device design modification physician train methodology Device implant removal technique prior initiation randomize US Pivotal study .</detailed_description>
