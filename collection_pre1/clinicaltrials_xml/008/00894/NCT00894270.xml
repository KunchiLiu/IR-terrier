	<brief_summary>Children adolescent type 1 diabetes mellitus require inject insulin daily . The injection technique reliably deposit insulin subcutaneous fat minimize inadvertent delivery either skin underlying muscle , associate suboptimal outcome . The use shorter , thinner needle reduce incidence intramuscular delivery associate reduced discomfort , increase risk shallow ( intradermal ) delivery loss insulin backflow skin surface . In current study , 240 subject ( child adult ) receive multiple injection small volume sterile air thigh abdomen use 5 mm Novofine® needle , simulate insulin injection perform two site use various injection technique ( perpendicular angle needle , without skin fold ) . Ultrasound visualisation inject air allow determination incidence intradermal intramuscular delivery use various delivery method trial . In addition , adult subject receive injection liquid test medium order determine incidence extent backflow . Qualitative data perceive discomfort information body composition also collect . This investigation form basis recommendation regard preferred injection technique 5 mm needle use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : The injection technique use child adolescent type 1 diabetes mellitus reliably deposit insulin subcutaneous fat minimize inadvertent intramuscular ( IM ) insulin injection . Surprisingly , injection technique varies among centre , tend protocol drive usually dependent needle length . The recommended injection procedure diabetic child centre include lift pinched skin fold either abdomen , thigh buttock perpendicular injection 8 mm syrinx angle injection 12.7 mm syrinx . However 8 12.7 mm needle , associate frequent IM injection rate 38 % 86 % respectively , report use perpendicular insertion ( 1 , 2 ) . IM injection regular , NPH glargine insulin associate rapid insulin release , variability glycaemic control increase risk hypoglycaemia ( 3-5 ) . The risk IM insulin deposition know related number variable include young age , male sex , low body mass index ( BMI ) , injection technique ( angle insertion lift pinched skinfold ) , needle length ( 1 , 2 , 6-8 ) . Reducing length insulin needle reduces incidence IM injection , however use 5 mm insulin needle may result insulin administer superficially dermal layer ( 9 , 10 ) . The consequence intradermal insulin deposition largely unknown , may lead increased insulin leakage , increase injection pain , increase immune response ( 10 ) . Little information know skin thickness , although vary age , obesity puberty ( personal observation ) . Smaller , thinner needle also associate reduced pain discomfort . However may cause great insulin loss injection . This latter issue may also reflect injection technique use anecdotal evidence suggest angle technique may reduce insulin loss . Objectives : Primary Objective : To locate compare simulated insulin injection child , adolescent adults diabetes give 5 mm needle use 45 degree 90 degree injection angle , without skin fold order provide injection guideline . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To study thickness dermis abdomen thigh child , adolescent adult normal weight weight/obese . 2 . To evaluate distance skin surface muscle fascia ( abdomen/thigh ) without compression skin child , adolescent adult normal weight weight/obese . 3 . To quantify amount backflow test medium skin surface adult investigate whether substantial clinically relevant difference among various technique . 4 . To assess comfort ease injection technique This trial single-centre open-label phase IV trial . The investigation perform three visit . Patients screen do first visit , 2 ± 1 day prior second visit day . The second third visit perform two week ± 3 day apart . At second visit day subject receive ( perform study nurse ) inject sterile air correspond 20 IU insulin ( 200 µl ) Novofine 5 mm needle perpendicularly abdomen thigh without skin fold , give total four injection visit . Following injection , sterile air deposition visualize ultra sound ( GELogic5 Phillips IU-22 machine ) . A 12.5 MHz linear array transducer use . This measure depth 3cm accurately . To assess dermis air injection 1cm standoff employ . This standard ultrasound technique examine change close transducer develop expertise use technique previous study . Because good visualization use standoff small , physiological , volume air reliably inject . Thickness ( ) dermis ( ii ) distance skin surface muscle fascia respective injection place also measure ultrasound without lift skin fold prior injection . The adult inject 200 µl test medium 5 mm needle perpendicularly abdomen thigh lift skin fold , provide additional four injection adult . Possible backflow skin surface absorb filter paper quantify scale . Injection speed measure time start end injection . After injection subject ask complete visual analog pain scale injection ask preference needle technique site injection . On third visit day subject inject 200µl sterile air ( perform study nurse ) 5 mm needle 45degrees without pinch-up technique abdomen thigh , provide total four injection subject . In addition , 200µl test medium 5 mm needle 45degrees abdomen thigh without lift skin fold inject adult . Possible backflow skin surface absorb filter paper quantify scale . The weigh scale must able measure three decimal metric system ( microgram ) . A 10 cm visual analog pain scale use assess discomfort injection comparison standard injection .</detailed_description>
