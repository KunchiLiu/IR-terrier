Many smoker may benefit prescription treatment alternative , include Zyban Chantix . In study , investigator propose develop evaluate stepped-care treatment algorithm would evaluate whether smoker receive treatment NRT supplement Zyban switch Chantix base : 1 ) initial response NRT ; 2 ) individual genetic factor find predict smoke cessation study evaluate treatment . This study continuation previous study show abstinence rate increase start nicotine patch therapy two week quit date . The investigator provide pre-cessation NRT participant initially . Those show favorable response early indicator success ( e.g. , smoke first week target quit-smoking date ) receive `` rescue '' treatment NRT treatment supplement Zyban , switch treatment Chantix remain NRT ( control ) .
