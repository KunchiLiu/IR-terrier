	<brief_title>Study Neurocognition Enhancing Agent Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims : Schizophrenia one disabling disorder afflict mankind . Despite low lifetime prevalence schizophrenia ( 1 % world-wide ) , enormous burden economic cost human suffer . There currently cure schizophrenia cause well understood . Patients schizophrenia also suffer negative symptom ( loss drive , apathy , poverty speech ) severe cognitive impairment especially memory , attention , process information - latter robustly correlate role function community . Addressing impairment effective intervention thus critically important present moment , effective treatment . Recent emerge data animal study pilot study small group patient schizophrenia suggest neurosteroids pregnenolone may relevant schizophrenia pathophysiology treatment neurocognitive impairment . This study 10-week randomise double-blind placebo-controlled trial efficacy safety pregnenolone . Our hypothesis patient schizophrenia randomize pregnenolone demonstrate significant improvement cognitive function negative symptom compare patient receive placebo . The primary aim study demonstrate efficacy pregnenolone comparison placebo patient schizophrenia assess change ( baseline ) composite score MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery ( MCCB ) , BACS Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) . Changes functionality assess University California Performance Based Skills Assessment ( UPSA ) . Safety assess laboratory test , well establish scale side effect well side-effects checklist . Objectives : To demonstrate efficacy pregnenolone comparison placebo patient schizophrenia cognitive impairment randomization ( Week 2 ) Week 10 use MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery , BACS , Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms , Performance Based Skills Assessment - Brief Version Clinical Global Impression -Improvement ( CGI-I ) .Additional safety data pregnenolone patient schizophrenia provide . Methodology : The propose study single-site , randomize , double blind placebo-controlled comparison adjunctive pregnenolone placebo . A total sample consist 120 clinically stable inpatient outpatient DSM IV schizophrenia , 60 subject randomize group . A best estimate diagnostic approach utilize , information Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV supplement information family informant , previous psychiatrist , medical record generate diagnosis . There 2 week , single-blind placebo lead-in evaluation phase , subject undergo baseline diagnostic medical testing , include physical examination , Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , Complete Blood Counts ( CBC ) , complete metabolic panel , urine toxicology , urinalysis . The study design confirm pilot study result ( n=9 per group ; total 18 patient 21 randomize complete least 4 week treatment ) large clinical trial ( n=60 per group , 120 patient total ) . Identical pilot study , patient see total 6 study visit ( every two week ) . The placebo arm essential standard therapy cognitive defect yet . Potential Benefits : While patient may personally help take part study , participation may lead knowledge help well understand illness . It may also lead well treatment cognitive deficit negative symptom schizophrenia . Potential Risks : Obtaining blood cause pain , bleeding , bruising , swell site needle prick . There risk question questionnaire might upset patient cause psychological distress . There know severe risk associate take pregnenolone .</detailed_description>

Subjects treat first generation and/or second generation antipsychotic previous 8 week longer , change dose â‰¥ 4 week screen . Women childbearing potential ( less two year postmenopausal surgically sterile ) , must negative urine pregnancy test screening must use highly effective method birth control least one month prior screen barrier method , implant , sexual abstinence vasectomise partner . Subjects DSMIV diagnosis alcohol substance dependence ( nicotine ) within last month . Subjects history significant head injury/trauma , loss consciousness ( LOC ) 1 hour , recur seizure result head injury , clear cognitive sequela injury , cognitive rehabilitation follow injury . Subjects history clinically significant neurological , metabolic , hepatic , renal , hematological , pulmonary , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , and/or urological disorder ( e.g. , unstable angina , seizure , cerebrovascular accident , decompensate congestive heart failure , CNS infection , HIV seropositivity ) , would pose risk patient participate study might confound result study . Active medical condition minor wellcontrolled exclusionary likely affect risk patient study result . Patients hormonesensitive tumour ( breast , uterine , prostate cancer ) exclude . Clinically significant abnormality physical examination , ECG , laboratory assessment . Pregnant woman sexually active woman childbearing potential , either surgicallysterile use appropriate method birth control ( urine pregnancy test perform baseline week 10 study exclude pregnancy ) . Women breastfeed . ECT treatment within last 3 month . Use oral contraceptive hormonal supplementation oestrogen . Subjects , opinion investigator , pose imminent risk suicide danger self others . Known allergy study medication . Participation another drug trial within 4 week study .</criteria>
