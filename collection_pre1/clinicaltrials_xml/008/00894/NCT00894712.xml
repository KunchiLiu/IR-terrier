	<brief_summary>The investigator plan investigate protective effect topical sulforaphane-containing broccoli-sprout extract ( BSE ) radiation-induced dermatitis woman undergo external-beam radiation therapy breast cancer . Topical sulforaphane induces phase 2 enzyme protective oxidant , electrophiles , inflammation ( Talalay Fahey , 2001 ) - generate ultraviolet ionize radiation . Previous work investigator ' group demonstrate sulforaphane treatment protect ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema human skin ( IRB protocol NA_00004897 ; Talalay et al . 2007 ) . This investigation extend investigator ' previous work employ ionize rather ultraviolet radiation . The investigator propose two part sequential protocol ( Study A Study B ) . Both study involve woman breast cancer undergone lumpectomy schedule adjuvant external beam radiation treatment . In study A , investigator validate technique measurement skin erythema use device call chromometer ; active agent apply ( 6 woman ) . Study B follow completion Study A . Study B involve application broccoli sprout extract ( BSE ) vehicle alone determine sulforaphane reduce radiation-induced erythema ( 27 woman ) . Four adjacent , 1.5-cm diameter areas-of-interest affect breast locate mean adhesive vinyl template accurately repeatedly place position . Two four area treat BSE ( active agent ) two vehicle ( inactive control ) . BSE apply three day weekly throughout 5-week period whole breast radiation . Erythema noninvasively quantify measure red-reflectance skin chromometer three time weekly throughout treatment . A total 33 patient enrol . The investigator ' objective determine quantify effect topical BSE radiation-induced skin erythema . This study employ standard , clinically-accepted radiation dos technique safe well tolerate . The safety tolerability oral topical broccoli sprout preparation well establish ; safety concern note . ( Shapiro et al . 2006 ; Dinkova-Kostova et al . 2007 ) .</brief_summary>
