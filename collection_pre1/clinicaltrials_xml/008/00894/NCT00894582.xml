	<brief_summary>Immediate post-operative abdominal compartment syndrome fear complication hernia repair patient `` loss abdominal domain . '' Replacement viscera within unyielding stiff abdominal wall may compromise perfusion intestine , elevate diaphragm , interfere ventilation . The component separation technique , use repair massive hernia , employ bilateral relax incision external oblique muscle fascia order approximate rectus abdominis muscle midline . Reducing large volume hernia abdominal cavity primary closure abdominal wall cause problem abdominal compartment pressure postoperative ventilation , investigator ' 13-year experience 250 case , see clinically , investigator seek understand . The investigator ' hypothesis release rectus muscle external oblique expand intra-abdominal compartment , reclaim lose domain , thus reduce abdominal pressure respiratory problem . The investigator previously report increased abdominal volume use component separation technique retrospective series , patient standardize collection data , pulmonary function test obtain series ( Hadad , press ) . The purpose study prospectively analyze effect surgical technique abdominal volume pulmonary function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Ventral Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With approval Institutional Review Board Northwestern University , twenty-one patient large ventral hernia select due large hernia size pool 130 patient undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction January 2007 December 2008 . No patient exclude base co-morbid condition . One patient 21 select exclude preoperative CT scan perform outside institution store incompatible format analysis . Another patient exclude decide intra-operatively could repair tension-free manner without component separation close mesh alone . Standard abdominal pelvic CT scan pulmonary function test perform immediately hernia repair , 3 month repair . Pulmonary function test interpret blinded member Department Pulmonology . Intra-operative peak airway pressure , bladder pressure , postoperative oxygen requirement , diagnosis pneumonia , cardio-respiratory complication record remain 19 patient . Routine patient demographic , clinical characteristic , postoperative course incidence recurrence prospectively collect patient . Statistical analysis perform intention-to-treat manner , use paired student 's t-test applicable .</detailed_description>
