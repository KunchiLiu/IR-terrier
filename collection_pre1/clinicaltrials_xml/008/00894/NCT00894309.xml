	<brief_summary>Fluid therapy important part management patient hemodynamic instability intensive care unit . By increase cardiac preload , aim elevate cardiac output ( CO ) thus restore hemodynamic condition patient preload responsive . By contrast , volume administration deleterious term pulmonary edema formation manifestation fluid overload , especially patient preload responsive . Functional dynamic parameter use heart-lung interaction , pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) stroke volume variation ( SVV ) consider accurate predictor preload responsiveness patient receive fully control mechanical ventilation . However , case spontaneous breathe activity heart-lung interaction index fail predict fluid responsiveness , one need parameter able reliably predict hemodynamic response fluid administration . A new index could indicate fluid responsiveness , so-called fluid responsiveness index ( FRI ) , elaborate . The advantage could use patient control mechanical ventilation well patient fully adapt mechanical ventilation . The FRI base upon analysis continuous arterial continuous central venous pressure . The FRI determine relation cardiac respiratory activity ; evaluate mean power spectrum analysis pressure record . The aim study test value FRI predict hemodynamic response fluid infusion patient hemodynamic instability receive fully control mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>
