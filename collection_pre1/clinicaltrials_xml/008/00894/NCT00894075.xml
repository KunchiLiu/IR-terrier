	<detailed_description>Hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) rare inherit form rickets osteomalacia cause inactivating mutation gene encode tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme alkaline phosphatase ( TNSALP ) . The prevalence disease think 1:100,000 although markedly high small Canadian Mennonite population ( Fraser 1957 , Chodirker 1990 ) . Inheritance autosomal recessive dominant , penetrance variable result wide range clinical expressivity . HPP differs form rickets osteomalacia serum level calcium phosphorus generally normal even elevate ( Whyte 2002 ) . Low circulating level alkaline phosphatase elevate serum urine level TNSALP substrates inorganic pyrophosphate ( PPi ) , pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ( PLP ) phosphoethanolamine ( PEA ) biochemical hallmark inborn error metabolism . Disease severity HPP inversely related age symptom presentation . The severe case occur utero almost invariably result death , generally due pulmonary compromise . Infants present first six month life 50 % mortality . Children adults less severe disease frequent fracture , bone pain , bow long bone muscle weakness , morbidity generally cumulative . Some patient ambulate independently end wheelchair-bound .</detailed_description>
