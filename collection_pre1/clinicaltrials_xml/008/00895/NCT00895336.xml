	<brief_summary>Abstract : Current evidence suggest enteric flora primary trigger chronic mucosal inflammation Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ( IBD ) , Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) . Studies use probiotic administration modify flora either induction maintenance remission IBD mixed result . Whether probiotic may exert anti-inflammatory effect IBD know . The investigator hypothesize daily administration probiotic , Lactobacillus GG , four week reduce objective marker mucosal inflammation pediatric UC patient . The investigator enroll 20 UC patient remission mild disease activity . These patient one month period observation without intervention . They receive Lactobacillus GG ( Culturelle ) , 1010 CFU mouth twice day four week ( 28 day ) . At baseline Day 28 , day 56 clinical disease activity measure use Pediatric UC Activity Index ( PUCAI ) , blood sample determination circulate granulocyte pSTAT3+ activation obtain , stool sample determination fecal calprotectin obtain . In addition , =the investigator sample subject saliva determine salivary glycan phenotype surrogate marker change mucosal glycan expression response probiotic administration . The investigator anticipate circulate granulocyte pSTAT3+ activation fecal calprotectin , establish biomarkers colonic inflammation , reduce subject receive Lactobacillus GG . Completion propose study determine whether Lactobacillus GG reduce mucosal inflammation pediatric UC , provide information design large randomized trial . The investigator ' study design novel first probiotic study child UC measure outcomes utilizing biomarkers fecal calprotectin pSTAT3+ circulate granulocyte .</brief_summary>
