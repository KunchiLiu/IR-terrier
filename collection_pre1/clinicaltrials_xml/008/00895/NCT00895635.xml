	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) disorder affect 8 million people United States . As result decrease blood flow leg , people PAD may experience leg pain difficulty walk . This study examine effectiveness two exercise programs—a treadmill walk program aerobic arm exercise program—at increase walk distance decrease leg pain people PAD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Two Exercise Training Programs Reduce Leg Pain People With Peripheral Arterial Disease ( The EXERT Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAD condition occur atherosclerotic plaque build peripheral artery restrict blood flow . People PAD often experience reduce blood flow leg , may cause painful leg cramp walking , know intermittent claudication . Claudication affect 4 million people United States , many people condition walk ½ 2 block leg pain begin occur . Regular treadmill walk show effective increase walk distance reduce claudication people PAD . However , walk treadmill may prove difficult people PAD usually cause increased leg pain , may reduce exercise frequency . Aerobic arm exercise cause leg pain may effective way people PAD improve overall cardiovascular fitness increase amount exercise . The purpose study compare effectiveness treadmill exercise program aerobic arm exercise program reducing symptom claudication improve walk ability people PAD . This study enroll people PAD claudication . At baseline study visit , participant complete treadmill walk test ; blood collection ; questionnaires ass walk status , daily activity level , quality life , mood . One week baseline visit , participant attend study visit assessment forearm leg muscle blood flow hand-bike test measure upper body strength use arm cycle ergometer . The ergometer device bicycle pedal people move use arm . Participants randomly assign either treadmill exercise training program , arm ergometry exercise program , control group . Participants treadmill exercise train program attend supervise program one four study site exercise treadmill 1 hour three time week 12 week . Participants arm ergometry exercise program attend supervise program one four study site exercise use arm cycle ergometer ( hand-bike ) 1 hour three time week 12 week . Participants group also receive write instruction exercise . Participants control group continue receive usual care regular doctor treatment PAD provide write exercise instruction . Once week 12 week , participant control group attend study visit discuss health problem . All participant ask monitor daily exercise 3 separate week 12-week period wear accelerometer , measure record physical activity . They also record exercise habit write diary . All participant attend study visit 2 separate day Weeks 6 12 repeat baseline test . From Weeks 12 24 , participant encourage continue exercise least three time week 30 minute . Every 4 week , study researcher call participant offer encouragement answer question . At Week 23 , participant wear accelerometer keep exercise diary 1 week . All participant attend final study visit Week 24 repeat baseline testing .</detailed_description>
