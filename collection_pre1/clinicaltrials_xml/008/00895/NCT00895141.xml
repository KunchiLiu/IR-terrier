	<brief_title>Effect Saturated Fat Large Low-density Lipoprotein ( LDL ) High-density Lipoprotein ( HDL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased saturate fat intake know elevate plasma level low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , however , less know regard effect saturate fat lipoprotein subclass . We previously show , context reduce carbohydrate diet , saturate fat induced increase LDL cholesterol apparently due increase large , buoyant LDL without increase small , dense LDL . This finding support previous dietary intervention study show correlation saturate fat intake large LDL . In case , increase large LDL correlate increase large HDL . In study , test follow specific hypothesis regard change plasma lipoprotein induce diet high myristic acid saturate fat derive primarily dairy source individual LDL subclass pattern B : 1 ) coordinate increase level large HDL particle consider anti-atherogenic large LDL particle less strongly associate increase CVD risk small LDL ; 2 ) change lipoprotein profile result high proportion pattern B individual convert LDL subclass pattern A ( predominance large LDL ) ; 3 ) coordinate increase large HDL LDL due common underlie pathway . The latter hypothesis address assay cholesterol ester transfer protein ( CETP ) , hepatic lipase ( HL ) , lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) .</detailed_description>
