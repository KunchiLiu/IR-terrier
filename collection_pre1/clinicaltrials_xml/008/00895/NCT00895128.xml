	<brief_title>Study Erlotinib Combination With Dasatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Erlotinib hydrochloride dasatinib design block protein think cause cancer cell grow . These drug may help slow growth tumor . Study Drug Dose Level : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level erlotinib hydrochloride dasatinib base join study . Up 4 dose level study drug combination test . There 3-6 participant enrol dose level study drug combination . The first group participant receive low dose level erlotinib hydrochloride ( Group 1 ) . If Group 1 tolerate dose level , next group ( Group 2 ) receive high dose . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see ( Groups 2-4 ) . This continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . However , Group 1 tolerate first dose level , next group receive low dose ( call Dose Level -1 ) . If dose level still intolerable , third group receive even low dose ( call Dose Level -2 ) . The dose dasatinib base group . Groups 1 3 receive low dose Groups 2 4 receive high dose . After high tolerable dose find , additional 10 participant , call `` expansion group , '' receive study drug combination dose . Study Drug Administration : Erlotinib hydrochloride take mouth 1 time day every day . You take erlotinib hydrochloride empty stomach either 1 hour eat 2 hour eat . Depending dose level assign , also take dasatinib mouth 1 2 time day every day . Each cycle 28 day . Study Visits : You single study visit cycle . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your performance status record . - You ask list drug may take , include over-the-counter drug . - You ask symptom may . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test . PD test use look level study drug body may affect disease . After first 2 cycle every 2 3 cycle , CT MRI scan check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long benefit . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Follow-up Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug , follow-up visit . You ask return unused study drug . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your performance status record . - You ask list drug may take , include over-the-counter drug . - You ask symptom may . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . This investigational study . Dasatinib erlotinib hydrochloride FDA approve commercially available . Dasatinib FDA approve treatment acute lymphoid leukemia ( ALL ) chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . Erlotinib hydrochloride FDA approve treatment lung cancer pancreatic cancer . The use drug together investigational . Up 48 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
