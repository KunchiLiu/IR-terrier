	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess clinical efficacy proton pump inhibitor comparison aerosolize swallowed steroid treatment eosinophilic esophagitis ( EE ) . EE increasingly recognize disorder associate dysphagia food impaction . The presence anatomical abnormality esophagus longitudinal furrow , corrugate ring narrow caliber esophagus friable mucosa classic endoscopic finding . Diagnosis establish histologic find large number ( &gt; 15 ) eosinophil per high power field . The underlie pathologic mechanism remain poorly understood food allergy aeroallergens implicate . It well know gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) may cause esophageal eosinophilia , unclear whether complex relationship exist GERD EE , recent data suggests . Furthermore , large number patient clinical presentation endoscopic finding highly suggestive EE confirm histology respond favorably proton pump inhibitor . The aim study ( 1 ) compare clinical efficacy aerosolize swallow Fluticasone Esomeprazole treatment eosinophilic esophagitis , ( 2 ) determine whether proton pump inhibitor effective treatment eosinophilic esophagitis , ( 3 ) determine number patient eosinophilic esophagitis coexist gastroesophageal reflux disease , ( 4 ) correlate change eosinophil count improvement symptom therapy .</brief_summary>
