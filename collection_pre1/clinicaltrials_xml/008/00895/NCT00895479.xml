	<brief_summary>Patients renal failure hemodialysis depend adequate sustain vascular access . This achieved surgical placement synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) graft . These patient frequently experience graft complication arise development smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) neointimal hyperplasia proximity graft-vein anastomosis . Such complication eventually lead stenosis , access thrombosis graft failure . Trinam速 develop prolong graft survival . It combination product consist replication deficient Adenovirus contain human Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D ( Ad-VEGF-D ) gene biodegradable local delivery device ( collar ) make collagen . At end surgical procedure insert PTFE graft collagen collar apply around anastomosis seal collagen surgical sealant . This procedure create reservoir site anastomosis collagen collar . The adenoviral vector inject reservoir , localize expression transgene site anastomosis . Expression VEGF-D show vascular protective role inhibit SMC neointimal proliferation , therefore expression VEGF-D prolong graft survival .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients end stage renal disease undergo either initial placement replacement ( failure previous vascular access ) endtoside endtoend 6.0 mm synthetic PTFE arteriovenous hemodialysis access arm graft . Male female age 18 year . Patients sign informed consent form . Patients expect undergo dialysis nominate facility duration study . Patients agree participate additional four year gene therapy safety monitoring . Patients willing agree kidney transplant four week post treatment Trinam速 . Patients undergone arterial venous mapping ensure adequate appropriate access site available placement either endtoside endtoend 6.0 mm synthetic PTFE arteriovenous hemodialysis access arm graft without addition Trinam速 . Patients unable understand sign consent form . Patients undergo surgical revision exist graft .
