	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial see increase dos rituximab safe effective initial treatment indolent B-cell lymphoma . Rituximab ( Rituxan ) type drug call `` antibody '' specifically target B-cell lymphoma cell , approve FDA treatment indolent B-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma certain type non-hodgkin lymphoma . Standard dose currently use may achieve maximal efficacy . Higher dos show safe clinical trial , may offer superior efficacy current standard dose . This trial also employ intermittent maintenance dos rituximab standard dose , show prolong remission survival patient relapse indolent B-cell lymphoma . This trial design show higher dose rituximab plus maintenance rituximab achieve similarly good result chemotherapy approach , without chemotherapy-related toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Dose Rituximab Initial Treatment Indolent B-Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- All participant receive increased-dose rituximab vein arm week 4 week ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 initial 28-day study cycle ) . This first cycle study treatment call Induction Phase . If participant responds well Induction Phase , may continue Maintenance Therapy Phase , receive low dose rituximab every three month 2 year . - During Induction Phase , follow procedure take place participant receive dose rituximab : medical review , physical exam , performance status , ECG . Blood test draw 30-60 minute first dose rituximab Day 1 . Samples draw immediately dose 30-60 minute dose Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 . - During Maintenance Therapy Phase , follow procedure take place participant receive dose rituximab : medical review , physical exam , performance status , ECG , blood test response assessment CT scan .</detailed_description>
