	<detailed_description>Muscle relaxant part balance anesthesia regimen . So far , evidence give neuromuscular block improve intubate condition protects laryngeal morbidity . The doctrine , however , neuromuscular block improve surgical condition consequently patient care , lack evidence base clinical trial . This study , therefore , design test clinically hypothesis neuromuscular block improve surgical condition . One major problem setting , however , difficult measure `` good '' `` good '' surgical condition . We therefore suggest surrogate test hypothesis . The primary endpoint postoperative patient-controlled analgesic demand adequate pain control . The secondary endpoint incidence intraoperative event reflect muscle relaxation anesthesia , define movement limbs abdominal wall , breathing , buck cough ventilator , incision-to-suture-time , surgeon 's anesthesiologist 's opinion operating condition assess visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , postoperative pulmonary function . We investigate patient schedule elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy general anesthesia . The study design allow optimal condition test hypothesis . This result two experimental group represent two establish anesthesia regimen ( n = 25 per group ) . Patients group `` NMB '' anesthetize without muscle relaxant . Patients group `` NMB '' anesthetize use drug `` NMB '' group additionally receive neuromuscular block agent induce deep neuromuscular block induction anesthesia skin suture . Anesthesia induce propofol fentanyl . Airway manage use ProSealÂ® Laryngeal mask allow insertion gastric tube . Anesthesia maintain desflurane inhalation remifentanil infusion BIS control . The group NMB receive rocuronium maintain deep neuromuscular block ( T2 &lt; 2 ) fascia suture . Neuromuscular block reverse sugammadex . Saline boli apply patient group `` NMB '' every 25-35 min order keep anesthesiologist blind . Post-operatively , 15 min interval stay discharge recovery room patient ' level consciousness assess , update Aldrete score obtain . In co-operative patient 5-s head lift test , 5-s arm lift test , swallow 20 ml water , 5-s eye open test perform . To achieve pain control , microprocessor-controlled PCA system use . The patient ' respiratory function assess induction anesthesia , 5 minute tracheal extubation , 30 minute later postanesthesia care unit , six hour later ward use portable use spirometry device .</detailed_description>
