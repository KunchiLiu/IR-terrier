	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Therapeutic Vaccine PEP223 Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer growth influence male hormone testosterone . Treatment drug stop production testosterone often result decrease tumor inhibition growth . This particularly important prior radiotherapy , since radiation well focused prostate result less frequent less severe side effect radiation . Most drug use date stop production testosterone disadvantage initially may cause rise testosterone level production effectively block . The new drug investigate trial vaccine . The vaccine offer different treatment modality since interferes different level hormonal axis drive testosterone production ; cause initial surge . In trial vaccine administer three time , testosterone level monitor total period three month .</detailed_description>
