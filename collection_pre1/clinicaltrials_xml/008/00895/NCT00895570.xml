	<brief_title>The Effects Modafinil Counteract Adverse Metabolic Consequences Sleep Restriction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The occurrence diagnosis DM2 complication increase , lead rise treatment cost represent considerable portion U.S. health care budget . Although treatment impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) common , IGT diagnosis increase likelihood progression DM2 . Careful attention glycemic control primary treatment goal DM2 patient , glucose control reduce severity microvascular , macrovascular , complication . Recent research indicate sleep loss could previously unrecognized risk factor DM2 . As sleep restriction become endemic condition develop country , possible sleep loss contributes recent epidemic DM2 . Protecting sleep increase sleep duration quality DM2 IGT patient may provide inexpensive , relatively easy implement intervention reduce risk disease onset delay disease progression improve glucose tolerance . Furthermore , measurement endocrine , metabolic , cardiovascular parameter propose study may provide insight mechanisms sleep extension improve glucose tolerance pathophysiological condition . The propose study examine quantifies adult link insufficient sleep increase insulin resistance , impaired insulin secretion , reduce non-insulin-dependent glucose utilization sleepy brain . The propose study capitalize upon unique pharmacological characteristic modafinil reverse excessive sleepiness address mechanisms sleep restriction may impact metabolism via excessive sleepiness . This study may lead countermeasure adverse health impact chronic insufficient sleep , increasingly common lifestyle may ultimately contribute development Metabolic Syndrome DM2 via alteration glucose metabolism brain glucose utilization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must also demonstrate full understanding requirement demand study . Individuals must willing follow regular sleepwake schedule . Sleep/wake history . During completion preliminary telephone write screening questionnaire , potential volunteer ask number question present , past desire habitual sleep/wake schedule , include habitual desire bedtime , waketimes , nap time . Those potential volunteer history nightwork precede 3year period travel across &gt; 2 time zone 3 month prior study exclude . Individuals unable unwilling follow regular sleepwake schedule exclude study . Drug/Alcohol Use . Volunteers must drugfree ( include nicotine ) moderate use caffeine alcohol entire duration study . No medication ( prescription counter ) significantly affect circadian rhythm , endocrine physiology , sleep allow . They must history drug alcohol dependency . No caffeine alcohol allow one week prior inpatient portion protocol . A comprehensive toxicological analysis blood urine prescription medication , nonprescription medication , drug abuse , caffeine , nicotine alcohol metabolite carry verification report nonuse initial screen day admission laboratory verification . Evaluation Medical Suitability . Only healthy , nonobese men select study . Subjects must free acute , chronic debilitate medical condition . Normality establish basis clinical history , electrocardiogram , clinical biochemical screening test blood urine , physical examination conduct licensed physician . Any subject symptom active illness ( e.g. , fever , leukocytosis , hypertension ) exclude study . Given wide range illness encounter medical practice , would possible provide comprehensive list every disease could serve ground exclusion subject . However , follow list illness would certainly ground exclusion : Chronobiologic Disorders , Sleep Disorders , Diseases Cardiovascular System , Disorders Kidney Urinary Tract , Infectious Diseases , Disorders Gastrointestinal System , Disorders Immune System , Connective Tissue Joints , Disorders Hematopoietic System , Neoplastic Diseases , Endocrine Metabolic Diseases , Neurologic Disorders ; significant impairment visual system . Evaluation Psychiatric/Psychological Suitability . Each potential volunteer complete series psychological questionnaire receive comprehensive psychological examination clinical psychologist experience psychological screening subject study . Individuals evidence psychopathology standardize questionnaire structure interview exclude study . Individuals history psychiatric illness psychiatric disorder exclude . Individuals unaware specific psychiatric diagnosis history treat antidepressant , neuroleptic medication major tranquilizer exclude study . However , personal history limit prior counsel psychotherapy ( e.g. , adjustment reaction ) necessarily exclusionary . Potential subject evaluate Axis II personality type might interfere protocol compliance personal ability tolerate condition study , temporal isolation confinement .</criteria>
