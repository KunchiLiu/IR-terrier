	<brief_summary>Despite best surgical effort , complete removal mesothelioma possible approximately 30 % patient . When surgical removal complete , chemotherapy follow radiation therapy recommend effort improve control cancer survival . This combination treatments call TRIMODALITY therapy . Unfortunately , chance tumor come back TRIMODALITY therapy remain high . When surgical removal complete possible , patient may receive chemo and/or radiation therapy achieve control cancer , chance tumor growth remain high chance long term survival remain low . The combination Pemetrexed ( Alimta ) Cisplatin approve one standard chemotherapy drug combination treatment advance Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma , likely group patient may benefit potentially cured therapy . In effort achieve good chance complete removal cancer long term survival , investigator interested use drug combination Pemetrexed + Cisplatin surgery offer radiation therapy surgery .</brief_summary>
