	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Immunosuppressive therapy , alemtuzumab cyclosporine , may improve bone marrow function increase blood cell count . Giving alemtuzumab together cyclosporine may effective treatment severe aplastic anemia acquire marrow failure . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give alemtuzumab together cyclosporine see well work treat patient severe aplastic anemia acquire marrow failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab Low-Dose Cyclosporine Treating Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia Acquired Marrow Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety alemtuzumab low-dose cyclosporine , define occurrence adverse effect , patient severe aplastic anemia single lineage acquire marrow failure . - Determine efficacy regimen , term overall survival , hematological response ( partial complete response , include time response ) failure-free survival ( failure define response , chronic treatment-maintained response , relapse ) , patient . Secondary - Evaluate incidence adverse effect treatment . - Evaluate long-term safety alemtuzumab treatment . - Determine time achieve complete hematological response . - Determine proportion patient maintain hematological response free treatment . - Determine incidence relapse respond patient . - Determine incidence severe infection . - Determine requirement IV antibiotic antifungal therapy . - Determine requirement red cell platelet transfusion . - Determine incidence CMV reactivation . - Determine kinetics immune reconstitution . - Determine incidence paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone ( lymphoid myeloid ) development . - Determine incidence clonal evolution ( i.e. , karyotypic abnormality secondary myelodysplasia/leukemia ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously day 1-5* . Patients also receive oral cyclosporine begin day 7 continue ≥ 180 day , follow taper accord clinical condition . NOTE : *Patients single lineage aquired marrow failure receive alemtuzumab day 1-4 . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
