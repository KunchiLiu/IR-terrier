	<brief_summary>Background : - National Institutes Health ( NIH ) researcher study immune cell ( white blood cell ) good understand human body defense system work adjust regulates , change system make person sick . - To study cell patient problem immune system , researcher would like collect sample skin cell patient immune system disorder compare skin cell take healthy volunteer . By study cell , researcher hope determine whether cell modify create new kind personalize gene therapy would attempt cure immune diseases future . Objectives : - To obtain skin cell patient immune system disorder healthy volunteer research comparison purpose . Eligibility : - Patients age 2 85 immune system disorder . - Healthy volunteer age 18 85 . - Both group select eligible participant exist NIH study immune system disorder . Design : - Researchers may take two biopsy participant arm , leg , abdomen , back . - The biopsy site numb local anesthetic clean sample take . - The punch skin biopsy needle insert skin rotate remove small circle skin ( approximately 1/4 3/8 inch across ) . The area close bandage stitch , cover dress . Any stitch remove 7 10 day . - Tissue sample collect study store future research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Establishing Fibroblast-Derived Cell Lines From Skin Biopsies Patients With Immunodeficiency Immunodysregulation Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol design adjunct NIAID IRB approve protocol allow genetic testing , may include screen protocols patient rare primary immunodeficiency immunodysregulation disorder . Patients deem sufficient research interest review outside medical record , clinical evaluation , test may invite participate study . Healthy volunteer also invite participate source control sample research test . After consent enrollment study , skin punch biopsy obtain establish dermal fibroblast cell line research study direct understanding genetic biochemical base disease . Cell line also use investigate utility induce pluripotent stem cell ( iPS ) lymphocyte derivation target gene correction . The nasal epithelial scraping use research purpose grow primary nasal respiratory epithelial cell line . These cell line use functional study test virus replication . These functional study allow u identify new primary immunodeficiency may present primarily recurrent persistent low respiratory tract virus infections.Results potential impact medical care relay refer physician applicable , patient refer appropriate NIH protocol additional clinical evaluation treatment . The study enroll 200 patient healthy volunteer next 5 year .</detailed_description>
