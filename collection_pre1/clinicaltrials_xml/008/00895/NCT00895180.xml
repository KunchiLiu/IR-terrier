	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , ramucirumab anti-PDGFR alpha monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 ( Olaratumab ) , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well ramucirumab anti-PDGFR alpha monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 work treat patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ramucirumab Anti-PDGFR Alpha Monoclonal Antibody IMC-3G3 Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess progression-free survival rate 6 month treatment ramucirumab anti-PDGFR alpha monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . Secondary - To evaluate acute late toxicity associate regimen . - To assess objective tumor response rate . - To estimate overall survival patient . - To describe pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile immunogenicity regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients sequentially assign 1 2 treatment group . - Group 1 : Patients receive ramucirumab IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Group 2 : Patients receive anti-PDGFR alpha monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 IV 60-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
