	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sometimes tumor may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor , 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy intensity-modulated radiation therapy , may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know whether observation effective radiation therapy treat patient meningioma . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study observation see well work compare radiation therapy treat patient grade I , grade II , grade III meningioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observation Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Grade I , Grade II , Grade III Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate rate progression-free survival 3 year patient low-risk meningioma undergo observation patient intermediate- high-risk meningioma undergoing radiotherapy . Secondary - To study concordance , lack thereof , central parent institution histopathologic diagnosis , grading , subtyping . - To estimate rate overall survival 3 year patient . - To estimate incidence rate acute late adverse event â‰¥ grade 2 patient intermediate- high-risk meningioma undergoing radiotherapy . - To evaluate MRI image predictor central neuroradiology review diagnosis , failure , 3 year . - To evaluate adherence protocol-specific target normal tissue radiotherapy parameter . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assign 1 3 group accord risk . - Group 1 ( low-risk disease ) : Patients undergo observation . - Group 2 ( intermediate-risk disease ) : Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) daily 5 day week 6 week . - Group 3 ( high-risk disease ) : Patients undergo IMRT daily 5 day week 6 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
