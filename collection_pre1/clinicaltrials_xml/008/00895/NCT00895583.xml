All female male subject biologically capable child must agree commit use reliable method birth control duration study 3 month last dose test article . A subject biologically capable child even use contraceptive sexual partner sterile use contraceptive . At Randomization : Ninety ( 90 ) 150 day posttransplantation . Treatment tacrolimus inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) inhibitor initiate less equal 30 day transplantation remain 30 day prior randomization . At Screening : Recipients multiple organ transplant ( i.e. , prior concurrent transplantation organ include prior renal transplant . ) Recipients adult pediatric en bloc kidney transplant . Recipients require require desensitization protocol . Known history focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis ( MPGN ) . Evidence active systemic localize major infection , determine investigator . Received investigational drug device le equal 30 day prior transplantation .
