	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Oral Senicapoc Allergen Challenge Atopic Asthmatic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based unmet medical need new agent treatment asthma role KCa3.1 function several different cell type involve inflammatory response , effect see animal model allergic asthma , reasonable explore utility senicapoc , KCa3.1 blocker , novel treatment asthma . This study test ability senicapoc alleviate bronchospasm induce allergen challenge patient allergic asthma . It analogous study perform animal senicapoc demonstrate ability reduce airway resistance hyper-responsiveness induce airway challenge antigen carbachol , respectively . This study also first test ability senicapoc reduce airway inflammation , key pathophysiologic process asthma . In summary , demonstrate safety profile across wide range dos human efficacy animal model allergic bronchospasm hyper-responsiveness , initiation exploratory study senicapoc treatment asthma justify .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>History asthma ( define Global Initiative Asthma definition previously treat asthma ) ; Baseline ( prebronchodilator ) force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) ≥70 % predict ; Clinically acceptable medical history , physical examination , 12 lead ECG , vital sign , clinical laboratory test ) ; Positive response screen skin prick test either house dust mite , cat hair , grass pollen ; A positive inhaled methacholine challenge PC20 ≤ 8 mg/mL ( within 6 month prior Screening Visit 1 ) ; Screening allergen challenge demonstrate subject experience early late asthmatic response . The early asthmatic response must include fall FEV1 equal 20 % post saline value , least one occasion , 5 30 minute final concentration allergen . The late asthmatic response must include fall FEV1 equal 15 % post saline value , least three occasion , two must consecutive , 4 10 hour final concentration allergen ; Nonsmoker ( refrain tobacco usage product contain nicotine 6 month prior Screening Visit 1 ) ; Able willing give write informed consent participate study . Any subject experience allergic reaction drug suggest increase potential hypersensitivity senicapoc ( e.g . clotrimazole ) ; Previous ingestion senicapoc ( ICA17043 ) prior Screening Visit 1 ; Any condition might interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism , and/or excretion drug ; Respiratory tract infection asthma exacerbation within 4 week first Screening Visit within period Screening Visit 1 Day 1 unless study physician believe lung function unaffected ( great 10 % decrease baseline FEV1 ) event ; Considering schedule undergo surgical procedure duration study ; History alcohol and/or drug abuse within 2 year prior Screening Visit 1 ; Donation blood ( &gt; 450 mL ) significant loss blood within 56 day prior Screening Visit 1 ; Received commercially licensed investigational product within 30 day prior Screening Visit 1 receive unlicensed investigational product within 90 day prior Screening Visit 1 ; History chronic hepatitis B C , positive test hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody , history HIV infection , demonstration HIV antibodies ; A positive qualitative urine drug test , positive urine breath alcohol test , positive urine cotinine CO breath test first Screening visit Day 1 ; Use oral inhale intranasal corticosteroid , long act beta agonist ( e.g. , salmeterol formoterol ) , leukotriene receptor antagonist ( e.g. , zafirlukast montelukast ) , theophylline , nedocromil sodium , cromolyn sodium , zileuton , anticholinergic agent within 28 day prior first Screening visit ; Use oral antihistamine within 1 week prior first Screening visit ; Symptomatic hay fever Screening Visits Day 1 ; A &gt; 10 pack year cigarette history .</criteria>
