	<brief_summary>One major complication heart surgery kidney injury , occur 30 % patient associated poor outcome include death . We find patient whose hemoglobin concentration surgery low normal ( i.e. , anemic ) particularly high risk complication , likely hemoglobin concentration drop low level surgery , reduce delivery oxygen kidney , increase blood loss , necessitate blood transfusion . We others show event individually harmful kidney , lead kidney injury . We believe prevent event occur , result reduce risk kidney injury , transfuse anemic patient least 1 day surgery rather surgery . In anemic patient undergo cardiac surgery , prophylactic transfusion red blood cell ( RBCs ) surgery reduce risk acute kidney injury ( AKI ) surgery mitigate three inter-related risk factor AKI .</brief_summary>
