	<brief_title>Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) Imatinib Mesylate ( Gleevec ) Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Androgen-independent prostate cancer second common cause cancer death men . These patient limit treatment option . Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) single active agent treatment hormone refractory prostate cancer . Phase II clinical trial include docetaxel combination microtubule inhibitor show 60-70 % prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) decline great 50 % 30-40 % measurable disease response . However , duration response limit roughly 22 week . Combinations new agent need increase rate duration response exist docetaxel contain combination . The platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) A frequently express ( 80 % ) primary bone marrow metastasis human prostate cancer ( PC ) . Recent experimental evidence suggest activation PDGFR/PDGF oncogenic development and/or progression PC . There also evidence PC cell express PDGF promote PDGFR expression endothelial cell neo- angiogenesis . Together , experimental evidence support inhibition PDGFR may therapeutic benefit advanced prostate cancer patient . Gleevec ( Imatinib mesylate ) potent inhibitor PDGFR . Consistent observation , treatment Gleevec experimental prostate cancer mouse model well paclitaxel alone reduce bone metastasis antitumor effect strong combination . In phase I study heavily pretreated hormone refractory PC patient , Gleevec 600 mg/daily lead-in 30 day follow Gleevec 600 mg/daily Paclitaxel 30mg/m2 weekly x4 week every 6 week induce &gt; 50 % PSA decline 7 % 38 % patient respectively acceptable toxicity . These observation suggest combination merit investigation . With high-dose docetaxel ( 70mg/m^2 ) single active agent hormone refractory prostate cancer data exist use high-docetaxel Gleevec , phase I/II study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination optimum dose phase II trial warrant . Gleevec expect affect activation status sensitive receptor tyrosine kinase target associate signal effector tumor cell neovasculature . However , fully establish extent alteration target /or molecule signal pathway essential Gleevec 's antitumor activity prostate cancer patient . It also unknown whether preexist molecular change prostate tumor individual patient could affect Gleevec 's activity even presence target . Therefore , assessment expression level and/or presence mutation select molecule specimens patient clinical trial may contribute various way : 1. understand requirement elicit inhibit response combination , 2. whether add targeted agent may improve response and/or 3. whether selection patient might benefit base tumor profile . Thus , whenever possible specimen form primary and/or metastatic site retrieve and/or obtain perform analysis .</detailed_description>
