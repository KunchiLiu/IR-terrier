	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study REOLYSIN® Combination With Paclitaxel Carboplatin Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With KRAS EGFR Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reovirus Serotype 3 - Dearing Strain ( REOLYSIN® ) naturally occur , ubiquitous , non-enveloped human reovirus . Reovirus show replicate selectively Ras-transformed cell cause cell lysis . Activating mutation ras mutation oncogene signal ra pathway may occur many 80 % human tumor . The specificity reovirus Ras-transformed cell , couple relatively nonpathogenic nature human , make attractive anti-cancer therapy candidate . Given ability reovirus replicate cause oncolysis Ras-activated cell , high incidence K-ras mutation lung cancer , Ras-mediated activation often encounter EGFR-addicted tumor , administration REOLYSIN® combination chemotherapy expect result enhance clinical benefit non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient K-ras mutation and/or EGFR aberrant activation tumor . Patients de novo acquire EGFR mutation tumor confer resistance EGFR TKIs ( e.g . T790 ) expect benefit well . This single arm , open-label , Phase 2 study REOLYSIN® give intravenously paclitaxel carboplatin every 3 week ( 21 day define cycle ) NSCLC patient tumor drive pathway . Paclitaxel dose 175 mg/m2 give i.v . 3 hour infusion Day 1 follow carboplatin give i.v . AUC 5 mg/mL•minute . REOLYSIN® give 60 min Day 1 ( start completion carboplatin infusion ) , Days 2 - 5 . The treatment cycle repeat every 21 day . Patients receive 4 6 cycle paclitaxel carboplatin , treat physician 's discretion accord standard practice , conjunction REOLYSIN® . After completion 4 6 cycle paclitaxel carboplatin , REOLYSIN® may continue monotherapy Days 1-5 21 day cycle evidence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may continue receive therapy protocol , provide experience either progressive disease unacceptable drug-related toxicity respond either supportive care dose reduction .</detailed_description>
