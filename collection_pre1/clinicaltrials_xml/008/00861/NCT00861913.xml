	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma That Can Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess anti-tumor activity safety profile single agent Pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact Pazopanib circulating level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . II . To examine association tumor response B-Raf N-Ras mutation . III . To examine pre/post-treatment expression level VEGF , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) -1 , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 , Ki67 . IV . To correlate baseline change p-ERK level tumor response . V. To determine pazopanib steady-state trough plasma concentration ( Css , min ) relationships Css , min PD effect toxicity pazopanib . VI . To examine association common polymorphisms CYP1A2 , CYP2C8 , UGT1A1 , ABCB1 , ABCG2 PK PD pazopanib . VII . To Assess Progression Free Survival . VIII . To Assess Overall Survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor tissue biopsy baseline blood sample collection baseline day 14 , 28 , 42 research study . Tumor tissue sample analyze DNA sequencing , ELISA , western blotting , immunoperoxidase staining . Blood sample analyze pharmacodynamics , pharmacokinetics , pharmacogenetics high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
