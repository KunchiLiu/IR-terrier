	<brief_summary>In propose study , investigator plan establish burden early onset ( EO ) neonatal sepsis newborn population bear Maela Refugee Camp two year period . Aims 1 . Define contribution Group B streptococcus ( GBS ) problem establishing : - The prevalence maternal GBS carriage - The prevalence culture positive culture negative EO GBS sepsis - The perinatal risk factor EO GBS case 2 . Through data assess potential intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis use different strategy reduce burden neonatal sepsis set 3 . To define serotypes antibiotic susceptibility profile carry invasive GBS strain 4 . To evaluate prevalence serum antibody common GBS capsular serotypes pregnant woman population , influence carriage serotype ( ST ) -specific antibody ST-specific antibody concentration mother case confirm clinical GBS disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neonatal Sepsis GBS Carriage Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Globally 4 million neonate die year , common cause death sepsis . Causes neonatal sepsis low middle income country report differ developed world . Gram negative organism think common . Despite group B streptococcus ( GBS ) carriage rate apparently similar develop world , GBS sepsis rarely report develop country : hypothesis GBS recognize neonatal pathogen develop world . There many possible explanation GBS infection may report include wide , less discriminate use antibiotic period onset labour inadequate microbiological diagnostic service . The propose study , conduct Maela Refugee Camp Thailand , two component , prospective descriptive cohort study run concurrently : 1 . Contribution GBS early onset neonatal sepsis Maela refugee camp 2 . GBS carriage , seroepidemiology GBS antibody study . Infants neonatal sepsis identify clinically . They assess , informed consent take mother , full septic screen include complete blood count , serum C-reactive protein , blood culture , lumbar puncture deep swab take ear canal . If ear swab positive GBS , blood culture negative pathogen , presumptive diagnosis EO GBS sepsis make . The mother 5ml blood sample GBS serotype-specific antibody test vaginal rectal swab obtain ( perform already ) . Women consent take part GBS carriage study , labour , low vaginal rectal swab take process use CDC Group B streptococcus guideline . Additionally , GBS-specific PCR swab use identify culture-negative case GBS carriage . 5ml venous blood take mother 5ml blood take , delivery , placenta ( umbilical vein ) GBS antibody study . This study establish burden clinical early onset neonatal sepsis population . Additionally study establish prevalence maternal GBS carriage assess potential intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis reduce burden neonatal sepsis setting . It also define serotypes antibiotic susceptibility profile carry invasive GBS strain .</detailed_description>
