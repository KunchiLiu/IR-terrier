	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether 4 week dose senicapoc alleviates exercise induce asthma symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Efficacy Oral Senicapoc Administration Exercise-induced Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based unmet medical need new agent treatment asthma role KCa3.1 function several different cell type involve inflammatory response , effect see animal model allergic asthma , reasonable explore utility senicapoc , KCa3.1 blocker , novel treatment asthma . This study test ability senicapoc alleviate bronchospasm induce exercise challenge subject asthma . Exercise challenge study conduct many currently approve asthma medication . Exercise challenge study provide control environment test condition investigate potential usefulness novel study drug treatment asthma . This study first test ability senicapoc reduce airway bronchospasm exercise challenge , one clinically important manifestation asthma see patient . In summary , demonstrate safety profile across wide range dos human efficacy animal model allergic bronchospasm hyper-responsiveness , initiation exploratory study senicapoc treatment asthma justify .</detailed_description>
