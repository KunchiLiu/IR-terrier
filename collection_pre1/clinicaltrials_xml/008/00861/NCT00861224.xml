	<detailed_description>This study perform conjunction phase 3 treatment study ( 20030105 20030212 ) open label extension study ( 20030213 ) . Subjects screen participation phase 3 study ask consider participation bone marrow study . At least 10 subject two phase 3 study ( 20030105 20030212 ) enroll study . This ensure enrollment subject non-splenectomized splenectomized . All subject participate must bone marrow biopsy within one year prior enrollment , must release tissue block Amgen interpretation central pathology laboratory . Subjects historical bone marrow within one year ( available tissue block ) must baseline bone marrow biopsy aspirate perform prior dose AMG 531 . Subjects assign follow-up bone marrow biopsy aspirate either 9 month 6 month treatment . The subject assign follow-up time descend order , first 5 subject study assign 9 month follow-up , last 5 subject study assign 6 month follow-up . Some subject follow-up bone marrow biopsy aspirate open label extension study ( 20030213 ) . To eliminate possibility perform bone marrow biopsy aspirate placebo subject , subject assign 6 month follow-up unblinded end phase 3 study treatment period ( week 26 ) . If subject AMG 531 , must follow-up bone marrow biopsy aspirate within one week ( week 27 ) . If subject placebo , follow-up bone marrow perform 3 month treatment open label study . The subject assign 9 month follow-up platelet count monitor required phase 3 protocol . Any subject platelet count &gt; 50 x 109/L week 26 phase 3 study , require schedule bone marrow biopsy aspirate week 27 . If platelet count still &gt; 50 x 109/L week 27 , bone marrow biopsy aspirate time . If platelet count drop â‰¤ 50 x 109/L prior week 27 , follow-up bone marrow biopsy aspirate perform complete 3 month treatment open label study ( 20030213 ) . Subjects discontinue AMG 531 treatment follow-up bone marrow biopsy aspirate time discontinuation , regardless pre-assigned date follow-up . If subject require bone marrow biopsy aspirate part safety assessment , assessment count follow-up bone marrow biopsy regardless time assessment . Any additional clinically warrant bone marrow biopsy also send central pathology lab review . All bone marrow biopsy report provide central lab end study , available clinical management time sample collect . All bone marrow biopsy evaluate central pathology lab .</detailed_description>
