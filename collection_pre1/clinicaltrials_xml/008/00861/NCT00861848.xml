	<brief_summary>The present study design : 1. investigate safety efficacy Real time myocardial echocardiography ( RT-MCE ) adolescents adults age 13-40 congenital acquire congenital heart disease 2. compare RT-MCE dobutamine stress perfusion MR determination coronary flow reserve ventricular wall motion 3. assess regional myocardial mechanic use myocardial speckle track MR tagging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals identify cardiology database consent routine follow visit . Exercise stress , transthoracic echocardiography cardiac MR part standard medical care follow evaluation adolescent adult repair congenital heart disease . The use contrast ( transthoracic echocardiography ) dobutamine stress test ( cardiac MR ) perform part research study . After sign consent/ assent , study subject pertinent medical history ( e.g . past palliation operative repair date type , current medication , review system ) physical exam finding extract medical record , especially record recent clinic visit . If subject female child bear age , serum pregnancy test do time . This data record use standardized case report form history physical exam . The study patient complete standardize interview determine exercise tolerance accord New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) classification . All patient consent additional testing require additional 1 hour time regular Echo CMR test . Each patient protocol supine bicycle stress contrast echocardiogram perform UNMC Echo lab.. The study subject clinically indicate CMR study ( Philips Achieva 1.5T magnet ) , schedule perform qualified CMR technologist , work pediatric adult cardiologist . An attempt make CMR Echo perform day minimize physiologic variability , least do within 1 week . Further post-processing ( wall motion analysis , speckle track myocardial tagging ) image analysis perform principal investigator standard workstation .</detailed_description>
