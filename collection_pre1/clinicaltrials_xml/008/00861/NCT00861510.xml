	<brief_summary>Background : - Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , multiple myeloma ( MM ) , lymphoid malignancy incurable lymphoid malignancy mainly affect person late 60 early 70 . Conventional chemotherapy achieve high rate clinical response , relapse follow response almost universal . Patients lymphoid malignancy relapse tumor cell become resistant chemotherapy ; therefore , new type drug need well treatment response . - The investigational drug ON 01910.Na show active MCL CLL cell , research need determine safe effective dose drug . Objectives : - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( high dose cause unacceptable side effect ) ON 01910.Na patient cancer lymphoid cell . - To study effect ON 01910.Na cancer lymphoid cell . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old diagnose cancer lymphoid cell , able take benefit exist treatment option . Design : - Evaluations treatment period : - Full medical history physical examination , pregnancy test woman . - Blood urine test . - Disease evaluation computerize tomography ( CT ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , electrocardiogram ; bone marrow lymph node biopsy ; skeletal x-ray , clinically indicate . - Treatment ON 01910.Na : - Different research subject receive increase dos ON 01910.Na determine dose consider safe . - To reduce risk one rare serious side effect treatment myeloid malignancy , patient take allopurinol 12 hour 7 day drug infusion , one 300 mg pill day . - Cycles 1 2 : Patients admit clinical center 2 day begin cycle . Each cycle involve intravenous infusion ON 01910.Na continuously period 48 hour , follow 12 day observation . Researchers try maintain schedule 2 day infusion every 14 day , interval dos may extend patient experience delay recovery blood count . - Cycles 3 4 : Patients well choose continue may receive additional two cycle ( 2 day inpatient infusion follow 12 day outpatient observation ) . At end cycle 4 , researcher determine disease respond therapy . Patients experience side effect may continue take ON 01910.Na low dose may stop receive drug . - Patients respond well four cycle ON 01910.Na may eligible additional cycle ON 01910.Na . - Patients need start another medication treat disease stop take ON 01910.Na , researcher perform final study visit 2 week last dose ON 01910.Na . After , participation study complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Safety Activity Escalating Doses ON 01910.Na Patients With Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma , Multiple Myeloma , Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Related Lymphoid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , multiple myeloma ( MM ) relate lymphoid malignancy include protocol incurable lymphoid malignancy mainly affect person late 60 early 70 . Conventional chemotherapy effective achieving high rate clinical response , relapse follow response almost universal . Response rate relapse set inferior due acquire resistance tumor cell , new therapy novel mechanisms action need . Our aim study specifically address need patient effective treatment available . Patients lymphoid malignancy relapse due acquire resistance tumor cell chemotherapy agent innovative targeted therapy overcome mechanism resistance need . One investigational drug , ON 01910.Na , potent selective inhibitor cell cycle lead reduction cyclin D1 expression . In vitro , ON01910.Na show activity CLL MCL cell line resultant cellular death . The overexpression cyclin D1 relate lymphoid malignancy provide rationale use select patient condition . We therefore propose non-randomized , pilot , dose-escalating Phase I study ON 01910.Na patient MCL , CLL , MM relate lymphoid malignancy relapse refractory standard therapy . The primary objective determine toxicity profile ( include maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose ) ON 01910.Na administer first 2 ( amend later 3 ) day 2-week cycle escalate dos patient MCL , CLL , MM relate lymphoid malignancy . The first cohort dose 1200mg/m2/day time 2 day . The second cohort dose 1500mg/m2/day 2 day . Three subject enrol third cohort 1800mg/m2/day time 2 day . One subject complete 1800mg/m2/ day time 2 day dose scheme . Two subject stop study drug first dose due progressive disease . The 3 subject receive 1800mg/m2/day time 2 day compose cohort 3 . New safety data drug manufacturer lead Amendment L , change dose 48 hour 72 hour . On November 18 , 2010 , IRB approve Amendment L , change dose new cohort 4 5 1800mg/day time 3 day , 2100mg/day time 3 day , respectively . Secondary objective include , biological effect ON 01910.Na ( example cyclin D1 expression ) cell-cycle pathway cell obtain blood , lymph node bone marrow , toxicity profile ON 01910.Na subsequent dose 2 cycle therapy , early indication biologic activity 4 cycle therapy , evaluation pharmacokinetics ON 01910.Na RPTD level , indication biologic activity extend access ( 4 cycle ( day 56 ) ) . The primary endpoint toxicity profile dose level day 28 ( cycle 2 day 14 ) . Secondary endpoint include reduction lymph node , quantification circulate lymphoma cell , assessment extranodal disease site , and/or measurement malignant monoclonal protein serum urine 4 cycle therapy ( day 56 ) .</detailed_description>
