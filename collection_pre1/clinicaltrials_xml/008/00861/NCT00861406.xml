	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find best dose schedule combine treatment PEG IntronÂ® ( pegylated Interferon-alfa 2b ) plus peptide vaccine ( gp100 ) may help improve immune response patient Stage II Stage III melanoma free disease . The safety tolerability drug combination also study . Researchers also want collect long-term follow-up information .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Therapy Pegylated Interferon- 2b Plus Melanoma Peptide Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Pegylated Interferon alfa-2b protein make human immune system help fight viral infection regulate cell function . Gp100 protein find melanoma cell . In laboratory study , gp100 vaccine show stimulate immune system `` recognize '' kill melanoma cell gp100 cell surface . Evaluation Immune cell response vaccine : Blood ( 3-1/2 tablespoon ) draw Weeks 4 , 7,10,13,16,19 , 22 test check response immune system vaccine , injection . These test research purpose use make decision medical care . Parts Study : There 2 part study , Induction Phase Maintenance Phase . The Induction Phase treatment first course treatment use stimulate ( `` turn '' ) immune-cell response fight cancer learn body 's response treatment . The Maintenance Phase treatment continue therapy use maintain immune-cell response help keep disease remission . Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 3 treatment group . Participant equal chance assign one group . Participants group receive dose level pegylated Interferon alfa-2b gp100 . The difference group dose schedule pegylated Interferon alfa-2b . Every week , participant give pegylated Interferon alfa-2b either clinic home , gp100 give participant every 3 week research nurse clinic . Participant show give Pegylated Interferon alfa-2b home . Pegylated Interferon alfa-2b give immediately GP-100 Peptide Vaccine injection . Participants Group 1 take pegylated Interferon alfa-2b certain dose level week 4 week ( Induction Phase ) , follow week 20 week Maintenance Phase ( drug take low dose level Induction ) . Participants Group 2 take pegylated Interferon alfa-2b certain dose level week 8 week ( Induction Phase ) , follow week 16 week Maintenance Phase ( drug take low dose level Induction ) . Participants Group 3 take pegylated Interferon alfa-2b certain dose level week 12 week ( Induction Phase ) , follow week 12 week Maintenance Phase ( drug take low dose level Induction ) . Study Treatment : Participant take pegylated Interferon alfa-2b injection skin . Participant receive gp100 injection skin every 3 week . On Week 1 , PEG-Intron give right GP-100 Peptide Vaccine injection clinic . Participant observe least 30 minute GP-100 Peptide Vaccine PEG-Intron Injections . On Weeks 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 22 ( +/- 1 day , count institutional holiday ) , GP-100 peptide give clinic . Participant observe least 30 minute GP-100 Peptide Vaccine injection . Participant give PEG-Intron within 24 hour GP-100 Peptide Vaccine injection . The injection gp100 give two separate area participant 's limb , upper arm thigh . It give area time . Length Study : Participant remain study 25 week , unless disease come remission experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Treatment Visit : At end study treatment ( approximately 3 week last injection gp100 ) , participant follow test : - Participant review general health medical problem may . - Participant physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Participant leukapheresis repeat . - Participant CT scan chest , stomach , pelvis , MRI CT scan brain . While participant study steroid allow treatment . This investigational study . Pegylated Interferon alfa-2b FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic hepatitis C. Gp100 FDA approve commercially available . At time , combination use pegylated Interferon alfa-2b plus gp100 use research purpose study . Up 30 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
