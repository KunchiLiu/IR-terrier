	<brief_title>A Phase II Study TX Regimen First-line Treatment Asian Elderly Patients With Advanced Adenocarcinoma Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 1.1 Background Lung cancer lead cause cancer-related mortality world . Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , common type lung cancer , comprise 80 % lung cancer case , five-year survival across stage 12 % . More 60 % NSCLC patient advance metastatic disease suitable curative resection diagnosis . Platinum-based chemotherapy remain cornerstone treatment patient result small statistically significant improvement survival compare supportive care alone.But regimen also associate moderate severe hematological non-hematological toxic effect majority patient . Approximately two-thirds patient diagnose non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) 65 year old , nearly 50 % 70 year old . And great 90 % elderly patient experience grade 3/4 toxicity treat platinum-based doublet..Moreover，a group patient performance status ≥2 intolerant intravenous chemotherapy . Availability effective , less toxic therapy might help extend potentially beneficial treatment great proportion elderly patient whose performance status ≥2 . 1.2 Rationale 1.2.1 Capecitabine NSCLC Capecitabine oral prodrug 5-Fu.It absorbed intestine convert 5'-deoxy-S-fluorocytidine ( 5'-DFCR ) carboxylesterase 5'-deoxy-S-fluorouridine ( 5'-DFUR ) cytidine deaminase , step take place liver . Finally , convert active metabolite , FU , thymidine phosphorylase（TP） . This occur tumor normal tissue ; however , TP find high concentration tumor tissue compare normal healthy tissue.The expression enzyme may influence effect capecitabine . Han et al examine TP expression tumor tissue sample NSCLC patient enrol previous phase II study capecitabine/docetaxel chemotherapy find patient high tumour cell thymidine phosphorylase expression show good response capecitabine base chemotherapy . The thymidylate synthase ( TS ) important target enzyme antifolate drug , 5-FU、UFT capecitabine , catalyze essential step DNA synthesis . The predictive role expression thymidylate synthase ( TS ) tumor treat antifolate drug extensively report NSCLC.In 2006 , Nakano et al perform immunohistochemical study clinical significance TS expression use 151 resected non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient postoperatively treat UFT.They find 5-year survival rate patient TS-negative tumour significantly high TS-positive tumour ( P=0.0133 ) .Miyoshi et al report oral administration UFT surgery might improve survival NSCLC patient TS level tumor tissue low , 5-year survival rate patient positive negative TS 50.0 89.5 % ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .Some research still find TS expression significantly higher squamous cell carcinoma compare adenocarcinoma mRNA level protein level . Recently，a Phase III Study Comparing Cisplatin Plus Gemcitabine With Cisplatin Plus Pemetrexed Chemotherapy-Naïve Patients With Advanced-Stage Non-Small- Cell Lung Cancer show Overall survival statistically superior cisplatin/ pemetrexed versus cisplatin/gemcitabine patient adenocarcinoma.The result remind u patient adenocarcinoma likely benefit antifolate drug . In preclinical study , examine tumor specimen TS TP expression obtain 171 Chinese NSCLC patient operate without preoperative chemotherapy radiation institute . We categorize Grades 0 1 negative , Grades 2 3 positive enzyme . As TS staining , 14.6 % ( n = 25 ) classify Grade 0 , 28.7 % ( n = 49 ) Grade 1 , 32.7 % ( n = 56 ) Grade 2 24.0 % ( n = 41 ) Grade 3 . And TP staining , 12.3 % ( n = 21 ) classify Grade 0 , 17.0 % ( n = 29 ) Grade 1 , 13.5 % ( n = 23 ) Grade 2 57.3 % ( n =98 ) Grade 3 . Although anti-tumor activity capecitabine well evaluate NSCLC , relatively high expression TP ( 70.8 % ) low expression TS ( 43.3 % ) NSCLC provide rationale use capecitabine patient tumor . 1.2.2 Erlotinib NSCLC Erlotinib novel small molecule inhibitor EGFR tyrosine kinase ( TK ) . It approve monotherapy treatment patient advance NSCLC progress follow first- second-line chemotherapy.It fairly well tolerated salient adverse effect mild moderate skin rash diarrhea . And study show adenocarcinoma histology predict good survival . Recently trial erlotinib first-line therapy elderly patient report investigator Dana-Farber Cancer Center . In 76 patient age 70 , vast majority adenocarcinoma histology , response rate 12 % median survival 11 month . 1.2.3 The synergistic interaction erlotinib capecitabine NSCLC . Giovannetti et al report erlotinib significantly reduce TS expression activity , possibly via E2F-1 reduction , detect RT-PCR western blot , combination decrease TS situ activity NSCLC cell . Furthermore , Van SS . et al find TS inhibitor ( 5-FU ) increase EGFR phosphorylation potentially favor EGFR-TKIs activity.Thus , erlotinib capecitabine may strong synergism NSCLC . Because effect treatment NSCLC , capecitabine erlotinib may compose new regimen NSCLC . Based preclinical observation confirm clinical synergistic anti-tumor activity combine capecitabine erlotinib gemzar refractory APC , previously conduct phase II study erlotinib combination capecitabine NSCLC .</detailed_description>
