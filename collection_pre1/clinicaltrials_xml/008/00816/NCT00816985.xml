	<criteria>Patient selection involve identify woman undergone breast cancer surgery past demonstrate lymphedema ( stage 2 3 ) base arm measurement minimum 4 different point along affected arm . Those woman mild severe lymphedema sign active infection candidate procedure . History previous nonsurgical treatment lymphedema preclude entry trial . All patient must free active disease recurrence study entry . If lymphedema recent onset , womans medical oncologist primary care physician must rule underlie cancer recurrence blood clot . Prior therapy include Manuel Lymph Drainage ( MLD ) similar massage method , use compression sleeve , pneumatic pump allowable may ongoing study entry . Prior surgical procedure treat lymphedema join lymph channel blood vessel prior time eligible study . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % . Life expectancy great one year Patients must normal organ marrow function define : 1. leukocyte ≥3,000/MicroL 2. absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/MicroL 3. platelet ≥100,000/MicroL 4. total bilirubin within normal institutional limit 5. aspartic transaminase ( AST ) /alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal 6. creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m² patient creatinine level institutional normal . Able tolerate general anesthesia recent cardiac history myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , atrial fibrillation , angina Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis . History allergic reaction compression sleeve , lymphedema bandage , general anesthetic , antibiotic Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Pregnant woman exclude study : General Anesthesia and/or invasive surgical procedure may increase risk miscarriage . Secondly , increase weight pregnancy may exacerbate lymphedema thereby make interpretation study endpoint difficult . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat invasive surgical procedure . Secondly , since elective procedure , risk surgical team needle stick would high .</criteria>
