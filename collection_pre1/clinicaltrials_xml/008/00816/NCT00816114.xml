	<brief_summary>In study investigator propose chart review Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ( CML ) patient treat outside clinical trial imatinib come MDACC second opinion . This important population patient differs management patient treat clinical trial several reason include limited : 1 . It represent large patient population receive standard-dose therapy imatinib . Estimate 200 patient evaluate fall category . 2 . The follow-up patient large trial use standard-dose imatinib ( IRIS trial , 553 patient treated imatinib ) limit first 12 month . For example , rate molecular response first 12 month therapy obtain sample stop collected time point . 3 . Patients become pregnant therapy imatinib eligible clinical trial imatinib take study . Thus , information effect imatinib imatinib pregnancy conception , several patient follow MDACC . 4 . This patient population follow therapy mostly directed local oncologist . This frequently less stringently adhere recommend guideline imatinib therapy , frequent treatment interruption , frequently use suboptimal dos imatinib ( i.e. , less 300mg daily ) . The effect treatment interruption suboptimal dose response development resistance unclear . Investigators thus plan conduct chart review patient study treatment course initial evaluation MDACC , visit MDACC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chart Review Study Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ( CML ) Patients Treated With Imatinib Outside Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PATIENT POPULATION : All patient CML phase disease ( chronic , accelerate blast phase ) receive treatment imatinib MDACC clinical trial regardless prior treatment history , least one clinic visit MDACC eligible . STUDY PLAN : The follow information collect : - Demographic information include age , gender , ethnicity , education , work history . - All laboratory value obtain MDACC institution , include CBC , blood chemistry , electrolyte , bone marrow aspiration biopsy , cytogenetic analysis , FISH , PCR . - Treatment history include start stop date , dos , treatment interruption , dose change reason dose modification . - Information toxicity include type , grade , date onset resolution , intervention manage toxicity , sequela . - Information regard pregnancy conception imatinib therapy male female patient , include date pregnancy , outcome pregnancy , intervention pregnancy , management CML pregnancy , complication pregnancy , status product , condition bear child , information lactation . This information review document receive part routine communication local oncologist study obtain MDACC . There treatment change recommendation result study . This study strictly limit review chart . Patients continue treatment recommend local oncologist treat physician MDACC . These result compare similar patient treat imatinib context clinical trial publish literature study conduct MDACC . The response rate , duration response , toxicity , dose intensity , rate transformation compare . Investigators review data July 1 , 1998 October 31 , 2008 . SAMPLE SIZE : Approximately 850 chart review .</detailed_description>
