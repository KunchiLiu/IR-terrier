	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : 1 . To determine perioperative PET/CT imaging ( consist preoperative PET/CT imaging , specimen PET/CT imaging , postoperative PET/CT imaging ) combine intraoperative use handheld gamma probe feasible surgical procedure resect malignancy . 2 . To evaluate perioperative PET/CT image assist intraoperatively localize tumor verify complete resection disease . 3 . To evaluate intraoperative detection tumor sit use handheld gamma probe preoperative injection 18F-FDG combined preoperative PET/CT imaging . 4 . To evaluate specimen PET/CT image use preoperative 18F-FDG dose detect presence tumor within specimen assess surgical margin . 5 . To evaluate specimen MRI image detect presence tumor within remnant tissue appropriately select resect specimen assess surgical margin . 6 . To evaluate standard pathology sample image guide pathology sampling ( use specimen PET/CT image ) order determine sensitivity accuracy pathologic evaluation may improve PET/CT image guidance . 7 . To compare activity surgical specimen sample well counter correlate activity pathologic finding tumor burden order determine concept previous two specific aim utilized benefit patient treat center without access PET/CT imaging equipment . OUTLINE : Patients undergo pre- postoperative fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( ^18FDG ) PET/CT image . An intraoperative handheld gamma probe use detect ^18FDG-avid tissue . Resected specimen assess ^18FDG PET image intraoperative verification complete tumor resection .</detailed_description>
