Euglycemic Insulin Clamp Muscle Biopsies . The degree insulin resistance estimate euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique ( 23 ) use insulin infusion rate ( 80 mU/m2.min ) , previously describe ( 24 ) . Briefly , one week completion screen visit 2 ( Visit 3 ) , patient report Clinical Research Unit 8:00 AM 10-12 hour overnight fast . Catheters insert peripheral vein ( infusion test substance ) retrograde hand vein ( blood sampling ) , place heat box ( 750 C ) . At time = -120 minute , percutaneous biopsy vastus lateralis muscle perform local anesthesia previously describe ( 25 ) . The subject allow rest bed 60 minute . At time = -30 min 0 min baseline blood sample obtain . At time = 0 min , insulin infuse 80 mU/m2.min 180 minute raise plasma insulin concentration approximately 120 µU/ml examine peripheral tissue ( muscle ) sensitivity insulin . During insulin clamp , small amount blood ( 0.5 ml ) withdrawn every 5 minute arterialize venous blood ( heat box technique ) determine plasma glucose concentration . When plasma glucose concentration decline 100 mg/dl variable infusion 20 % dextrose appropriately adjust maintain plasma glucose concentration constant level ( ±5 % ) . The rate exogenous glucose infusion average last 60 minute provide quantitative measure insulin-mediated ( primarily muscle ) total glucose disposal . Insulin infusion stop study terminate = 180 minute . Patients observe additional 90 minute consume meal allow leave plasma glucose stable . Vascular Studies . Subjects ask return Clinical Research Unit one week euglycemic insulin clamp vascular study ( Visit 4 ) . Change forearm blood flow follow brachial artery infusion acetylcholine ( endothelial NO-dependent ) sodium nitroprusside ( endothelial-independent ) use assess arterial vasodilatory response physiological stimulus . All test substance infuse non-dominant arm . After local skin anesthesia lidocaine , 20-gauge needle attach arterial line ( Arrow International , Erding , Germany ) use cannulate brachial artery . A pressurized 0.9 % saline solution bag connect arterial line , constant drip start = -60 min keep arterial line patent throughout study . Subjects allow rest 60 minute . At time = -5 min , five consecutive measurement forearm blood flow perform use mercury strain gauge plethysmography ( Hokanson Plethysmograph , Model EC4 , Hokanson , Bellevue , WA ) , combine rapid cuff inflator . Test substance infuse accord variation original design Bergholm et al , follow . After completion baseline measurement , intra-brachial infusion sodium nitroprusside 3 microg/min start continue 12 minute ( last 6 minute use establish local vascular effect sodium nitroprusside ) . At time = 12 min , infusion rate sodium nitroprusside increase 10 microg/min infusion continue additional 6 minute . At time = 18 min , sodium nitroprusside infusion stop 2 ml blood withdrawn clear arterial line . Saline infuse 30 minute time = 48 min , intra-brachial infusion acetylcholine constant rate 15 microg/min start continue 8 minute ( last 6 minute use establish local vascular effect acetylcholine ) . At time = 54 min , infusion rate acetylcholine double 30 microg/min infusion continue additional 6 minute . Forearm blood flow measure five consecutive time last 3 minute intra-brachial infusion period , i.e. , time = 9-12 min = 15-18 min , respectively low high nitroprusside dose , time = 51-54 min = 57-60 min , respectively low high acetylcholine dose . At time t= 60 min , acetylcholine infusion stop study terminate . At end experiment arterial line remove compression area apply 10 minute . The radial pulse verify every 5 minute 30-min period experiment terminate , subject allow leave . Subjects contact within 24 hr 1week completion study ascertain complication . Upon completion baseline metabolic vascular study patient start pioglitazone , 30 mg per day ( Visit 6 ) . Patients ask continue previous medical regimen follow PI/nursing team Texas Diabetes Institute . All participant contact weekly phone ascertain adverse event initiation period 4 week , time dose pioglitazone increase 45 mg per day . All patient require return office visit 6 week interval entire 6 month study ( Visits 7-10 ) . All available record capillary blood glucose , adverse event major event collect add confidential file patient ' assign number . Office visit every six week intend review patient ' interim medical history document adverse event , emphasize adherence medical regimen , obtain blood laboratory determination , record vital sign , body weight , neurologic fundoscopic finding . Blood urine measurement similar Visit 2 also obtain . Metabolic vascular study similar described ( Visits 3,4,5 ) initiation pioglitazone therapy perform 3 6 month ( Visits 8 10 ) insulin clamp muscle biopsy repeat end 6 month period ( Visit 10 ) . Patients discontinue study program follow reason : 1 ) principal investigator decides subject withdrawn , either serious adverse event clinically significant laboratory abnormality ; 2 ) subject request he/she withdrawn ; 3 ) subject become pregnant study ; 4 ) subject non-compliant study guideline , recommendation , treatment regimen . Early termination time accompany collection data outline Visit 10 . Any patient withdrawn study follow long necessary establish stable therapeutic program . Laboratory Tests . Measurements fast plasma glucose ( Beckman Glucose Analyzer ) , HbA1c ( 32 ) insulin ( 33 ) C-peptide ( 34 ) radioimmunoassay , free fatty acid HPLC ( 35 ) perform principal investigator 's laboratory Texas Diabetes Institute , previously describe . Assays VCAM ICAM ( 3 ) , p-Selectin s-Selectin ( 4 ) , PAI-1 endothelin-1 ( 36 ) , plasma lipid MRS ( 37 ) apolipoproteins ( 38 ) perform laboratory Diabetes Division University Texas Health Science Center . Measurements IRS-1 thyrosine phosphorylation , PI-3 kinase activity association PI-3 kinase IRS-1 also perform Diabetes Division laboratory . Sample Size Data Analysis Methods . We perform correlation analysis examine relationship increment skin forearm blood flow follow acetylcholine infusion improvement plasma hemoglobin A1c level whole body insulin sensitivity pioglitazone therapy use ANOVA repeat measure time . We anticipate pioglitazone treatment improve glycemic control tissue insulin sensitivity improvement hemoglobin A1c insulin action closely related improvement acetylcholine-stimulated increment skin forearm blood flow . Changes insulin sensitivity ( insulin clamp data ) , insulin signal pathways activity , nitric oxide production vivo , endothelial function , FPG HbA1c compare . Further , anticipate plasma level endothelial damage marker ( ICAM/VCAM ) , p-Selectin , s-Selectin PAI-1 inflammatory marker ( C-reactive protein interleukin ) , elevate diabetic patient , reduce follow pioglitazone , reduction correlate improvement skin muscle endothelial function . We also expect observe improvement plasma lipid profile , especially triglycerides free fatty acid pioglitazone treatment . Similar correlation improve endothelial-independent blood flow ( nitroprusside-stimulated ) follow pioglitazone treatment enhance insulin sensitivity , glycemic control , nitric oxide production insulin signal pathway also perform . We expect improved insulin sensitivity ( insulin clamp ) increase NO production vivo follow pioglitazone treatment closely related enhance IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation total IRS-1 associate PI-3 kinase activity , previously show markedly impaired type 2 diabetic individual ( 39 ) . In contrast , expect MAP-kinase ( mitogenic ) pathway , regulate vascular smooth muscle cell growth/proliferation show normal upregulated type 2 diabetic , may inhibit follow pioglitazone treatment . It would great pathogenic significance reduction MAP kinase activity correlate improved endothelial function follow pioglitazone therapy . The sample size calculation base upon change forearm blood flow response acetylcholine sodium nitroprusside normal diabetic subject preliminary study previously publish study Caballero et al ( 10 ) . The pooled standard deviation change baseline endpoint forearm blood flow ( ml/100gr per min ) laboratory 1.20 . In order detect 90 % power difference forearm blood flow response physiologic agent 6 month pioglitazone therapy , 40 complete patient require . Assuming dropout rate approximately 20 % , 50 diabetic patient must recruit obtain 40 completers . Based laser Doppler skin blood flow measurement , 80 % chance show improvement ~50 % skin blood response physiologic stimulus ( 65 % 100 % ) follow pioglitazone therapy . Thus , sufficient diabetic individual detect statistically significant change skin muscle blood flow .</detailed_description>
