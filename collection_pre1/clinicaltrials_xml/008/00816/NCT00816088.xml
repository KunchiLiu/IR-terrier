	<brief_summary>Fungal infection cause Aspergillus fumigatus identify 45 % patient die haematological malignancy . There significant increase death IA last 20 year . Our current diagnostic approach neither sensitive specific . The purpose study prospectively ass value current diagnostic tool , well test new diagnostic method diagnosis IA among haemato-oncology patient undergo chemotherapy stem cell transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The basis diagnosis invasive aspergillosis usually base radiological appearance , neither sensitive specific . The burden problem also properly document paucity prospective data literature . Therefore , want prospectively collect complete epidemiological data patient . In addition want collaborate radiological , respiratory , microbiological colleague develop unified approach diagnosis . In initial 12−18 month study adult haemato−oncology patient likely render neutropenic treatment enrol . All clinical data collect include dose , duration , side−effects anti−fungals administer . We evaluate accept diagnostic modality IA include determination optimum cut−offs galactomannan B−D−glucan serum urine cohort . In addition would investigate utility approach diagnosis IA marker tissue injury cytokine profiling . We would test urine parallel blood galactomannan B−D glucan ass usefulness respect blood . CT scan form important cornerstone diagnostic workup currently . However , paucity data natural history spectrum CT change neutropenic patient IA . Thus , aim carefully document change cohort . We aim rationalise CT image follow way : 1 . Baseline CT : We aim perform initial non−contrast enhance thin−section continuous volume acquisition thoracic CT study study patient . This allow u establish `` baseline '' normality addition potentially identify patient pre−existing indeterminate pulmonary lesion prior chemotherapy stem−cell transplantation . 2 . Diagnostic CT : Neutropaenic patient febrile episode unresponsive standard second−line broad−spectrum antibiotic combination ( currently meropenem vancomycin ) refer contrast−enhanced thin section continuous volume CT scan . The purpose CT study primarily support clinical suspicion diagnosis IA determine morphological extent . The purpose contrast injection test hypothesis patient IA , region necrotic lung ( contrast `` inflammatory '' infective lesion ) demonstrate contrast enhancement . 3 . Follow−up CTs ( x2 ) : In patient CT feature IA Diagnostic CT ( see No . 2 ) commence antifungal chemotherapy , two follow−up , low−dose CTs ( without iv contrast ) perform 10 day 4 week diagnostic CT . These CT study allow u evaluate serial change CT also determine potential relationship initial CT feature , haematological factor outcome . To increase diagnostic yield , patient refer lung biopsy , undergo technique preoperative `` labeling '' : small indeterminate lung nodule frequently invisible impalpable . There encouraging literature indicate preoperative label lung lesion small ( 0.3−0.5ml ) volume methylene blue act guidance track surgeon , may significantly improve diagnostic yield surgical ( open video−assisted thoracoscopic ) biopsy . Transplant patient typically would 2−4 cycle chemotherapy prior admission transplant . As chance develop neutropenic infection IA . Therefore would perform baseline bronchoscopy washing ( BAL ) ass cytokine profile admission ensure infection apparent initiation transplant conditioning . A small amount BAL sample would freeze stored future study . Additional bronchoscopy may do later admission transplant non-transplant patient clinical situation warrant accord current clinical practice . Management strategy would also assess prospectively evaluate role prophylaxis treatment . We currently use itraconazole prophylactic agent choice . Serum itraconazole level measure weekly basis patient ensure therapeutic level achieve . We conduct cost analysis .</detailed_description>
