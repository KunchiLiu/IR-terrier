	<brief_title>Standard Vs Adjusted Dosing Piperacillin/Tazobactam Acute Renal Failure Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Septic shock significant cause morbidity mortality . Early Goal Directed therapy , fluid resuscitation , use vasopressor and/or inotropes , appropriate empiric antibiotic administration remain cornerstone therapy treatment septic shock . Despite aggressive intervention , death rate septic shock North America remain high 50 percent . Septic shock define severe sepsis hypotension reverse adequate fluid resuscitation . This state distributive shock often result hypo-perfusion major organ system , include kidney , common cause multi-organ failure . Acute renal failure set septic shock often lead clinician adjust dose empiric antibiotic accord apparent renal function . Renally adjust antibiotic dosing septic shock may insufficient several reason . First , renal failure secondary hypoperfusion often reverse follow fluid resuscitation vasopressor use , lead subsequent dosing . Second , hypoperfusion state theoretically result reduction amount antibiotic deliver site infection . Lastly , drug large volume distribution prolong half life , large initial dos require quickly achieve therapeutic concentration . To date , study attempt answer important question compare standard dos renally adjust dos empiric antibiotic patient septic shock renal dysfunction initial resuscitative period . Currently uniform practice among clinician respect antibiotic dosing , reflect paucity evidence area . Some clinician currently use full dosing antibiotic set septic shock acute renal failure others adjust dose base renal function . Well design , prospective , randomize control trial urgently need clarify role antibiotic adjustment resuscitative period septic shock . The objective study determine feasibility conduct large scale randomize controlled trial compare standard renally adjust dosage antibiotic septic shock patient acute renal dysfunction . We use Tazocin prototype antibiotic study .</detailed_description>
