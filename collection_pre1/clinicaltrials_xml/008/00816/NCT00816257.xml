	<brief_summary>All patient enrol registry recipient single double lung transplantation ( bilateral sequential , heart-lung , live relate donor graft ) . During routine management lung recipient frequent surveillance lung allograft necessary . This routinely involve : measurement pulmonary function , chest radiography , collection peripheral blood ass organ function monitor therapeutic drug level , bronchoscopic evaluation allow collection lung lavage fluid lung tissue biopsy . This surveillance normally follow set schedule first one two year follow transplant procedure . Surveillance routinely perform week 2 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 52 first year follow transplant procedure . Additional surveillance may perform time clinically indicate optimal management recipient . Information specimen collect encounter enter data registry specimen repository .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Transplant Specimen Repository Data Registry Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The collection disposable lung allograft ( transplant tissue sample ) , blood sample information medical record storage , future analysis research . Stored sample available researcher obtain separate review approval ethic committee call Institutional Review Board . Immediately prior transplant surgery , surgeon pulmonologist routinely examine lung via bronchoscopy subject medicate pain . The sample obtain post-surgery ( clinically schedule ) bronchoscopies , include bronchial lavage , either send pathology discard qualify go pathology . For research , researcher ask sample qualify pathology place repository instead throw away .</detailed_description>
