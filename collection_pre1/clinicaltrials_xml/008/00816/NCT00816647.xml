	<brief_summary>The operative management chronic patellar instability controversial . Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction gain success recently might superior soft-tissue procedure . The objective prospective study compare clinical outcome medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction compare medial reef chronic patellar instability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Study Medial Patellofemoral Ligament ( MPFL ) Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many previous study medial patellofemoral ligament ( MPFL ) reconstruction patellar instability difficult interpret , either study setting include first-time recurrent dislocation , lack control group . Moreover , several study enrol patient wide age range , majority study employ retrospective nonrandomized study design . Therefore investigator design prospective , randomize study primary goal compare outcome MPFL reconstruction medial reef chronic patellar instability . The distance tibial tubercle trochlear groove measure MRI correct exceeds 17mm . Primary outcome measure occurrence recurrent objective subjective patellar instability . The second goal evaluate development articular cartilage lesion within patellofemoral joint , assess clinical score .</detailed_description>
