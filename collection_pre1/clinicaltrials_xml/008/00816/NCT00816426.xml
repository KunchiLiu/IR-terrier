	<brief_summary>This study , conduct jointly researcher National Masan TB Hospital , Asan Samsung Medical Centers Seoul , Republic Korea , Yonsei University NIH United States , examine patient tuberculosis ( TB ) develop disease hard treat case . TB infection lung usually successfully treat anti-TB drug . However , people get serious kind disease ( call multi-drug resistant TB extensively drug-resistant TB ) difficult treat may cure regular medicine available . This study try find common TB drug get place TB bacteria . It also look current anti-TB drug might use effectively well drug might develop . People 20 year age old hard-to-treat TB elect undergo surgical removal part lung National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital , Masan , Asan Medical Center , Samsung Medical Center , may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Medical history physical examination , include sputum sample . - Blood test various time study . - Drug administration . Subjects give one dose five common TB drug rifampicin , isoniazid , pyrazinamide , kanamycin moxifloxacin undergo surgery remove part lung . After surgery , lung tissue fluid around lung remove surgery examine determine region TB bacteria live analyze lung tissue . - Dynamic MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scan . This type scan us magnetic field radio wave produce picture lung . Subjects lie still table inside cylindrical scanner head soft cradle hand head . Several image obtain less 5 minute time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It take 6 24 month intensive combination therapy cure tuberculosis ( TB ) antibiotic proven activity vitro . In contrast , many pulmonary infectious disease cure follow single drug treatment similar drug one week . We hypothesize unusual complexity TB lesion degree sequestration TB bacillus within lesion may limit access drug site action , lead treatment failure , long treatment duration emergence drug resistance . To test hypothesis drug maldistribution lesion impact treatment duration failure , propose examine lesion-specific penetration property 5 standard anti-TB drug lung subject select lung surgery . The study design understand lesion type difficult penetrate . This aspect TB drug pharmacokinetics largely neglect far , probably owe lack adequate technology limited availability human TB lesion sample . Fifteen patient elect lung resection surgery ask participate study . Consented subject receive 4-5 first second line anti-TB drug concomitantly 1 5 pre-determined time prior surgery . At time resection , drug level measure plasma , uninvolved lung tissue lesion use standard analytical method well image Mass Spectrometry ( MS ) drug concentration gradient visualize across tissue section . The major aim study determine actual concentration permeability coefficient 5 study drug various lesion type contain within subject surgically remove lung tissue . Data analysis also provide relative exposure drug plasma versus lung tissue lesion . If conclusive , result may take consideration select drug dos dose regimen . Additionally , image generate standard care ( SOC ) High Resolution Computed Tomography ( HRCT ) , Dynamic MRI subject provide information regard lesion structure anatomy , lesional blood flow microvascular function . Lesion-specific correlation establish CT radiology drug pharmacokinetic ( PK ) identify histopathologic lesion type may particularly difficult sterilize evaluate potential impact drug penetration treatment outcome . The long term goal study identify factor behind poor lesion penetration , new agent optimize good penetration property target harder-to-sterilize lesion ' type .</detailed_description>
