	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy Irinotecan Bead combination intravenous chemotherapy versus intravenous chemotherapy alone treatment unresectable liver metastases patient colorectal cancer . The result study intend used support PMA application combination device</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There many treatment metastatic colorectal cancer liver , application outcome highly dependant patient disposition . Whilst resection result best long term survival , often viable treatment option . Irinotecan Bead embolization device intend treat colorectal cancer metastases liver . As adjunct , irinotecan present microspheres release controlled manner local environment tumor . Irinotecan Bead combination approve embolization device approve chemotherapy agent . The device PVA base embolization agent Biocompatibles UK Ltd , irinotecan source FDA approve supplier . Irinotecan , topoisomerase inhibitor , first systemic chemotherapy drug 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) demonstrate significant activity treatment metastatic colorectal cancer . Irinotecan approve use combination 5-FU/folinic acid patient without prior chemotherapy , second-line treatment metastatic colorectal cancer single agent patient fail establish 5-FU containing treatment regimen . The purpose combination device treatment cancer liver twofold : ( ) Nutrient oxygen starvation tumor . ( ii ) Minimization chemotherapy wash-out prolonged contact tumor tissue . Irinotecan Bead administer intra-arterially manner conventional TACE . The benefit product TACE achieve simple one-step procedure precisely embolizing artery feed tumor , ancillary action , Irinotecan Bead may release control dose irinotecan tumor bed . The potential benefit Irinotecan Bead could significant since sustainable release chemotherapy time could great effect tumor mass , optimal therapeutic efficacy Irinotecan ( S phase-specific cytotoxic drug ) generally require prolonged exposure tumor concentration exceed minimum threshold . Studies low-dose , protracted administration Irinotecan camptothecin analogue mice bear xenograft human tumor show less toxicity equal good antitumor activity shorter , intense dosing schedule . With proposed device , in-vivo pre-clinical data show reduce systemic level Irinotecan , deliver tumorous tissue follow embolization , long , sustained concentration active metabolite , SN-38 . This multicentre , open label , prospective , randomize , control phase II study design assess clinical performance chemoembolization Irinotecan Bead combination intravenous chemotherapy ( irinotecan monotherapy ) versus intravenous chemotherapy alone treatment unresectable liver metastases patient colorectal cancer previously fail first line chemotherapy . The primary endpoint Progression Free Survival measure first treatment study progression . Additional endpoint Pharmacokinetics systemic Irinotecan SN-38 ( Irinotecan Bead treatment feasibility group ) ; Tumor Response measure accord RECIST ; Local tumor response ( extent necrosis treat lesion ) ; hepatic progression free survival measure first treatment progression liver ; change tumor marker ( CEA optional CA19-9 ) ; performance status overall survival assess telephone follow-up . Safety measure assessing Adverse Events Toxicity accord NCI CTCAE v3.0 criterion . Approximately 70 patient enrol . The first 10 patient enrolled feasibility safety evaluation test arm trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients confirm diagnosis stage IV colorectal cancer unresectable liver metastasis ( primary tumor may present ) Patients least one measurable liver metastasis , size &gt; 1cm ( RECIST criterion ) Patients liver dominant disease define ≥50 % tumor body burden confine liver Patients patent main portal vein Performance status ≤ 2 ECOG Life expectancy &gt; 6 month Aged ≥18 year Patient fail ( discontinue progression toxicity ) one prior line chemotherapy metastatic disease , preferably oxaliplatinbased ( e.g . FOLFOX , CAPOX ) . Note substitution oral versus IV 5FU formulation , change 5FU schedule , discontinuations/restarting chemotherapy drug consider separate line therapy , addition `` biologics '' bevacizumab , cetuximab , panitumumab Patient previous treatment irinotecan At least 4 week since last administration last chemotherapy /or radiotherapy Hematologic function : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , platelet ≥75 x109/L , INR &lt; 1.5 ( patient therapeutic anticoagulant eligible ) Adequate liver function measure : Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dl , ALT , AST ≤5 time ULN , albumin ≥2.5g/dl , Adequate renal function ( creatinine ≤ 2.0mg/dl ) Women child bear potential fertile men require use effective contraception ( negative serum βHCG/urine test woman childbearing age ) Signed , write informed consent Patient eligible curative treatment ( i.e . resection radiofrequency ablation ) . Note : resectability define single tumor &lt; 5cm adequate liver function define : Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dl , ALT , AST ≤5 time ULN , albumin ≥2.5g/dl Contraindications irinotecan : Chronic inflammatory bowel disease and/or bowel obstruction History severe hypersensitivity reaction irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate , lactic acid excipients Camptosar Severe bone marrow failure History Gilbert Syndrome ( specific test require ) Concomitant use St John 's Wort ( Hypericum ) Active bacterial , viral fungal infection within 72 hour study entry Women pregnant breast feed Previous irinotecan base therapy metastatic disease Patients ' whose measurable disease within area liver previously subject radiotherapy Allergy contrast medium manage standard care ( e.g . steroid ) Presence another malignancy exception cervical carcinoma situ stage I basal squamous carcinoma skin Contraindicated MRI CT Patients previously treat transarterial embolization ( without chemotherapy ) Any contraindication hepatic embolization procedure : Large shunt determine investigator ( pretesting TcMMA require ) Severe atheromatosis Hepatofugal blood flow Main portal vein occlusion ( e.g . thrombus tumor ) Other significant medical surgical condition , medication treatment , would place patient undue risk , would preclude safe use chemoembolization would interfere study participation</criteria>
