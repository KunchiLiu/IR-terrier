	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate effect R-mabHDI Patients late stage , widespread stage recurrent Lymphocytic Predominant Hodgkin 's Lymphoma . The hypothesis combination R-mabHDI standard ABVD therapy patient late stage ( Stage III Stage IV ) recurrent stage Lymphocytic Predominant Hodgkin 's Lymphoma favorable outcome response progress free survival . The study also aim evaluate safety R-mabHDI . A total 1200 subject recruit study various center . Enrollment period last one half year treatment period six month . Treatment consider failure tumor size sign LPHD decrease 3 month . Subjects late stage HD , widespread HD recurrent HD fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion recruit study . Females nurse baby pregnant exclude study . All subject receive drug accord randomization process . The eligible subject randomly assign 1 2 `` treatment '' group screen . No matter group subject assign , dose drug standard dos currently use treat lymphoma . Group 1 : subject assign group 1 receive ABVD combination intravenously 1 hour day 1 15 every cycle ( every 2 week ) . Each cycle 4 week . ABVD give 6 cycle . The subject also receive R-mabHDI intravenously , separately 7 hour day 1,8,15 22 ( week ) every cycle . Each cycle 4 week . R-mabHDI give 2 cycle . Group 2 : subject assign group 2 receive ABVD combination intravenously 1 hour day 1 15 every cycle ( every 2 week ) . Each cycle 4 week . ABVD give 6 cycle .
