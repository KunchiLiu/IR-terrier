	<brief_summary>The cannabinoid type 1 ( CB1 ) receptor protein find brain involved effect marijuana ; may also play role effect alcohol dependence withdrawal . Earlier animal study show although long-term alcohol use decrease number CB1 receptor brain , number return normal alcohol use stop . This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan trace radioactive chemical call [ 11C ] MePPEP , locate measure number CB1 receptor brain . Researchers study CB1 receptor brain people alcohol dependence , compare result CB1 receptor brain people without alcohol dependence . The result study use research appropriate treatment procedure alcohol dependence . This study include 30 men alcohol dependence 50 men without alcohol dependence . All men must 18 65 year age . Participants group must medical condition prevent undergo PET MRI scan . For PET scan , participant inject small amount [ 11C ] MePPEP bring PET scanner . The scan take 3 4 hour , participant allow take break course scan . The MRI scan require injection take approximately 1 hour complete . Participants without alcohol dependence make three visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . Blood urine sample take one visit , participant arrange MRI scan one visit PET scan visit , whichever order prefer . Participants alcohol dependence undergo two PET scan : first perform 3 7 day participant last consumed alcohol , second perform approximately 2 4 week first scan ( alcohol consumption permit interval ) . Participants alcohol dependence also undergo MRI scan provide blood urine sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alcohol dependence ( alcoholism ) chronic medical illness relapse course major public health problem . Alcoholism clinically characterize period uncontrolled alcohol consumption withdrawal , counter-adaptive mechanism stress dysphoria recruit . Neurobiological research pathophysiology illness suggest primary rewarding effect ethanol well neuroadaptive change occur chronic alcohol exposure involve persistent change various brain neurotransmission system , dopamine , glutamate , gamma-amino butyric acid ( GABA ) system . Recent view illness also emphasize long-lasting recruitment brain stress system . Unfortunately , despite progress , available pharmacological agent treatment alcoholism sufficiently efficacious . The brain endocannabinoid ( EC ) system recently discover brain neurotransmission system , involve endogenous cannabinoid agent ( ECs ) act upon specific receptor ( CB1 CB2 ) . CB1 receptor abundant human brain act inhibitory modulator classical neurotransmitter . ECs CB1 receptor appear modulate brain reward system , animal study demonstrate important role CB1 receptor stimulation alcohol- drug-related behavior . During chronic alcohol exposure , EC level brain elevate CB1 receptor level consequently reduce ; appear reversible follow withdrawal . Animal study suggest CB1 receptor blockade abstinent phase may reduce alcohol crave relapse . To extent ECs CB1 receptor involve pathophysiology alcohol dependence human currently unknown . The lack suitable method reliably quantify CB1 receptor live human brain date hinder progress field . In protocol , outline study aim elucidate role CB1 receptor alcohol cannabis dependence use positron emission tomography ( PET ) recently develop radiotracer CB1 receptor , [ ( 18 ) F ] FMPEP-d2 . The aim project explore CB1 receptor abnormality various stage alcohol cannabis dependence human . For study alcohol dependence , primary hypothesis CB1 receptor downregulated chronic alcohol exposure upregulated extended abstinence . For study cannabis user , primary hypothesis CB1 receptor downregulated chronic cannabis use upregulated extended abstinence . Insight role CB1 receptor function human alcoholism chronic cannabis use may help guide future development pharmacotherapies .</detailed_description>
