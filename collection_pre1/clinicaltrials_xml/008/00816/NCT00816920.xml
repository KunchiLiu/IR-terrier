	<brief_summary>Whether isolated distal DVT ( IDDVT ) , DVT confine calf , look diagnose allow treated anticoagulant remain one still unsolved issue vascular medicine , especially insufficient data clinical risk untreated distal DVT . Management study show safe withhold anticoagulation outpatient suspect DVT compression ultrasonography ( CUS ) limit proximal deep vein yield normal result presentation repeat examination 5 7 day . This strategy base premise IDDVT need diagnose treat , necessary extend involve proximal vein . There general agreement , however , assumption non-extending IDDVT need diagnose treat , many author recommend perform single CUS examination extend distal deep vein . All available study treat anticoagulant diagnose IDDVT adequate information available risk IDDVT leave untreated . The present study , perform outpatient suspect leg DVT , aim assess clinical consequence IDDVT diagnose ( complete US investigation ) treat result investigation remain blind patient treat doctor , whereas diagnostic-therapeutic procedure remain usual one , base CUS investigation limit diagnose proximal DVT , repeat 5-7 day ( early ) exclude extension proximal vein IDDVT potentially present .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Outpatients symptomatic suspect DVT leg examine vascular doctor accord standard procedure base pre-test clinical probability ( PTCP ) assessment , D-dimer assay CUS limit proximal deep vein . Those proximal DVT exclude intermediate/high PTCP alter D-dimer level eligible study . The included patient immediately submit extensive echo-color-Doppler examination calf deep vein different vascular doctor result close envelope open three month ( necessary ) . In meantime , patient follow standard diagnostic procedure : receive appointment come back 5-7 day CUS examination , even case worsen symptoms/signs . All include patient receive telephone call three month exclude possible complication .</detailed_description>
