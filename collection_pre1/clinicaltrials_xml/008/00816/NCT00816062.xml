	<brief_title>Post-Approval Trial Talent™ Abdominal Stent Graft Treat Aortic Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System next-generation modular system endovascular repair AAA . The system design follow enhancement : suprarenal wire frame provide migration resistance , improve flexibility design treat difficult anatomy . Medtronic Vascular submit Pre-Market Application ( PMA ) FDA October 17 , 2007 , receive market approval Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System April 15th , 2008 . As condition approval , FDA request post-approval study . Medtronic therefore design post-approval study , collaboration FDA , document performance Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System market condition .</detailed_description>
