	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Early active range motion protocol open reduction internal fixation distal radius fracture volar fix angle lock plate result earlier return functional motion , early return work improve functional outcome compare delayed mobilization . Specific Aim : To compare early range motion versus delayed motion protocol distal radius fracture treat open reduction internal fixation volar fix angle lock plate respect time fracture union , range motion , functional outcome measure , return work complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>You schedule surgery broken wrist . Treatment broken bone wrist , distal radius fracture , may require different type treatment . For study type fracture treat surgery place plate screw break bone plaster splint apply . After surgery , physical therapy start . Following surgery assign one four group type wrist fracture ( broken bone ) . Each person chance ( flip coin ) put either Early Delayed Range Motion group . Those Early Range Motion group begin exercise motion start 7 day surgery . Those Delayed Range Motion , begin exercise motion start five week surgery . Once begin exercise help get back normal use wrist , measurement much motion strength wrist hand fracture . The measurement take five minute complete . All participant x-ray wrist 2 , &amp; 6 week follow surgery need appointment . At appointment ask fill four questionnaire , ask pain get along break bone wrist . The questionnaire take 20 minute time complete . At Week 26 ask record amount motion wrists paper drawing well measurement make . Working drawing take approximately five minute . At Week 52 ask two question satisfy result surgery . Surgery , x-ray wrist , exercise help get back motion broken wrist standard orthopedic practice treat broken wrist bone .</detailed_description>
