	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : A high sensitivity breast cancer detection achieve woman dense breast tissue perform review result Automated Breast Ultrasound ( ABUS ) Digital X-Ray Mammography ( XRM ) together part routine screening compare perform review result XRM alone . Primary Objective : For cohort asymptomatic woman dense breast tissue , calculate sensitivity Digital X-Ray Mammography ( XRM ) ABUS together breast cancer screen modality compare XRM alone . Secondary Objective : For cohort asymptomatic woman dense breast tissue , evaluate specificity XRM ABUS together compare XRM alone ; Calculate negative predictive value ( NPV ) positive predictive value ( PPV ) XRM ABUS . Endpoint : Breast cancer detect radiologist clinical screen setting confirm pathology . Study Design : This prospective matched-pair clinical study enrol 20,000 woman parenchymal density &gt; 50 % digital x-ray mammography ( XRM ) . Participants receive ABUS adjunct XRM . Any abnormal finding , either XRM ABUS , receive appropriate management action consistent accept medical standard care . All evaluation result , diagnosis treatment outcomes record . Participants follow one year diagnose breast cancer enrollment follow-up interval must undergo annual mammogram study completion , outcome record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Evaluate Somo•v Digital Mammography Together Breast Cancer Screening Method , Compared Digital Mammography Alone , Women With Dense Breasts .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study determine somo٠v™ ( U-Systems , Inc. ) Automated Breast Ultrasound ( ABUS ) do together routine screening mammogram , sensitive detect breast cancer woman dense breast tissue get routine screen mammogram without ABUS . Potential study volunteer recruit participate breast center cohort asymptomatic woman schedule undergo routine screening mammography . Breast cancer one commonly diagnose cancer American woman estimate 210,000 new case diagnosed 2007 . Death rate woman breast cancer much low cancer detect early stage , less intense form treatment use early stage cancerous lesion small . It reason annual routine mammogram recommend American Cancer Society woman 40 year age old current standard care breast cancer screen . One thing know interfere early detection breast cancer mammograms woman 's breast density . Women age 50 tend density breast woman old , density may present woman ages estimate exist 40 % 60 % woman mammogram . Women fibrous connective glandular tissue fatty tissue breast breast density . Breast density make breast cancer difficult radiologist see mammogram . Also , research show woman dense breast tissue likely develop breast cancer lifetime woman dense breast tissue . Automated Breast Ultrasound ( ABUS ) breast image technology less affected woman 's breast density , currently FDA approve use doctor sonographers adjunct mammography . ABUS commonly use diagnostic setting , woman know breast abnormality symptom . This study try determine ABUS clinically beneficial element routine breast screening woman know abnormality symptom , dense breast tissue could impact accuracy yearly mammogram . Unlike mammography , ABUS use radiation . ABUS use sound wave safe frequency create picture internal breast tissue . Ultrasound show find cancer visible mammography woman dense breast . The ABUS use study automatically scan breast may help detect cancer dense tissue . All woman volunteer participate study also meet study requirement receive ABUS addition routine screen mammogram . The outcome screening record follow one year . Study participation finish completion next annual routine mammogram , diagnosis breast cancer , whichever come first . More 50,000 woman invite nationwide provide inform consent screen eligibility participate . More 20,000 woman meet primary inclusion requirement &gt; 50 % dense breast tissue enrol study . Volunteers decide participate study must agree follow : 1 . To routine standard care recommend study doctor , may include diagnostic procedure like additional imaging biopsy , OR , result screen ( ABUS XRM ) negative ( normal benign ) , agree complete annual routine screen mammogram one year notify study doctor breast change symptom develop year . 2 . To contact study doctor , one study staff member , recommend follow-up procedure incomplete volunteer return clinic one year annual routine screen mammogram . 3 . To Automated Breast Ultrasound ( ABUS ) , screen mammogram indicate dense breast tissue . ABUS require patient lay comfortably back approximately 10 minute ultrasound perform . The study include many three ultrasound scan breast , scan last one minute . Unlike mammogram , ABUS involve mammography-like compression . Instead , breast lightly press patient 's body scan . If mammogram show breast tissue dense , volunteer eligible participation study undergo ABUS . The participant still receive standard care treatment would normally receive . 4 . To complete Study Participant Questionnaire allow study doctor collect follow information medical record : breast health history , cancer treatment history , mammogram result , ABUS result , result biopsy aspiration , diagnosis outcome follow-up mammogram one year later . Information , like name , date birth medical record number remove study doctor and/or clinic staff data report analyzed . Participating study take approximately 30 minute addition time participant would normally spend office . This time spend learn study , provide informed consent receive ABUS . In order study doctor gather data accuracy mammography ABUS , need collect mammography ABUS result , well result breast evaluation , procedure test perform next year , completion annual routine mammogram , result also record . There know , harmful effect breast ultrasound , although procedure may uncomfortable woman breast tender sensitive gentle pressure . If abnormality see ABUS examination mammogram , study doctor may recommend additional test , standard care might include biopsy . If potential abnormality observe ABUS see standard mammogram , participant study doctor inform testing may order result abnormal ABUS standard test would order abnormal mammogram.Other risk participate study include : 1 . Unknown risk . There may risk side effect unknown time participation study may involve additional risk currently unknown . 2 . Loss confidentiality . Just medical information routine medical care , study relate information keep confidential possible . Study information keep locked file databases password protect access . Participant name identify information release clinic use publish report study . There need share protect health information study staff clinic , absolute confidentiality guarantee . Women pregnant nursing child may take part study . Women become pregnant duration study withdrawn . There guarantee participant receive direct benefit study . There possibility ABUS may better detect early breast cancer mammogram physical examination alone . Early detection breast cancer may lead effective treatment future . This study present subject opportunity receive ABUS additional cost insurance would otherwise entitled benefit . Currently , ABUS FDA approve adjunct mammography commonly use woman know breast abnormality ; woman eligible study . Women choose participate study , woman eligible study , receive screen ABUS exam cost insurance . All study participant help u evaluate specific use FDA approve ABUS system : screening woman dense breast . If ABUS proven improve early breast cancer detection rate woman dense breast tissue , standard care breast screening may change woman dense breast tissue may receive ABUS part standard care addition screen mammography , reduce number woman die breast cancer every year . If improvement breast cancer proven , standard care change future patient doctor benefit knowledge routine screen mammography effective program early breast cancer detection . Participants reimburse time participate study receive payment participate study . The sponsor , U-Systems , Inc. , pay research study provide fund study doctor study relate procedure management study record .</detailed_description>
