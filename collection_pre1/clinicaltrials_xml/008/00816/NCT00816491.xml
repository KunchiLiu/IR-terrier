	<brief_summary>The primary endpoint study compare accuracy two procedure ( FICE target biopsy , versus conventional white light colonoscopy recommend targeted random biopsy ) endoscopic surveillance patient long-standing UC . Accuracy measure base number patient confirm neoplasia use technique . The combined histological outcome follow two procedure represent gold-standard diagnosis patient . Secondary outcome number patient false-positive finding , number neoplastic lesion detect , number false-positive lesion per patient technique total time require procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients undergo two colonoscopy , interval three month procedure . This minimum time interval choose order allow heal mucosa sample area thus prevent recognition biopsy site . The first procedure randomly allocate either conventional white light endoscopy couple targeted random biopsy high-resolution endoscopy FICE system magnification . Randomisation achieve prior first endoscopy mean sealed envelope . In recruitment centre , one two endoscopists experience endoscopic surveillance treatment ulcerative colitis assign carry first procedure . The second procedure automatically schedule second endoscopist , blind clinical histological finding first investigation . The two participate centre already endow identical endoscopic equipment . All examination perform use high resolution endoscope ( EC-590 ZW , Fujinon Inc. , Daitama , Japan ) . The zoom function device use FICE procedure . The system equip EPX 4400 processor ( Fujinon Inc. , Japan ) enable CVC technology . This digital processing system switch conventional imaging CVC imaging time procedure mean simple pushbutton endoscope . The system ten ( # 10 ) setting design select suitable wavelength . In study CVC procedure perform use set number three ( # 3 ) . The colonoscopy protocol participate centre . All patient undergo bowel preparation consist intake four litre hypertonic polyethylene glycol solution . The procedure perform conscious sedation use propofol . The caecum reach white light endoscopy case . Cecal intubation confirm identification ileocecal valve appendiceal orifice . Upon extubation , 20 mg butyl scopolamine give intravenously , bar contraindication , reduce colonic motility facilitate examination colon . When perform FICE procedure , image mode switch CVC caecum use throughout withdrawal . The endoscopist classify degree inflammation segment colon scale give Mayo Clinic score ( proctosigmoiditis - left-sided colitis - Pan Colitis ) . The quality bowel preparation note . During extubation phase , wash colon aspiration waste accomplish optimal way maximise detection capability procedure . The biopsy protocol mean reflect observe mucosal abnormality , case conventional colonoscopy , supplement random sample take every 10 cm colon . A standard biopsy forceps use ( Radial Jaw 4 , Boston Scientific Inc. , USA ) . To reduce risk sample error , minimum two biopsy suspicious lesion perform . The number lesion suspect neoplasia note targeted procedure . In case high-resolution FICE colonoscopy , analysis surface pattern perform target lesion accord pit pattern classification . Suspicious FICE lesion define polyploidy , flat irregular mucosal structure Kudo pit pattern III - V , unusual ulcer , stricture area increase disrupt vascular intensity reveal dark coloration/discoloration confirm magnification ( annexe 9 ) . In conventional endoscopy without FICE , suspicious lesion define polypoid irregular mucosa , unusual ulcer stricture . During conventional white light endoscopy ( FICE ) additional four-quadrant random biopsy take every 10 cm colon place specimen container formalin . Targeted biopsy sample send separately analysis . The histopathological evaluation perform twice , two different pathologist , participate centre . The pathologist recruit accord expertise digestive histology . For purpose study , blind assessment endoscopist analyse biopsy sample . The inflammation activity level specimen rank follow category : inflammation , mild moderate inflammation severe inflammation . Dysplasia classify accord new Vienna classification 21 . Lesions classify `` indefinite neoplasia '' differentiation adenoma colitis-associated dysplasia biopsy material consider neoplastic . The final histopathology finding compare endoscopic assessment regard presence intraepithelial neoplasia colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
