	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , pentostatin cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . It yet know whether give pentostatin cyclophosphamide together rituximab effective without bevacizumab treat patient B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study side effect give pentostatin cyclophosphamide together rituximab without bevacizumab see well work treat patient B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pentostatin , Cyclophosphamide , Rituximab With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess rate complete overall response patient B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma treat pentostatin , cyclophosphamide , rituximab without bevacizumab . - To assess proportion patient achieve negative minimal residual disease state treatment regimen . - To monitor assess adverse event regimen . Secondary - To determine molecular prognostic parameter ( ZAP-70 , CD38 , cytogenetic abnormality identify FISH , IgVH mutation status ) relate response patient . - To determine progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - To complete additional correlative study gain insight disease biology influence drug sensitivity . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord Rai risk group ( high [ Rai stage III IV ] vs low [ Rai stage 0 ] intermediate [ Rai stage I II ] ) FISH prognosis group ( favorable [ normal , +12 , 13q- , ] v unfavorable [ 17p- 11q- ] ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 course 1-5 day 1 , 22 , 43 course 6 ; rituximab IV 2-4 hour day 2 3 course 1 day 1 course 2-6 ; pentostatin IV 30 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 2 course 1 day 1 course 2-6 . Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 3 course 1 day 2 course 2-6 . Treatment repeat every 21 days* 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Course 6 56 day duration - Arm II : Patients receive rituximab IV 2-4 hour day 1 2 course 1 day 1 course 2-6 pentostatin IV 30 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1 . Patients also receive pegfilgrastim SC day 2 . Treatment repeat every 21 days* 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Course 6 56 day duration Patients undergo blood sample collection bone marrow biopsy/aspiration periodically translational research study . Samples analyze flow cytometry assessment minimal residual disease . Molecular prognostic marker ( include CD38 , ZAP-70 , IgVH gene mutation status , cytogenetic abnormality FISH ) , Tcl-1 CD49d protein expression , immunoglobulin heavy chain D J family gene usage also analyze . Plasma sample store future study evaluate level VEGF , bFGF , thrombospondin ELISA . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
