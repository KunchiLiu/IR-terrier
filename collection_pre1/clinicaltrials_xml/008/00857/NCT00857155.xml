	<brief_summary>Purpose : In patient coronary artery disease , aspirin Plavix use increasingly prevent formation blood clot coronary artery . These drug exert beneficial effect irreversibly block platelet , compound find blood responsible clot injury heart attack . However , effect also place patient increase risk bleed coronary artery bypass surgery . Therefore , currently recommend withhold Plavix therapy 5 day undergo surgery order reduce incidence bleeding . However , repeatedly show Plavix exerts variable effect different patient , may partially explain poor absorption , drug-drug interaction , variation deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) constitute gene . In addition , time require platelet regain function Plavix treatment show vary patient . Therefore , measure platelet function , may possible determine optimal amount time require withhold Plavix undergo bypass surgery , may improve rate bleed following procedure . The purpose study classify patient group base platelet function order define ideal time period delay surgery . By analyze amount time require platelet recovery , expect surgery-related bleeding decrease without increase risk blood clot formation . Eligibility : Approximately 200 patient require CABG enrol Sinai Hospital , site study conduct . To eligible must : - Be able provide write informed consent . - Be age 18-85 require CABG . - Currently aspirin therapy ( 81-325mg ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Time Based Strategy Reduce Clopidogrel Associated Bleeding Related Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : We hypothesize stratify patient clopidogrel time-based platelet function recovery group determine pre-operative clopidogrel response measure point care method result similar rate bleed compare clopidogrel naïve patient undergo elective CABG . Study design : This single center , prospective study analyze clopidogrel naïve patient patient clopidogrel background aspirin therapy require CABG .</detailed_description>
