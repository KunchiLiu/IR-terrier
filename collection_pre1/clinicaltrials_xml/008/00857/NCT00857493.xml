	<criteria>Male female subject 5670 year age . If safety concern identify upon review safety data first 30 subject enrol , age range extend 80 year . Time since current smallpox vaccination &gt; 10 year . The subject read , sign date Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) , successfully complete ( least 90 % correct [ 3 attempt allow ] ) test understand sign Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) authorization form . Women must negative serum pregnancy test screen negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hour prior vaccination . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use acceptable method contraception 30 day prior first vaccination , must agree use acceptable method contraception study must plan become pregnant least 28 day last vaccination . ( Acceptable contraception method restrict abstinence , barrier contraceptive , intrauterine contraceptive device license hormonal product ) . Weight : ≥ 100 pound ( 45.5 kg ) ≤ 330 pound ( 150 kg ) . White blood cell ≥ 2500/mm3 &lt; 11,000/mm3 . Absolute neutrophil count within normal limit . Hemoglobin within normal limit . Platelets within normal limit . Adequate renal function define : 1 . Urine protein ≤ +1 ( dip stick ) 2 . Serum creatinine within normal limit Adequate hepatic function define : 1 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) absence evidence significant liver disease . 2 . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) alkaline phosphatase ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Cardiac troponin I &lt; 2 x ULN . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) without clinically significant finding , e.g . kind atrioventricular intraventricular condition block complete left right bundle branch block , AV node block , QTc PR prolongation , sustain atrial arrhythmia , sustain ventricular arrhythmia , 2 premature ventricular contraction ( PVC ) row , ST elevation consistent ischemia . History active immunodeficiency immunosuppression cause acquired congenital disease cause treatment chronic administration ( &gt; 14 day ) systemic , i.e . parenteral oral , corticosteroid ( &gt; 5 mg prednisone [ equivalent ] per day ) , radiation immunemodifying drug . Periodic steroid injection , e.g . intraarticular , allow within 30 day prior first vaccination throughout study Visit 5 ( V5 ) . Post organ transplant subject whether receive chronic immunosuppressive therapy . Uncontrolled serious infection , i.e . respond antimicrobial therapy . History serious medical condition , opinion investigator would compromise safety subject prevent subject comply study requirement . History active autoimmune disease , e.g . Type I diabetes . Persons vitiligo thyroid disease take thyroid hormone replacement exclude . Skin cancer past six month . If treatment skin cancer successfully complete six month ago malignancy consider cure , subject may enrol . Subjects history skin cancer must vaccinate previous site cancer . Any malignancy past five year . If treatment cancer successfully complete 5 year ago malignancy consider cure , subject may enrol . Clinically significant hematological , renal , hepatic , pulmonary , central nervous , cardiovascular gastrointestinal disorder adequately control medical treatment within last 12 week vaccination judge site 's Principal Investigator . History myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure mark limitation activity due symptom , e.g . walk short distance [ 20 100 ] ( i.e . &gt; Grade II accord New York Heart Association ) , cardiomyopathy stroke transient ischemic attack past two year . Uncontrolled high blood pressure define systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg and/or ≥ diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg within last six month . Subjects active coronary heart disease manifest angina , even medication . 25 % great risk develop myocardial infarction coronary death within next 10 year use National Cholesterol Education Program 's Risk Assessment Tool : http : //hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/atpiii/calculator.asp Clinically significant mental disorder adequately control medical treatment . History chronic alcohol abuse ( 40 g/day , e.g . 3 glass beer 2 glass wine least six month ) and/or intravenous drug abuse ( within last six month ) . Subjects history substance and/or alcohol abuse also exclude opinion investigator abuse could prevent subject comply study requirement . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate IMVAMUNE® component vaccine , e.g . tris ( hydroxymethyl ) amino methane , chicken embryo fibroblast protein , aminoglycosides ( gentamycin ) . History anaphylactic shock severe allergic reaction vaccine require immediate treatment . Subjects undergoing treatment tuberculosis infection disease . Having receive vaccination plan vaccination live vaccine within 30 day prior study vaccination . Having receive vaccination plan vaccination kill vaccine within 14 day prior study vaccination . Administration plan administration immunoglobulin and/or blood product period start three month prior administration vaccine end study conclusion . Use investigational nonregistered drug vaccine study vaccine within 30 day precede first dose study vaccine plan administration drug study period . Temperature ≥ 100.4°F ( 38.0°C ) time enrollment . Any condition might interfere study objective would limit subject 's ability complete study opinion investigator . Study personnel .</criteria>
