	<brief_summary>The primary objective protocol determine brain amyloid image florbetapir F 18 ( 18F-AV-45 ) PET scan predictive progressive cognitive impairment subsequent 36 month group : normal control , mild cognitive impairment Alzheimer 's disease . Hypothesis 1 : The probability subject experience progressive cognitive impairment within 36 month image great subject whose 18F-AV-45 PET scan rat amyloid positive compare subject whose PET scan rat amyloid negative . The secondary objective determine stability , 36 month clinical diagnosis , AD patient amyloid positive 18F-AV-45 PET . Hypothesis 2 : The diagnosis AD remain unchanged patient whose PET scan rat amyloid positive .</brief_summary>
