	<brief_title>Phase III Study Correlation Between Florbetapir F18 PET Imaging Amyloid Pathology Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two primary analysis : - The first primary analysis evaluate correlation blind reader ' rating amyloid plaque density PET scan cortical amyloid plaque density autopsy . - The second primary analysis evaluate specificity blind reader ' rating presence absence amyloid plaque density PET scan For autopsy population , subject enrol various end-of-life ( e.g . hospice / hospital / nursing home ) late-life ( longitudinal study age ) population . Enrollment include subject various level cognitive status , range cognitively normal dementia . It expect amyloid plaque density elderly population range low ( normal age ) moderate ( e.g . cognitively normal subject asymptomatic amyloid deposit mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) subject intermediate level amyloid deposit ) high ( subject AD ) . The study also enroll young healthy subject presumably devoid amyloid specificity cohort . Screening assessment may take place several day include collection demographic information , diagnostic interview , safety assessment . At time screening , subject caregiver ask provide consent brain donation already enrol brain donation program affiliate study , addition provide informed consent screen imaging procedure study . Subjects qualify study catheter place intravenous ( i.v . ) administration florbetapir F 18 . Subjects receive single i.v . bolus 370 MBq ( 10 mCi ) florbetapir F 18 follow brain PET image 10 minute duration , begin approximately 50 minute post-injection . Vital sign safety lab obtain prior administration florbetapir F 18 completion image session . Adverse event continuously monitor imaging session . Subjects experience adverse event discharge event resolve stabilize .</detailed_description>
