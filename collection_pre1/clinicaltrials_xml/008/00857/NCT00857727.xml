	<brief_title>Use Dexmedetomidine Reduce Emergence Delirium Incident Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence delirium general anesthesia common problem pediatric population report incidence 80 % . In addition jarring child parent , ED cause significant physical harm , particularly surgical site . ED also associate accidental removal surgical dressing drain , intravenous intra-arterial catheter , increase nursing care , extend recovery room stay , delay reunion parent . Emergence delirium especially associate sevoflurane , commonly use inhalation anesthetic pediatrics . At present , single definition pediatric ED heterogeneous clinical presentation . It describe acute phenomenon child irritable , uncompromising , uncooperative , incoherent , inconsolably cry , moan , kick thrash . Typically , child recognize identify familiar object people , often exhibit combative behavior . Although ED self-limiting phenomenon , especially dangerous interventional neuroradiologic patient whose femoral artery catheterize must keep immobile immediate post-operative period . These patient also multiple intravenous intra-arterial catheter dislodge episode ED . Numerous pharmacologic agent include benzodiazepine , opioids , ketamine , clonidine , study prophylactic agent ED meet vary success . Promising result α-2 adrenergic agonist clonidine , spur interest new α-2 adrenergic agonist , dexmedetomidine . Dexmedetomidine highly selective 2A subtype central presynaptic α-2 adrenergic receptor associate sedation analgesia . It currently approve use adult sedative agent intensive care unit use myriad way sedation . As sedative , dexmedetomidine unusual depress respiratory drive action mediate GABA-mimetic system . The quality sedation produce dexmedetomidine unique , describe `` cooperative sedation , '' patient interact healthcare provider follow verbal command . This particular sedation profile permit patient comfortably sedate , yet cooperate accurate neurological exam . The extreme example awake craniotomy , patient undergoes neurological examination surgery . In addition sedative , dexmedetomidine also analgesic suppresses shiver , make especially useful perioperative period . There study suggest use dexmedetomidine ED yet none examine use pediatric neurosurgical population . Treatment ED pediatric neurosurgical patient involve balance need smooth emergence need accurate neurological exam . Benzodiazepines opioids currently use treat ED long-acting , interfere neurological exam , carry risk respiratory depression , nausea , vomit , acute tolerance . Dexmedetomidine provide alternative current treatment modality ED , interfere neurological exam .</detailed_description>
