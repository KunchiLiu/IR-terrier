	<detailed_description>Anaemia one main disease burden child develop country . Severe anaemia often fatal , moderate anaemia lead growth cognitive disorder . The incidence anaemia child extremely high malaria endemic area since episode clinical malaria asymptomatic parasitaemia result red cell destruction . It show Tanzania incidence severe anaemia infant reduce 30 % regular administration iron supplement , 60 % regular malaria chemoprophylaxis give addition . One way operationalise research finding , minimal additional cost government community , link distribution iron antimalarial drug EPI programme . We propose community-randomised trial study effectiveness intermittent iron supplement malaria chemotherapy reduce incidence anaemia clinical malaria , investigate possible interaction iron antimalarial drug EPI vaccine . The study two arm : child arm receive monthly supply twice weekly iron supplement attend EPI growth monitoring clinic . In addition , child arm 1 receive placebo receive Polio/DPT 2 , Polio/DPT 3 measles vaccine , arm 2 receive sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) . The baseline incidence anaemia malaria , immune response EPI vaccine , estimate sample child non-intervention area adjacent study area . The immune response EPI vaccine , drug side-effects , incidence anaemia malaria compare two arm study non-intervention area . Any possible 'rebound ' malaria incidence due impairment immunity monitor treated six month stop chemotherapy supplementation .</detailed_description>
