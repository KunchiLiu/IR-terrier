	<brief_title>A First-Time-In-Human Study Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human body naturally produce substance know opioids pleasurable ( hedonic ) response eat highly sugary fatty food increase opioids . The drug test study attache specific bind site brain , know mu-opioid receptor . This may stop natural effect opioids therefore reduce pleasurable response food . We predict turn may help patient obesity lose weight effectively . The study divide three part : Part A : This part study start low dose study drug , gradually increase subesquent dos . This know dose-rising way ass safety tolerability ( side effect make take drug unpleasant ) . Effects compare see placebo ( `` dummy '' drug ) take . Up 4 group 6-9 healthy male female volunteer enrol part study . Part B : A dose select Part A well tolerate use check difference blood level study drug take without food liquid form , without food capsule , high fat meal capsule . One group 12 healthy male female volunteer enrol part study . Part C : A well tolerate dose select Parts A &amp; B use test whether drug effect preference sugary high fat food , compare placebo . Up 32 healthy overweight male volunteer enrol part study .</detailed_description>
