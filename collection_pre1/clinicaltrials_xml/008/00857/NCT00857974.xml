	<brief_summary>The physical function old candidate renal transplantation ability sustain physical activity program currently unknown . The primary goal study determine feasibility physical activity intervention old dialysis-dependent patient , assess effect maintain transplant candidacy outcome transplantation . Clinical practice guideline set absolute age limit evaluate potential renal transplant candidate . While cardiovascular risk assessment malignancy screen emphasize old age group , physical performance risk disability often overlook . Although healthy old patient experience increase life expectancy renal transplantation versus remain dialysis , outcomes capacity live independently function well study . Given poor baseline health status age end-stage renal disease patient , rapid change health dialysis , national organ shortage , increasingly important identify factor predict good outcome devise strategy maximize benefit transplantation old individual . The investigator hypothesize muscle principal organ system underlie impaired physical function among old transplant candidate , decrease muscle mass physical function lead poorer outcome older renal transplant candidate . The investigator propose simple bedside performance measurement low extremity functional limitation , Short Physical Performance Battery , strong predictor outcome patient cohort . The investigator also propose outcome improve exercise training , potentially leading long duration active transplant candidacy great independence successful transplantation . The Specific Aims research : 1 . Determine feasibility exercise intervention dialysis-dependent wait-listed patient age 60 year randomize one two group : usual care versus structure physical activity program . 2 . Define natural history physical function patient age 60 year great remain dialysis undergo renal transplantation attempt identify subgroup old wait list patient high risk develop disability .</brief_summary>
