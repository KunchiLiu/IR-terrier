	<brief_title>Beta-Glucan Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess feasibility toxicity therapy beta-glucan MM-10-001 patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Secondary - To explore analysis effect beta-glucan MM-10-001 innate immune compartment , particular natural killer cell activation effector status . - To perform correlative ( cytokine profile ) explore effect beta-glucan MM-10-001 cytokine profile patient . - To document clinical response patient treatment beta-glucan MM-10-001 . - To explore potential beta-glucan MM-10-001 dose effect patient-reported functional status . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral beta-glucan MM-10-001 twice daily . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically correlative study . Samples analyze natural killer cell activation effector status cytokine profile flow cytometry . Patient-reported functional status assess baseline periodically treatment QOL-FACT-L questionnaire . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
