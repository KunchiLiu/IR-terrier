	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine relationship genomic variant component renin-angiotensin system development kidney problem due Calcineurin-inhibitors post liver transplant.Also investigator evaluate relationship chronic renal failure post liver transplant risk death . A sample blood urine wil examine see patient 's gene arrange order determine difference gene people may explain develop chronic renal failure receive liver transplant . The result may help u classify patient accord risk allow u target treatment individual need . In addition , may ultimately lead treatment slow prevents development chronic rejection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This study cross-sectional investigation liver transplant recipient receive liver transplant least 6 month follow-up . This study conduct Northwestern Memorial Hospital , Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation Northwestern University . Patients underwent liver transplantation least 6 month follow-up receive maintenance immunosuppression ( consist calcineurin inhibitor ( CI ) , cyclosporine ( CsA ) , tacrolimus ( Tac ) ) entire post-transplant follow-up period include analysis . For patient , follow information collect : - Date transplantation , age , gender , race , cause liver failure , past medical history include incidence hypertension , diabetes mellitus , post-operative complication , post-operative infection , number acute liver rejection episode , death , CsA Tac trough level different time point post-transplant sCr level liver transplant , 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 month , yearly post-transplant . - GFR ( Glomerular Filtration Rate ) MDRD equation liver transplant , 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 month , yearly post-transplant . - In attempt rule patient pre-existing CRF liver transplant , patient sCr &lt; 1.0mg/dL liver transplant include analysis . Genotyping : - DNA extract use blood buffy coat liver transplant recipient . - Determination ACE genotype perform use polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer ( PCR-SSP ) polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) . - Based GRF calculation MDRD equation liver transplant patient categorize three group base NKF stag chronic kidney disease : Group I- &gt; normal GFR ( &gt; 90ml/min/1.73m2 ) . Stage I CKD Group II- &gt; GFR 30-59ml/min/1.73m2 . Stage III CKD Group III- &gt; GFR 15-29ml/min/1.72m2 . Stage IV CKD - Urine ( 80cc ) collect patient 3 group analyze biomarkers interstitial fibrosis proximal tubule injury . Specific biomarkers test : urinary TGF-beta1 , kidney injury molecule-1 angiotensinogen . Urinary biomarkers normalize creatinine analyze use ELISA assay . - Blood ( 20cc ) take one visit . - An additional blood draw ( 18cc ) request subject . This blood use study organ transplant tolerance subject currently use immunosuppressant medication . Statistical Plan-Statistical test perform : Once liver transplant patient genotyped urine sample collect compare development CKD post liver transplant association urinary biomarkers polymorphisms ACE gene . Two sample test use compare difference continuous variable liver patient different degree CKD ; chi square test use compare difference discrete variable . Multivariable logistic regression analysis also perform identify combination clinical variable gene polymorphism significantly associate development post liver transplant renal dysfunction . This study enable u learn evaluate potential genetic predisposition development renal dysfunction exposure CI . If hypothesis correct , test component RAS genotype may help identify patient risk CI nephrotoxicity help pre-selection liver transplant candidate use CI primary immunosuppression avoid . Furthermore , data generate study might serve strong basis prospective NIH-founded project look role agent block renin-angiotensin system prevention CI-induced chronic nephrotoxicity .</detailed_description>
