	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treatment Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ( DCIS ) Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) breast pre-malignant lesion breast , associate marked increase likelihood develop invasive breast cancer . Since DCIS tend associated microcalcifications , detect increased frequency patient screen mammographic technique . The treatment DCIS base number parameter ; local treatment depend size lesion , grade margin . The systemic treatment currently available form endocrine therapy ; depend expression estrogen receptor ( ER ) . Randomized trial show treatment DCIS breast conserve therapy radiation effective simple mastectomy . The efficacy tamoxifen reduce incidence invasive non-invasive breast cancer establish . In addition surgery ( without radiation ) , patient ER positive disease also receive anti-estrogen therapy . Current guideline recommend additional therapy ER-negative DCIS . The rationale propose study base observation HER2 express high level higher grade DCIS , typically lack ER . In addition , inverse relationship ER expression expression EGFR also demonstrate . Lapatinib active receptor may therapeutic action ER negative DCIS . We propose treat patient drug interval biopsy diagnosis definitive surgery .</detailed_description>
