	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) disease increase global public health importance . Because emerge multi drug resistance long treatment duration need optimize current chemotherapy . Host immunity important determine susceptibility outcome disease could exemplify co infection HIV dramatically increase risk develop TB .

In previous study Gondar , Ethiopia , observe effect adjuvant treatment arginine capsule sputum smear conversion reduction cough . In study want test hypothesis base previous observation arginine rich food supplementation might enhance clinical improvement patient smear positive tuberculosis effect could due increase nitric oxide production .</detailed_description>
