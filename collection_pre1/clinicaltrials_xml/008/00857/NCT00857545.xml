	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study OPT-821 vaccine therapy see well work compare OPT-821 alone treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , peritoneal cancer decrease disappear , cancer may still body . Biological therapy , OPT-821 , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know whether OPT-821 effective without vaccine therapy treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OPT-821 With Without Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Peritoneal Cancer Second Third Complete Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine polyvalent vaccine ( include GM2-keyhole limpet hemocyanin [ KLH ] , Globo-H-KLH , Tn-mucin 1 [ MUC1 ] -32mer-KLH , Thompson Friedreich antigen [ TF ] -KLH plus OPT-821 ) decrease hazard progression death compare vaccine contain OPT-821 alone woman epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer second third complete clinical remission . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare treatment arm respect incidence toxicity . II . To determine polyvalent vaccine decrease hazard death compare vaccine contain OPT-821 alone woman epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer second third complete clinical remission . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate immune response ( enzyme link immunosorbent assay [ ELISA ] ) participant , order determine outcome correlate antigen-specific immune titer . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive polyvalent antigen-KLH conjugate vaccine immunological adjuvant OPT-821 subcutaneously ( SC ) week 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 11 , 23 , 35 , 47 , 59 , 71 , 83 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive immunological adjuvant OPT-821 SC Arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
