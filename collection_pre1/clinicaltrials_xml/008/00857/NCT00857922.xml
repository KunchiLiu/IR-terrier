	<brief_summary>In order expand neuroscience research move laboratory advance patient , need integrate reliable clinical data biologic information patient tissue specimen . The Neuroscience Research Repository ( NRR ) seek meet need . The NRR prospective database sample bank create collect information sample current future neuroscience research . The objective NRR develop data sample repository study neurological condition . A repository utilize standardize electronic health data sample collect uniform manner serf foster ability perform research current future project . Samples data clinical , genomic proteomic analysis provide optimize value neuroscience research . The NRR enroll patient collect clinically record longitudinal data long follow Neurosurgery service additional 5 year release care . Patients enrolled admission service sample take three time point : Time One , within 24 hour event ( preferably first blood draw ) ; Time Two , within 48 hour event ; Time Three , time residual tissue availability . Family member select group patient also approach enrollment . Samples data label study code maintain confidentiality . Samples data maintain secure , limited access environment back-up/redundancy procedure place . Sample inventory maintain bar-coding system . A duty warn clause include consent determination willingness re-contacted future research . Time sample acquisition time sample processing documented quality control purpose . Freezers monitor temperature stability . Recipient investigator request provide feedback sample quality . Samples distribute neuroscience investigator approval Neurosurgery Scientific Review Committee - Dissemination Review Committee Committee Protection Human Subjects ( CPHS ) .</brief_summary>
