	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Aim 1 : test benefit GMT improve executive function . Aim 2 : Investigate factor affect response treatment . RESEARCH PLAN : This randomize control study investigate effect Goal Management Training ( GMT ) blast-related mTBI . The control group participate Brain Health Workshop ( BHW ; Levine 2011 ) , develop specifically consistency GMT session length contact facilitator ( Levine , 2011 ) . Study outcome measure collect pre- post-treatment , 1 month end treatment . Family Member/Friend Participant . The participant identify friend family member observe his/her everyday behavior least 2-3 hour , twice week . After obtain consent person , participant his/her friend family member ( ) attend general education session brain function treatment . In addition attend education session consent friend family member answer questionnaire ( BRIEF-A ) participant 's executive function . The friend family member also receive phone call weekly order report participant 's ease difficulty complete homework . METHODS : The investigator enroll 54 participant , recruit North Florida/South Georgia Veteran Health System Gainesville . Clinical staff inform outpatient study . Patients interested hear research study provide contact information study staff . A meeting schedule candidate screen . Participants randomly assign either treatment control group , ratio 38:16 . In addition , Pocock-Simon covariate adaptive randomization procedure use , PTSD severity category within two site , approximately 70 % ( 38/54 ) subject assign treatment group ; consequently , approximately equal proportion PTSD subject assign treatment control group within two study site . Simulated Practice In The Laboratory : Training task include exercise : 1 ) clapping word inhibit clapping target word ; 2 ) card sort ; 3 ) decision make plan order complete five activity within four minute time span ; 4 ) Catalog Task ; 5 ) Book keep task . Initially , exercise relatively easy subsequently progress great complexity . Participant 's strengths weakness discuss . Improvements identify reinforce learn efficient planning problem solve . The following step taught simulate task : 1 ) Identify Main Goal ; 2 ) Break task sub-goals step goal ; 3 ) List supply need ; 4 ) Recognize potential barrier complete goal ; 5 ) Determine strategy accomplish task : 6 ) Prepare begin task `` presence mind '' exercise ; 7 ) State goal loud ; 8 ) Begin task stop self frequently state main goal loud check sure one work toward goal ( target ) . Functional Practice Home Smartphone Technology : In addition lab practice , original GMT ( Levine , 2000 ) include three task must practice home . Participants identify complex task difficulty , example , meal planning shopping ; plan party ; building birdhouse ; pay monthly bill . Generalization laboratory practice home environment critical importance . Unfortunately , original GMT provide method monitor frequency success home practice , method support productive practice home environment . In prior work , investigator develop The Veteran 's Task Manager ( A Smartphone application ( AP ) . Participants use AP feature break task , estimate time complete , check step complete , respond visual/vibrating alert `` Goal '' respond alert `` On Target '' . Information collect AP , accuracy planned step , time complete task , number distraction goal . The AP record participant 's performance functional practice home information review next lab session . Control Group Intervention . The Brain Health Workshop ( BHW ; Levine 2011 ) develop specifically consistency GMT session length contact facilitator ( Levine , 2011 ) . BHW education presentation brain function cognitive principle learn . Information stress reduction , sleep hygiene , energy management , exercise communication cover homework quizzes information cover . FINDINGS : Initial report</detailed_description>
