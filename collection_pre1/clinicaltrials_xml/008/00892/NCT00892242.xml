	<brief_title>Perioperative Treatment With Zoledronic Acid Patients With Resectable Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer pancreas carry ominous prognosis . The five-year overall survival rate malignancy le 5 % . Chemotherapy gemcitabine carry response rate approximately 25 % . Resection offer potential cure ; however , even resection , great majority patient die metastatic disease . Substantial improvement need treatment malignancy . Patients disease process clearly develop tolerance pancreatic tumor . This evidence increased number activity immunosuppressive cell include MDSC Treg patient pancreas cancer . An intervention inhibit population MDSC Treg may highly useful treatment disease process . A novel treatment pancreas cancer , setting , would deplete circulate tumor-associated immunosuppressive cell prior resection . This would facilitate host mount great immune response tumor . The eventual goal would combine neoadjuvant zoledronic acid gemcitabine , another agent synergizes zoledronic acid target MDSC . When combined current adjuvant chemoradiation , use zoledronic acid neoadjuvant adjuvant setting , hop patient could mount great immune response lead increase overall survival prevention local disease distant metastasis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must newly diagnose , histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis pancreatic adenocarcinoma . The histological slide block must available review . Patient must resectable disease candidate surgical treatment . Recent CT scan demonstrate pancreatic tumor , evidence distant disease , contraindication resection . Patients must ≥ 18 year old . Performance Status : Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 Life Expectancy &gt; 12 week . No previous history chemotherapy pancreas cancer prior start protocol treatment . Patients must recover uncontrolled , intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris cardiac arrhythmia . Patients must adequate bone marrow function define absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl . Patients must normal renal function define serum creatinine ≤ 1.3 mg/dl creatinine clearance ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 serum creatinine &gt; 1.3 mg/dl . Patients must adequate hepatic function total bilirubin &lt; 5.0 mg/dl AST ≤ 3x institutional normal value . Patient must prior current active autoimmune disease require management immunosuppression . This include inflammatory bowel disease , systemic vasculitis , scleroderma , psoriasis , hemolytic anemia , immunemediated thrombocytopenia , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjogren 's syndrome , sarcoidosis rheumatologic disease . Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require daily systemic corticosteroid acceptable . The patient previous history malignancy eligible study patient meet follow criterion cancer survivor : ( ) patient undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy ; ( ii ) patient consider disease free least 5 year ; ( iii ) adequately treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer . For sexually active patient , use adequate barrier contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) require therapy , prior study entry duration study participation . Nonpregnant status determine woman childbearing potential . After informed treatment involve , patient ( legally authorize representative ) must give write consent . Patient currently receive investigational agent . Pregnant nursing woman patient eligible . Patients know HIV positive ineligible potential inability modulate immune response ( patient selfreport ) . Patients treat bisphosphonatebased therapeutic indication , previous year . Patients recent ( within 6 week ) plan dental jaw surgery dental jaw surgery ( e.g . extraction , implant ) . Current active dental problem include infection teeth jawbone ( maxilla mandibular ) ; dental fixture trauma , current prior diagnosis osteonecrosis jaw ( ONJ ) , expose bone mouth , slow healing dental procedure . Patients history aspirin sensitive asthma .</criteria>
