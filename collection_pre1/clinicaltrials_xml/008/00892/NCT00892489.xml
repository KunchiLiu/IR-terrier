	<brief_title>A Bioequivalence Study 15 mg ER OROS Paliperidone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design single-center , open-label , randomize , 3 treatment-period , crossover study healthy male adult . The study consist screen phase open-label treatment phase volunteer receive 3 treatment study drug random order separate washout period 10 14 day . Treatment A consists single oral dose 15 mg ER OROS paliperidone Phase 3 formulation fast state ; Treatment B consist single oral dose 15 mg ER OROS paliperidone to-be-marketed formulation fast state ; Treatment C consist single oral dose 15 mg ER OROS paliperidone to-be-marketed formulation consumption high-fat breakfast . There slight formulation difference ER OROS paliperidone formulation use Phase 3 efficacy study formulation intend market . What important , however , high tablet strength use Phase 3 tablet strength plan market commercial formulation different . For Phase 3 study , 9 mg high tablet strength high dose 15 mg administer 2 tablet 3 mg 1 tablet 9 mg . The high to-be-marketed tablet strength 15 mg . This study design demonstrate bioequivalence Phase 3 formulation high tablet strength to-be-marketed formulation ass effect food high to-be-marketed tablet strength . Safety tolerability monitor throughout study . All volunteer receive follow 3 treatment order specify random assignment : Treatment A , oral ER OROS paliperidone Phase 3 formulation 2 tablet 3 mg 1 tablet 9 mg fast state ; Treatment B , oral ER OROS paliperidone to-be-marketed formulation 1 tablet 15 mg fast state ; Treatment C , oral ER OROS paliperidone to-be-marketed formulation 1 tablet 15 mg high-fat breakfast .</detailed_description>
