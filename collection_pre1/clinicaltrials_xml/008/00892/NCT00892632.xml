	<brief_title>Confocal Endomicroscopy Biliary Strictures -Phase I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite recent advance biliary image biliary tissue acquisition , diagnosis tissue-confirmation suspect malignant biliary obstruction remain challenge . Patients often undergo repeat endoscopic cross sectional imaging procedure , even surgical exploration establish diagnosis . A major new advancement cancer image development probe-based confocal endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) system capable cellular sub-cellular imaging biliary tree . Preliminary data suggest pCLE accurately detect exclude malignancy within otherwise indeterminate stricture . In study , propose validate preliminary finding compare two method pCLE image acquisition important clinical translation technology . This Phase 1 Study : During study , vivo microscopic image 10 benign ( post-operative know benign disease orthotopic liver transplant ) 10 malignant ( cytology-positive ) stricture obtain ERCP . Patients clinical course follow composite gold standard use comparison pCLE . These confocal image biliary lesion review side side , unblinded reference standard endoscopists . The basic image characteristic allow distinction benign malignant tissue establish ( detail feature note examine ) . We also assess whether good quality image feasibly obtain without cholangioscopic guidance .</detailed_description>
