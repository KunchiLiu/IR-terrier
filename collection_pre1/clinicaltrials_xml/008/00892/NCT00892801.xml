	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving everolimus together whole-brain radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose everolimus see well work give together whole-brain radiation therapy treat patient brain metastasis non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase I intend determine maximum tolerate dose . Study drug administer orally , day , 15 day , one day prior initiation WBRT 5 10 mg/day phase I component . One dose select maximum tolerable dose select phase II component . OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum-tolerated dose everolimus combine concurrently whole-brain radiotherapy patient brain metastasis stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . ( Phase I ) - To evaluate median survival patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) Secondary - To assess response rate patient . ( Phase II ) - To assess safety tolerability regimen patient . ( Phase II ) - To determine time CNS ( neurological ) progression , confirm MRI , patient . ( Phase II ) - To determine time systemic ( non-CNS ) progression patient . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study everolimus . Patients undergo 10 fraction whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) begin day 0 , 5 day per week , receive oral everolimus daily day -1 13 . Beginning 2 week completion WBRT , patient receive oral everolimus daily 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
