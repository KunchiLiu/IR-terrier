	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one common cancer worldwide . The incidence high Asia increase North America , two three fold increase mortality North America expect next two decade . Previous research show tumour often abnormal blood vessel may reduce effect radiation therapy . New drug , know `` anti-angiogenic '' drug show animal human study damage change tumour blood vessel way may make tumor sensitive radiation treatment . 38-44 patient diagnose HCC invite take part study . Upon completion , study establish safety combination radiation sorafenib patient HCC . This also establish preliminary data regard efficacy combination investigate potential imaging serum/tissue marker surrogates tumor response and/or drug activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib-RT Treating Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( SHEP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design include 2 radiation stratum patient , constant radiation dose strata 1 require low volume liver irradiate , variable dose define base effective liver volume irradiate second stratum , require liver volume irradiate , base prior experience . Both stratas one two accrue concurrently . Biologic response assess use standard contrast CT scan . Correlative study biological marker , perfusion CT , microbubble contrast enhance ultrasound also perform .</detailed_description>
