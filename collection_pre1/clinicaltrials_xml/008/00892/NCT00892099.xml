	<detailed_description>We hypothesize profound deficiency nutritional vitamin D ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D , 25D ) end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) lead alter immune response , predispose early morbidity mortality infection , second-leading cause death ESRD . In addition impair renal synthesis hormonal form vitamin D ( 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; 1,25D ) , ESRD accompany near universal insufficiency 25D . In-vitro , ex-vivo , retrospective human study group others suggest 25D ( 1,25D ) intimately link immune defense via alteration production inflammatory cytokine critical antimicrobial peptide include cathelicidin , show identify ESRD subject risk infection-related mortality . Ergocalciferol , rapidly convert 25D , widely available form nutritional vitamin D US , yet guideline treat ESRD patient nutritional vitamin D absent limit data support efficacy , safety , biological effect population . To determine effective safe dos ergocalciferol ESRD , perform double blind placebo control randomized trial 120 incident hemodialysis patient ( 40/arm x 3 ) 25D level &lt; 30ng/ml , compare two ergocalciferol dose regimen ( 50,000 IU/week 50,000 IU/month ) identically appear placebo . The primary outcome correction vitamin D insufficiency ( 25D &gt; 30 ng/ml ) 12 week . Serum calcium phosphate level measure every 4 week assess safety , blood cytokine cathelicidin level measure every 4 week determine biological response . To examine biological effect great detail , subset subject arm study analyze serial macrophage gene expression profile whole blood cytokine profile follow ex-vivo stimulation pro-inflammatory mediator ( e.g. , kill S. aureus ) . These experiment inform u individual ESRD , base vitamin D status treatment receive , may respond infection . Laboratory measure continue 12 week . Clinical follow-up monitoring infection-associated event ( include antibiotic use , rate bacteremia , sepsis ) continue 20 week . This pilot trial address significant unmet need nephrology involve basic , translational , clinical investigator experience vitamin D research , infection inflammation , trial involve ESRD subject . These data provide important foundation design future clinical trial rigorously assess effect nutritional vitamin D infectious outcome ESRD .</detailed_description>
