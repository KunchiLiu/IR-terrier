	<detailed_description>Background Prolonged afferent nociceptive input induces increase excitability central sensory neuron plasticity change cause hyperexcitability central nervous system ( central hypersensitivity . The hyperexcitable central nervous system amplifies nociceptive signal , thereby produce exaggerated pain response even presence limit tissue damage . Using quantitative sensory test , central hypersensitivity detect different chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome . Patients chronic low back pain display increase pain sensitivity enlargement area refer pain stimulation tissue around distant site pain ( i.e . leg thumb ) , suggest widespread central hypersensitivity associate condition . Functional reorganization cortex detect different pain condition , include low back pain . Using equal level sensory stimulation patient pain-free control , patient chronic low back pain show extensive pattern neuronal activation pain-related cortical area . An investigation patient whiplash injury find patient persistent moderate severe symptom 6 month display , soon injury , widespread hypersensitivity . Therefore , central hypersensitivity may indicator poor prognosis . An acute peripheral lesion may induce plasticity change lead central hypersensitivity subset individual . Such hypersensitivity would facilitate transition acute chronic pain disability . This hypothesis investigate use limited number test limit number individual whiplash injury , condition . Objective To determine prognostic value different measure mechanisms central hypersensitivity patient acute low back pain . Methods 140 consecutive Patients acute low back pain , refer general practice , study prospectively . Primary prognostic variable pain tolerance threshold second toe ( pressure intensity increase pressure deem intolerable ) . Exploratory secondary prognostic variable measure mechanisms related central hypersensitivity : stimulus-specific hypersensitivity ( pressure , electrical , heat cold stimulation ) ; tissue-specific hypersensitivity ( skin vs. muscle stimulation ) ; localize vs. widespread hypersensitivity ; spinal cord modulation ( electrophysiological measure hypersensitivity change receptive field ) ; modulation brain level ( descend modulation nociceptive input cortical plasticity ) . Clinical primary outcome occurrence chronic low back pain follow-up . The investigator use least square logistic regression model determine association central hypersensitivity prognosis .</detailed_description>
