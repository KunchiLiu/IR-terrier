	<brief_summary>The purpose protocol pathologically evaluate destruction microwave ablation primary metastatic liver tumor . The primary aim measure tissue destruction MedWaves Microwave Ablation/ Coagulation Ablation System .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microwave Ablation Resectable Liver Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Minimally invasive surgical alternative become attractive treatment malignancy.The goal reduce morbidity mortality increase ability treat patient outpatient set . Image-guided ablation become attractive alternative relative low cost , ability provide large region coagulative necrosis control fashion , relatively low toxicity . Although image-guided ablative technique extensively investigate treatment liver tumor , limited experience microwave ablation ( MWA ) liver . This study evaluate treatment effect MWA liver tumor . Patients undergo planned surgical removal liver tumor tumor intra-operatively treat MWA . The histological change evaluate upon removal specimen .</detailed_description>
