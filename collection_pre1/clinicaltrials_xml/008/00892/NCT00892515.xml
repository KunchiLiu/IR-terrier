	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Exercise may change risk develop breast cancer . It yet know whether low-intensity exercise high-intensity exercise effective lowering risk breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study well exercise program work healthy young woman increase risk develop breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Programs Healthy Young Women Increased Risk Developing Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To conduct dose response study low- high-dose exercise 5 menstrual cycle , concomitant dietary change produce caloric deficit , healthy young woman ≥ 18 % lifetime risk develop breast cancer . - To determine effect exercise regimen variable know associate breast mitotic activity participant . Secondary - To assess change physiologic parameter associate breast mitotic activity ( i.e. , urinary progesterone [ pregnanediol-glucuronide , PdG ] daily first morning urine sample ; follicular phase circulate [ serum ] level estradiol , progesterone , testosterone , prolactin ; follicular phase breast density [ fibroglandular tissue volume ] magnetic resonance imaging ; estrogen metabolite [ estrone , estradiol , estriol , 2-OHE_1 , 2-OHE_2 , 4-OHE_1 , 4-OHE_2 , 16-OHE_1 ratio ] ; adipokines [ i.e. , adiponectin Leptin ] ; body composition [ i.e. , % body fat , lean mass , fat mass , total mass ] ) participant . - To assess extent change body composition and/or body mass mediate observe change participant . - To quantify relationship estrogen progesterone daily urinary measurement observe menstrual cycle alteration follicular luteal phase length change , ovulatory status participant . - To compare level exercise-induced change urinary estrogen , estrogen metabolite , circulate hormone , adipokines , body size across two group woman differ breast cancer risk exploratory manner . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord body mass index ( 21-29.9 v 30-50 ) gynecologic age ( &lt; 10 v ≥ 10 year since start menstruation ) . Participants randomize 1 3 intervention arm . - Arm I ( control ) : Participants place wait list receive exercise intervention completion study . - Arm II : Participants undergo low-intensity exercise program comprise 150 minute exercise per week 20 week . They give treadmill begin study offer ongoing support certify exercise professional . Participants may exercise home provide treadmill gym choosing . Participants must maintain weekly contact exercise professional duration study , either phone brief phone counsel weekly group exercise session participate YMCA . The exercise professional visit participant 's home first exercise session first 5 week help individualize intensity duration exercise session instruct participant use exercise log injury prevention . Exercise intensity measure Polar Heart Rate monitor wear participant record heart rate response exercise . Every two week , exercise professional review downloadable heart-rate data monitor home group exercise session , objectively measure exercise adherence provide guidance emotional support participant . - Arm III : Participants undergo high-intensity exercise program begin 150 minute exercise per week gradually build 300 minute per week 10 week . Participants continue exercise high level end 20-week intervention period . Participants also undergo exercise heart rate monitoring brief phone counsel arm II . Blood urine sample obtain participant periodically and/or study evaluate factor associate breast mitotic activity link breast cancer risk : urinary conjugate ( i.e. , E1G PdG ) enzyme immunoassay ; urinary estrogen metabolite gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ; circulate hormone ( i.e. , estradiol , progesterone , testosterone , prolactin ) radioimmunoassay ; adipokines ( i.e. , adiponectin leptin ) sandwich ELISA . Participants also undergo physical assessment , include periodic measure body composition DEXA , follicular phase breast density ( fibroglandular tissue volume ) MRI , height weight . Aerobic fitness physical activity level also assess . Participants complete survey questionnaire periodically study obtain information demographic , health history , medication use , eat disorder , dietary intake , menstrual history .</detailed_description>
