	<brief_summary>Researchers hope new non-invasive multi-detector scanner ( DSCT ) provide diagnostic information comparable combination traditional SPECT ( function blood flow ) CT imaging ( precise anatomical view ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adenosine Dual Source Computed Tomography ( CT ) Versus Adenosine Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DSCT scanner able assess cardiac blood flow ( myocardial perfusion ) time coronary anatomy . The result derive scan compare standard SPECT imaging . To evaluate obstruction coronary artery , physician may refer invasive Coronary Angiogram , current gold standard diagnosis Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) . By validate DSCT scanner system assess extent obstruction coronary artery , physician may able lessen occurrence invasive exam . Procedures : Each pilot anticipate enrol 20 subject . Pilot 1 : Clinical Follow-up Rest/Stress Adeno-SPECT Research Stress /Rest Adeno-DSCT obtained patient period stress test - Radiation : Thallium injection rest SPECT - Drug : Single dose Adenosine Infusion DSCT SPECT - Radiation : Sestamibi injection stress SPECT - Drug : CT contrast - Radiation : Stress DSCT /Rest DSCT Pilot 2 : Research Stress/ Rest Adeno-DSCT obtain within 30 day initial positive SPECT find - Drug : Adenosine Infusion DSCT - Drug : CT contrast - Radiation : Stress DSCT /Rest DSCT Both pilot study relate result subject history , ECG cardiac angiogram , available</detailed_description>
