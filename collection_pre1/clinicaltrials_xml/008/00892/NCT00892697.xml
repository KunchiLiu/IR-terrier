	<criteria>1 . Male female subject , 1865 year age , inclusive . 2 . Cases genotype 1 ( confirm standard test ) . Enrollment control restrict genotype . 3 . All patient must show evidence chronic hepatitis C , confirm detectable plasma HCV RNA . Chronic disease status must confirm least one follow standard criterion : History remote risk factor , Abnormal ALT level &gt; 6 month prior screen period ( Note : elevate ALT inclusion criterion , one criterion `` chronic '' hepatitis C meet ) , Detectable HCV RNA least 6 month screen period 4 . Liver biopsy obtain within 24 month study enrollment demonstrate absence cirrhosis ( stage 03 ) case . Enrollment control restrict stage fibrosis . 5 . Judged good health basis medical history physical examination ( include vital sign ECG ) , chronic medical condition stable medical control . 6 . Screening Visit laboratory value must within follow : Laboratory variable : acceptable range Absolute neutrophil count : 1200/cmm³ Platelet count : 90,000/cmm³ Hemoglobin : within normal range HbsAg ( screen visit ) : seronegative HIV1 2 Ab ( screen visit ) : seronegative In addition , hematology clinical chemistry must within normal limit show clinically significant abnormality . 7 . Subjects ( female partner ) must pregnant , plan become pregnant within next 72 week , must permanently sterile otherwise non childbearing potential . They must also breastfeed . If childbearing potential , subject must agree use 2 effective method contraception screen 6 month last dose RBV . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use 2 effective method contraception Screening 7 month last dose RBV unless vasectomize . 8 . Female subject must negative pregnancy test visit ( screen predose Day 1 ) first dose study drug . 9 . Willing refrain concomitant use medication , substance food . 10 . Able read understand Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) willing sign ICF abide study requirement restriction . 1 . Received 4 week approve investigational drug drug regimen treatment hepatitis C. 2 . Any medical contraindication PegIFN alpa2a RBV therapy , include follow : 1 . Abnormal thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) level poorly control thyroid function 2 . Evidence clinically significant cardiac dysfunction ; 3 . History psychiatric disorder determine investigator contraindicate use IFNbased therapy ; 4 . Antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) titer 1:320 ; 5 . History hemoglobinopathy . 3 . Patients coinfected either human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . 4 . Decompensated liver disease indicate history ascites , hepatic encephalopathy , bleed esophageal varix . 5 . Diagnosed suspect hepatocellular carcinoma . Alfafetoprotein ( AFP ) screen must less 100 ng/mL . 6 . For case , histologic evidence hepatic cirrhosis liver biopsy Most recent liver biopsy must within 2 year prior study screen . 7 . Has take prohibit medication within 28 day initiation therapy . 8 . A history illness , opinion investigator , might confound result study pose additional risk administer study drug subject . This may include limited history relevant drug food allergy , history cardiovascular central nervous system disease , history presence clinically significant illness , history mental illness may affect compliance study requirement . 9 .
