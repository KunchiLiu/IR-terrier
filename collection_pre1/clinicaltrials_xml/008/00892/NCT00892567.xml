	<brief_title>Evaluating T Cell Response Peptide-based Vaccine Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Just 200,000 American woman diagnose breast cancer year . Standard breast cancer therapy long include surgical resection , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormonal therapy . However , immune therapy explore treatment breast cancer , include peptide-based vaccine . In support direct T cell therapy breast cancer , antigenic epitope breast cancer-associated protein Her-2/neu MAGE gene family identify , vaccine contain peptide derive protein show safe immunogenic breast cancer patient . Results successful immune therapy approach , various human murine cancer , show antitumor effect mediate T cell , proof-of-principle immune system , particular , T cell , reject tumor . Overall , however , complete clinical response rate T cell mediate immunotherapy low . There least two possibility explain may case . First , tumor reactive T cell may traffic tumor . Second , tumor reactive T cell may adequate effector function within tumor microenvironment . Neither hypotheses adequately explore , though data suggest either may represent obstacle successful immune therapy . In order improve upon clinical response rate vaccine , need address question whether vaccine-induced T cell traffic tumor exhibit effector function within tumor . Specifically breast cancer , opportunity target T cell primary tumor intent provide immune protection early disease course . In proposed clinical trial administer peptide-based vaccine monitoring response vaccine site primary tumor . Peptide vaccines unique provide opportunity monitor directly T cell response define antigen , enable dissection immune response pre- post-vaccination . The proposed analysis design test hypotheses vaccination 1 ) enhances T cell infiltration tumor 2 ) induces T cell become activate fully differentiate effector cell . The goal proposal define extent two process occur follow vaccination identify opportunity improve tumor target T cell effector function human breast cancer .</detailed_description>
