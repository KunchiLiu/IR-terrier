	<brief_title>Veliparib Treating Patients With Malignant Solid Tumors That Do Not Respond Previous Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , recommend phase II dose chronically dose single-agent ABT-888 ( veliparib ) patient either refractory breast cancer ( BRCA ) 1/2- mutated solid cancer ; platinum-refractory ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer ; basal-like breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish safety tolerability single-agent ABT-888 patient population . A dose expansion recommend phase II dose perform 6-12 evaluable patient germline BRCA mutation . II . To determine effect ABT-888 treatment level poly ADP-ribose polymerase ( PARP ) inhibition deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) tumor sample cell malignant ascitic fluid . III . To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) chronically dose ABT-888 . IV . To document evidence anti-tumor response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) * day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients receive veliparib day 1 course 1 pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm solid tumor fulfill least one follow 3 criterion : Have document BRCA1/2 mutation BRCA related malignancy ( primarily breast ovarian cancer , also may include prostate pancreatic cancer ) ; NOTE : Patients enrol Dose Expansion Phase must document BRCA 1/2 mutation ; Platinumrefractory ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer Basallike breast cancer whose disease progress follow standard therapy acceptable standard treatment option All patient without know , document BRCA mutation Myriad Genetic Laboratories must probability harbor BRCA gene mutation assess BRCAPRO computer program All patient probability genetic mutation &gt;

platinumresistant define prior response platinum ( i.e . evidence progression within 23 cycle begin initial platinumbased treatment ) platinumresistant patient exclude ; platinumsensitive patient eligible know BRCA mutation Basallike breast cancer define estrogen progesterone receptor negative , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative , and/or expression profile epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) cytokeratins 5/6 , consistent basal phenotype ;
