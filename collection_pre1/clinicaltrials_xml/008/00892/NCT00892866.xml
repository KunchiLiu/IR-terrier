	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine CA-IX , p16 , Ki-67 , mini-chromosome maintenance complex component 2 ( MCM2 ) expression liquid-based cytology ( LBC ) specimens see subset marker provide optimal diagnosis significant cervical lesion woman North America cytologic diagnosis atypical glandular cell ( AGC ) positive test high risk human papillomavirus ( HPV ) . II . To examine high risk HPV , CA-IX , p16 , Ki-67 , MCM2 expression LBC specimens see subset marker provide optimal diagnosis significant cervical lesion woman Japan Korea ( country 's cohort analyze separately ) cytologic diagnosis AGC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether accuracy diagnosis base high risk HPV expression CA-IX , p16 , Ki-67 , and/or MCM2 vary patient age enrollment country enrollment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess biomarker expression , loss heterozygosity , chromosome gains/losses formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue high grade abnormal lesion woman North America , Japan , Korea present cytologic diagnosis AGC cytologic/histologic diagnosis adenocarcinoma situ ( AIS ) . II . To determine CA-IX , p16 , Ki67 , MCM2 expression LBC specimens see subset ( combination ) marker provide high sensitivity diagnosis cervical adenocarcinoma situ ( AIS ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo liquid-based cytology specimen sample collection analysis CA-IX , p16 , Ki-67 , MCM2 expression via immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) presence high risk HPV deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) HPV genotyping .</detailed_description>
