	<brief_title>Hypothalamic Obesity Following Craniopharyngioma Surgery : A Pilot Trial Combined Metformin Diazoxide Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>46 child age 22 year treat surgically craniopharyngioma tumor currently follow Hospital Sick Children , Toronto . Approximately 50 % obese ( BMI â‰¥ 95th percentile age gender assess updated Centre Disease Control growth chart ) , panhypopituitarism require hormone replacement therapy . These child assess regularly Endocrine Clinic also invite attend comprehensive care clinic evaluation endocrinologist ( Principal Investigator ) , neurosurgical clinical nurse practitioner , dietitian , exercise physiologist , psychologist social worker provide multi-disciplinary dietary exercise consultation psychological counseling weight relate concern . This clinic provide infrastructure recruitment follow-up study patient . Recruitment eight subject pilot study occur 6 month patient attend comprehensive clinic . This number choose equivalent number choose pilot study octreotide Lustig show beneficial change body mass index treatment . This study evaluate novel combination therapy child hypothalamic obesity high risk complication . Evaluation insulin resistance metabolic change therapy allow good understand insulin secretion relates weight gain population . Successful therapy pilot set provide necessary data large randomize trial individual hypothalamic obesity include child craniopharyngioma others damage hypothalamus secondary tumor , surgery cranial irradiation .</detailed_description>
