	<brief_summary>The primary aim study : 1 . Assess efficacy aripiprazole augmentation acute continuation treatment TRLLD . Hypothesis 1 : Patients TRLLD ( define remit 12 week acute treatment venlafaxine XR ) high rate remission aripiprazole placebo augmentation ( primary outcome ) great improvement depressive symptom stability remission ( secondary outcome ) . 2 . Assess tolerability aripiprazole TRLLD focus adiposity akathisia/restlessness . Hypothesis 2 : Aripiprazole associate high rate clinically significant akathisia increase adiposity placebo . The Secondary/exploratory aim study : 1 . Examine anxiety , medical burden , executive impairment moderator aripiprazole augmentation efficacy TRLLD . Hypothesis 3 : Pre-levels anxiety symptom , medical burden , executive impairment treatment-specific factor : moderate efficacy aripiprazole augmentation . The aripiprazole-placebo difference great individual variable , compare without variable three factor associate decreased likelihood `` staying course '' venlafaxine monotherapy achieve remission . 2 . Examine genetic predictor ( phase 1 ) moderator ( phase 2-3 ) treatment outcome , control drug exposure . Hypothesis 4 : Selected polymorphism reduce remission rate venlafaxine reduce efficacy tolerability aripiprazole .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incomplete Response Late Life Depression : Getting Remission ( IRL GREY )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Incomplete response treatment late-life depression ( LLD ) large public health challenge : least 50 % old people fail respond adequately antidepressant pharmacotherapy , even optimal treatment condition . Treatment resistant late-life depression ( TRLLD ) increase risk early relapse , undermines adherence treatment coexist medical disorder , amplifies disability cognitive impairment , impose great burden family caregiver , increase risk early mortality , include suicide . Getting sustain remission primary goal treatment , yet paucity control study best manage TRLLD . This multi-site study conduct 3 site : University Pittsburgh , University Toronto , Washington University . We propose enroll 500 subject age 60 old major depressive disorder site treat openly 12 week venlafaxine XR ( 300mg/d ) ( phase 1 ) . Participants meet criterion incomplete response randomly assign receive either aripiprazole ( 2-15 mg/d ; target dose : 10 mg/d ) placebo augmentation ( add pill without active medicine ) venlafaxine 12 week ( phase 2 ) , goal achieve remission ( MADRS≤10 two consecutive assessment ) . Those remit phase 2 receive continuation treatment , double-blinded intervention randomly assign ( phase 3 ) , 12 week determine stability remission . Efficacy tolerability data provide clinically informative estimate benefit risk aripiprazole augmentation TRLLD . In addition primary goal assess benefit risk , develop evidence relevant personalize treatment LLD test role clinical ( comorbid anxiety , medical burden , executive impairment ) genetic ( select polymorphisms serotonin , norepinephrine , dopamine gene ) variable , control variability drug exposure efficacy tolerability analyse . This approach allow u distinguish treatment-specific resistance factor versus general prognostic factor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; 60 year . 2 . Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , single recurrent , diagnose SCIDIV . 3 . MADRS ≥ 15 . 1 . Inability provide inform consent . 2 . Depressive symptom severe enough ( i.e. , MADRS &lt; 15 ) baseline assessment . 3 . Dementia base upon DSMIV criterion well Folstein MMSE score less 24 . Patients screen due dementia refer memory clinic UPMC Alzheimer 's Disease Research Center evaluation clarify presence absence dementia . 4 . Lifetime diagnosis bipolar I II disorder , schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , schizophreniform disorder , delusional disorder , current psychotic symptom , diagnose SCID . A recommendation psychiatric referral make case . 5 . Abuse dependence alcohol substance within past 3 month determine SCID , confirm study physician interview . 6 . High risk suicide ( e.g. , active SI and/or current/recent intent plan ) AND unable manage safely clinical trial ( e.g. , unwilling hospitalize ) . Urgent psychiatric referral make case . 7 . Contraindication venlafaxine XR aripiprazole determine study physician include history intolerance either venlafaxine XR aripiprazole study target dosage range ( venlafaxine XR 225 mg/day ; aripiprazole 15mg/day ) . 8 . Failure respond least 6 week venlafaxine ( &gt; 225 mg/d ) plus aripiprazole ( &gt; 10 mg/d ) . 9 . Inability communicate English ( i.e. , interview conduct without interpreter ; subject largely unable understand question respond English ) . 10 . Noncorrectable clinically significant sensory impairment ( i.e. , hear well enough cooperate interview ) 11 . Unstable medical illness , include delirium , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , cerebrovascular cardiovascular risk factor medical management . This determine base information patient 's personal physician 's study physician clinical judgment . Referral patient 's personal physician general practitioner make case . 12 . Subjects take psychotropic medication safely taper discontinue prior study initiation : would include patient Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOI ) would need MAOI 14 day eligible study avoid adverse drug interaction . Patients allow take antidepressant atypical antipsychotic medication study medication , unless low dose antidepressant prescribe chronic pain would medically advisable stop ( e.g. , amitryptyline 50mg ) . If patient 's depression adequately treat his/her psychotropic medication , he/she would eligible study . If patient fail trial venlafaxine ( 12 week treatment venlafaxine include least 6 week 300mg/day ) , he/she would eligible . The following allowed : benzodiazepine 2mg/d lorazepam equivalent ; sedativehypnotics ( e.g. , zolpidem , zaleplon , eszopiclone ) ; gabapentin prescribed nonpsychiatric indication ( e.g. , neuropathy ) . Except MAOIs , really clinical rationale exclude patient specific concomitant medication unless medically unstable ( case exclude participation ) . As noted , patient MAOI would need MAOI 14 day protect adverse drug interaction .</criteria>
