	<brief_title>Identifying Brain Genetic Markers Sertraline Treatment Response People With Social Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) anxiety disorder characterize excessive fear avoidance social situation . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) medication commonly prescribe treat social anxiety disorder , many 50 % people SAD respond SSRIs . Current theory suggest neurological function genetics may influence patient 's response treatment . This study examine variation genetics brain reactivity among people SAD respond SSRIs . Through , study identify neurological genetic biomarkers predict responsiveness SSRI treatment people SAD . Participation study last 14 week . Both healthy people people SAD recruit participate . All participant complete similar study visit entry , within 2 week entry , 12 week . The first visit , occur study entry , include screen questionnaire , interview research staff , medical screening , urine test , collection saliva sample genotyping . The second visit last visit , separate 12 week , involve MRI scan behavioral task conduct inside outside MRI scanner . Over 12 week MRI scan session , participant SAD take sertraline , common SSRI , daily basis . They also attend five additional visit time complete assessment symptom . These visit occur 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 week start sertraline treatment . Participants SAD therefore complete symptom assessment , MRI scan , behavioral task final visit , 12 week second visit .</detailed_description>
