	<brief_title>Evaluation Non-Invasive Assays Detection Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bladder cancer one common malignancy worldwide . The rate occurrence tumor high developed country , rank sixth frequent neoplasm . Approximately 90 % malignant tumor arise bladder epithelial origin , majority transitional cell carcinoma . Early stage bladder tumor classify two group distinct behavior different molecular profile : Low-grade tumor ( always papillary usually superficial ) , high-grade tumor ( either papillary non-papillary often invasive ) . Clinically , superficial bladder tumor ( stage Ta , Tis T1 ) account 75-80 % bladder neoplasm , remain 15-20 % invasive ( T2 , T3 , T4 ) metastatic lesion time presentation . Over 70 % patient affected superficial tumor one recurrences initial treatment , one-third patient progress eventually succumb disease . Previous publication Urology Department introduce idea non-invasive , molecular-based assay detection monitor bladder cancer ( Levesque et al . 1993 ; Fitzgerald et al . 1995 ) . At time publication limit knowledge molecular change underlie different clinical pathway outline assay base one gene ( c-H-ras-1 ) . In last year , become clear activation event associate FGFR-3 find associate 40 % -60 % low-grade , low-stage bladder tumor whilst p53 mutation link aggressive phenotype progress via CIS pathway . Mutations find c-H-ras-1 gene straddle group . We propose assess use multiple mutation-based assay , use DNA exfoliate cell urine patient , establish sensitivity specificity tumor detection compare cystoscopy cytology . In addition , propose isolate free-DNA use molecular assay . The remain urine store evaluate biomarkers detection tumor presence progression use protein-based analysis . Cancer Patient Group : All patient harbor tumor schedule cystectomy , cystoscopy , nephroureterectomy eligible study . This include patient first presentation follow-up . Urine sample collect time procedure obtain catheterized urine operating room . Urine obtain clinic setting obtain via voiding , standard urine sample collection . We propose collect urine study participant cystoscopy occasion visit Urology Department regard treatment follow-up disease . The urine collect interval two-year period . Control Patient Group : The cancer assays test use DNA analysis antibody specific protein well functional assay proteins attempt identify bladder tumor presence . It important know whether change , include kidney stone , cystitis etc . cause release DNA proteins urine find cancer patient . The frequency false positive result determine utility assay cancer detection arena . A patient group age-matched control recruit aforementioned patient population require single urine donation time schedule clinic visit . The primary objective study evaluate utility emerge technology detection bladder tumor cell use non-invasive approach utilize voided urine sample . This include methodologies establish sensitivity detection specific mutation associate bladder cancer progression utility approach complement cystoscopy cytology . The mutation status amplify DNA fragment establish use multiple molecular technique . We also isolate free-DNA urine perform extended-PCR ascertain proportional representation large DNA fragment i.e . &gt; 1,500bp indicator apoptotic activity evaluate microRNA profile urine sample . Urine-borne exfoliated cell pelleted urine collection use centrifugation DNA/RNA extract . The urine supernatant run DNA affinity column capture free-DNA analysis . Nucleic acid isolate procedure analyze use PCR various molecular technology establish mutation status different gene locus . The remain urine frozen use protein detection assay use panel biomarkers putative prognostic significance . Detection tumor presence compare urine specimen undergo mutational analysis current standard treatment ( cytology cystoscopy together ) . As cytology perform patient , few urine specimen expect cytology cystoscopy group mutational analysis group . Therefore comparative analysis two group perform use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) test significance set p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
