	<brief_title>BMTP-11 Patients With Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer With Bone Mets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : BMTP-11 design use protein bind cancer cell , move cancer cell , cause cancer cell die . This first study use BMTP-11 human . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level BMTP-11 base join study . Up 2 dose level BMTP-11 test . Three ( 3 ) participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose BMTP-11 found . Study Drug Administration : On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle , receive BMTP-11 though needle vein 2 hour . Before dose BMTP-11 , receive saline ( salt water ) vein 2 hour . Study Visits : On Days 7 14 Cycles 1 2 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) collect routine test . A portion blood also use check heart health . - Urine collect 24 hour test kidney function . On Day 21 Cycles 1 2 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) collect routine test . A portion blood also use check heart health . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) testosterone level . - Urine collect 24 hour test kidney function . On Day 1 Cycle 2 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) collect routine test . A portion blood also use check heart health . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure PSA testosterone level . Length Study : You active study 9 week . You take study experience intolerable side effect disease get bad . Please note even treatment beneficial effect cancer , treatment continue two cycle due limit supply drug available . End-of-Study Visit : Between 4 6 week last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . This routine blood draw include measurement PSA testosterone level . A part blood also use see immune system react BMTP-11 form antibody assess heart 's health . - Urine collect 24 hour test protein urine . - You CT MRI scan abdomen pelvis check status disease . - You chest x-ray . - You bone scan check status disease . Follow-Up : At 3 , 6 , 9 month last dose study drug , call e-mailed ask . This take minute . You require blood drawn ( 1 teaspoon ) routine test . This do local doctor 's office result fax MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) . This investigational study . BMTP-11 FDA approve commercially available . At time , BMTP-11 use research . Up 22 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Have histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate , clinically significant bone metastasis exhibit castrateresistant progression . Progression define follow : 1 ) New lesion obviously worsen lesion bone scan within previous three month ; 2 ) PSA double time &lt; 3 month ; 3 ) New progressive symptom require change therapy referable cancer ; 4 ) New extraosseous lesion within past 3 month 2 . Have progression face serum testosterone less 50 ng/dL , either fail refuse chemotherapy 3 . Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 4 . Have adequate bone marrow function define absolute peripheral granulocyte count &gt; /= 1,000/mm^3 platelet count &gt; /= 140,000/mm^3 ; hemoglobin &gt; /= 9.0 g/dL ( without transfusion growth factor support ) , unless patient &lt; 6 week last cancer therapy case transfusion allow . 5 . Have adequate hepatic function define total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 mg/dl AST &lt; /= 2* upper limit normal 6 . Have adequate renal function define serum creatinine &lt; /= 1.5* upper limit normal creatinine clearance &gt; /= 60 mL/min ( measure calculate ) . In absence hematuria , patient must either negative urinalysis protein ( i.e . `` trace '' dipstick ) 24 hour urine collection show less 1,000 mg protein/24 hour . In presence hematuria , patient may 2,000 mg protein/24 hour . 7 . Have adequate cardiovascular function define : ) normal betanatruetic peptide ( BNP ) ii ) sign symptom suggestive cardiac disease iii ) normal Electrocardiography ( ECG ) . Alternatively , patient meeting criterion still eligible ) echocardiogram show ejection fraction ( EF ) 45 % great ( `` mild '' diastolic dysfunction ) ii ) Brain Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) &lt; 200 8 . Sign current Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study , keep policy institution 9 . Age &gt; /= 18 year old 1 . Small cell prostate cancer 2 . Infectious process , , opinion investigator , could worsen outcome affect , result investigational therapy 3 . Any following previous 6 month : New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III/IV congestive heart failure , unstable angina , cerebrovascular accident ( include transient ischemic attack ) , pulmonary embolism myocardial infarction ( ECG serologic criterion ) 4 . Significant comorbidity could affect safety evaluability participant , include : ) Chronically uncontrolled hypertension , define conventionally consistent systolic pressure 140 diastolic pressure 90 despite therapy . Note NOT criterion relate particular BP result time assessment eligibility , apply acute BP excursion related iatrogenic cause , acute pain transient , reversible cause . ( Please see explanation Treatment Plan ) 5 . ( # 4 cont 'd ) b ) uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( define Hgb A1c &gt; 8.5 , symptomatic hypoglycemic episode &gt; 1 per week two month prior eligibility evaluation , 1 glucose excursion &gt; 300 mg/dL prior two monthsunless clearly iatrogenic cause eliminate ) , c ) lung disease require supplemental oxygen , ) know chronic liver disease , e ) HIV infection 6 . Hydronephrosis ( either bilateral involve solitary kidney ) address mean nephrostomy indwell stent . ( Nonobstructive hydronephrosis set prior urinary diversion allow . ) 7 . Overt psychosis , mental disability otherwise incompetent grant inform consent history noncompliance medical care 8 . Patients must require ongoing therapy nonsteroidal antiinflammatories ( NSAIDs ) , lowdose ( i.e . 81 mg less ) aspirin daily , i.v . vancomycin , aminoglycosides , potently nephrotoxic drug , must agree abstain NSAIDs duration participation trial 9 . Any medical condition opinion principal investigator would compromise ability deliver evaluate study drug 10 . Unwillingness maintain adequate contraception measure entire course study 11 . Any therapy prostate cancer ( ongoing androgen deprivation associate hormonal therapy diethylstilbesterol , lowdose dexamethasone , megace , etc ) two week prior start BMTP11</criteria>
