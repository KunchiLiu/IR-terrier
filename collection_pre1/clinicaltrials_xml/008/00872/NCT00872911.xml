	<brief_summary>The investigator ' general hypothesis nutritional factor , include protein/energy malnutrition and/or impaired response muscle nutrition , inactivity play significant role develop sarcopenia , involuntary loss muscle mass function age . Therefore , age-specific prolonged intervention include nutritional manipulation and/or exercise may help reduce , stabilize , even reverse sarcopenia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our preliminary study indicate , old adult , muscle protein anabolism normally stimulate amino acid alone , impaired nutritional stimulus contain carbohydrate due relative insulin resistance muscle protein synthesis . We also find amino acid efficient nutrient acute stimulation muscle protein anabolism pilot data suggest also increase muscle mass healthy old adult . Inactivity another likely contributor sarcopenia . Exercise increase muscle protein synthesis , mass strength , also energy expenditure . Hence , exercise may improve response muscle nutritional intervention older subject via increase energy requirement food consumption , thereby allow achievement true supplementation . We test follow specific hypothesis older , community indwelling , sedentary subject : Using factorial design address old , community-indwelling , sedentary subject follow hypothesis : 1 . Nutritional supplementation amino acid improve muscle mass , strength , function , quality , protein synthesis . 2 . Progressive exercise train 24 week improve muscle mass strength , function , quality , perfusion , protein metabolism . 3 . Combined treatment nutritional supplementation progressive exercise train 24 week improve muscle mass , strength , function , quality , perfusion , protein metabolism either intervention alone . Our goal establish specific intervention acutely increase muscle protein synthesis also effectively translate increased muscle mass and/or performance old sedentary people , thus prevent frailty promote physical independence . To end use stable isotope methodology measure muscle protein metabolism contrast enhance ultrasound measure muscle perfusion , order determine treatment ' acute effect predict chronic impact muscle mass function . We also determine chronic treatment lead metabolic and/or vascular adaptation may explain measured change muscle mass function .</detailed_description>
