	<brief_summary>Normally gastrointestinal tract sparsely colonized bacteria . The normal flora duodenal jejunal aspirate contain 10^5 bacteria per milliliter . Small bowel bacterial overgrowth ( SBBO ) define pathologically increased number bacteria presence colonic flora proximal intestine . The reason condition manifold , range diabetic neuropathy surgical bypass . SBBO frequent elderly people . Therapy target correct underlie small bowel abnormality predispose condition provide appropriate antibiotic therapy . The symptom sign SBBO reverse approach . However , many patient condition predispose SBBO persist life-long , present . This suggest noninvasive , sensitive diagnostic tool high specificity require . Bacterial culture upper intestinal content consider diagnostic gold standard . However , since endoscopic harvest duodenal jejunal fluid difficult invasive , indirect test breath test advocate diagnostic tool . Hydrogen breath test commonly employ since substrate easily obtain measurement simple . Hydrogen form carbohydrate ferment intestine . Breath hydrogen analysis allow separation metabolic activity intestinal flora host , since know hydrogen production occur mammalian tissue . The hydrogen breath test often use routine clinical practice use glucose . However , utility test mostly limit low sensitivity , `` nonproducers '' 25 % subject test . The investigator develop stable isotope breath test use 13C-labeled lactose-ureide . Glycosyl-ureides condensation product reduce sugar urea aqueous acid . Lactose- [ 13C ] ureide used investigate oro-caecal transit time resist digestion small intestinal enzyme hydrolyze bacterial enzyme large intestine . A number study describe use substrate adult child . The aim present study investigate lactose- [ 13C ] ureide breath test subject suspect SBBO compare result result glucose hydrogen breath test . Microbiological analysis upper intestinal bacterial culture use gold standard identify SBBO .</brief_summary>
