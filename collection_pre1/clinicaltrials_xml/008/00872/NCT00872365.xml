	<brief_summary>At moment , effort prevent non-transmissible chronic disease population level center promote healthful behavior like physical activity , consumption fruit vegetable , discourage consumption tobacco alcohol adult population , result little hopeful . In last year , manifold study indicate relation metabolic alteration fetal growth development non-transmissible chronic disease adult age . More recently , propose maternal factor ( endothelial function , oxidative stress alteration adipokines ) placental one ( mitochondrial dysfunction ) precursory mechanisms fetal metabolic alteration later development non-transmissible chronic disease . Also , suggest possibly supplementation micronutrient physical exercise gestation regulate maternal placental factor . For reason mention , necessary clarify propose factor related fetal metabolic alteration supplementation gestation micronutrient and/or physical exercise regulate , would early novel alternative fortify prevention non-transmissible chronic disease population . Purpose 1 . To evaluate effect associate maternal placental metabolic factor non-transmissible chronic disease newborn . 2 . To evaluate effect physical exercise complementation micronutrient pregnancy either endothelial function , level adipokines , oxidative stress mother newborn , placental mitochondrial function anthropometry newborn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : 1 . There correlation metabolic factor , relate non-transmissible chronic disease , mother newborn one . 2 . Supplementation either micronutrient physical exercise influence beneficially much endothelial function , oxidative stress , level adipokines mother newborn one like placental mitochondrial function . 3 . The simultaneous intervention micronutrient physical exercise produce additional beneficial effect metabolic state mother newborn one . 4 . The metabolic alteration bear exclusive newborn anthropometric measure locate either inferior superior percentile .</detailed_description>
