	<brief_title>Preventing Depression People Receiving Mechanical Ventilation Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More one third people admit ICUs hospital require mechanical ventilation respiratory failure . Many people survive mechanical ventilation prolong time significant issue recovery quality life discharge ICU . They also prone depression , increase patient suffer need medical care , decrease quality life , associate increased mortality . Previous research indicate antidepressant medication may improve quality life recovery people heart attack , behavioral treatment effective case . Treating depression ICU patient respiratory failure examine . In study , antidepressant medication give people mechanical ventilation ICU determine effectiveness antidepressant improve medical recovery quality life . Only small number participant enrol trial test method theory ; successful , large trial conduct determine whether finding widely generalize . Participation study last 8 week , follow-up assessment last 6 month . Participants ventilation machine randomly assign receive either escitalopram , FDA-approved antidepressant , placebo pill . A healthy surrogate may need enroll participant study , participant begin treatment ICU may able make informed decision .
