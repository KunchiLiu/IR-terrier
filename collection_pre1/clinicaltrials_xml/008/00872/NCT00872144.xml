	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy often use treat cancer many case cure extend life . Unfortunately many chemotherapeutic agent use treat cancer cause nerve damage , result severe pain involve extremity . This `` neuropathic '' pain cause significant suffer cancer survivor may also limit amount chemotherapy patient able tolerate attempt treat cancer . There evidence cannabinoids suppress chemotherapy evoke neuropathy animal model , case better morphine . This study propose examine effect cannabinoid extract ( Sativex ) treatment neuropathic pain cause chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sativex Treatment Chemotherapy Induced Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The problem neuropathic pain : A recent review identify neuropathic pain prevalence rate 2-3 % general population 1 . Based Canadian population 30 million , mean close one million Canadians suffer neuropathic pain . Neuropathic pain one difficult type persistent pain treat effectively . No 50 % 2 patient neuropathic pain obtain adequate relief use current treatment . This related fact numerous pathophysiological mechanism contribute neuropathic pain . Neuropathic pain understood involve neural response peripheral central mechanism contribute generation spontaneous pain evoke aspect include allodynia hyperalgesia 3-5 , Traditional approach neuropathic pain involve use oral medication single agent combination ( NSAIDs , opioids , anticonvulsant , tricyclic type antidepressant ) 6,7 . Unfortunately approach often inadequate accompany side effect . New treatment need management neuropathic pain Neuropathic pain associate chemotherapy : Neuropathic pain associate chemotherapy use treatment solid tumor ( eg . paclitaxil , vincristine cis-platin ) particularly resistant treatment grow clinical problem chemotherapeutic regime grow successful extend life . This type neuropathic pain particularly resistant treatment contribute overall level suffering experienced patient recover cancer treatment chemotherapy . There pre-clinical evidence support cannabinoid agonist may helpful treatment neuropathic pain cause chemotherapy . Cannabinoids treatment pain : The potent anti-nociceptive antihyperalgesic effect cannabinoid agonist animal model acute chronic pain , presence cannabinoid receptor pain-processing area brain , spinal cord periphery evidence support endogenous modulation pain system cannabinoids , provide support cannabinoids exhibit significant potential analgesics8-13 . In addition sixteen 19 randomize control trial examine cannabinoids treatment pain demonstrate significant analgesic effect , nine positive trial involve neuropathic pain 14 . Several trial examine cannabinoid extract preparation Sativex15-20 propose current trial . What current standard care neuropathic pain cause chemotherapy ? The current standard care neuropathic pain associate chemotherapy similar management chronic neuropathic pain . The approach consist interdisciplinary active participatory approach live incurable pain . This include trial pharmacotherapy ( eg . anti-convulsant analgesic , tricyclic antidepressant analgesic opioids ) , therapeutic exercise program train cop strategy pace positive self talk . Such approach offer multidisciplinary pain centre Pain Management Unit ( PMU ) CDHA . Study question : Given limitation current best practice , compel pre-clinical work support cannabinoids exhibit anti-nociceptive effect neuropathic pain specifically chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain initial clinical trial support Sativex exhibit efficacy type neuropathic pain propose pilot trial 30 patient evaluate effectiveness Sativex treatment neuropathic pain cause chemotherapy . If positive therapeutic effect pilot trial , plan subsequent randomize controlled trial .</detailed_description>
