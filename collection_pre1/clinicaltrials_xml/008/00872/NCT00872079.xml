	<brief_summary>This study create computer program use help dose drug call warfarin prevention blood clotting . The study collect specific information patient receive drug use information create computer program predict effect drug . With prediction program place , investigator perform series `` I give amount drug '' simulation determine best dose drug patient . Once computer program develop , investigator test program patient actually need drug . They also include genetic information prediction since show information affect well drug work . Patients genetic information determine study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective project develop new technique incorporate genomic data pharmacodynamic model improve dose chronically administer drug . Specifically , investigator look improve warfarin therapy decrease variability effect drug use information subject genotype computational intelligence . The investigator propose achieve objective use prospective , randomize , control clinical trial computer program develop historical prospective data . This computer program test control group use standard warfarin dosing , group use standard dose plus subject genotype . Warfarin dose response data obtain patient see Louisville VA anticoagulation clinic . Following informed consent , subject genotype cytochrome P450 allele 2C9 ( 2C9 ) vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 ( VKORC1 ) determine . Other data routinely obtain aid warfarin dosing also record . Using information , investigator develop many different model warfarin dose use incrementally information . Each model test use computer simulation obtain best model . This model use pilot study test performance real time . The result pilot study use power final clinical trial standard dosing , standard dose genetic information , computer dosing , computer dose plus genetic information . The specific aim research : 1 . Determine structure type neural network model prediction historically obtain data . ( Computer Model ) 2 . Prospectively develop individualized neural network nonlinear mixed effect modelling ( NONMEM ) model capable predict erythropoietin dose chronic in-center hemodialysis patient use adaptive technique . 3 . Develop computer program base neural compute used clinical setting . ( Computer Model ) 4 . Determine utility computer program prospectively clinical setting .</detailed_description>
