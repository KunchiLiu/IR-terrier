	<brief_title>Sildenafil Improve Exercise Capacity People With Thalassemia Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thalassemia inherit blood disorder body make abnormal form hemoglobinâ€”the protein red blood cell carry oxygen . A potential complication thalassemia pulmonary hypertension , condition characterize abnormally high blood pressure arteries lung . People thalassemia pulmonary hypertension tend experience health complication , include shortness breath reduce exercise capacity , people thalassemia pulmonary hypertension . Sildenafil medication use treat pulmonary hypertension ; however , yet study people thalassemia . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness sildenafil reduce blood pressure lungs people thalassemia pulmonary hypertension . Study researcher also compare difference people thalassemia pulmonary hypertension pulmonary hypertension . This study enroll people thalassemia pulmonary hypertension control group people thalassemia pulmonary hypertension . People thalassemia pulmonary hypertension attend baseline study visit time undergo follow procedure : medical history medical record review ; physical exam ; 6-minute walk test , measure far participant walk 6 minute ; echocardiogram obtain image heart ; blood collection ; female , urine collection . Participants begin take sildenafil three time day 12 week . At study visit Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , participant undergo repeat baseline testing , participant take part exhale nitric oxide test . At Week 12 , participant also undergo lung function test chest magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedure . Participants control group attend one three study visit baseline , include baseline study procedure list , plus lung function testing , chest MRI , chest compute tomography ( CAT ) scan , exhale nitric oxide test . They receive medication study visit .</detailed_description>
