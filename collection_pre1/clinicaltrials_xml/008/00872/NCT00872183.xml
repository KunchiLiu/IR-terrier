	<brief_summary>Background : - Techniques teach finger movement commonly use explore human learn move . Researchers design simple , new method learning finger movement , explore first time study . The method base individual mimic people 's movement . - Previous study show brain protein call brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) may important movement learning . There normal variation gene BDNF . As optional component , study also look whether gene variation associate difference movement learning . Objectives : - To compare new motor learning technique classic technique test usefulness . - To examine whether genetic variation effect motor learning . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer age 18 50 , right-handed . Design : - The study involve two visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - Visit 1 : Medical neurologic examination determine whether volunteer eligible participate study . This screening visit take 1 hour . - Visit 2 : Volunteers perform motor learn task interact computer program . In response image computer monitor , volunteer press button keyboard quickly accurately possible . The motor learn task last 3 hour . - If volunteer agree genetic testing , researcher also draw blood study . Genetic testing require participate motor learning part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Humans develop skilled movement use spoon dance waltz process know `` motor learning . Harnessing innate process therapeutic potential attractive strategy help patient suffer disease movement disorder , yet yet fully understand normal phenomenon . This study utilize new paradigm explore physiology motor learning . It test validity traditional motor learn task modify invoke mirror neuron system odor conditioning . Additionally , take advantage unique opportunity ass motor learn awareness immediately follow task , also explore behavioral-cognitive relationship . Thus , work lay foundation physiologic characterization novel motor learn technique may support development future therapy . Study Population We study one hundred fifty-two healthy , right-handed volunteer 18 50 year old . Design In phase I study , volunteer seat front computer monitor right hand keyboard respond visual cue present monitor press associate , finger-specific key quickly accurately possible . Each volunteer present standard visuospatial novel mirror cue , define two reaction time task paradigm experimental group . In phase II III study , similar task take place subject undergo magnetic resonance image scan either presence absence odor . In addition motor learn task , volunteer option participate genetic test normal genetic variability may affect motor learn . Outcome Measure The primary outcome motor learn awareness , measure key-press reaction time accuracy , respectively .</detailed_description>
