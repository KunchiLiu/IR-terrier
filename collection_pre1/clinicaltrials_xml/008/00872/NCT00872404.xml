	<brief_summary>This open-label phase II , multicenter study . Eligible patient receive CP-751,871 monotherapy ( 20 mg/kg IV infusion Day 1 3-week cycle ) . Tumor check-up perform every 6-8 week . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity accord patient investigator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study CP-751,871 Patients With Recurrent Squamous Head Neck Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CP-751,871 administer open-label intravenous solution . All patient treat every 3 week disease progression ( RECIST criterion ) unacceptable toxicity death discontinuation study reason . Since , head neck tumor easily accessible iterative biopsy , study offer opportunity get tumor biopsy CP-751,871 . Our study allow translational research biopsy crucial timing : ( ) baseline treatment , ( ii ) treatment CP-751,871 ( day 1 , second cycle two hour injection CP-751,871 ) . ( iii ) patient stable disease partial response , new biopsy perform time disease progression try understand mechanism tumor resistance . The baseline sample allow investigation molecular profile reflect inherent inter-patient variability predictive response . Although number patient include low , data may contribute understand mechanisms response non-response CP-751,871 . Understanding mechanisms response CP-751,871 help rational design clinical trial head neck cancer use CP-751,871 . The on-treatment sample help dynamically monitor molecular response CP-751,871 . The study involve pathway administration CP-751,871 could perform use IHC , DNA sequence analysis RNA expression profile . Plasma sample could also store analysis .</detailed_description>
