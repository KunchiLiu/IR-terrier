	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vandetanib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether docetaxel effective give alone together vandetanib . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study docetaxel give together without vandetanib see well work treat patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0904 : Docetaxel With Without Vandetanib Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate clinical efficacy docetaxel vandetanib relative docetaxel alone patient platinum-resistant , recurrent , refractory , progressive/persistent ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer , measure progression-free survival . - To evaluate response rate ( complete partial ) duration overall survival patient . - To evaluate response ( complete partial ) time treatment failure treatment single agent vandetanib follow progression single agent docetaxel . - To evaluate frequency severity adverse event assess Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) v4.0 . - To evaluate toxicity single agent vandetanib follow docetaxel assess CTCAE v4.0 . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord prior treatment antiangiogenesis agent ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progress also receive oral vandetanib daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence second disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 oral vandetanib daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
