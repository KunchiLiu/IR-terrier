	<detailed_description>Thirty-nine boy girl age 6-12 rigorously diagnose DSM-IV ADHD currently take medication twice-randomized : first active neurofeedback ( n=26 ) vs. sham neurofeedback ( n=13 ) , simultaneously 2 vs. 3 time week treatment frequency ( least 18 frequency , 12 active 6 sham ) 40 treatment . At treatment 24 , major assessment include measure satisfaction blinding , subject give option switch opposite treatment frequency remain 16 treatment generate practical measure schedule palatability .

Every 3 treatment parent rate ADHD symptoms every 6 treatment teacher rate , track response curve time . Baseline EEG arousal ADHD subtype examine possible moderator .
