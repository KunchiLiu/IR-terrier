	<brief_summary>The neurological basis tinnitus uncertain evidence damage peripheral auditory system . However , neuroimaging study tinnitus patient show hyperactivity several cortical region , especially auditory cortex middle temporal region . A potentially promising treatment modality tinnitus repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . rTMS involve application frequent , repeat magnetic stimulus skull induce electrical activity underlie cortical area brain . When magnetic device place skull , resultant magnetic field pass skull induces small secondary current cortex . It hypothesize effect frequency use rTMS differentially influence cortical activity low-frequency ( 1Hz ) stimulation decrease high-frequency stimulation ( 10-20 Hz ) increase cortical activity . Currently , report treat tinnitus rTMS focus low-frequency stimulation leave auditory cortex , area demonstrate hyperactive tinnitus . The benefit low-frequency auditory cortex stimulation time limited however . Converging data implicate structure brain important mood attention play role maintenance tinnitus ; suggest alternative rTMS treatment approach target structure . A grow number study demonstrate involvement prefrontal cortex generation maintenance tinnitus . rTMS stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex association stimulation temporoparietal cortex show increase durability TPC stimulation . The independent effect rTMS stimulation DLPFC know . Studies depression suggest increase intensity duration stimulation beneficial treatment effect . However , field new work need assess effectiveness treatment , predictor correlate response , safety . Herein , propose open-label pilot study investigate effectiveness rTMS stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , area know important mood attention , treatment tinnitus</brief_summary>
