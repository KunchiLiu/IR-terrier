	<brief_summary>Up ¾ patient diagnose Crohn 's disease ( CD ) undergo bowel resection lifetime despite modern medical therapy . Unfortunately , disease recurrence common endoscopic detection recur inflammation precedes clinical relapse . Endoscopic investigation therefore recommend manage patient . This multi center , prospective study compare conventional endoscopic method , ileo-colonoscopy new technique , i.e. , colonic capsule endoscopy ( CCE ) . CCE enable investigation small bowel large intestine use double-sided video camera 10 hour acquisition time . This study aim evaluate performance CCE detect postoperative recurrence CD detection rate colonic anastomotic recurrence compare ileo-colonoscopy . Proximal ( small bowel ) lesion additionally record impact clinical management finding account . Moreover , safety aspect influence finding progress disease monitor . All consecutive patient operated CD participate study center eligible . Included patient segmental small bowel , ileocecal segmental colonic resection . In case capsule retention report average 2-3 % CD patient elevate risk . Therefore , patency capsule perform application video CCE exclude bowel obstruction . Sample size estimation result n = 70 , require 140 capsule endoscope 140 patency capsule performance postoperative screening ( ca 4-8 week postoperatively ) detection postoperative recurrence ( ca 4-8 month postoperatively ) .</brief_summary>
