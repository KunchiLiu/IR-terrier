	<brief_summary>Primary objective : - To estimate degree agreement diagnosis cytologic sample mediastinal lymph node obtain Endobronchial Ultrasound ( EBUS ) -guided Fine Needle Capillary Sampling ( FNC ) versus Fine Needle Aspiration ( FNA ) . Secondary objective : - To compare quality cytologic sample mediastinal lymph node obtain EBUS-guided FNC versus FNA . The quality sample assess initially MDACC on-site cytology technician , corroborate physician department cytology . This assessment perform utilizing Mair 's score 3 . The score consist 0-10 scale : 1-2= poor ; 3-6=good ; 7-10=superior .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tissue Sample Collection : If agree take part study , already schedule endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy perform give drug make sleep . You ask sign separate inform consent biopsy procedure . During standard care biopsy procedure , normally 3-5 tissue sample collection perform . For purpose study , total 4 tissue collection perform biopsy procedure . Two tissue collection ( 2 ) use FNC method , 2 tissue collection use FNA method . If first 4 tissue sample collection provide good enough tissue sample perform diagnosis , additional sample collection may perform . If sample collect , sample use purpose study collect diagnostic purposes.The sample do pulmonologist perform procedure . The first 4 tissue sample collect purpose study examine determine quality sample well diagnostic purpose . Medical Record Information : Information medical record collect 1 time study . The information collect include information diagnosis , number radiation treatment may , additional information medical history . The information de-identified store research database password protect computer study doctor study staff access . Length Study : You remain study duration biopsy procedure . After biopsy perform , medical record information collect longer study . This investigational study . The endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy lymph node FDA approve . Both method tissue collection ( FNA FNC ) FDA approve purpose study . Up 200 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
