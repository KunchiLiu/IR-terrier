	<brief_title>Study Effect Drug Gabapentin Postoperative Pain Incidence Postoperative Nausea Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The occurrence morbid obesity epidemic proportion United States . Laparoscopic gastric bypass effective mean safely facilitating patient weight loss thereby drastically reduce prevalence severity many future health complication [ 1 ] . However , manage morbidly obese surgical patient pose certain obstacle anesthesiologist , include high incidence obstructive sleep apnea [ 2 ] . Laparoscopic gastric bypass , like surgical intervention , associate postoperative challenge include pain management prevention/control postoperative nausea vomit . To assure high patient satisfaction , area patient comfort must address . However , pain management morbidly obese patient , caution must use administer opioids , increase effect respiratory depression patient already risk due obstructive sleep apnea [ 3 ] . Gastric bypass also associate significant incidence protract postoperative nausea vomit [ 4 ] . Therefore , regimens address patient safety patient comfort desire . Gabapentin ( Neurontin ) alkylated analog inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) FDA approve treatment seizure , headache fibromyalgia chronic neuropathic pain due various etiology [ 5 ] . Many randomize controlled trial perform perioperative gabapentin [ 6-10 ] . The effect perioperative administration gabapentin postoperative pain opioid consumption extensively study several meta-analyses publish last several year examine overall finding study . The general consensus gabapentin anti-hyperalgesic opioid-sparing property may also reduce incidence postoperative nausea vomit [ 5 , 11-15 ] . Most research show gabapentin beneficial treatment postoperative pain , show neither positive negative effect . There evidence gabapentin detrimental pose risk postoperative patient . However , gabapentin specifically study bariatric surgery . Therefore , purpose study explore hypothesis perioperative gabapentin anti-hyperalgesic opioid-sparing property , thus increase patient comfort satisfaction decrease pain score reduce adverse effect opioids , postoperative nausea vomit . This randomized , double-blind placebo control study , perform adult laparoscopic gastric bypass patient come surgery morbid obesity . The major end-points analysis intraoperative postoperative opioid requirement incidence nausea vomit postoperative period .</detailed_description>
