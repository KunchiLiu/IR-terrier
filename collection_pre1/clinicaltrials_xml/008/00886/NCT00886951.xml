	<detailed_description>The adaptation image agent like 123-I MNI-388 123-I MNI-390 biomarkers β-amyloid deposition AD patient assess disease require human validation study . The purpose study develop characterize 123-I MNI-388 123-I MNI-390 objective biomarkers AD . The significance work lie apply state-of-art quantitative neuroimaging tool develop relevant biomarker live AD patient . In context propose investigate feasibility apply technique image biomarker disease AD patient . Informed consent obtain subject . All subject undergo screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation baseline cognitive evaluation . Subjects give bolus injection 123-I MNI-388 MNI 390 antecubital vein . Subjects undergo serial SPECT imaging scan serial venous plasma sample measurement 123-I MNI-388 MNI 390 plasma ( protein bound free ) period 8 hour . The quantitative visual imaging analysis perform image-processing specialist remain blind clinical information.including diagnosis . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express brain tissue plasma ratio radioligand , 123-I MNI-388 MNI-390 . Time peak uptake amplitude peak uptake evaluate brain region result AD patient control compare .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Alzheimer 's Subject Selection : subject clinical diagnosis mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease recruit study . The following criterion meet inclusion AD subject study : The participant 50 year old . Written inform consent obtain . Participants clinical diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease base National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke/Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ( NINCDS/ADRDA ) criterion . CDR score ≥0.5 &lt; 2 . Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale score ≤ 4 . For female , nonchild bear potential negative urine blood pregnancy test day 123I MNI388 123I MNI390 injection . Alzheimer 's subject exclude participation follow reason : The subject sign symptoms another neurodegenerative disease include Parkinson 's disease , diffuse Lewy body dementia , history significant cerebrovascular disease . The subject clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical psychiatric illness The subject disorder may interfere drug absorption distribution , metabolism , excretion ( include gastrointestinal surgery ) . The subject evidence clinically significant gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , hematological , neoplastic , endocrine , neurological , immunodeficiency , pulmonary , disorder disease . Clinically significant MRI evidence vascular disease alternative neurologic disorder Pregnancy Concomitant therapy : patient may remain stable dose anticholinesterase medication study . Use donepezil ( Aricept® ) , rivastigmine ( Exelon® ) , galantamine ( Razadyne® ) , tacrine ( Cognex® ) , memantine ( Namenda® ) permit study . Doses compound must stable 2 month prior study . At visit screen visit , investigator ask patient whether medication include OTC medication , take since previous visit . Use antipsychotics agitation benzodiazepine insomnia anxiety permit . However , use agent permit within 8 hour prior administration cognitive test . Healthy Control Subject Selection : Healthy control subject neurological disease recruit study . The following criterion meet inclusion healthy control subject study : The participant 50 year old . Written inform consent obtain . Negative history neurological psychiatric illness base evaluation research physician . CDR score 0 . For female , nonchild bear potential negative urine blood pregnancy test day 123I MNI388 123I MNI390 injection . Healthy control subject exclude participation follow reason : The subject clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical psychiatric illness . The subject disorder may interfere drug absorption distribution , metabolism , excretion ( include gastrointestinal surgery ) . The subject evidence clinically significant gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , hematological , neoplastic , endocrine , neurological , immunodeficiency , pulmonary , disorder disease . The subject participate another clinical study within previous 30 day . Pregnancy Clinically significant MRI evidence vascular disease neurologic disorder</criteria>
