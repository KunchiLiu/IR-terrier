	<brief_title>ACCS ( Amnion-derived Cellular Cytokine Solution ) Versus Standard Care In Treating Partial Thickness Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase I/II multi-center clinical trial perform 99 adult partial-thickness burn . Two similar partial-thickness burn area single patient select . One burn randomly assign receive either test drug ( ACCS ) normal saline one three treatment regimen . The three treatment arm : 1 . ACCS 0.01 mL/cm2 every 7th day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every 7th day ; 2 . ACCS 0.01 mL/cm2 every 4th day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every 4th day ; 3 . ACCS 0.01 mL/cm2 every day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every day . Two different preclinical study partial-thickness burn guinea pig demonstrate accelerated epithelialization topical treatment ACCS . Similarly , preclinical study Yorkshire pig demonstrate rapid maturity epithelialization well quality heal partial-thickness skin graft donor sit ACCS treatment . In preclinical study , ACCS give dose 0.01 mL/cm2 wind area appear saturate wound adequately without excess simultaneously improve heal . In preclinical toxicity study , dose 0.01 mL/cm2 show safe .</detailed_description>
