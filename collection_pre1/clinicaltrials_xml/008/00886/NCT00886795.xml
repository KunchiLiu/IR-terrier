Systemic lupus erythematosus ( meeting American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) ) criterion ; patient autoantibody ANA NOT exclude ) Lack peripheral venous access Drug , alcohol , chemical abuse within 6 month Pregnancy lactation woman must willing practice contraception study duration 3 month discontinue abatacept treatment . Sexually active woman childbearing potential must use effective method birth control course study , manner risk failure minimize . Prior study enrollment , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . In addition , men enrol study inform risk sexual partner childbearing potential counsel practice effective method birth control . All WOCBP must negative urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior first receive investigational product . If pregnancy test positive , subject exclude study . In addition , WOCBP instruct contact Investigator immediately suspect might pregnant ( e.g. , miss late menstrual period ) time study participation Investigator notify Bristol Myers Squibb ( BMS ) within 24 hour become aware confirmed pregnancy subject participate study . Women must agree practice adequate birth control minimum 3 month posttreatment .
