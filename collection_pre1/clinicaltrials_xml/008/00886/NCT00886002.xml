	<brief_summary>The primary objective pilot trial identify pain model ( ) allow ( ) compare differentiate analgesic effect transdermal fentanyl 25Âµg/h , transdermal fentanyl 12Âµg/h placebo dose dependent way . The second objective compare effect transdermal buprenorphine 35Âµg/h model effect two transdermal fentanyl dosage . Therefore four different treatment give ; treatment mean patch attach back 72 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After read sign write informed consent form , patient participate screen visit ( within 2 week study start , see selection study participant ) . Patients participate training session experience three pain test procedure assure whether able perform test willing accept stimulus study . They hospitalize 4 treatment cycle ( 4 day / 5 night 4 treatment mention 'Purpose Study ' give ) . Between hospitalization require come u . The new day -1 next cycle day week 2 week previous hospitalization . For treatment cycle enter facility evening ( day -1 ) patch administer may leave morning day 5 . Assessments make follow : Evening Day -1 : urine drug alcohol screen , pregnancy test female , interview study physician charge Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 morning : vital sign , pulsoximetry ( assessment oxygen saturation mean finger clip ) From Day 1 morning Day 5 morning : continuous ECG From Day 1 morning Day 4 morning : patch administration back Days 1 , 2 , 4 morning : three pain tests* , pupillometry ( measurement pupil size photographic device ) , blood sample measurement drug plasma concentration prior patch administration morning day 1 perform three pain tests* ( heat , cold pressure test , electric stimulation forearm ) ass baseline value skin check designated patch location . Patch adhesion check regularly administration . Patients ask regularly stay unit concomitant medication whether adverse event occur . In morning day 5 , dismission , physical exam perform . The skin underneath patch assess removal . After fourth hospitalisation phase leave facility return ambulant follow visit 6 - 9 day thereafter . Vital sign record , ask concomitant medication adverse event , physical exam , clinical laboratory , vital sign electrocardiogram perform . After visit study terminate . The electrical stimulation model use commercially available registered human use constant current device deliver wave pulse 3-s duration . Two electrode apply lateral low arm . To determine pain threshold ascend staircase design use start randomly vary stimulus . The intensity stimulus increase pain threshold reach afterwards increase maximally tolerate pain reach . Once pain threshold maximally tolerated stimulus identify , series stimulus evenly space stimulus 30 % less pain threshold maximally tolerate stimulus administer random fashion patient rate pain visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Heat test : A thermode apply forearm . The temperature thermode continuously increase 30 C maximum 56 C. They ask give signal perceiving heat painful press bottom feel heat intolerable pain want heat increase . Cold pressor test : The left hand immerse ice-saturated water maximum 2 min . If pain felt intolerable 2 min elapse , withdraw hand . Perceived pain intensity rat continuously 10 mm visual analogue scale record . Patients receive one four treatment one another : transdermal fentanyl 25 mcg/h , transdermal fentanyl 12 mcg/h , transdermal buprenorphine 35 mcg/h , placebo . All treatment administer patch . Treatment duration per patch 72 hour . After time patch remove . Before next patch follow treatment apply , 11 day without drug administration . Total duration study 56 day .</detailed_description>
