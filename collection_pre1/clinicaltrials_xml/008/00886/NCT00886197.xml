	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) common disorder Asia include erosive non-erosive counterpart . The evaluation intra-esophageal damage paramount importance patient erosive non-erosive GERD distinct manifestation prognosis . Although proton-pump inhibitor ( PPI ) treatment choice erosive patient excellent therapeutic response , majority reflux patient classify non-erosive reflux disease ( NERD ) .1 Not demonstrate favorable response PPI treatment pathogenesis NERD part associate psychosomatic pathways.2 Their therapeutic response PPI unpredictable . Therefore , improve diagnosis reflux-induced mucosal damage endoscopy worthwhile endeavor . Minimal change esophagitis commonly accept part spectrum reflux esophagitis Japan.3,4 This category define `` erythema without sharp demarcation , whitish turbidity , and/or invisibility vessel due finding '' .3 Although minimal change disease ( MCD ) recognize significant number patient reflux use endoscopy-first policy , major drawback category Los Angeles system due poor interobserver agreement ( κ statistic = 0.2 ) . Narrow-band imaging ( NBI ) novel , noninvasive optical technique adjusts reflect light improve contrast capillary pattern compare conventional illumination.5 This system highly applicable detection early-stage mucosal lesion , include oral cancer , Barrett 's esophagus , gastric cancer , colonic neoplasm.6-10 For reflux patient face daily basis , NBI system proven improve intraobserver interobserver reproducibility grade esophagitis small erosive focus ( improve overall κ value 0.62 versus 0.45 ) .11 Corresponding crowd capillary , inflame mucosal break appear dark brown NBI , produce intense contrast normal squamous epithelium stomach mucosa . These property may improve ability delineate margin small inflammatory focus . Based advantage , plausibly hypothesize use system may improve description MCD enable prediction therapeutic response PPI . Testing hypothesis main goal study . Aim Study To assess clinical utility therapeutic implication NBI evaluate reflux patient minimal mucosal damage .</detailed_description>
