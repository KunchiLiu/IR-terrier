	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bevacizumab everolimus may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether bevacizumab effective give together without everolimus treat ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study bevacizumab see well work give without everolimus treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without Everolimus Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare progression-free survival hazard ratio patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer treat bevacizumab v without everolimus . Secondary - To determine nature degree toxicity regimen . - To compare progression-free overall survival patient measurable disease v detectable ( non-measurable ) disease . - To estimate proportion patient measurable disease objective tumor response treatment . - To provide descriptive information CA-125 response regimen , possible , objective tumor response . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord platinum-free interval ( ≤ 182 day vs &gt; 182 day ) , measurable disease status ( measurable v non-measurable `` detectable '' disease ) , prior treatment bevacizumab/aflibercept ( vs yes ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . - Arm II : Patients receive bevacizumab arm I oral placebo daily day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
