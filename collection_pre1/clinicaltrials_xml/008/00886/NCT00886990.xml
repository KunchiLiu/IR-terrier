	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Single Versus Double Ritonavir-Boosted Protease Inhibitor ( PI ) -Based Antiretroviral Therapy ( ART ) Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 50,620 Thai child diagnose HIV infection Thailand 1988 2005 , 20,000 still living.1 The production generic ART Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organization ( GPO ) , begin 2002 give Thai Government ability offer highly active antiretroviral therapy children.2 As June 2006 , 6000 child receive ART within government program , estimate another 1500 child receive care private sector.1 The Thai National Access Care program provide two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) one NNRTI first-line regimen choice . The commonly used regimen GPO-vir S , show acceptable pharmacokinetic parameters3 excellent treatment outcome4 . A study 107 child NNRTI-based treatment , include half GPO-vir S , show despite low baseline CD4 3 % high viral load 5.4 log , child excellent virological response , 76 % HIV RNA 50 copies/ml week 72.4 In another study 192 child advance HIV disease , hospitalization rate decrease 31 % first six month 2 % three year HAART . The mortality rate decrease 6 % first six month HAART le 1 % that.5 Nevertheless , Thailand face grow number child experience failure NNRTI-based regimens 20 % expect fail base publish literature4 , 6 . This could result 1000 Thai child need change therapy new future . Therefore , urgent need find appropriate second line treatment . Developed develop country guideline recommend regimens single PI plus low-dose ritonavir boosting ( boosted PI ) combination 2 NRTIs adult child fail NNRTI-based treatments.6-8 There limit data antiviral efficacy boost PI second line treatment follow failure PI-sparing first line regimen . As success second line PI regimens PI-experienced patient depend heavily number PI mutation present9 , 10 , reasonable assume NNRTI failures without PI mutation , patient well . However , also depend number active NRTIs use second line regimen . Meta-analysis show NNRTI failure tend associate NRTI mutation PI failures.11 This particularly true develop country switch second line therapy usually occur late virological failure , patient show sign clinical and/or CD4 failure.12 A high likelihood multi-NRTI resistance couple limited NRTIs choice render second line regimens less active . In circumstance , unclear effective single boost PI recycle NRTIs second line treatment would . Therefore , double boost PIs without NRTIs propose second line option 2007 Ministry Public Health Treatment Guidelines child HIV infection.13 The pharmacokinetic enhancement 2 different PIs low-dose ritonavir offer unique benefit maintain high genetic barrier resistance . There choices second-line therapy child . Lopinavir/ritonavir PI choice ritonavir-co-formulated drug liquid PI . It also excellent efficacy trial single-boosted PI children.14 , 15 Indinavir commonly use PI Thailand least expensive PI . Plipat N , et al . show evidence support efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics low dose 230-300 mg/m2 indinavir boost ritonavir use combination 2NRTIs Thai children.16 The efficacy double boost PI , saquinavir/lopinavir/ritonavir , investigate 50 child NRTI/NNRTI failure . The regimen effective : 80 % 60 % HIV RNA 400 50 copies/ml respectively week 48 . However , regimen burdensome large pill size , occurrence hyperlipidaemia 44 % child week 48 cause concern 17 , 18 Fortunately , fail child find PI mutations.19 A small study Caucasian adult use regimen also show good efficacy.20</detailed_description>
