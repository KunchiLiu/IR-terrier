	<brief_summary>Treatment chronic pain major clinical challenge since chronic pain frequent lead deterioration quality life . An injury wind lead long term change nervous system make skin sensitive near injury ; term hyperalgesia occur long term depotentiation ( LTP ) , i.e. , change synaptic interaction neuron . Opioids gold standard symptomatic therapy moderate severe pain . Now , animal study investigator discover previously unrecognized effect opioids . Intradermal injection capsaicin ( injection pepper extract skin ) establish pain model human . The investigator want test influence remifentanil , ultra-short act opioid , hyperalgesia observe intradermal capsaicin human volunteer double blind cross-over prospective active placebo control clinical trial .</brief_summary>
