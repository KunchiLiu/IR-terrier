	<brief_summary>The prevalence severely obese child rise . Behavioral therapy weight loss successful , others need aggressive approach drug therapy . In addition , 25 % severely obese child impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , place significantly elevate risk develop type 2 diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease . Although various drug therapy weight loss IGT explore adult , evaluate child . Recently , new drug class emerge target deficiencies GLP-1 . One main glycemic mechanism action GLP-1 agonist exenatide enhance glucose disposal postprandial set improve glucose tolerance . In addition , exenatide induce weight loss decrease appetite slow gastric motility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , control , crossover clinical trial 12 patient . All patient receive exenatide undergo control phase . Following baseline test , participant randomly assign treatment order : therapy ( exenatide ) control ( lifestyle modification ) . Half ( n = 6 ) receive exenatide first ( 3-months ) cross control ( drug therapy 3-months ) . Half ( n = 6 ) assign control first ( 3-months ) cross exenatide ( 3-months ) . All effort make stratify randomization base gender participant . Treatment control condition three month . Because route administration exenatide ( subcutaneous injection ) , placebo utilized control phase study . Participants study engage background intensive lifestyle modification offer University Minnesota Pediatric Weight Management Clinic entire study , even active drug treatment phase . Intensive lifestyle modification purely clinical nature child family receive continue counsel team train professional include physician , dietician , psychologist reduce weight make healthy eat choice increase physical activity . The screening visit take place Pediatric Weight Management Clinic include complete medical history physical examination . Screening include review medical record previous clinical laboratory data ( include clinically-ordered glucose tolerance test result ) . All research test take place University Minnesota General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . Subjects undergo test follow interval : baseline , immediately first 3-month phase ( whether exenatide control ) , immediately second 3- month phase ( whether exenatide control ) . The following measure collect subject fast least twelve hour : - Height , weight , body mass index , waist hip circumference - Fat lean mass ( dual energy x-ray absorptiometry : DXA ) - Tanner stage determination ( perform screen physical exam may obtain medical chart ) - Fasting lipid profile ( total- , LDL- , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride ) - Systolic diastolic blood pressure - Oral glucose tolerance test ( glucose insulin measure every 30 minute 2 hour ) - Endothelial function ( digital reactive hyperemia : EndoPAT 2000 , Itamar Medical ) - addition baseline measure , endothelial function test occur hour one two oral glucose tolerance test - Frozen plasma storage - addition baseline blood draw , blood endothelial biomarkers obtain hour one two oral glucose tolerance test - Arterial stiffness ( pulse wave velocity ; augmentation index : Sphygmocor , AtCor Medical ) - Frozen plasma pharmacokinetic determination exenatide child</detailed_description>
