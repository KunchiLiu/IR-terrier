	<brief_summary>Trachoma , ocular infection cause C. trachomatis , second lead infectious cause blindness worldwide . Years repeat infection C. trachomatis cause eyelid scar contract ultimately rotate inward eyelash rub eyeball abrade cornea ( trichiasis ) . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) endorse multi-faceted strategy combat trachoma include surgery repair lid distort trachoma ( trichiasis ) imminent danger vision loss . Current evidence suggest long-term success rate trichiasis surgery less optimal due variation surgical technique . Previous research study team demonstrate short incision higher rate trichiasis recurrence . In addition , observation team 's oculoplastic surgeon lead hypothesis granuloma formation lid contour abnormality may result current surgical practice . The objective study compare outcomes trichiasis surgery perform newly develop trachomatous trichiasis ( TT ) clamp versus surgery follow standard technique ( bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure BTRP ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Field observation 2005 study 's PI oculoplastic surgeon reveal significant departure current trichiasis surgery procedure ( bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure BTRP ) , describe WHO manual , `` Trichiasis Surgery Trachoma-the Bilamellar Tarsal Rotation Procedure '' . These procedural departure felt contribute adverse outcome , include trichiasis recurrence , granuloma formation lid contour abnormality . This study team develop new surgical tool , TT clamp , help improve surgical outcome follow BTRP . A randomized , single-masked clinical trial implement Mtwara region Tanzania . Study participant randomize 1:1 basis surgery TT clamp surgery standard BTR equipment . All surgery take place surgical center Mtwara Lindi 8-month period . Baseline assessment severity trichiasis predictor surgical failure carry prior surgery . Follow-up plan 2 week ( suture removal ) , 6 week , 12 month , 24 month post-surgery . At follow-up visit participant assess evidence unfavorable outcome , include trichiasis recurrence , granuloma formation , lid contour abnormality . All outcome assess clinically train observer mask intervention status .</detailed_description>
