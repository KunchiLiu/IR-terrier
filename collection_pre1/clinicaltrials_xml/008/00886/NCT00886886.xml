	<brief_summary>MDMA release dopamine , serotonin , norepinephrine brain . Serotonin uptake inhibitor show interact 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) decrease psychoactive cardiovascular stimulant effect . This finding indicate MDMA act part release serotonin serotonin uptake site . However , vitro study show MDMA bind potently norepinephrine uptake site serotonin dopamine uptake transporter . In addition , norepinephrine uptake site blocker antidepressant drug attenuate behavioral effect MDMA animal . These preclinical data indicate norepinephrine may also contribute response MDMA human . To test hypothesis study evaluate interact effect selective norepinephrine transporter inhibitor reboxetine subjective cardiovascular stimulant effect MDMA healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study use randomize double-blind cross-over design four experimental session . Reboxetine ( 8 mg ) placebo administer night experimental session 1 h administration MDMA ( 125 mg ) placebo 16 healthy volunteer . Subjective cardiovascular response plasma sample pharmacokinetics repeatedly assess throughout experiment . We hypothesize highly selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor reboxetine attenuate subjective especially heart rate blood pressure responses MDMA . Such result would indicate norepinephrine critically involved pharmacology MDMA may provide helpful use development treatment Ecstasy intoxication .</detailed_description>
