	<detailed_description>Our specific aim develop pilot test two intervention lead least 30 % individual depression present primary care engage Internet-based depression support group . We identify primary care patient depression state access Internet willing consider treatment currently treatment depression . In primary care office give one three intervention introduce Internet depression support group site . Patients randomize three experimental group : 1 ) simple card name web address ; 2 ) 8 '' x11 '' paper screen shot Internet site home page , list feature provide site , two patient story describe Internet site help ; 3 ) 8 '' x11 '' announcement ( intervention 2 ) plus endorsement site primary care provider . The last two intervention also ask patient provide email address one email reminder sent . The major outcome access depression Internet support group least follow four week . The result study provide important information whether possible recruit substantial proportion primary care patient engage potentially useful inexpensive addition standard depression care . If possible , likelihood successfully complete RCT effectiveness depression Internet support group utilize primary care patient would low . Researchers try assess effectiveness depression Internet support group would go alternative design recruit patient depression try join depression Internet support group randomize delay join group . We also use study learn patient characteristic associate engage internet depression support group . While focus study Psychobabble , intent study explore ease referral , predictor use participant experience may relate general concept Internet-based social support . Specific AIM 1 : We believe participant randomize either 8 x 11 '' brochure recommendation primary care physician likely visit use site receive recommendation card ( 50 % versus 35 % versus 10 % ) . We hypothesize great level encouragement/recommendation associate high level internet site usage . A sample size 225 ( N-110 University Chicago N=115 Johns Hopkins ) power 0.8 detect difference either card group brochure physician recommendation group . Specific Aim 2 : We believe high self-efficacy great level trust primary care physician likely visit site one time . We conduct logistic regression analysis determine whether base self-efficacy great level trust predict use internet site adjust group assignment . We hypothesize high level self-efficacy physician trust associate great internet site use . Will believe total N=225 sufficient evaluate relationship 10 independent variable outcome site usage ( &lt; 15 cells/variable ) . Specific Aim 3 : We determine internet base social support group acceptable feasible primary care patient . Specifically , evaluate whether internet site increase knowledge , motivation , depression treatment ( Change level agreement regard `` accepting doctor diagnosis depression '' , strongly disagree 1 , strongly agree 5 ) . We hypothesize level agreement increase pre post-study . A sample size 225 ( N=110 University Chicago N=115 Johns Hopkins ) power 0.8 detect difference agree ( 4 ) pre-study ( 5 ) strongly agree post study . Specific Aim 4 : We believe social support knowledge gain internet may influence subsequent care seek cop behavior . Specifically , evaluate whether sought care adopt cop skill 6 week study entry . We hypothesize behavior increase pre post study . A sample size 225 ( N=110 University Chicago N=115 Johns Hopkins ) power 0.8 detect difference treatment participation pre-study 0.4 versus 0.65 post study . Specific Aim 5 : We believe social support knowledge gain internet site lead change behavior may result low level depress mood . Specifically , compare level depress mood baseline 6 week follow-up . We hypothesize modest decline depress mood pre study baseline post study . A sample size 225 ( N=110 University Chicago N=115 Johns Hopkins ) power 0.8 detect difference treatment participation pre study CES-D score 24 post study score 20 .</detailed_description>
