	<brief_title>A Study Sunitinib Recurrent and/or Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Salivary Glands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label phase II study sunitinib malate patient recurrent and/or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) major minor salivary gland origin . Sunitinib novel , multi-targeted small molecule inhibitor receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) , include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFs ) , platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFRs ) stem cell factor receptor ( KIT ) , involve tumour proliferation angiogenesis . VEGF expression associate clinically disease prognosis many different type cancer number study suggest VEGF may play important role pathogenicity ACC . Sunitinib expect inhibit PDGF- VEGF-driven angiogenesis , consequence , limit solid tumour growth.This study determine anti-tumour activity sunitinib ACC salivary gland use objective response rate ( partial complete response ) primary objective .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologic cytologic adenoid cystic carcinoma major minor salivary gland origin . Patients must recurrent and/or metastatic disease progressive amenable surgery curative radiotherapy occur within 6 month study entry : least 20 % increase radiologically clinically measurable disease ; appearance new lesion deterioration clinical status Patients must measurable disease , least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients prior therapy least 4 week ' interval chemotherapy ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) , radiotherapy surgery study enrollment . Exceptions may make low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy . Patients must 18 year age older . Life expectancy great 12 week . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/μL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/μL platelet &gt; 100,000/μL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal amylase/lipase within normal institutional limit creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure ECHO MUGA scan . Patients must QTc &lt; 500 msec baseline ECG . Patients New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II cardiac function : history Class II heart failure asymptomatic treatment prior anthracycline exposure receive central thoracic radiation include heart radiotherapy port . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . At least 4 week must elapse since major surgery . Patients receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition sunitinib . Patients QTc prolongation significant ECG abnormality . Patients poorly control hypertension . Patients require use therapeutic dos coumarinderivative anticoagulant warfarin , although dos 2 mg daily permit prophylaxis thrombosis . Note : Low molecular weight heparin permit provided patient 's PT INR &lt; 1.5 . Patients condition impairs ability swallow retain sunitinib tablet . Patients follow condition : Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 28 day treatment . Any history cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within 12 month prior study entry . History myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , stable/unstable angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft stenting within 12 month prior study entry . History pulmonary embolism within past 12 month . Class III IV heart failure define NYHA . Patients take medication potent inducer inhibitor CYP3A4 liver enzyme ( unless deem acceptable Principal Investigator ) . Patients preexist thyroid abnormality unable maintain thyroid function normal range medication . Patients know brain metastasis . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman . Breastfeeding discontinue mother treated sunitinib . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy Patients take medication may cause QTc prolongation unless require washout period meet .</criteria>
