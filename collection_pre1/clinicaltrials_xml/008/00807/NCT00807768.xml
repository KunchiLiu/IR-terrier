	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study pelvic radiation therapy see well work compare vaginal implant radiation therapy , paclitaxel , carboplatin treat patient high-risk stage I stage II endometrial cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Implant radiation therapy use radioactive material place directly near tumor kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether pelvic radiation therapy alone effective vaginal implant radiation therapy , paclitaxel , carboplatin treat patient endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine treatment vaginal cuff brachytherapy follow three cycle chemotherapy reduces rate recurrence death ( i.e . increase recurrence-free survival ) compare pelvic radiation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare survival two treatment group . II . To compare patterns failure two treatment group . III . To compare physical functioning , fatigue neurotoxicity two treatment group . IV . To examine association primary comorbid illnesses obesity survival , fatigue physical functioning . V. To evaluate psychometric property ( construct validity , reliability , sensitivity treatment responsiveness time ) Patient-Reported-Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Fatigue Short form 1 , evaluate fatigue measurement equivalence woman endometrial cancer age-matched woman general United States ( US ) population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability gene expression signatures early stage endometrial cancer predict recurrence explore association gene expression signatures early stage endometrial cancer clinical characteristic outcome . II . To bank whole blood specimens future research . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo conventional intensity-modulated pelvic radiation therapy daily , 5 day week , 5-6 week ( total 25-28 fraction ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stage II disease stage I disease confirmed diagnosis clear cell and/or papillary serous histology may also undergo 1 2 intravaginal ( i.e. , vaginal cuff ) brachytherapy boost treatment . ARM II : Patients undergo vaginal cuff brachytherapy comprise 3-5 high-dose rate brachytherapy treatment approximately 2 week 1 2 low-dose rate brachytherapy treatment 1-2 day . Beginning within 3 week initiate brachytherapy , patient receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Chemotherapy repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter 5 year .</detailed_description>
