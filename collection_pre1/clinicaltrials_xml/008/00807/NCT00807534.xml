	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cycle and/or treadmill exercise modality may adequately reflect constraint physical activity daily live may easily transfer primary care set . Thus , alternative need consider . The use continuous shuttle walk test one several specify constant walking pace assessment exertional dyspnea yet develop . Since walk basic movement locomotion everyday life , seem appropriate examine use walk test . In addition walking , one frequent exercise constraint everyday life lie fact climb stair . The step test methodology however specifically focused measurement exertional dyspnea carry patient COPD . There good rationale development step test evaluation exertional dyspnea exercise tolerance primary care setting : ( ) simple , inexpensive equipment require little storage space , ( ii ) ability externally dictate work intensity use time device metronome regulate step speed , ( iii ) exercise consistent everyday activity know important dyspnea stimulus ( i.e . stair climb , hill walk ) , ( iv ) use large muscle group ensure ventilation increase support work muscle , resultant increase dyspnea patient reduce ventilatory capacity . GENERAL OBJECTIVE : The general purpose investigator-driven initiative develop simple exercise test assess effect pharmacological rehabilitation intervention exertional dyspnea primary care set . METHODS : The study require five visit research centre . The first visit include pulmonary function test incremental shuttle walk test characterize functional capacity participant . Patients also familiarize exercise test ( step walk ) . The goal familiarization reduce learn effect typically occur individual completes endurance test several time . During follow four visit , patient complete total four exercise test : two 3-min constant rate step test two 3-min constant rate shuttle walk . Each test precede nebulization either placebo 500 ug ipratropium bromide ( Atrovent ) . The placebo medication administer 1 hour prior begin test . The study follow crossover design , patient serve his/her control . The order endurance test ( step walk ) randomize . Finally , medication ( placebo ipratropium ) administer randomize , double-blind fashion . The exercise test supervise someone unaware medication administer order maintain blinding study . Data analysis : Responsiveness evaluate change dyspnea Borg score completion 3-min constant rate step test 3-min constant rate walk test placebo ipratropium bromide exercise . Paired test use evaluate difference end-exercise dyspnea ipratropium placebo condition two form exercise . We also calculate Standardized Response Mean ( SRM ) , e.g. , mean change dyspnea Borg score divide standard deviation ( SD ) mean change . A SRM value 0.5 suggest large change . Bronchodilator-induced change E , O2 , CO2 , heart rate compare 3-min constant rate step test 3-min constant rate walk test . Comparisons do use repeated measure design ( ANOVA ) . Significance level set p value 0.05 .</detailed_description>
