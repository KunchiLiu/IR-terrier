	<brief_title>Select Stim : Selective Stimulation Subthalamic Nucleus Parkinson 's Disease . `` A Feasibility Study ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson disease ( PD ) common neurodegenerative disorder , characterize motor symptom . Patients initially treat successfully drug ( e.g . levodopa ) , unfortunately use limit due severe side effect . In advanced stage PD neurosurgical treatment next therapeutic option . As result dopamine depletion PD subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) display characteristic burst activity . This burst activity result dysregulation electrical activity cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry express Parkinsonian symptom . That STN main target deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) PD . Long-term follow-up ( since 1993 ) show long lasting beneficial effect motor function PD patient . Despite beneficial motor effect important negative side-effects STN DBS . These include cognitive affective change stimulation , 40 % one side effect . 10 % experience difficulty daily function due alter cognition personality change . Presently , underlie mechanism stimulation induce behavioral change fully understand therefore adequate treatment lacking . The STN divide three functionally anatomically segregate part : motor part , cognitive part limbic part . Our hypothesis change cognition behavior STN DBS related stimulation non-motor part STN . Currently , good candidate exclude STN DBS high risk behavioral disorder . Objective study : The primary objective avoid cognitive affective side effect maintain beneficial motor effect selective stimulation STN motor part . With Select Stim project want improve classical operation procedure , way behavioral side effect less present motor symptom disease treat . In late stage , want compare classical treatment comparison new method . The outcome interested Parkinson symptom , also side effect stimulation cognitive functioning , mood behavior . The main objective feasibility study measure patient burden test technical feasibility . The feasibility study answer follow : target subthalamic nucleus , use stimulation motor cortex registration subthalcami nucleus technically achievable ? The primary goal determine technical feasibility patient tolerance . If method technical achievable well tolerated patient , want give answer main question randomize trial . Study design : The first stage consist feasibility study . Five patient enrol evaluate . Blinding randomization necessary . Depending result minor feasibility study , proceed second stage , randomize control trial . Study population : For study population consist PD patient candidate STN DBS : clinical finding consistent idiopathic PD suffer severe response fluctuation and/or dyskinesia , despite optimal drug treatment . Further , restriction term gender ethnicity . Age limit 40 75 years.Those PD patient suffer severe psychiatric co-morbidities cognitive decline exclude . Other exclusion criterion classical STN DBS operation . For feasibility study three patient enrol . Intervention ( applicable ) : The intervention expansion classical STN DBS procedure . The target use multichannel registration system stimulation motor cortex registration subthalamic nucleus add procedure . For procedure , necessary place subdural strip skull . Primary study parameters/outcome study : There two main endpoint measure feasibility . First , patient burden outcome . We interview patient ask fill standardize questionnaire . Only burden acceptable , start main study ( average mark test must 5 continue RCT ) . Thereby motor symptom must significantly less pronounced stimulation pre-operatively . Secondly , technical feasibility depend possibility register potential , evoke motor cortex stimulation STN ( so-called evoke potential ) . These potential clearly identifiable order recognize motor part STN . This necessary final study want compare result selective stimulation motor part STN result classical procedure . Secundary study parameters/outcome study ( applicable ) : Cognition , particular impulsivity , affect , assess neuropsychological test self-report questionnaire , Positive Negative Affect Scale ( Watson et al 1988 ) . Neuropsychological test cover main cognitive domain study parameter related performance task relevant domain executive functioning , include word fluency , Stroop ( Lezak , 2004 ) , finger precuing task ( Adam et al , 2002 ) Iowa Gambling Task ( Bechera et al. , 1994 ) . ( These endpoint feasibility trial . ) Advantage fMRI TMS double contrast MRI planning OR . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness ( applicable ) : The burden patient rest within lengthened operation time pre-operative preparation . The preparation study contain functional MRI . The patient need lie scanner prolonged time ( max . 30 min. ) . And TMS perform localise hand area motor cortex , take 60 minute . This test painful . The operation lengthen one hour per side . Adverse event related implantation subdural strip electrode motor cortex stimulation describe epilepsy research strip also use . The important complication involve bleeding , infection , transient neurological deficit , intracranial hypertension , seizure . A large retrospective study ( 185 patient epilepsy implantation subdural strip ) show strip electrode implantation rarely associated complication , e.g . epidural hematoma 1.6 % , subdural hematoma 1.1 % , brain edema 1.1 % , postoperative infection 1.1 % , transient aphasia 1.1 % , occurrence non-habitual seizure 2.7 % . Most published complication context prolong ( e.g . several day ) monitor epilepsy treatment . We expect risk seizure low Parkinson disease patient . Moreover , study subdural strip use hour record stimulation motor cortex . So , risk various complication mention probably even low . The strip implant burr hole five depth electrode implant like classical procedure . Only appear impossible procedure , second burr hole make . The risk ( bleed infection ) low ( le 0.25 % ) . The risk seizures small administration diphantoin . The important side effect diphantoin nausea , vomit , obstipation anorexia , also dizziness ataxia , nystagmus , speech disturbance , tremor , apathy , visual disturbance , nervosity , hallucination neuropathy . The adverse effect mainly report long term treatment . After intravenous administration hypotension occur cardiotoxic reaction , collaps and/ central depression ; incidentally dyskinesias . The injection site hurt , show inflammation necrosis skin . The diphantoin load safe time spam ( 90min ) safe intravenous line anesthetist srugery room .</detailed_description>
