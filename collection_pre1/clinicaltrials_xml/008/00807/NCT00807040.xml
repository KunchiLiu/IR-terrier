	<brief_summary>People coronary artery disease ( CAD ) people heart attack may develop leak mitral valve heart may therefore need undergo surgery fix valve . The best way fix mitral valve remain undetermined . This study evaluate whether good people severe mitral valve leakage undergo mitral valve replacement procedure mitral valve repair procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Effectiveness Repairing Versus Replacing Heart 's Mitral Valve People With Severe Chronic Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CAD occur artery supply blood heart become block result plaque buildup . In severe case , CAD cause chest pain , shortness breath , heart attack . After heart attack , people may develop leak mitral valve heart . This condition know ischemic mitral regurgitation ( IMR ) , cause blood flow backward heart . If leave untreated , severe IMR lead heart failure serious heart rhythm irregularity , know arrhythmia . People severe mitral valve leakage routinely undergo one two surgical procedure fix mitral valve : mitral valve repair procedure , surgical ring use repair valve ; mitral valve replacement procedure , damage valve replace new one . Currently , consensus medical community procedure beneficial . The purpose study determine whether people severe mitral valve regurgitation undergo mitral valve repair procedure mitral valve replacement procedure . This study enroll people CAD severe mitral regurgitation . At baseline study visit , participant undergo physical examination ; blood collection ; neurocognitive test ; questionnaire regard medical history , medication history , quality life . In operating room , participant randomly assign undergo either mitral valve repair procedure mitral valve replacement procedure . Blood , urine , tissue sample may collect participant surgery ; optional do prior approval participant . All participant attend study visit Day 30 Months 6 , 12 , 24 . At visit , participant take part medication history review , physical examination , echocardiogram , cardiopulmonary exercise test , neurocognitive test , quality life survey .</detailed_description>
