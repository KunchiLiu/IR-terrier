	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine percentage patient non-small cell lung cancer experience shrinkage tumor follow treatment three medication give together : paclitaxel , pemetrexed ( Alimta® ) , bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) . Each medication approve FDA patient receive treatment lung cancer . This study design study effect three drug give time . Each medication study lung cancer commercially available . Paclitaxel pemetrexed traditional chemotherapy drug . Bevacizumab monoclonal antibody , mean attache specific target . Bevacizumab attach protein blood stream call Vascular Endothelial GrowthFactor ( VEGF ) . VEGF help tumor grow new blood vessel fee , bevacizumab think help block new growth blood vessel starve tumor nutrient need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel , Bevacizumab Pemetrexed Patients With Untreated , Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Web-Based Data Collection , Patient Self-Reporting Adverse Effects Automated Response Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical trial , also study thing . We want learn manage side effect patient may develop chemotherapy . Cancer patient may develop side effect treatment , nausea , pain , fatigue , diarrhea , constipation , shortness breath . These symptom may due cancer , due treatment like chemotherapy drug radiation therapy . Doctors nurse often ask patient symptom , important part cancer treatment make patient feel well possible . If patient feel well , may need change way treat prescribe therapy decrease symptom . The best way find patient feeling ask directly . We interested develop new way ask patient feel , use Internet . A special new website call STAR ( `` Symptom Tracking Reporting Patients '' ) develop help patient record information , doctor nurse review clinic appointment . This study design help u see STAR helpful way u keep track information patient ' symptom quality life . As part study , computerize ( automate ) technique determine size patient tumor ( ) treatment use . This test past found accurate . The automated technique determine tumor size use routine CT scan patient part study . This automate method measure tumor ( ) allow u know sooner whether drug treatment cause disease shrink . The information STAR automate tumor measurement go placed secure Internet site . This provide doctor information need determine drug combination work patient whether continue study . Also , tumor sample biopsy do past , analyze protein may present lung cancer .</detailed_description>
