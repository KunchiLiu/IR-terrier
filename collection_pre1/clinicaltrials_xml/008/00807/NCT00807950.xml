	<brief_summary>We hypothesize Simvastatin administration would result selective killing basal subtype breast cancer , particular , CD44+/CD24- breast cancer cell primary tumor . We hypothesize tumor genomic change would correlate tumor response Simvastatin . We also look correlate Simvastatin biological effect expression pattern initial status primary tumor . In addition , hypothesize Simvastatin-induced tumor gene expression change may correlate tumor plasma proteomics , peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression change , pharmacogenetics , analysis may refine selection patient likely benefit Simvastatin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Simvastatin Primary Breast Cancer ; Test Its Potential Selectivity Basal Subtype Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1 . Evaluate biological response ( proliferation apoptosis ) Simvastatin primary breast cancer . 2 . Evaluate cell type specificity Simvastatin effect basal subtype breast cancer , especially cell CD44+/CD24- immunophenotype primary tumor . Secondary objective 1 . To study cellular response Simvastatin transriptome . 2 . To obtain gene expression signature predict Simvastatin biological effect . 3 . To identify genetic polymorphism may influence Simvastatin pharmacokinetics and/or biological effect breast cancer . 4 . To correlate tumor plasma proteomics tumor gene expression change , identify tumor and/or serum protein marker predict Simvastatin biological effect . 5 . To correlate peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression change tumor gene expression change , identify blood gene marker may predict Simvastatin biological effect . VI . Abstract Research Proposal In 300 word , describe concisely specific aim , hypothesis , methodology approach application , indicate appropriate application 's importance science medicine . The abstract must self-contained serve succinct accurate description application separate . Please use lay term . If possible , technical medical term explain simple language . We hypothesize Simvastatin administration would result selective killing basal subtype breast cancer , particular , CD44+/CD24- breast cancer cell primary tumor . We hypothesize tumor genomic change would correlate tumor response Simvastatin . We also look correlate Simvastatin biological effect expression pattern initial status primary tumor . In addition , hypothesize Simvastatin-induced tumor gene expression change may correlate tumor plasma proteomics , peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression change , pharmacogenetics , analysis may refine selection patient likely benefit Simvastatin . This single-centre , open-label , phase II study Simvastatin resectable primary breast cancer . A total 100 patient measurable , resectable , primary breast tumor enrol receive 10-21 day Simvastatin dose 20 mg daily definitive breast cancer surgery . Pre-treatment tumor biopsy obtain subject start Simvastatin . Subjects take Simvastatin dose 20 mg daily 10-21 day , prior definitive breast cancer surgery . The post-treatment tumor biopsy obtain surgery . At tumor biopsy , 3-4 tumor sample obtain needle track . One tumor core time point fix formalin histological examination immunohistochemical study . The remain tumor core store liquid nitrogen subsequent RNA protein extraction gene expression proteomics study . Blood sample obtain 10-21 day Simvastatin treatment Simvastatin pharmacokinetic analysis , plasma proteomics peripheral mononuclear cell gene expression analysis . 10 ml blood take participant genotyping study .</detailed_description>
