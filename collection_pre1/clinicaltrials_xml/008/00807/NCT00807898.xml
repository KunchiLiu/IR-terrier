	<detailed_description>Preventing cervical cancer public health concern . Since 2006 quadrivalent vaccine young woman nine twenty six year age available protect human papillomavirus ( HPV ) prevent type cervical cancer ( Gardasil ) . The vaccine important health promotion tool address widespread prevalence HPV cervical cancer , eligible young woman receive vaccine . The vaccine effective administer young woman sexual debut . When vaccine give young woman le 18 year age , parental permission require . This permission usually provide young woman 's mother . Understanding predictor mother 's decision minor daughter receive HPV vaccine inform intervention seek increase number young woman receive vaccine . Health behavior theory , Theory Planned Behavior ( TPB ) , indicate factor mechanisms predict health promotion decision activity . TPB provide direct statistical model variable relate health behavior measure evaluated , use guide propose study . The study focus mother adolescent daughter 13-17 year age . The normative change realignments parent child relationship arrive onset adolescence , coincide great adolescence behavioral autonomy , influence parental decision related adolescent . Thus , expand TPB include influence adolescent mother 's decision daughter receive HPV vaccine . Hypothesis : We hypothesize Expanded Theory Planned Behavior explain mother 's decision choose HPV vaccine daughter . Research Questions : RSQ1 : What TPB variables predict mother 's decision choose HPV vaccine daughter ? RSQ2 : What variables predict strength daughter 's influence mother 's decision choose HPV vaccine daughter ? RSQ3 : What relationships mother ' daughter ' score variable relate decision choose HPV vaccine ? RSQ4 : How mother daughter choose receive HPV vaccine differ descriptively mother daughter choose receive HPV vaccine ? Data analyze use path analysis , multiple regression , analysis variance . The model demonstrate multiple potential influence mother 's decision choose HPV vaccine daughter , influence potential target family teach intervention tailor social marketing . Further study need determine well model applies various family type diverse culture nationality .</detailed_description>
