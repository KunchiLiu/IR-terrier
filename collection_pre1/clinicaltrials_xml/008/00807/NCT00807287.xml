The endoscopic technique yield success rate 90 98 % correct jejunal placement . However , require endoscopic equipment trained staff . In contrast small uncontrolled trial different unguided technique result success rate 75 % , . In prospective randomize trial success rate correct jejunal placement endoscopic technique compare unguided frictional technique .

	<brief_title>Evaluation Two Methods Jejunal Placement Enteral Feeding Tubes Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artificial nutrition important link response injury recovery critically ill patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) Therefore artificial nutrition become part ICU standard-therapy . Enteral nutrition ( EN ) show superior total parenteral nutrition . Consequently , EN first choice patient without contraindication enteral feeding . However , although EN beneficial patient may also associate complication gastroduodenal motility disorder , common critically ill patient , especially receive analgosedation . Clinical study show 62,8 % patient receive EN gastrointestinal complication like high gastric residual ( ≥200ml ) , vomit , abdominal distension regurgitation . These complication lead interruption EN , result low caloric intake patient . In order avoid least complication American Society Chest Physicians consensus statement recommend small bowel feed gastric residual volume 150ml high occur . The Canadian clinical practice guideline recommend acceptance gastric residual volume 250 ml , use prokinetic agent jejunal feeding patient , high risk intolerance EN ( inotropes , sedative , paralytic agent . Small bowel feed best method feed patient enterally associate significant decrease reflux , reduce risk aspiration adequate caloric intake . For small bowel feed placement jejunal feeding tube necessary . There several possibility place tube small bowel . An excellent method endoscopy , success rate 98 % moreover allow evaluation upper GI-tract concerning pathology . However rather time consume procedure , limited availability require trained staff . As simple alternative unguided tube , place small bowel test show success rate 75 % . Different patient population different severity illness ICU patient mislead develop difference success rate . So far prospective randomise trial compare endoscopic method versus unguided frictional placement study . Therefore aim study evaluation success rate jejunal placement two different method comparative ICU patient population . The secondary outcome parameter : time successful placement , time place , cost complication . We hypothesize success rate unguided frictional placement method low success rate endoscopic method .</detailed_description>
