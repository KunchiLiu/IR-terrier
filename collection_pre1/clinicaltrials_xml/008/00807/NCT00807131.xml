	<detailed_description>Inclusion exclusion criterion : Potential hypertensive subject age 18 year continuously receive medicine pharmacy go identified administrative data source . They must take least hydrochlorothiazide , modification hypertensive drug prescription last 2 month . Patients serious psychiatric disorder severe cognitive impairment , blindness , pregnancy secondary hypertension exclude . To consider eligible , patient mean systolic diastolic blood pressure 140 mmHg 90 mmHg screen visit COM morbidity associate , 130 mmHg 80 mmHg high-risk patient , use validate Omron Hern-705-CP upper arm automate monitor . Strategy/process participants/centres select recruited trial : Research assistants invite potential subject attend pharmacy take medicine via telephone call . By moment , confirm eligibility proceed BP measure . If eligible study , participant receive trial explanation write informed consent obtain . Randomization : The random allocation stratify gender computer-generated sequence , individually centre . To maintain cancel allocation status , opaque , number seal envelope adopt . Interventions : Three different kind pharmacist service adopt , grow complexity level : drug dispensing , counsel patient follow-up 8 month . These method part Brazilian pharmaceutical care agreement , develop year 2002 , compare pharmacy usual care . Seven pharmacists 12 student charge pharmaceutical care program . All train 20 hour-course . Procedures detail write manual operation , willing standardize intervention . Outcomes : The primary outcome BP differences one measure 8-month follow-up baseline BP adherence , determine 2 way : ) measurement plasma level hydrochlorothiazide , measure begin end study ; b ) drug refill along 8-months prior randomization 8-months trial . The occurrence drug-related problem evaluate secondary outcome . Blindness : Open-label study . Sample size : The study design enroll 304 patient equally distribute within 4 center , provide 80 % statistical power reject null hypothesis error 5 % ( two-tailed ) . Sampling size calculate basis standard deviation 10 mmHg , power detect clinically meaningful difference mean change 5 mmHg usual care intervention arm 8-months follow-up , consider 20 % drop-outs . Analyses conduct intention-to-treat basis . • Statistics : To assess difference among intervention group , baseline characteristic compare perform Pearson χ2 test categorical variable F test continuous variable , Fisher Exact test Kruskal-Wallis necessary . For primary outcome , test apply . Analysis covariance use necessary .</detailed_description>
