	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS Although particulate matter ( PM ) exposures link poor respiratory health outcome , study focus populated airsheds urban industrial source PM2.5 . In less-urban area , residential woodstoves major source ambient PM2.5 , result significant woodsmoke exposure indoor environment . This study focus indoor air quality associate health effect among asthmatic child live home whose primary heating source non EPA-certified woodstoves . The primary aim study assess efficacy residential intervention reduce indoor PM exposure woodstoves correspond improvement quality life health outcome asthmatic child . This study allow u characterize woodsmoke effect asthmatic condition evaluate clinically meaningful health outcome among asthmatic . This first randomize control trial US utilize woodsmoke-targeted intervention ass impact consequent reduction indoor PM health outcome susceptible population . The result project translatable region US world biomass burn commonly use heating cooking . This study use three arm ( Tx1 , Tx2 , Tx3 ) randomize placebo-controlled intervention trial . The intervention household level , exposure outcome assess one asthmatic child household . Households Tx1 receive inactive high efficiency particulate air ( HEPA ) device serve placebo group . One intervention test trial replacement old woodstoves clean burn EPA-certified woodstoves ( Tx2 ) . The intervention test installation HEPA filtration device within home ( Tx3 ) . Our preliminary data demonstrate significant reduction indoor PM use intervention . The Primary Aim study assess impact quality life among asthmatic child follow intervention reduce in-home woodsmoke PM exposures . We address follow primary hypothesis : 1a . Asthmatic child home receive new woodstoves Tx2 improve asthma-specific quality life measure compare asthmatic child placebo household , Tx1 . 1. b . Asthmatic child home receive HEPA filtration unit Tx3 improve asthma-specific quality life measure compare asthmatic child placebo household , Tx1 . The Secondary Aims study assess impact intervention residential PM2.5 exposures health outcome . We address follow secondary hypothesis : 2. . Changes winter period PM2.5 exposure home receive intervention ( Tx2 Tx3 ) great change winter period PM2.5 exposure placebo household ( Tx1 ) . Each treatment group evaluate independently placebo group . Secondary residential exposure outcome measure repeatedly pre- post-intervention winter period include : 1 . PM2.5 mass 2. chemical woodsmoke marker PM2.5 filter ( i.e. , levoglucosan abietic acid ) 3. biomarkers woodsmoke exposure urine exhale breath condensate ( i.e. , levoglucosan abietic acid ) 2b . Changes winter period health outcome among asthmatic child live home receive intervention ( Tx2 Tx3 ) improve change winter period health outcome placebo household ( Tx1 ) . Each treatment group evaluate independently placebo group . Secondary exposure outcome include : 1. peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) force expiratory volume first second ( FEV1 ) 2. biomarkers exhale breath condensate ( i.e. , pH nitric oxide ) 3. frequency asthma symptom 4. frequency rescue medication usage 5. healthcare utilization</detailed_description>
