	<brief_summary>COPD rank number 3 WHO list important disease worldwide disease increase mortality . The pathogenesis cigarette smoke-induced COPD obscure , therefore insight need design effective anti-inflammatory agent . We hypothesize healthy individual susceptible smoke demonstrate higher aberrant inflammatory response cigarette smoke . This susceptibility cause heterogeneous factor associate various polymorphic gene interact environment . Objective : - To define mediator involve early induction COPD susceptible smoker ( define new drug target ) - To develop new biological clinical marker early diagnosis monitoring COPD - To compare susceptible non-susceptible individual corticosteroid responsiveness bronchial epithelial cell vitro , study mechanisms smoking-induced corticosteroid unresponsiveness . - To study role candidate gene may play role development fix airway obstruction , identify clue patient 's responsiveness specific drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary study parameters/outcome study : - Local inflammation cigarette smoking assess exhaled breath condensate , microprobe sample bronchial biopsy . - Systemic inflammation cigarette smoking assessed expression establish newly develop marker innate immune cell associate pre-activation . - Extensive clinical characterisation include life style factor , lung function , CT scan lung . - Corticosteroid responsiveness epithelial cell vitro . - Distribution candidate gene ( SNPs ) COPD 5 different group ( see description ) association inflammatory response acute smoking .</detailed_description>
