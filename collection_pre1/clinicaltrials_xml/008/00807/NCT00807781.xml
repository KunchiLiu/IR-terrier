	<brief_title>Mammaglobin-A DNA Vaccine Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I open-label study evaluate safety immunogenicity plasmid mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine . The plasmid mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine formulate naked plasmid DNA vaccine ( WUSM-MGBA-01 ) . The hypothesis study mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine safe human administration capable generate measurable CD8 T cell responses mammaglobin-A . The primary objective study demonstrate safety mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine . The secondary objective evaluate immunogenicity mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine measure ELISPOT analysis , surrogate CD8 T cell function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria A patient eligible inclusion study ALL follow criterion apply : Patient must histologically confirm diagnosis invasive breast cancer . Paraffinembedded tissue tissue section must available immunohistochemistry analysis confirm mammaglobinA expression . Patient must metastatic breast cancer stable least 30 day . This may include patient measurable evaluable disease RECIST criterion , without evidence disease . Patient must chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologic therapy within 30 day initiate therapy study , resolve toxicity experience treatment . Patients receive hormonal therapy supportive therapy bisphosphonates allow . Patients currently trastuzumab allow . Patient must 18 year old . Patient must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 . Patient must life expectancy ≥ 24 week . Patient must adequate organ marrow function define : WBC ≥3,000/μL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/μL platelets ≥100,000/μL total bilirubin ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal AST/ALT ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal Women reproductive potential must negative urine serum βHCG pregnancy test prior enrollment confirm pregnant . Women reproductive potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) 21 day prior study entry duration study participation ( Week 52 ) . Patient must available followup week 52 study . The patient previous history nonbreast malignancy eligible study patient meet follow criterion cancer survivor . A cancer survivor eligible provide follow criterion meet : ( 1 ) patient undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy , ( 2 ) patient consider disease free least 1 year ( exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinomainsitu cervix ) Patient must able willing sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria A patient ineligible inclusion study ANY follow criterion apply : Patient evidence progressive breast cancer within last 30 day . Patient currently receive investigational agent ( ) receive investigational agent within last 30 day . Patient know brain metastasis . Patient known allergy , history serious adverse reaction vaccine anaphylaxis , hive , respiratory difficulty . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patient prior currently active autoimmune disease require management immunosuppression . This include inflammatory bowel disease , ulcerative colitis , crohn 's disease , systemic vasculitis , scleroderma , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis , hemolytic anemia , immunemediated thrombocytopenia , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjögren 's syndrome , sarcoidosis , rheumatologic disease medical condition use medication ( e.g. , corticosteroid ) might make difficult patient complete full course treatment generate immune response vaccine . Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require daily systemic corticosteroid acceptable . Any patient receive steroid discuss PI determine eligible . Patient pregnant . Patients know HIVpositive ineligible potential inability generate immune response vaccine . Patients fail great two chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease . Subjects strong likelihood nonadherence difficulty adhere followup schedule due geographic distance Siteman Cancer Center , knowingly register . Patients know seropositivity hepatitis B antigen hepatitis C antibody . Testing do prior study entry confirm .</criteria>
