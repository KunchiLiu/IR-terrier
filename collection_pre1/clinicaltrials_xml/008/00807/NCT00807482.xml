	<brief_summary>The overall short-term goal project include follow : 1 ) identify gene key function respiratory cilia protect normal lung ; 2 ) effect genetic mutation adversely affect ciliary function cause primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) , result life-shortening lung disease . The long-term goal project develop well understand underlying genetic variability adversely modify ciliary function , predispose common airway disease , asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pathogenesis Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia ( PCD ) Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A key component lung defense efficiency mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) . Primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) human genetic disorder defective MCC . This ongoing project design identify additional disease-causing mutation PCD , correlate molecular etiology ciliary phenotype ( ultrastructure , wave form beat frequency ) . We recently show normal human cilium distinctive waveform , i.e . beat in-plane defined curvature amplitude effective ( forward ) recovery stroke . We hypothesize discrete set gene contribute structure function ciliary outer dynein arm ( ODA ) , inner dynein arm ( IDA ) , central pair ( CP ) radial spoke ( RS ) complex ( CP/RS ) , identify novel genetic mutation different structural component cilium different effect ciliary ultrastructure , wave form , beat frequency . Importantly , able identify patient PCD hallmark diagnostic ultrastructural defect , base distinctive clinical phenotype ( include situs inversus ) , low borderline nasal NO production , abnormal ciliary motility . Identification PCD patient normal ciliary ultrastructure ( ~16 % PCD patient UNC ) offer opportunity discover mutation gene cause functional , ultrastructural , defect ( DNAH11 ) , correlate mutation ciliary waveform abnormality . Over past 4 year , make great progress identify mutation 2 gene ( DNAI1 DNAH5 ) cause ~60 % ODA defect PCD , ~35 % PCD overall . We extend search disease cause mutation PCD , use several different approach , include study additional candidate gene , ( guided ultrastructure ) , plus insight ciliary proteomics , family-based study . Taken together , study provide new insight regard relationship mutation specific gene ciliary ultrastructural functional defect . These study greatly enhance ability diagnose PCD , also lead discovery `` milder '' genetic mutation associate normal ciliary ultrastructure , likely residual ciliary function . Ultimately , allow future study role partial loss ciliary function predisposition common airways disease , chronic bronchitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .</detailed_description>
