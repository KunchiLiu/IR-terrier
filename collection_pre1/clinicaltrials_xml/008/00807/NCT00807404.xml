	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To design construct portable forward image optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) needle probe . - To compare OCT image ex-vivo breast tumor tissue section histology form basis image library in-vivo work . - To initiate development OCT needle probe capable acquire core biopsy sample . OUTLINE : Breast tissue sample obtain mastectomy analyzed ex-vivo optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) histopathological examination . Once routine pathological evaluation tissue sample complete , OCT image perform use portable forward image needle probe insert duct tissue sample . OCT image surface close margin tumor ( present ) well image duct ( ) nipple areola complex ( dilation ) obtain . Images cross section tumor ( sample slice pathologist ) also obtain . The OCT image correlate tissue histology . The image use create correlation histology-OCT atlas evaluation subsequent image future reference .</detailed_description>
