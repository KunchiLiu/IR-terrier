Previously irradiate lesion ( ) allow progress ECOG performance Status 02 Patient untreated chemotherapy EGFR target agent . Adjuvant chemotherapy allow disease relapse least 12 month therapy completion . Patient candidate standard platinumbased chemotherapy Patient compliance trial procedure Patients must willing complete FACTL questionnaire Age â‰¥ 18 year EGFR FISH negative tumor Squamouscell carcinoma , presence neuroendocrine feature small cell carcinoma histology Impossibility ascertain EGFR FISH status Concomitant radiotherapy Less 30 day since completion prior wide field chest radiotherapy persistence radiotherapy relate toxicity . Symptomatic brain metastasis newly diagnose central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases yet definitively treat surgery and/or radiation . Patients previously diagnose treat CNS metastases spinal cord compression may consider evidence clinically stable disease receive steroid therapy .
