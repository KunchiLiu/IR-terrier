	<brief_summary>The stress response induce myocardial cellular damage cardiac surgery may lead myocardial stunning apoptosis , could therefore impair postoperative patient recovery . Surgical trauma typically induce liberation cytokine . Some cytokine strongly associate initiation intracellular proapoptotic pathway activation tyrosine kinases integrins . The latter know deteriorate effect cardiac function strongly involved cardiac remodeling . Dexamethasone typically administer prior cardiac surgery order especially reduce release proinflammatory cytokine . It however never investigate whether additionally reduce proapoptotic signal human heart , thereby eliminate risk factor induction cardiac dysfunction . In present study , investigator therefore aim investigate whether dexamethasone inhibits proapoptotic pathway patient undergo cardiac surgery . Furthermore , investigator would like elucidate whether proposed effect dexamethasone relate reduction stress response heart indirectly suppression cytokine release . For purpose investigator obtain cardiac biopsy plasma patient , randomly assign placebo dexamethasone treatment undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) surgery .</brief_summary>
