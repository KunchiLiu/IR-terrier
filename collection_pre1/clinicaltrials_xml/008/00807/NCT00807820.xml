	<brief_summary>This phase I study evaluate feasibility safety use MRI/MRS identify dominant intraprostatic lesion ( DIL ) selectively boost lesion use inverse plan high dose rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy . The main objective exploit ability MRI/MRS identify cancer region within prostate dominant intraprostatic lesion ( DIL ) . The image data combine treatment plan CT image define treatment plan boost dose deliver DIL 150 % prescribe dose . Dose whole prostate dose deliver adjacent organ change . This accomplish use inverse treatment planning software focus normally occur high dose region within target volume coincide DIL . After enrollment , patient MRI/MRS start treatment . Hormonal therapy external beam radiotherapy give base current standard practice . During HDR brachytherapy , information location tumor within prostate use design brachytherapy treatment plan . We try increase dose DIL coincide exist high dose region DIL use inverse planning software . Dose prostate , adjacent structure remain current treatment practice . Timing delivery brachytherapy change current practice . After treatment , patient remain study follow 12 month treatment toxicity evaluate . A two-stage study design apply stopping rule safety . Once patient come study routinely followed disease outcome late toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.1 The goal radiotherapy deliver high dose radiation target volume minimize dose surround normal tissue . Using CT base three-dimensional treatment planning system multiple field technique , three dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( CRT ) become standard care external beam radiotherapy prostate cancer . Multiple institutional study prospective randomize trial do document safety efficacy modality . Brachytherapy alternative method deliver conformal radiotherapy treatment prostate cancer . The technique HDR prostate brachytherapy clinical practice since 1980 's [ 1-13 ] . Kovacs et al report one early experience use HDR brachytherapy boost University Kiel . [ 10 , 11 , 13 ] Patients treat mostly T2b-T3 , G3 . They use combination split course external beam radiotherapy two 15 Gy HDR treatment . They report 18 % positive biopsy rate 18 month post treatment . The result update 10 year 78 percent 171 patient remain free disease median follow-up 55 month . Mate et al Swedish Medical Center report experience HDR brachytherapy [ 9 ] . They use moderate hypofractionated schema four treatment 3-4 Gy fraction HDR treatment combine 45-50 Gy external beam radiotherapy . They recommend routine cystoscopy end implant procedure ensure catheter place proper depth avoid injure urethra . Pretreatment patient characteristic stage T1b T3c , mean initial PSA 12.9 Gleason grade range 3 9 . They report 84 % 5-year biochemical disease free survival . Martinez et al William Beaumont Hospital report on-going prospective dose escalation trial use HDR brachytherapy boost . There multiple update result . [ 5-7 , 12 ] They continue dose escalate use increasingly large fraction HDR treatment range 5.5-6.5 Gy x 3 8.25-11.5 Gy x 2 combine 46 Gy external beam radiotherapy . As recent update , show acceptable toxicity level use 9.5 Gy x 2 treatment . Patients PSA ≥ 10 , T ≥ T2b , Gleason score ≥ 7 select trial . Despite high frequency poor prognostic factor , actuarial biochemical control rate 89 % 2 year 63 % 5 year . The 5-year actuarial rate local failure distant metastasis 16 % 14 % , respectively . Borghede et al . Goteborg University Sweden report experience use 50 Gy external beam radiotherapy combine 2 fraction 10 Gy HDR boost . [ 1 , 2 ] They use ultrasound target tumor nodule within prostate give additional 5 Gy boost HDR treatment . Patients include study T1-3 , grade 1-3 . They report 4 % positive biopsy rate 18-months post treatment . This remarkably low positive biopsy rate consider hormonal therapy use study . The result clinical trial others show technique HDR brachytherapy prostate cancer feasible minimal morbidity . Other institutional trial suggest HDR boost may efficacious compare external beam radiotherapy alone external beam radiotherapy short term hormonal therapy . Results study need confirm large multi-institutional trial .</detailed_description>
