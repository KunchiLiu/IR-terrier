	<brief_summary>Radiofrequency ablation effective treatment atrial fibrillation . However , 20 % time atrial fibrillation recurs . Steroids give ablation may decrease inflammation cause ablation thus improve heal decrease chance recurrence atrial fibrillation . In study patient randomize receive intravenous steroid immediately follow ablation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation , common arrhythmia , source considerable morbidity . Prevalence atrial fibrillation adult 0.5 % , increase 10 % patient age seventy five . Numbers expect increase nearly 2.5 fold next 50 year . Radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation cure atrial fibrillation become established effective therapy many atrial fibrillation patient . However , approximately 20 % return recurrent atrial fibrillation ablation . RF ablation directly target substrate atrial fibrillation , cauterize cardiac tissue application radiofrequency energy , cause myocardial lesion effectively block errant pathway . This process RF ablation induces inflammatory effect . As lesion heals often enlarge . This may contribute recurrence atrial fibrillation ablation , well increase pain . There early evidence single dose corticosteroid ablation may improve heal process , thus decrease pain incidence recurrent atrial fibrillation . The aim study determine usefulness one time dose solumedrol follow radiofrequency ablation atrial fibrillation..</detailed_description>
