	<brief_summary>The presence pool cell latently infect HIV-1 patient take HAART viral load 50 copies/mL main limitation eradication virus body . This viral reservoir prevents antiretroviral therapy interrupt ; therefore , patient oblige continue treatment period calculate great 60 year . Despite important advance knowledge biology reservoir , still real knowledge dynamic . The opportunity carry clinical trial first time integrase inhibitor exceptional , since result could provide important information nature reservoir . If maintenance reservoir dynamic process , inclusion integrase inhibitor expect lead reduction size reservoir . This effect could critical include IAT ( viral reactivation ) , since , theory , would necessary act small reservoir . Current consensus would necessary act almost 100 % viral reservoir ( approximately 1,000,000 cell ) . The study also design enable u understand biochemical molecular mechanism certain drug induce viral reactivation vitro previous step clinical trial aim reactivate viral latency eradicate HIV-1 body .</brief_summary>
