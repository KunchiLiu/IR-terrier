	<brief_summary>The diagnosis clinically-significant meniscal tear knee remain challenging , unknown injury become painful . The limitation diagnostic magnetic resonance image result arthroscopy always beneficial . Elucidation biochemical pathway underlie pain condition may aid patient selection surgery provide pharmacotherapeutic target . Cytokines may involve pain follow meniscus injury diagnostic cytokine assay may help physicians differentiate patient may benefit arthroscopy may .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lavage operative contralateral knee comparison perform anesthesia prior arthroscopy infusion sterile saline knee joint follow immediate withdrawal syringe . Sixteen asymptomatic control subject also contribute knee sample . The concentration 17 inflammatory cytokines/chemokines measure use multiplexed immunoassay panel . Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging finding cytokine assay result compare `` gold-standard '' intraoperative finding .</detailed_description>
