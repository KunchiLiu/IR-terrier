	<brief_summary>Aim 1 : To evaluate effect antipsychotic treatment group Activity Energy Expenditure . The project hypothesize subject treat olanzapine demonstrate great decrease AEE time subject treat ziprasidone , due least part sedate effect olanzapine . Aim 2 : To evaluate effect antipsychotic treatment group Energy Intake . The project hypothesize subject treat olanzapine demonstrate great increase EI time subject treat ziprasidone , base high histamine type 1 ( H1 ) receptor affinity olanzapine relationship H1 affinity hunger and/or satiety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall purpose research determine two commonly prescribe antipsychotic medication , olanzapine ( Zyprexa ) ziprasidone ( Geodon ) , affect weight gain increase appetite and/or increase sedation result decrease activity . Undesirable change body weight , blood sugar control , type 2 diabetes , blood lipid occur commonly people schizophrenia people without psychiatric condition . Although difference glucose regulation first report schizophrenia use antipsychotic medication , antipsychotic treatment may contribute problem , though happens understood . This study propose use doubly-labeled water ( DLW ) method measure degree weight gain ( fat mass ) due increase appetite , decrease physical activity tire sleepy , combination . Doubly-labeled water contains stable isotope ( non-radioactive form ) hydrogen oxygen make water , isotopes slowly pass urine participant drink DLW . The number hydrogen oxygen isotope find urine sample tell u many calorie participant 's body use . The DLW method use people obesity type medical problem . It 's recognize accurate measure number calorie burn throughout typical day , many calorie take food drink . By measure factor people take antipsychotic medication , doctor gain good understanding effect antipsychotic medication body weight fat mass . This could lead development good way prevent treat weight gain diabetes patient take antipsychotic medication .</detailed_description>
