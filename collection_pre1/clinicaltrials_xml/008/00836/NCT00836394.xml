	<brief_summary>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) one common chronic illness child , recent data suggest 1 4 1000 Canadian child youth cope condition . Many JIA child enter adulthood permanent joint damage5 . In parallel , significant number affect deficit muscle function . In addition impact physical function , muscle play important role maintain joint health . The overall aim proposal evaluate novel therapeutic intervention - whole body vibration ( WBV ) - ability improve muscle function biomechanics low extremity joint JIA order prevent joint degeneration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Whole Body Vibration Therapy Children With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project aim evaluate effect therapy call whole body vibration ( WBV ) muscle function joint biomechanics child adolescent suffer juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) . JIA common chronic form arthritis child affect least 1 1000 Canadian child youth . Current data suggest large number child suffer JIA encounter permanent joint damage , direct effect inflammation important contributor . Nevertheless , recent research also show impaired muscle function subsequent alteration joint loading might induce joint damage . Fifty percent JIA patient significant impairment muscle function often present patient active arthritis anymore . In addition optimum medical treatment disease , therefore important improve muscle function order protect joint . WBV therapy might interest technique achieve JIA patient . It able improve muscle function efficiently relatively short train time time confers load low limb 30 % body weight . The WBV device consist plate go along fulcrum high frequency . The patient stand WBV device vibration induce muscle stretch reflex produce muscle contraction . These muscle contraction similar muscle activity exercise perceive painful unpleasant . The technique use child several condition impair muscle function . The primary question investigate propose study whether WBV therapy significantly improve muscle function JIA patient . In addition , effect improvement muscle function gait load individual joint low extremity examine . Finally effect WBV therapy quality life assess . We propose conduct control trial investigation . This imply , one group study participant , call intervention group , WBV therapy , whereas second group , call control group , follow daily habitual activity . All participant initial assessment muscle function , electrical muscle activity joint biomechanics completely painless measurement technique Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario ( CHEO ) nearby Human Motion Biomechanics lab University Ottawa . In addition , MRI low leg without contrast medium do confirm absence joint effusion well bone muscle edema . Quality life assess standard questionnaire validate JIA . Subsequently , study participant intervention group well parent introduce therapy two separate session CHEO . They take WBV device home perform 6 minute train 5 day week 3 month . Each month , return CHEO assessment muscle function demonstration training technique . At end 3 month period , intervention control group patient repeat initial set assessment include MRI . After another 3 month period , participant return final assessment muscle function joint biomechanics MRI document persistence change observe .</detailed_description>
