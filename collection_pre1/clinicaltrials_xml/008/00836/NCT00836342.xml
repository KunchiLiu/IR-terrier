	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine difference skin carotenoid level subject previous squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) , subject previous basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Between Skin Carotenoid Levels Previous History Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There experimental clinical research evaluate association different carotenoid incidence malignancy , include Non- Melanoma Skin Cancer ( NMSC ) . An easy inexpensive way determine subject would benefit supplementation carotenoid retinoids could measurement skin carotenoid levels.The least invasive way perform Raman spectroscopy technique use laser light use quantify carotenoid skin . We compare skin carotenoid level subject previous history SCC BCC subject without history previous NMSC .</detailed_description>
