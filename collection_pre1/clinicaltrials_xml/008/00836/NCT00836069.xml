	<brief_summary>This study randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , multi-site , Phase 3 , placebo control fixed-dose study PD 0332334 paroxetine 528 outpatient generalize anxiety disorder . Subjects randomize follow treatment ( 132 subject per treatment group ) : PD 0332334 225 mg BID ( 450 mg/day ) , PD 0332334 300 mg BID ( 600 mg/day ) , placebo paroxetine 20 mg QD ( 20 mg/day ) . [ QD : daily , qAM : morning , BID : twice daily ] . The study consist 3 phase : initial screen phase must complete 7 14 day prior randomization ; 8-week double-blind treatment phase ; 2-week double-blind dose-tapering follow-up phase . After obtain write informed consent investigator initiate washout prior psychotropic medication . After washout prior psychotropic medication complete investigator must ensure subject long take psychotropic medication least 14 day prior randomization visit . In addition investigator must ensure screen visit procedure ( exception obtain informed consent ) complete within 14 day randomization visit . Potential subject approach regularly schedule clinic visit , upon referral another physician , response research advertisement . Those call participate short phone pre-screen . This allow u determine person fit limit inclusion/exclusion criterion request dedicate long period time in-person screen . Additionally give interested individual opportunity learn study review consent form family , friend , physician prior come screen make final decision regard study enrollment . Once subject give informed consent , screen process study commence . Subjects fulfill entry criterion randomize receive ONE follow 4 treatment double-blind fashion : PD 0332334 225 mg BID , PD 0332334 300 mg BID , placebo , paroxetine 20 mg QAM . PD 0332334 titrate PD 0332334 225 mg BID PD 0332334 300 mg BID treatment group . The titration PD 0332334 125 mg beginning study . In addition PD 0332334 225 mg BID PD 0332334 300 mg BID treatment group titrate end study . The 20 mg daily dose paroxetine use study base approve label use paroxetine patient GAD . Doses select Phase 3 study base safety efficacy information know PD 0332334 pregabalin ( PGB ) , α2δ ligand approve treatment GAD Europe The subject enrol men woman age 18 65 meet DSM-IV criterion generalize anxiety disorder preponderance anxious symptom depressive symptom . De-identified blood sample collect study subject Screening ( Visit 1 ) accord standard Molecular Profiling supplement protocol . Participation component optional study subject .

( Note : The Suicidality module MINI diagnostic interview CSSRS use aid assessment suicidality , replace overall clinical judgment determination suicidal risk ) . 6 . Current use psychotropic medication ( ie , drug normally prescribe depression , mania , anxiety , insomnia , psychosis ) discontinue 2 week prior randomization . Fluoxetine prohibit within 5 week randomization . In event inadvertent administration psychotropic medication 2 week prior randomization , continue eligibility assess case case basis investigator medical monitor . 7 .
