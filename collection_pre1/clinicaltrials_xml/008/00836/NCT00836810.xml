	<brief_summary>Polymyalgia Rheumatica ( PMR ) disease usually affect old people . Patients complain stiffness pain around shoulder hip . The stiffness severe morning . The joint affect disease . Research Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) , also much bad morning , show IL−6 ( chemical messenger ) peak morning low level even . This may explain stiffness severe morning . The investigator recently show timed release tablet ( TRT ) prednisone reduce morning IL−6 level close normal RA patient . In PMR , IL−6 level high . Given RA PMR variation symptom ( bad morning ) ; 's likely PMR patient variation IL−6 level . In pilot study 4 patient conduct within department , IL−6 level , indeed , show pattern similar find RA patient , number patient small result need confirm . PMR treat moderate dos glucocorticoid 2 year . While generally abolish symptom , dos likely cause adverse effect high blood pressure , weight gain diabetes . These side effect much less frequent low dos use sufficient control PMR use traditional dosing regime . Therefore , investigator wish investigate whether TRT prednisone PMR reduce IL−6 morning symptom similar RA . The investigator think , achieve symptomatic relief lower dose . If case , treat patient low dos may mean reduce risk glucocorticoid induce side effect future . Patients recruit outpatient clinic University Hospitals Bristol , NHS Foundation Trust , Rheumatology Centre . Each patient give fully inform consent give detail study patient information sheet . The research doctor take consent 2−5 day information provide presence witness . The study consist collection analysis sequential blood sample 24 hour period 2 occasion 2 week apart , take TRT prednisone 7 mg / standard release prednisolone 7 mg intervening period . The investigator aim recruit 12 patient arm . A single blood sample take patient come routine review 2 week later .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The volunteer stay overnight Rheumatology Centre ; 24-hour Research Facility two occasion ( Night A Night B ) 12-16 day apart . This slight flexibility allow leeway arrange residency night . In general investigator aim 14 day . After Night A , volunteer randomize ( pre-prepared seal envelope ) take one tablet morning evening . Half patient take active standard release prednisolone morning . The half receive active TRT Prednisone 7mg take even 22:00 day Night B . All study medication discontinue standard therapy ( prednisolone 15mg morning ) commence . Patients review 2 week ensure expect clinical response measure IL-6 cytokine blood sample also need check acute phase response . On Night A Night B , volunteer attend Rheumatology Centre 15:00 . First , standard assessment tool use research doctor assess state patient 's condition . These assessment : - Morning stiffness ( minute ) - Pain ( visual analogue scale ) - Patient 's opinion condition - Clinician 's opinion condition - Health Assessment Questionnaire - BRAF-MDQ fatigue scale Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale . An intravenous ( IV ) cannula insert elbow area . At least one hour IV cannula place , usually 16:30 , blood sample ( 2ml ) take IV cannula cannula flush . At 22:30 main light switch volunteer encourage sleep . In total , 20 sample take cannula 24 hour . The investigator calculate mean standard deviation ( non-parametric analysis data normally distribute ) blood cytokine time point . These mean standard deviation compare pre- post-TRT prednisone sample .</detailed_description>
