	<brief_summary>Research Hypothesis : Ipilimumab ( antibody block negative signal T cell ) administer alone combination pancreatic cancer vaccine ( allogeneic pancreatic tumor cell transfected GM-CSF gene ) , acceptable safety profile subject locally advanced , unresectable metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Primary Objective : To determine safety profile ipilimumab alone combination pancreatic cancer vaccine subject locally advanced , unresectable metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Secondary Objectives : - To estimate overall survival ( OS ) serve primary efficacy signal . - To explore association T cell responses immunological response OS patient receive treatment . - To estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) , immune relate best overall response rate ( irBOR ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , duration response patient receive treatment . - To explore association immune-related adverse event ( IRAEs ) ORR . - To measure tumor marker kinetics ( CA 19-9 ) patient receive treatment .</brief_summary>
