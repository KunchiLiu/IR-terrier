	<brief_summary>For many year , antimuscarinics first-line pharmacological treatment OAB . A recent meta-analysis randomise , control trial antimuscarinic treatment OAB conclude drug provide significant improvement OAB symptom compare placebo benefit limited clinical significance . The analysis question clinical significance trial result , one reason lack data use sensitive patient-driven criterion . Traditional symptomatic urodynamic measure treatment success may meaningful clinician often little meaning patient . Therefore , patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) , provide subjective measure patient 's response treatment , useful . Recently , clinician treat OAB begin recognize value PROs still overlook treatment efficacy term patient-reported goal achievement ( PGA ) . Patients OAB combination symptom extent individual OAB symptom affect patient varies . Also patient different goal treatment . Therefore , assess degree goal achievement patient provide new aspect treatment benefit . This control study advance understand OAB term patient-centered treatment goal goal achievement provide new aspect treatment benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives 1 . Primary objective : To explore `` Patient-reported Goal Attainment ( PGA ) '' 12 week treatment tolterodine extended-release ( ER ) 4mg female overactive bladder ( OAB ) patient . 2 . Secondary objective : To explore patient-reported treatment goal efficacy tolterodine patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) , micturition diary parameter , safety parameter baseline 12 week treatment female OAB patient . 2 . Specific aim : To compare efficacy tolterodine ER 4mg placebo , PROs term PGA 12 week treatment female OAB patient . 3 . Experimental/research design 1 . 12-week randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group , prospective study Korean woman symptoms OAB 2 .
