	<brief_summary>Intravenous ( IV ) morphine requirement immediate postoperative pain control depend upon complex interplay patient history , wound severity , environment , genetics . Even relatively uniform stimulus intensity , associate tonsillectomy adenoidectomy ( T &amp; A ) , mark individual variability response morphine . Some patient refractory standard dos need increased amount . Others sensitive , require less drug attain acceptable pain level , and/or experience unwanted side effect limit dose . A significant number must switch different analgesic altogether . Despite long clinical history morphine postoperative analgesic , researcher begin examine origin response variability . The investigator look 2000 retrospective Tonsillectomy Adenoidectomy case use data incorporate additional patient , surgical , environmental factor may contribute response variability , investigator propose prospective genome-wide association ( GWA ) study 1500 child age 4 18 treated IV morphine sulfate day surgery T &amp; A .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Morphine Tonsilectomy Adenoidectomy ( T &amp; A ) Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) study do part large institutional Center Applied Genomics ( CAG ) project entitle `` A Study Genetic Causes Complex Pediatric Disorders '' ( GCPD study ) , approve Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) IRB , 2006-7-4886 . By combine Genome Wide Association ( GWA ) PK data , wish conduct Pharmacogenomic ( PG ) study IV morphine administer standard care pediatric day surgery T &amp; A . Because expect several gene play role morphine response , must use large , relatively uniform pediatric surgical population T &amp; A . Through observation minimal-risk blood sample cohort child , hope identify genetic variant predict analgesic response ( serum level ) morphine sulfate . Pediatric patient age 4-18 , present significant tonsillar/adenoidal tissue hypertrophy , sleep disorder breathe and/or recurrent infection , require T &amp; A eligible . Morphine common IV analgesic use T &amp; A CHOP . As necessary accurately define analgesic response phenotype , morphine administer structured manner consistent standard care institution . As defined , child resistant morphine ( MR ) sensitive ( MS ) identify specific phenotype compare normal responder ( NR ) GWA study . This study begin retrospective electronic database query 2000 day surgery T &amp; A case 11/1/2005 10/31/2008 morphine use sole IV analgesic . Data portion study help u refine phenotype parameter , robust subpopulation response type emerge , provide background information require eventual project fund National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . The prospective portion study follow additional 1650 child newly enrol CAG study present T &amp; A .</detailed_description>

The reliability morphine analgesic requirement phenotype could adversely affected subtle communication difference subject nursing staff assess pain administer morphine patient recovery language barrier exist . Parents must also fluent English bedside shortly child 's arrival recovery could influence child understands pain score interact nurse research staff . 3 . Those parents/guardian subject consent , willing participate GCPD study ( IRB 200674886 ) 4 . Patients &lt; 4 age exclude improve phenotype reliability . Due high empirical risk postoperative obstruction follow T &amp; A , child &lt; 4 age admit overnight observation . The titration morphine difficult patient clinician generally follow restrictive dosing regimen total morphine dose drawn extend period . Furthermore , selfreport Faces Pain Scale Revised ( FPSR ) validate child ≥ 4 use corroborate morphine response phenotypes primarily base morphine dos administer achieve low Face , Legs , Activity , Cry , Consolability ( FLACC ) score . The latter behavioral scoring require early morphine administration child adolescent emerge anesthesia may difficulty express first 30 min . In addition , important statistical analysis sequential score system time applicable age . Finally , incidence emergence agitation/delirium , clinical phenomenon share feature pain , become distinct 1530 min , high young patient . ( Sikich , 2004 ; Vlajkovic , 2007 ) By exclude child &lt; 4 decrease proportion subject whose FLACC score may high basis emergence agitation/delirium . 5 . Significant comorbid condition require nonstandard anesthetic regimen history severe postoperative nausea vomit require propofol infusion , total intravenous anesthestic ( TIVA ) technique and/or mandate plan postoperative hospital admission 6 . Documented allergy adverse reaction morphine patient 7 . Use opioids ( e.g . codeine , oxycodone , morphine , hydromorphone ) within previous month 8 . Use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent acetaminophen 3 day precede T &amp; A . No acetaminophen include premedication regimen day surgery .</criteria>
