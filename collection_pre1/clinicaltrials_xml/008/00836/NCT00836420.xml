	<detailed_description>Fulminant hepatic failure ( FHF ) often complicate cerebral edema , high intracranial pressure ( ICP ) brain death . Accordingly intracranial pressure often monitor patient order able institute treatment high ICP evolves . As routinely do patient severe head injury microdialysis monitoring catheter also place procedure measure metabolic change responsible surge high ICP . The aim descriptive protocol determine rise glutamate , lactate pyruvate concentration brain cortex involve development surge high ICP patient FHF . The study observatory nature also record influence intervention course critical illness .</detailed_description>
