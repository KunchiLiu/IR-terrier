	<brief_title>Modified Atkins Diet Childhood Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several severe catastrophic epilepsy present childhood , include severe infantile myoclonic epilepsy , Lennox Gastaut syndrome myoclonic-astatic epilepsy ( Doose syndrome ) . Seizures disorder difficult control ; sometimes expense multiple toxic level antiepileptic medications.Epilepsy surgery feasible small number , also cost prohibitively high . Uncontrolled seizure pose variety risk child , include high rate mortality , developmental delay and/or regression , cognitive impairment . Thus effective treatment control seizures fundamental improve overall outcome childhood epilepsy . The shortcoming antiepileptic drug therapy epilepsy surgery make need alternative treatment . The ketogenic diet one old available treatment epilepsy . It medically supervise high fat , low carbohydrate , restrict protein diet maintain chronic state ketosis provide protein calorie adequate growth . The ketogenic diet compare favourably new antiepileptic drug ( AED 's ) develop treatment epilepsy child Studies newer antiepileptic drug vigabatrin , lamotrigine , tiagabine gabapentin indicate 3 % 10 % intractable patient achieve complete relief seizure introduction new drug . Whereas ketogenic diet , 33 % patient intractable epilepsy 50 % reduction seizures 15-20 % become seizure free.Also , many child maintain diet able antiepileptic drug decrease withdrawn . This lead improvement alertness , behaviour cognition . The traditional ketogenic diet , 4:1 ratio fat : carbohydrate + protein drawback . It restrict calorie fluid , require weigh food . Protein generally restrict 1 g/kg/day , majority remain calorie form fat . This may lead hypoproteinemia growth problem . Hospitalization generally advocate diet initiation , fast non-fasting initiation . Side effect diet include kidney stone , constipation , acidosis , diminish growth , weight loss , hyperlipidemia . The modified Atkins diet nonpharmacologic therapy intractable childhood epilepsy design less restrictive alternative traditional ketogenic diet . This diet start outpatient basis without fast , allow unlimited protein fat , restrict calorie fluid . Early study demonstrate efficacy safety.13-20 However study uncontrolled , enrol small number patient . There randomize control trial evaluate efficacy modify Atkins diet child adult refractory epilepsy . Hence study plan investigate whether clear benefit term seizure control child refractory epilepsy treat modify Atkins diet , versus control . Eligible child randomize use computer generate random number table two group : intervention control arm . Both group undergo baseline 4-week observation period , parent ask maintain daily seizure activity log ; record seizure type , duration frequency . In intervention arm , child start modify Atkins diet 4-week baseline period . The control group receive normal diet dietetic input , remain on-going antiepileptic medication 3 month . Anti-epileptic medication remain unchanged 3 month trial period group , unless change AED regimen medically indicate ; e.g . drug side effect status epilepticus ; case standard therapy provide . Children review outpatient 1 , 2 3 month . Urinary ketone check hospital visit . A 3-day dietary intake chart review visit compute calorie carbohydrate intake , reinforce compliance . Weight check visit . Seizure frequency record daily 4-week baseline period 3 month study period . At end 3 month study period , number seizure precede 28 day use calculate mean seizure number , express percentage mean baseline number daily seizure ( ie , number seizure 4 week child start either diet control phase study ) .No change make child 's antiepileptic medication 4-week baseline 3-month study period , unless medically indicate ; e.g . drug side effect , status epilepticus ; case standard therapy provide . Tolerability diet side effect evaluate mean parental interview visit : vomiting , lethargy , poor appetite , refusal feed constipation . Any parental concern parental report side effect also note .</detailed_description>
