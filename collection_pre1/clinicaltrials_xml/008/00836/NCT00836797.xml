	<brief_summary>After extraction tooth , bony socket heals naturally due absent tooth presence support socket , bone resorption occur vertically bucco lingually bucco palataly . This bony resorption ultimately effect lot thing like - support adjacent teeth become weak , shallow ridge make difficult future prosthesis retention , less bony support implant placement future popular effective way tooth replacement day . So day keep integrity contour alveolar bony socket important patient future rehabilitation . The use scaffold help maintain integrity alveolar bony socket thus provide vital support adjacent teeth , preserve alveolar crest height , maintain bony contour , help prevent bleeding , importantly help bone regeneration vital factor future rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiographic Assessment Bone Regeneration Alveolar Sockets With PLGA Scaffold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A case control study design adopt . Patients extraction tooth include surgical extraction due periodontal reason select . Consent patient take procedure effect possibility explain patient . Extraction do scaffold material place inside socket . Sockets scaffold variable studied socket without scaffold place inside socket control group . An OPG x ray take head position standardize positioning device . A second x-ray take follow technique two month ( assessment bone healing practice normally ) final x-ray take 3 month first x-ray ( normally do clinic assessment socket prior implantation . The OPG x ray take patient bite bite plate device fabricate embedded wire inside radiopague . If distance wire line ( occlusal plane ) alveolar bony height ' ' actual diameter metallic ball ' b ' radiographic ball diameter ' c ' equation ( a√ób ) /c give u distance alveolar bony crest wire line . The measurement take determine distance alveolar crest wire line remain increased . If remains , suggest scaffold material maintain socket prevent alveolar bone resorption , distance increase indicate vertical loss alveolar bone extent measure compare socket without support immediate post-extraction scaffold . This study determine firstly whether scaffold allows bone regeneration human alveolar socket normal time secondly whether would help preserve alveolar bone height compare case without scaffold . Consent select patient take procedure . Extraction do scaffold material place inside socket . Socket scaffold case socket without scaffold control group multiple extraction case . Radiographic assessment do ass bone regeneration prescribe pre-extraction stage , 2 month bone heal stage 3 month ( initial extraction ) implant planning stage usual clinical practice . Assessment bony height make prescribed formula radiograph take comparison make control case . The following criterion select patient .</detailed_description>
