	<brief_summary>To assess magnitude frequency change chemo/cytokine expression woman receive radiation treatment . To ass impact race/ethnicity magnitude frequency change chemo/cytokine expression radiation therapy breast cancer . And finally assess interaction radiation-induced chemo/cytokine expression change , race/ethnicity , respect normal tissue reaction radiation tumor-associated outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well recognize diagnostic therapeutic gain make management breast cancer last 2 decade fully realize group . African American woman breast cancer great risk recurrence , short overall survival , short survival relapse , bad toxicity worse cosmetic outcome Caucasian counterpart . ( 1-5 ) These difference outcome persist even control age , stage presentation . ( 1 , 6 , 7 ) Being similarly treat modern breast conserving therapy ( lumpectomy adjuvant whole breast irradiation ) recognize center excellence little alleviate disparity outcome . ( 5 , 8 ) Controlling socioeconomic factor decrease severity disparity , completely explain . ( 4 ) Theories abound cause outcome inequality . Many theory take either psychosocial , biologic bent . One potential biologic cause may chemokine cytokine expression . Chemokines cytokine ( chemo/cytokines ) proteins peptide use cell signal . Primarily secrete T cell macrophage , influence cellular activation , differentiation , function act mediator inflammatory immune response . ( 9 ) There substantial research link chemo/cytokines ( TNFα , PDGF , TGFβ , Il-6 , IL-8 ) tumor promotion progression . For example , TNFα link great cell survival despite genomic injury turn lead great genetic alteration malignant transformation . TNFα associate breast cancer progression metastasis . ( 10 ) Blocking receptor PDGF appear decrease metastatic potential breast cancer cell line . ( 11 , 12 ) TGFβ inhibit T cell B cell lymphocytes natural killer cell cytotoxicity . ( 13 ) This immuno-suppression show promote tumor progression mammary cancer cell line . ( 13 , 14 ) The ability TGFβ promote tumor progression well recognize become therapeutic target researcher . ( 15 , 16 ) IFNγ show inhibit mammary cancer cell proliferation angiogenesis vitro vivo . ( 17 ) Clinically , Lyon et al report significantly high circulating level TNFα , Il-6 , IL-8 woman breast cancer compare woman negative breast biopsy . ( 18 ) Additionally , researcher directly correlate increased level IL-6 development progression breast cancer , decrease overall survival ( OAS ) . ( 19 ) Conclusion : Expression certain chemokines cytokine associate development progression breast cancer .</detailed_description>
