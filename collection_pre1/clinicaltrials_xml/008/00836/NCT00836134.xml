	<detailed_description>Healthy child , age 1 17 year age , undergo elective umbilical hernia repair consider study . After informed consent/assent obtain , subject randomize one two group . Group A receive local infiltration 0.25 % bupivacaine surgeon end subject 's surgery . Group B undergo ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block use 0.25 % bupivacaine prior incision anesthesiologist skilled performance block . All subject receive standardize anesthetic surgery . Subjects assign Group A ( local infiltration ) receive 2mcg/kg fentanyl prior incision intra-operative pain management . Subjects assign Group B Rectus Sheath Block fentanyl give time . Fentanyl short-acting opioid analgesic . It 's duration action dose use approximately one hour close expect length surgery . Therefore , expect influence pain management surgery . Pain score assess member research team . They blind technique subject randomize . This person involve direct care subject . These observation make use age-appropriate scoring system ( FLACC FACES scale ) . Scoring do every 5 minute subject recovery room every 30 minute Phase II . This do subject discharge hospital .
