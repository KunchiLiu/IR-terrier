	<brief_summary>This protocol aim establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) submyeloablative dos Busulfex ® hope tolerable , submyeloablative dose establish test efficacy alternative therapy refractory pediatric brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Busulfan Refractory Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric brain tumor remain among common malignancy childhood , second leukemia , represent 20 % childhood cancer United States ( 1 ) . Although significant stride make therapy pediatric malignancy , mortality patient brain tumor remain high . The mainstay therapy CNS tumor combination surgery , chemotherapy , radiation . High dose chemotherapy stem cell transplant propose alternative radiation , young child relapse patient . Stem cell transplantation however without significant side effect well transplant relate mortality . Busulfan alkylating agent able exert cytotoxic effect hydrolysis subsequent production carbonium ion , directly alkylating DNA , interfere replication , ultimately lead cell death ( 2 ) . Busulfan readily cross blood barrier , allow CNS level nearly equal plasma level ( 5,6 ) . Primary Objectives : To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Busulfex ® child recurrent , progressive , refractory primary brain tumor . Secondary Objectives : To obtain preliminary data regard progression free survival ( PFS ) event free survival ( EFS ) Busulfex ® use submyeloablative dos child recurrent , progressive , refractory primary brain tumor . To describe plasma pharmacokinetics Busulfex ® child recurrent , progressive , refractory primary brain tumor , use continuous infusion .</detailed_description>
