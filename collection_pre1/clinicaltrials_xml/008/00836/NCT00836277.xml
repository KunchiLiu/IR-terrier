	<brief_summary>This study propose single-arm , phase II study irinotecan panitumumab second-line therapy patient advance esophageal adenocarcinoma . Efficacy assess response rate , exploratory outcome endpoint time progression ( panitumumab may result prolonged stable disease ) . In addition usual safety assessment , molecular correlate carry order search pharmacodynamic pharmacogenomic feature may correlate response . Measures host/patient immune function assess evaluate relationship Fc receptor polymorphism response patient treat panitumumab . Measures EGFR protein phosphoprotein expression immunohistochemical- ( IHC- ) staining , K-ras mutation status1 reverse-phase protein array ( RPPA ) EGFR gene amplification fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) assess exploratory correlate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Irinotecan Panitumumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer highly lethal malignancy increase incidence , especially histologic subtype adenocarcinoma . Fully 50 % patient present advanced , incurable disease . Of remainder diagnose curable stage , 30 % long-term survivor . Advances therapy local advanced disease stagnant past decade . As , urgent need advance therapy . The development modern cytotoxic chemotherapy particular , biologically targeted agent , provide hope improve outcome patient . The semi-synthetic derivative camptothecin , irinotecan , active esophageal adenocarcinoma , alone combination cisplatin . Use front-line therapy multi-modality regimen combination chemotherapy common . More recently , elucidation role epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) pathway esophageal cancer result pre-clinical clinical study activity EGFR direct agent treatment esophageal cancer . The anti-EGFR antibody , panitumumab cetuximab , active single agent combination cytotoxic chemotherapy patient colorectal adenocarcinoma . In particular , combination irinotecan cetuximab active irinotecan refractory colorectal cancer , panitumumab active compare best supportive care . In clinic , empiric evidence unexpectedly significant activity combination cetuximab irinotecan third-line treatment advance esophageal adenocarcinoma . Panitumumab clinical advantage , compare cetuximab , fully human , , thus result low frequency infusion reaction . This recent experience target agent solid tumor , still promise , yield relatively modest results.7-11 Notably , however , retrospective analysis clinical trial consistently reveal difference treatment effect subgroup patient associate specific molecular profiles.12-18 These finding suggest potential rational approach trial design would use patient tumor characteristic select patient therapy , thus enrich population responder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis locally recurrent metastatic adenocarcinoma esophagus incurable standard therapy . Patients must measurable disease outside previous radiation port , develop port since conclusion radiation biopsyproven recurrent cancer . One prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease , exception prior irinotecan panitumumab . Prior radiation therapy 20 % bone marrow allow . No treatment wide field radiation within 4 week entry onto study . Full recovery effect prior surgery . Man woman &gt; 18 year age .

History know presence central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases unless CNS metastasis irradiate stable . History another primary cancer , except : Curatively treat situ cervical cancer Curatively resect nonmelanoma skin cancer Other primary solid tumor curatively treat know active disease present treatment administer great equal 5 year prior enrollment Preexisting peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition panitumumab irinotecan . Patients receive medication substance establish probable inhibitor inducer P450 3A4 ineligible . Prior antiEGFr antibody therapy ( eg , cetuximab ) treatment small molecule EGFr inhibitor ( eg , gefitinib , erlotinib , lapatinib ) Radiotherapy &lt; = 14 day prior enrollment . Systemic chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy , experimental approve proteins/antibodies ( small molecule Phase I study ) ( eg , bevacizumab ) &lt; = 30 day enrollment Subjects require chronic use immunosuppressive agent ( eg , methotrexate , cyclosporine ) Any investigational agent therapy &lt; = 30 day enrollment Prior therapy Irinotecan panitumumab . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
