	<brief_summary>Preliminary study show people diabetes undergo heart surgery may higher risk develop cognitive functioning problem , include memory problem , people without diabetes undergo heart surgery . Among people diabetes , however , control blood sugar level intensive way heart surgery may better neurological outcome use standard method control blood sugar level . This study compare effectiveness use traditional method blood sugar control versus intensive method blood sugar control heart surgery improve neurological outcome people diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>People diabetes undergo heart surgery great risk experience stroke develop cognitive functioning problem people without diabetes undergo heart surgery . There may connection disturbance glucose metabolism , endothelial dysfunction , poor neurological outcome heart surgery . People diabetes receive intensive blood glucose management heart surgery may better neurological outcome people control blood glucose level standard way . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness use traditional method control blood glucose level versus tailor , intensive method glucose control neurological outcome people diabetes undergo heart surgery . Researchers also examine genetic factor may associate insulin resistance inflammation . This study enroll people undergo heart surgery . On day surgery , participant undergo blood collection neuropsychological testing . They randomly assign either traditional method blood glucose control intensive , tailored method blood glucose control . Participants follow traditional method blood glucose control may receive insulin several time day , base result glucose monitoring . Participants follow intensive , tailored method blood glucose control undergo hourly measurement glucose level receive insulin adjustment need maintain glucose level 100-140 mg/dL . During surgery , participant undergo ultrasound neck monitor blood vessel activity . Additional blood sample collect surgery , 6 hour surgery , 24 hour surgery , upon hospital discharge 5 day surgery . One week surgery leave hospital , participant undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedure neuropsychological testing . Before leave hospital , participant take part diabetes education session nutrition counseling . Three 6 week 6 month surgery , participant undergo repeat neuropsychological testing . Once month 6 month , participant receive intensive , tailored method blood glucose control attend study visit time study researcher monitor diabetes .</detailed_description>
