	<brief_summary>We propose evaluate ixabepilone combination cyclophosphamide neoadjuvant treatment locally advance breast cancer . In regimen , ixabepilone substitute docetaxel , since preclinical clinical study suggest ixabepilone active either docetaxel paclitaxel . The combination ixabepilone cyclophosphamide could improve efficacy non-anthracycline neoadjuvant therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Cyclophosphamide Neoadjuvant Therapy HER-2 Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , patient early stage , HER2-negative breast cancer receive neoadjuvant treatment ixabepilone cyclophosphamide give every three week total six cycle . Following surgery patient hormone receptor-positive tumor receive anti-estrogen treatment . Patients may receive local regional radiation therapy surgery per institutional guideline investigator 's discretion . Baseline tumor tissue tumor tissue remove time surgery test Oncotype Detailed Description ( DX ) assay determine whether predictive response neoadjuvant treatment regimen . This study one first investigation combination ixabepilone cyclophosphamide neoadjuvant treatment HER2-negative breast cancer . It examine treatment regimen potential advantage gain substitution ixabepilone taxane use non-anthracycline agent .</detailed_description>

For patient , sentinel lymph node and/or axillary dissection prior initiation study treatment , completion least 4 week prior start study treatment wellhealed wound 15 . Bilateral , synchronous breast cancer allow one primary tumor meet inclusion criterion . 16 . Sufficient archive breast tumor specimen available baseline Oncotype DX assay . 1 . Inflammatory breast cancer . 2 . Peripheral neuropathy ( motor sensory ) ≥ grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 3.0 ( CTCAE v 3.0 ) . 3 . Prior radiation include ≥30 % major bone marrow contain area ( pelvis , lumbar , spine ) . 4 . Chronic use cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 inhibitor use follow strong CYP3A4 inhibitor : ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin , atazanavir , nefazodone , saquinavir , telithromycin , ritonavir , amprenavir , indinavir , nelfinavir , delavirdine , voriconazole . Use agent discontinue least 72 hour prior initiation study treatment . 5 . Chemotherapy within 5 year start study treatment except low dos agent use antiinflammatory indication rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , connective tissue disorder . Although dos schedule result myelosuppression , patient must discontinue therapy receive study treatment . 6 .
