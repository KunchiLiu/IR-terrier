	<brief_title>Augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster ( BFM ) Therapy Adolescent/Young Adults With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction : During Induction , receive augment Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster chemotherapy , make combination Cerubidine® , Daunorubicin Hydrochloride ( daunorubicin ) , Oncovin® ( vincristine ) , prednisone , dexamethasone , Oncaspar® ( PEG Asparaginase ) , MTX amethopterin ( methotrexate ) . All drug design interfere multiplication cancer cell cause die keep cancer come back . If find eligible take part study , Day 1 spinal tap procedure , give cytarabine injection spinal fluid . Within 3 day , begin Induction course , last 4 week . Daunorubicin vincristine give needle vein Days 1 , 8,15 , 22 . During first week therapy , give 1 infusion PEG Asparaginase vein . You take prednisone mouth Days 1-28 . Methotrexate inject spinal fluid Weeks 2 5 spinal tap . Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) study send spinal tap test fluid leukemia . If disease spinal fluid start treatment , give additional methotrexate dos week disease present . You continue receive methotrexate spinal tap every week 8 dos , monthly 6 dos . Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw multiple time study routine test . You bone marrow aspirate biopsy Days 15 29 need confirm remission . If less 5 % immature cell bone marrow , 1 week Induction , continue treatment Consolidation 1 . If achieve remission 4 week Induction treatment , treatment Consolidation 1 , discuss separate inform consent document . If LL bone marrow involvement screening , chest x-ray , CT scan , PET scan measure disease . Consolidation 1 phase chemotherapy discuss separate inform consent document . If still 5 % leukemia cell bone marrow Induction therapy , receive 2 extra week therapy call `` Extended Induction '' go next phase therapy . You receive daunorubicin vein Day 1 . You receive vincristine Weeks 1 2 vein . You take prednisone mouth Days 1-14 . You receive PEG Asparaginase vein first week Extended Induction . Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw weekly Extended Induction period routine test . At end Extended Induction period , physical exam bone marrow aspirate biopsy learn response treatment . After Extended Induction , disease remission , 1 course Consolidation 1 , 2 course Consolidation 2 , 2 course Consolidation 3 proceed Maintenance therapy . A separate discussion inform consent document Consolidation Maintenance provide . Length Study : You may remain study long benefiting . However , Extended Induction , disease remission , take study , doctor discus treatment option . You may take study disease get bad come back treatment , intolerable side effect occur , new information become available study doctor , doctor think best interest , attend appointment , schedule least every 3 month . This investigational study . The chemotherapy drug use study FDA approve commercially available . Up 125 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson . Consolidation Maintenance : During Consolidation , receive cyclophosphamide , cytarabine , 6-mercaptopurine , vincristine , PEG asparaginase , methotrexate , doxorubicin , 6-thioguanine , dexamethasone . During Maintenance , receive , vincristine , dexamethasone , 6-mercaptopurine , methotrexate . All drug design interfere multiplication cancer cell cause die keep cancer come back . If achieve remission 4 week induction treatment , treatment Consolidation 1 , Consolidation 2 , Consolidation 3 ( Parts A B ) , proceed Maintenance therapy . If level blast cell blood certain level Day 15 Induction achieve complete remission Day 29 , achieve remission 6 week induction plus extended induction , receive 1 course Consolidation 1 , 2 course Consolidation 2 , 2 course Consolidation 3 ( Parts A B ) , proceed maintenance therapy . Consolidation 1 last 8 week ( 2 month ) . You receive cyclophosphamide needle vein Weeks 1 5 . Cytarabine give injection beneath skin vein around Days 1-4 Days 8-11 month . 6-Mercaptopurine take mouth Days 1-14 month . Vincristine give vein Weeks 3-4 month . PEG Asparaginase give vein Week 3 6 month . You receive methotrexate needle spine weekly Month 1 . Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You spinal tap spinal fluid test intrathecal methotrexate dose . A spinal tap ( also call lumbar puncture ) special needle insert low back space bone draw sample fluid surround spinal cord . You bone marrow aspiration end Month 2 . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Consolidation 2 last 7 week . You receive vincristine methotrexate vein every 10 plus minus 2 day 5 dos . You receive PEG Asparaginase vein Weeks 1 4 . You receive intrathecal methotrexate Weeks 1 5 . You spinal tap spinal fluid test intrathecal methotrexate dose . Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw every 2 week routine test . Consolidation 3 ( Part A ) last 4 week . You receive vincristine Doxorubicin vein Weeks 1 , 2 3 . Dexamethasone take mouth Days 1-7 Days 15-21 . You receive PEG Asparaginase vein Week 1 . You receive intrathecal methotrexate Week 1 . Consolidation 3 ( Part B ) last 4 week . You receive cyclophosphamide vein Week 1 . You receive cytarabine vein injection 4 day row Weeks 1-2 . You take 6-Thioguanine mouth every day first 2 week . You receive intrathecal methotrexate Weeks 1 2 . You receive vincristine vein Weeks 3 4 . You receive PEG Asparaginase vein Week 3 . During Consolidation 3 ( Part A B ) , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw least weekly routine test . Spinal fluid test send intrathecal methotrexate dose . Spinal tap do intrathecal chemotherapy dose Once finish Consolidation , proceed maintenance therapy . The Maintenance period ALL patient last 24 month . If ALL , receive vincristine vein every month . You take dexamethasone mouth 5 day every month . You take 6-Mercaptopurine mouth daily . You take methotrexate mouth every week . You receive intrathecal methotrexate every 3 month first 12 month maintenance . You spinal tap spinal fluid test intrathecal methotrexate dose . Maintenance patient LL also last 24 month . If LL , receive vincristine vein every month . You take dexamethasone mouth 5 day every month . You take 6-Mercaptopurine mouth daily . You take methotrexate mouth every week . During Maintenance period , participant blood sample ( 1 3 teaspoon time ) drawn every 3 month routine test . If LL , additional positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan compute tomography ( CT ) scan end Maintenance period . Follow-Up Visits : Your study doctor inform follow-up visit clinic . At follow-up visit physical exam complete blood count . You followed-up next 3 year last dose chemotherapy . Length Study : You may remain study long benefit . You may take study disease get bad come back treatment , intolerable side effect occur , new information become available study doctor , doctor think best interest , attend appointment , schedule least every 3 month . This investigational study . The chemotherapy drug use study FDA approve commercially available . Up 125 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
