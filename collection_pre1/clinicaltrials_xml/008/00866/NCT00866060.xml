	<brief_summary>The trial examine whether pharmacological treatment donepezil , memantine combination memantine donepezil well placebo ( dummy ) treatment people Alzheimer 's disease reach moderate severe stage illness . Using double blind design , neither investigator participant know receive treatment , participant randomly assign one four treatment group ( donepezil memantine , memantine , donepezil placebo ) . In order keep investigator participant blind drug allocation double dummy design necessary . This mean participant receive 2 treatment âˆ’ either active form placebo 2 study drug . Hypotheses : 1 . Patients Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) continue donepezil beyond point transition moderate severe dementia continue show significantly less decline rating cognitive function activity daily live follow 12 month discontinue donepezil . 2 . Patients AD change memantine therapy place donepezil point transition moderate severe dementia show significantly small decline rating cognitive function activity daily live follow 12 month receive placebo . 3 . Patients give combination memantine donepezil point transition moderate severe dementia show significant additive synergistic benefit measure activity daily live cognitive function 12 month compare patient continue either drug single treatment .</brief_summary>

SMMSE = 5 13 ( 13 choose NICE threshold 10 plus 1 SD SMMSE score ) 2 . Continuously prescribed donepezil least 3 month 3 . Maintained 10mg donepezil previous 6 week . 4 . No change prescription psychotropic ( antipsychotic , antidepressant , benzodiazepine ) medication previous 6 week . 5 . Prescribing clinician considers ( base NICE guidance , discussion patient carer clinical judgement ) change drug treatment ( i.e . stop donepezil introduce memantine ) may appropriate . 6 . Patient community resident family professional carer visit least daily basis carer . 7 . Patient agree participate consider capable ( see section 7.5 ) 8 . Main carer ( informal professional ) consent involvement patient 's involvement To maximise generalisability study data , exclusion keep minimum . These include : 1 . Patient severe , unstable poorly control medical condition apparent physical examination clinical history . 2 . Patient already prescribe memantine . 3 . Patient unable take trial medication contraindication previous adverse allergic reaction . 4 . Patient involve another clinical trial . 5 .
