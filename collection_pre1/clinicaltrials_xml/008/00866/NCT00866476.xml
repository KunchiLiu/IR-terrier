	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study CVD 1208S , Live , Attenuated Oral Vaccine Prevent Shigella Infection : Phase IIa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study comprise Phase 2 vaccination study Phase 2b challenge study . The primary objective Phase 2 vaccination study : 1 . To evaluate , healthy volunteer , safety clinical acceptability three space dos ( one month apart ) investigational , live , oral , attenuated vaccine call CVD 1208S , particular attention occurence diarrhea , dysentery , fever , 2 . To characterize immune response follow ingestion vaccine . The primary objective Phase 2b challenge study measure protective efficacy 3 spaced dos vaccine ingestion oral challenge strain call Shigella flexneri 2a strain 2457T . Shigella lead cause disease death among child young 5 year live develop country . The difficulty control infection lead expert believe prevention use vaccine promising strategy . At CVD , pursue approach develop oral , attenuated Shigella vaccine prevents infection Shigella type great clinical epidemiologic importance . One strain include vaccine call Shigella flexneri 2a . Investigators CVD create vaccine Shigella flexneri 2a , designate CVD 1208S , use molecular biology technique . To date , nearly 40 subject receive varying dos vaccine good clinical tolerance modest immunogenicity . Previously single dose vaccine use . In current study , administer dos vaccine day 0 , 28 , 56 attempt maximize immunogenicity . Approximately one month 3rd dose , group ~15-20 vaccinate volunteer along similar number unvaccinated control subject admit CVD Research Isolation Ward SNBL challenge wild type Shigella flexneri 2a . By compare attack rate illness vaccinate vs. unvaccinated subject , determine vaccine 's ability confer protective immunity .</detailed_description>
