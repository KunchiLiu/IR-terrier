	<detailed_description>In currently ongoing retrospective aspect study , obtain pathologic tumor explant specimens tumor explant population 8/1/1994 12/31/2005 . We prepare 5-10 slide tumor explant block measure HIF-1α use immunohistochemical staining . We also perform retrospective chart review specific data point believe need assist u analysis histopathologic specimen . In addition , look data United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) database : www.unos.org , allow u develop thorough robust analysis subject 's experience liver cancer . This public , mandatory reporting vehicle government mandate transplant center report . Even subject transplant Northwestern , move , access UNOS data allow u see morbidity/mortality patient . Secondly , start enrol subject prospective fashion . Those either treat , currently undergo treatment , newly diagnose . From subject obtain informed consent ; ) look medical record ( current , future retrospective data ) , b ) collect blood specimens future analysis correlation explant slide data , c ) allow u follow subject indefinitely obtain ongoing outcome data , morbidity mortality information .</detailed_description>
