	<detailed_description>This double-blind , parallel assignment , randomize innovator control study . The subject investigate outpatient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) accord DSM-IV Chinese population . The screening phase last 1 week . The eligible patient enter next randomized treatment phase . The fix dose ( generic escitalopram 10mg/d Innovator Escitalopram ( Lexapro速 ) 10mg/d ) duration 2 week . After first 2 week , accord CGI investigator 's assessment patient administrate 2 different dose , one previous dose 10mg/d , high dose 20mg/d . In study , total duration last 8 week . The efficacy safety Innovator Escitalopram ( Lexapro速 ) treatment patient MDD confirm multiple double blind study . This study design evaluate efficacy safety genetic escitalopram treatment Chinese patient MDD . Therefore , double blind innovator control ( Lexapro速 ) design select study . The drug titration method dose within range specify instruction patient MDD tolerant drug practical clinical treatment . The purpose MDD patient treatment improve core symptom , prevent suicide , alleviate side reaction cause antidepressant , recover life function patient . Generally , treatment acute phase last 6 8 week . In study , treatment acute phase last 8 week . The rating scale use study standard psychiatric rating scale good validity widely use study antidepressant treatment patient MDD . The high inter-investigator reliability repeat measurement reliability scale ( HAMD , MADRS , HAMA ) prove multiple study . The clinical global impression ( CGI ) simple convenient global impression scale . It applicable patient treat studied psychiatric department . The VAS-PI ( Visual Analog Scale-Pain Intensity ) use evaluate reduction pain intensity , common symptom patient MDD . It good reliability validity . The Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS ) develop assess functional impairment three inter-related domain ; work/school , social family life .</detailed_description>
