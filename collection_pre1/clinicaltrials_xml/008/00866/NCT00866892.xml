	<brief_summary>Most pediatric laceration occur indoors considerably noncontaminated . Wounds occur outside house dirt often enter laceration , irrigation scrub soap proven effective decrease post-laceration infection . To date pediatric prospective study address less aggressive approach face scalp wound preparation pediatrics . We argue wipe wound sterile gauze soak sterile saline increase infection rate compare current practice . In emergency department , current standard care laceration aggressive wound preparation : irrigation scrub . This occur regardless wound contaminate . Research proven irrigation scrub unwarranted adult face scalp laceration . We want perform pilot/feasibility study compare two emergency campus . One campus serve control site , intervention site . In pilot study , goal demonstrate feasibility intervention provide data less aggressive approach wound preparation effective standard care . We hope project lead discussion manage noncontaminated laceration provide stepping-stone large , appropriate power study .</brief_summary>
