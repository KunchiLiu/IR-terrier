	<brief_summary>Intrathecal infusion pump increasingly use deliver analgesic chronic intractable pain . The PUMP II trial design evaluate ongoing safety efficacy new PrometraÂ® Programmable Pump System intrathecal administration morphine sulfate treat chronic intractable pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prometra 's Utilization Mitigating Pain II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development fully implantable system change dynamic risk associated intrathecal drug delivery . Pump reservoir could refill medication infrequently ( every 1-3 month ) , greatly reduce risk infection . Pumps initially drive pressure differential inject gas , push drug fix rate isolated chamber orifice predetermine size . Later , mechanical pump develop allow programmability different infusion rate , complex administration infusion preset bolus . These pump dominate US market long-term intrathecal drug delivery system ( IDDSs ) , expand range condition patient treat successfully . Because IDDSs characteristically deliver low flow rate drug intrathecal space ( &lt; 1 mL/day ) , reliability , durability , accuracy pump critical efficacy safety treatment . This continued access trial ass ongoing safety efficacy new fully implant IDDS , Prometra Programmable Pump .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient suffer cancer pain require strong opioids ( e.g. , fentanyl , methadone , levorphanol , hydromorphone , oxymorphone , oxycodone ) OR Patient chronic , nonmalignant pain OR Patient need implantable pump system ( pump AND catheter ) replace due malfunction battery depletion . Patient must document history sufficient pain relief intrathecal morphine sulfate infusion . 2 . Patient 18 year age old . 3 . Patient life expectancy &gt; 6 month . 4 . Patient documented failure respond less invasive method pain control , include attempt eliminate physical behavioral abnormality may cause exaggerated reaction pain . 5 . Patient pain ineffectively control single multiple systemic ( oral , rectal , transdermal intravenous ) analgesic treatment patient experience intolerable side effect treatment . 6 . Patient successful trial morphine sulfate ( intrathecal epidural ) relief target symptom . 7 . Patient agree obtain pain medication prescription investigator . 8 . Patient provide write informed consent participate study . 9 . Patient consider investigator medically psychologically appropriate candidate pump implantation . 10 . Investigator and/or study coordinator considers patient able willing fulfill study requirement . 1 . Patient exist damage spinal column observe via MRI spine , opinion Investigator , would prevent intraspinal drug administration ( e.g . cord compression metastatic tumor could obstruct catheter placement drug flow ) . If patient medical condition contraindicates MRI , investigator proceed close appropriate study ( i.e . CT scan , Xray ) rule spinal abnormality would prevent intraspinal drug administration . 2 . Patient systemic infection , opinion investigator , contraindicate implantable pump . 3 . Patient 's anatomy large enough accommodate pump 's size weight . 4 . Patient pregnant breastfeed childbearing potential employ effective birth control . 5 . Patient known allergy sensitivity pump system material ( e.g. , silicone rubber , titanium , polyphenylsulfone , acetal resin , polyvinylidene fluoride , tungsten ) . 6 . Patient known allergy morphine would contraindicate morphine , base drug label . 7 . Patient major coexist medical condition ( gastrointestinal problem , respiratory reserve / lung function problem , heart condition tolerate lower blood pressure ) , opinion investigator , contraindicate implantable pump . 8 . Patient require MRI evaluation postimplantation . 9 . Patient implant cardiac electronic device . 10 . Patient occupation he/she would expose high current industrial equipment , powerful magnet transmit tower , , electrician , electrical engineer MRI technician . 11 . Patient unable participate necessary study activity due physical mental limitation . 12 . Patient unable unwilling return require followup visit .</criteria>
