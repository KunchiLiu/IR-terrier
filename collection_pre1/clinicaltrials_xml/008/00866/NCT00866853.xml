	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether TMC435 influence activity certain drug-degrading protein human body . The drug-degrading protein investigate study belong Cytochrome P ( CYP ) family call CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 CYP2C19 . The activity drug-degrading enzyme determine measure blood level select set drug , take together TMC435 , , know specifically degraded certain member CYP family . This select set drug ( take together therefore call `` drug cocktail '' ) consider `` probe '' respective drug-degrading enzyme . By measure level probe human blood , activity degrade enzyme reveal . In way , determine TMC435 influence one way another activity one several select drug-degrading protein .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMC435-TiDP16-C107 : This Study Measures ( Possible ) Influence TMC435 Activity Selected Set Drug-degrading Proteins Measuring Blood Levels Drugs That Have Been Taken Together With TMC435 That Are Known Specifically Degraded These Drug-degrading Proteins .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label 2-period randomize cross-over trial 16 healthy volunteer . Eligible volunteer randomize 2 group . Volunteers Group A receive Period 1 single dose oral midazolam drug cocktail alone Day 1 2 , respectively ( Treatment A ) . In Period 2 , receive 150 mg TMC435 daily Days 1-11 single dose oral midazolam drug cocktail Day 10 11 , respectively ( Treatment B ) . Volunteers Group B receive Period 1 Treatment B Period 2 Treatment A . There period least 14 day two period ensure drug administer previous period degrade interfere measurement follow period . The cocktail consist midazolam ( administer intravenously ( abbreviate `` i.v . `` , mean directly inject blood vein . Injection occur period 1 minute via small tube ( canula ) bring blood vein ease slow injection drug ) , omeprazole , dextromethorphan , caffeine warfarin . Each drug degrade specific drug-degrading protein CYP family , therefore ideal tool reveal activity specific protein . The amount TMC435 , midazolam , cocktail drug ( metabolite , i.e . degradation product ) blood assess select time point . Safety tolerability coadministration TMC435 oral midazolam TMC435 drug cocktail assess throughout trial . Safety tolerability follow include assessment several blood parameter ( blood cell , biochemical activity certain protein , mineral , coagulation factor , … ) , several parameter urine ( blood cell , protein , glucose , … ) cardiac activity ( via electrocardiogram , blood pressure , pulse rate ) . Healthy volunteer receive treatment either A-B sequence B-A sequence . Treatment A consists oral midazolam ( 0.075 mg/kg ) Day1 cocktail ( * ) Day2 . Treatment B consist TMC435 ( 150 mg q.d . ) Day1-11 , oral midazolam ( 0.075 mg/kg ) Day10 cocktail ( * ) Day11 . ( * ) Cocktail : 0.025 mg/kg midazolam ( i.v . ) , dextromethorphan ( 30 mg , orally ) , caffeine ( 150 mg , orally ) , omeprazole ( 40 mg , orally ) warfarin ( 10 mg , orally ) supplement vitamin K ( 10 mg , orally )</detailed_description>
