	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate participant 's disease ( ovarian , primary peritoneal serous , fallopian tube , papillary serous endometrial cancer ) respond additional treatment Avastin ( bevacizumab ) . Participants already receive Avastin part maintenance therapy cancer . Maintenance therapy medical therapy give people prevent relapse . However , cancer may return maintenance therapy . This research study hop determine whether additional treatment Avastin effective treating participant 's cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avastin Patients With Epithelial Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal Serous Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary : To determine activity bevacizumab patient epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal serous , papillary serous endometrial fallopian tube cancer relapse achieve initial complete response first-line therapy include least 6 month bevacizumab maintenance define : 1 ) clinical response rate OR 2 ) clinical benefit response Secondary : - To assess duration progression free survival ( PFS ) - To assess safety - To correlate response Avastin-free interval STATISTICAL DESIGN : This study use two-stage design evaluate efficacy bevacizumab base patient achieve either clinical response clinical benefit response . The null alternative response rate 10 % 30 % . If two patient enrol stage one cohort ( n=10 patient ) achieve response accrual would proceed stage two ( n=19 patient ) . If response achieve least 6 patient final set 29 evaluable patient bevacizumab would deem worthy study . This design 80 % power give one-sided 0.05 significance level .</detailed_description>
