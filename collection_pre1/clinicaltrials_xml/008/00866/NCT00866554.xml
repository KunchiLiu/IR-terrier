	<brief_title>Efficacy Toxicity Bicalutamide Dutasteride vs. Standard Care Prostate Cytoreduction Brachytherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Permanent implant prostate brachytherapy recognize treatment method prostate cancer result least amount sexual side effect include erectile dysfunction ( ED ) . However prostate brachytherapy often limited patient prostate volume le 50cc dosimetric technical consideration . To counter fact patient prostate large 50cc offer neoadjuvant hormonal therapy reduce prostate volume value less 50cc . The pharmacological method often employed involves treatment LHRH agonist , also involve multiple adverse effect patient include ED majority patient . This approach may also involve disadvantage include possibility increase cardiovascular mortality possible increase urinary toxicity reduction health-related quality life patient treat neoadjuvant hormonal therapy . Despite thesis fact , neoadjuvant hormonal therapy remain essentially sole method use reduce prostate volume prior prostate brachytherapy . One study evaluate efficacy neoadjuvant regimen without LHRH agonist , comprise Dutasteride Bicalutamide reduce prostate volume . This treatment could theoretically fewer effect sexual function quality life could also possibly reduce urinary toxicity brachytherapy . Nonetheless , factor never evaluate . The cytoreductive efficacy Bicalutamide Dutasteride never directly compare standard treatment . The current study necessary determine effect neoadjuvant regimen Bicalutamide Dutasteride prostate volume , sexual function , urinary toxicity quality life compare standard treatment . If determine advantage Bicalutamide Dutasteride regimen could become standard care prostate cytoreduction prior brachytherapy .</detailed_description>
