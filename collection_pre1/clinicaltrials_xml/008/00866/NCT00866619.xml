	<detailed_description>The protocol post document update due protocol amendment date 23 January 2012 . An analysis time point add Month 20 . No change make protocol endpoint statistical method protocol endpoint analyse data collect Month 20 data available . The rationale full scope protocol define efficacy safety endpoint related primary schedule without booster age category follow 20 month earlier initially plan study end time point ( Visit 34 Month 32 time point ) . The protocol post document update due protocol amendment date 10 December 2010 extend study December 2013 enrol subject ( interval : Nov 2013-Jan 2014 ) . Including extension , mean follow-up time subject 5-17 month 49 month post dose 1 ( range : 41-55 ) , subject 6-12 week , 41 month post dose 1 ( range : 32-48 ) . This study double-blind first part single-blind extension part . An analysis conduct end extension include evaluation safety efficacy clinical malaria , severe malaria prevalent parasitemia . The protocol post document update follow post result study ( January 2015 ) : The study remain double-blind end extension phase , analyse Month 32 ( initial end study become end first part study primary study phase ) extension phase conduct together .</detailed_description>
