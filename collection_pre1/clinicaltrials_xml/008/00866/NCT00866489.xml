	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Brain ischemia injury commonly contribute perioperative morbidity mortality neurosurgery . Remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) phenomenon whereby brief period ischemia follow reperfusion one organ provide systemic protection prolong ischemia . To investigate whether remote precondition protects brain injury patient undergo elective neurosurgery , randomize trial perform current study . DESIGNING Thirty patient undergo craniotomy supratentorial meningioma randomize assign neurosurgery RIPC conventional neurosurgery ( control ) . Remote ischemic preconditioning consist three 5-min cycle right upper limb ischaemia , induce automate cuff-inflator place upper arm inflate 200 mm Hg , intervene 5 min reperfusion cuff deflate . Cerebral injury assess S-100b , NSE , neurological function score different time point . EXPECTED RESULTS RIPC reduce incidence cerebral injury . CONCLUSIONS : In patient undergo elective craniotomy supratentorial meningioma , RIPC reduce incidence postoperative cerebral injury .</detailed_description>
