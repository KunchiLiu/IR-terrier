	<brief_summary>Background : Parkinson 's disease affect 3 % person age 65 . Lower urinary tract symptom frequent cause diminish quality life elderly person occur 40 % person Parkinson 's disease . While exact mechanism determine , detrusor hyperactivity ( hyperactivity bladder muscle ) lead symptom overactive bladder urge incontinence common . Behavioral exercise-based therapy relatively side effect show effective treatment urge symptom overactive bladder age population . Hypothesis Specific Aims : Behavioral therapy use pelvic floor muscle exercise result 50 % decrease number incontinence episode elderly person ( age &gt; 50 ) Parkinson 's disease . The specific aim pilot study include follow : 1 . Complete course behavioral therapy use computer-assisted biofeedback 20 subject UI associate PD determine many potential subject need screen enrolled achieve sample size . 2 . Determine proportion patient achieve 50 % great reduction UI episodes . 3 . Examine whether responsiveness associate characteristic Parkinson 's disease , particular disease severity measure Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) . 4 . Assess effectiveness behavioral therapy without use computer-assisted biofeedback instruction 10 additional subject PD UI . Methods : The first 20 participant enrol 8-week treatment trial behavioral therapy pelvic floor muscle exercise computer-assisted biofeedback . Ten additional participant enrol 8-week treatment trial behavioral therapy , computer-assisted biofeedback . Voiding diary well urinary symptom quality life questionnaire use assess response . If person Parkinson 's disease complete treatment trial achieve reduction episode urinary incontinence behavioral technique would lay foundation large , placebo-controlled trial . Assessment responsiveness associate severity Parkinson 's disease would also provide important information utility treatment strategy .</brief_summary>
