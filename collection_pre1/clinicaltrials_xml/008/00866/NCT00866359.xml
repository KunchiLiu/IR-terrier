	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Apremilast ( CC-10004 ) Treatment Behçet Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group study equal randomization apremilast placebo treatment group . Following randomized Treatment Phase , participant enter active-treatment Extension Phase . The study consist four phase : Pre-randomization Phase , Treatment Phase , Extension Phase , Observational Follow-up Phase . Pre-randomization Phase Screening procedure must perform 90 day prior start study medication Visit 2 ( Day 1 ) . Treatment Phase Participants qualify randomization randomize 1:1 receive study medication ( apremilast ) placebo . Since incidence severity Behçet Disease differ male female , randomization stratify gender , minimize imbalance two treatment group . To mitigate potential gastrointestinal ( GI ) side effect apremilast ( primarily mild-to-moderate nausea ) , dose titration first week treatment implement study . Participants dose orally twice per day ( PO BID ) 10 mg apremilast identically-appearing placebo Days 1 2 , follow 20 mg BID placebo Days 3 4 , 30 mg BID placebo Days 5-7 . Thereafter , participant take 30 mg BID apremilast matching placebo Day 85 . If participant unable tolerate adverse event full dose study medication , may permit take reduce dose 20 mg BID apremilast investigator consults study sponsor . Participants dose reduce placebo medication receive identically-appearing 20 mg placebo tablet . Participants randomize Amendment 2 implement see regularly schedule visit Day 86 study medication discontinue another reason . Participants randomize prior implementation Amendment 2 re-consented next study visit schedule accordingly . Extension Phase On Days 86 91 , participant receive placebo Treatment Phase ( include `` dose reduce '' ) dose titrate 30 mg BID apremilast describe previously . Participants previously randomize apremilast ( include dose-reduced 20 mg BID ) continue receive apremilast dose Treatment Phase , use blister card identical appearance titration card . The study medication Days 86-169 remain blind , prevent study personnel participant know study medication assignment Treatment Phase . As Treatment Phase , dose reduction 20 mg BID apremilast permit investigator consults Celgene , participant unable tolerate adverse event full 30 mg BID dose . Participants randomize Amendment 2 implement see schedule visit Day 169 study medication discontinue another reason . Participants randomize prior implementation Amendment 2 re-consented next study visit schedule accord revise Schedule Assessments . Observational Follow-up Phase All participant ( include discontinue study medication prematurely reason ) follow 28 day last dose study medication monitor adverse event worsen disease study medication withdrawn . Participants randomize Amendment 2 implement see schedule visit Day 169 study medication discontinue another reason . Participants randomize prior implementation Amendment 2 re-consented next study visit schedule accord revise Schedule Assessments .</detailed_description>
