	<brief_title>Treatment HIV/HCV Coinfection With Peg-IFN Ribavirin Patients Receiving ART Monotherapy With Lopinavir/r</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Viral hepatitis , mainly cause hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , highly significant set infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) high activity antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) favorable impact upon morbidity mortality disease . HAART achieve disease control , significantly increase survival improve quality life subject HIV infection . Spain one high prevalence HIV-HCV co-infection HCV HIV infection strongly associate intravenous drug user ( IDU ) ; thus , 61 % 69 % subject infect HIV Spain also infect HCV . From 1998 , standard treatment chronic C hepatitis consist combination interferon alpha ribavirin , base increase efficacy versus interferon monotherapy ; however , development pegylated interferon , convenient bioavailability compare conventional interferon alpha , allow develop even effective combine therapy possibility improve response prediction base change viremia within first week treatment . However , treatment HCV infection usually involve severe side effect , often lead treatment discontinuation need adjust drug dosage , case treatment efficacy may decrease . HCV+ subject , HIV co-infection , also receive HAART , may increase number increase severity adverse reaction due interaction occur drug co-administration . Lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) potent HIV protease inhibitor characterize high pharmacological genetic barrier . Different study ( subject cohort , uncontrolled study ) past year appear literature show efficacy LPV/r control viral replication . Most study conduct soft gel capsule formulation LPV/r . In study , new formulation LPV/r ( Kaletra ) tablets approved FDA EMEA ( Spain authorization 30th Oct 2006 ) use . This new formulation provide additional benefit strategy study date soft gel capsule . Based forego additional cost saving involve strategy , think LPV/r , single antiretroviral agent concomitantly administer treatment hepatitis C virus infection may provide significant benefit would prevent interaction NRTIs ribavirin , thus potentially able decrease adverse event derive mitochondrial toxicity minimize possibility anemia . In addition , replacement NNRTIs LPV/r may significantly decrease CNS involvement may enhance co-administration efavirenz peg-interferon , minimize risk hepatotoxicity cause nevirapine .</detailed_description>
