	<brief_title>A Safety Tolerability Study Intracerebroventricular Administration sNN0031 Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tremor , rigidity , slow movement , poor balance , difficulty walk characteristic symptom Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) associate degeneration dopamine-producing nerve cell brain . Administration growth factor stimulate neuronal stem progenitor cell one possible approach restore dopaminergic activity . The drug product sNN0031 contain endogenous growth factor PDGF demonstrate reduce typical symptom animal model PD . NeuroNova intend investigate whether intracerebroventricular administration PDGF form drug product sNN0031 improve motor function patient PD . In first study safety tolerability treatment 2 week follow 10 week follow-up evaluate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female . Females either postmenopausal ( least 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea 6 month spontaneous amenorrhea FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL ) , surgically sterilize ( bilateral oophorectomy w/o hysterectomy ) , use adequate contraception ( oral contraceptive , intrauterine device double barrier contraception , i.e. , condom + diaphragm , condom diaphragm + spermicidal gel foam . ) duration study . Diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) moderate severity ( modify Hoehn &amp; Yahr Stage IIbIII ) . Effect duration oral Ldopa dose intake ≤4 hour Score ≥30 motor part ( part III ) UPDRS define ( &gt; 12 hour last dose intake ) Dopaminergic responsiveness least 33 % decrease UPDRS part III score administration Ldopa Disease duration least 5 year Age 30 75 year Stable antiParkinson treatment least 3 month Ophthalmologic examination normal finding regard vascular structure function MRI examination brain cervical spinal cord within 3 month anticipate implantation device finding tumor potential source pathological bleeding , abnormality may interfere assessment safety efficacy would , judgment investigator , represent surgical risk subject . Values coagulation parameter include platelet count , normalized prothrombin complex ( PKINR ) , activate partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) within normal range . The subject medically able undergo surgery require stereotactic implantation catheter infusion pump . Has give write verbal information , opportunity ask question study , understands time procedural commitment Signed consent ( write ) participate study Atypical form PD include repeat head trauma , drug toxininduced PD , neurological condition include ShyDrager syndrome ( multiple system atrophy ) , progressive supranuclear palsy , Wilson 's disease , Huntington 's disease , HallervordenSpatz syndrome , Alzheimer 's disease , CreutzfeldtJakob disease , olivopontocerebellar atrophy , posttraumatic encephalopathy Concurrent dementia score 20 low MMT rating scale Concurrent clinically significant depression score 16 high MADRS rating scale , equivalent moderate severe depression . Exposure neuroleptic drug block dopamine receptor within 6 month History structural brain disease include tumor hyperplasia History increase intracranial pressure Prior surgical procedure implantation device treatment PD Prior exposure formulation PDGFBB ( include topical ) Uncontrolled hypertension blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg systolic &gt; 90 mmHg diastolic . Any disorder precludes surgical procedure ( eg , sign sepsis inadequately treated infection ) , alters wind heal ( e.g . include bleed disorder ) , render chronic ICV delivery device implant medically unsuitable . Presence risk increase uncontrolled bleeding and/or risk bleed manage optimally . Physicians specifically investigate anatomical factor near implant site ( e.g. , vascular abnormality , neoplasm , abnormality ) , underlie disorder coagulation cascade , platelet function , platelet count ( e.g. , hemophilia , Von Willebrand 's disease , liver disease , medical condition ) , administration antiplatelet anticoagulant medication ( e.g. , aspirin , Plavix , NSAIDs ) pre perioperative period . Any condition drug could place patient increase risk intraoperative postoperative bleeding . Presence implant shunt drainage cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) implant central nervous system ( CNS ) catheter . Presence cardiac pacemaker , spinal cord stimulators , implantable programmable intraspinal drug pump , device may interfere interact programmer , without prior approval Medtronic . Clinically significant abnormality hematology clinical chemistry parameter assess investigator Ongoing medical condition accord investigator would interfere conduct assessment study . Examples medical disability ( eg , severe degenerative arthritis , compromise nutritional state , peripheral neuropathy ) would interfere assessment safety efficacy investigational product device performance , would compromise ability subject undergo study procedure ( eg , MRI , PET ) , give inform consent . Participation another clinical trial investigational drug device within 3 month prior Screening visit .</criteria>
