	<brief_summary>This study look inflammatory ( change usually associate infection/injury body ) bowel permeability ( bowel 's ability allow content enter body ) effect Western-style diet ( high fat low calcium ) prudent-style diet ( low fat high calcium ) colon ( large bowel ) . This study may provide information prevent colorectal cancer high-risk population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Western-type Diet Colorectal Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Compared prudent-style diet , western-style diet increase colorectal inflammation thereby increase gut permeability cause increase endotoxin marker systemic inflammation . This single blind crossover study . Subjects randomize begin either WD PD 30 + 3 day . Once dietary intervention complete , subject four ( 4 ) week wash-out period place dietary intervention 30 + 3 day . The follow study measure perform dietary intervention study period . All baseline test repeat end dietary intervention period .</detailed_description>
