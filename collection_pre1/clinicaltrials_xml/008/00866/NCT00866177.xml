	<brief_title>MEK Inhibitor AZD6244 Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response patient V600E V600K BRAF-mutated NRAS-mutated stage III stage IV melanoma low high phospho-pAKT expression treat MEK inhibitor AZD6244 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Identify genetic predictor sensitivity MEK inhibition . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord pAKT expression ( low vs high ) . Patients receive oral MEK inhibitor AZD6244 twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue sample collect correlative laboratory study . Samples assess expression pAKT , pPRAS40 , PTEN IHC mutation BRAF , NRAS , KIT , PIK3CAP MALDI-TOF . PTEN sequence tumor use whole genome amplification follow high-throughput bidirectional dideoxynucleotide sequence PCR-amplified gene product . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
