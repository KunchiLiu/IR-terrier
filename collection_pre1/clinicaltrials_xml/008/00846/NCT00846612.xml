	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study Avastin Doxil Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study registration clinicaltrials.gov divide 2 record . This record ( NCT00846612 ) pharmacokinetics Doxil . Another record ( NCT00945139 ) describe efficacy safety combination treatment . Treatment upon diagnosis epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) consist surgery achieve maximal tumor debulking follow platinum-based chemotherapy ( carboplatin + paclitaxel ) . Recently , optimally ( e.g. , &lt; 1 cm residual disease ) debulked patient appear benefit regimen include intraperitoneal administration cisplatin . While complete response ( CR ) frequently achieve , two year 50 % patient show sign recurrence . When EOC present advanced stage recurs , even CR achieve , longer totally eradicate . Nevertheless , number drug lead objective response , patient benefit prolongation survival . Anti-tumor activity Doxil ovarian cancer note phase I study , follow phase II study demonstrate activity platinum paclitaxel refractory disease . In expanded phase II experience University Southern California , responses Doxil occur preferably disease bulky few prior treatment . Typically , several cycle require maximum response , patient prolong stable disease . Subsequently , study Gordon et al establish preferred role drug formulation 2nd line-setting . It logical , therefore , build agent try improve outcome patient recurrent ovarian cancer , particular , consider combination Avastin , since Avastin show agent activity retrospective data recent study EOC . A combination Doxil Avastin several aspect interest ovarian cancer treatment : 1 ) independent single-agent activity , 2 ) enhance localization Doxil possible via increase half-life ( liposomal egress diminish ) decrease tumoral interstitial pressure , 3 ) improve Doxil distribution , 4 ) likely favorable toxicity profile since Doxil 's common problematic toxicity skin ( palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia PPE ) . Pharmacokinetic issue address select patient , compare cycle 1 ( without Avastin ) cycle 2 ( Avastin ) .</detailed_description>
