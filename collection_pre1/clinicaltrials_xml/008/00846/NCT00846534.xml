	<brief_summary>The purpose investigator study investigate correlation naturally occur chemical , call reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , blood human patient development abnormal heart rhythm , know atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . The development atrial fibrillation associate increase medical problem like stroke . Many factor seem cause development AF , rhythm occur frequently open heart surgery . When patient develop AF cardiac surgery increase risk cognitive change , infection , development kidney failure , increase length hospitalization . ROS chemical blood tissue tend cause microscopic blood vessel heart damage . These chemical occur naturally result chemical reaction occur state stress inflammation , like tissue trauma result smoking . Patients undergo cardiac surgery may high level ROS underlie medical condition . In addition , organize tissue trauma occur set surgery may serve increase ROS level . In turn , high ROS level may put patient even high risk development AF . The investigator believe increase level ROS may help potentiate patient 's development AF . Accordingly investigator aim measure ROS level surgery see particular level predict development abnormal heart rhythm . By develop good knowledge relationship ROS AF , investigator hope good understand another possible method detect patient high risk develop AF occur surgery . If patient well identify , may eventually lead medical treatment prevent AF ; hopefully result decrease malicious effect result develop abnormal heart rhythm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Assessment Oxidative Stress Markers Development Atrial Fibrillation After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) common occurrence cardiac surgery . This arrhythmia report occur 40 % patient follow coronary bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery . The incidence AF even high patient undergone CABG valvular surgery operation . In cardiac surgery patient , occurrence atrial fibrillation post-operatively lengthen hospitalization add postoperative complication like renal dysfunction , infection , cognitive defect . Postoperative AF known major risk factor development stroke cardiac surgery . Additionally , data suggest development AF cardiac surgery relate reduce survival CABG , dysrhythmia may also serve independent predictor long-term mortality . Many study investigate role prophylactic pharmacological therapy prevent post-operative AF cardiac surgery . Despite , complete pathogenesis AF post-cardiac surgery population remain unknown , likely multifactorial , include clinical , structural , biochemical risk factor . Biochemical risk factor inflammation elevate marker oxidative stress seem relate development AF . Also , It show AF associate decreased activity nitric oxide synthases . Elevated C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , common marker inflammation , show associated chronic AF one year follow . Additionally , elevate CRP level draw prior electrical cardioversion find predict development recurrent AF cardioversion . This relationship elevate marker inflammation - CRP - AF find independent clinical risk factor development AF , age , diabetes , leave ventricular function . Inflammation know source oxidative stress cellular level ; propose inflammation oxidative stress play role electrical remodel atrium , promote perpetuation AF . Moreover , propose CRP level may directly reflect condition increase oxidative stress . Oxidative Stress Arrhythmia : The association AF arrhythmias suggest array evidence . Moreover , pathogenesis likely involve change atrial architecture , dilation fibrosis , alteration electrophysiological substrate atrial tissue . Oxidative stress marker believe involved remodel atrial electrophysiological substrate . Recently , correlation AF oxidative stress marker establish . In one study , correlation oxidative stress marker reduce glutathione , cysteine , derivative reduce oxidative metabolite find . Although relationship AF oxidative stress remain unclear , know human population study oxidative stress marker elevate persistent AF . This relationship hold true even control condition promote oxidative stress : hypertension , smoking , congestive heart failure . It also show atrial tachycardia associate increase hydroxyl radical peroxynitrite . These specie believe cause myofibril damage reduce myofibrillar creatine kinase activity chronic AF . Similarly , superoxide free radical show elevated porcine heart leave atrial appendage subject rapid atrial pacing AF . Of interest study Dudley et al. , role NADPH oxidase inhibitor , apocynin , ability reduce superoxide production . This suggest NADPH oxidase play prominent role development reactive oxidative specie . In turn , reactive oxidative specie think related inflammation atrial electrical remodeling . It believe electrical remodel lead change shorten effective refractory period ( ERP ) , loss rate adaptation refractory period , prolonged atrial conduction . Rapid atrial conduction likely result increase calcium ( Ca2+ ) accumulation . This cause decreased inward L-type Ca2+ current ( ICa ) , result short action potential duration ( APD ) . Additional cellular mechanism may include inactivation fast sodium current ( INa ) positive membrane potential , increase inward potassium rectifier ( IK1 ) acetylcholine dependent potassium current ( IKAch ) . Though current logically oppose one another , net effect increase repolarization heterogenicity shorten APD . Moreover , experimental model show rapid atrial pacing lead decrease ERP reduce L-type Ca2+ channel transient outward K+ ion current . Shortening ERP lead decrease conduction wavelength , shorten wavelength propose increase propensity development AF reduce mass atrial tissue require sustain reentry circuit . Given change , postulate intracellular calcium overload result AF trigger electrical remodel AF . Nevertheless , study demonstrate blockade L-type calcium channel alone verapamil canine heart sufficient prevent atrial electrical remodeling . Additional trigger mechanism may include oxidative stress inflammation . Simvastatin , drug anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory property show attenuate development AF tachycardia induce atrial remodel dog . More specific evidence ion channel remodel free radical prove Caouette et al . show addition hydrogen peroxide directly delay ultra-rapid rectifier potassium current Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line . These change mediate Kv1.5 gene expression , account voltage-gated potassium repolarization current similarly express human atrial ventricular myocytes . Further ion channel study demonstrate lipid peroxidation cause Na+ channel dysfunction culture atrial myocytes expose oxidize agent tert-butyl-hydroperoxide . Additionally , believe reactive oxidative specie may promote respiratory chain dysfunction atrial myocytes way mitochondrial DNA damage . In summary , relationship oxidative stress atrial fibrillation complex incompletely understood molecular level . Nevertheless , clear relationship exist , therefore serve potential focus medical therapy . In fact , Carnes et al . clearly demonstrate use ascorbate perioperatively blunt effect oxidative stress result decrease peroxynitrite formation lower incidence AF CABG . Therefore , investigator propose work arena well elucidate relationship oxidative stress AF . Oxidative Stress Markers Research Setting : Cardiac surgery lead high oxidative stress inflammation associate postoperative AF . This ideal situation well define oxidative stress marker correlation AF . There several way measure oxidative stress human . A minimally invasive method measurement lipid peroxide ( derivative reactive oxygen metabolite , dROMs ) oxidize reduce thiol ratio . Glutathione important water-phase antioxidant essential cofactor antioxidant enzyme . It provide protection endogenous oxygen radical . Since glutathione exist oxidize reduced form , serve buffer increase oxidative stress . Moreover , relative amount two form reflection oxidative state human . This balance measure blood . Measurement ratio validate Neuman et al . know associated AF . Additionally , measurement validate state thought increase oxidative stress , diabetes , old age , cigarette smoking .</detailed_description>
