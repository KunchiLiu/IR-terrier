	<brief_title>Preventing Tolerance Oxymetazoline Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergic rhinitis ( AR ) affect upto 25 % worldwide population associate asthma , Scotland high prevalence world . Nasal blockage main symptom allergic rhinitis . Nasal blockage affect sleep quality impairs daytime performance . It major cause sickness absenteeism show adversely affect quality life .

Nasal steroid effective drug overall symptom allergic rhinitis consider first line therapy recent guideline . There widespread belief prolong use decongestant spray like oxymetazoline result condition decrease effectiveness call tolerance . It think time lose effectiveness medication need achieve level decongestion . Also propose stop , patient experience rebound congestion . Long term user nasal decongestant get spray vicious cycle . These spray act via stimulate alpha adrenoreceptors nose . It poorly understood condition mechanism action unclear . What also clear time onset tolerance . From study lung know tolerance certain type adrenoreceptors reverse use corticosteroid . We also see many year clinical practice concomitant use steroid spray decongestants prevents onset tolerance rebound . Anecdotally , patient often treat combination clinic particularly common cold , hayfever season high pollen count acute exacerbation . Therefore , would like conduct proof concept study show combination nasal spray decongestant steroid protect tolerance . We also show protection early rebound congestion . This enable new lease life allergic rhinitis sufferer , whose quality life affect nasal blockage absence effective long term drug strategy .</detailed_description>
