	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Rapid Test Prevent Hospital Transmission Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) strain become endemic pathogen acute chronic healthcare facility Belgium . MRSA infection cause increase public concern carry significant risk morbidity , mortality link substantial excess healthcare cost . Efficient control MRSA transmission within healthcare facility critically depend screen isolation MRSA carrier among admitted patient . Active surveillance culture MRSA part clinical practice recommendation Europe USA . Indeed , study indicate 70 % patient reservoir MRSA among hospitalized patient detect active sample muco-cutaneous colonization site . There urgent public health need early reliable detection carrier MRSA among patient admit healthcare facility , inform patient isolation decontamination procedure , thereby effectively control cross-infection The general objective intervention study conduct two large Belgian hospital measure impact rapid ( &lt; 3 h ) PCR detection MRSA carriage upon patient admission shorten delay implement contact isolation precaution carrier reduce nosocomial MRSA transmission patient admit ward .</detailed_description>
