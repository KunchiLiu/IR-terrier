	<brief_summary>Summary Study Rationale Near-infrared light ( NIR ) via light-emitting diode ( LED ) treatment promote retinal heal improve visual function follow high intensity laser retinal injury augment cellular energy metabolism , enhance mitochondrial function , increase cytochrome C oxidase activity , stimulate antioxidant protective pathway , promotes cell survival . LED directly benefit injure neuron retina , lateral geniculate nucleus , visual cortex , perception occurs . From public health perspective , Light-Emitting Diode ( LED ) Array study important conduct approve non-significant risk ( NSR ) device treatment eye disorder , low cost treatment , may serve effective , non-invasive alternative adjunctive treatment laser photocoagulation , current standard care DME . Study Objectives Hypotheses 1 . To determine effect short term ( 3 month ) near-infrared light ( NIR ) therapy anatomic functional abnormality diabetic macular edema assess visual acuity , optical coherence tomography , multifocal electroretinography ( mERG ) fundus bimicroscopy . 2 . To assess safety short term near-infrared light therapy eye diabetic macular edema .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; = 18 year Subjects &lt; 18 year old include DME rare age group diagnosis DME may questionable . 2 . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) • Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes Documented diabetes ADA and/or WHO criterion ( see Procedures Manual definition ) 3 . At least one eye meet study eye criterion . 4 . Fellow eye meet criteria . 5 . Able willing provide inform consent . 6 . Any candidate identify study investigator able successfully tolerate 3 month deferral laser photocoagulation . 7 . Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . 8 . Subjects poor glycemic control , within last 4 month , initiate intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) plan next 4 month enrol . 9 . Participation investigational trial within 30 day NIR participation involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry . • Note : subject receive another investigational drug participate study first 6 month ... 10 . Major surgery within 28 day prior participation major surgery plan next 6 month . • Major surgery define surgical procedure extensive fine needle biopsy/aspiration , placement central venous access device , removal/biopsy skin lesion , placement peripheral venous catheter . 11 . Subject expect move area 6 month study .</criteria>
