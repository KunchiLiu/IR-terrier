	<brief_summary>Background : - Popular weight loss strategy often involve reduce individual 's consumption carbohydrates fat . However , control study carry evaluate effect reduce carbohydrate versus fat consumption keep nutrient standard level maintain individual 's weight . Researchers interested investigate different restriction carbohydrate fat affect many process involve weight loss , include brain activity blood brain chemical composition . Objectives : - To determine comparative effect two control fat- carbohydrate-restricted diet outpatient weight loss program blood brain chemical composition , weight loss ( fat lean body mass ) , regional brain activity lean obese individual . Eligibility : - Healthy individual 18 45 year age either lean ( body mass index 18.5 kg/m ( 2 ) 25 kg/m ( 2 ) ) obese ( body mass index 30.0 kg/m ( 2 ) , weight less 350 pound ) right-handed . Design : - For obese participant , study consist four phase : initial 2-day screening visit follow two separate in-patient visit one set 12-week outpatient visit . For lean participant , study consist scan visit 2-day screening visit require overnight stay . - Lean participant - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , weight maintenance observation ( food diary physical activity monitor ) . - For scan visit , participant receive balance meal National Institutes Health consume 2 day visit . During scan visit , participant continue eat weight maintenance diet , complete questionnaire , series image study ( include positron emission tomography magnetic resonance imaging test ) evaluate brain response food stimulus . - Obese participant - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , weight maintenance observation ( food diary physical activity monitor ) . - During first inpatient visit , obese participant eat weight-maintenance diet 5 day establish baseline measurement . Following baseline diet , participant switch either reduced-fat reduced-carbohydrate diet next 6 day . After controlled diet , participant 3 day permit select food desire computerized vending machine system . Participants frequent blood test throughout visit . - After 10-week washout period , participant return second inpatient visit ( reduced-fat reduced-carbohydrate ) diet , test procedure . - After second in-patient visit , participant assign 12-week outpatient weight loss program goal achieve least 5 % weight loss . During program , participant continue blood test image study evaluate effect weight loss metabolism , brain reward circuitry , regional brain activity . - Participants available long-term followup yearly visit next 5 year follow weight loss intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Popular weight loss strategy often prescribe target reduction dietary carbohydrate fat . But surprisingly , control human feeding study ever investigate effect selective reduction dietary carbohydrate versus fat keep dietary macronutrients baseline weight-maintenance value . The present study design address knowledge gap improve understand selective reduction dietary fat versus carbohydrate may differentially impact many feedback control process act resist weight loss . After several day eat weight-maintenance diet , 20 obese adult volunteer ( BMI 30 kg/m2 ) admit metabolic clinical research unit ( MCRU ) , 5 additional day baseline diet , diet modify result either 85 % reduction baseline dietary fat 60 % reduction baseline dietary carbohydrate next 6 day . These diet modification produce equivalent caloric reduction . The primary outcome measurement change metabolism , brain reward circuitry regional brain activity response food stimulus measure baseline reduce calorie diet phase . Immediately follow control diet , measure 3 day ad-libitum food intake use computerized vending machine system . The subject return MCRU 2-10 week washout period receive opposite reduce calorie diet . Twenty control subject normal body weight ( BMI 18.5 - 25 kg/m2 ) measurement brain reward circuitry regional brain activity response food stimulus balance , weight-maintenance diet . Immediately follow second in-patient visit , obese subject assign 12 week out-patient weight loss program goal achieve least 5 % weight loss . We investigate relationship short-term fat imbalance measure in-patient phase , body weight fat change weight loss program . We evaluate effect weight loss metabolism , brain reward circuitry , regional brain activity response food stimulus . Finally , subject available long-term follow-up , investigate metabolic phenotype , brain reward circuitry , regional brain activity response food stimulus yearly subsequent 5 year follow weight loss intervention . This study result improve understanding physiological mechanism sense respond negative energy balance acutely , several week , several year , may eventually lead increase long-term success obesity treatment .</detailed_description>
