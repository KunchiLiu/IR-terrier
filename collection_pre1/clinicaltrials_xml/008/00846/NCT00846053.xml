	<brief_title>FDG-PET Imaging Young Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our recent study CF adult , supplement recent pre-clinical clinical study group suggest FDG-PET imaging may valuable quantitative biomarker lung inflammation . The propose study would validate early finding , young patient population . The implication test could highly significant test promise new anti-inflammatory agent patient management decision . To capitalize exciting opportunity , critical next step show identify cohort young CF patient stable lung function normal ( near normal ) FDG-PET image study . Similar patient , , would become subject future prospective cohort study determine FDG-PET image fact serve predictor future change lung function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis cystic fibrosis Age 12 21 year old , either gender , race ethnicity Stable recent pulmonary status ( define new pulmonary symptom , new antibiotic use , hospitalization pulmonary symptom least 1 month ) . We permit patient treat macrolide antibiotic , azithromycin , participate study . Azithromycin recently become virtual standard care CF [ 36 ] , base small reproducible improvement pulmonary function 4 month treatment drug . The mechanism benefit uncertain , antiinflammatory effect suggest [ 36 ] . The high prevalence use mean study without azithromycin would likely require washout period , without data appropriate duration washout , whether inflammatory marker would reverse time . Failure obtain informed consent Positive pregnancy test lactation Currently enrol another study involve radioisotope investigational drug Recent ( within 30 day screen ) hospitalization reason New antibiotic use ( within 30 day screen ) . Patient incapable lying still supine within PET/CT scanner 90 minute . Patient incapable complete test procedure ( e.g. , PFT , induce sputum ) Patient serum glucose great 150 mg/dl time PET image study Patient incapable fast 4 6 hr prior PET image study</criteria>
