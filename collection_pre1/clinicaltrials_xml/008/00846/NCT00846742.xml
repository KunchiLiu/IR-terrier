	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well combination chemotherapy without radiation therapy work treat young patient favorable-risk Hodgkin lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vinblastine , mechlorethamine hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , bleomycin , etoposide , prednisone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill cancer cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill cancer cell patient still residual cancer end chemotherapy . Giving combination chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill cancer cell allow doctor save part body cancer start .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Young Patients With Favorable-Risk Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) vinblastine IV day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ; mechlorethamine hydrochloride IV day 1 week 1 5 ; vincristine sulfate IV bleomycin IV day 1 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ; etoposide IV day 1 week 3 7 ; prednisone orally ( PO ) three time daily every day 8 week . Two 3 week chemotherapy give , patient achieve complete response undergo radiation therapy individual nodal site ( tailor field ) . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To increase complete response rate favorable risk patient ( exclude patient stage IA nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma ) 8 week Stanford V least 20 % compare favorable risk patient HOD 99 8 week vincristine , doxorubicin hydrochloride , methotrexate prednisone ( VAMP ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To estimate disease failure rate within radiation field . 2 . To examine pattern treatment failure child treat low dose tailored field radiation therapy . 3 . To describe acute hematologic infectious toxicity relate transfusion requirement , growth factor support , episode febrile neutropenia , hospitalization , accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 3.0 . 4 . To compare survival distribution ( event-free overall ) cumulative incidence local failure toxicity favorable risk patient treat 8 week Stanford V chemotherapy low-dose tailored-field radiation favorable risk group HOD 99 study receive VAMP low-dose involved-field radiation . 5 . To compare survival distribution patient prescribe radiotherapy 8 week Stanford V patient HOD 99 receive radiotherapy VAMP . 6 . To estimate event-free survival distribution favorable risk patient treat Stanford V chemotherapy alone patient treat Stanford V chemotherapy plus low dose tailor field radiation .</detailed_description>
