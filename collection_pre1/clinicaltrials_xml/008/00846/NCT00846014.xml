	<detailed_description>Asthma pulmonary disorder affect million people year . The exact method exacerbation still discussion . Currently cure disorder treatment wide variety . This study mean image asthmatic lung various time point post exacerbation . Since pulmonary image currently limit radiation technique , method allow exacerbate image without unnecessary exposure radiation .</detailed_description>
