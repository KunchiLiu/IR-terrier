	<brief_summary>This study look difference people evidence abnormal heart relaxation ( diastolic dysfunction ) sound wave picture heart ( echocardiogram ) compare . If abnormal relaxation , cause shortness breath present without know . A condition know oxidative stress mayb e associate abnormal relaxation . This condition occur abnormal oxygen injures heart cell . We would like learn patient abnormal relaxation increase oxidative stress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Introduction : The incidence congestive heart failure ( CHF ) increase significantly . Between 1971 1994 , crude hospitalization rate heart failure increase 8.2 33.8 per 1000 suggest mark rise prevalence condition.1,2 Furthermore , data Framingham study suggest incidence CHF double advance decade age 45.2 About 43 % individual CHF normal systolic function , diastolic heart failure.3 The occurrence diastolic heart failure frequent woman individual hypertension , coronary artery disease , obesity , diabetes mellitus associate significant increase mortality . Diastolic heart failure diastolic dysfunction common disorder , characterize delay ventricular relaxation increase diastolic stiffness absence systolic dysfunction . Nitric oxide ( NO• ) may contribute pathophysiology disorder well many process . In peripheral tissue , NO potent vasodilator produce endothelial cell think mediate vascular relaxation response acetylcholine , bradykinin , substance P. In multiple animal model study , endothelial production NO• disproportionately enhance diastolic leave ventricular function without substantial effect early systolic pressure development . This show ferret papillary muscle response Substance P recapitulate mouse model use cGMP analogue surrogate NO• . Both diastolic dysfunction diastolic heart failure intimately related hypertension . Recently , observe increase oxidative stress decrease NO• availability mouse model develop diastolic dysfunction . Specifically , deoxycorticosterone-induced hypertensive mouse , diastolic dysfunction develops , evidence endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) dysfunction prevent addition reduce cofactor , tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) . It well know hypertension associate increase oxidative stress BH4 oxidation . When BH4 oxidize , eNOS cease make NO• . We believe happen myocardium , lack cardiac NO• result diastolic dysfunction treatable BH4 supplementation . A corollary hypothesis human diastolic dysfunction oxidize case match control without diastolic dysfunction ( figure 1 ) . There several way measure oxidative stress human . Among convenient least invasive measure lipid peroxide ( derivative reactive oxygen metabolite , dROMs ) , isoprostanes , oxidize reduce glutathione ratio . Glutathione important water-phase antioxidant essential cofactor antioxidant enzyme . It provide protection endogenous oxygen radical . Since glutathione exist oxidize reduced form , serve buffer increase oxidative stress . Moreover , relative amount two form reflection oxidative state human . Recently , submit manuscript show effectively measure oxidative stress blood patient measure differentiate people without atrial fibrillation , abnormal heart beat grow evidence oxidative stress play role . Objectives : Based discussion , hypothesize patient diastolic dysfunction show high level blood oxidative stress case match control group . This test compare oxidative stress marker blood patient without diastolic dysfunction . The study design case-control format control match age ( decade ) , smoke , diabetes . If hypothesis true , could lead new , effective treatment cardiac diastolic dysfunction .</detailed_description>
