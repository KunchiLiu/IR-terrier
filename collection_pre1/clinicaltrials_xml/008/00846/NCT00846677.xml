	<brief_summary>Vitamin D supplementation ( 400 IU/d ) recommend breastfed infant Canada . Such recommendation ground fact prevalence rickets Canada higher desirable , likely due low maternal-fetal transfer low intake postpartum . There little data adherence supplementation Canada , one study show primiparous mother ( n=1937 ) Quebec , 58.1 % exclusively breast-feeding give infant vitamin D supplement first six month 62.1 % feed formula . For Canadian situation , clear modality supplementation barrier provide supplement . Thus overall aim study test new delivery system parental preference infant acceptance compare standard vitamin D supplement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Two Vitamin D Supplements Infants : Liquid Versus D-Strips</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES 1 . To determine parental preference new vitamin D delivery system standard care supplement syrup form . 2 . To determine infant acceptance new vitamin D delivery system standard care supplement syrup form . 3 . To establish possible barrier either supplement delivery system give infancy . METHODOLOGY Design : randomize cross-over design , open label . Visit 1 ( D1 ) : write consent , demographic survey first visit , randomize order supplement trial begin D Strip syrup drop . obtain infant weight , complete health survey , instruct use supplement Call 1 ( D4-D6 ) : telephone call address question concern , remind next visit . Visit 2 ( around D21 ) : complete survey instrument first supplement , obtain infant weight , complete health survey , instruct use second supplement Call 2 : ( D25-27 ) : telephone call address question concern , remind next visit . Visit 3 ( around D42 ) : complete survey instrument , obtain infant weight ; education regard continue use vitamin D. Demographics : Information related demographic obtain baseline research visit . This survey ( see appendix ) include question related parent education , income , knowledge vitamin D prior supplementation practice . This information important help understand parent background accept supplement delivery system . Delivery Systems : Both delivery system provide 400 IU vitamin D3 accordance Health Canada 's recommendation breastfed infant receive daily supplement dosage achieve food ( 1 ) . The standard delivery system syrup administer 1 ml volume use dropper . The syrup typically give pocket gum cheek slowly tongue . The new system D Strip small rectangular strip administer oral palate ( roof mouth ) , inner cheek , surface tongue readily adhere dissolve . Both give feeding . The standard liquid supplement commercially-available product . Protocol Testing : Parents newborn infant ask participate study . In total 50 infant studied baseline begin 2 4 week age follow total 6 week . At baseline Day 1 ( Visit 1 ) begin second study phase general health assessment questionnaire administer . This include maternal weight height plus infant weight overall health infant ( i.e . exist illness ) . Should infant unwell due infection common cold time , parent ask begin study 1 week later provide illness resolve . At Visit 1 , parent ask demographic information randomize either syrup group D Strip group . A registered nurse show parent take supplement . Then infant weigh already do enough supplement provide 3 week . The first dose supplement administer infant parent presence nurse . Parents inform care-call ( Call 1 ) make Day 4 6 study establish question concern . After 3 week ( i.e . around Day 21 , infant complete 21 day supplement ) parent infant return ( Visit 2 ) research site complete survey , infant weigh show administer supplement . Again enough supplement give parent inform care-call ( Call 2 ) 4 6 day supplement trial ( i.e . Day 25-27 ) . The first dose supplement administer infant parent presence nurse . After 3 week ( i.e . around Day 42 , infant complete 21 day supplement ) return final visit ( Visit 3 ) complete survey ( self-administered assistance ) infant weigh . At visit , end study , parent give education importance give infant vitamin D supplementation 400 IU obtain food . Two test approach use ( see appendix ) end study phase . First validate questionnaire use , medication acceptance scale ( MAS ) , use learn infant acceptance . The effectiveness infant acceptance medication deliver various modality test use MAS design validate pediatric oral liquid ( 21 ) . This scale us point scale generate observed behavior related 4 main area slightly modify use . The second approach administer parent preference questionnaire use Likert item response scale 1 10 . Compliance Record : To establish compliance give daily supplementation three approach take . 1 . Each supplement provide box label fix front upon parent initial every dosage give ; 2 . Parents ask frequency dosage study phase ; 3 . Parents ask return remain supplement end study phase . Either count D Strip weight syrup confirm appropriate number dosage give . Compliance primarily determine returned supplement count . If supplement return , parent recollection frequency dosage use .</detailed_description>
