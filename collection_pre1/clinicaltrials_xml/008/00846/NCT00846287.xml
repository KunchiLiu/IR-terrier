	<brief_title>Assessment Arformoterol Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Using Hyperpolarized 3He MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperpolarized Helium Lung image already test proven scientifically possible patient number pulmonary disorder . However limited data sensitivity imaging technique , would essential clinical use . This study double blind study two cohort , cohort make patient confirmed diagnosis COPD . One group receive placebo receive treatment . A comparison data resume twenty patient consent complete study procedure .</detailed_description>
