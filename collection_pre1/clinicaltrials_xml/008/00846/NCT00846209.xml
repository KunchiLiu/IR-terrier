	<brief_summary>Prior study document high prevalence patient misunderstand prescription drug warning label , place risk medication error . We seek evaluate effectiveness 'enhanced print ' drug warning improve patient comprehension beyond current standard.A three-arm , control clinical trial conduct . Patients assign receive 1 ) current standard drug warning label prescription container ( standard ) , 2 ) 'enhanced ' drug warning text rewrite plain language ( enhanced text ) , 3 ) enhance language icon develop patient feedback ( enhanced text + icon ) . Setting : Two academic two community health primary care clinic Chicago , IL Shreveport , LA . Patients : 500 adult patient consecutively recruit clinic .

	<detailed_description>Adult patient attend one four outpatient primary care clinic recruit two distinct city ( Shreveport , Louisiana ; Chicago , Illinois ) . One clinic city general medicine academic practice ; second clinic safety net community health center . Subject recruitment take place June August 2007 . Patients consider eligible study 18 year age old , ineligible clinic nurse study research assistant identify patient one follow condition : ( 1 ) severely impaired vision ; ( 2 ) hearing problem ; ( 3 ) ill participate survey ; 4 ) non-English speaking . Institutional Review Boards location approve study . A total 562 patient approached order arrive clinic prior medical encounter ; 530 consent study . Thirteen patient exclude base self-reported impairment hear ( n=3 ) vision ( n=10 ) . Ten patient exclude due limited English proficiency , seven others exclude base incomplete information . In , 500 patient participate study ; sample evenly split across two study location ( n=250 per city ) practice set ( academic , community ; n=125 within study location ) . A response rate determine follow American Association Public Opinion Research standard , estimate 92.8 percent approach eligible patient participate study.13 Intervention The intervention use 'enhanced ' auxiliary prescription drug warning label , without patient-centered icon support comprehension . Previously , nine commonly-used drug warning and/or precaution place directly prescription medication bottle revise patient feedback pilot tested.12 Specifically , text rewritten use clear , concise , explicit language . The icon support comprehension text message alter accurately reflect mental representation patient identify warn ( see Table 1 ) . Guidelines establish International Organization Standardization development test universal icon followed.14 Other design element also implement , include removal use color optimize font size clarity . Structured Interview A structure `` cognitive '' interview protocol develop assess patient understanding drug label ; process previously use research team.1-4,15 After patient consent study , train research assistant administer structure interview include self-report sociodemographic information ( age , gender , race/ethnicity , education , number prescription medication currently take daily ) . Actual prescription pill bottle container drug warn label attach show patient review . Once patient provide interpretation , research assistant administer Rapid Estimate Adult Literacy Medicine ( REALM ) , read recognition test comprise 66 health-related word . The REALM commonly use test patient literacy medical settings.16 It highly correlate standardized reading test Test Functional Health Literacy Adults.17 , 18 Assignment Nine drug warning use study . Each warn three version ( standard , enhance text , enhance text + icon ) combine total 27 label evaluation . Within label version , warning randomly organize group three label place back prescription bottle . We view three warning bottle realistic portrayal number warning commonly find pill bottle ; many pharmacy allot space many five per bottle ( see Figure ) . In total , nine bottle create ( three bottle per label version ) . The initial order warning back bottle ( e.g . first , second , third position ) also randomly assign replicate across label version ( see Figure ) . The bottle randomly group three set ; every set contain one bottle label version nine warning ( Table 1 ) . Patients thereby expose drug warning label type , see one version warning message . Consecutive patient schedule medical appointment clinic consent study subsequently assign , systematic rotate order , one three regimen review . Outcomes Patient attendance correct interpretation nine prescription drug warning place container vial evaluate . A trained research assistant location would direct patient back one three prescription vial , ask `` In word , mean ? '' The patient 's verbatim response document separate form . All patient response nine drug warning independently rat either correct incorrect three general internal medicine attend physician three different academic medical center . If subject attempt interpret one warning label response , cod 'non-attendance ' . Blinding Coding Each physician rater blind patient information train follow stringent cod guideline agree upon previously research team . Specifically , correct score give patient 's response include aspect label 's message . Responses give incorrect score inaccurate , contain aspect warn . Inter-rater reliability three physician cod patient response high ( Kappa = 0.87 ) . The 380 response ( 8.4 % ) receive discordant rating three reviewer send expert panel include primary care physician clinical psychologist health service researcher expertise health literacy review . Each panel member , also blind patient information , independently review coded response correct incorrect . For 86.1 percent ( n=327 ) 380 response , consensus ruling achieve among expert panel final ruling coding response . For remain 53 patient response , majority rule impose rating minimum two panel member use determine score .</detailed_description>
