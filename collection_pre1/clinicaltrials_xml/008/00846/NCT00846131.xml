	<brief_summary>A research study determine safety , efficacy , tolerability Therasphere® ( also know Y-90 , Y-90 Therasphere ) combine without sorafenib ( Nexavar® ) , patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC , liver cancer ) , await liver transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Y-90 Alone With Sorafenib Pre-Transplant Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) grow form new blood vessel liver transplant ( OLT ) offer best chance long term survival . However , grow number patient require OLT , prolong wait list time often lead drop transplant list due tumor progression . Some patient grant `` upgrade '' , within generally accept guideline transplant eligibility , order expedite access patient early HCC transplantation tumor progression . The use therapy like radioembolization also know Yttrium-90 ( [ Y-90 ] procedure small bead coat radiation inject directly tumor artery groin ) await OLT become common transplant center , include Northwestern , help patient reach transplant . Additionally , treatment use move patient status eligible transplant . We study whether combination approach systemic therapy therapy apply directly liver , successful single therapy . Angiogenesis ( process involve growth new blood vessel pre-existing vessel ) play important role early stage HCC . A decrease angiogenesis locally within treat tumor well exist tumor cell , yet detect , would hopefully decrease incidence post transplant recurrence HCC . All subject enrol study treat use Therasphere , Y-90 , compose nonbiodegradable glass microspheres coat radioactive compound Y-90 inject hepatic artery . The concentrated radioactive microspheres within tumor lead `` inside-out '' radiation . Half subject treat sorafenib ( NEXAVAR® ) conjunction Y-90 . The determination subject receive sorafenib make randomly , like flip coin . Sorafenib work slow growth tumor cell , attack tumor outside . Researchers hope determine whether subject treat sorafenib overall improve response liver direct therapy Y-90 Therasphere .</detailed_description>
