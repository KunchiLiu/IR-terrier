	<brief_summary>It purpose study compare kidney structure function old patient young patient removal single kidney transplant donation examine remain kidney 's ability adapt maintain function time . More specifically , aim examine effect uninephrectomy adaptive hyperfiltration remain kidney . A secondary aim investigate whether subject age population undergo compensation extent young subject . We also examine compensatory rise GFR ( glomerular filtration rate ) follow uninephrectomy group , , , compare result age versus young subject . This help delineate extent age population potential source live kidney donor kidney transplantation . It also purpose study refine test use donor evaluation process accurately identify ideal candidate safe kidney donation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening Procedures : Patients identify acceptance Stanford 's kidney transplant team appropriate candidate live kidney donation prior surgery . The following assessment perform course 4 year protocol . A . Informed Consent obtain . B . A Cimetidine Blocked 24 hour urine collection obtain prior surgery . C. DETAILED KIDNEY FUNCTION STUDIES perform use iothalamate , PAH three different time : 1 . Prior surgery uninephrectomy ( night month surgery ) 2 . 6 month 1 year post kidney donation . 3 . 4 year kidney donation . D. The Structure Kidney also assess three different time protocol : 1 . Cortical whole kidney volume determine use clinical MRI CT perform routinely kidney donor evaluation . 2 . At time surgery , operate room : A single wedge biopsy kidney take morphometric later genetic analysis . *NOTE : Genetic analysis genetics age disease . In procedure , small wedge kidney biopsy excise direct visualization transplant surgeon kidney remove donor kidney transplant recipient . The area excision oversewn check bleeding . The size ( volume ) Tx kidney measure water displacement graduate cylinder immediately Tx . This volume use calculation estimate number glomerulus youthful vs age kidney . 3 . A second MRI CT obtain 6 month 1 year kidney donation measure kidney 's overall compensatory growth increase cortical volume comparison pre-operative volume .</detailed_description>
