The aim determine optimal time perform bronchoscopy group patient . The primary outcome change therapy determine addition removal antibiotic , antifungal , antiviral steroid etc . well oncologist 's opinion impact bronchoscopic result care patient . Patients follow throughout hospitalization well receive phone call 3 month hospital discharge . Written consent obtain patient health care power attorney relevant case . It hope result study help good define role bronchoscopy management Bone Marrow Transplant patient .</detailed_description>
