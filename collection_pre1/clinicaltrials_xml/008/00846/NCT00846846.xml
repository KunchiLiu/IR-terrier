	<brief_title>PROTECT Continued Access Post Marketing Surveillance Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , non-randomized , single-arm , open-label post market surveillance study design expand safety information patient treat Endeavor® Zotarolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System . Since introduction , Drug Eluting Stents ( DES ) markedly decrease stent restenosis clinical need repeat revascularization frequently observe bare metal stent ( BMS ) 1-10 . However , widespread use DES raise concern regard occurrence late stent thrombosis ( &gt; 30 day stent implantation ) 12-14 . Although incidence might seem low ( 0.2-0.7 % ) 13,15-18 high mortality morbidity associate stent thrombosis , soar number stent implant annually , make significant medical problem . The purpose trial investigate long-term clinical safety efficacy Endeavor drug elute stent large high risk patient population , closely reflect clinical practice today . Both unstable stable patient single multivessel disease complex lesion eligible enrollment . The selected primary endpoint stent thrombosis , define definite probable stent thrombosis accord ARC definition , 3 year . The main secondary endpoint composite death cardiac death combine large non-fatal myocardial infarction , typical clinical manifestation stent thrombosis . These event adjudicate clinical event committee . 1.2 Study Endpoints 1.2.1 Primary Endpoint : The overall stent thrombosis rate define definite probable stent thrombosis accord ARC definition 3 year 1.2.2 Secondary Endpoints : Main Secondary Endpoints include : - Composite endpoint total death number patient non-fatal myocardial infarction 3 year - Composite endpoint cardiac death number patient non-fatal myocardial infarction 3 year - Composite endpoint total death number patient large non-fatal myocardial infarction 3 year - Composite endpoint cardiac death number patient large non-fatal myocardial infarction 3 year Additional secondary endpoint include : - Total Death subcategories Death - Large Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) - Stent thrombosis define definite , probable possible - Composite score clinical outcome ( death , myocardial infarction , stroke revascularization ) * - Major Adverse Cardiac Cerebral Events ( MACCE ) - Stroke ( hemorrhagic nature clopidogrel ) - Bleeding complication general - Target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) - Target vessel revascularization ( TVR ) - Non target vessel revascularization ( non TVR ) - Procedural success - Device success - Lesion success - Endpoints calculate follow-up time point mean follow-up period . - The composite score clinical outcome ( death , myocardial infarction , stroke revascularization ) construct patient population accord Delphi method .</detailed_description>
