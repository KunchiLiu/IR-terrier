	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation common cardiac cause ischemic stroke . Detecting atrial fibrillation stroke TIA critical highly effective secondary stroke prevention therapy available individual recognize atrial fibrillation . However , atrial fibrillation likely under-diagnosed stroke TIA atrial fibrillation often difficult detect frequently paroxysmal asymptomatic , patient routinely undergo prolonged screening . The purpose study determine diagnostic yield novel 30-day cardiac event monitor compare repeat 24-hour Holter monitor detect occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patient recent ischemic stroke TIA undetermined etiology completion standard clinical stroke work-up ( include initial negative Holter monitor . )</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion : 1 . Diagnosis index event* make stroke specialist acute ischemic stroke TIA ( WHO definition ) undetermined etiology ( cryptogenic ) occur within previous 6 month ( 180 day ) .The event must either : embolic arterial ischemic stroke confirm neuroimaging ; transient ischemic attack , define involve focal unilateral motor deficit , speech/language deficit , hemianopia , symptom duration &lt; 24 hour ( note : amaurosis fugax/transient monocular blindness , pure sensory spell , isolate vertigo spell , etc . qualify enrolment give potential misdiagnosis event ) . 2 . Patient meet follow : At least one 12lead ECG already obtain part routine clinical poststroke/TIA workup , ECGs show episode atrial fibrillation atrial flutter , ; A Holter monitor already obtain part routine clinical poststroke/TIA workup , show episodes atrial fibrillation atrial flutter â‰¥30 second . 3 . The patient actively investigated etiology stroke/TIA event additional cardiac monitoring desire screen possibility occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter , i.e . patient select study investigator , his/her clinical judgment , would consider order repeat Holter monitor part clinical care . 4 . The following diagnostic test already complete part clinical routine poststroke/TIA : brain image CT MRI , vascular image extracranial intracranial circulation either CT angiography MR angiography exclude significant large vessel occlusive disease likely mechanism index ischemic event ( carotid Doppler ultrasound acceptable present anterior circulation ischemic event ) , transthoracic ( transesophageal ) echocardiography exclude thrombus structural heart disease opinion investigator likely cause stroke/TIA event . [ Note : If baseline echocardiogram obtain clinically index event prior study enrollment , acceptable study purpose echocardiogram obtain patient enrollment study prior 90day followup visit . Alternatively , echocardiogram already perform within one year prior study enrollment may serve baseline echocardiogram study purpose . ] 5 . Age 55 year old [ Note : Participants aged 5559 year image confirmation index stroke/TIA event embolic imaging pattern acute cerebral ischemia ] 6 . Informed consent patient ( legally authorize representative patient competent , e.g . due strokerelated cognitive impairment , aphasia , anosognosia ) . 7 . The patient expect survive least 6 month . 8 . The patient valid provincial health insurance number . The index event define event lead medical presentation Exclusion : 1 . Any previously document atrial fibrillation atrial flutter , i.e . past history atrial fibrillation/flutter atrial fibrillation/flutter detect ECG , Holter , telemetry follow index stroke/TIA event ( remote history transient perioperative atrial fibrillation exclusionary 2 . Exclusively retinal stroke TIA event . 3 . A responsible etiological diagnosis qualify stroke/TIA event already determine , i.e . probable smallvessel ( lacunar ) disease , probable large vessel disease , cervicocephalic artery dissection , venous sinus thrombosis , hypercoagulable state , know cause . 4 . Planned carotid endarterectomy within 90 day . 5 . Patient already currently participate clinical trial involve investigational medication device . * 6 . Any finding echocardiography already evidencebased indication longterm anticoagulation ( e.g . mechanical heart valve , thrombus , etc. ) . 7 . Endocarditis 8 . Pacemaker ICD device . 9 . Patients know skin reaction synthetic polymer silver . ( Some people display sensitivity silver jewellery sensitive impurity present silver alloy silver . These people may participate . )</criteria>
