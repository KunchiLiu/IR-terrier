	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine whether treatment acarbose attenuate post-prandial glycemic excursion non-diabetic/pre-diabetic obese child determine continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) . To effect current pilot study involve 6 week intervention acarbose give subject either impaired glucose tolerance area curve &gt; 130 mg/dl screen oral glucose tolerance test . Three consecutive day CGMS compare intervention . The secondary objective address protocol collection baseline measure endothelial function obese lean child . Even though duration acarbose treatment may short demonstrate vascular effect , pre post intervention data would serve preliminary data anticipate future study ass vascular effect reduce post-prandial blood glucose level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We particularly interested examine whether acarbose lowered percentage glucose excursion â‰¥ 140 mg/dl real-life , home environment . At baseline , subject underwent oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) 72 hr out-patient continuous glucose monitoring . They treat acarbose ( 50 mg meal three time daily ) 6 week repeat 72 hr CGMS profile obtain end study .</detailed_description>
