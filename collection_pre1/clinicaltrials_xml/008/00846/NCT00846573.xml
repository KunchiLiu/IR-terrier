	<brief_title>Hyperpolarized Noble Gas MR Imaging Pulmonary Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current pulmonary imaging technique clinically regulate machine produce radiation . MR produce radiation possible due low concentration fluid open space lung . With hyperpolarized noble gas use safe technique MR image view airway lung , thus limit human exposure radiation . This technique already proven possible human subject insufficient data show efficacy clinical setting . This study design image variety pulmonary disorder well find possible clinical us hyperpolarized gas MRI .</detailed_description>
