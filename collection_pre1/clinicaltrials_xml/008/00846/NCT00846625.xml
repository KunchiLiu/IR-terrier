	<brief_summary>This pilot study investigate safety efficacy intravitreally administer ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) compare steroid injection treatment macular edema due chronic non-infectious uveitis . There currently FDA-approved therapy condition , however intravitreal injection corticosteroid , conjunction oral steroid and/or immunomodulatory drug agent , become mainstay therapy . Ranibizumab recombinant monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment neutralizes active form vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , believe contribute etiology inflammation neovascularization . Ranibizumab FDA-approved treatment neovascular age-related macular degeneration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Uveitic Macular Edema Treated With Ranibizumab Steroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proof concept study assess safety potential efficacy ranibizumab patient population . Since common clinical practice perform regional periocular injection steroid patient uveitic macular edema , patient refractory periocular steroid enrol study . The 0.5 mg dose ranibizumab give intravitreally since dose route find safe efficacious prior study . A dose regimen establish ranibizumab patient uveitis , patient assess treat monthly need . Triamcinolone 4mg intravitreal injection steroid treatment , patient also assess monthly retreat every three month need .</detailed_description>
