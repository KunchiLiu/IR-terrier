	<brief_title>Endoscopic-vacuum Assisted Closure Intrathoracic Postsurgical Leaks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrathoracic leakage serious complication esophageal surgery . The reported incidence esophageal anastomotic leak gastrectomy esophagectomy range 5 % almost 30 % . Within last 10 year endoscopic treatment change approach intrathoracic anastomotic leakage . Application metal clip , injection fibrin glue placement self expand metal plastic stent ( SEMS/SEPS ) report successfully achieve closure postoperative anastomotic leak approximately 66-100 % . Alternative endoscopically treatment modality welcome especially case failure mention endoscopic treatment modality prevent necessity surgical reintervention associate high mortality mutilate surgical outcome proximal diversion cervical esophagostomy . Vacuum-assisted closure ( V.A.C . ) establish treatment modality extensive cutaneous infected wound . The V.A.C . system device base negative pressure apply wound via vacuum seal sponge tissue . The sponge result formation granulation tissue , vacuum remove wind secretion reduces edema therefore improves blood flow , together achieve consecutive wound closure . Since introduction late 1990Â´s number indication V.A.C . system steadily increase . Recently endoluminal application vacuum assist wound closure system closure rectal anastomotic fistula report . Our group report successful closure intrathoracic anastomotic leak two case endoscopic placement vacuum assist closure system . Here plan study efficacy , safety long term outcome E-V.A.C . treat major intrathoracic postsurgical leak .</detailed_description>
