	<brief_summary>Brain metastasis occur 20-40 % patient primary extracerebral tumor . Despite important advance therapy malignant solid tumor treatment 1-3 brain metastasis , multiple brain metastasis continue present significant problem attempt prevent progression disease limit morbidity associate therapy . The majority patient develop brain metastasis short survival , effective palliation transient . The median survival diagnosis low 3-6 month . However , evidence select patient survive prolonged period vigorous therapeutic approach . Specific therapeutic option surgery , chemotherapy , conventional fractionate whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) radiosurgery . Radiosurgery allow deliver single high dose fraction radiation target 3-3.5 cm maximum diameter . In patient newly diagnose brain metastasis , rapid decrease symptom , local tumor response rate 73-90 % median survival 7-12 month report . WBRT alone treatment choice patient multiple brain metastasis , patient single brain metastasis amenable surgery radiosurgery . Median survival WBRT alone 3-6 month . WBRT radiosurgery boost show improve survival RPA class I patient patient favorable histological status squamous cell non-small cell lung tumor . All randomized trial show improved local control addition radiosurgery WBRT ( Andrews , 2004 ) . WBRT conjunction radiosurgery improve local control reduces risk new distant brain metastasis , study support combine radiosurgery WBRT improve overall survival expect patient without evidence extracranial disease . Helical Tomotherapy ( HT ) allow sole modality new treatment option : Using HT , advantage apply highly conformal boost dose metastasis WBRT combine one treatment session . Therefore , allow apply high dose multiple brain metastasis sense integrate boost . The focus study investigate efficacy safety WBRT integrate boost use new treatment modality comparison effect conventional WBRT alone . The principal objective trial ass therapeutic efficacy WBRT compare WBRT combine integrated boost HT deliver patient 2-10 brain metastasis solid tumor . The secondary objective evaluate safety WBRT oppose WBRT combine integrated boost deliver HT patient 2-10 brain metastasis .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm extracranial primary malignancy small cell lung cancer , germ cell tumor lymphoma . Histological confirmation may primary tumor site , another metastatic site , metastatic brain lesion ( ) 410 brain metastasis , radiologically proven MRI scan . The size metastasis must 3 mm 4.0 cm large diameter . Contrastenhancements MRI small 3 mm diameter consider . The total volume lesion must small 35 ml volume perilesional normal brain receive 4 Gy per fraction must small 40 ml . An evaluation latter criterion strongly recommend total lesion volume &gt; 20 ml prior randomization patient accord figure 1 . OR 23 brain metastasis , radiologically proven MRI scan . The size metastasis must 3 mm 4.0 cm large diameter . Contrastenhancements MRI small 3 mm diameter consider . The patient consider good candidate stereotactic radiosurgery +/ whole brain radiotherapy . Each lesion distance margin chiasma opticum optic nerve &gt; 5 mm . Male female , Age 18 year old Laboratory requirement : hematological status must document . Platelets &gt; 30 x 109/l . If platelet 30 x 109/l correction transfusion indicate entry study accord institutional guideline . Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl . If anemia present extent hemoglobin le 8 g/dl correction transfusion and/or erythropoietin indicate entry study accord institutional guideline . Before patient registration , write informed consent must give accord ICH/GCP national regulation . Lesions locate medulla oblongata brainstem . Leptomeningeal metastasis meningosis carcinomatosa . If meningosis carcinomatosa suspect MRI , presence tumor cell liquor cerebrospinalis must exclude prior study entry . Chemotherapy within 1 week prior study treatment Need systemic chemotherapy control primary disease extracranial metastasis within 3 week study treatment ( assessed randomization ) Prior treatment brain metastasis chemotherapy resection brain metastasis ( 210 measurable lesion remain ) , prior cranial radiotherapy Severe coagulopathy Medical illness psychiatric impairment would prevent completion protocol therapy Female patient pregnant time enter study . Women must agree betaHCG pregnancy test possibility pregnancy believe exist . Women men child bear potential admit trial advise treatment receive may teratogenic advise take adequate measure prevent conception . Participation clinical trial within 4 week prior registration .</criteria>
