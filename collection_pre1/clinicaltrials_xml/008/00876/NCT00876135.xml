	<brief_summary>The prevalence airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) high elite swimmer , reach 80 % certain study . Repeated Chlorine-derivatives exposure may major causative factor development . Asthma diagnosis generally make basis clinical characteristic . The demonstration variable bronchial obstruction positive expiratory flow reversibility bronchodilator , spontaneous variation airway obstruction positive provocation test ( methacholine , eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoeaâ€¦ ) necessary avoid false diagnosis . Currently asthma treatment swimmer general population . A short-acting bronchodilator often prescribe avoid occasional symptom , combine inhaled corticosteroid antagonist Leukotriene asthma symptom persistent . Previous study show reduced efficiency asthma medication elite athlete compare non-athletes . The specific response different medication remain studied athlete . The effect short-acting bronchodilator swimmer AHR , especially asymptomatic , pulmonary function performance yet study . Moreover , significance positive bronchial provocation test remain studied asymptomatic swimmer AHR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis swimmer positive bronchial provocation challenge necessarily exercise-induced bronchoconstriction swimming use bronchodilator unnecessary . Chlorine-derivatives exposure may responsible weakness epithelium layer warm humid atmosphere swimming-pools may protective development bronchoconstriction . Thus also hypothesis field test outside swim pool , swimmer develop exercise-induced asthma , need take bronchodilator prevention .</detailed_description>
