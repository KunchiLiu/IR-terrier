	<brief_summary>The aim study compare diagnostic value non-invasive vascular imaging tool establish vascular diagnostic method PAD order get prognostic data . A high sensitivity Fluorescence angiography order recognize progression critical limb ischemia could lead earlier therapeutic intervention thereby increase limb salvage . A diagnostic gap would close .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Clinical Significance Fluorescence Videoangiography With Indocyanine-Green</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) occur peripheral microcirculation impair arterial stenosis occlusion . In opposite early study evaluate intermittent claudication due peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , rest pain trophic change affect extremity due reduce microcirculation . Though main reason CLI exist PAD , many process responsible pain pad-associated symptom trigger reduced microcirculation attempt enhance dermal perfusion pharmacological manipulation may ameliorate result vascular treatment . These attempt may best option patient , vascular surgery successful primarily impossible . A Laser-induced fluorescence videoangiography currently use ophthalmology display vessel eye background . Due technical improvement , become standard procedure . This trial aim establish laser-induced fluorescence videoangiography standard procedure vascular surgery . This would benefit patient technique require use ionise radiation possible patient suffer renal failure .</detailed_description>
