	<detailed_description>Invasive fungal infection major cause morbidity mortality immunocompromised patient . Among , patient hematological malignancy , neutropenic patient , human immunodeficiency virus infect patient , diabetic , solid organ transplant patient patient admit intensive care unit particularly high risk . The survival patient depend early diagnosis prompt appropriate antifungal treatment . The early diagnosis infection difficult lack sensitive test method , notably blood culture . Its sensitivity poor close-zero aspergillosis . In addition , response time several day . For reason , decide develop real-time PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction ) assay blood sample . It allow rapid response establish positive negative diagnosis invasive fungal infection , could contribute strongly decision treat use antifungal , monitor effectiveness optimization antifungal prescription . Methods : Our project multicentre prospective inter-regional collaborative work Nice , Rennes Toulouse Mycological parasitological laboratory . Our objective : First , validate extraction method blood infect fungi specie . The three laboratory work together determine best extraction method , since consensus method extraction nucleic acid fungal origin context human infection . The numerous extraction technique already use lead difference PCR result . As consequence , inter-laboratory comparison easy . Secondly , aim develop three real-time PCR assay : A panfungal real-time PCR assay able detect fungal specie responsible human disease ; real-time PCR assay targetting Candida albicans one target Aspergillus fumigatus two clinically important pathogen . Then patient blood sample ( classify accord EORTC consensus ) collect study order evaluate validate method clinical sample . Results allow u determine sensitivity , specificity reproducibility , negative predictive value . Objectives Overall , work aim evaluate clinical impact real-time PCR early diagnosis invasive fungal infection initiation stop antifungal therapy . The economic impact result use method evaluate . Indeed , excellent predictive negative value panfungal real-time PCR assay could warrant decrease use empirical antifungal therapy</detailed_description>
