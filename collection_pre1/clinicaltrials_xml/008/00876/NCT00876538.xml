	<brief_title>Effect TRO19622 Treatment Patients With Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy represent frequent invalidate side effect require treatment . Current treatment option multiple , none yet demonstrate efficacy double-blind clinical trial . This study provide information useful determine potential TRO19622 relieve pain dysesthesia common symptom experience patient peripheral neuropathy follow taxane chemotherapy . At start study , patient randomize one two group : TRO19622 ( 330 mg QD placebo day ) . Each treatment administer 6 week . Additionally , patient option continue treatment another 6 week duration . Treatment administer double-blind condition . The product evaluation administer patient receive standard care CIPN .</detailed_description>
