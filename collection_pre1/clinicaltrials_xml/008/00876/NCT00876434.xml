	<brief_summary>Background : - Uveitis inflammatory condition patient 's immune system attack eye , cause eye inflammation vision loss . Patients uveitis may treat immunosuppressive medication reduce inflammation prevent vision loss . - Sirolimus immunosuppressive medication approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) prevent organ rejection follow kidney transplant . Researchers think sirolimus may affect part immune system may important cause uveitis , may decrease inflammation cause uveitis . - In study , sirolimus give injection outer layer eye . The FDA permit investigational use sirolimus study . Objectives : - To determine subconjunctival injection sirolimus safe treatment uveitis . - To see sirolimus effective treatment uveitis . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age older active uveitis one eye . If patient uveitis eye , one inflammation worse treat study . The vision study eye must least 20/400 . - Patients must good liver function , must willing practice sun protection measure 2 week follow treatment . Design : - Treatment sirolimus study eye : - Antibiotic numbing eye drop give sirolimus injection . - 1 dose sirolimus inject directly subconjunctiva ( white part eye ) . - Antibiotic drop give topical application 3 time per day 2 day injection . - Patients follow 16 week sirolimus injection ( initial visit follow-up visit Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 ) . - Evaluations treatment period follow-up visit : - Physical examination , include vital sign body weight check , pregnancy test woman become pregnant . - Full medical ophthalmic history , involve questionnaire discussion researcher . - Eye examination , dilation , photography , include measurement retinal thickness fluorescent dye test blood flow eye . - Blood urine test . - Because increase risk skin cancer associate sirolimus , patient ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Uveitis refers intraocular inflammatory disease important cause visual loss . Standard systemic immunosuppressive medication uveitis cause significant adverse effect many patient continue experience disease flare-up . Sirolimus suppress cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation thus , inhibits production , signal activity many growth factor relevant uveitis . Subconjunctival sirolimus administration could reduce eliminate need topical and/or systemic immunosuppressive drug could result reduce morbidity . This protocol investigate subconjunctival sirolimus possible treatment active anterior uveitis . Study Population : Five participant active anterior uveitis initially accrue study . Participants must require treatment uveitis systemic and/or topical anti-inflammatory medication high frequency interval [ great equal three time daily ( T.I.D . ) ] local steroid treatment ( periocular steroid injection ) contraindicate significant intraocular pressure ( IOP ) elevation local steroid treatment past ( i.e. , steroid responder ) , least grade 1+ anterior chamber cell visual acuity least 20/400 study eye . Up seven participant may enrol , two participant may accrue replace enrolled participant withdraw study prior receive study medication . Design : This Phase I , non-randomized , prospective , uncontrolled single-center study evaluate subconjunctival sirolimus treatment active anterior uveitis . All participant receive single 30-microL ( 1,320 microg ) subconjunctival sirolimus injection study eye baseline follow 16 week post-injection . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome number participant experience least 2-step reduction anterior chamber inflammation within four week post-injection . Secondary outcome include change visual acuity anterior chamber inflammation grading , number participant experience disease flare within 16-week study duration , participant experience disease flare , number day disease flare baseline . Secondary outcome also include presence extent cystoid macular edema .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant ability understand sign inform consent document . Participant 18 year age old . Participant 's uveitis consider active current regimen . Participant diagnosis noninfectious anterior uveitis require treatment control intraocular inflammatory disease systemic and/or topical antiinflammatory medication high frequency interval ( great equal T.I.D . ) local steroid treatment ( periocular steroid injection ) contraindicate significant IOP elevation local steroid treatment past ( steroid responder ) . Participant anterior uveitis least grade 1+ anterior chamber cell 1 study eye . Participant visual acuity study eye 20/400 better ( ETDRS equivalent ) . Participant normal renal liver function , bad mild abnormality define Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v3.0 ( CTCAE ) . Participant history intraocular surgery within three month prior study enrollment agrees undergo elective ocular surgery ( e.g. , cataract extraction ) duration study . Participant absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 750/mm ( 3 ) Participant able undergo full ophthalmic examination assessment anterior chamber cell . Participant understands increase risk skin cancer sirolimus usage agree practice skin protective measure two week follow injection . Skin protective measure include : 1 ) stay direct sunlight , especially hour 10:00 a.m. 3:00 p.m. , possible ; 2 ) wear protective clothing , include hat sunglasses ; 3 ) apply sun block product skin protection factor ( SPF ) least 15 ( participant may require product high SPF number , especially fair complexion ) ; 4 ) apply sun block lipstick SPF least 15 protect lip ; 5 ) use sun lamp tan booth bed . Participant willing able comply study procedure . Female participant childbearing potential must pregnant breastfeeding , must negative urine pregnancy test screening must willing undergo urine pregnancy test throughout study . Both female participant childbearing potential male participant able father child must agree practice two form adequate birth control throughout course study three month postinjection . Acceptable method birth control include hormonal contraception ( birth control pill , inject hormone vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide ( diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide ) surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , tubal ligation vasectomy ) . Participants hysterectomy vasectomy ( partner hysterectomy vasectomy ) exempt use two method contraception . However , female participant tubal ligation ( male participant female partner tubal ligation ) exempt , require practice another acceptable method birth control . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant significant active infection ( infection require treatment determine medical team ) history chronic recurrent infection . Participant history cancer ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) diagnose within past five year . Participant use latanoprost ( Xalatan ( Registered Trademark ) ) within two week prior study enrollment likely need point study determine investigator . For participant active anterior uveitis eye , participant 's nonstudy eye anticipate require periocular steroid anticipate increase systemic immunosuppressive treatment include steroid may require course study . Participant medium opacity preclude assessment anterior chamber inflammation . Participant active joint systemic inflammation require immediate addition increase systemic antiinflammatory medication .</criteria>
