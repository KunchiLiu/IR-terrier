	<brief_title>Assessing Screening Plus Brief Intervention 's Resulting Efficacy ( ASPIRE ) Stop Drug Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy screen brief intervention ( SBI ) drug use among primary care patient unknown . National organization recommend universal screening . But policy odds evidence : federal effort disseminate SBI underway , reimbursement code compensate clinician develop . Thus need study SBI drug use . The objective study determine efficacy two model brief intervention ( BI ) decrease drug use consequence primary care patient . In collaboration state project implement SBI part federal program , screen patient large hospital-based primary care practice drug use . We enroll screen-positive subject , randomly assign 1 3 group , follow 6 month . Subjects 1 intervention group assign standard BI model , conduct trained health advocate implement Federal program locally . In another group , subject assign enhanced BI model include optional booster contact conduct master's-level counselor train monitored intensively . The control group receive information ( i.e. , write list local resource help people use drug ) , end six month , standard BI still use drug . All subject assess regard substance use consequence , HIV risk behavior , cost , healthcare utilization receipt substance dependence treatment . The primary outcome drug use 6 month ; secondary outcome drug use consequence , include HIV risk behavior , receipt substance dependence treatment ( among dependence ) . We hypothesize standard BI enhance BI great efficacy screen resource information alone decrease drug use , decrease drug use consequence HIV risk behavior increase receipt treatment dependence . Additionally , cost also compare . Results study : efficacy cost brief intervention drug use essential making decision disseminate drug use SBI primary care setting . This study enroll two cohort : 1 . We enroll 450 subject ASSIST Substance-Specific Involvement ( SSI ) Score 4 great order test primary hypothesis . Primary analysis ( i.e. , effect BI unhealthy drug use ) restrict subject ASSIST SSI Score 4 great . 2 . We enroll additional 200 subject ASSIST SSI Score 2 3 , indicate , low risk drug use . Patients score include clinical intervention , data effectiveness literature , cohort include primary analysis instead include secondary exploratory analysis . We examine potential preventive effect BI ( either ) subject low level drug use .</detailed_description>
