	<brief_title>Etoricoxib Acute Soft Tissue Rheumatism Affecting Shoulder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective clinical trial assessment efficacy safety two single daily oral dos etoricoxib 60 mg 90 mg period 14 day treatment patient acute soft tissue rheumatism affect shoulder . The study perform accord randomise , double blind , double-dummy , parallel-group . In study include 300 male female out-patients , age 18 year , acute episode soft tissue rheumatism affect shoulder ( le 5 day ) . The main inclusion criterion : Shoulder pain acute onset non-traumatic origin , history painless unrestricted motion affect joint immediately acute attack , acute one-sided shoulder pain cause soft tissue rheumatism , patient-assessed pain active movement exceed 50 mm 100-mm visual analogue scale symptom require therapy NSAIDs . The main exclusion criterion : Active recurrent peptic ( gastric duodenal ) ulcer , history peptic ulcer gastrointestinal bleeding , history bleed disorder gastro-intestinal , concomitant treatment anti-coagulants , lithium , NSAIDs ( include aspirin dos &gt; 150 mg ) corticosteroid , local injection steroid affect shoulder ( six month previous ) , presence form crystal , destructive , infectious inflammatory arthropathy , osteonecrosis , previous shoulder surgery affect side , adhesive capsulitis , cervical radiculopathy , severe renal , cardiac hepatic failure , uncontrolled hypertension , pregnancy breast feeding , confine bed , plan hospital stay surgical procedure trial , plan surgical intervention affect shoulder trial , alcohol drug abuse inability comply protocol . The study 4 Visits , Day 1 ( Visit 1 ) , Day 3 ( Visit 2 ) , Day 7 ( Visit 3 ) Day 14 ( Visit 4 ) . Potentially eligible patient screen Visit 1 . Patients find eligible allocated one two treatment ( etoricoxib 60 mg 90 mg ) . Each patient treat 14 day . Early termination study Visit 3 ( Day 7 ) possible case complete resolution symptom . All procedure study must do patient sign inform consent . An ultrasound X-ray evaluation affect shoulder do Day 1 haematological biochemistry laboratory evaluation do Day 1 end treatment . The primary end-point efficacy patient 's assessment pain active movement Day 3 , secondary end-point ( ) efficacy : Patient 's assessment pain active movement last 24 hour , patient 's assessment pain rest , Brief Pain Inventory , final global assessment efficacy patient end treatment , final global assessment efficacy investigator end treatment , withdrawal due inadequate efficacy , patient 's status ( change painful condition end therapy ) paracetamol consumption use rescue medication . The secondary end-point ( ) safety tolerability : Incidence intensity adverse event , final global assessment tolerability patient , final global assessment tolerability investigator , incidence laboratory-related adverse event , withdrawal patient due adverse event . The result tabulate analysis data perform order evaluate efficacy dose etoricoxib ( 60 mg 90 mg ) equally effective treatment acute shoulder pain syndrome due soft tissue rheumatism affect shoulder .</detailed_description>
