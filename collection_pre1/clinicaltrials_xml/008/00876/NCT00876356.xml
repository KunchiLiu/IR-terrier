	<brief_summary>Conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA ) naturally occur free fatty acid derive tissue milk ruminant animal cow . CLA multiple biological property include regulation metabolism immune process , include tissue inflammation . Asthma symptom cause irritation inflammation airway . Our hypothesis CLA may reduce airway inflammation asthma thus reduce asthma symptom . The aim pilot study investigate efficacy safety CLA dietary supplement mild asthma . Subjects assign take CLA dietary supplement placebo ( olive oil ) 12 week addition usual asthma treatment . They monitor asthma symptom , side effect , lung function blood marker inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Health Benefits Conjugated Linoleic Acid ( CLA ) Asthma &amp; Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Purpose You invite participate study effect natural supplement , conjugate linoleic acid ( CLA ) , allergy asthma . Previous study show CLA may control type inflammation find allergy asthma . CLA find dairy product , however amount find varies greatly depend cow feed reduce dramatically last 30 year . The estimated daily intake CLA 15 174 mg/day , effective dose CLA 3000 4000 mg/day 70 kg adult . Therefore take CLA supplement may beneficial . This first formal study look whether CLA benefit people allergy asthma . Study Procedures If qualify study agree participate , randomly assign ( like flip coin ) one two group . The two group : Conjugated linoleic acid ( active substance ) twice daily 3 month Placebo ( inactive substance ) twice daily 3 month Neither study doctor know whether receive CLA placebo . There change asthma medication prescribe regular physician . Your physician make aware participate study . Your participation study involve 6 visit laboratory , 2 hour duration . The study run 3 month . At 4 visit , happen every 4 week , ask perform spirometry sputum induction . Spirometry breathe test require take deep breath blow hard fast . From measure baseline airway function . This take 15 minute , side effect routinely perform test patient clinical pulmonary function laboratory . Sputum induction involve inhalation mist salt water help produce deep cough sputum sample deep chest . This take 30 minute . You give pretreatment bronchodilator medication , inhale mist least 1 , 3 , 7 minute period . Then ask cough sputum chest , sample cup . Inhalation mist cause cough sore throat pretreatment bronchodilator minimize side effect . Spirometry repeat inhalation mist detect change airway size , bronchoconstriction . If bronchoconstriction occur , immediately give bronchodilator reverse . The sputum analyze marker inflammation characteristic asthma . At visit also approximately 25 mL ( 2 tablespoon ) blood take analyzed marker inflammation call cytokine . You also answer questionnaire determine asthma allergy affect daily living . You undergo physical exam receive education control asthma properly use inhaler . At begin study end study ask come another visit methacholine challenge breathe test . The challenge involve breathe mist contains bronchoconstrictor ( methacholine ) perform spirometry measure flow volume air lung . You breathe several different mist , increase concentration bronchoconstrictor , change flow measurement find . This test measure sensitive airway take 1 hour . You may feel tightness chest and/or wheeze result challenge , give bronchodilator medication reverse effect bronchoconstrictor . You closely monitor spirometry ensure safety test . Risks The potential side effect CLA minimal . In previous human study main complaint gastrointestinal disturbance ; mainly bloat increase gas . 12 % people receive CLA complain gastrointestinal disturbance , compare 6 % people receive olive oil placebo . If female childbearing potential pregnant nursing involve study , effect CLA embryo fetus know . If become pregnant study must inform study personnel immediately study treatment discontinue . Confidentiality All data collect regard kept secure database McDonald Research Wing , access authorize individual study . No personal information name address include database ; identify code number . These investigation research ; individual result return doctor . Participation study completely voluntary . You may refuse participate , may withdraw study time without prejudice medical treatment . Benefit There may direct benefit participate study , help u advance knowledge lung disease benefit future patient . Compensation You compensate time effort payment $ 25 screen visit $ 50 set study visit ( sputum induction breathe test ) .</detailed_description>
