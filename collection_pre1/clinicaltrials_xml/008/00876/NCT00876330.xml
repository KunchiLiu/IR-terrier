	<detailed_description>The quality care deliver physician ' office suboptimal . Underuse proven , potentially life-saving medication , anti-hypertensive agent statins lipid-lowering , unfortunately exception . Data 70 million people collected 2005 HEDIS Report Card show few half patient high risk myocardial infarction adequately control lipid few 70 % patient hypertension blood pressure control ; annually suboptimal treatment account 10,000 avoidable death , $ 333 million avoidable hospital cost , 27.2 million sick day $ 4.5 billion lose productivity . The `` care-gaps '' management blood pressure lipid arise numerous barrier optimal practice level system , provider , patient . Process evaluation quality improvement effort cite several barrier important : inadequate time , resource , support ; limitation computer technology , include insufficient information management ; little use formal change process ; many compete priority ; lack agreement desire change ; inadequate physician engagement . Both computerized clinical decision support ( CDS ) context robust electronic health record ( EHR ) automate telephone outreach patient interactive voice recognition ( IVR ) patient promise intervention overcome barrier physician patient encounter treat hypertension hyperlipidemia . While recent study begin demonstrate effectiveness CDS ambulatory setting , urgent need implement evaluate system practice physician practice solo small group community , outside extensive HIT infrastructure academic medical center integrate delivery system . IVR patient-outreach intervention involve automate telephone call patient patient conversation specific health-related issue . Randomized control trial ( RCTs ) show IVR monitor clinician follow-up improve self-care , perceive health status , physiologic outcome among individual diabetes hypertension . The specific aim project evaluate , effectiveness CDS alone compare IVR improve use antihypertensive lipid-lowering medication community-based primary care practice .</detailed_description>
