	<brief_summary>Some cancer patient start new chemotherapy regimen likely develop blood clot , also know venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) . Blood clot cause symptom occasionally life-threatening . The purpose study determine daily injection blood-thinner , dalteparin , 12 week safely effectively reduce frequency blood clot . Dalteparin currently approve prevention blood clot follow surgery hospitalize patient specifically cancer outpatient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Dalteparin Prophylaxis High-Risk Ambulatory Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VTE increasingly frequent complication cancer anti-cancer therapy . It associate increased mortality significant adverse consequence . Risk factor VTE cancer population identify , multiple study also show VTE prevent high-risk population use thromboprophylaxis . This study evaluate safety efficacy prophylaxis high-risk subgroup cancer patient identify validated risk model develop u previously call `` Khorana Score . '' Correlative study evaluate value tissue factor predictive biomarker VTE . The purpose study conduct prospective , randomized clinical trial compare safety efficacy prophylaxis dalteparin treatment reduce VTE high-risk ambulatory cancer patient initiate chemotherapy establish value TF predictive marker VTE ambulatory cancer patient receive chemotherapy . PHACS randomize multi-center clinical trial . Eligible patient enrol underwent baseline screen ultrasonography low extremity rule pre-existing DVT chest CT scan rule PE . If negative , patient randomize receive either dalteparin 5000 unit subcutaneously daily observation study period 12 week . The first day dalteparin prophylaxis coincide first day initiation new systemic chemotherapy regimen . The patient see every 4 week ( ±1 week ) time regularly schedule chemotherapy cycle visit serial ultrasonography low extremity study period ( i.e . 4 , 8 12 week . ) A chest CT scan perform 12 week . Compliance measure ask patient missed dos 4-weekly visit well ask patient fill injection diary .</detailed_description>
