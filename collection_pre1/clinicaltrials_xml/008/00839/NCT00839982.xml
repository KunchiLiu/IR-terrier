	<brief_title>Clofarabine Cytarabine Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes That Have Relapsed Not Responded Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral clofarabine give LDAC ( cytarabine ) patient age &gt; = 60 previously treat AML high risk MDS . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate , disease-free survival ( DFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) therapy oral clofarabine LDAC previously treat AML high-risk MDS . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study clofarabine follow phase II study . Patients receive clofarabine orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-5 low-dose cytarabine subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-10 SC QD day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21-28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
