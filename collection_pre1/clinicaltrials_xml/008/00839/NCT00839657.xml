	<brief_summary>Individuals take warfarin often need frequent dose change international normalized ratio ( INR ) get high low could result high risk thromboembolism , bleed early discontinuation highly useful therapy . This study compare two approach warfarin dose examine utility use genetic information warfarin dosing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clarification Optimal Anticoagulation Through Genetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective Clarification Optimal Anticoagulation Genetics ( COAG ) trial conduct 1,022 participant , multicenter , double-blind , randomize trial compare two approach guide warfarin therapy initiation : 1 ) initiation warfarin therapy base algorithm use clinical information individual 's genotype use gene know influence warfarin response ( `` genotype-guided dosing '' ) , 2 ) initiation warfarin therapy base algorithm use clinical information ( `` clinical-guided dosing '' ) . The study hypothesis use genetic clinical information select dose warfarin initial dose period lead improvement stability anticoagulation ( AC ) relative strategy incorporate clinical information ( without genetics ) initial dosing . Each study arm include baseline dose initiation algorithm dose revision algorithm apply first 4 5 dos warfarin therapy . By compare two strategy trial , study able determine genetic information provide added benefit beyond glean simply clinical information . This study proof-of-concept efficacy trial . Efficacy defined measure whether , optimal application , dose algorithms lead improvement care . The trial thus answer question : `` use clinical plus genetic information lead improvement anticoagulation control beyond use clinical information initiation warfarin , apply uniform optimal manner patient ? '' Because efficacy yet establish genotype-guided dosing warfarin , important first test whether approach , indeed , improve anticoagulation outcome control condition .</detailed_description>
