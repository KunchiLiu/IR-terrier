	<brief_title>Effect 10,000 EU Dose Endotoxin Allergic Mildly Asthmatic Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty-four forty-eight hour ( study day 1 ) prior inhalation challenge , subject undergo physical examination ear , nose , throat chest assessment vital sign ( temperature , pulse , respiratory rate , blood pressure ) , oxygen saturation , symptom score assessment undergo spirometry rule acute illness prior challenge . All female volunteer undergo urine pregnancy test . A similar examination take place immediately prior inhalation challenge 10,000 EU CCRE , well 30 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 300 360 minute 24 hour challenge ( exception pregnancy test administer prior sputum induction study day 1 ) . Induced sputum 24 48 hour prior challenge , six hour challenge Study day 2 . Sputum analyze PMN content , CD14 expression airway macrophage monocyte , soluble CD14 level , cytokine level sputum product inflammatory cell ( eosinophil , cationic protein , myeloperoxidase ) . Blood collect CBC differential pre- challenge induce sputum obtain 6 hour challenge . Subjects escort GCRC overnight admission . While GCRC , vital sign obtain every 2 hour till bedtime , shift . Spirometry obtain subject GCRC , however subject give symptom score card . The next morning ( study day 3 ) subject discharge escorted CEMALB final set vital sign , spirometry , symptom scoring , examination study physician . Each volunteer give symptom score sheet day 96 hour ( 4 day ) challenge . Each sheet include name phone number study coordinator study MD . Sample home symptom score sheet instruction include protocol . Between 48 96 hour challenge , volunteer call determine status , inquire symptom , symptom scoring , need medication and/or physician visit . Between 7 10 day challenge dose , subject ask return study discontinuation visit . At time temperature , pulse , systolic diastolic BP , respiratory rate , FVC FEV1 SpO2 ( oxygen saturation ) , symptoms score assess , abnormal , medical evaluation direct study physician undertaken .</detailed_description>

FEV1 least 80 % predict FEV1/FVC ratio least .75 ( without use bronchodilating medication 12 hour ) , consistent lung function person mild episodic mild persistent asthma . History nasal allergy , include episodic , perennial , seasonal sneezing , nasal congestion cough , symptom associate specific exposure ( cat dog ) Criteria classification asthma allergic rhinitis vs. allergic rhinitis alone : History episodic wheezing , chest tightness , shortness breath consistent asthma , physician diagnose asthma . Provocative concentration methacholine produce 20 % fall FEV1 ( PC20 methacholine ) less 10 mg/ml method use ( see ) . Any chronic medical condition consider PI contraindication exposure study include significant cardiovascular disease , diabetes require medication , chronic renal disease , chronic thyroid disease . Physician direct emergency treatment asthma exacerbation within precede 12 month . Use systemic steroid therapy within precede 12 month asthma exacerbation . All use systemic steroid last year review study physician . Use inhaled steroid , cromolyn leukotriene inhibitor ( Montelukast zafirkulast ) initiate within past month ( except use cromolyn exclusively prior exercise ) . Patients must stable regimen therapy show stable . Use daily theophylline within past month . Pregnancy nurse baby . Cigarette smoke &gt; 1 pack per month . Nighttime symptoms cough wheeze great 1x/week baseline ( clearly recognize viral induced asthma exacerbation ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . Exacerbation asthma 2x/week would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . Daily requirement albuterol due asthma symptom ( cough , wheeze , chest tightness ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . ( Not include prophylactic use albuterol prior exercise ) . Dosing level inhale steroid must consistent mild episodic asthma outline NHLBI NAEPP guideline . Any dose inhaled steroid typically use moderate severe asthma result exclusion protocol . Viral upper respiratory tract infection within 2 week challenge . Any acute infection require antibiotic within 2 week challenge .</criteria>
