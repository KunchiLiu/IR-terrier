	<brief_summary>Background : - Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia ( ICL ) condition patient low level T cell , type white blood cell help fight infection . Animal study show experimental drug Interleukin 7 ( IL-7 ) , name CYT107 , increase number function T cell . CYT107 , however , use people ICL . Objectives : - To determine safety CYT107 people ICL . - To determine whether CYT107 increase number function T cell people ICL . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old diagnose ICL risk become sick condition eligible study . In addition , patient must pregnant , illness would cause low CD4 T cell count , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) human T-lymphotrophic virus ( HTLV ) infection . Design : - The initial screening visit include follow examination test : - A complete physical exam medical history - Blood analysis , include CD4 T cell count ; complete blood count additional blood test determine clot ability blood composition ; thyroid , liver , kidney , pancreatic function test ; HIV HTLV test ; test anti-IL-7 antibody block normal IL-7 activity - Routine urine test - Urine blood pregnancy test woman - Chest X-ray - Electrocardiogram - Spleen ultrasound . - The baseline visit include blood test determine level major type antibody , test genetic background , detailed CD4 protein analysis . In addition , leukapheresis ( procedure collect large number immune cell without red blood cell ) do . Participants also option colon lymph node biopsy . - The schedule follow : - Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 ( Cycle 1 ) : Three weekly IL-7 dose visit . - Weeks 5 , 8 , 12 : Follow-up visit . - Weeks 24 , 25 , 26 ( Cycle 2 ) : Three weekly IL-7 dose visit . - Weeks 28 , 31 , 35 : Follow-up visit . - Week 48 : End study visit . - Tests conduct get IL-7 repeat IL-7 cycle follow-up visit compare early value . Optional colon lymph node biopsy do baseline repeat 1 6 week prior Cycle 2 1 6 week prior Week 48 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interleukin-7 ( CYT107 ) Treatment Idiopathic CD4 Lymphocytopenia : Expansion CD4 T Cells ( ICICLE ) Phase I/IIa open-label , single arm clinical trial evaluate safety profile glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 ( rhIL-7 ) immunostimulatory therapy patient idiopathic CD4 T cell lymphocytopenia ( ICL ) risk disease progression . Secondary analysis assess immunostimulatory effect rhIL-7 T cell number function . ICL first characterize early 1990 primary immune disorder CD4 T cell lymphocytopenia ( le 300 cells/microL less 20 % lymphocyte ) , due know infectious process , exogenous medication , autoimmune cytopenia , underlie disorder associate lymphocytopenia . ICL patient risk wide spectrum opportunistic serious infection , autoimmune disorder , type lymphocytopenia . At present , validated treatment exist ICL , treatment direct primarily toward infectious complication arise . A first-generation form rhIL-7 show pre-clinical Phase I study oncology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected patient well tolerate repeat dose trial , long-lasting increase CD4 CD8 T cell . CYT107 second-generation rhIL-7 product make Cytheris via recombinant mammalian cell culture system . DESIGN - Open-label , single-arm , Phase I/IIa interventional clinical trial . Participants evaluate baseline ( prior study treatment ) accord protocol follow-up schedule , receive total 2 cycle rhIL-7 ( CYT107 ) induction phase 8 cycle maintenance phase . Safety assessment rhIL-7 primary focus study visit , secondary analysis immune parameter , include change baseline T cell number function Weeks 24 48 . DURATION - Enrollment expect take 3 4 year . Each volunteer follow least 48 week . Thus , total duration study approximately 5 year . SAMPLE SIZE - Approximately 35-40 patient screen 3-year period achieve desire sample 18 ICL patient , allow primary safety assessment CYT107 Phase I/IIa clinical trial , well explore immunomodulatory effect rhIL-7 . POPULATION - Men woman , age great equal 18 year , confirm diagnosis ICL ( CD4 le 300 cells/micromL less 20 % lymphocyte ) deem risk complication due concurrent CD8 T cell lymphocytopenia and/or history opportunistic otherwise serious infection , without autoimmunity hematologic lymphoid malignancy . REGIMEN - During induction phase , subject receive 2 cycle subcutaneous rhIL-7 dose weekly 3 week dose escalation fashion : 3 microg/kg ( first 3 subjects-completed ) , 10 microg/kg ( next 5 subjects-completed ) 20 microg/kg ( last 5 subject ) , additional 5 subject high achieve dose level . Cycles rhIL-7 administer start Week 1 Week 24 . For subject tolerate induction phase elect participate maintenance phase , additional cycle rhIL-7 may offer 3-6 month interval . These participant receive rhIL-7 high dose least 8 week safety data 5 subject review provide 1 DLT report .</detailed_description>
