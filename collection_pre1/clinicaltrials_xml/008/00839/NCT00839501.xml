	<brief_summary>Andersen-Tawil Syndrome ( ATS ) rare genetic disorder cause episodes muscle weakness , potentially life-threatening change heart rhythm , skeletal developmental abnormality . The cause ATS case remain unknown , specific treatment establish . The purpose study determine whether potassium supplement and/or medication acetazolamide affect duration muscle weakness heart rhythm abnormality people ATS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Potassium Acetazolamide People With Andersen-Tawil Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ATS ion channel disorder cause episodes muscle weakness potentially life-threatening heart arrhythmia . The majority ATS case cause mutation KCNJ2 gene , link potassium channel heart , brain , skeletal muscle ; case presume cause yet undetermined gene lesion . To date , treatment ATS largely anecdotal , treatment formally assess controlled clinical trial . This study determine whether potassium supplement and/or acetazolamide , diuretic medication , affect duration muscle weakness heart rhythm abnormality people ATS . Participation study last 11 month . Participants first attend 3-day inpatient visit include medical history , physical examination , blood work , heart rhythm test electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Holter monitor , strength testing , health questionnaire , daily potassium supplementation . Participants also track number length weakness episode experience hospital . On last day inpatient visit , participant provide multiple bottle contain either potassium placebo . Participants return home 18-week treatment period consist six 3-week-long treatment either potassium placebo , treatment schedule randomly determine . Upon complete first 18-week treatment period , participant attend second 3-day inpatient visit include test procedure first . The difference participant receive acetazolamide along potassium . This follow second 18-week treatment period consist six 3-week-long treatment either acetazolamide placebo . At end second treatment period , participant fill another health questionnaire . Throughout 18-week treatment period , participant phone daily track muscle heart problem . They also provide blood sample weekly basis . At Weeks 2 , 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 17 treatment period , participant wear Holter monitor 24 hour mail . A final outpatient visit occur 8 week end second treatment period include heart rhythm testing , muscle strength testing , blood work .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinically confirm diagnosis AndersenTawil Syndrome , define least two follow three feature : 1 . Neuromuscular Feature Presence clearcut episodes transient muscle weakness without fix deficit typical rest exertion prolong rest , OR An atypical history specific exam finding ( absent reflex normal sensation ictally ) , OR Unexplained intraictal hypokalemia , OR An abnormal nerve conduction exercise test 2 . Cardiac Feature Prolonged QTc interval 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , accord standard criterion , AND/OR Ventricular ectopy , include uniform multifocal PVCs , polymorphic VT , bidirectional VT 3 . Physical Feature ( least two five feature ) Low set ear Hypertelorism Small mandible Clinodactyly Syndactyly Micromelia hand foot OR One three criterion , leat one family member meeting two criterion OR Not meet clinical criterion possess KCNJ2 mutation An average frequency least one neuromuscular symptom ( attack weakness ) per week Sulfa allergy Renal impairment , define serum creatine great 1.5 mg/dl History renal calculus Cardiac disease disease would make potassium supplementation acetazolamide treatment inadvisable Diabetes mellitus Currently take quinidine Pregnant</criteria>
