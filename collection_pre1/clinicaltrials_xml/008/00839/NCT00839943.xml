	<brief_title>Effect Of Obesity On Ozone-Induced Airway Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity show associated initial onset asthma child increase airway hyperresponsiveness adult ( 1,2 ) . An important aspect epidemiologic data impact obesity asthma much strong female male . For example , incidence asthma age 11 year five- sevenfold high female child become obese versus remain lean , whereas relationship exist male ( 3 ) . Recent mouse model obesity suggest condition enhances airway response ozone air pollution ( 4 ) . These mice eat excessively due defect gene encode leptin , satiety hormone produce adipocytes . Shore et al ( 4 ) show leptin-deficient obese mouse great airway hyperreactivity i.v . methacholine follow ozone exposure compare lean , wild-type mouse . Furthermore , administration exogenous leptin ( actually increase serum obese individual ( 4 ) ) show enhance ozone-induced cytokine protein release BAL fluid lean , wild type mouse ( 4 ) . Reduced lung volume alter breathe pattern obese may also contribute enhance airway reactivity patient ( 5 ) . Stretch airway smooth muscle tidal breathe especially deep breath , i.e . sigh , act potent bronchodilator might ameliorate ozone-induced bronchoconstriction . The increased chest load associate obesity may also diminish tidal breathe volume frequency sigh ozone exposure .</detailed_description>
