	<brief_title>A Study Inhalation 20,000 EU CCRE Normal Volunteers Compared Allergic Asthmatic Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , open label study allergic asthmatic normal volunteer . The protocol compare baseline characteristic recover sputum cell ( collected screening day ) cell recover 6 hour inhalational challenge CCRE within group well cross group comparison AA 's NV 's . The following information indicate procedure perform visit well anticipated duration visit . Subsequent description detail regard specific study procedure . Visit 1 : Baseline Visit ( 5 hour ) 1 . Consent obtain , review subject 's medical history , current medication inclusion/exclusion criterion . 2 . Vital sign measurement ( temperature , pulse , respiratory rate , blood pressure ) , oxygen saturation , symptom score 3 . Urine pregnancy test woman child bear potential 4 . Spirometry 5 . Venipuncture CBC differential baseline blood analyse 6 . Physical exam ear , nose , throat chest 7 . Collection exhale breath measurement nitric oxide level 8 . Xenon equilibrium gas scan MCC 9 . MCC scan 10 . Sputum induction 11 . After completion sputum induction , subject brief MCC scan ( &lt; 10 minute ) Visit 2 : 24 hour post baseline subject return follow 1 hour visit : 1. Review change medical status prior 24 hour , vital sign , O2 saturation symptom score 2 . Follow MCC scan Visit 3 : 24-48 hour prior challenge visit least 2 day baseline visit ( ½ hour ) 1. Review change medical status since last visit ; vital sign , oxygen saturation , &amp; symptom score 2 . Urine pregnancy test 3 . Spirometry Visit 4 : Endotoxin ( CCRE ) challenge day ( 8.5 9 hour ) 1. Review change medical status since last visit 2 . Vital sign , oxygen saturation , symptom score 3 . Spirometry 4 . Physical exam ear , nose , throat chest 5 . If measure acceptable , CCRE challenge perform 6 . Post-challenge monitoring include spirometry , vital sign , oxygen saturation , symptom score follow interval post challenge : 30 60 minute hourly 5 additional hour . 7 . Post challenge venipuncture ( blood draw ) CBC differential post CCRE blood analyse 8 . Collection exhale breath measurement nitric oxide level . 9 . Four hour post challenge , subject MCC evaluate 10 . After MCC assess , sputum induction perform . 11 . After completion sputum induction , subject brief MCC scan ( &lt; 10 minute ) 12 . Discharge home , alternatively , GCRC overnight observation per study MD . Visit 5 : 24 hour post challenge visit ( 1 hour ) 1 . Subject return CEMALB , vital sign , oxygen saturation , symptom score 2 . Collection exhale breath measurement nitric oxide level . 3 . Spirometry 4 . Follow-up MCC scan 5 . Each volunteer give symptom score sheet day 96 hour ( 4 day ) challenge ( see accompany symptom score sheet Appendix 3 ) . Post Challenge Observations/Reporting ( 5 minute ) 1 . Subjects contact phone call follow-up 48-96 hour challenge ( see script Appendix 4 accompany protocol ) Study discontinuation visit within 10 day challenge dose : ( 15 minute ) 1 . Vital sign , O2 saturation , symptom score , spirometry 2 . If finding abnormal , medical evaluation direct study physician undertaken Appendix 1 accompany protocol provide summary table regard procedure perform subject study visit</detailed_description>
