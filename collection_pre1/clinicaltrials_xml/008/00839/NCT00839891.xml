	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate How VI-0521 Affect Cardiac Repolarization Healthy Male Female Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This three-arm , parallel group , double-blind , active- placebo-controlled study compare VI-0521 potential therapeutic dose PHEN/TPM 7.5/46 PHEN/TPM 22.5/138 , supra-therapeutic dose , placebo . A single oral dose 400 mg moxifloxacin include positive control term effect cardiac repolarization . The three treatment regimen define follow : Group 1 : 56 subject receive active study drug ( VI-0521 ) steady state , PHEN/TPM 7.5/46 ( potential therapeutic dose ) , escalate PHEN/TPM 22.5/138 ( supra-therapeutic dose ) ; Group 2 : 28 subject receive placebo precede single oral dose moxifloxacin Day 2 ; Group 3 : 28 subject receive placebo follow single oral dose moxifloxacin Day 24 ; A total 112 healthy subject ( approximate 1:1 female : male ratio ) plan randomized.Subjects check clinical research unit ( CRU ) Day -1 . Day 1 baseline electrocardiogram ( ECG ) profile day ( group ) . Active dose Group 1 VI-0521 commence Day 2 . VI-0521 dose escalate every 2-3 day steady-state achieved Day 10 therapeutic dose PHEN/TPM 7.5/46 . A full ECG assessment day perform ( group , blind ) ; enable comparison VI 0521 PHEN/TPM 7.5/46 placebo ( pool Groups 2 3 ) .Subsequently , VI-0521 dose escalated subject Group 1 reach dose 22.5/138 , continue dose level Day 22 . On Day 22 , active group reach steady state supratherapeutic dose level , another ECG assessment day perform ( group , blind ) ; enable comparison supratherapeutic VI-0521 placebo ( pool Groups 2 3 ) . Groups 2 3 receive VI-0521 placebo Days 2 22 .</detailed_description>
