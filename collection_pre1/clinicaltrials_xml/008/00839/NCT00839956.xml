	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate toxicity use vorinostat bortezomib maintenance therapy autologous transplant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate median time disease progression . II . Evaluate survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) day 2 5 vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
