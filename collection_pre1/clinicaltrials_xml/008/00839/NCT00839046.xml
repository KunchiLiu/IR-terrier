	<brief_summary>The burden childhood asthma borne disproportionately child live poverty urban center , many community color great risk environmental exposure . Given complex interaction physical social environmental factor childhood asthma , increase call comprehensive effort use community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) approach . Community Action Against Asthma long standing CBPR partnership Detroit , Michigan , compose representative community-based organization , health human service agency , academia . All member partnership actively involve development CBPR project propose . The specific aim : 1 ) test efficacy air filter ( AFs ) separately combine air conditioner ( ACs ) reduce exposure particulate matter ( PM ) , standard community health worker home visit ( standard ) intervention ; 2 ) test association reduction PM exposure use AFs separately combine ACs standard intervention health outcome child asthma ; 3 ) elucidate causal pathways intervention-related improvement child 's asthma-related health status occur . One hundred fifty household Detroit , Michigan least one child mild persistent moderate severe persistent asthma enrol participate study . Households randomly assign one three group : standard household intervention ( control ) group ; AF intervention group ; AF+AC intervention group . Extensive health exposure measure undertaken course 12 -month intervention . Given role PM child 's asthma-related health high concentration PM microenvironments , need test efficacy efficiency novel approach reduce indoor air pollutant . Doing use CBPR approach enhance relevance ultimately success propose research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Community-based Participatory Research ( CBPR ) Intervention Childhood Asthma Using Air Filters Air Conditioners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For propose study conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare standard community health worker home visit intervention ( standard intervention ) Air Filter ( AF ) intervention add use AF child 's bedroom standard intervention ( AF intervention ) Air Filter ( AF ) + Air Conditioner ( AC ) intervention add use AF AC child 's bedroom standard intervention ( AF+AC intervention ) ( Figure 1 ) . We test whether addition AFs ( , warm month , ACs ) standard intervention , compare standard intervention : ( 1 ) low child 's exposure PM ( Specific Aims 1a , 1b ) , ( 2 ) improve asthma-related health status child ( Aims 2a , 2b ) . One hundred fifty Detroit households least one child age 6 12 symptom consistent persistent asthma ( mild , moderate , severe ) enrol study . Following collection baseline data , household randomly assign receive one three intervention : standard household intervention , AF intervention , AF+AC intervention . Participants assign AF intervention group receive AFs start 12-month intervention ( Summer/Fall 2008 ) . Those assigned AF+AC intervention group receive AFs start intervention period ACs place first summer intervention , instal June 2009 prior second summer intervention ( Figure 2 ) . Data collect across season ( Fall 2008 Winter 2009 ) enable u evaluate directly exposure health outcome effect ( Specific Aims 1a 2a , respectively ) addition AFs alone standard intervention well exposure health outcome effect AFs augment ACs ( Aims 1b , 2b ) . This design also allow comparison , adjust change exposure health status intervention group , combine effect AC AF AF alone .</detailed_description>
