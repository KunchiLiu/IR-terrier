	<brief_summary>The estimate recurrence rate primary spontaneous pneumothorax 23-50 % first episode , optimal treatment remain unknown . In recently publish British Thoracic Society ( BTS ) guideline , simple aspiration recommend first line treatment primary pneumothoraces require intervention . However , 1 year recurrence rate procedure high 25-30 % , make inappropriate standard care . Intrapleural instillation chemical irritant ( chemical pleurodesis ) effective way shorten duration air leak reduce rate recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax surgical non-surgical patient . Many chemical irritant ( tetracycline , talc , minocycline ) use decrease rate recurrence spontaneous pneumothorax . Tetracycline , commonly use irritant , longer available . Talc insufflation pleural cavity safe effective primary spontaneous pneumothorax . However , apply either surgical medical thoracoscopy . Minocycline , derivative tetracycline , effective tetracycline induce pleural fibrosis rabbit . In previous study , show additional minocycline pleurodesis safe convenient procedure decrease rate ipsilateral recurrence thoracoscopic treatment primary spontaneous pneumothorax . In present study , additional minocycline pleurodesis randomly administer patient first episode primary spontaneous pneumothorax simple aspiration . The primary goal test intrapleural minocycline reduce rate recurrence . The secondary goal evaluate safety profile , short-term result , long-term effect minocycline pleurodesis simple aspiration . The site study include National Taiwan University Hospital Far Eastern Memorial Hospital . A total 300 patient ( 150 patient arm ) include study .</brief_summary>
