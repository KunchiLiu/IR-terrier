	<brief_summary>Advances critical care medicine dramatically improve survival critically ill patient require prolonged mechanical ventilation . However , systematic follow-up , rehabilitation , psychoeducational intervention vulnerable patient family caregiver contribute survivor recovery rehabilitation . Major barrier develop program survivor prolong mechanical ventilation caregiver include follow : 1 . There inadequate information determinant long-term functional outcome diverse group survivor prolong mechanical ventilation . 2 . There inadequate information need survivor prolong mechanical ventilation family caregiver across trajectory illness ( i.e. , ICU community ) . 3 . There poor understanding development ICU-acquired muscle injury . Towards RECOVER first study identify survivor prolong mechanical ventilation at-risk poor functional outcome , identify element care-giving situation put caregiver risk poor quality life mental health , catalogue rehabilitative need patient family caregiver across illness trajectory , evaluate mechanism critical illness associate muscle injury . The RECOVER Program consist Four Phases : - Phase I : Towards RECOVER - Phase II : RECOVER development pilot test - Phase III : RECOVER randomize control trial - Phase IV : Long-term implementation RECOVER</brief_summary>
