	<brief_title>Studying Cells Collected Through Ductal Lavage Women Undergoing Surgery Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Other Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine expression pattern program cell death ( PCD ) regulatory gene bcl-2 , bax , bcl-xL primary ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) culture . - Determine whether down-regulation genetic manipulation anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 and/or bcl-xL , alone conjunction physiological preventive dos tamoxifen citrate , high induction PCD primary DCIS cell culture . - Determine expression pattern PCD regulatory gene bcl-2 , bax , bcl-xL cell obtain breast ductal lavage . - Determine whether down-regulation genetic manipulation anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 and/or bcl-xL , alone conjunction physiological preventive dos tamoxifen citrate , high induction PCD cell obtain breast ductal lavage . OUTLINE : Patients undergo breast lavage collect primary epithelial cell cytological analysis plan surgical procedure . Ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) tissue sample obtain surgery use establish primary DCIS cell culture . The DCIS cell primary epithelial cell obtain ductal lavage analyze endogenous protein level bcl-2 , bax , bcl-xL , use western blot immunohistochemical staining , determine appropriate antisense oligonucleotide molecule use induce apoptosis . The DCIS cell primary epithelial cell obtain ductal lavage treat antisense oligonucleotides and/or physiological chemopreventive dose tamoxifen citrate determine provide high induction cell death . The effect treatment protein expression analyze western blot immunohistochemistry . The effect treatments marker program cell death ( PCD ) ( i.e. , DNA fragmentation caspase activation ) also analyze . Changes mRNA expression analyze use PCR-based quantitation assay . Results molecular marker assay provide patient .</detailed_description>
