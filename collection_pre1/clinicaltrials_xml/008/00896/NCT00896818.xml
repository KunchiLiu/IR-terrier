	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To identify new breast cancer susceptibility alleles breast cancer patient family control . - To compare prevalence know polymorphisms gene involve hormonal activation degradation pathway breast cancer patient family control . - To correlate polymorphism quantitative intermediate marker susceptibility breast cancer , circulate hormone level mammographic density . - To perform linkage analysis detect new susceptibility gene large multiple-case family combine data family previously collect Institute Cancer Research . - To evaluate relationship polymorphism hormone level relatives family control . - To compare average hormone level patient ' unaffected first-degree relative family control use urine sample premenopausal woman urine and/or serum sample postmenopausal woman . - To perform follow-up cohort unaffected first-degree relative moderate-to-high risk develop breast cancer prospective questionnaire data hormone measurement . OUTLINE : Unaffected affect first-degree female relative family friend control undergo blood sample collection study . Genomic DNA purify blood sample genetic analysis . Within cohort unaffected first-degree relative , postmenopausal woman also provide single urine sample hormonal assay . Hormones analyze serum and/or urine postmenopausal woman include estradiol , estrone , sulphate , prolactin , androstenedione , testosterone , progesterone , 17-hydroxyprogesterone , SHBG . Unaffected premenopausal woman within cohort provide urine sample 6 successive day around midpoint menstrual cycle one day towards luteal phase menstrual cycle . These sample analyze luteinizing hormone metabolite estradiol progesterone ( i.e. , creatinine ratio estrone glucuronide pregnanediol glucuronide ) . Access case note , mammogram , archival tumor block accompany pathology report breast cancer patient affect relative request . When tumor sample tumor bilateral case available , sample analyze identify region loss heterozygosity tumor lose chromosomal region . Cancer patient control , include affect unaffected first-degree relative , relative marriage , friends complete questionnaire baseline provide information demographic ( i.e. , personal family ) , cancer diagnosis treatment ( applicable ) , know risk factor breast cancer ( i.e. , lifestyle , reproductive behavior , family history ) . Study participant may follow periodically cancer incidence cause-specific mortality . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK .</detailed_description>
