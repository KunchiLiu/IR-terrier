	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine polymorphism result great activation cyclophosphamide ( CYP2B6 , CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 ) associate disease-free survival treatment toxicity woman breast cancer . - Determine polymorphism result less production quinone-related oxidative damage doxorubicin hydrochloride ( NQO1 , NQO2 , NOS2 , NOS3 , CBR3 ) associate disease-free survival treatment toxicity patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Tissue sample archive clinical trial SWOG-8897 genotyped polymorphism CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 , CYP2B6 , NQO1 , NQO2 , NOS2 , NOS3 , CBR3 gene matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry . Variant allele correlate patient outcome . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,577 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
