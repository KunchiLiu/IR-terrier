	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study whether give combination docetaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil chemotherapy follow combination cisplatin radiation therapy work treat patient advanced nasopharyngeal cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Giving combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Sequential Concurrent Chemoradiation Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma ( NPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To establish progression free survival rate 2 year , use RECIST criterion , induction treatment docetaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil ( TPF ) follow chemoradiotherapy locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . To evaluate complete response rate , safety feasibility TPF follow chemoradiation patient NPC OUTLINE : This single site study . INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive docetaxel IV 60 minute day 1 ; cisplatin IV 1-3 hour ( carboplatin IV 30 minute ) day 1 ; fluorouracil IV continuously 24 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CONCURRENT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY : Beginning within 3-6 week initiate last course induction chemotherapy , patient undergo 3-dimensional conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy daily 6.5-7 week . Patients also receive cisplatin IV 1 hour ( carboplatin IV 30 minute ) weekly week 1-6 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
