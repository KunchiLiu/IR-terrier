	<brief_summary>This open , randomized study patient different severity stage hepatic cirrhosis , rater pair use assessment intra- inter-rater reproducibility NRL972 pharmacokinetics CTP sum score . Rating perform 32 40 pair raters . The raters perform require assessment capacity sub-investigators phase I ( coordinate ) unit . Up 240 patient clinically establish hepatic cirrhosis without confound end-stage co-morbidity ( stable disease ) study . Within 30 day confirmation eligibility , Visit 1 take place determine investigational parameter ( NRL972 pharmacokinetics , clinical laboratory test , determination CTP sum score ) . At approximate interval one week , Visits 2 , 3 4 occur , investigational parameter assess .</brief_summary>
