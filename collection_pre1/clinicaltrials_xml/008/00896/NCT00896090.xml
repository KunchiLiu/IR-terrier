	<brief_title>Cortical Excitability Inhibition Children Adolescents With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether single paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) use detect brain change child adolescent major depressive disorder . Transcranial magnetic stimulation noninvasive focal brain stimulation technology make certain part brain work without put wire chemical body . Single paired-pulse TMS involve give one two brief magnetic pulse brain often every second measure subject 's thumb movement . This different call repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) investigator rapidly give many pulse brain idea alter brain function treat illness . This study involve treatment . It study examine brain change associate depression child adolescent . The technique use study ( single paired-pulse TMS ) much safe rTMS use safely frequently ( 2,000 publish case ) research child . Investigators study use TMS measure cortical excitability ( active brain ) cortical inhibition ( active brain well chemical slow brain function work ) child adolescent MDD healthy control . The aim study compare measure cortical excitability inhibition two group ( depressed child adolescent normal control ) , determine relationship measure cortical inhibition excitability severe symptom depression subject measure change differently age depress child adolescent normal control . The investigator hypothesize subject depression decrease cortical inhibition compare healthy control depressed subject great difference cortical inhibition leave right side brain healthy control . The investigator also hypothesize subject severe symptom depression lower cortical inhibition . Also hypothesize , depressed subject , cortical inhibition increase age significantly healthy control .</detailed_description>
