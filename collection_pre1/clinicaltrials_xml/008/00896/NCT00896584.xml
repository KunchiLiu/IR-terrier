	<brief_summary>Some patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) need supplementary oxygen air travel . Guidelines issue The British Thoracic Society ( BTS ) pre-flight evaluation discriminate sufficiently need supplementary oxygen flight , without . Previous study indicate decrease hemoglobin oxygen saturation exercise may predict in-flight hypoxemia . The objective present study examine add exercise oxygen desaturation BTS algorithm good predict requirement in-flight supplementary oxygen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The British Thoracic Society ( BTS ) guideline pre-flight evaluation patient chronic respiratory disease base algorithm arterial oxygen saturation discriminate factor . It recently show algorithm discriminate sufficiently patient need pre-flight evaluation maybe supplementary oxygen air travel , travel air without supplemental oxygen evaluation . Studies also show exercise desaturation may predict in-flight hypoxemia . The objective present study examine inclusion arterial oxygen saturation measure pulseoximetry exercise BTS algorithm , increase sensitivity specificity BTS pre-flight evaluation guidelines.The study also include questionnaire symptom air travel carry ande pre-flight evaluation .</detailed_description>
