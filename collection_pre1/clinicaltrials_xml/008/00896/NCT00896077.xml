	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) autoimmune disease . Autoimmune diseases happen immune system identify part body belonging . The immune system destroy part unknown tissue body . In T1DM , body kill cell pancreas produce insulin . Insulin hormone `` unlocks '' cell body . It allow glucose enter fuel . Special cell body call islet make insulin . Since glucose enter cell , build blood . The body 's cell literally starve death . Children risk develop T1DM risk much high severe , chronic childhood disease . The treatment careful diet , planned physical activity , test blood sugar level several time day . The patient must also inject insulin day use insulin pump . There cure T1DM . Insulin injection consider life support , go without insulin day cause blood much acid lead death . On hand , take much insulin make blood sugar level go low , untreated , lead death well . DiaKine develop Lisofylline treat fail immune system . This cause T1DM first place go away . The purpose study see safe study drug . The study also go compare level study drug blood measure effect study drug substance blood link type 1 diabetes . These level measure study drug give injection skin injection vein . To date , Lisofylline test give injection vein . The investigator hypothesize Lisofylline safe give injection skin vein level study drug similar give injection skin vein . The investigator also hypothesize Lisofylline positive effect substance blood link type 1 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Compound : Lisofylline Protocol Number Title : DT-002 : A Safety , Tolerability Bioavailability Study Lisofylline After Continuous Subcutaneous ( 12 mg/kg ) Intravenous ( 12 mg/kg ) Administration Healthy Subjects Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Clinical Trial Phase : Phase 1 / Phase 2A Study Objectives : The primary objective study assess safety tolerability Lisofylline ( LSF ) healthy adult subject adult subject type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) follow single dose LSF 12 mg/kg administer continuous subcutaneous ( s.c. ) infusion 24 hour , versus single dose LSF 12 mg/kg administer continuous intravenous ( i.v . ) infusion 24 hour . The secondary objective study ( 1 ) determine bioavailability single dose LSF 12 mg/kg administer continuous s.c. infusion 24 hour compare single dose LSF 12 mg/kg administer continuous i.v . infusion 24 hour ; ( 2 ) exploratory evaluation early efficacy LSF base upon evaluation pharmacodynamic ( PD ) data . Principal Investigator Study Site : Benno G. Roesch , MD Advanced Biomedical Research , Inc. Clinical Research Center 241 Main Street Hackensack , New Jersey 07601 USA Number Subjects Subject Population : Up 8 male female subject ( 4 healthy adult male female subject 4 male female subject type 1 DM ) enrol two separate cohort study ensure total least 6 evaluable subject . Healthy male female subject 18-45 year age , inclusive , male female subject , 18-45 year age , inclusive , clinical diagnosis type 1 DM minimum 2 year , require treatment insulin , clinically significant exclusionary disease condition , eligible participate study . Study Design : This open-label , single-dose , randomize , two-period , two-treatment , crossover study healthy subject subject type 1 DM . Eligible subject admit Clinic even prior dose ( Day -1 , Day 6 ) treatment period , receive assign dose study drug Day 1 Day 7 , remain confined Clinic approximately 48 h follow start study drug administration ( Day 3 , Day 9 ) . A washout period three day separate two treatment period . All subject receive single dose LSF 12 mg/kg administer via continuous i.v . infusion 24-hour period one treatment period single dose LSF 12 mg/kg administer via continuous s.c. infusion 24-hour period alternate treatment period . Healthy subject subject type 1 DM comprise two separate cohort . All subject assign treatment sequence accord randomization schedule balance sequence assignment within two cohort . Study Duration : The overall duration study subject approximately 30 day . This include 21-day screening period , two active treatment period three day separate 3-day washout period . Study Drug : The drug product , LSF injection , supply Sponsor designee 120 mg/mL sterile solution ( 600 mg LSF/5 mL ) USP type 1 mold clear glass vial . Each subject receive single dose LSF 12 mg/kg continuous s.c. infusion 24 hour one period , single dose LSF 12 mg/kg continuous i.v . infusion 24 hour alternate period randomize fashion . Treatment Groups : There two treatment group : LSF 12 mg/kg continuous s.c. infusion 24 hour LSF 12 mg/kg continuous i.v . infusion 24 hour . Study Procedures : After provide write informed consent , subject undergo complete medical history , medication history , physical examination , vital sign evaluation , rest 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , clinical laboratory test [ chemistry , hematology , urinalysis , HIV , Hepatitis B &amp; C diagnostic profile urine drug , alcohol pregnancy ( female ) screen , ] within 21 day prior receive first dose study drug . On Days 1 7 , eligible subject receive single dose LSF 12 mg/kg administer via continuous i.v . infusion 24-hour period one treatment period single dose LSF 12 mg/kg administer via continuous s.c. infusion 24-hour period alternate treatment period . Seated blood pressure pulse rate measure Days 1-3 7-9 within 15 min prior start infusion 1 , 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 h follow start infusion . A rest 12-lead ECG perform Days 1-2 Days 7-8 1 , 8 24 h follow start infusion , prior discharge Clinic Day 9 . An abbreviated physical examination perform Day 3 , prior discharge Clinic complete physical examination perform Day 9 , prior discharge study . Adverse event ( AEs ) monitor nurse medical observation spontaneous report throughout study . In addition , skin irritation assessment perform Days 1-2 Days 7-8 within 15 min prior start infusion 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 24 h follow start infusion . Blood collect determination plasma LSF concentration Days 1-2 Days 7-8 within 0.5 h prior start infusion ( time 0 ) 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 18 24 h follow start infusion . On Day 2 Day 8 , blood sample collect 5 , 10 , 15 30 min 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 16 h follow completion 24-h infusion period . Blood collect evaluation cytokine , chemokine , insulin free fatty acid ( FFA ) serum level , evaluation STAT4 phosphorylation status monocyte , Days 1-2 Days 7-8 within 0.5 h prior start infusion ( time 0 ) 24 h follow start infusion . Study Endpoints Plasma LSF concentration PK assessment : Blood collect determination plasma LSF concentration time point note previously . PK parameter include AUC0-t , AUC0-inf , Cmax , Tmax , t1/2 , kel , CL , Vdss F. PD assessment : Blood collect determination serum cytokine , chemokine , insulin FFA level time point note previously . Safety outcome measure : Safety base AEs , vital sign assessment , rest 12-lead ECG evaluation , physical examination finding clinical laboratory test result .</detailed_description>
