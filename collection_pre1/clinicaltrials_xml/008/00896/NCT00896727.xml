	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying protein express tumor tissue sample laboratory patient cancer may help doctor learn biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This laboratory study look protein expression predict response treatment use tumor tissue sample woman stage I , stage II , stage IIIA breast cancer treat clinical trial SWOG-9313 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9313A Protein Expression Predicting Response Treatment Using Tumor Tissue Samples From Women With Stage I , Stage II , Stage IIIA Breast Cancer Treated Clinical Trial SWOG-9313</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess in-situ protein expression estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , HER-2 , p53 automate quantitative analysis ( AQUA™ ) multiplexed analysis 2 marker per slide use tumor tissue woman stage I , stage II , stage IIIA breast cancer treat clinical trial SWOG-9313 . - Assess main effect ER , PR , HER-2 , p53 , well interaction generate class form cluster biomarkers , large breast cancer tissue microarray predict disease-free overall survival patient receive high-dose cyclophosphamide doxorubicin hydrochloride clinical trial SWOG-9313 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord receptor status menopausal status . Tumor tissue sample analyze quantitative protein expression analysis ( AQUA™ , fluorescent antibody technique ) estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , p53 HER-2 . AQUA™ use assess marker individually ratios use cluster algorithms define reproducible classification tissue patient treat SWOG-9313 function molecular classification . Results AQUA™ test compare immunohistochemistry fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) result obtain SWOG-9313 .</detailed_description>
