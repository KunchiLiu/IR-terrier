	<brief_title>Studying Different Formulations SR13668 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine oral formulation Akt inhibitor SR13668 provide best bioavailability normal , healthy volunteer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine oral pharmacokinetics single , low dose Akt inhibitor SR13668 healthy volunteer . II . Characterize metabolism Akt inhibitor SR13668 healthy volunteer . III . Collect preliminary safety data Akt inhibitor SR13668 healthy volunteer . OUTLINE : STAGE 1 ( first 6 participant enrol study [ close accrual August , 2009 ] ) : Participants randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Participants complete overnight fast ≥ 10 hour , eat high-fat ( approximately 50 % total caloric content meal ) high-calorie ( approximately 800-1,000 calorie ) , receive single dose oral SR13668 PEG400/Labrasol® liquid formulation 8 ounce water . Participants may eat ≥ 4 hour study drug administration . ARM II : Participants complete overnight fast ≥ 10 hour receive single dose oral SR13668 PEG400/Labrasol® liquid formulation 8 ounce water . Participants may eat ≥ 4 hour study drug administration . STAGE 2 ( next 12 participant enrol study ) : The preferred dietary condition ( Arm I ) identify stage 1 use . Participants randomize 1 4 arm . ARM III : Participants receive single dose oral Akt inhibitor SR13668 Solutol® self-emulsifying solid dispersion capsule formulation . ARM IV : Participants receive single dose oral Akt inhibitor SR13668 Solutol®/vitamin E TGPS self-emulsifying solid dispersion capsule formulation . ARM V : Participants receive single dose oral Akt inhibitor SR13668 vitamin E TGPS self-emulsifying solid dispersion capsule formulation . ARM VI : Participants receive single dose oral Akt inhibitor SR13668 Myrj 53 self-emulsifying solid dispersion capsule formulation . Blood urine sample collect baseline periodically 24 hour study drug administration pharmacokinetic analysis high performance liquid chromatography assay . After completion study treatment , participant follow telephone 7-10 day 30 day .</detailed_description>
