	<brief_title>Study Breast Tissue Women Not Previously Diagnosed With Breast Cancer Who Are Undergoing Fine Needle Aspiration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine breast tissue DNA methylation profile hormone concentration change across follicular luteal phase , across menopause , random fine needle aspiration sample woman prior diagnosis treatment breast cancer . - To determine DNA methylation profile breast hormone level correlate mammographic density , cytomorphology , Gail risk estimate . - To develop high throughput commercial assay DNA methylation profile assess breast cancer risk . - To develop highly sensitive , specific , novel nanoassay estradiol progesterone . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Premenopausal woman stratify menstrual cycle phase ( mid-follicular [ day 5-10 ] v mid-luteal [ day 20-25 ] ) , base adjust 28-day cycle . Patients undergo breast density measurement digital mammography . Blood sample obtain analyzed estradiol , progesterone , follicle-stimulating hormone measurement , define menstrual/menopausal status , DNA extraction . Patients also undergo random fine needle aspiration . Biopsy material aspiration analyze cytomorphology , steroid radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) , steroid nanoassay , DNA methylation study ( via polymerase chain reaction ) . The aspiration sample also analyze estradiol progesterone level use high-pressure liquid chromatography RIA .</detailed_description>
