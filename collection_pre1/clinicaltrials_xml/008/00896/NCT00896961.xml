	<brief_title>EF5 Evaluate Tumor Hypoxia Patients With High-Grade Soft Tissue Sarcoma Mouth Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine biologically-relevant hypoxia image cellular analysis EF5 binding patient high-grade soft tissue sarcoma trunk extremity squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity . II . Determine spatial relationship EF5 bind various tumor tissue marker , pathological process , serum plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 patient . III . Correlate EF5 bind Eppendorf electrode measurement patient-related factor patient . IV . Determine adjust unadjusted association clinical outcome optimal measure EF5 binding , patient/tumor characteristic , biological marker patient . OUTLINE : Approximately 24-48 hour prior surgical resection biopsy , patient receive EF5 IV 2Â½ hour . Tissue sample analyze immunohistochemistry EF5 binding . Blood sample analyze genetic marker cytokine associate hypoxia EF5 concentration .</detailed_description>
