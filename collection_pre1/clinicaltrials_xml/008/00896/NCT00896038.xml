	<brief_summary>Objective : Alcoholism highly co-morbid post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Since stress negative affective state major relapse trigger factor alcohol use , negative symptom associate PTSD think promote alcohol dependence . Substance P , release amygdala response stress , act NK1 receptor ( NK1Rs ) mediate behavioral stress response . Blockade NK1R represent novel approach anti-stress action . In recent double blind , placebo control study involve detoxify anxious alcoholic , find NK1R antagonism decrease alcohol craving , attenuate cortisol response stress , significantly decrease insula activation response negative sensory input . The present study intend expand finding determine whether NK1R candidate target treat alcohol dependent patient PTSD . Study Population : On hundred twenty participant PTSD co-morbid alcohol dependence recruit stratified PTSD etiology ( 60 participant civilian combat PTSD , resp ) . Within stratum , treatment group balance sex use urn randomization . Stratification indicate since civilian combat-related PTSD theoretically different pathophysiology . Civilians typically experience single trauma exposure invariably high magnitude , result symptom immediately . Combat-related PTSD typically result multiple traumatic exposure prolong period time , variable magnitude , frequently delay emergence symptom . Design : Participants admit National Institute Alcohol Abuse Alcoholism ( NIAAA ) research inpatient unit NIH Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) protocol number 05-AA-0121 assessment treatment people alcohol drink problem , provide diagnostic assessment standard withdrawal treatment need . Participants enter present protocol treatment , need complete . Following inclusion , participant receive 1 week single blind placebo , randomize double blind treatment aprepitant placebo . Randomized treatment 3 week . Spontaneous craving alcohol , rating psychopathology obtain twice weekly inpatient unit throughout study . Cravings well endocrine immune response also assess challenge session combine social stressor exposure physical alcohol cue . During final week , three session utilize script carry , separate day counter-balanced order , expose participant personalize trauma , alcohol-associated neutral stimulus . Cravings well endocrine immune response also assess script presentation . A functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) session carry last assess response affective stimulus . Participants remain hospitalized throughout study , remain unit three day post-medication monitoring period . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome crave alcohol change PTSD symptom result script session . Secondary outcome include craving change PTSD symptom result combined social stress-alcohol cure challenge session , spontaneous crave PTSD symptom hospitalization , brain response fMRI session .
