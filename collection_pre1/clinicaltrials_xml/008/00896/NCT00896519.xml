	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Colony-stimulating factor , GM-CSF , may cause body make blood cell help recover side effect rituximab combination chemotherapy . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give GM-CSF together rituximab combination chemotherapy work treat patient previously untreated advanced follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate overall objective tumor response rate ( complete partial response rate ) patient previously untreated advanced follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma treat sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) R-CHOP . Secondary - To evaluate time progression . - To evaluate overall survival . - To evaluate duration response . - To evaluate time next treatment . - To evaluate safety profile GM-CSF combination R-CHOP . - To evaluate influence FcγR polymorphisms clinical response . - To monitor FcγR express cell peripheral blood treatment . - To monitor molecular biological marker bcl-2 [ ( 14 ; 18 ) ] peripheral blood bone marrow quantitative PCR assay . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive R-CHOP comprise rituximab IV , cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine sulfate IV day 1 oral prednisone day 1-5 . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 2-6 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 GM-CSF SC day 1-5 . Treatment rituximab GM-CSF repeat every 21 day 2 course . Patients achieve complete partial response proceed maintenance therapy . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 GM-CSF SC day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 2 month 12 course . Blood bone marrow sample collect baseline periodically study analysis FcγR expression immunophenotyping bcl-2 rearrangement quantitative PCR . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
