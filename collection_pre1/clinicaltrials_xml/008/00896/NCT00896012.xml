	<brief_summary>Current therapy prevent organ rejection relies use calcineurin inhibitor either cyclosporine tacrolimus . Although agent successful prevent early acute rejection , success translate improved long-term kidney transplant function . One important factor lead premature kidney transplant failure chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) . CAN characterize progressive interstitial fibrosis `` scarring '' , vascular wall thickening , finally glomerular sclerosis lead slow progressive loss kidney function . Calcineurin inhibitor show play important role pathogen CAN . Renal transplant recipient calcineurin inhibitor discontinue enjoy well long kidney function . Therefore , immunosuppressive strategy design intention withdraw calcineurin inhibitor . The purpose trial test tacrolimus safely substitute sirolimus ( Rapamycin ) substitution yield improve renal function , less CAN well graft survival rate first year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine tacrolimus safely lower potentially non-nephrotoxic level discontinue completely favor Rapamycin 3 month kidney transplantation . In study , patient maintain full-dose ( 720 mg BID ) mycophenolate sodium ( Myfortic ) ensure adequate immunosuppression . In addition , compare immunosuppressive regimen Rapamune/mycophenolate sodium/Prednisone Low-Dose Prograf/ mycophenolate sodium /Prednisone long-term effect renal function , cardiovascular risk factor , subclinical rejection chronic allograft fibrosis . We also plan examine clinical benefit protocol biopsy . The first protocol biopsy would occur time implantation . This would provide assessment state donor kidney . The severity donor disease would provide baseline subsequent biopsy compare . The second protocol biopsy would perform time tacrolimus withdrawal . Patients find subclinical rejection biopsy would undergo tacrolimus withdrawal may benefit increased immunosuppression . The protocol biopsy would provide additional level safety ensure `` low-risk '' ( histologically ) patient undergo tacrolimus withdrawal . A third biopsy would perform one year transplantation . Renal allograft tissue would examine presence progressive fibrosis persistent subclinical rejection lead graft failure . The efficacy tacrolimus withdrawal assess use clinical pathologic criterion . A third aim trial examine whether change immunosuppressive therapy lead differential expression immunological marker serum mediator cytokine . Recent study suggest , vitro , thymoglobulin induces generation `` regulatory '' cell . This study examine vivo relevance novel observation . In addition , measure circulatory mediator renal fibrosis examine two treatment arm differ effect cytokine/growth factor . Blood sample collect PBMC analyze FACS composition presence cell surface antigen may reflect state immunological regulation `` suppression '' . Tissue sample analyze immunohistochemistry presence immunologically relevant cellular subtypes CD4/CD25 regulatory T cell . Serum sample collect analyzed cytokine growth factor expression .</detailed_description>
