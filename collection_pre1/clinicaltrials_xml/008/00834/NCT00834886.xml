	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Treatment Effects Melatonin Light Therapy Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delayed sleep phase syndrome ( DSPS ) circadian rhythm sleep disorder sleep-wake rhythm significantly delay accord environmental demand . Hence , symptom consist major difficulty fall asleep problem awaken due time patient often experience work- school relate impairment ( The International Classification Sleep Disorders : Diagnostic Coding manual , 2005 ) . However , correct diagnosis often make treatment offer , accordingly , often inadequate . DSPS normally develop interplay dysfunctional habits/behaviour biological vulnerability . Bright light therapy administration exogenous melatonin comprise common intervention . Timed bright light show effectively phase advance rhythm ( Rosenthal et al. , 1990 ) , standardize guideline regard duration , intensity timing light exposure establish . Compliance treatment often poor involves structure daily schedule , may hard relevant age group . Similarly , administration melatonin even show phase advance rhythm ( Lewy et al. , 1998 ; Mundey , Benloucif , Harsanyi , Dubocovich , &amp; Zee , 2005 ) , standardized approach dose , duration timing lacking . It important establish effective treatment guideline delay sleep phase syndrome . Large scale study effect melatonin bright light treatment randomize placebo-controlled design need . In clinical trial aim investigate efficacy bright light melatonin treatment use 4 armed randomize placebo control design .</detailed_description>
