	<brief_title>Adjunctive Atropine During Ketamine Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The degree secretion significantly less atropine group compare control group end procedure ( VAS score : 16.5 ± 9.9 vs. 27.0 ± 15.9 , atropine vs. control , p = 0.00 ) . The change degree secretion start end procedure significantly great atropine group control group ( p = 0.00 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . However , frequency hypersalivation predefined ( VAS score ≥50 ) differ group ( p = 0.06 ) . The complication differ significantly two group tachycardia ( p &gt; 0.05 ) . Complications aspiration , laryngospasm , apnea document hospital . There few intervention hypersalivation atropine group , difference significant ( p &gt; 0.05 ) . As intervention , O2 administration endotracheal intubation need . After discharge , control patient tend complaint nausea , vomit , ataxia , although difference significant ( p &gt; 0.05 ) Heart rate increase significantly atropine group ( p = 0.00 ) . The frequency tachycardia accord patient age also significantly high atropine group control group ( p = 0.00 )</detailed_description>
