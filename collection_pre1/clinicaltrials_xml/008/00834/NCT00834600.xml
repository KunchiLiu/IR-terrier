	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : That antihypertensive drug selection guide activity renin angiotensin system superior strategy advocate JNC 7 achieve blood pressure control monotherapy . Background : National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute , Joint National Committee Detection , Treatment Control Hypertension ( JNC 7 ) recommend hypertensive patient begin therapy diuretic sequentially add class drug blood pressure control . This approach appear assume homogeneity mechanism BP control different patient . When standardized strategy rigidly apply Clinical Trials , majority patient generally require 2 agent achieve blood pressure control . The pioneering work Laragh , Sealey colleague , widely confirm others , suggest instead heterogeneity , fact , characterize pattern blood pressure control population . This heterogeneity expose assessment activity renin angiotensin system ( RAS ) . Specifically , volume vasoconstriction determine blood pressure control . Patients volume predominates suppress RAS , , conversely , vasoconstriction predominates activate RAS . This simply accurately determine estimation plasma renin activity ( PRA ) . It demonstrate volume vasoconstriction dependent hypertensive patient respond best different drug . By exploitation RAS possible provide rational therapy patient accord mechanism blood pressure control . The result appropriate therapy effective efficient . A specific system Laragh Method design translate physiologically base paradigm practical scheme patient management . The purpose trial determine whether Laragh Method lead well efficient blood pressure control general population hypertensive patient exist treatment strategy . The measure hypothesis test percentage hypertensive patient achieve blood pressure control monotherapy . The significance trial enormous individual society . Some 50 million Americans hypertension 25 million currently treatment . If Laragh Method lead parsimonious effective care , mean literally million individual patient spar burden unnecessary polypharmacy . Moreover , strain health care cost associate antihypertensive therapy redu</detailed_description>
