	<brief_summary>Barbed suture offer several potential advantage layer wound closure hip knee replacement surgery . It use gain increased acceptance across many surgical discipline time . The purpose study evaluate use Quill part layer closure compare use traditional suture . The study timeline begin time surgical procedure continue routine follow-up total joint replacement 2 , 6 , 12 week , conclude six month post-operative office visit . Primary Objectives : - To evaluate safety efficacy wound closure primary hip knee replacement use bidirectional barbed suture ( knotless ) compare traditional layer ( vicryl ) wound closure . Secondary Objectives : - Establish around ( intra-operative post-operative ) cost-savings potential use knotless wound closure compare layer vicryl closure ( standard suture protocol ) . - Assess overall cosmesis wound/scar well perceive presence subcutaneous surgical knot , use knotless wound closure versus traditional layered suture closure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Knotless Suture Closure Total Hip Knee Arthroplasties</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We perform prospective , randomized clinical trial evaluate efficacy use bidirectional barbed suture compare traditional suture deep closure primary total hip ( 25 ) knee ( 35 ) arthroplasty . Complications , time closure , length surgery evaluate . Closure note significantly faster ( 9.3 v 13.6 minute , P b .005 ) barb suture group . Wound-related complication similar ( 3 case ) group 3-month follow-up . Although study support use barbed technology functionally comparable efficient modality wound closure potential cost saving base reduced operative time , cost-effectiveness adoption institution dependent rely optimization perioperative factor .</detailed_description>
