	<brief_title>A Safety Study Eptifibatide Patients With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease refer condition associate increase risk blood clot increase inflammation . Despite abundant laboratory evidence abnormal blood clot inflammation , contribution change problem experience patient sickle cell disease remain uncertain . In additional abnormal blood clotting , platelet ( small blood cell help blood clot ) activate sickle cell disease patient compare healthy patient without disease . In addition , sickle cell disease patient experience painful crisis , evidence platelet activation abnormal blood clot increase even . Activated platelet release substance call cluster designation 40 ligand , increase sticky line blood vessel increase abnormal blood clotting . The level cluster designation 40 ligand much high sickle cell disease patient compare healthy individual without disease . In addition , level increase even sickle cell patient experience painful crisis . Painful crisis represent common clinical problem sickle cell disease , largely responsible make lives patient unpredictable . However , treatment painful crisis remain inadequate , consist mainly strong pain medication . In study , evaluate safety eptifibatide sickle cell patient well work course painful crisis . At completion trial , improve understanding contribution platelet activation inflammation problem sickle cell disease . The overall hypothesis seek test increase platelet activation resultant inflammatory response important contributor problem sickle cell disease . We believe decrease platelet stickiness , release mediator inflammation abnormal blood clotting , eptifibatide affect clinical course complication disease . If result study support hypothesis eptifibatide safe effective population , plan carry large study definitively evaluate safety eptifibatide well work treatment and/or prevention painful crisis sickle cell disease .</detailed_description>
