	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To evaluate safety activate T cell infusion immunization hTERT multi-peptide vaccine post-transplant set whether combination delay hematopoietic recovery induce autoimmune event . 2 . To determine whether strategy infuse vaccine-primed T-cells early transplant conjunction post-transplant booster lead induction cellular immune response hTERT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Clinical Trial Combining hTERT Tumor Vaccine &amp; Autologous T Cells Patients With Advanced Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol propose combine two different investigational product test hypothesis autologous T cell therapy augment potency putative tumor vaccine post- stem cell transplant , lead myeloma-directed T-cell mediate `` graft vs. myeloma '' effect patient advance myeloma . The hope combination therapy approach result rapid recovery acquire immunity consequently increased cure rate well clinical outcome . The two investigational product evaluate Phase I/II study include : 1. hTERT Vaccine ( putative tumor vaccine ) - multi-peptide vaccine consist 3 peptide catalytic subunit telomerase ( hTERT D988Y , I540 , R572Y ) , 1 survivin peptide ( Sur1M2- antiapoptotic protein ) , 1 CMV ( cytopeptide ( N495 ) . 2 . T cell therapy- T-cells isolated patient activated/expanded ex vivo antiCD3/28 bead . This two-site study University Pennsylvania University Maryland recruit total fifty-six study patient . The key eligibility criterion patient systemic multifocal myeloma require autologous stem cell transplantation . After enrollment , patient divide two arm ( A B ) accord HLA A2 status ( A = HLA A2 + , B = HLA A2- ) . Patients ARM A initially immunize hTERT vaccine along pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) ; patient ARM B initially immunize give booster PCV . All patient undergo T-cell harvest , stem cell mobilization collection , high-dose chemotherapy , autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) , infusion expand T cell day 2 ASCT . Patients ARM A receive three hTERT/PCV vaccine booster day 14 , 42 , 90 ASCT .</detailed_description>
