	<brief_summary>Combination therapy pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin greatly improve treatment efficacy mainstream treatment chronic hepatitis C infection . The efficacy safety pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin combination therapy impact outcome chronic hepatitis C patient concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma deserve elucidate . The purpose study : 1 . To evaluate efficacy safety pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin combination therapy chronic hepatitis C patient concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma . 2 . To investigate role baseline on-treatment factor response pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin combination therapy chronic hepatitis C patient concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin Hepatitis C Patients Concomitant With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , hospital-based study enrol 100 chronic hepatitis C patient concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma sex- age-matched 100 chronic hepatitis C patient without malignancy conduct . The 100 chronic hepatitis C patient concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma receive pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin combination therapy remission phase oncological treatment and/or intervention . The 100 chronic hepatitis C patient without malignancy receive antiviral therapy serve control . The primary outcome measurement sustain virological response safety , whilst secondary measurement rapid virological early virological response .</detailed_description>
