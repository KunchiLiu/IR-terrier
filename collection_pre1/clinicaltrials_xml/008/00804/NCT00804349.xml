	<brief_summary>Heart Failure affect 5-6 million Americans 550 thousand new case heart failure every year . There approximately 3 million hospital admission acute decompensated heart failure hospital readmission rate 20 % 30 day 50 % 60 day , cost 20 billion dollar per year . In previous study discover sleep disordered breathe prevalent 70 % patient acute decompensated heart failure . We hypothesize , detection treatment sleep disorder breathe acute decompensated heart failure patient reduce episodic hypoxic event acute decompensation may decrease hospital length stay reduce future readmission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Sleep Disordered Breathing In Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Heart failure ( HF ) affect 5 6 million Americans increase prevalence . There 550,000 new case heart failure every year 3 million admission acute decompensated heart failure every year . Despite advance medical care , hospital readmission rate 20 % one month 50 % six month . The total cost heart failure health system upwards 35 billion dollar per year . About half resource use acute hospitalization . An important limitation current approach management HF focus awake patient . This approach underestimate mechanism might contribute pathophysiology progression HF . Sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) common congestive heart failure . Recently , adverse implication SDB patient HF appreciate . Intermittent apnea-induced hypoxia , hypercapnia , surge central sympathetic outflow leave ventricular afterload , daytime hypertension , loss vagal heart rate regulation potent stimuli myocyte necrosis apoptosis , myocardial ischemia , arrhythmia , adverse cardiac remodeling , result accelerated disease progression HF . This make u believe treatment SDB acute decompensated heart failure addition standard medical therapy ( SMT ) would beneficial . Study Design : 80 eligible patient admit Albert Einstein Medical Center diagnosis Acutely Decompensated Heart Failure recruit study . Once patient identify , inclusion exclusion criterion meet , consent participate trial within 24 48 hour admission hospital . After enrollment , patient screen SDB NEXAN CPS system . The Sensor , flexible data collection patch adhere patient 's chest , continuously record ECG , respiratory , oximetry data allow future use evaluation . Patients SDB randomize SDB monitor SDB monitoring plus Autotitratable Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( APAP ) treatment arm . Patients arm treat standard care therapy acute heart failure . There possibility patient randomize APAP therapy may refuse treatment first night . These patient analyze basis intention treat approach Once randomize , patient fit NEXAN Clear Path System continue wear time discharge 7 day . Those treatment group fit Autotitratable Continuous Positive Airway Pressure device continue treatment discharge maximum 7 day . Follow-up patient include 15 day 60 day phone call 30 day office visit . At 30 day visit patient ask use NEXAN sensor night , return equipment next day . The patient determine sleep-disordered breathing refer full overnight polysomnography test .</detailed_description>
