	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lapatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , ixabepilone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lapatinib together ixabepilone may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose lapatinib give together ixabepilone treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ixabepilone Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety feasibility lapatinib ditosylate combination ixabepilone patient advance solid tumor . Secondary - To determine maximum-tolerated dose regimen patient . - To assess , preliminarily , efficacy regimen patient . - To perform laboratory correlative study tissue blood specimen patient investigate potential predictor response . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily day 1-28 ixabepilone IV day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archival tumor tissue sample collect EGFR/HER2 pathway analyse via immunohistochemistry , mRNA analysis via RT-PCR , EGFR mutation analysis , Kras braf mutation analysis via sequencing , RAS mutation via PCR sequence . Blood sample also collect periodically tumor DNA proteomics , acetylate alpha-tubulin analysis , EGFR-HER2 pathway genotype , pharmacogenomics . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
