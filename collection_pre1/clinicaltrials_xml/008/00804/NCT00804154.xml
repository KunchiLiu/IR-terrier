	<brief_summary>This study examine safety give experimental drug , resiniferatoxin ( RTX ) , treat severe pain patient advance cancer . RTX chemical extract cactus-like plant . It similar capsaicin , active ingredient hot pepper . RTX relieve pain reduce need pain medication several animal experiment . It work destroy nerve transmit pain information . People least 18 year age severe pain advanced cancer level chest control standard treatment may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Pretreatment Visit Before begin treatment RTX , patient give medical history undergo physical examination include : - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) - Blood draw - Urinalysis - Neurological examination - Peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) - Eye examination - MRI - Urology assessment - Pregnancy test , appropriate - Questionnaires collect information health , personality , mood , pain level symptom . 2-Day Hospitalization Patients hospitalize 2 day RTX injection monitoring , follow : - RTX injection : RTX inject operating room general anesthesia . It give catheter placed patient spine . The catheter also use obtain sample cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) clear fluid bathe spinal cord . The fluid examine assess drug effect side effect , chemical change content CSF associate RTX , RTX handle body . - Post-injection monitoring , include : - Surveys symptoms pain weakness - Neurological examination - Blood CSF sample - EKG - AEs Outpatient followup - Vitals - Blood draw , Urinalysis , neurological sensory testing , EKG day 7 , 14 30 injection - MRI scan head back , Urology assessment PEFR day 15 injection - Eye examination - Follow-up phone call monthly 6 month</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resiniferatoxin Treat Severe Pain Associated With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain continue major problem patient advance cancer . Resiniferatoxin ( RTX ) , potent member family drug include capsaicin , selectively irreversibly destroys neuron ( axon ) transmit chronic pain sensation . Intrathecal injection RTX several animal specie demonstrate high level safety , specificity , efficacy treat severe pain . This first-in-human , dose-escalation study investigate intrathecal administration RTX cancer patient severe pain . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To investigate safety efficacy RTX administer intrathecally subject severe refractory pain associate advanced cancer . STUDY POPULATION : Up 45 subject accrue across several research site . Eligible subject great equal 18 year age , clinical histological diagnosis advance malignancy , severe pain due malignancy level chest adequately relieve pain control therapy . DESIGN : This multi-site , non-randomized , open-label , dose-escalation study use modify Fibonacci scheme . The start dose RTX 13 microgram ( mcg ) . Doses increase progressively small percentage increment . Dose escalation occur sequential group 3 subject 1 escalation effective dose 100 % subject ( ED100 ) , completion 166 mirco g dose level , establishment maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , whichever occur first . The total duration study participation subject 7 month . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary study outcome ED100 , MTD , maximum dose administer , whichever achieve first dose escalation . The primary pain variable determine ED100 daily bad pain score average 7-day period 3 week RTX dose Days 8 14 dosing . The numerical rating scale ( NRS ) , administer verbally daily telephone interview , primary pain assessment instrument . For give subject , treatment consider effective subject experience great equal 50 % reduction mean daily bad pain score assess NRS . Secondary outcome measure survey pain , include assessment bad daily pain visual analog scale , assessment function quality life . Safety assessment include hematology ; serum clinical chemistry test ; cerebrospinal fluid examination ; physical , neurological , eye examination ; report adverse event ; electrocardiogram ; finding magnetic resonance image spine brain .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patient inclusion criterion base inadequate control pain despite best effort include appropriate use medication ( ) . Thus , criterion include follow : 1 . Age 18 year old . 2 . Clinical histological diagnosis cancer disease adequately respond standard therapy . A pathology report document malignancy require . 3 . Subject currently seek receive potentially curative therapy cancer ( e.g. , chemotherapy immunotherapy ) . Curative cancer therapy may seek Day 15 clinic visit , palliative antitumor therapy allow long subject establish therapy prior enrollment ( see exclusion criterion 7 ) . 4 . Mean daily bad pain NRS score great equal 6 pain T6 dermatome ( level chest ) associate malignant disease . The mean score must derive recording least 4 7 consecutive day within 3 week precede treatment . 5 . Alternative method pain control sufficiently effective , indicate , tolerate , and/or refuse subject , determine Pain Palliative Care Service ( PPCS ) . Alternative method pain control include , limited , follow : Opioids ( route administration include neuraxial infustion ) Adjuvant pain medication antidepressant , corticosteroid , local anesthetic , antiseizure medication Procedures catheter implantable pump placement delivery analgesic medication neurolytic intervention ( include intercostal , superior hypogastric , celiac plexus block ) Complementary medicine approach Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation Radiation therapy 6 . Reasonable expectation subject able complete study 30day followup . 7 . Medical clearance refer physician ( ) , include statement indicate adequate recovery period previous trials/medication . 8 . Formal review subject medical record write approval his/her inclusion study 3 separate person : Principal Investigator ( PI ) Associate Investigator ( AI ) Medical oncologist oncologic surgeon A member PPCS NIH institution 's equivalent site . 9. International normalize ratio ( INR ; prothrombin time [ PT ] ) &lt; 1.5 partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) less equal upper limit reference range . The INR PTT may correct ( e.g. , administration blood product , vitamin K , etc . ) , provide repeat blood draw confirm value meet inclusion criterion . 10 . Platelet count great equal 50,000/mm3 . Platelets transfuse necessary raise platelet count great equal 100,000/mm3 prior dose . 11 . Ability stop anticoagulant ( e.g. , Coumadin ) antiplatelet therapy ( e.g. , aspirin ) intrathecal catheter placement accord accept medical guideline . 12 . Ability willingness undergo complete eye examination . 13 . Ability read , speak , understand English , willingness complete study tool form . 14 . For woman childbearing potential men partner childbearing potential , ability willingness use effective method contraception study . Effective method birth control include : 1. hormonal contraception ( birth control pill , inject hormone , vaginal ring ) , 2. intrauterine device , 3. barrier method ( condom diaphragm ) combine spermicide , 4. surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , tubal ligation , vasectomy ) . 15 . Availability responsible adult live subject Day 15 visit . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude study meet follow criterion : 1 . Primary pain source anatomical region T5 dermatome . 2 . Pain due cause cancer treatment moderate severe intensity . 3 . Anatomic abnormality pathology spinal cord and/or intrathecal space magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) could increase risk adverse effect intrathecal catheter placement interfere CSF flow . 4 . Evidence advance brain pathology elevate intracranial pressure determine symptom , history , physical examination ( include neurological eye examination ) , and/or MRI . 5 . Presence intrathecal shunt device ( e.g. , ventriculoperitoneal ventriculoatrial shunt ) . 6 . Anticipating initiation palliative antitumor therapy significant change current palliative antitumor therapy completion Day 15 visit . 7 . Documented allergy chili pepper capsaicin ( e.g. , hive , wheal ) . 8 . Contraindication MRI MRI contrast . 9 . Female subject pregnant lactating . 10 . Clinically significant disorder condition might interfere study participation greatly increase safety risk subject , judge study investigator . 11 . Planned use another investigational agent , therapy , device within 30 day dose .</criteria>
