	<brief_title>Evaluation Biocompatibility Cartridge Blood Set Versus Standard Blood Line</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interactions blood component ( cell proteins ) extracorporeal circuit induce activation several biological system platelet , complement coagulation cascade . The coagulation system generate key enzyme , factor IIa thrombin , responsible blood clot dialysis circuit Because clot circuit may reduce dialysis efficiency , anticoagulation extracorporeal circuit need . For several year , research mainly focused improvement biocompatibility dialysis membrane . The contribution various component dialysis circuit coagulation activation clearly establish . A circuit integrate cartridge blood set commercialise several year . The design cartridge blood set reduces surface contact blood minimizes blood air interface well know source coagulation activation . The aim study collect data evaluate biocompatibility two type blood circuit ( cartridge blood set vs standard blood line ) .</detailed_description>
