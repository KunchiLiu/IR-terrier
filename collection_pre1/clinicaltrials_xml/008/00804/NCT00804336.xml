	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety combination SOM230 RAD001 , well determine high dose combination give people safely . SOM230 investigational drug similar Sandostatin LAR . Sandostatin approve drug use treat symptom neuroendocrine tumor . SOM230 show effective patient become resistant Sandostatin may also stop cancer cell grow . RAD001 investigational drug also may stop cancer cell grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pasireotide Combination With RAD001 Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants receive two study medication , SOM230 RAD001 , treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 4 week . - For first four week treatment , participant self-administer SOM230 twice day subcutaneous injection . If tolerate SOM230 4 week , switch long-acting SOM230 administer schedule treatment visit every 4 week . For first two week switch long-acting SOM230 , participant continue self-administer short-acting SOM230 twice day . - RAD001 take orally every day . - On Day 1 every cycle , physical exam blood test perform . Following every 2 cycle treatment assessment tumor CT scan wil perform . - Pharmacokinetic ( pK ) blood sample take day 1 15 cycle one . The pK sample take right study drug administer 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 hour later .</detailed_description>
