	<brief_title>Efficacy And Safety Of The Uro-EaseÂ® Urinary Catheter During Clean Intermittent Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary retention occur among men Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy ( BPH ) Neurologic co-morbidities . Many men treat Clean Intermittent Catheterization ( CIC . For , time consume often painful process due difficulty catheter insertion manipulation , may result urethral injury non-compliance . The blunt nose standard catheter meet significant resistance external sphincter within prostate urethra . Spirus Medical develop urinary catheter , Uro-Ease , round helical thread form surface distal end use CIC . This study determine whether design Uro-Ease catheter allow easy Clean Intermittent self-Catheterization ( CIC ) maintain safe bladder drainage . This prospective randomize study two phase . Phase 1 : Observational , 5 patient . In phase , five patient meet inclusion criterion consent Urology Clinic . Participating Urology nurse previously train utilization Spirus Catheter , perform initial CIC patient 12 Fr Spirus Catheter ( choice 2 different flexibility ) . The study nurse document time per catheterization effective drainage bladder . Before leave clinic , patient 's instruct use Spirus Catheter demonstrate efficacy use Spirus Catheter . Patients fill VAS Forms ease comfort catheter insertion subsequent catheterization . Patients also record , 3 consecutive day , time take catheterization time drain bladder . Patients return clinic 1 week return VAS form documentation . A follow-up phone call make patient month check patient 's status . All patient instruct call clinic , nurse on-call-urologist report urethral trauma , evaluate flexible cystoscopy . These report review document . Phase 2 : Randomized crossover trial , 20 patient . After successful completion Phase 1 , patient randomize 2 groups-10 patient first randomize Spirus Catheter Group 10 patient Standard 12 FR Bard Catheter Group . ( Coude ' straight catheter may utilize standard group ) As Phase 1 , patient receive CIC instruction self-catheterization , specific select catheter demonstrate efficacy CIC use select catheter , leave clinic . Patients fill VAS form catheter insertion ease comfort subsequent catheterization . Patient also record time per catheterization bladder drainage 3 consecutive day . Patients return clinic 1 week progress report , return VAS form report . At time patient switch alternate catheter group 1 week . All patient instruct call clinic , nurse on-call-urologist report urethral trauma , define blood catheter per meatus . Any occurence urethral trauma evaluate flexible cystoscopy . These report review document . All patient follow one month check patient 's status .</detailed_description>
