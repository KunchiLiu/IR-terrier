	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate SynergEyes SA Hybrid Contact Lens clinical performance substantially equivalent SynergEyes A Hybrid Lens study : - within correspond range lens power - population randomize within multiple investigational site - study ration 2/1 test v control lenses - duration 90 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hybrid SA RGP Center/S-H Skirt Daily Wear 90 Day Multicenter Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study compare SynergEyes SA Hybrid Contact Lens ( Test ) SynergEyes A Hybrid Contact lens ( Control ) use daily wear regimen non-diseased eye correction myopia ( -0.25 -6.00Diopters ) -2.50 Diopters astigmatism . The population randomize 2/1 ratio Test/Control 90 day . The study objective complete least 40 subject Test material 20 subject Control material . The purpose study demonstrate SynergEyes SA Hybrid Contact Lens clinical performance substantially equivalent SynergEyes A Hybrid Lens study within correspond range power population randomize within investigational site produce 2/1 ratio Test vs. Control lenses .</detailed_description>
