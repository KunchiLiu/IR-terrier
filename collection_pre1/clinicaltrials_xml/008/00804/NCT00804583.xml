	<brief_summary>This study examine `` modifier gene '' may play role development CF liver disease . Modifier gene gene , CF gene ( CFTR ) , may directly indirectly affect body respond condition develop result defective CFTR gene . Scientists wonder patient CF develop CF liver disease patient CF . To good understand problem , study design examine genetic makeup CF patient consider severe liver disease see identify modifier gene . Researchers study blood sample , pulmonary function test , medical information hop connection make genetic make-up severe liver disease . The identification modifier gene influence disease severity may ultimately lead good understand CF liver disease , may useful development new treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The clinical heterogeneity cystic fibrosis ( CF ) partly explain mutation CFTR gene . Most CF patient evidence liver dysfunction focal biliary cirrhosis ( fibrosis ) , subset patient ( 5-7 % ) progress severe liver disease ( CFLD ) , define portal hypertension multilobular cirrhosis . The development CFLD relationship specific CFTR mutation biomarkers , currently way identify CF infant develop severe liver disease . The central hypothesis proposal development CFLD reflect influence non-CFTR `` modifier '' allele ( gene ) . This project design identify association non-CFTR gene CFLD , test biological effect select allele hepatic fibrosis transgenic murine model . We hypothesize polymorphisms multiple gene , conceptual mechanistic link liver disease , increase risk develop end-stage CF liver disease , interaction among risk factor define pathophysiology disorder . To achieve goal , study 400 CF patient well-documented severe liver disease portal hypertension , 400 gender genotype-matched CF patient &gt; age 15 year evidence CFLD . We propose identify heritable risk factor development CFLD evaluation functional sequence variant within , single nucleotide polymorphism associate , multiple gene associate CFLD pathogenesis . To test ( `` validate '' ) biological effect ( impact ) select genetic allele liver fibrosis , develop transgenic mouse homozygous DF508 , also express additional candidate gene modifier allele . Better definition complex genotype increase risk severe liver disease CF allow early identification CF infant predispose develop end-stage liver disease , thereby allow test currently available therapy . Better understand pathobiology hepatic fibrosis CF identify novel target prevent ( reduce ) development CFLD .</detailed_description>
