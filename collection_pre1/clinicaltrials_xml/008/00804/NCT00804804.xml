	<brief_summary>The aim study determine impact age , circadian rhythm sleep deprivation executive performance . Volunteers complete 40-hour extended wakefulness period constant condition ( semi-recumbent posture bed , constant dim light level &lt; 10 lux , food liquid intake regular interval ) order control circadian system . The volunteer allow sleep sleep deprivation protocol ( `` high sleep pressure protocol '' ) adopt short wakefulness/sleep cycle ( 150/75 minute ) multiple nap protocol ( `` low sleep pressure protocol '' ) . Tests scale repeat every 3H45</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Social evolution ( nocturnal activity , shift work ) consequently reduce average sleep duration average . In addition , age lead physiological reduction nocturnal sleep duration . Many study show extended wakefulness impairs nocturnal performance measure simple reaction time test ( SRTT ) decrement also age-related . In deed , young subject ( 20-30 year ) affect old subject ( 50-60 year ) extend wakefulness period . The result obtain confinement constant condition , associate high low sleep pressure , show difference observe young old subject essentially relate reduced circadian regulation ( ex : reduce melatonin secretion ) age rather reduce sleep pressure ( homeostatic regulation ) previously suggest . However , study confinement show sleep pressure ( identified sleep period EEG delta band ) could reduce age specifically anterior brain region ( frontal region ) . It well-known executive performance ( related frontal lobe function ) affect extended wakefulness , respective effect age , circadian system sleep pressure decrement remain unknown . The aim study determine evolution executive function 40-hour extended wakefulness period ( `` high sleep pressure protocol '' ) multiple nap protocol ( `` low sleep pressure protocol '' ) accord subject ' age , constant experimental condition confinement . It 's repeat measurement study protocol ( sleep deprivation multiple nap ) time day within factor age group ( young versus old subject ) factor</detailed_description>
