	<brief_title>Contrast-Enhanced MRI Women With Ductal Breast Carcinoma Situ Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To compare ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) -optimized MRI standard clinical MRI , term conspicuity DCIS lesion , agreement disease extent biopsy , overall image quality ( i.e. , artifact level , uniformity fat suppression , contrast noise ratio signal noise ratio ) , woman DCIS breast . - To compare two DCIS-optimized MRIs variability enhancement level DCIS . - To examine effect menstrual cycle variability background enhancement level healthy volunteer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo standard clinical contrast-enhanced MRI approximately 30-45 minute . No 3 day later , patient undergo ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) -optimized contrast-enhanced MRI . - Arm II : Patients undergo DCIS-optimized contrast-enhanced MRI approximately 30-45 minute . No 3 day later , patient undergo second DCIS-optimized contrast-enhanced MRI . Healthy volunteer undergo DCIS-optimized contrast-enhanced MRI arm II .</detailed_description>
