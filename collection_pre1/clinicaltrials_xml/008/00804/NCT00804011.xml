	<brief_title>Automatic Tube Compensation ( ATC ) Weaning Patients With Severe Neurotoxic Snake Envenoming</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Snake envenom common medical emergency encounter tropical country , estimate 35,000 50,000 people die snake bite every year India . The bite Elapid snake cause predominantly neurotoxicity , manifest paralysis muscle eye , tongue , throat respiration , lead respiratory failure , untreated death . The management patient include ventilatory support administration snake anti-venom ( SAV ) . Respiratory failure , require mechanical ventilatory support , frequent cause admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Mechanical ventilation life-saving intervention improvement underlie indication mechanical ventilation , withdrawn abruptly majority . However , approximately 20-30 % patient still require gradual discontinuation i.e . wean . This process difficult patient chronic respiratory disease neuromuscular disorder like neurotoxic snake bite , also associate significant complication like pneumonia , prolong ICU stay even mortality , especially persistent weaning failure . In mechanically ventilated patient , long recognize single greatest cause impose work breathing ( WOB ) resistance cause endotracheal tube ( ETT ) . Commonly use maneuver overcome ETT resistance include use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) pressure support ( PS ) . However , new mode ventilatory support call automatic tube compensation ( ATC ) deliver exactly amount pressure necessary overcome resistive load impose endotracheal tube flow measure time ( call variable pressure support ) . This mode theoretically decrease wean duration increase probability successful extubation decrease WOB . Recently , report ICU data 55 patient severe neurotoxic snake envenom evaluate usage high dosage SAV offer significant clinical advantage lower dose , find difference high-dose low-dose group . The aim study evaluate whether combination PS ATC superior PS alone wean patient severe neurotoxic snake envenoming .</detailed_description>
