	<brief_summary>Background : Hypoglycemia common presentation Emergency Department . Management traditionally involve rapid administration IV 50 % dextrose dextrose contain IV fluid addition oral carbohydrate . Hypoglycemic patient take insulin often times treated outline safely discharge home period short observation Emergency Department . This procedure also follow pre-hospital care arena , insulin-dependent hypoglycemic patient often treat release . In addition diet-control insulin , patient diabetes maintain outpatient euglycemia class drug call sulfonylurea agent . This believed stimulate insulin release pancreatic beta cell via complex mechanism culminate calcium influx release store insulin secretory granule within pancreas . Whereas insulin-dependent diabetic patient usually discharge home establish normal blood glucose level , hospital admission generally recommend hypoglycemic patient take oral sulfonylurea due long duration effect delay clearance drug metabolites subsequent high likelihood recurrent hypoglycemic episode . Octreotide somatostatin analog know suppress numerous hormone include insulin . Dextrose induces insulin secretion thus theoretically contribute rebound hypoglycemia use treat hypoglycemia . Octreotide think block elevate insulin level result sulfonlyureas dextrose . Recent case report one prospective study healthy volunteer demonstrate safety efficacy octreotide administration treatment sulfonylurea induce hypoglycemia . Based largely result study expert field toxicology argue administration octreotide standard therapy patient recurrent hypoglycemic episode know take sulfonylurea . Purpose : Measure difference serum glucose incidence hypoglycemia two group sulfonylurea-dependent patient ; control group receive standard therapy experimental group receive standard therapy plus octreotide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : All adult ( &gt; 18 year old ) non-pregnant patient present Emergency Department hypoglycemia ( serum glucose &lt; 60 mg/dl ) identify screen inclusion ED physicians research staff . Hypoglycemic patient whose glucose-control medication involve insulin exclude . All patient whose medication involve oral sulfonlyureas combination insulin sulfonylurea ask participate study . Patients require read sign inform consent outline objective risks/ benefit propose protocol . In addition reading consent , detail study explain verbally trained emergency medicine research assistant patient give opportunity question answer . Study patient randomize one two treatment arm . 1 . Standard treatment placebo One ampule ( 50 mL ) IV 50 % dextrose , oral carbohydrate placebo ( 1cc 0.9 % Normal Saline subcutaneuously ) 2 . Standard treatment plus 75 microgram octreotide subcutaneously . Enrolled patient receive additional maintenance IV glucose fluid unless become hypoglycemic ( serum glucose &lt; 60 mg/dL ) , case receive bolus dos IV 50 % dextrose re-evaluated . All enrol patient admitted hospital monitor recurrent hypoglycemic episode . Bedside glucose determination collect hourly 4 hour follow repeated calculation every 2 hour . Data point collect include mean serum glucose , number hypoglycemic episode ( &lt; 60mg/dl ) total quantity dextrose require maintain euglycemia . In likely event hypoglycemia diagnose pre-hospital setting patient receive IV 50 % dextrose prior arrival Emergency Department , rapid bedside glucose determination obtain &lt; 60 mg/dl second bolus IV 50 % dextrose give patient screen approached participation . If emergency department serum glucose &gt; 60mg/dl patient screen approached participation without second bolus IV 50 % dextrose .</detailed_description>
