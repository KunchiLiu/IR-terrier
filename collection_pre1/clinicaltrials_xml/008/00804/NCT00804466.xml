	<brief_summary>Background : - Cervical cancer cause persistent infection line cervix kind human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) . These HPV infection distantly relate virus cause wart skin . Like common wart virus , woman cervical infection HPV resolve infection within 2 year without need treatment . Cervical infection go away may cause disease turn cancer many year . - Only one study do Nigeria learn many woman HPV infection . The result study differed study world old woman much likely infect . This study learn whether result find previous study true Irun also , site current study . Objectives : - To examine age distribution HPV infection relationship cancer cervix among Nigerian woman . - To understand different screen method , include HPV testing , could best reduce risk cervical cancer Nigerian woman . Eligibility : - Women reside Irun , Nigeria , 15 year age old . Design : - Participants complete brief questionnaire relate demographic , household living condition longer survey question related reproductive history , family history , illness , stressful life event sexual history ( U. Michigan collaboration ) . - Participants cervical examination , HPV test , Pap test blood test . - Women whose test show infected HPV cervical disease follow : - see doctor cervical biopsy white abnormal area ( removal small tissue sample cervix ) - photograph cervix take - cervical scrap new kind HPV test . - Some woman normal test result also ask see doctor check validity test - Women cervical disease receive treatment specialist remain program treatment successfully complete final diagnosis reach . - Participants may contact followup 5 year final diagnosis make .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cervical cancer , cause persistent infection approximately 15-20 genotype carcinogenic human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection , second lead cause female cancer . Cytology ( Pap smear ) new HPV vaccine widely available poor region . Immediate treatment HPV-infected old woman cryotherapy might great impact . Although HPV type cause cervical cancer everywhere , stage ( infection , persistence vs. clearance , progression precancer , invasion ) typify cervical carcinogenesis , pattern age-specific prevalence HPV vary widely . These pattern important secondary prevention strategy rely HPV DNA test . In many region , include US , HPV infection appear classical sexually-transmitted agent , peak cervical DNA prevalence young age ( approximately 20 ) low prevalence old age . However , Nigeria , HPV prevalence high ( great equal 15 % ) age accord one study perform urban Ibadan Franceschi group IARC ( n=932 woman ) . This pattern uncommon . High prevalence age would preclude use HPV test low-cost strategy , due poor positive predictive value . One possibly relevant element marital structure Nigeria ; man often multiple wife . OBJECTIVES : The major objective : 1 ) To estimate age-specific HPV prevalence Irun , Nigeria ; 2 ) To investigate epidemiologic risk factor HPV cervical intraepithelial neoplasia population ; 3 ) To examine performance screening option ; 4 ) To assess correlation HPV among co-wives , compare household multiple wife single wife ; 5 ) To validate performance rapid HPV , inexpensive HPV test design public-sector use setting like Irun . ELIGIBILITY : All non-pregnant woman age 15+ , without hysterectomy , eligible provide write informed consent . Unmarried woman le 21 enrolled parental consent . Sexually active woman examine asked cervical specimen ; self-reported virginal woman ask 10-ml blood sample . DESIGN : This cross-sectional screening study 1500 woman Irun , Nigerian village . Unlike IARC study , incorporate cytology , visual inspection , colposcopic biopsy woman test positive three screen test . We determine whether HPV infection various age relate risk cervical abnormality . The analysis include descriptive trend data , multivariable model HPV determinant , clinical epidemiologic analysis relative screening test performance detect cervical neoplasia .</detailed_description>
