	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine selumetinib safe effective treating patient cancer mutate BRAF gene . Selumetinib investigational drug work block protein call MEK , know play role growth cancer cell line tumor mutate BRAF gene . There multiple type cancer mutation BRAF gene depend activity gene growth survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selumetinib Cancers With BRAF Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) patient cancer melanoma BRAF mutation identify prospectively . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival subject treat AZD6244 . II . To obtain preliminary estimate objective response rate non-small cell lung cancer colon cancer BRAF mutation . III . To explore biologic correlate responsiveness AZD6244 , specifically correlate AKT pathway activity sensitivity MEK inhibition BRAF mutant class tumor . IV . To estimate sensitivity specificity detection BRAF V600E mutation circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) use microfluidic platform ( 'CTC-chip ' ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 3 week . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
