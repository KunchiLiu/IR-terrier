	<detailed_description>ß-cell dysfunction insulin resistance main pathophysiological defect responsible development hyperglycaemia [ 1 ] . Both defect predict incident diabetes high-risk subject [ 2 ] . Insulin resistance per se sufficient cause hyperglycaemia ; mild degree ß-cell dysfunction , hand , may result diabetic hyperglycaemia insulin sensitive individual . It impair ß-cell function occur background insulin resistance plasma glucose level begin rise ( case individual impair glucose tolerance [ 3 ] ) . The occurrence postprandial , day-long , hyperglycaemia compromise ß-cell function insulin action , phenomenon call glucose toxicity [ 4-6 ] . As consequence , vast majority patient establish type 2 diabetes present , addition mark insulin resistance , clear defect ß-cell function , generally proportional severity hyperglycaemia [ 7 ] . Of note extent ß-cell dysfunction type 2 patient may misjudge ß-cell function infer simple measurement fast postprandial plasma insulin concentration . In fact , insulin secretion increase ( non-linear manner [ 8 ] ) insulin resistant individual , compensatory response aim maintain glucose tolerance . As consequence , absolute insulin hypersecretion ( particularly fast state ) commonly find patient IGT diabetes mask underlie defect ability ß-cell cope nutrient stimulation . It generally hold ß-cell function irreversibly lose already time disease manifest thereafter continue decline linearly time . Several study , however , documented possibility ß-cell function may restore , least partially , type 2 diabetes [ 9-13 ] . Of major relevance issue ß-cell recovery diabetes follow finding : ( ) bariatric surgery morbidly obese patient type 2 diabetes restore euglycaemia , acute insulin response glucose [ 14-17 ] insulin sensitivity [ 18,19 ] ; ( b ) recent study report diabetic subject return euglycaemia normal insulin level within day surgery , long significant weight loss occur [ 20 ] ; ( c ) whereas RYGB improve insulin sensitivity proportion weight loss , BPD improve insulin action proportion weight loss , i.e. , normalises time patient still markedly obese [ 21 ] . Because RYGB predominantly restrictive procedure involve foregut whereas BPD predominantly malabsorptive procedure involve distal GI tract , finding suggest control insulin action ß-cell function influence signal originate GI tract . Some study investigate hormonal change follow bariatric surgery . In case , however , clinical testing perform significant weight reduction , thereby make difficult establish whether observed hormonal effect cause consequence weight loss diabetes resolution . Recently , report RYGB induces rapid normalisation blood glucose insulin level concomitance significant change level hormone involve regulation glucose metabolism ( ACTH , leptin GIP ) early postoperative period [ 22 ] . It propose incretins could one key mediator anti-diabetic effect certain type bariatric surgery . Previous data show significant weight loss observe various bariatric procedure accompany improvement diabetes control increase GLP-1 level . However , study cross sectional [ 23,24 ] , report fasting [ 25 ] rather post-prandial GLP-1 level , compare various type surgery jejuno-ileal bypass ( JIB ) [ 26,27 ] bilio-pancreatic diversion ( BPD ) [ 27 ] , often lead inconclusive result . Data fast GIP level bariatric surgery inconsistent , report either decrease [ 25,28,29 ] increase [ 23,24 ] . GLP-1 level increase meal patient RY-GBP [ 30 ] oral glucose BPD [ 30 ] . Meal-stimulated GIP level report increase JIB [ 23 ] , decrease GBP , JIB BPD surgery [ 26,29,31,32 ] . None study , however , measure GLP-1 GIP simultaneously , report incretin level effect insulin secretion ( exception last quote one , report GIP insulin response meal markedly reduce BPD ) , do diabetic patient . Some author suggest enhanced release GLP-1 , trigger early presentation undigested food lower segment bowel , might involve glycaemic improvement consequent bypass procedure obesity surgery . Collectively , observation clearly suggest large margin ß-cell recovery function type 2 diabetes different segment gut participate differentially recovery . The primary end-points study difference proportion patient reach partial complete remission type 2 diabetes conventional therapy BPD conventional therapy RYGB . In particular , accord Buse et al ( Diabetes Care 2009 ; 32:2133-35 ) partial remission define fast glucose value 100-125 mg/dl [ 5.6-6.9 mmol/l ] ) HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % , least 1 year 's duration absence active pharmacologic therapy . Complete remission refer fast glucose &lt; 100 mg/dl [ 5.6 mmol/l ] ) HbA1c normal range least 1 year 's duration absence active pharmacologic therapy . Secondary endpoint Secondary endpoint include percentage change fast plasma glucose level , glycated hemoglobin , weight , waist circumference , blood pressure , cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol triglyceride , hard cardiovascular risk .</detailed_description>
