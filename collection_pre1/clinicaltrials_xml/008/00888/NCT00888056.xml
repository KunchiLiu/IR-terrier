	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) common cause dementia treatment show consistent efficacy stop slow disease . Recent report enhancement memory ability bilateral chronic deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) fornix hypothalamus suggests neuromodulation circuit involve memory process may therapeutic implication AD patient memory decline . The primary objective prospective , non-controlled , pilot study evaluate feasibility safety DBS AD patient mild cognitive memory impairment , evaluate efficacy DBS slow stabilize decline . Five patient AD ( DSM IV ) diagnose less two year , mild cognitive decline ( MMSE 20-24 ) , specific impairment episodic memory include 2-year period . The evaluation criterion feasibility proportion patient undergoing procedure , chronic stimulation evaluation process without adverse event ( AE ) . Efficacy evaluate use numerous cognitive memory test . Changes behavioral mood scale , change hypothalamic function ( clinical , biological hormonal assessment ) evaluate safety tolerance . Clinical , neuro-psychological , biological imaging assessment perform 3 one month 3 , 6 , 12 24 month surgery . Bilateral electrode ( Medtronic 3389 ) implant , MR-guided frame-based stereotaxy , hypothalamic part fornix , connect generator ( Kinetra , Medtronic ) . Chronic high-frequency stimulation deliver immediately surgery . The investigator expect slow , stabilize spontaneous decline MMSE ADAS score 6 , 12 24 month stimulation . In case efficacy , DBS might offer AD patient possibility slow down/stabilize symptom , treatment currently offer , increase quality life .</brief_summary>
