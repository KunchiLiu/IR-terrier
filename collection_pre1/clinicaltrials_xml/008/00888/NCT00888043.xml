	<detailed_description>Targeting molecular pathway tumor growth recently become major focus anti-cancer treatment . The VEGF pathway demonstrate significant mitogenic activity arterial , venous , lymphatic endothelial cell , induction vascular permeability extracellular remodeling , activity endothelial cell growth factor . The proof principle target VEGF pathway anti-cancer therapy demonstrate phase III trial anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab versus placebo combination chemotherapy metastatic colorectal cancer . In trial addition bevacizumab chemotherapy show statistically significant improvement overall survival subject ( 11 ) . Since trial , addition bevacizumab chemotherapy show beneficial non-small cell lung cancer subject metastatic breast cancer subject ( 9 , 12 ) . Integrins show essential component angiogenesis . One best-characterized integrins tumor-induced angiogenesis αvβ3 . Angiogenesis dramatically up-regulates integrin αvβ3 expression endothelial cell ( 13 ) . Integrin αvβ3 link cell migration invasion ( 14 ) , cell survival ( 15 ) . Inhibition αvβ3 result apoptosis endothelial cell ( 16 ) inhibition microvascular network formation ( 17 ) . The signal pathway activate αvβ3 VEGF act synergistically formation microvascular network ( 17 ) . Both αvβ3 VEGF activate Src , Ras , PI3K , Erk cascade ( 18 ) . CNTO 95 fully humanize monoclonal antibody block integrin αvβ3 high affinity . The combination different targeted therapy potential provide complete inhibition angiogenesis . It hypothesis combination CNTO 95 bevacizumab safe potentially efficacious anti-angiogenesis strategy treatment adult solid tumor . This combination may utility directly may prove useful subsequently combine anti-angiogenic agent standard chemotherapy regimen . We also hypothesize clinical dermal wound angiogenesis assay help quantify characterize anti-angiogenic contribution agent combination . Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) humanize monoclonal antibody VEGF . VEGF know play pivotal role tumor angiogenesis significant mitogenic stimulus arterial , venous lymphatic endothelial cell . The addition bevacizumab chemotherapy show increase overall response rate , duration response survival patient metastatic colon cancer ( 4 ) beneficial first line non-small cell lung cancer metastatic breast cancer [ 1 , 2 ] , second line metastatic colorectal cancer ( 7 ) . VEGF signal phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) Akt well extracellular regulate kinase ( ERK 1/2 ) , mitogen activate protein kinase ( MAPK ) . VEGF 's multiple biologic action may mediate different pathway . Erikkson demonstrate VEGF induce hyperpermeability highly dependent activation AKT pathway , angiogenic effect largely unaffected block pathway likely depend ERK activation [ 3 ] . CNTO 95 fully human mAb immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) gamma isotype kappa light chain show antiangiogenic antitumor property . Results vitro study demonstrate CNTO 95 anti-αv integrin antibody bind block integrin ανβ3 high affinity . CNTO 95 also show bind integrins ανβ1 , ανβ5 , ανβ6 . No cross-reactivity CNTO 95 glycoprotein IIb/IIIa , ανβ1 platelets observe . By bind block ανβ3 ανβ5 integrins , CNTO 95 inhibit cell adhesion , migration , proliferation , invasion tumor endothelial cell vitro . It know CNTO 95 bind αν integrins . However , clinical implication bind integrins unknown .</detailed_description>
