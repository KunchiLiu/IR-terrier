	<brief_summary>Background : - People many different disease symptom fatigue , general sense tiredness ; however , cause fully understood . Fatigue symptom may relate person level fitness , health , blood chemistry . - Researchers study potential role plasma cytokine ( signal molecule ) hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis ( part neuroendocrine system control stress ) functioning symptom fatigue . Objectives : - To characterize symptom fatigue healthy individual . - To collect information fatigue , pain , depression , stress , sleepiness , quality life healthy adult age . - To compare result obtained people various illness well understand possible cause fatigue associate disease . Eligibility : - Physically mentally healthy volunteers18 year age old speak read English language . - Exclusion criterion include individual disease condition cause significant fatigue ( congestive heart failure , cancer , sleep disorder ) , individual take medicine cause fatigue ( beta blocker , diuretic , narcotic ) , individual major psychiatric condition ( major depression , anxiety disorder , schizophrenia ) . - The following individual may participate : two alcoholic drink per day , use illicit drug , drink 4 cup coffee , 8 cup soda tea , similar amount caffeine-containing beverage day , eat 1 pound chocolate per day ; individual work evening night shift past month . - Women pregnant breastfeed eligible . Design : - Participants must make two outpatient visit Clinical Center . Each visit last 5 hour participant must refrain smoke consume alcohol caffeine least 24 hour . - During first study visit , researcher conduct follow test : - Psychiatric interview , medical history , pregnancy test , drug test . - Urine test measure level stress hormone . - Questionnaires measure fatigue , pain , depression , stress , daytime sleepiness , activity . - Physical fitness test , include strength test , walk test , physical activity monitoring . - Before second study visit , patient must refrain smoke consume caffeine alcohol least 24 hour nothing , even water , mouth midnight . During second study visit , follow test conduct : - Stress hormone test ( participant receive cortisol-releasing hormone ) . - Four intravenous blood draw determine cytokine profile , gene expression , level stress hormone ( immune gentic analysis ) . - Participants receive small financial compensation participation study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol design characterize symptom fatigue healthy individual use standardized questionnaire determine physical activity , pain , depression , fatigue catastrophizing , stress , daytime sleepiness play role experience . This study also examine potential role plasma cytokine hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA ) functioning symptom fatigue healthy individual . Eligible participant complete questionnaire measure fatigue , pain , depression , fatigue catastrophizing , perceive stress , daytime sleepiness , neurological health , physical activity . Participants also perform strength testing ( e.g . hand grip ) , walk test ( 6-minute walk test ) , exercise test treadmill , physical activity monitoring use portable activity device . Blood sample obtain determine cytokine profile , gene expression , level stress hormone ( cortisol , dehydroepiandrosterone [ DHEA ] , catecholamine ) . Urine sample also obtain measure level stress hormone excrete . Information collect protocol use make comparison subject experience extreme symptom fatigue due many different disorder , order well understand mechanism fatigue .</detailed_description>
