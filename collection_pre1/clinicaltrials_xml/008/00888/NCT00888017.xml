	<brief_summary>Previous research study show may connection proton pump inhibitor therapy hip fracture adult ( 1 ) . Proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) reflux medication raise pH stomach , may effect body 's ability absorb certain calcium compound . Neonates crucial age bone mineralization . Because esophageal reflux common neonate , PPI therapy commonly use , despite little information effectiveness side effect . PPIs work block production proton pump stomach , thus make stomach less acidic . The calcium ion need acidic environment order broken natural compound absorbable form ( 2 ) . This trouble problem associate osteopenia neonate . Bone mineralization important premature infant . Rickets bone fracture high preterm infant term infant . For reason , investigate whether connection PPI therapy ( specifically Prevacid ) decrease bone density neonates . The objective determine connection exist proton pump inhibitor antacid decrease rate bone mineralization neonate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After patient screen consent obtain , participant initially place group one . Patients later move group two treatment include proton pump inhibitor . Group 1 : Patients meet selection criterion currently receive treatment reflux exclude condition . Group 2 : Patients meet selection criterion receive proton pump inhibitor part treatment NBICU . Participants group receive bone density ultrasound begin full feed , every two week follow discharge . Participants ask participate scan post discharge . Because baby begin GER therapy time reach full feeding , place group two retrospectively . During participate infant 's hospital stay , follow procedure perform : Each infant undergo test procedure would normally do his/her care include physical exam , vital sign , monitor respiratory status . Each infant weigh his/her length head circumference also measure . This also standard care . After initial scan , participate infant receive subsequent bone density ultrasounds every two week time discharge . These bone ultrasounds do study personnel charge patient patient 's insurance . The medication evaluate study experimental . Patient care discretion treat physician . Standard care treatment affect study . The procedure include study standard care bone ultrasound , three week apart ( number ultrasounds depend discharge , death , exclude criterion ) .</detailed_description>
