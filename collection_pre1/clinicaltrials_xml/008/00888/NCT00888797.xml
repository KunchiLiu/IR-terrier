	<brief_summary>Colon rectal cancer second prevalent malignant disease western world , cause significant morbidity , mortality , healthcare source use . Treating colon rectal cancer curative intent generally include resection primary tumor . Despite crucial role , surgery induce physiological change result significant immune depression physiological perturbation , may turn play significant role initiation new metastasis progression pre-existing dormant metastasis . The aim study ass use perioperative medical intervention use combination β-adrenergic blocker ( Propranolol ) COX2 inhibitor ( Etodolac ) , order attenuate surgically induced immunosuppression physiological perturbation , aim reduce rate tumor recurrence distant metastatic disease .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients plan surgery primary resection colon rectal cancer curative intent . Single colonic rectal carcinoma , proofed full colonoscopy tumor biopsy . If colonoscopy fail reach cecum , proximal colonic investigation make use contract enema CT colonography . No evidence metastatic disease prior surgery . Minimal workup would include abdominal CT IV contrast ( CT+liver US ) chest XR . Age 18 75 year old . ASA score 13 The patient able understand study objectives procedure , able comply protocol , capable sign inform consent . Patients metastatic disease , know prior surgery . Patients metastatic disease find surgery complete intervention phase , follow additional month potential complication , exit study allow potential participation clinical trial . Patients surgical resection plan without curative intent . Patients renal failure , measure Creatinine level &gt; 1.5 Patients significant heart failure ( NYH 3 high ) Patients significant liver failure ( know cirrhosis , Bilirubin level &gt; 2 ) Patients suffer asthma Patients know allergy one study medication Patients know allergy medication nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug group . Patients diabetes ( type 1 2 ) . Patients treat chronically one study medication Patients treat chronically type Beta adrenergic blocker . Patients treat chronically type COX inhibitor . Patients second third degree AV block . Patients sinus bradycardia ( patient heart rate le 50 ) . Patients sick sinus syndrome . Patients Prinzmetal 's angina Patients right side heart failure owe pulmonary hypertension . Patients significant cardiomegaly Patients ( current ) pheochromocytoma Patients chronic Digoxin treatment Patients active peptic disease Patients peripheral vascular disease Patients history concomitant malignant disease type . Patients treat chemotherapy last 10 year reason besides neoadjuvant therapy rectal cancer within last six month . Pregnant woman . Patients participate clinical trial</criteria>
