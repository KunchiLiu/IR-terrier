	<brief_title>Double-blind , Placebo-controlled Study BGC20-1531 Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine headache estimate affect 10-20 % world population list World Health Organisation top 20 cause disable condition , top four neurological disable condition . The common therapy acute migraine non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) triptans . However , many migraine sufferer experience sufficient relief treatment tolerate gastrointestinal , cardiovascular side-effects . Prostaglandin PGE2-induced sensory nerve sensitisation , neuropeptide release cerebral vascular dilatation think underlie migraine pain , particularly via activation EP4 receptor subtype . BGC20-1531 orally available EP4 receptor antagonist inhibit prostaglandin-induced vasodilation cranial blood vessel via selective blockade EP4 receptor reduce inflammation migraine pain . As EP4 receptor discretely localise , overall safety profile EP4 receptor antagonist may improve compare triptans NSAIDs .</detailed_description>
