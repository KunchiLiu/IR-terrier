	<brief_title>Safety Study Evaluate Monoclonal Antibody KW-0761 Subjects With Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/2 , multicenter , open-label , dose escalation clinical study enroll 47 subject previously treat PTCL include CTCL . The study comprise dose escalation phase ( Phase 1 ) preliminary assessment efficacy ( Phase 2 ) . In dose escalation phase , start dose 0.1 mg/kg administer i.v . every week four week , follow 2-week observation period first treatment course . Succeeding dose level include 0.3 1 mg/kg . During first course treatment assessment perform day 29 ( end week 4 ) indicate subject demonstrate overall CR , subject may continue study additional four infusion beyond CR every week infusion schedule . Treatment discontinue order determine duration response . If subject experience PR SD , subject may continue therapy consultation investigator medical monitor every week infusion schedule disease progression occur withdrawal criterion meet .</detailed_description>
