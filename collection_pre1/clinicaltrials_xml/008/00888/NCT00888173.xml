	<brief_title>Brivanib Alaninate Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity brivanib ( brivanib alaninate ) patient recurrent persistent endometrial cancer frequency patient survive progression-free least 6 month initiate therapy objective tumor response.. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression-free survival overall survival . II . To determine nature degree toxicity brivanib assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 3.0 cohort patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether activate mutation fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ( FGFR2 ) associate progression-free survival status &gt; 6 month follow brivanib treatment , objective tumor response follow brivanib treatment , endometrioid histology . II . To explore association select biomarkers response brivanib ( progression-free survival status &gt; 6 month objective tumor response ) , measure clinical outcome ( progression-free survival overall survival ) disease status include histologic cell type : ) mutation FGFR2 phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor normal blood cell ; ii ) immunohistochemical ( IHC ) expression FGFR family ligands , steroid receptor isoforms phosphorylated ( p ) v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( AKT ) FFPE tumor ; iii ) concentration change concentration vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) type IV collagen pre-cycle 1 , pre-cycle 2 and/or pre-cycle 3 plasma . III . To explore relationship among panel biomarkers evaluate cohort : ) mutation FGFR2 PTEN ; ii ) IHC expression FGFR family ligands , steroid receptor isoforms pAKT ; iii ) concentration change concentration VEGF type IV collagen . OUTLINE : Patients receive brivanib alaninate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
