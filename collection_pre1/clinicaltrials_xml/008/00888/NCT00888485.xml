	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Behavioral Intervention Versus Standard Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According recent Cochrane report little evidence far psychological intervention affect total cardiac mortality , reduction number non-fatal recurrent AMI small effect anxiety depression . The subject recruit among consecutive patient discharge Uppsala University Hospital . Inclusion criterion age 75 year young , discharge hospital myocardial infarction ( AMI ) percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , live hospital primary catchment area , refer back general practitioner ( GP ) within one year hospital admission , previously participate similar program , Swedish speaking , willing participate study , accept random group allocation . All subject fulfil inclusion criterion inform study first outpatient visit hospital two week discharge . During visit cardiology outpatient department three month discharge inform subject formally invite participate verbal inform consent obtain , standard requirement time . A write invitation letter baseline examination study mail subject accept invitation eventually include . The recruitment period last may 1996 august 2001 follow-up data collection complete 2008 . At end recruitment period 812 consecutive patient consider inclusion , 302 fulfill inclusion criterion , 148 subject decline participate , case long distance home hospital lack time . The remain 362 subject ( 71.0 % eligible case ) , 85 ( 23 % ) woman , 277 ( 77 % ) men give inform consent participation , 185 ( 51.1 % ) admit AMI , 122 ( 33.7 % ) CABG , 55 ( 15.2 % ) PCI . Seventy-one AMI subject PCI perform course event three CABG . At time study 95 % Swedish population age group Caucasians 90 % native Swedes . The group allocation base SAS `` ranuni '' function provide random number equal probability . The randomization procedure base pre-prepared sealed envelope serial number outside contain paper sheet group allocation front side blind print back eliminate possibility read group allocation sheet outside envelope . The envelope keep sorted ascend serial number order safe . After inclusion subject study monitor ( person access randomization envelop information ) draw next envelope order insert allocation paper sheet study protocol . Of included , 192 allocate behavioral intervention 170 reference group . The included subject inform group allocation baseline measurement.The subject receive invitation letter first ( baseline ) examination first postal questionnaire . The procedure repeat 6th , 12th , 18th 24th month baseline . The examination include anthropometry ( height , weight sagittal diameter ) , blood pressure measurement , blood sample blood lipid . Information marital status , educational level , smoke habit , job status ( include retirement sick leave ) , social background lifestyle factor obtain questionnaire . The Gothenburg Quality Life Instrument , previously validate use many study , use measure quality-of-life aspect . Information medical history baseline measurement obtain baseline questionnaire . The subject ask whether experienced angina pectoris , hypertension , hyperlipemia , congestive heart failure , stroke , peripheral artery disease , diabetes , asthma/congestive pulmonary disease . Responses give `` yes '' `` '' . Hospital admission data obtain link study data set National Hospital Discharge Register National Cause Death Register include non-fatal well fatal event . The record linkage base unique personal identification number ( PIN ) give Swedish resident birth immigration use official register , include population register . The PIN base year , month day birth , four-digit serial number . The second last serial number digit refers subject sex last digit control digit , correctness PIN easily check necessary correct population register . Data National Hospital Discharge Register include hospital admission 1971 31 December 2006 . Survival data obtain Cause Death Registry , include death study population 31 December 2006 . The overall autopsy rate 23 % , autopsy rate among first fatal cardiovascular event outcome trial 50 % . Diagnoses Hospital Discharge Register Cause Death Register cod accord International Classification Diseases ( ICD ) . Cardiovascular disease define ICD-8 code ( 1986 ) ICD-9 code ( 1987-1996 ) 401-459 , ICD-10 code ( 1997 ) I00-I99 . Acute myocardial infarction define ICD-8 code 410 , ICD-9 code 410 , ICD-10 code I21-I22 . Based data number AMIs per subject prior baseline identify . In addition , death irrespective cause , first cardiovascular disease event , fatal non-fatal identify , well first AMI post baseline . Subjects enter intervention program within year index coronary event . The intervention base cognitive behavioral therapy focus stress management aim help CHD patient cope stress reduce experience daily stress , time deadline hostility . For purpose randomized behavioral intervention behavioral intervention ( usual care ) . The intervention , cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , adapt CHD patient , perform group-sessions , include 5-8 participant , separate group woman men , altogether 20 two-hour session per group one year . An experienced psychologist , expert CHD patient CBT , form team train psychologist nurse , together perform session . To secure continuity , group treat group leader . Attendance rate session monitor adherence program excellent . Median attendance rate 85 % , le 5 % attend less 50 % session . The program specific goal 5 key component ; education , self-monitoring , skill training , cognitive restructuring spiritual development .</detailed_description>
