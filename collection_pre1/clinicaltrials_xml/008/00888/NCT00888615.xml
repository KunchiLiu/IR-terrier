	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give elesclomol sodium together paclitaxel work treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , elesclomol sodium paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving elesclomol together paclitaxel may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Elesclomol Sodium Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate antitumor activity elesclomol ( elesclomol sodium ) paclitaxel patient persistent recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer primarily frequency objective tumor response . II . To determine nature degree toxicity elesclomol paclitaxel patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival overall survival patient treat elesclomol paclitaxel . OUTLINE : Patients receive elesclomol sodium intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
