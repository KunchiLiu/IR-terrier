	<brief_summary>Early fixation unstable fracture femur , pelvis , acetabulum reduces complication rate . However , patient multiple injury , optimal treatment skeletal trauma may affect severe injury head , chest , abdomen . The relationship associated injury severity time definitive management unstable fracture well-understood . The practice `` early total care , '' early definitive fracture management , criticize , suggest additional hemorrhage surgery may associate deleterious systemic inflammatory response . The alternative extreme `` damage control orthopedics ( DCO ) '' recently propose mean provide provisional stability major skeletal injury , generally external fixation . It speculate DCO diminish potential systemic compromise . However , need ( definitive ) surgery delay basis , potential additional complication cost associate strategy controversial . The investigator ' goal define injury parameter warrant delay definitive orthopaedic care , determine time interval fracture fixation promote optimal patient outcome . The investigator assess effect fracture fixation head injury , chest injury , abdominal injury , mortality , complication , patient outcome , cost .</brief_summary>
