	<detailed_description>Chronic lateral epicondylitis define presence `` tennis elbow '' 3 month . It common condition general population often result long-term sick-leave . The etiology unknown . A large number treatment try none generally accept . However , Achilles tendinitis new treatment show effective . It consist eccentric exercise , i.e . work stretch rather shorten muscle ( concentric exercise ) . The latter currently common treatment method . This project randomise controlled clinical trial eccentric versus concentric exercise 205 patient chronic lateral epicondylitis . Pain muscle strength record start treatment 1,2,3,6 12 month . Activities daily life ( ADL ) well-being recorded start treatment 3 , 6 12 month . In addition , blood specimen number neural peptide sample . Moreover , involvement peripheral nervous system elbow area examine subsample patient . A biopsy 20 patient per treatment group 20 healthy subject , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan 23 patient perform allow qualitative quantitative examination neural fibre , peptide receptor . The health economy two treatment investigate use data project available register .</detailed_description>
