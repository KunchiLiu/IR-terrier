	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study evaluate safety , immunogenicity optimal timing two injection three dose level tgAAC09 vaccine healthy volunteer . Study volunteer receive two intramuscular injection tgAAC09 placebo Months 0 6 ( group A , C , E G ) Months 0 12 ( group B , D F ) follow total 18 month follow first injection exception group G volunteer follow 12 month first injection ( 6 month second injection ) . This study explore whether boost possible , compare short practical six-month time interval twelve-month time interval .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Study tgAAC09 , HIV Vaccine Adeno-associated Virus ( AAV ) Capsid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design also assess effect presence anti-AAV2 capsid neutralize antibody time vaccination safety immunogenicity tgAAC09 . Since prevalence pre-existing neutralize antibody AAV2 capsid high ( IAVI Targeted Genetics , data file ) , protocol amendment add Group G compose volunteer document pre-existing anti-AAV2 capsid neutralize antibody titer ≤ 1/8 . This assure sufficient number volunteer without antibody useful comparison .</detailed_description>
