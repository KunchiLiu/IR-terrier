	<brief_summary>Aortic aneurysm major disease process affect aorta become relatively common cause death rupture dissection . The common location aneurysm infrarenal abdominal aorta , follow ascend thoracic aorta . Unlike coronary heart disease , incidence abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) United States Europe increase , increase may due high level screen condition alone . Aortic diameter central diagnosis aortic aneurysm . Furthermore , demonstrate non-AAA patient enlarge diameter infrarenal aortic diameter also high risk all-cause mortality . And aortic root dimension associate several coronary artery disease ( CHD ) risk factor measure subclinical disease predictive incident congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , stroke , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) mortality , all-cause mortality , incident MI . Up , limited study epidemiology aortic diameter , especially Chinese population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Epidemiology Aortic Diameter China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study analyze size entire aorta different anatomic level large group Chinese population clinically evident arterial disease cardiovascular risk factor explore risk factor potential alternative pathomechanisms development aortic dilatation . Comprehensive transthoracic M-mode , 2-dimensional , Doppler echocardiographic study perform use commercially available equipment . The aortic dimension assess end-diastole different level : ( 1 ) annulus , ( 2 ) mid-point sinus Valsalva , ( 3 ) sinotubular junction , ( 4 ) ascend aorta level large diameter , ( 5 ) transverse arch , ( 6 ) descend aorta posterior leave atrium , ( 7 ) abdominal aorta distal origin renal artery . The extension dilation define number dilate aortic segment . The relation among aortic dimension clinical characteristic assess multiple regression analysis . The current study determine association risk factor CVD atherosclerosis diseases aortic dimension Chinese patient clinical event atherosclerotic disease risk factor atherosclerotic disease .</detailed_description>
