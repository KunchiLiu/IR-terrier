	<brief_summary>The primary aim propose research examine relationship lifestyle change new dietary , biomedical , cellular parameter among new enrollee enter `` Dr. Dean Ornish Program Reversing Heart Disease program '' 5 select site . Specifically , investigator add assessment emerge cardiac risk factor ( e.g. , high sensitivity C-reactive protein [ hsCRP ] , fibrinogen , lipoprotein ( ) [ Lp ( ) ] , small , dense LDL , apolipoprotein B [ apoB ] , apolipoprotein A-I [ apo A1 ] , apoB/apoA1 ratio , homocysteine [ Hcy ] , B-type natriuretic peptide [ BNP ] , oxidize LDL , fast insulin waist-to-hip ratio [ WHR ] ) , protective pathogenic dietary marker ( e.g. , folate , carotenoid , trans fatty acid ) , measure social support cognitive functioning already exist assessment variable Multisite Cardiac Lifestyle Intervention Program ( MCLIP ) . Hypothesis 1 : Participation lifestyle program associate favorable change standard coronary risk factor quality life , also improvements emerge cardiac risk factor [ hsCRP , Hcy , BNP , fibrinogen , Lp ( ) , small , dense LDL , apoB , apoA1 , oxidize LDL , fast insulin , abdominal obesity ] psychosocial well-being ( i.e. , social support , cognitive functioning ) . Hypothesis 2 : High intake emerge protective dietary factor low intake emerge pathogenic dietary factor associate improvement standard emerge cardiac risk factor ( e.g . Hcy , oxidize LDL ) . Hypothesis 3 : Degree adherence lifestyle change program associate differential improvement standard coronary risk factor , emerge risk factor , cellular aging , psychosocial variable .</brief_summary>
