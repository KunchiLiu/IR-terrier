	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy high dos shorter period time may kill tumor cell few side effect . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether give standard radiation therapy together high-dose cisplatin effective give higher-dose radiation therapy together panitumumab treat patient locally advanced head neck cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial compare two radiation therapy regimens see well work give together cisplatin panitumumab treat patient locally advanced stage III stage IV head neck cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck treated standard fractionation radiotherapy high-dose cisplatin v accelerate fractionation radiotherapy panitumumab . Secondary - To compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - To compare local regional PFS patient treat regimen . - To compare distant metastasis patient treat regimen . - To compare adverse event , include late radiotherapy-related adverse event patient treat regimen . - To compare quality life ( QOL ) patient treat regimen . - To compare swallowing-related QOL patient treat regimen . - To compare economic evaluation ( cost effectiveness analysis cost utility ) , include healthcare utilization indirect cost . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord T category ( T1-3 v T4 ) , nodal status ( N0-1 v N2 v N3 ) , radiotherapy delivery modality ( intensity-modulated [ IMRT ] v 3-D conformal [ 3D CRT ] ) , anatomic location ( hypopharynx v oral cavity v oropharynx v larynx ) , participation optional swallowing impairment substudy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo standard fractionation radiotherapy ( IMRT 3D CRT ) daily , 5 day week , 7 week . Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 22 , 43 radiotherapy . - Arm II : Patients undergo accelerate fractionation radiotherapy ( IMRT 3D CRT ) twice daily , 5 day week , 6 week . Patients receive panitumumab IV 30-90 minute 1 week prior day 15 36 radiotherapy . Treatment arm continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life ( QOL ) ( FACT-H &amp; N ) , swallowing-related QOL ( MDADI , SWAL-QOL ) , swallow function ( FOIS ) , economic evaluation ( Lost Productivity questionnaire ) assess periodically study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically least 5 year .</detailed_description>
