	<detailed_description>Child Conduct problem ( CP ) , find Conduct Disorder ( CD ) Oppositional Defiant Disorder ( ODD ) , common chronic . Although laboratory research study yield promising initial outcome , follow-up effect often study , evaluate , often limited . Maintenance procedure generally administer acute treatment form periodic booster session enhance long-term outcome ( Whisman , 1990 ) . Although conceptualization application maintenance therapy describe frequently adult , limited information regard role maintenance treatment child adolescent psychotherapy ( see Eyeberg , 1998 ) . A study booster treatment report return behavioral improvement ( Baer , Williams , Osnes , &amp; Stokes , 1984 ; McDonald &amp; Budd , 1983 ; Patterson , 1974 ) improvements conduct-disordered child ( Lochman , 1992 ) depress adolescent ( Clark et al. , 1999 ) , suggest potential benefit extend durability treatment effect . What yet know extent patient respond positively booster ( maintenance ) treatment condition administer long-term ( i.e. , three-year ) follow-up , one design reduce recurrence behavioral dysfunction development new form dysfunction adolescence . The justification additional intervention derive initial finding young age sample , , instance , yet traverse period heighten risk delinquency . Literature review highlight importance address least three primary objective understand clinical response long-term adjustment child ODD CD . First , need document empirically long-term effect specialty treatment routine service repeat follow-up assessment effort document maintenance initial treatment gain ( Eyberg et al. , 1998 ) . Our preliminary finding suggest presence similarity differences initial outcome two specialty treatment ( Community vs. Clinic protocol ) support conduct long-term evaluation order determine whether effect continue change . Second , initial finding underscore importance determine extent booster treatment session help promote long-term maintenance produce long-term preventive effect common sequelae ODD CD . Booster treatment may need deflect child unfold trajectory toward increase antisocial behavior multi-system impairment ( Loeber et al. , 1993 ) . Thus , effort promote long-term outcome follow-up population must evaluate effort understand degree show improvement serious clinical dysfunction ( recovery Disruptive Behavior Disorders ( DBD ) ) and/or show reduction development new form dysfunction ( deviant delinquent activity ) may place child at-risk adverse adolescent outcome . The young age patient sample start compete continuation ( 8-16 yr ) may make easy demonstrate preventive effect . Finally , availability modest empirical evidence provide compelling argument evaluate potential predictor above-mentioned long-term follow-up outcome base comprehensive battery psychosocial ( e.g. , child , parent , family adjustment ) biological ( e.g. , testosterone , cortisol ) measure obtain upon study intake treatment termination . Key predictor treatment response include low level child , parent , family dysfunction , barrier treatment , SES ( Kazdin , 1995 ; Kazdin &amp; Wassell , 2000 ) . We also evaluate role contextual life change understand treatment effect follow period . Among important contextual variable evaluate include change parental family functioning , peer relationship , school adjustment . Clearly , variable may influence continue antisocial behavior young age . Thus , examine contextual factor affect well treatment effect hold well real world impact treatment various life change .</detailed_description>
