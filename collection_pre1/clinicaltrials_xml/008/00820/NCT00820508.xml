	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether histone deacetylase inhibitor CHR-2845 tolerate patient haematological disease lymphoid malignancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability CHR-2845 Treat Haematological Diseases Lymphoid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CHR-2845 novel type histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) use cancer , addition broad range anti-proliferative activity transform cell , design increase therapeutic window disease involve cell monocyte-macrophage lineage . There several HDACi 's clinical development one , SAHA ( Vorinostat , Zolinza® ) , recently approve use treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . CHR-2845 cell-permeant ester metabolise give active acid , CHR-2847 , selectively accumulate monocyte macrophage . This result 20-100 fold increase anti-proliferative potency CHR-2845 monocytic non-monocytic tumour cell . This selectivity lead increase therapeutic window haematological malignancy involve cell monocyte lineage ( AML M4 , AML M5 CMML ) . In addition , increase evidence monocyte macrophage associate haematological tumour ( tumour-associated macrophage ( TAMs ) ) involve support growth spread tumour . This clinical trial focus haematological lymphoid malignancy intention evaluate safety tolerability CHR-2845 . Additionally compare response patient monocytes/macrophages important disease driver , response patient . This allow early determination potential improvement therapeutic window afford monocyte/macrophage direct HDACi activity .</detailed_description>
