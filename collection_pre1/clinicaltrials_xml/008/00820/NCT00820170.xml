	<brief_summary>The purpose study find high dose dasatinib safely give patient drug give combination know anticancer drug paclitaxel . Paclitaxel establish anti-cancer drug , use treatment many cancer , approve treatment breast cancer . Dasatinib approve Food Drug Administration use single therapy another kind cancer , use breast cancer patient , combination paclitaxel investigational . In study , test safety dasatinib give different dose level combination paclitaxel . We want find effect , good and/or bad , patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
