	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate non-inferiority Ceramic Metal Total Hip compare TRANSCEND® historical control group patient primary total hip replacement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ceramic Metal Total Hip Replacement System Multi-Center , Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigational device study non-randomized , non-inferiority , multi-center , historically control study . The primary objective evaluate primary endpoint ( 24 month ) primary efficacy safety measure define patient success . The proportion patient success determine whether primary objective met ( study success ) . The investigational device compare historical control comprise patient TRANSCEND® Ceramic Ceramic IDE study . This comparison make use primary secondary measure . However , primary measure use determine study success .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Must 18 year age old time enrollment , 2 . Patient skeletally mature , 3 . Evidence sign date informed consent document indicate patient inform pertinent aspect study , 4 . Patient agree comply protocol , include participate require followup visit investigational site complete study questionnaire , ( i.e . patient 's reasonable driving distance assure study followup completion ) 5 . Investigator determine patient suitable candidate primary total hip replacement , 6 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &lt; 40 , 7 . Preoperative Harris Hip Score ( HHS ) &lt; 70 point calculate Prescreening Qualification Form verify Sponsor , 8 . Have diagnosis degenerative joint disease hip . 1 . Previous total hip replacement , hemiarthroplasty , fusion ipsilateral side , 2 . Patients previous Girdlestone procedure , 3 . Patient known metal allergy component investigational device ( e.g.cobalt , chromium , titanium ceramic ) , 4 . Patient total knee arthroplasty either leg , 5 . Patient vascular insufficiency , muscular atrophy , neuromuscular disease affect limb ( base Investigator 's discretion ) , 6 . Patients congenital disorder deformity adequately address hip replacement sufficient anatomic variance remodel hip joint may place patient risk mechanical failure require structural bone graft ( base Investigator 's discretion ) , 7 . Patients severe instability deformity ligament surround soft tissue would preclude stability implant ( base Investigator 's discretion ) , 8 . Patients Charcot neuropathic arthropathy , neuromuscular disease condition would interfere patient selfassessment pain , function quality life require patient report outcome study ( base Investigator 's discretion ) , 9 . Patient , male postmenopausal female , history metabolic bone disease , define follow : Osteoporosis patient currently take prescription medication increase bonemineral density ( e.g . Fosamax , Didronel ) , Patient previously diagnose metabolic bone disease ( e.g . Paget 's disease osteomalacia ) , Patient metabolic bone disease degree investigator determine THR would contraindicate , 10 . Active malignancy , 11 . Patient active infection ( e.g . hepatitis , AIDS , ARC HIV positive ) systemic site intend surgery , 12 . Clinical diagnosis renal insufficiency renal function abnormal incapable sustain essential bodily function . ( e.g . report KRONOS lab BUN , Creatinine estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) 13 . Currently participate investigational study relate study 's preoperative postoperative care , 14 . Patient mental illness belongs vulnerable population ( e.g. , prisoner severe drug abuser , developmentally disable ) ability provide inform consent comply followup requirement compromise , 15 . Patient pregnant interested become pregnant next 2 year , ( Due require xrays study ) , 16 . Other severe acute chronic medical condition may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
