	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate antitumor activity gemcitabine hydrochloride patient persistent recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma fail high priority treatment protocol . II . To determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
