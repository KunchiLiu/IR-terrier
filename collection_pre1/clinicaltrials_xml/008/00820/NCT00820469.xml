	<brief_summary>Rituximab ( monoclonal antibody raise CD20 ) use treat various immune disorder . In case treatment humoral acute rejection renal transplant , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , vasculitis cryoglobulinemia , rituximab often associate plasma exchange . The pharmacokinetic rituximab affect plasma exchange knowledge poor matter . The aim study explore influence plasma exchange pharmacokinetic rituximab . The result study conclude plasma exchange lead significant decrease plasma concentration rituximab , decrease concentration associate decrease efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Influence Plasma Exchange Pharmacokinetics Rituximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patient enrol : ten patient treat rituximab ten patient treat rituximab plasma exchange . The plasma concentration rituximab efficacy treatment compare two group patient . The enrollment study change treatment patient except blood sampling . Each patient undergo fifteen blood sample start infusion rituximab three month start infusion . For patient undergo plasma exchange , three additional blood sample perform plasma exchange ( start , end one day plasma exchange ) sample plasma exchange keep . The plasma concentration rituximab determine ELISA method ( Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay ) The pharmacokinetic analyse consist determination Area Under Concentration Curve ( AUC ) non compartmental approach . The AUC level compare ( use Student test ) two population patient ( patient treat rituximab , versus patient treat rituximab plasma exchange ) The efficacy treatment evaluate CD19+ B Cell count .</detailed_description>
