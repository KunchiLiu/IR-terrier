	<brief_summary>Testis cancer germ cell frequent cancer young men incidence constant increase many industrialized country , France . An increase risk develop testis cancer describe patient testicular ectopia history testicular cancer history ( controlateral testicular cancer ) recently suggest population hypofertile men alter spermatogenesis . To well understand risk , attempt characterization group patient propose present work . The general objective project characterize morphological molecular marker hypofertility could serve predictive marker testis malignant transformation . In project conduct 3 establishment , investigator propose : - To select population hypofertile patient exhibit compatible clinical morphological character high risk testis tumoral transformation ( secretory azoospermia and/or history testicular ectopia . To determine spermatogenic arrest histological criterion ( score Jonhsen ) . - To study expression four protein family protein suspect involved testis tumorogenesis : Placenta Alkaline Phosphatase ( PLAPE ) , cyclin A1 , VASA connexin ( Cx ) immunohistochemistry real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis real-time analysis . - To establish possible correlation clinical data , spermatogenesis arrest expression biomarkers . These approach would allow identify , population hypofertile patient , subgroup men could develop tumours germ cell , subsequently propose potential biomarkers testis cancer . A clinical observation subgroup also propose .</brief_summary>
