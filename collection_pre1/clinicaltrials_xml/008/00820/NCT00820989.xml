	<detailed_description>The body 's immune response injury infection complex.Immune cell activity , release specific mediator ( protein , genetics ( Deoxyribonucleic acid DNA ) , body 's `` instruction '' make protein ( Ribonucleic Acid RNA ) heart rate variability ( HRV , interval heartbeat ) may affect body 's clinical response stress infection.Endotoxin man-made substance , cause body `` mimic '' sickness ( fever , chill , achiness ) hour . This study design determine whether ( protein , genetics , HRV , etc . ) correlate affect body 's response endotoxin.This enable investigator well understand mechanism involve immune response well potential therapeutic strategy improve outcomes patient .</detailed_description>
