	<brief_title>Myomo e100 NeuroRobotic System Home Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Subjects safely use Myomo e100 NeuroRobotic System home . Primary Outcome Measures : 1 . Safety : 1 . Safety device measure number unanticipated significant device relate adverse event report three week period time . Minor known risk anticipate device use mild muscle soreness fatigue . These consider adverse event . Secondary objectives &amp; outcome measure : A series secondary outcome measure take reason list : â€¢ ROM affect arm take elbow , specifically elbow extension flexion - MMT take bicep tricep muscle - The Chedoke Arm Hand Activity Inventory ( CAHAI ) administer start end study scale measure change functional recovery arm hand . 4 This valid , clinically relevant , responsive functional assessment recover paretic upper limb use bilateral , real-life item . Successful change test define predetermined minimum increase score . This inventory provide two type information : 1st baseline measure severity individual 's impairment functional level . This help identify group stroke patient best suit product home - Additionally , since subject practice specific task Chedoke via repetitive task practice anticipate may change Chedoke score end four week . - Motor Activity Log , semi-structured interview hemiparetic stroke patient administer study start end , well weekly therapist weekly visit ass use paretic arm hand ( amount use [ AOU ] ) quality movement [ QOM ] ) activity daily live . It anticipate subject use device week subject acquaint device task become easy . 5 - Data also capture determine subject able train successfully , doff , operate device via pass competency exam . - Pain shoulder , arm , hand area assess VAS ( 0-10 ) weekly therapist visit . It anticipate increase arm pain beyond normal muscle soreness related increase utilization muscle fiber several month inactivity.6 - Skin area affect arm examine therapist weekly visit note redness skin breakdown . Subject Population : Goal : 6 ( completers ) subject ( Goal 15 enrol accommodate drop out may pass competency exam ) Study Intervention : Initial training : Subjects come clinic period 5 day , three , 2 hour session perform pre test , learn properly , operate device , safely perform series home activity . The teach therapist determine appropriate device setting subject . During first session subject : 1. Review sign inform consent form 2 . Perform pre post test supervision therapist 3 . Receive introduction device include fitting , basic operation safety relate item operate device ( i.e . ) simple flexion extension task . 4 . The subject give user manual MAL . He/she ask fill MAL therapist get idea person daily basis . The subject ask familiar user manual . The subject return 2 day . During second training session subject therapist : 1. Review don doff brace 2. Review turn device 3. Review safety user manual 4 . Take device competency test ensure subject aware safety precaution basic device operation . If fail allow come back Myomo 4 additional visit order provide opportunity pas competency . . 5 . Next therapist program device specifically subject 's level competency . The subject give specific device setting base ability perform task table 1 therapist feel appropriate patient . The goal set provide subject assistance activity . 6 . The subject instruct fill home user log . 7 . The subject provide therapist 's direct number question related operation arise . The third sixth visit utilized subject require instruction review . Initial assessment : On first training session , treat therapist adminster commonly utilized , non invasive , therapeutic outcome measure . These measure include limited : subject 's range motion ( elbow flexion extension ) , manual muscle strength bicep tricep , functional measure : Chedoke Arm Hand Activity Inventory ( CAHAI ) , Motor Activity Log ( MAL ) affect arm pain assessment use Visual Ananlog Scale . ( VAS ) Assigned treatment task : During 15 session , period three week , subject ask perform task home device . The subject ask perform task home approximately one hour session . The frequency session : 5 time per week.. After brief stretch warm period , subject ask perform muscular re-education ROM activity . A sample possible activity put together panel expert therapist find table 1 . Table 1 . # Task Device mode use Number Sets/Reps 1 . Bend straighten elbow seat ( bicep/tricep mode ) 3sets/10 rep 2 . Straighten elbow hold 10 second seat ( tricep mode ) 3 sets/10 rep 3 . Wall Push Ups/Seated stand ( tricep mode ) 3 sets/10 rep 4 . Bicep curl roll pin ( bicep mode ) 3 sets/10 rep 5 . Pick box various height ( bicep mode ) 3 sets/10 rep 6 . Place container table ( focus straighten arm ) ( tricep mode ) 3 stes/10 rep 7 . Steady oneself counter top standing x 20 second ( tricep mode ) 3 sets/10 rep 8 . Carry object hand place place ( bicep mode ) 3 sets/10 rep 9 . Toss ball ( overhand underhand ) ( bicep mode/tricep mode ) 3 sets/10 rep 10 . Pick tooth-brush brush teeth ( bicep mode ) 3 sets/10 rep 11 . Pick glass ( bicep mode ) 3 sets/10 reps The therapist provide patient work sheet list exercise chosen list , mode setting device number set reps perform . Then , session subject ask complete simple log track compliance . If type injury occur use device report subject immediately therapist PI via phone . The incident thoroughly document use guideline set place New England IRB . Weekly therapist visit The patient return research laboratory week Myomo , Inc . The therapist review home use journal subject confirm adverse event report none occur . Final study visit : The last study visit include post evaluation report . The research therapist take ROM , MMT measurement , administer MAL , CAHAI VAS pain . Finally , simple questionnaire ease use device satisfaction use . Any adverse event since last visit record . Physician visit : Any patient report upper limb pain , rash , joint swelling , skin change skin injury condition associate use device directly refer treat physician PI study therapist via phone follow letter . Adverse Event : An Adverse Event define injury sustain subject study visit . Examples occurrence would consider Adverse Events include limit : - Bruising arm soft tissue - Spasms - Shoulder pain All Adverse Events must note CRF mark Adverse Event check box provide detailed description Adverse Event note section form . In addition standard information capture CRF , note Adverse Event include information specific activity ( functional , exercise , otherwise ) subject engage time event , well relevant circumstance surround event . Any adverse event must review entire study staff . The adverse event must report NEIRB timely manner 72 hour event . Serious adverse event must report NEIRB soon possible , 24 hour event .</detailed_description>
