	<brief_title>Cholera Toxin B Subunit ( CTB ) Administered Mucosal Way Healthy Adult Volunteer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The immense majority infection involve mucosal surface gateway pathogenic agent . These mucosal surface mainly represent gastrointestinal , respiratory urogenital tract . These mucosal surface contain highly develop immune system , exploit mucus vaccine approach fight infectious agent upon penetration body . It establish effective infection mucosa , vaccine must stimulate local immune system . This objective reach much efficiently vaccine administer mucosal way ( oral , nasal ) parenteral classical way . Recent work allow develop new non invasive system administration vaccine . It base mucosal administration ( oral , nasal , rectal , vaginal ) comprise combination antigen bound ( either chemically genetic fusion ) non-toxic subunit cholera toxin CTB ( Cholera Toxin B subunit ) . This subunit exceptional affinity GM1 ganglioside express surface nucleated cell . So , mucosal administration ( oral nasal route ) low dose antigen link CTB - Mucosal vector immunomodulatory property - Leads powerful secretor immune response expose mucous As well distant mucous , strong production secretories IgA . The developed method exploration allow characterize cell live ( migrate ) mucous membrane investigate functional phenotypic plan . This research lead range standardize operating procedure , allow evaluate immunogenicity vaccine candidate mucous administration predictive marker type immune response generate . The main objective study analyse healthy voluntary subject systematic immunize answer induce nasal , oral sublingual administration CTB blood sample - lymphoid `` compartment '' accessible man- saliva nasal wash . The immune response administration CTB By sublingual way comparable two way term intensity response , however , different IgA / IgG report . The secondary objective study establish range test predict character intensity response analyze expression B cell certain surface molecule mark future production Antibodies . It regional prospective monocentric study conduct open without direct individual profit . The study conduct 3 year include 24 month recruitment patient follow-up 35 day 6 month operation data .</detailed_description>
