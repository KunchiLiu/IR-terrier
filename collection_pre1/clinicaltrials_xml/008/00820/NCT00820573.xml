	<detailed_description>PRIMARY : In patient type 2 diabetes inadequate glycemic control diet exercise 6 week treatment : Objective : To assess effect co-administration sitagliptin metformin compare placebo hepatic glucose production ( HGP ) . Hypothesis : After 6 week treatment , co-administration sitagliptin metformin provide great reduction hepatic glucose production ( HGP ) compare placebo . SECONDARY : In patient type 2 diabetes inadequate glycemic control diet exercise 6 week treatment : 1 . Objective : To assess effect co-administration sitagliptin metformin compare placebo post-meal glucose meal tolerance test ( MTT ) . Hypothesis : After 6 week treatment co-administration sitagliptin metformin provide great reduction total glucose AUC ( 0-6 hr ) MTT compare placebo . 2 . Objective : To assess effect co-administration sitagliptin metformin compare placebo fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) . Hypothesis : After 6 week treatment co-administration sitagliptin metformin provide great reduction FPG compare placebo . 3 . Objective : To assess effect sitagliptin alone compare placebo HGP . Hypothesis : After 6 week treatment , sitagliptin alone provide great reduction HGP compare placebo EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : ( ) Objective : 6 week treatment , assess effect co-administration sitagliptin metformin compare placebo : 1. active inactive incretin concentration ( fast post-meal GLP-1 fast post-meal GIP ) . 2. glucagon concentration ( fast post-meal ) . 3. parameter insulin secretion insulin sensitivity . 4. splanchnic glucose uptake . ( ii ) Objective : 6 week treatment , assess effect co-administration sitagliptin metformin compare treatment sitagliptin alone metformin alone : 5. glucose concentration ( fast total glucose AUC [ 0-6 hr ] ) . 6. active inactive incretin concentration ( fast post-meal GLP-1 fast post-meal GIP ) . 7. glucagon concentration ( fast post-meal ) . 8. parameter insulin secretion insulin sensitivity . 9 . HGP . 10. splanchnic glucose uptake . ( iii ) Objective : 6 week treatment , assess effect sitagliptin alone metformin alone compare placebo : 11. glucose concentration ( fast total glucose AUC [ 0-6 hr ] ) . 12. active inactive incretin concentration ( fast post-meal GLP-1 fast post-meal GIP ) . 13. glucagon concentration ( fast post-meal ) . 14. parameter insulin secretion insulin sensitivity . 15 . HGP . 16. splanchnic glucose uptake .</detailed_description>
