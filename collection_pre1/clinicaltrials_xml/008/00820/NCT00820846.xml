	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Prime-Boost Vaccine Regimen HIV-Uninfected Vaccine-Naive Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some first HIV vaccine design trigger neutralize antibody responses way prevent HIV infection . Unfortunately , first version vaccine able achieve desire response . An alternative strategy antibody approach stimulation HIV-specific CD8 T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses . CTL responses previously demonstrate play important role control simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) , HIV equivalent see rhesus macaque monkey . Additionally , study suggest CTLs play important role viral control chronic infection . Based information , several group shift focus development CTL-based vaccine , enter advanced clinical trial . A DNA/rMVA vaccine strategy structure bring T-cell antibody response . The primary vaccination DNA base express HIV proteins way produce HIV-focused immune response . An rMVA vaccine strategy express HIV MVA proteins may amplify focused response DNA vaccination . Participants study receive either combined DNA/rMVA vaccine strategy , receive type vaccine ; rMVA vaccine strategy , receive rMVA vaccine ; placebo . The DNA rMVA physically two different vaccination give separate time , DNA/rMVA group , use together make one preventive regimen . Both vaccine component express noninfectious virus-like particle . This study multicenter , randomize study conduct two part comprise five group . In group , participant receive four injection . In Part A , Groups 1 2 compare . In Group 1 , participant receive two shot DNA vaccine two shot rMVA vaccine . In Group 2 , participant receive four placebo injection . In Part B , Groups 3 , 4 , 5 compare . In Group 3 , combination vaccine strategy use ; Group 4 , single-vaccine strategy three injection rMVA vaccine one injection placebo give ; Group 5 , participant receive four placebo injection . The study last total 12 month participant , include enrollment follow-up .</detailed_description>
