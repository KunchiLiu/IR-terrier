	<detailed_description>Rationale : Despite recent progress gene-expression profiling study , underlie biology various pattern metastasis observe different tumour type remain unclear . The detection characterization circulate tumour cell cancer patient provide important new information progression metastatic event . This information important implication cancer prognosis therapy . This open label , multicenter phase II study design evaluate overall tumour response rate advance breast cancer patient HER-2 non amplify primary tumour positive HER-2 EGFR circulate tumour cell treat dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor GW572016 ( Lapatinib ) . The patient allocate one follow two stratum : Stratum 1 ) Italian study group : Advanced breast cancer patient HER-2 non-amplified primary tumour HER-2 positive circulate tumour cell Stratum 2 ) UK study group : Advanced breast cancer patient HER-2 non-amplified primary tumour EGFR positive circulate tumour cell . All patient treat GW572016 ( Lapatinib ) target HER-2 EGFR receptor . A subgroup patient enrol stratum 2 ask participate additional sub-study use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) quantify potential early response lapatinib treatment . Study Design : This study multicenter open-label , phase II study evaluate efficacy safety daily dose Lapatinib advance breast cancer patient HER-2 non amplify primary tumour positive HER-2 EGFR circulate tumour cell . Patients enrol study treat oral Lapatinib dose 1,500 mg daily day 1 28 every 4 week ( q 4 week ) . Patients carefully instruct drug administration far Lapatinib oral intake concern . A daily dose Lapatinib six 250 mg tablet take approximately time day . Lapatinib must take either least 1 hour meal . Dose adjustment , modification delay permit accord procedure describe protocol . Initially 16 patient stratum treat ; 1 3 response observe , 15 additional patient treat , total 62 subject 31 subject stratum .</detailed_description>
