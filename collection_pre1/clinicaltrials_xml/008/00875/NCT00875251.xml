	<brief_summary>Growth traditionally use prognostic measure admission neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . Quality neonatal intensive care one factor determine health quality life survive , principal objective increase disability-free survival . Nowadays , research show u preterm baby present different body composition achieve term age compare baby birth term condition could put baby risk metabolic syndrome early adult age . The majority infant bear 24 29 week gestational age fail achieve mean birth weight fetuses gestational age , many weigh 10th percentile hospital discharge . The focus study growth body composition low birth weight infant grow extrauterine environment . The central question , reach correspond term weight , body composition newborn grow outside uterus different infant grow intrauterine environment ? The investigator also try validate 3 different method research body composition : DXA , air-displacement plethysmography electric bioimpedance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES GENERAL : Evaluate growth body composition VLBW infants upon reach corresponding term gestational age ( GA ) weight . SPECIFIC : A ) Evaluate longitudinal growth body composition VLBW infant first week life correspond term GA weight . B ) Relate weight loss first week life weight percentage total body water correspond term GA weight . C ) Compare body composition VLBW newborns grow extrauterine environment upon reach corresponding term GA weight body composition term newborn , use 3 method ( DEXA , air-displacement plethysmography , electric bioimpedance ) D ) Adjust predictive model body weight estimate use parameter furnish multi-frequency single-frequency electric bioimpedance anthropometry , measurement provide DEXA plethysmography gold standard . E ) Relate body weight composition correspond term GA neonatal morbidity . METHODOLOGY Study characteristics A mixed longitudinal study conduct . The newborn include different gestational age remain study reach corresponding term gestational age weight ( 2,800g 3,200g ) . Study site The study perform Fernandes Figueira Institute ( IFF ) , unit Oswaldo Cruz Foundation Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . Study population The study population consist premature newborn gestational age le 32 week and/or intrauterine growth restriction . Data collect begin birth hospitalization outpatient follow-up hospital discharge . Definitions establish criterion Evaluation adequacy weight relation gestational age base curve Alexander et al . ( 1996 ) , define SGA newborn birth weight 10th percentile relation gestational age ; AGA define 10th 90th percentile ; large gestational age ( LGA ) 90th percentile . Intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) This study define IUGR Z-score newborn 's birth weight gestational age less equal -2 . The study use sex-specific Canadian reference birth weight gestational age , use 3rd , 5th , 10th , 50th ( mean ) , 90th , 95th , 97th percentile 22 43 complete week standard deviation ( Kramer et al , 2001 ) . Z-score . The measurement use reference obtain Z-score Fenton et al . Gestational age Gestational age base mother 's date last menstrual period . In case doubt , confirmation obtain date gestational age estimate first-trimester ultrasound , necessary , Ballard method ( Ballard et al , 1991 ) , estimate gestational age base newborn 's somatic characteristic neurological evaluation . Corrected gestational age After obtain gestational age birth , age correct course study add week post-natal life . Each age week consider variation zero six day . Morbidities - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia define newborn use oxygen therapy 36 week correct gestational age . - Late-onset sepsis define positive blood CSF culture presence clinical sign sepsis 72 hour life clinical infection negative culture 72 hour life newborn receive 5 day antibiotic therapy . - Necrotizing enterocolitis consider classified stage II A high accord modify Bell criterion ( Walsh &amp; Kleigman , 1986 ) . - Severe intraventricular hemorrhage define grade 3 4 accord scale describe Papile et al ( 1978 ) . Measurements body weight , length , foot size , triceps skinfold , mid-arm circumference , total body water take 5 moment premature infant : first 24 hour life , 7th day life recover birth weight , term ( GA ≥ 37 &lt; 42 week ) , weight 2,800 3,200g . The two latter measurement may take hospital discharge , outpatient follow-up . These variable evaluate first 24 hour life term newborn weight 2,800g 3,200g . Anthropometric Evaluation Measurements perform researcher , follow previous training , consider mean three measurement . The newborn measure unclothed keep previously prescribe heating , except weigh . Weight Weight measure Filizola brand digital scale accurate 5 gram , tar weigh . Length Length measure use anthropometric ruler design manufactured precision workshop University São Paulo Ribeirão Preto , São Paulo State . The newborn place supine position flat surface stiff possible , adjust child 's head medial position ruler 's fixed surface . Holding child position knee extend assistant , ruler 's mobile extremity move ruler perfectly adjust sol newborn 's foot . Head circumference Head circumference measure use non-elastic tape measure mark millimeter . The tape measure adjust newborn 's head , pass front across supra-orbital region , eyebrows , behind across occipital bulge , record large circumference obtain . Foot size The measurement take caliper mark millimeter , adjust large diameter infant 's right foot . Triceps Skinfold ( TSF ) Triceps skinfold measurement take Harpenden type caliper , measure millimeter , accurate 0.1mm . This measurement always take right arm , midpoint acromion olecranon , immediately skin hollow , arm extend . The measurement record obtain stabilize caliper pointer ( approximately 60 second ) . Mid-arm circumference ( MAC ) This circumference obtain , always leave arm , midpoint acromion olecranon , skin hollow , arm extend hand prone position , non-elastic millimeter tape measure ( Sasanow et al , 1986 ) . The location triceps skinfold . Mid-arm muscle circumference ( MAMC ) This parameter aim measure arm 's muscle size thus indirectly indicate newborn 's nutritional status extrauterine growth . It use 2 combined measurement , triceps skinfold mid-arm circumference . Body composition evaluation Body composition evaluate use 3 method available Fernandes Figueira Institute ( BIA , plethysmography , DEXA ) . The study measure total body water , lean mass , body fat . Bioimpedance measurement make RJL System ( Quantum BIA 101Q equipment ) Hydra multi-frequency equipment ( Xitron technology ) . Both piece equipment inexpensive test non-invasive perform bedside . However , neither validate measure body fat newborns infant ( first year life ) . We use quadripolar electrode preferably right hand foot . The electrode cut ± 1 cm strip attach hand foot minimum distance 3 cm ( wrist ankle flexure immediately base finger toe ) . The anatomical criterion position electrode choose base fact study focus human being growth process , double triple birth weight study period . The newborn measure feeding , prone position , wear dry disposable diaper . The arm keep away trunk leg touch . The infant comfortable quiet , measurement record variation great ± 1 point . The difference resistance value obtain distal position ( right hand right foot , right hand leave foot , leave hand leave foot , leave hand right foot ) significant , electrodes thus use position . The equation use calculate total body water ( TBW ) propose validate Tang Wing et al 1997 , use 2 anthropometric measurement ( weight foot length ) resistance ( R ) measure electric bioimpedance technique . Body fat percentage total body composition measure air-displacement plethysmography PEA POD System iDEXA equipment , use software small animal . Based measurement real body fat , predictive model adjust estimate body fat use parameter obtain bioimpedance ( resistance reactance ) anthropometry ( Hull et al , 2008 , Roggero et al , 2008 , Ellis et al , 2008 , Ma et al , 2008 ) . Statistical analysis Data analysis use Epi Info ( Epi - 6.04 ) Centers Disease Control ( CDC - Atlanta , USA ) . We use analysis variance continuous variable normal distribution non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test others analyze difference group . The chi-square test use categorical variable calculate difference proportion . A frequency table use categorical variable mean median standard deviation continuous variable . The model estimate body fat base bioimpedance measurement fit use multiple linear regression model .</detailed_description>
