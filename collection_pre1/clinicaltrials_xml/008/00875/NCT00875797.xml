	<brief_summary>Glutamine major fuel intestinal tract immune cell therefore affect intestinal permeability ( IP ) infection rate critically ill patient . The preferential route glutamine supplementation critically ill patient still remain open . Therefore researcher investigate IP , infection rate treatment outcome patient supplement either parenteral enteral glutamine . A prospective randomize single blind study perform mechanically ventilate . Patients randomly assign either parenteral ( group P ) enteral ( group E ) glutamine supplement group . Early enteral feeding start group . Patients are/will treat glutamine five day . IP measure use lactulose/mannitol test ( L/M ) fourth day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enteral Versus Parenteral Glutamine Supplement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient fulfil described criterion randomly assign group P E use sequentially numbered container conceal randomization . Those group P receive continuous infusion parenteral glutamine dipeptide supplement ( Dipeptiven 100ml , Fresenius Kabi ) feed enterally standard commercial enteral polymeric diet without add glutamine ( Ensure , Abbott Ross ) . The patient group E receive enteral glutamine supplement continuous administration standard commercial enteral diet supplement glutamine ( Alitraq , Abbott Ross ) . The dose enteral glutamine , form free acid diet , depend volume enteral food . Both group patient treat glutamine supplement five day . The therapeutic procedure differ group . All patient continuous gastric feed 20 hour daily , start 20ml/hour . The enteral nutrition start 24 hour follow admission . The gastric residual measure three time daily , less 250ml , feed volume gradually increase 100ml/hour . If need day two onwards , patient three group receive additional parenteral amino acid glucose solution reach goal 20kcal/kg/day 0.15g nitrogen/kg/day . Intestinal permeability ( IP ) measure day 4 use lactulose/mannitol ( L/M ) test . For study purpose , patient fast 6 hour test . The test perform 5g mannitol ( M ) 10g lactulose ( L ) mix 100ml water . The mixture give bolus via nasogastric tube . At time , 4ml 20 % chlorhexidine add empty urine bag . The urine collect bag six hour . Then 5ml urine sample bag store -20ËšC analysis . Two hour test enteral feed via nasogastric tube start . Urinary L M determine simultaneously thin-layer chromatography14 , new method laboratory lactulose mannitol determination . The method enable determination lactulose mannitol urine amino HPTLC plate densitometric quantification lactulose use fluorescence mode , mannitol use absorption mode detection AgNO3 reagent . The new method result short analysis time , low consumption chemical HPTLC plat , increased sensitivity ( low limit detection ) few problem interfere compound determination lactulose previously use two separate method determination analytes.14 The separation quantification use method highly reproducible , yield standard error le 2.5 % retention time less 3.5 % quantitation.15,16 The investigator laboratory blind study group . L/M index calculate urinary concentration ( c ) L M use follow formula : L/M = c L / ( c M x 2 ) . L/M test perform begin study unstable trauma septic patient also include study , patient , urine collection difficult perform . Nosocomial infection record entire ICU stay recommend Centre Disease Control Atlanta.17,18 Nosocomial pneumonia diagnose Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia Risk Index 6 more.19 The infection present upon admission diagnose within first two day ICU treatment mark acquire ICU admission . All diagnosed infection treat accord result microbiological test and/or accord infection control guideline . Acute inflammatory response measure C-reactive protein ( CRP ) level . The blood sample determination obtain baseline end study . Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation II ( APACHE II ) score calculate upon admission . Each patient 's ICU hospital length stay ( LOS ) six month survival record . All participant blind intervention . The ICU-staff blind group assignment , take part outcome assessment hand , outcome assessor laboratory personnel blind group assignment .</detailed_description>
