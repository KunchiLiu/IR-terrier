	<brief_summary>Neck dissection main technique use head neck surgeon treat know suspected metastatic cancer neck . The traditional radical neck dissection effective treating metastatic cancer neck however downside technique significant morbidity . Since early 1960 's several propose technique treat metastatic head neck cancer involve preserve important anatomical structure neck . The disadvantage technique require meticulous dissection lead bleed increase operative time . One particular tool propose surgical subspecialties , include head neck surgery , harmonic scalpel . Using tool , tissue dissection vessel occlusion time occur reduce thermal damage surround tissue compare traditional cautery . In study , purpose determine harmonic scalpel lead decrease blood loss operative time patient undergo modified radical neck dissection compare electrocautery . Hypothesis : Use harmonic scalpel surgical adjunct reduce operative time neck dissection reduce intraoperative blood loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Harmonic Scalpel Neck Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients refer either clinic Dr. Joseph Dort Dr. Wayne Matthews deem benefit modified radical neck dissection alone part treatment head neck cancer give opportunity subject study . Once informed consent surgery study obtain , lead author contact randomization occur use computer generate block-randomization allocation . The neck dissection carry operating room use either electrocautery ( control group ) harmonic scalpel ( experimental group ) . The primary outcome , blood loss ( mLs ) operative time ( minute ) assess time surgery . The blood loss milliliter calculate use suction canister output , weight sponge irrigation use . The operative time minute calculate begin actual neck dissection completion neck dissection define removal surgical specimen hemostasis surgical field . Intraoperative complication , namely vascular , nerve damage lymphatic damage assess time surgery . Post-operative complication , early late assess surgery use Clavien post-operative complication scale . In addition , length time operative drain leave neck measure drain remove 24 hour drain output le 20 ml . Patients follow 2 week hospital discharge surgeon 's clinic Tom Baker Cancer Centre .</detailed_description>
