	<brief_title>PRESTIGE Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Degenerative cervical disc disease associate high burden patient society . If conservative treatment option fail , surgical intervention last treatment option . Symptomatic disc degeneration lead neck pain , radiate scapula arm , dumbness tingling , sometimes grasp walk difficulty . At advanced stage , muscle weakness observe nerve territory . The quality life functionality patient therapy-resistant ( conservatively treat ) severe degeneration disc greatly impaired , suffer intense pain thus disability . Patients work age significantly impact symptom old patient . They longer able fully participate everyday activity . Cervical neck pain result degenerative disc disease associate major economic burden payer . Traditional cervical surgical decompression fusion currently common treatment option . Despite good treatment success rate , fusion associate negative impact normal kinematics spine , long recuperation time long absence work . Prestige artificial disc replacement alternative treatment option . The PRESTIGE Observational Study intend collect information Quality Life ( QoL ) prior PRESTIGE® Cervical Disc surgery ; data pain prior participation study , drug regiment X-ray evaluation throughout course study obtain . In addition adverse event economic data document .</detailed_description>
