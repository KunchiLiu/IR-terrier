	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine polymorphisms gene ( e.g. , CYBA , RAC2 , NCF4 , MRP1 , MRP2 , GTSP CBR3 ) woman breast cancer treat doxorubicin hydrochloride increase relative risk develop ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity . ( Primary study ) - To determine whether pre-treatment level biomarkers ( e.g. , neuregulin , IGF-1 , cardiotrophin-1 , IL-6 , VEGF , hepatocyte growth factor , heparin bind EGF ) patient , correlate relative risk develop ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity regimen . ( Primary study ) - To determine whether decreased heart rate variability increase plasma level norepinephrine 3 week completion regimen correlate relative risk develop ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity patient . ( Primary study ) - To determine whether decrease endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) number 3 week completion regimen detect , whether decrease EPC number correlate ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity . ( Primary study ) - To determine whether baseline physical fitness level patient , assess questionnaire 6 minute walk distance , correlate relative risk develop ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity regimen . ( Primary study ) - To determine whether activity level patient treatment , assess questionnaire , correlate relative risk develop ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity regimen . ( Primary study ) - To determine whether drop functional capacity patient , measure 6 minute walk distance end treatment regimen , correlate ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity . ( Primary study ) - To determine whether MRI detect change diastolic heart function patient 48 hour administration regimen . ( Sub-study A ) - To determine great decrease diastolic dysfunction patient 48 hour predictive great decrease systolic function 3 week treatment regimen . ( Sub-study A ) - To determine whether level certain biomarkers cardiac myocyte damage , B-type natriuretic peptide sarcomere protein troponin T 48 hour initial exposure drug correlate relative risk develop ≥ NCI grade1 cardiotoxicity . ( Sub-study A ) - To determine whether trastuzumab give concurrently doxorubicin hydrochloride decrease heart rate variability increase plasma level norepinephrine patient , , whether change correlate relative risk develop NCI grade ≥ 1 cardiotoxicity . ( Sub-study B ) - To determine whether EPC number obtain patient treat trastuzumab decrease migration microvascular structure ex vivo assay whether change correlate ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity . ( Sub-study B ) - To determine whether level certain biomarkers patient , include neuregulin , IGF-1 , cardiotrophin-1 , IL-6 , VEGF , hepatocyte growth factor heparin bind EGF , change exposure trastuzumab . ( Sub-study B ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Primary study : Patients make initial visit ( begin doxorubicin hydrochloride treatment ) visit 3 week 4th course doxorubicin hydrochloride ( approximately 12 week initial visit ) . During visit , blood sample also collect measure serum level neuregulin-1 , IGF-1 , cardiotropin-1 , IL-6 , VEGF , hepatocyte growth factor , plasma norepinephrine endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) . Heart-rate variability ( HRV ) measure , necessary , transthoracic echocardiogram perform . Patients complete baseline health activity level questionnaire suitable patient complete 6-minute walk test . Patients undergo blood collection genotype analysis single nucleotide polymorphism sit initial visit . Patients complete questionnaire assess physical activity begin 2nd , 3rd , 4th course chemotherapy . - Sub-study A ( MRI ) * : In addition assessment perform primary study , patient undergo extra test . During initial visit , patient additional blood sample collect initial visit measurement B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) troponin T undergo cardiac MRI . Approximately 48 hour first dose doxorubicin hydrochloride , patient undergo additional visit , blood sample collect BNP troponin T cardiac MRI perform . NOTE : *Patients enroll sub-study A must also enrol primary study . - Sub-study B ( trastuzumab ) * : In addition assessment perform primary study , patient undergo extra test . Patients undergo additional visit third treatment trastuzumab ( approximately 6 month first dose doxorubicin hydrochloride ) , patient blood sample collect analyzed Primary study visit 2 . HRV measure , necessary , transthoracic echocardiogram perform . NOTE : *Patients enroll sub-study B must also enrol primary study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
