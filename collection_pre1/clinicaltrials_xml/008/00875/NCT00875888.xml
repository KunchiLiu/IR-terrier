	<brief_summary>This study assess influence High Cut-Off ( HCO ) CVVHD treatment disease progression septic patient . The primary aim study evaluate whether HCO CVVHD lead significant improvement hemodynamic status ( mean arterial pressure , vasopressor requirement ) septic patient comparison CVVHD treatment conventional high-flux filter . For HCO-group investigator expect 50 % low dosage vasopressor need maintain adequate organ perfusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Cut-Off Continuous Veno-venous Hemodialysis ( CVVHD ) Patients Treated Acute Renal Failure After Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) /Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis devastate disorder result complex host response insult infection . Despite advance intensive care technology sepsis remain important life-threatening problem . Sepsis common cause death intensive care unit . Local systemic release bacteria-derived compound , lead production proinflammatory cytokine , induce systemic inflammatory reaction septic patient . Continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) hemodialysis ( CVVHD ) , hemofiltration ( CVVH ) hemodiafiltration ( CVVHDF ) conventional high-flux membrane allow control fluid electrolyte balance , improve hemodynamic status patient . However , conventional high flux membrane limit permeability sepsis-associated mediator molecular weight range 15.000 60.000 Da . A promising approach enhance mediator removal use membrane large pore permeability characteristic currently use CRRT . For purpose High Cut-Off ( HCO ) membrane develop manufactured Gambro Research.After demonstrate safety well cytokine removal effectiveness clinical pilot study study assess influence HCO treatment disease progression septic patient .</detailed_description>
