	<brief_summary>In many case , exist lock bolt screw intramedullary nail provide sufficient stability . The play screw nail result loss reduction instability due interfragmentary movement result malunions nonunions . Therefore , Angular Stable Locking System Intramedullary Nails ( ASLS ) develop enhance axial angular fracture stability . ASLS provide angular-stable fixation nail screw resorbable sleeve use dowel nail lock hole . Preliminary result pre-study show trend towards reduce time pain-free full weight bear patient treat ASLS . This hypothesis test present randomize control study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim present study evaluate effectiveness Angular Stable Locking System ( ASLS ) patient distal tibial fracture treat Expert Tibial Nails ( ETN ) . In many case , exist lock bolt screw intramedullary nail provide sufficient stability . The play screw nail result loss reduction instability due interfragmentary movement result malunions nonunions . Therefore , Angular Stable Locking System Intramedullary Nails ( ASLS ) develop enhance axial angular fracture stability . ASLS provide angular-stable fixation nail screw resorbable sleeve use dowel nail lock hole . Preliminary result pre-study show trend towards reduce time pain-free full weight bear patient treat ASLS . This hypothesis test present randomize control study .</detailed_description>
