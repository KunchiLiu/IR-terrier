	<detailed_description>Objectives : To meet VA-wide need early diagnosis mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) return soldier , April 2007 VA establish policy procedure screen evaluation possible TBI OEF OIF veteran . Although screen process effect year , validity , reliability , false positive rate , false negative rate TBI Clinical Reminder unknown . The purpose research develop gold standard ass validity/reliability TBI Clinical Reminder screen . Specific short-term objective study include : 1 . Operationalize gold standard TBI identification , use national panel expert . 2 . Identify patient characteristic level Polytrauma care predict delay failure complete TBI Clinical Reminder screen 3 . Using gold standard , evaluate validity ( sensitivity specificity ) reliability current TBI Clinical Reminder Screen . 4 . Identify approach improve TBI Clinical Reminder screen protocol , include screen instrument process . Research Design : Methodologies study include prospective retrospective approach . Experts convene Tampa operationalize gold standard TBI identification ( Objective 1 ) . Retrospective , population-based cohort analysis extant database provide insight current practice finding address Objective 2 . The gold standard develop Objective1 implement small time-limited prospective cohort psychometric analysis TBI screen conduct ( Objective 3 ) . Findings analyse help identify potential improvement TBI Screening process address Objective 4 . Collaboration : This study responsive RFP ( # 410127 , TBI Screen , 8/7/2008 ) . The Tampa HSR &amp; D REAP partner investigator Boston VAMC ; Tampa investigator take lead psychometric evaluation TBI screen , Boston investigator use cohort evaluate Second Level TBI Evaluation . Researchers sit co-investigators proposal enhance collaboration linkage finding . Anticipated Impact : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , particularly mild TBI , say `` signature injury '' current conflict . These injury currently focus post-deployment assessment treatment within VA likely continue focus treatment many year come . To ensure OEF/OIF veteran TBI identify treat , VA TBI Clinical Reminder institute form four-item screening tool use VA . While VA-TBI screen reminder roll April 2 , 2007 , utility psychometric property screen unknown . The propose project address gap operationalizing gold standard TBI identification use gold standard evaluate reliability validity current TBI screen . By complete project , propose identify specific improvement TBI protocol instrument screen process .</detailed_description>
