	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) common condition lead daytime sleepiness loss vigilance , addition , increase risk cardiovascular event . The effective treatment consist ventilation mask continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , prevent collapse upper airway . However degree collapsibility pharynx may vary relation position , sleep stage , alcohol sedative consumption . Thus , CPAP treatment ( invented 1981 ) evolve development sophisticated equipment permit adapt variation pressure level ( autoCPAP ) objective adjust pressure avoid airways obstruction minimal pressure . Different model autoCPAP function different signal event detection algorithm different mode reaction event . These machine market CE certification , guarantee electrical security , date , requirement pre-marketing clinical validation . Nonetheless inadequate treatment may leave patient risk accident cardiovascular event . These machine bench test use test equipment measure accuracy response simulate event , test equipment simulate diversity clinical situation , residual level microarousals may persist . Thus bench test need supplement clinical study . The investigator objective test efficacy machine residual sleep-related event one night autotitration polysomnography . We develop prospective , multicentre , non randomise study autotitration polysomnography one night . These clinical result compare result bench test order evaluate pertinence bench test eventual utility simplify clinical evaluation . The perspective develop reliable test protocol may eventually play role certification machine .</brief_summary>
