	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood patient breast cancer laboratory may help doctor identify learn biomarkers relate tamoxifen resistance . PURPOSE : This laboratory study look tamoxifen resistance woman stage I , stage II , stage IIIA , stage IIIB breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tamoxifen Resistance Women With Stage I , Stage II , Stage IIIA , Stage IIIB Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Identify woman resistant tamoxifen citrate drug treatment breast cancer test plasma presence protein ( e.g. , macrophage migration inhibition factor ) encode resistance-inducing gene ( RIGs ) . - Provide retrospective data predictive value RIGs serve basis prospective clinical trial gene predictor drug resistance . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord response tamoxifen citrate ( TAM ) therapy ( resistant group [ i.e. , develop recurrent breast cancer treat TAM ] v conditionally sensitive group [ i.e. , disease-free survival 3 year initial diagnosis treat TAM ] ) . Patients undergo blood collection baseline , within 3 week initiation TAM therapy , every 6 month 3 year relapse , whichever come first . Samples analyze enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay expression protein biomarkers ( i.e. , kallikrein gene 10 , macrophage migration inhibition factor , prolyl carboxypeptidase , queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase , kinesin ) encode resistance-inducing gene . An additional blood sample obtain patient time relapse , available . Patients also undergo assessment medical history , personal habit , characteristic breast cancer ( e.g. , tumor histology , stage , grade ) baseline .</detailed_description>
