	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . PURPOSE : This laboratory study look biomarkers store tumor sample young patient liver cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Stored Tumor Samples From Younger Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To characterize , molecular level , archive sample tissue young patient fibrolamellar carcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma non-cirrhotic liver match age sex . - To perform genomic analysis tissue sample use array comparative genomic hybridization . - To perform targeted gene mutation analysis sample PCR . - To perform proteomic profile fix tissue sample various proteomic method , include IHC mass spectrometry . - To look association molecular aberration clinicopathologic feature sample . OUTLINE : Archived tissue sample collect pathology department Vanderbilt University Medical Center Mayo Clinic Rochester , Minnesota . Tissue sample analyze genomic analysis use array comparative genomic hybridization , target gene mutation analysis PCR , proteomic profiling fix tissue use various proteomic method , include IHC mass spectrometry . Samples also examine association molecular aberration clinicopathologic feature find disease . Clinical patient data ( i.e. , age , sex , race , date diagnosis , risk factor , histology , surgical staging , follow-ups , date death , adjuvant therapy ) also collect .</detailed_description>
