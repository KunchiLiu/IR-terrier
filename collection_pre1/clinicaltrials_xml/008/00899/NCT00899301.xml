	<brief_title>Collecting Storing Tissue Samples From Women With Without Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To create database include environmental , demographic , phenotypic , clinical , pathologic , genetic , prognostic factor large cohort woman different stage breast cancer . - To create tissue repository contain DNA , RNA , protein tumor tissue normal tissue , peripheral blood lymphocyte , plasma link frozen and/or paraffin-embedded pathology specimen . OUTLINE : Patients undergo tumor tissue normal tissue sample collection time medically indicate surgery biopsy . Archival tissue may also collect . Patients normal volunteer also undergo blood urine sample collection . A repository tissue , blood , urine sample establish facilitate current future research study learn biologic feature breast cancer development progression . Research study may include molecular pathology study gene protein expression study . Patients ' medical record review approximately 5 year determine test result associate health status . Patients receive result individual testing .</detailed_description>
