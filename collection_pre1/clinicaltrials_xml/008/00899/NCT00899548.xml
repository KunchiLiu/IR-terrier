	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood patient cancer healthy participant laboratory may help doctor learn change may occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict well patient respond systemic therapy . PURPOSE : This laboratory study look DNA predict response systemic therapy woman metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DNA Predicting Response After Systemic Therapy Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Identify panel methylated gene marker serum woman metastatic breast cancer significantly different observe healthy participant . - Assess change panel methylated gene marker baseline , 3-4 week , 9-12 week systemic therapy patient metastatic breast cancer . - Determine potential effect common exposure ( i.e. , alcohol , smoking , medication , dietary factor ) pattern serum methylation patient metastatic breast cancer healthy participant . - Develop predictive model use DNA methylation profile serum predict clinical outcome individual patient metastatic disease . Secondary - Correlate circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) clinical outcome patient metastatic breast cancer . - Correlate CTCs serum methylation patient . - Determine addition CTCs serum methylation result improve predictive model . OUTLINE : This prospective , multicenter study . Patients healthy participant fill health assessment questionnaires baseline , week 3-4 , week 9-12 . Patients undergo blood collection methylated marker analysis baseline , week 3-4 , week 9-12 circulate tumor cell level baseline week 3-4 . Healthy participant undergo blood collection methylated marker analysis baseline . An additional cohort healthy participant undergo follow-up blood collection ≥ 1 week baseline . DNA methylation measure quantitative multiplex methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction ( QM-MSP ) assay . After completion study procedure , patient follow every 3-4 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 150 patient 150 healthy participant accrue study .</detailed_description>
