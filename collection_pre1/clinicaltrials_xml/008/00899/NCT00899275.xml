	<brief_title>Collecting Storing Samples Blood Tumor Tissue From Patients With Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To collect biological specimen patient osteosarcoma Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) institution . - To provide repository long-term storage osteosarcoma-related biological material . - To make specimen available qualified researcher understand biology osteosarcoma correlate result patient ' clinical data . OUTLINE : After initial submission blood sample , patient may undergo open close biopsy order obtain fresh frozen tissue sample well paraffin embed material . Patients enrol time initial diagnosis definitive surgery develop recurrent disease may submit additional sample ( paraffin block , frozen fresh tumor tissue , slide together blood sample ) . Autopsy tumor sample may also submit .</detailed_description>
