	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn lenalidomide , give stem cell transplant chemotherapy ( bendamustine , fludarabine , rituximab ) , help control CLL . The safety treatment combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nonmyeloablative Stem Cell Transplantation Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . Bendamustine design damage destroy DNA ( genetic material ) cancer cell . Fludarabine design make cancer cell less able repair damage DNA ( genetic material cell ) . This may increase likelihood cell die . Rituximab design attach leukemia cell , may cause die . Before receive study drug , 21 day must pass since last biological therapy , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , investigational therapy . Before begin therapy , follow test procedure perform . The blood may need draw daily . The doctor tell often test need perform : - You physical exam . - You blood transfusion blood platelet need . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 6-10 tablespoon ) draw check effect transplant . - You chest x-ray CT scan check status disease . - You ECG . - You bone marrow biopsy aspirate , doctor think need . Study Treatment : If find eligible take part study , begin treatment within 30 day screen visit . All liquid study drug give central venous catheter ( CVC ) leave place throughout treatment . A CVC sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . On Days -13 , -6 , +1 , +8 , receive rituximab 5-7 hour CVC . On Days -5 -3 , receive fludarabine 1 hour bendamustine 1 hour CVC . You give standard drug hydrocortisone Tylenol help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . On Days -2 -1 , donor relate completely match , receive thymoglobulin ( ATG ) 4 hour CVC . This help reduce risk body reject transplant . On Days -2 -1 , donor relate , `` rest '' ( receive chemotherapy ) . On Day -2 , start receive tacrolimus CVC help prevent graft-versus-host disease . This change dose tacrolimus mouth , discharge hospital . You continue take tacrolimus mouth 6-8 month follow transplant . On Day 0 , blood stem cell collect donor transplant ( give back body ) CVC 30-45 minute . On Days 1 , 3 , 6 stem cell transplant ( Day 11 donor relate completely match ) , receive methotrexate 30-60 minute CVC help prevent graft-versus-host disease . On Day 7 transplant , G-CSF ( filgrastim ) inject skin day white blood cell count recover . Filgrastim design help increase number white blood cell . Treatment Lenalidomide : If blood cell count high enough experienced side effect , Days 90 100 transplant , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . If Group 1 take lenalidomide addition treatment list . If Group 2 , take lenalidomide . If Group 1 , take lenalidomide 1 time every day 3-12 month , depend disease response treatment . You swallow lenalidomide capsule whole , water , time day . Do break , chew , open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . If take prescribe dose lenalidomide seek emergency medical care ( need ) contact study staff right away . You give standard drug aspirin , Coumadin ( warfarin ) , heparin , and/or allopurinol help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . If doctor think need , dose schedule lenalidomide change . If Group 2 , take additional drug . Pregnancy Tests While Taking Lenalidomide : Women able become pregnant must 2 negative pregnancy test : first test within 10-14 day lenalidomide prescribed second test within 24 hour lenalidomide prescribe . This blood test take part routine blood draw . The prescription must fill within 7 day . Once week first month take lenalidomide , woman able become pregnant blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pregnancy test . Then , female regular menstrual cycle , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pregnancy test every 4 week , end study , 28 day last dose lenalidomide . If menstrual cycle irregular , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn every 2 week , end study , 14 28 day last dose lenalidomide . Study Visits ( Groups ) : You must stay Houston area 100 day stem cell transplant . Between Days 25 35 3 month stem cell transplant : - You physical exam . - You CT scan check status disease . - You PET scan check status disease , doctor think need . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check level tacrolimus . - You bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . Study Visits ( Group 1 ) : If Group 1 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test weekly maximum dose lenalidomide reach , every 2 week take lenalidomide . Follow-up : Every 3 month first 18 month every 6 month 3 year : - You physical exam . - You CT scan check status disease . - You PET scan check status disease , doctor think need . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow biopsy check status disease . Length Study : You study 3 year . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : After study , end-of-study visit : - You physical exam . - You CT scan check status disease . - You PET scan check status disease , doctor think need . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow biopsy check status disease . Data Confidentiality Plan : Data collect SCT &amp; CT departmental database ( BMTWeb ) . This database password-protected , contain audit tracking , follow federal guideline . Your personal identifying information remove analysis ; sensitive information share . This investigational study . All drug use study FDA approve commercially available treatment CLL . The use drug together study investigational . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
