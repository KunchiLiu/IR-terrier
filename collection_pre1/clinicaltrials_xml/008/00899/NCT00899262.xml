	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To test make preliminary assessment sensitivity specificity Fourier transform infrared technology ( FTIR ) use early detection lung cancer sputum sample patient participant high risk develop lung cancer non-high-risk smoke non-smoking volunteer . - To permit identification specific metabolic biomarkers within FTIR spectra distinguish lung cancer , high-risk , non-high-risk case . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Sputum sample endobronchial biopsy tissue specimen collect prior routine bronchoscopy part standard clinical assessment early detection lung cancer . Sputum sample examine level bronchial non-bronchial cell use establish cytological immunohistochemical procedure . Samples also examine metabolic biomarkers use Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) generate complete metabolic fingerprint ( i.e. , spectrum ) distinguish metabolic difference cancer , non-cancer , early disease ( i.e. , dysplasia metaplasia ) . These molecular biomarkers , detect within FTIR spectrum , may analyze matched endobronchial biopsy tissue sample histological confirmation . Additional clinico-pathological data collect participant allow development predictive statistical model data . All study participant follow annually .</detailed_description>
