	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample fingernail laboratory patient breast cancer may help evaluate bone health postmenopausal woman undergo hormone therapy breast cancer . PURPOSE : This laboratory study examine fingernail way evaluate bone health postmenopausal woman breast cancer undergo hormone therapy clinical trial IBCSG-1-98 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fingernails Evaluating Bone Health Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer Undergoing Hormone Therapy Clinical Trial IBCSG-1-98</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare effect tamoxifen vs letrozole chemical property fingernails Raman spectroscopy postmenopausal woman breast cancer undergo adjuvant hormonal therapy protocol IBCSG-1-98 . - Determine efficacy nail structure evaluate bone fragility . Secondary - Compare fingernail assessment patient bone fracture v . - Determine natural variation chemical ( Raman spectroscopy ) property 2 fingernail source 1 appointment donor . - Evaluate effect drug treatment ( 6 month ) chemical property fingernails . OUTLINE : This single-blind , multicenter , pilot study . Patients stratify accord treatment protocol IBCSG-1-98 ( tamoxifen v letrozole ) bone fracture ( yes v ) . Fingernail clipping collect baseline 6 month later . Fingernail clipping examine Raman spectroscopy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
