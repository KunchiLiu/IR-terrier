	<brief_summary>This research trial study chitinase 3-like 1 ( cartilage glycoprotein-39 ) ( YKL-40 ) serum sample patient newly diagnose stage III-IV ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal cavity , fallopian tube cancer receive chemotherapy . Studying sample serum laboratory patient receive chemotherapy may help doctor learn effect chemotherapy cell . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>YKL-40 Serum Samples From Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage III-IV Ovarian Epithelial , Primary Peritoneal Cavity , Fallopian Tube Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess ability YKL-40 serum marker detect response lack response primary chemotherapy International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ( FIGO ) stage III IV invasive epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer . II . To compare predictive accuracy YKL-40 cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test ability YKL-40 serum marker detect recurrence ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer patient first remission follow primary chemotherapy . II . To test ability YKL-40 serum marker predict poor risk patient FIGO stage III IV invasive epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore alternative cut-off value YKL-40 elevation large patient population . II . To describe variability YKL-40 CA125 measurement patient receive primary chemotherapy primary remission large patient population . III . To describe accuracy YKL-40 couple CA125 measurement predict chemotherapy response , progression-free survival overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection serum sample analysis YKL-40 via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) CA125 via chemiluminometric sandwich immunoassay follow time-points : baseline ; prior begin course chemotherapy ( course 1-6 ) ; completion chemotherapy ; every 3 month year 1-2 post-chemotherapy ; every 6 month year 3-5 post-chemotherapy ; every year year 6-10 post-chemotherapy ; time disease recurrence progression .</detailed_description>
