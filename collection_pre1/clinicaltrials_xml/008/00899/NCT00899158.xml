	<brief_title>Biological Markers Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Experiencing Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare level caspase-3 phosphorylated Akt ( pAkt ) rectus abdominous muscle patient pancreatic cancer experience cachexia undergo surgery diagnosis primary therapy patient lose weight undergoing abdominal surgery nonmalignant condition . - Compare level urinary 3-methylhistidine ( 3-MH ) patient . - Evaluate possible correlation caspase-3 activity , pAkt , urinary 3-MH early time progression subsequent lean body weight loss patient pancreatic cancer . - Associate excretion urinary 3-MH high level caspase-3 activity pAkt analyze utility 3-MH marker skeletal muscle proteolysis . OUTLINE : This pilot study . During surgery , muscle biopsy perform approximately 1 cm rectus abdominous muscle obtain analysis . Caspase-3 activity total/phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase Akt measure muscle biopsy western blot analysis . 3-methylhistidine activity measure urine sample . After completion study , patient pancreatic cancer follow postoperatively 3 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
