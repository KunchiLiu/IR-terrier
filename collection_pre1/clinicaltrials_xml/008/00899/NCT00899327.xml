	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To identify novel biomarkers disease would help initial diagnosis myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Secondary - To understand genesis anemia cancer . - To identify novel biomarkers disease predict progression MDS acute myeloid leukemia . OUTLINE : Blood bone marrow sample collect . Hemopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) progenitor cell isolate sample analysis . Some HSC progenitor cell use functional assay . From rest cell , DNA , RNA , protein extract molecular analysis , include gene mutation analysis , gene methylation assay , chromatin immunoprecipitation , microarray , real-time polymerase chain reaction .</detailed_description>
