	<brief_title>Collection Storage Blood Tissue Samples From Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery For Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : 1 . To collect , catalog store frozen sample lung carcinoma possible , portion involve lymph node , well adjacent grossly uninvolved lung tissue obtain surgical specimen patient undergo surgical resection previously untreated lung cancer source quality DNA , messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) protein molecular analysis . 2 . To collect , catalog store frozen sample blood pre- post-resection patient provide source reference DNA ass somatic mutation associate tumor preneoplastic `` normal '' lung , allow assessment level circulate marker . 3 . To associate specimen historical , clinical , pathological , outcome information . Grossly viable tumor grossly normal lung tissue identify remove patient surgical specimen cryopreserved shipment Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) Lung Cancer Tissue Bank future use research . Blood specimen also collect prior surgery 4-12 week post-surgery ( start adjuvant therapy ) ship immediately Tissue Bank .</detailed_description>
