	<brief_title>DNA Analysis Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients With Diffuse Brain Stem Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since little known biology diffuse brainstem glioma , goal protocol undertake systematic analysis DNA abnormality , RNA protein expression prospectively collect fresh-frozen fixed tumor sample correspondent normal tissue patient affect tumor . OBJECTIVES : - Perform genome-wide analysis DNA gain loss RNA expression tumor sample normal tissue patient diffuse brain stem glioma . - Identify region genomic gain loss use either array comparative genomic hybridization single nucleotide polymorphism array . - Investigate genome-wide expression pattern RNA derive tumor sample normal tissue patient via Affymetrix gene expression profile . - Validate result genome-wide analysis conduct evaluation candidate gene investigate expression relevant gene product RNA protein level . - Perform analysis mutation candidate tumor-suppressor gene oncogene ( include whole genome sequence study ) use direct sequence analysis tumor DNA confirm tumor-specific nature mutation analyze correspondent constitutional DNA . - Confirm genomic gain loss identify mean fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) perform tissue microarray use non-neoplastic brain tissue patient control available . - Explore protein expression pattern identify immunohistochemistry western blot compare normal brain stem tissue . - To obtain follow-up ( questionnaire and/or telephone interview ) autopsy parent ( ) , legal guardian ( ) , family member research participant United States ass aspect associate procedure , include potential benefit drawback</detailed_description>
