	<brief_title>Identifying Biomarkers Lung Cancer Using Tissue Samples From Patients With Lung Cancer From Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To identify new molecular abnormality specific development squamous cell carcinoma lung . - To determine prevalence candidate biomarkers lung cancer progression . - To determine odds develop lung cancer accord biomarker status preinvasive lesion . - To determine odds develop lung cancer accord proteomic biomarker status normal bronchial epithelium high-risk patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Tissue sample collect time fluorescence bronchoscopy laboratory biomarker study . Blood , sputum , urine sample also collect . Gene protein expression study perform sample use comparative genomic hybridization array , 3q oligonucleotide microarray , matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF ) , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Patients ' medical record review collect information patient 's past medical history pertinent laboratory radiography result . Patients healthy volunteer follow annually via telephone mail questionnaire .</detailed_description>
