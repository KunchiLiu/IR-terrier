	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This laboratory study examine tumor tissue sample patient breast cancer treat bevacizumab clinical trial ECOG-2100 learn DNA change response patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess effect know variant polymorphism ( functionally important association ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) gene outcome ( time progression ) patient breast cancer treat bevacizumab clinical trial ECOG-2100 . Secondary - Assess effect know variant polymorphism ( functionally important association ) VEGF receptor-2 ( KDR ) gene outcome ( time progression ) patient . - Assess effect know variant polymorphism gene efficacy ( objective response rate survival ) patient . - Assess effect know variant polymorphism gene toxicity outcome patient . - Assess effect VEGF polymorphism VEGF expression immunohistochemical staining ( know prognostic marker ) . - Assess effect KDR polymorphism KDR expression immunohistochemical staining . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Tissue genomic DNA sample paraffin-embedded primary tumor examine use standard polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) restriction fragment-length polymorphism , immunohistochemistry , allele-specific PCR , and/or Taqman-based assay . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGF receptor-2 ( KDR ) expression polymorphism assess . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 500 specimen accrue study .</detailed_description>
