	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying gene protein express tissue sample patient cancer may help doctor identify biomarkers related cancer . PURPOSE : This laboratory study evaluate gene protein expression normal tissue tumor tissue patient undergone surgery kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Expression Normal Tissue Tumor Tissue From Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery For Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine expression level novel gene protein ( HFARP , HAMGR28 , HE9NG77 ) freeze normal tissue tumor tissue sample patient undergone nephrectomy renal cell cancer . - Correlate gene protein expression level disease stage , tumor size , pathology report ( e.g. , cell type , grade , tissue architecture ) order evaluate rate gene protein expression target future therapeutic intervention . Secondary - Compare proteomic screen potential biomarkers use exist plasma and/or urine sample patient renal cell cancer breast cancer store CCCWFU Tumor Tissue Core tissue sample patient enrol study . OUTLINE : Normal tumor tissue collect patient undergone nephrectomy diagnostic therapeutic intervention renal cell cancer analyze histopathological expression compare normal kidney cell northern blot . Tissue sample evaluate RNA protein extraction analyze gel electrophoresis , blotting , phosphor-imaging induction suppression gene protein level . These data correlate clinical stage , tumor size , histopathological grade architecture patient 's disease .</detailed_description>
