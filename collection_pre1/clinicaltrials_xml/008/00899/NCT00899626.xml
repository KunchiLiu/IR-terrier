	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tissue , blood , urine , stool , biological fluid patient cancer healthy participant may help doctor identify learn biomarkers related cancer . PURPOSE : This research study look gastrointestinal biomarkers tissue biological fluid sample patient healthy participant undergo colonoscopy , endoscopy , surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastrointestinal Biomarkers Tissue Biological Fluid Samples From Patients Healthy Participants Undergoing Colonoscopy , Endoscopy , Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Identify new potential biomarkers increase gastrointestinal cancer risk use tissue biofluid sample patient healthy volunteer undergo colonoscopy , endoscopy , surgery . - Develop new screen strategy base substance find tissue biofluid sample . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients healthy volunteer undergo colonoscopy , endoscopy , surgery . Patients healthy volunteer also undergo tissue ( e.g. , tumor normal mucosa ) biofluid ( e.g. , blood , urine , cyst fluid tumor cell , bile pancreatic juice , and/or stool ) sample collection . Samples analyze tumor marker proteomic method protein analysis . If candidate biomarkers identify , sample store future study involve biomarkers . Information , include demographic , personal family history cancer , prior current colonoscopy , endoscopy , surgery result , collect medical record store project database . Patients healthy volunteer follow year 5 year determine biomarkers prognostic significance .</detailed_description>
