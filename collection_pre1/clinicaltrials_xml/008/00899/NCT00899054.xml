	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study P276-00 Combination With Radiation Subjects With Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label single arm multicenter trial evaluate safety efficacy P276-00 combination radiation patient recurrent and/or locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma head neck . The Primary objective study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( y ) ( DLT/s ) P276-00 combination radiation subject recurrent and/or locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . The Secondary objective 1 . To evaluate safety tolerability combination regimen P276-00 radiation study population 2 . To analyze pharmacokinetics ( PK ) P276-00 study population 3 . To evaluate efficacy combination regimen P276-00 radiation study population 4 . To perform exploratory analysis biomarkers associate use P276-00 radiation study population . In phase 1 component , cohort 3 subject enrol start dose level P276-00 100 mg/m2/day give intravenously day 1 day 5 21 day cycle 2 cycle combination radiation . If dose well tolerated next cohort enrol high dose level P276-00 . P276-00 dose escalation continue MTD P276-00 combination Radiation determine . The subsequent dose level P276-00 140 mg/m2/day 185 mg/m2/day . In phase 2 component 10 subject enrol MTD P276-00 combination radiation evaluate efficacy . Dose radiation phase 60 Gy 6 week . Safety evaluation conduct regular interval study . Tumor measurement undertaken baseline , end cycle 2 5 6 week end cycle 2 . Response evaluation perform Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Subjects show stable disease well response last assessment follow tumor measurement progression recurrence disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Disease specification : Phase I component : Radiation naïve subject histologically and/ cytologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma head neck nonmetastatic , unresectable recurrent . Radiation naïve subject nonrecurrent , nonmetastatic , unresectable , disease also enrol he/she intolerant and/or unwilling chemoradiotherapy involve standard cytotoxic agent ( e.g . cisplatin , carboplatin , oxaliplatin , 5FU , taxanes , methotrexate , etc ) Phase II component : Radiation naïve subject nonrecurrent , nonmetastatic , unresectable , locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck intolerant and/or unwilling chemoradiotherapy involve standard cytotoxic agent ( e.g . cisplatin , carboplatin , oxaliplatin , 5FU , taxanes , methotrexate , etc ) . 2 . Treatment specification : Phase I Component : subject must receive treatment ( chemotherapy , target biologic agent , radiotherapy , surgery etc ) recurrent disease . Phase II Component : The subject must curatively operated disease . 3 . Subjects must complete prior chemotherapy , biologic/targeted anticancer therapy surgery least 4 week ( least 6 week nitrosureas mitomycin C ) initiation protocol treatment subject must recover ( &lt; = grade 1 ) toxic effect prior therapy 4 .
