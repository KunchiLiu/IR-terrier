	<brief_title>Studying Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To characterize difference tumor morphology molecular feature exist good- poor-prognosis breast cancer determine Oncotype Dx assay ( reverse transcriptase-PCR-based assay ) . - To develop computer-aided design ( CAD ) -based system analysis digitize histological image would perform well Oncotype Dx assay stratify estrogen receptor-positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer prognostic category . - To identify new therapeutic target PI3-kinase signal pathway subset poor-prognosis ER+ breast cancer . OUTLINE : Patients Oncotype Dx assay ( reverse transcriptase-PCR-based assay ) perform breast cancer identify review medical record . Diagnostic H &amp; E stain tumor tissue sample review pathologist . Relevant pathologic feature tumor ( size , stage , grade , estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , HER2 stain ) link Oncotype Dx score record . The H &amp; E stain tumor tissue sample scan create high-resolution digital image . The image tissue sample subject image analysis algorithms identify set image feature clearly separate tumor low recurrence score high recurrence score . Unstained paraffin section tumor tissue sample , available , process use IHC analyze PI3-kinase signal pathway ( PTEN expression ) . Staining component PI3-kinase signal pathway , phospo-AKT , proteins interest also perform . DNA extract sample subject pyrosequencing analysis exon 9 20 PI3KCA . Sequencing relevant potential oncogene , AKT , also perform . Statistical analysis perform look correlation Oncotype Dx score presence PI3KCA mutation and/or loss PTEN expression .</detailed_description>
