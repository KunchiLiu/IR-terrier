	<detailed_description>Noxious stimulus occur intra-operatively post-operatively generate central sensitization , decrease pain threshold ultimately increase analgesic requirement . The pathophysiology central sensitization think involve excitatory amino acid receptor implicate prolongation painful state animal model . The N-methyl-d-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor one excitatory amino acid receptor ( 1 , 2 ) . The underlie mechanism central sensitization think involve c-fiber associated injury occur incision . Crile Wall bring concept attenuation central sensitization could accomplish via provision analgesic intervention ( opioids , local anesthesia ) prior noxious insult . They term central sensitization attenuation preemptive analgesia . The concept preemptive analgesia later expand implicate pre post-incisional noxious stimulus part process , result study design provide intervention throughout surgical intervention ( peri-procedural ) ( 3 ) . Reduction analgesic requirement pain score five half-lives ( 1st order kinetics ) follow provision intervene analgesic agent peri-procedurally know preventative analgesia . The term preemptive analgesia reserve intervention occur noxious stimulus . Multiple study investigate concept preemptive analgesia preventative analgesia provide variety analgesic intervention various time throughout surgical insult addition conventional mean anesthesia provision , include opioids , Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAID ) , Cyclooxygenase-II ( COX-2 ) inhibitor , alpha-2 agonist , ketamine ( 4 , 5 , 6 ) . Preemptive preventative analgesia use variety pharmacological agent least partially know mechanisms action provide insight potential mechanism central sensitization . Ketamine N-methyl-d-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist show useful reduction acute postoperative pain analgesic consumption variety surgical intervention variable route administration . It also show effective presence absence opioids , suggest one mechanism action preemptive preventative analgesia , include limited decreasing central excitability , decrease acute post-operative opioid tolerance , possible modulation opioid receptor ( 7 ) . Ketamine common anesthetic agent use since Vietnam War . Clinically , ketamine provide pain relief minimal respiratory depression , high dos ( 1-2mg/kg ) induce general anesthesia maintain blood pressure cardiac output . Recently , qualitative systematic review role NMDA receptor antagonist complete . Twenty-four study investigate role ketamine meet inclusion criterion study , 58 % demonstrate preemptive preventative analgesic effect . Patients underwent variety surgical procedure , ambulatory inpatient , obvious effect either surgical type dose ketamine ( range 0.15 1mg/kg ) success preventative intervention . However , author unable quantify degree reduction primary end-points ( opioid consumption , pain score , ) due variability record data . In addition , inpatient study limit abdominal procedure outpatient study investigate mainly knee arthroscopy , provide insight degree impact NMDA receptor antagonism set high pre-operative opioid tolerance combine surgical procedure know associate invariably high degree post-operative pain . Of note , 1/24 study document significant difference side effect related ketamine provision patient receive 20mg epidural ketamine ( 7 ) . Laminectomy procedures provide unique opportunity evaluate preemptive preventative impact ketamine primary end point acute post-operative pain score opioid consumption patient population opioid dependence high degree post-operative intra-operative noxious stimulus . The goal double blind , randomize placebo control trial test presence , quantify , preemptive preventative analgesic effect ketamine infusion patient population . Such insight may lead good pain control , improve satisfaction , ultimately reduction side-effects related post-operative opioid use include limited respiratory depression , constipation , delirium .</detailed_description>
