	<brief_summary>Hip fracture mostly occur elderly people low bone strength . Bone strength determine bone mineral density ( BMD ) , bone turnover , microarchitectural geometrical property bone . Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) standard technique measure BMD . However , BMD provide information regard quantity mineral bone , one component bone strength . To date reliable method ass bone strength vivo . Therefore , method ass bone strength beyond BMD would provide additional information regard patient ' risk bone relate fixation failure fracture fixation . DensiProbe new diagnostic device develop intra-operative assessment mechanical stability bone proximal femur . It consist drill bit like tool electronic system measure peak torque break-away trabecular bone femoral head patient undergoing DHS surgical treatment . In cadaver study compare bone mineral density measure quantitative compute tomography bone strength measure DensiProbe high correlation two parameter could show . In clinical pilot study significant correlation DensiProbe measurement BMD measure DXA femoral neck patient hip fracture could show . However , perfect correlation expect DensiProbe measure bone strength , partly cause BMD . Bone related fixation failure , secondary loss reduction , influence bone strength , bone mineral density , fracture type , fracture reduction primary positioning implant . The predictive value DensiProbe measurement secondary loss reduction need investigate . If DensiProbe turn effective screening tool patient low bone strength high risk aforementioned complication patient may future benefit alternative treatment method ( e.g . augmentation technique ) order reduce bone relate fixation failure . The primary aim present study investigate bone strength measure DensiProbeTM Hip ( DensiProbe ) independent factor predict secondary loss reduction ( screw migration 5 mm / telescope 10 mm ) patient hip fracture fracture fixation DHS .</brief_summary>
