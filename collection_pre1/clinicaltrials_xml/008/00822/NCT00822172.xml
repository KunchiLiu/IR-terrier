	<brief_title>Evaluation Cilostazol Combination With L-Carnitine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral Artery Disease ( PAD ) narrow blood vessel supply leg blood . It cause atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) . Muscles require oxygen carry blood . When leg muscle get enough blood oxygen , cause pain , cramping , fatigue , and/or discomfort leg muscle walk exercise . These symptom call intermittent claudication ( IC ) . In severe case , tissue get enough blood oxygen rest , pain may also present legs resting . Peripheral Artery Disease ( PAD ) one common cause pain disability people 55 75 year age . Cilostazol medication currently available prescription intermittent claudication . L-carnitine over-the-counter supplement . It natural substance human body also red meat , nut , energy drink . Some subject study take L-carnitine cilostazol others take placebo cilostazol . The purpose study see safe effective L carnitine take cilostazol compare placebo take cilostazol people intermittent claudication . A placebo tablet pill look like regular medication , n't actual medicine . A second purpose study see L-carnitine absorbed blood stream .</detailed_description>

Ankle brachial index ( ABI ) &lt; 0.90 least one extremity , Ankle brachial index ( ABI ) ≥ 0.90 ≤ 1.0 , reduction least 20 % Ankle brachial index ( ABI ) , least one extremity , measure within 1 minute claudicationlimiting treadmill test . If subject noncompressible artery toe brachial index ( TBI ) &lt; 0.70 require least one extremity . Symptoms Intermittent Claudication ( IC ) must stable least 3 month prior Screening 1 . Peak Walking Time ( PWT ) ≥ 1 ≤ 12 minute Gardner protocol Screening 2 . If subject currently statin therapy , need statin therapy least 3 month prior Screening 1 . Subjects recently discontinue statin therapy must `` washout '' least one month prior Screening 1 . Tolerance background therapy cilostazol ( approximately 2 week 50 mg mouth ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) , approximately 1 week 100 mg PO BID ) Screening 2 Baseline Visit . Subjects must either male female postmenopausal , surgically incapable bearing child childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test Screening 1 negative urine pregnancy test Day 0 must agree use doublebarrier contraceptive method end investigational therapy ( Day 180 Visit ) . The subject able comply schedule visit , treatment plan laboratory test . The subject willing participate study document write informed consent . During tolerance phase Screening period , subject demonstrate least 70 % compliance cilostazol willing continue treatment . Evidence critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) ( e.g. , ischemic rest pain ischemic ulceration ) . The subject major amputation leg amputation limit walk ability . The subject diabetes mellitus type 1 poorly control diabetes mellitus type 2 ( hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) &gt; 10 ) . The subject transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) deep vein thrombosis last 3 month . The subject stroke within last 6 month . The subject participate angiogenic gene therapy study , unless know give placebo . The subject follow laboratory parameter Screening 1 : Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) total bilirubin &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Hemoglobin ( Hb ) &lt; 10 g/dL White blood cell ( WBC ) count &lt; 3.0 x 103/µL ; &gt; 15 x 103/µL Platelet count &lt; 100 x 103/µL The subject walk less 1 minute 2 mile per hour ( mph ) , 0 % grade determine Screening 1 treadmill familiarization . The subject clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities rest change exercise postexercise Screening 2 Day 0 . The subject history clinical evidence congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , clinicianinvestigator concurs . The subject uncontrolled hypertension ( rest blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 180/100 mmHg ) uncontrolled arrhythmic disorder Screening 1 . History coronary peripheral revascularization within 6 month prior Screening 1 . The subject plan undergo coronary peripheral revascularization course study . The subject currently take Lcarnitine medication claudication ( include pentoxifylline cilostazol ) . In situation , subject would become eligible Screening 1 6 week washout medication . Subjects currently take anticipate take ketoconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin . The subject would become eligible Screening 1 immediately completion therapy discontinuation drug ( ) . The subject know , active malignancy require active antineoplastic therapy . ( stable basal cell skin cancer allow . Cancer treat soley hormonal therapy allow . ) The subject severe comorbidity expect survival le 2 year . The subject 's Peak Walking Time ( PWT ) limit symptoms claudication ( e.g. , shortness breath ( SOB ) , fatigue , angina , arthritis , etc. ) . If , opinion investigator , subject improve Peak Walking Time ( PWT ) study therapy extent walk would limited symptom claudication , subject enrol . The subject history alcohol substance abuse within 6 month Screening 1 . The subject inability tolerate oral medication administration . The subject know suspect allergy study medication ( ) class study medication ( ) ( cilostazol Lcarnitine ) administer . The subject initiate exercise training program within 3 month Screening 1 , inability maintain current level physical activity throughout study , subject plan enrol exercise training program study . The subject plan change his/her smoke status plan duration study ( subject advise stop smoke best his/her health ) . The subject currently pregnant breastfeeding . The subject receive investigational drug biological agent within 30 day prior Screening 1 . The subject currently participate plan enroll another clinical trial study . The subject clinically significant medical psychiatric condition opinion Investigator could impact subject 's ability successfully complete trial . In Investigator 's opinion , subject experienced Adverse Events ( AEs ) tolerance phase Screening period present potential ongoing safety concern .</criteria>
