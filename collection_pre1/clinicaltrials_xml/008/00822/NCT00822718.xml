	<brief_summary>According Seoul cancer registry data ( 2000 ) , cancer become leading cause death Korea , account 23.9 % death gastric cancer prevalent malignant neoplasm , comprise 20.8 % cancer . Korea part Asian country high incidence gastric cancer world . Therefore , gastrectomy become one common cancer operation Korea . Thanks early detection intervention , mortality early gastric cancer drop dramatically believe one curable disease among cancer . However , successful operation declaration cure stomach cancer , patient leave without stomach remain life . If patient lose stomach tissue , several problem , include loss reservoir function food indigestion . Besides , loss appetite paramount importance stomach important endocrine organ control appetite via gut-brain axis main axis hormone call ghrelin , orexigenic hormone human . Because ghrelin mainly secrete fundus body , operation laryngoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass : ( LRYGBP ) , laryngoscopic-adjustable silicone gastric banding ( LASGB ) virtually abolish ghrelin express cell . Thus loss appetite inevitable consequence . Then happen plasma ghrelin Billoth surgery ( standard gastric cancer operation ) remove antrum body stomach ghrelin express cell relatively less distribute ? Also puzzle fact surgery patient start gain weight others continue lose weight appetite . Are ghrelin-expressing cell hyperplasia patient start gain weight ? The gastrectomy operation perform investigator institute Billoth I II operation . The operation virtually eliminate half body antrum . If fundus involve also , proximal gastrectomy operation choice . Most patient operation lose weight 1-3 month surgery , thereafter slowly recover . However , mechanism weight recovery elucidate far . To elucidate mechanism re-gaining body weight possible ghrelin express cell hyperplasia , investigator design prospective study investigate stomach tissue well plasma ghrelin patient go Billoth surgery . The item investigate include plasma hormone ( ghrelin , leptin , insulin , CCK , PYY ) , stomach tissue ghrelin , diet evaluation body weight ( body mass index ) change 7 month gastrectomy . The investigator hope study reveal valuable information body weight recovery appetite issue . So far issue stomach cancer patient related survival issue . However , lead comfortable life quality life also important . The investigator approach hint way surgery benefit patient live happy life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The item include study . - diet evaluation : standard three-day diet evaluation table ( Dept . Nutrition ) - body weight height : BMI . - ELISA plasma ghrelin , leptin , insulin , CCK , PYY : whole blood 5 ml EDTA tube ( sampling time : fasting , around 8 AM-9 AM possible ) - two biopsy specimen : site . Fundus . One ELISA one IHC - ELISA tissue ghrelin : frozen liquid nitrogen - immunohistochemistry ghrelin produce cell hyperplasia , Paraffin block cut immunohistochemistry</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patient informed consent gastric cancer patient treat subtotal gastrectomy ( without chemotherapy radiation therapy ) : Actually differentiation EGC AGC depend depth invasion . Therefore patient cachetic metastasis tumor burden , need toe exclude AGC patient study . patient chemotherapy radiation therapy diabetes mellitus : It report plasma ghrelin influence insulin . Thus history diabetes exclude enrollment protocol .</criteria>
