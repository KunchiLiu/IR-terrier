	<brief_title>The Effect Plantar Vibration Progression Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Peripheral neuropathy prevalence approach 10 % general population . The pathophysiology peripheral neuropathy poorly understood undetermined . While many cause peripheral neuropathy know , significant number case idiopathic . The common cause neuropathy relates glucose intolerance overt diabetes . Exogenous factor smoke constrict small cutaneous blood vessel , thereby inhibit small nerve fiber nutrition . Symptoms neuropathy include numbness , pain , difficulty balance , lack temperature perception , weakness lead significant disability . Classification neuropathy make base nerve fiber size : large fiber , small fiber mixed large small fiber type . Plantar vibration affect large fiber demonstrate enhance peripheral systemic blood flow , peripheral lymphatic venous drainage ( Stewart , Karman , Montgomery , &amp; McLeod , 2005 ) . Since fluid retention axon , nerve sheath surround connective tissue may contribute neuropathy , hypothesize plantar vibration may repair small peripheral fiber , thereby improve symptom neuropathy . Purposes : 1 . To assess effect plantar vibration regeneration small peripheral nerve fiber , peripheral neuropathy quality life patient diagnose peripheral neuropathy . 2 . To assess correlation health history , demographic variable , diet , alcohol smoke history small fiber neuropathy analysis skin biopsy plantar vibration . Design : The study employ cross-over experimental design subject act control . Independent variables plantar stimulation ( intervention ) , characteristic subject include health history , demographic variable , self report diet , alcohol , smoke history , well urinary cotinine ( quantitative measure smoke history ) . The dependent variable assay intraepidermal nerve fiber small-fiber neuropathy , clinical assessment peripheral neuropathy , serum level Hgb A1C , quality life measurement .</detailed_description>
