	<brief_summary>The purpose study find high dose vandetanib safely give repeat radiation therapy . This study drug design block certain chemical pathway stimulate tumor grow . The study drug show slow growth number type cancer . This dose escalation study . A dose escalation study mean successive group patient receive high dos study drug . There three dose level . The dose study drug receive depend stage study reach time patient decides participate . In addition take study drug patient also receive radiation therapy brain tumor 3 day . Hypothesis The objective study determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) VANDETANIB give 36 Gy hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy . The MTD dose VANDETANIB patient develop acute grade 5 toxicity less 30 % patient develop acute ( within 30 day radiation therapy ) delayed ( least 30 day radiation complete ) dose limit toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening Prior receive treatment , test perform determine overall medical condition . This include blood test , question medical history , physical neurological exam . MRI scan brain , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) chest X-ray perform baseline study perform last 28 day . Women child-bearing potential also serum pregnancy test within 2 day take study drug . During treatment If study criterion meet subject enrol study , start take study drug least 7 day radiation therapy . You take study drug day mouth . You take study drug time day . If forget take dose , take miss dose soon remember , long least 12 hour next dose due . If less 12 hour next dose , take dose miss . If throw within 30 minute take study drug , take another dose , use medicine stop relieve vomit per doctor 's instruction . You continue take study drug total duration one year . The study stop disease progress excessive toxicity . Your participation study one year . However , continue follow disease status , general health possible treatment-related side effect one year long possible . This Phase I study . These type study usually include small number subject often call dose-escalation study . Subjects first dose group receive small dose study drug . If unacceptable side effect observed subject , next group subject receive next high dose study drug . The study drug dos plan follow : Dose Level Drug dose Level 1 100 mg day Level 2 200 mg day Level 3 300 mg day You assign one three level depend enter study . You also receive radiation therapy . The radiation dose patient . Radiation therapy begin least 7 day begin take study drug . The radiation therapy day 3 consecutive day . A special plastic mask make use hold head still radiation treatment . Tests procedure perform throughout treatment determine cancer respond monitor safety purpose . The test procedure schedule . The following test procedure perform : - Physical examination , neurological examination , ECG , right , first , second , fourth , eighth twelfth week drug treatment ; every three month . - Brain MRI quality life questionnaires one month three month radiation therapy , every three month . - Chest X-ray doctor determines . Follow-up You also follow-up visit doctor month first 6 month , every three month . You may also see doctor anytime need . Duration You study 12 month .</detailed_description>

Prior radiation therapy brain within 2 month . Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease concurrent condition ( severe cognitive impairment ) pregnant breastfeed woman exclude Treated clinical protocol nonapproved investigational drug within 30 day Day 1 study treatment . Any evidence clinically active interstitial lung disease ( patient chronic stable radiographic change asymptomatic need exclude ) Clinically significant cardiac event History arrhythmia . Atrial fibrillation , control medication exclude . Previous history correct electrocardiogram QT interval ( QTc ) prolongation result medication require discontinuation medication . Congenital long QT syndrome , 1st degree relative unexplained sudden death 40 year age Presence leave bundle branch block QTc Bazett 's correction unmeasurable , 480 msec screen ECG . If patient QTc 480 msec screen ECG , screen ECG may repeat twice ( least 24 hour apart ) . The average QTc three screen ECGs must less 480 msec order patient eligible study . Concomitant medication may cause QTc prolongation , induce Torsades de Pointes induce cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) function Hypertension control medical therapy ( systolic blood pressure great 160 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure great 100 mm Hg ) Active diarrhea may affect ability patient absorb VANDETANIB . Major surgery within 4 week , incompletely heal surgical incision start study therapy Clinical and/or radiographic evidence bleed recurrent brain tumor . Patients currently enzyme induce anticonvulsant . However , patient eligible enzyme induce anticonvulsant discontinue switched non enzyme induce anticonvulsant one week study entry . Nonenzyme induce anticonvulsant may cause QTc prolongation , induce Torsades de Pointes induce CYP3A4 function Laboratory result : Serum bilirubin great 1.5 x upper limit reference range ( ULRR ) Serum creatinine great 1.5 x ULRR creatinine clearance le 50 mL/minute ( calculate CockcroftGault formula ) Potassium , less 4.0 mmol/L despite supplementation ; serum calcium ( ionize adjust albumin , ) magnesium normal range despite supplementation Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) great 2.5 X ULRR</criteria>
