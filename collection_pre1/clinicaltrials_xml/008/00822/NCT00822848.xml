	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , epirubicin ifosfamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose sorafenib give together epirubicin , ifosfamide , radiation therapy follow surgery treating patient high-risk stage II stage III soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose sorafenib tosylate combine epirubicin hydrochloride , ifosfamide , hypofractionated radiotherapy prior surgery patient high-risk stage II III soft tissue sarcoma extremity body wall . Secondary - To examine , preliminarily , activity regimen , term time local recurrence , distant disease-free survival , progression-free survival , overall survival , histologic necrosis rate ≥ 95 % , patient . - To investigate level tumorigenic angiogenic marker , include phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( p-ERK ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , serum vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( sVEGFR-2 ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , plasma tumor tissue sample baseline treatment . - To evaluate expression tumor proliferation angiogenic factor , include p-ERK , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( VEGFR2 ) Platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , tumor tissue sample measure Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study sorafenib tosylate . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate* twice daily begin 2 week initiation chemotherapy continue completion chemotherapy . Patients also receive epirubicin hydrochloride** IV ifosfamide IV 90 minute day 1-3 pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 4 filgrastim ( G-CSF ) ( SC ) daily begin day 4 continue 10 day blood count recover . Chemotherapy repeat approximately every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . During course 2 , patient also undergo 8 fraction external beam radiotherapy daily day 1-10 total dose 28 Gy . Between course 3 4 , patient undergo surgical resection . Beginning approximately 2 week surgical resection , patient positive surgical margin undergo 6 fraction boost external beam radiotherapy daily total dose 12 Gy . NOTE : *Sorafenib discontinue 1 week surgery resume 1 week surgery . NOTE : **Epirubicin omit course 2 . Plasma tumor tissue sample collect periodically correlative laboratory study . Plasma tumor tissue sample analyze ELISA measurement tumorigenic angiogenic marker , include p-ERK , VEGF , sVEGFR-2 , bFGF . Tumor tissue sample also analyze IHC p-ERK , VEGFR2 , phospho-VEGFR2 , PDGFR , phospho-PDGFR . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
