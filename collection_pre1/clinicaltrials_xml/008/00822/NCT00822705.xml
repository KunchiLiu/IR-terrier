	<brief_title>Inhibition Food Intake Response Oral GLP-1 Peptide YY3-36</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PYY3-36 GLP-1 two classical gastrointestinal peptide , release circulation meal L-cells distal gut ; compel evidence participates control appetite regulate individual meal size healthy subject , also patient obesity diabetes type II . The regulation human eat habit , however , highly complex understand appetite control far complete . In many area knowledge rather rudimentary ; little known , give example , importance individual signal interaction . From study animal human know individual satiety signal interact : contribution glucagon CCK produce functionally synergistic inhibition feed rat , , simultaneous injection two peptide inhibit feed significantly sum individual effect . In contrast , unable show healthy volunteer interaction GLP-1 CCK33 ; simultaneous infusion CCK33 GLP-1 result infra-additive reduction meal size , lead u suggest two peptide could even interact antagonistically . To explore potential interaction two well-known satiety signal , plan investigate effect individual dos PYY3-36 GLP-1 , interaction control food intake satiety healthy male subject .</detailed_description>
