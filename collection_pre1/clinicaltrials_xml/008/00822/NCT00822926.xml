The investigator observe prolonged profound analgesia follow subcutaneous superficial injection Botulinum Toxin Type A ( BTA ) patient certain type neuropathic pain . investigator propose study addition BTA extend pain relief compare placebo inject subcutaneously area cutaneous allodynia ( property normally non-noxious stimulus perceive painful ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Botulinum Toxin Cutaneous Allodynia - Enriched Responder Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients post-herpetic neuralgia , complex regional pain syndrome , post-surgical neuromatous pain patient mark cutaneous allodynia . Touching skin normally non-painful stimulus result pain . Injected local anesthetic often effective provide temporary relief . In course clinical practice investigator observe number patient cutaneous allodynia mark persistent benefit subcutaneous injection Botulinum toxin Type A . Rather kill targeted neuron , Botulinum toxin type A inhibit release acetylcholine cholinergic nerve terminal prolong ultimately reversible manner . Neuropathic pain hallmark allodynia classically difficult treat . Standard treatment tricyclic antidepressant , anti-epileptic drug , opiates spinal cord stimulation frequently disappointing leave patient refractory pain . Surgical percutaneous ablation involve nerve fall favor among many due disappointing result . A pilot study need assess efficacy superficially inject Botulinum Toxin type A treatment cutaneous allodynia spontaneous pain among patient neuropathic pain .</detailed_description>
