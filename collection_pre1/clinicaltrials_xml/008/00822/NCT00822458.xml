	<brief_title>GDC-0449 Treating Young Patients With Medulloblastoma That Recurrent Did Not Respond Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To investigate safety pharmacokinetics daily dose hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 use available formulation pediatric patient recurrent refractory medulloblastoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To document describe toxicity associate drug patient . II . To characterize pharmacokinetics drug patient . III . To document preliminary antitumor activity drug patient . IV . To document pathologic genomic method identify CNS tumor activation PTCH/SHH pathway . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 daily day 1 4-28 course 1 day 1-28 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 28 day 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic study . Archival tumor tissue sample collect analyzed expression gene activate SHH ( e.g. , Gli1 , Gli2 , SFRP1 , ATOH1 , PTCH2 ) WNT ( e.g. , DKK2 DKK4 ) cell signal pathway situ hybridization reverse transcriptase real time-PCR . After completion study therapy , patient follow 90 day .</detailed_description>
