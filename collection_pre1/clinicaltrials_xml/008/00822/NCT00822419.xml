	<brief_title>Percutaneous Ketamine Versus Lidocaine Mid-Sternotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ketamine hydrochlorid general anesthetic also use short term sedative . Ketamine antagonistic effect central spinal N-Methyl-D-Aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor , latter modulate pain stimulus generate peripherally way central pain center . Ketamin use recently pre-operatively rather post-operatively . Our recent experience pre-operative use ketamine analyze yet Tel Aviv Medical Center 's researcher . There also experience topical dermal , epidural , intra-articular oral usage ketamine . As far , report patient ' subjective feeling ketamine give pre-operatively postoperative acute pain patient undergo mid-sternotomy lung cardiac surgery . The possible influence effect patient 's well-being patient 's family feeling reaction neither explore . The goal study examine possibility ketamine administer pre-operative period , topical ointment , induce change patient 's sensation pain , satisfaction , possibly family 's satisfaction well . The basis contention administer less morphine ( give patient immediate post-operative period PCA [ Patent-Controlled Analgesia ] ) , without change pain , might positive effect patient 's well family 's . This issue assess verbal questionnaire base visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Three group 25 patient enrol study . The first group receive placebo topical paste produce hospital pharmacy . The second group give lignocain paste , third group get ketamine topical paste , prepared pharmacy well . The study double blind randomize . All patient treat morphine postoperatively , mention . It anticipate amount morphine use patient postoperatively patient treat ketamine reduce compare group . This might increase patient 's family 's satisfaction rate , regardless decrease subjective pain rating . The importance study contention basis study proven true , similar surgical group patient benefit addition topical ketamine administration habitual morphine-used postoperative analgesia . By , complication stem high dos morphine diminish , thus maintain hemodynamic stability benefit advantage patient awake , cooperative able feedback medical personnel real time condition . Cooperation satisfaction patient family could end result process . Finally , assume condition number complication postoperative period , minimize , hasten rehablitation .</detailed_description>
