	<brief_title>S100 Protein Minor/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly two hundred thousand head injury case ( Traumatic Brain Injury - TBI ) report year France . Less 5 % severe , defined Glasgow score ( GCS ) 9 . Epidemiological study indicate TBI fourth lead cause death disability industrialize country . Major cause mild/minor TBI fall domestic trauma elderly child , sport accident . The minor/mild brai injury ( MBI ) may represent 5 10 % emergency consultation UAA . The severity head injury assess Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) , TBI divide three group : minor ( 13-15 ) , moderate ( 9-12 ) , severe ( 3-8 ) . Definition TCC considerably evolve past 20 year , take account pathophysiologic lesion secondary related systemic factor ( hypotension , hypoxia ... ) intracranial factor ( intracranial hypertension , seizures committal ... ) . These side event , occur within hour day primary injury cause impact ( contusion , hematoma , deceleration ) , increase morbidity initial event , must therefore detect early fully . The diagnosis TBI require image data craniocerebral tomography ( CCT ) , renew 24 hour necessary following day . Until , pertinent biological marker propose complete clinical/imagery investigation mild/moderate TBI . S100B protein ( S100 ) constitutive protein glial cell , whose physiological function intracellular , i.e . intracytosolic calcium binding , extracellular , e.g . promote neuritic proliferation and/or neuronal apoptosis . Due specificity cellular expression , S100B protein useful biological marker acute neurological disorder , ischemic haemorrhagic stroke , traumatic head injury . hemorrhage , ischemic stroke ) traumatic ( TCC ) . Plasma S100 significantly increase subject major TCC , also majority minor moderate TBI . A prognostic value S100 also suggest : patient exhibit medical social sequelae several month TBI also shoe high plasma level S100 first hour head injury . Such result international clinical study propose S100 biomarker diffuse brain injury , indicate importance early determination plasma concentration S100 integration among element diagnosis ( image ) assess severity trauma short long term . Medical objective study : 1. ass contribution early determination ( medical care ) S100 diagnosis minor/moderate TBI ( TCCMM - Glasgow sup equal 9 ) , 2. determine usefulness second dosage three hour later medical decision . In word , compare S100 biomarker CCT consider reference ( `` Gold Standard '' ) diagnosis exclusion TCCMM , precise term use . Economic objective : conduct cost-effectiveness study blood level determination S100 vs. CCT diagnosis minor/moderate TBI medical/social consequence .</detailed_description>
