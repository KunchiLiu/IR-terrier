	<brief_title>Thermogard™ Efficacy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothermia severely burn show disrupt coagulation , impair myocardial function , weaken host immune response , delay wound heal increase mortality . Current method available prevent reverse hypothermia include administer heat , humidify oxygen , infuse warm intravenous fluid centrally , perform peritoneal dialysis warm fluid , undergo extracorporeal blood warm partial bypass , markedly increase ambient room temperature . These method either limit effectiveness impractical potentially dangerous . Furthermore , practice markedly increase ambient room temperature create hostile work environment health care provider may impact patient care . The FDA classify Alsius Thermogard™ heat exchange catheter Class II device 21 C.F.R §§ 870.5900 . It use various clinical application cool patient FDA-approved use warm burn patient . The Thermogard™ integrate electro-mechanical heater/cooler consist temperature monitor , temperature controller unit , heat exchanger unit , roller pump . It supply temperature control sterile saline indwell catheter place percutaneously patient . The catheter place femoral vein ( large catheter three heat exchange balloon ) subclavian jugular vein ( small catheter two heat exchange balloon ) . Sterile saline warm ( maximum temperature 38 °C ) external device pump balloon coaxially mount catheter , enable direct warm blood . The catheter contain temperature probe enable 'closed loop ' temperature control system ; temperature set desire level ( range device 28-38°C , may vary accord installed software ) , device warms patient level increase decreasing temperature circulate saline . The core temperature maintain desired level long attend physician deems necessary . The catheter also two port central venous access , use administer medication and/or blood sample . The purpose study determine Thermogard™ central venous catheter significantly impact heat stress environment operate room allow severely burn patient undergo surgery debridement graft low ambient operate room temperature compare control subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult male nonpregnant female age 1870 great 20 % TBSA burn require excision graft need central venous catheter per ICU admission criterion . Patient patient 's surrogate must able verbalize understanding willingness participate study provide write informed consent Pregnancy . All female admit burn ICU undergo routine serum hCG determine pregnancy status . Those find pregnant exclude entry study Burn patient enrol recombinant Factor VII study due theoretical increase risk clot formation Basic advance enlisted trainee Age great 70 year old due increase mortality rate among severely burn Conditions make placement central venous catheter great normal risk ( vascular anomaly , previous vascular surgery , etc . )</criteria>
