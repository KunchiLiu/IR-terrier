	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill cancer cell . G-CSF may help lessen side effect patient receive chemotherapy . Imaging procedure , fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT imaging , may help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT imaging see well work assess response combination chemotherapy allow doctor plan good additional treatment treat patient stage III stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0816 Fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT Imaging Combination Chemotherapy With Without Additional Chemotherapy G-CSF Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate 2-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) HIV-negative patient stage III-IV Hodgkin lymphoma treat response-adapted therapy base fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -PET image 2 course doxorubicin hydrochloride , bleomycin , vinblastine , dacarbazine ( ABVD ) . - To estimate 2-year PFS patient PET-positive treatment 2 course ABVD escalate dose regimen comprise cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , etoposide , vincristine sulfate , bleomycin , procarbazine hydrochloride , prednisone ( BEACOPP ) . Secondary - To estimate 2-year overall survival ( OS ) patient treat regimen . - To estimate response rate ( i.e. , complete partial response ) patient treat regimen . - To evaluate toxicity response-adapted regimen . - To document feasibility centralize , real-time review FDG-PET image U.S. cooperative group study . - To prospectively evaluate overall response rate , complete response rate , PFS , OS HIV-positive patient treat response-adapted regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . All patient undergo baseline whole-body fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -PET/CT image begin chemotherapy . Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , bleomycin IV , vinblastine IV , dacarbazine IV ( ABVD ) day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Between day 22 25 course 2 , patient undergo second FDG-PET/CT scan ass response . Subsequent therapy base FDG-PET/CT scan result . Patients stratify accord FDG-PET positivity ( yes v ) . Patients FDG-PET-negative continue treatment ABVD 4 additional course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients FDG-PET-positive stratified accord HIV positivity ( yes ) receive 1 follow treatment regimen : - Escalated-dose BEACOPP chemotherapy : HIV-negative patient receive escalated-dose BEACOPP chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride IV cyclophosphamide IV day 1 , etoposide IV day 1-3 , oral procarbazine hydrochloride day 1-7 , oral prednisone day 1-14 , bleomycin IV vincristine IV day 8 . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously day 8-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Standard-dose BEACOPP chemotherapy : HIV-positive patient receive standard dose BEACOPP chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride IV cyclophosphamide IV day 1 , etoposide IV day 1-3 , oral procarbazine hydrochloride day 1-7 , oral prednisone day 1-14 , bleomycin IV vincristine IV day 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Six eight week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo post-treatment FDG-PET/CT scan . Some patient may undergo bone marrow biopsy 1 month last course chemotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 7 year .</detailed_description>
