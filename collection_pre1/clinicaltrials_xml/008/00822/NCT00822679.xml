	<brief_title>Eszopiclone Inflammatory Mediators Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abnormalities sleep common hospitalized patient , mechanism consequence well understood . In many patient , sleep disrupt , occur daytime , circadian rhythm diminish lose . Hospitalized patient experience frequent arousal awakening normal show decrease rapid eye movement slow wave sleep . The degree sleep fragmentation least equivalent see patient obstructive sleep apnea . About 20 % arousal awakening related noise , 10 % related health care personnel care-related activity , cause remainder know , although severity underlie disease likely important factor . In study sleep follow acute myocardial infarction , mark disturbance find patient , whether ICU ward . These disturbance include long period wakefulness ; poor sleep efficiency , disruption REM sleep . The fact also loss circadian rhythm patient may indicate widespread disruption bodily homeostasis , turn , may relate infarct , generalize physiological response stress factor . Sleep disruption induce sympathetic activation elevation blood pressure , may contribute patient morbidity . It show increase level inflammatory coagulation factor recovery period follow acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Post MI patient high level TNF-Î± , IL-6 tissue plasminogen activator well low level antithrombin III protein C. The aim study determine whether sleep-aid Eszopiclone improve sleep , decrease inflammation , decrease pro-coagulation factor patient recently suffer myocardial infarction compare control group without sleep aid . Eszopiclone benzodiazepine receptor agonist improve sleep quality reduce time sleep onset reduces wakefulness sleep period . Unlike benzodiazepine , affect deep stage 3 4 sleep . The result provide nearly normal night sleep sleep aid . It hop improved sleep pattern result rapid normalization inflammatory coagulation factor perhaps rapid recovery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients recent ( less equal 8 week ) `` uncomplicated '' acute myocardial infarction , either ST elevation MI ( STEMI ) nonST elevation MI ( nonSTEMI ) subsequent successful treatment ( percutaneous revascularization medical therapy ) . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA , define apneahypopnea index &gt; 15 per hour ) previous diagnosis OSA . Patients lifethreatening arrhythmia ( atrial fibrillation/flutter hypotension , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , significant heart block require pace [ Type III , Type IIb ] ) , cardiogenic shock , severe heart failure require high level inspire oxygen ( FiO2 &gt; 40 % ) , persistent chest pain despite medical intervention , patient consider unstable participate medical reason complication ( concomitant stroke , retroperitoneal hematoma , gastrointestinal bleeding ) . Also exclude patient history cardiac arrest hospitalization . Unable take oral medication Use sedativehypnotics Hypersensitivity Eszopiclone component formulation Pregnancy</criteria>
