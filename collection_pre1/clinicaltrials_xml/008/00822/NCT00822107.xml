	<brief_summary>The purpose study test hypothesis Gitelman syndrome ( GS ) diagnose use simple clinical protocol . GS inherit kidney disease usually show patient low blood potassium level . Currently , commercial genetic test GS exist . Currently , GS diagnose base upon clinical finding method precise often reliable . Thus , order develop new treatment specific GS patient , exact method diagnosis would benefit . Eligible subject men woman age 21-60 normal blood pressure diagnose low blood potassium uncertain cause . Subjects may withdraw time . This study require 3 visit OHSU 's campus . Study Visit 1 occur normal visit nephrologist . As part normal visit , complete interview , physical exam urine blood sample take . In addition , another blood sample take used genetic analysis . A urine pregnancy test administer . A Quality Life survey , describe , administer . The genetic analysis , urine pregnancy test Quality Life survey normal test GS . Blood urine sample , well pregnancy test collected/administered Oregon Clinical Translational Research Institute ( OCTRI ) . During intervention period , subject refrain take potassium spar medication 7 day . This period call washout period need ensure blood test hydrochlorthiazide ( HCTZ , `` water pill '' ) ( see ) , affected medication . On 3rd day washout period , Study Visit 2 occur OCTRI . This require blood drawn , insure subject maintain proper blood level potassium magnesium . Magnesium potassium supplement allow washout . After review blood test result , investigator may adjust dos supplement order keep subject blood level potassium magnesium close normal possible . Blood pressure , heart rate breathing rate also check visit . Study Visit 3 occur OCTRI devote HCTZ test . During course HCTZ test , subject plastic tube ( IV ) place arm vein , vital sign check receive 50mg HCTZ take mouth . Subjects provide 8 urine sample 3 blood sample . The time require visit expect 6 hour . The total time require subject complete study Study Visit 1 discharge OCTRI Study Visit 3 less 9 day subject expect total length exceed three week depend available appointment Study Visit 3 OCTRI . The Quality Life survey derive national research corporation modify use study . The author survey allow free public use document provide properly reference presentation study 's result . HCTZ FDA approve medication . There experimental drug device use study . The purpose study develop method , determine feasibility , perform HCTZ test genetic analysis GS OHSU . There statistical analysis data , descriptive characteristic enter Access database password restrict access . Genetic sample analyze use PCR standard sequence technique . Data sample store maximum 15 year .</brief_summary>
