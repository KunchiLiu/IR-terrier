	<brief_title>The Use Anti-oxidants Reduce Sequela Mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( mTBI ) After Blast Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>5.0 RESEARCH PLAN : The goal study examine use one anti-oxidant , N acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , individual suffer blast injury demonstrate early sequela mTBI . Recent change war fight operational situation change injury pattern troops face aspect military operation . Mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) among common injury see current theater operation . While injury pattern show decrease last twelve month , mTBI blast exposure continue see increase level . This may due part fact research show individual may suffer mTBI secondary blast injury one significant exposure repeat low level exposure common individual rotate back theatre operation second , third , even forth tour duty . The sequela mTBI include balance disorder , hear loss , cognitive dysfunction . These disorder present immediately injury several week injury test function detect injury shortly injury . Evidence exist laboratory work human study anti-oxidant medicine reduce/eliminate sequela mTBI administer within 8-24 hour injury . 5.1 OBJECTIVES : A population single-subject design , double blind , placebo control study compare effectiveness observation administration anti-oxidant NAC placebo individual suffer sequela mTBI single multiple blast exposure . 5.2 HYPOTHESIS : The administration NAC seven day along observation result improve hearing balance function individual demonstrate disorder blast exposure compare placebo medicine observation seven day time point 5.3 SPECIFIC AIMS : 1 . To determine frequency hear loss balance disorder expose blast injury non-emergent non-urgent medical surgical disorder display pattern injury consistent mTBI . 2 . To determine effectiveness one week anti-oxidant , N-acetylcysteine combined observation , reduction hearing loss balance disorder one week injury compare placebo medication observation . 3 . To determine effectiveness one week anti-oxidant , N-acetylcysteine combined observation , reduction hearing loss balance disorder six month injury compare one week placebo medication observation .</detailed_description>
