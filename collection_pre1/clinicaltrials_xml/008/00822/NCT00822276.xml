	<brief_summary>Staphylococcus aureus ( S.aureus ) bacterium cause many painful skin soft tissue condition , scalded-skin syndrome , boil , impetigo . Serious case may result deadly complication S.aureus usually treat successfully antibiotic . There , however , certain strain treat standard antibiotic . Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) one strain . MRSA increasingly see hospital community setting , make serious public health issue . People Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) , particularly history Eczema Herpeticum ( EH ) , may great risk infection MRSA . The reason high risk unknown may link extended treatment staphylococcus antibiotic addition absence certain protein skin , immune function . The purpose study determine reason MRSA infection AD participant without history EH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Underlying Mechanisms For S. Aureus Infection And Colonization Of Skin People With Atopic Dermatitis With And Without Eczema Herpeticum ( MRSA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emergence drug-resistant staphylococcal strain first see US almost decade ago , Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) report four fatal community-based MRSA infection child . In recent year , MRSA grow serious public health concern increase number hospital-acquired community-acquired case see . There approximately 130 participant recruit trial . The study population consist people Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) people without Atopic Dermatitis ( non-atopic ) . AD skin disorder itchy , red skin rash . People AD likely get bacterial viral skin infection , possibly lack certain protein skin , help body 's immune system fight infection . AD people history Eczema Herpeticum ( EH ) may also great risk infect MRSA . This could due extend treatment course staphylococcal antibiotic , especially overuse misuse antibiotic lead bacterial antibiotic resistance . The precise reason unknown . The purpose study determine reason infection AD participant without history EH . Investigators seek recruit patient either Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus ( MSSA ) MRSA bacteria skin , may adequately study potential factor relate MRSA infection . Investigators determine MRSA collect people AD primarily community hospital associate . They also determine protein skin ADEH+ people MRSA differ proteins skin AD people MSSA people without AD , mark difference serum total IgE level AD subject MRSA , MSSA , without S. aureus . Approximately 60 ADEH+ 60 ADEH- participant need enrol find participant MRSA MSSA skin . Presence bacteria skin determine skin swab collect test . If participant deem eligible screening , continue study visit , last approximately 2-3 hour . At study visit , participant ask provide information relate medical history include infection , hospitalization , medication record . Additionally , skin exam perform verify diagnosis ( ADEH- , ADEH+ , non-atopic ) ; nasal skin swab sample collect ; tape strippings sample collect ; blood sample collect .</detailed_description>
