	<brief_title>Prostate Mechanical Imager ( PMI ) Clinical Bridging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical application Prostate Mechanical Imaging ( PMI ) technique prostate assessment examine study . PMI technology base visualization internal structure dimension prostate measure mechanical stress pattern gland surface pressure sensor array . Temporal spatial change stress pattern provide information hardness prostate . Projected patient sample size study 40 men age 21 . Patients select study follow criterion meet : ( 1 ) abnormal DRE finding ; ( 2 ) patient schedule TRUS-guided prostate biopsy and/ radical prostatectomy due abnormal DRE , and/or increase PSA , and/or clinical indication . The study design assess imaging capability PMI three clinical site , perform four physician . Each clinical investigator perform PMI examination 10 respective patient DRE detect abnormality . Pathology data collect TRUS-guided biopsy radical prostatectomy use reference data case discrepancy DRE finding PMI image . Study Hypothesis : Proportion patient PMI reconstruct image anticipate consistent 84 % image capability demonstrate previous clinical study conduct prior version PMI device .</detailed_description>
