	<detailed_description>Urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) arise exclusively urothelium include renal pelvis , ureter , bladder urethra , bladder transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) common form . Arsenic well-established human carcinogen skin lung . Recent study well document long-term exposure inorganic arsenic ingestion inhalation associate increase risk bladder cancer , especially TCC . However , carcinogenic mechanism arsenic-induced UC still unclear . Recently study find cigarette smoking interacts urinary arsenic profile modify UC risk . In addition , also find DNA damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine ( 8-OHdG ) level significantly high UC patient compare healthy control . The mechanism interaction arsenic methylation cigarette UC risk unknown . In addition , whether 8-OHdG related DNA repair enzymes inflammatory factor need explore , therefore specific aim project : 1 . To investigate relationship arsenic methylation enzyme ( AS3MT , PNP , GSTO1 , GSTO2 ) genetic polymorphism UC risk . 2 . To explore relationship cigarette metabolite ( NNK , NNAL , HBA , NNAL-Gluc , O6-Methylguanine , N7-Methylguanine ) UC risk . 3 . To examine relationship cigarette metabolic enzyme ( CYP2A6 , CYP2A13 , UGT2B7 ) genetic polymorphism UC risk . 4 . To elucidate relationship DNA repair enzyme ( MGMT , XPD , XRCC1 , XRCC3 ) gene polymorphism 8-OHdG DNA repair enzymes UC risk . 5 . To examine relationship COX-2 ( -1195G/A、-765G/C 和8473C/T ) , IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-α gene polymorphism 8-OHdG COX-2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-α gene polymorphism UC risk . 6 . To examine risk factor environment-environment , gene-environment , gene-gene interaction risk UC .</detailed_description>
