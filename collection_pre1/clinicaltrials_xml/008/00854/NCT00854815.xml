	<brief_title>Irrigation Versus No Irrigation Perforated Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomized clinical trial involve patient present hospital perforate appendicitis . This definitive study . Power calculation base abscess rate previous prospective study . An unacceptable abscess rate need chosen . Our current rate 20 % , one-fifth patient . If increase 15 % , would place one third patient risk would unacceptable . This comparable 36 % rejection level use previous IRB approve trial ( # 07 02-031 ) . Using delta 0.15 alpha 0.05 power 0.8 , sample size 109 patient arm . Therefore anticipate enrol 220 . Subjects child find severe inflammatory change image high clinical suspicion perforation . Permission obtain parent prior operation . All child duress prior randomization , therefore request waive assent do previous perforate appendicitis study . The final decision include child study make perforation visually confirm surgery . Perforation define identifiable hole appendix stool abdomen . The randomization assignment make known initiation operation , confirmation perforation confirm patient utilize next randomization slot . The irrigation group suction irrigator set 1 liter bag normal saline . The surgeon must use least 500 ml bag may use much choose . The irrigation group suction irrigator set without saline attachment . This leave capacity suction . Since several suction device exist , assure type suction group . After operation , group manage manner . When patient tolerate regular diet , oral pain medication afebrile 12 hour , discharge oral antibiotic complete course 7 day . If stay 5th post-operative day , white blood cell count check , normal , discharge home without antibiotic . This standard post-operative care delineate previous prospective , randomize .</detailed_description>
