	<brief_summary>Reperfusion ischemic myocardium , termed ischemia/reperfusion treatment MI may result paradoxical myocardial injury compromise myocardial salvage leave ventricular functional recovery . Nitric oxide ( NO ) modulate many process contribute ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IR ) inhale NO ( iNO ) show decease infarct size animal model IR . iNO study various clinical setting show promise im modulate detrimental effect IR . Clinical toxicity potentially associate use iNO apparent concern study . Although controlled trial iNO therapy human acute MI publish , anecdotal experience indicate beneficial impact iNO hemodynamic course patient right ventricular MI . iNO widely use treat neonatal hypoxemia acute pulmonary hypertension . iNO study dose various clinical setting side effect relate use dose extremely uncommon . The effect iNO IR injury patient acute ST-segment elevation MI unknown . The investigator intend perform prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , clinical trial iNO patient acute MI undergo primary percutaneous intervention determine whether form therapy decrease infarct size improve clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Placebo-controlled Trial Inhaled iNO Acute ST-segment Elevation MI Treated Primary Angioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible consent patient randomly assign either 2 treatment arm use computer-generated randomization sequence . Treatment arm : 1 ) Intervention group , treat inhalation mixture NO 80 ppm oxygen ; , 2 ) Control group , inhalation oxygen nitrogen ( placebo ) . In group , oxygen administer minimal FiO2 require maintain arterial oxygen saturation determine pulse oxymetry &gt; 97 % . Inhalation treatment give throughout angioplasty procedure via reservoir face mask dedicate respiratory circuit . Nitric oxide deliver use FDA-approved device market Israel license Ministry Health . The device routine clinical use intensive care unit , neonatal care unit , catheterization laboratory . An NO-level detector employ catheterization laboratory monitor ambient NO exposure staff . Upon arrival catheterization laboratory , 40 ml blood sample obtain full chemistry panel , lipid level , complete blood count . Creatine kinase , creatine kinase MB fraction , troponin I measure baseline every 4 hour follow angioplasty procedure first 24 hour , every 6 hour second third day , clinically indicate thereafter.Methemoglobin level measure baseline , every 30 minute throughout interventional procedure , procedure completion , 4 hour post procedure . All patient undergo diagnostic angiography interventional procedure per standard clinical practice . Post procedural pharmacotherapy , sheath removal , deployment hemostatic device leave discretion attend physician . Following treatment catheterization laboratory , medical treatment throughout hospitalization recommendation therapy discharge leave discretion attend cardiologist manage patient care hospital ward . These cardiologist blind patient randomization status .</detailed_description>
