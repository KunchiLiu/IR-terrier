	<brief_summary>The objective study follow : 1 . To assess safety document local systemic toxicity peptide vaccine ( E75 ) node-negative breast cancer patient . 2 . To determine optimal dose immunoadjuvant , GM-CSF , necessary elicit vivo cellular immune response peptide vaccine yet limit toxicity . 3 . To determine optimal inoculation schedule elicit vivo cellular immune response peptide vaccine . 4 . To correlate efficiency elicit vivo cellular immune response peptide vaccine degree HER2/neu expression patient 's tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study HER2/Neu ( E75 ) Vaccine Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common malignancy second common cause cancer-specific death among woman United States . Despite advance diagnosis treatment breast cancer , one third woman develop disease die disease , account approximately 46,300 deaths/year . While good primary therapy available treat early stage breast cancer , substantial failure rate therapy advance disease . Advances understand immune response cancer lead genesis immunotherapeutic approach . Specifically , development anti-cancer vaccine hold promise adjuvant preventive therapy patient primary surgical medical treatment breast cancer , high risk recurrence . While patient hormone receptor positive tumor option undergo hormonal therapy , recurrence especially high among estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor ( ER/PR ) negative patient . For patient , currently good treatment option completion primary therapy ; close surveillance watchful wait standard . It population patient target vaccine strategy induce cellular immunity . In first vaccine study , ( WU # 00-2005 : Phase Ib Trial HER2/neu Peptide ( E75 ) Vaccine Breast Cancer Patients High Risk Recurrence Surgical Medical Therapies ) vaccinate node-positive , HER2/neu-positive breast cancer patient immunogenic peptide HER2/neu protein mix FDA-approved immunoadjuvant , GM-CSF . The study still enrol patient , date vaccine safe limited toxicity effective induce immune response vaccinate peptide . However , early determine immunity protective disease recurrence . However , early immunologic success trial , intend thoroughly study optimal dose schedule vaccination necessary efficiently raise immunity peptide . In order study permeation , need vaccinate significantly patient ; therefore , propose vaccinate node-negative breast patient since 75-80 % patient present early stage breast cancer . Furthermore , intend vaccinate patient regardless HER2/neu status order determine impact prior exposure antigen ability raise immunity HER2/neu . Are patient prior exposure HER2/neu sensitize tolerized antigen ? This question must answer order determine usefulness vaccine truly preventive cancer-na√Øve population .</detailed_description>
