	<brief_summary>Cervical cancer frequent neoplasm fifth mortality rate malignancy woman world . It result 1,000 woman Taiwan 200,000 woman worldwide die cervical cancer year . Human papilloma virus ( HPV ) consistently implicate cause cervical cancer especially high-risk type ( HPV 16,18,31,45 ) strongly associate cervical cancer . Around 50-80 % woman infect HPV within whole life . However , 1 % HPV-infected woman cervical cancer eventually . Seventy 91 % HPV infection could clean host immune response within 1 2 year later . It show host immunity play important role progression , persistence , regression HPV infection . There two main defense line host immunity include innate immunity adoptive immunity . Adoptive immunity play important role defense HPV infection innate immunity . The adoptive immunity could divide humoral immunity cell-mediated immunity . Humoral immunity regulate Th2 helper T lymphocytes generate memory B cell produce antibody provide protective function HPV infection . Cell-mediated immunity regulate Th1 helper T lymphocytes induce antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell could kill HPV-infected cell . Although many research focus immunity HPV infection , conclusion relationship humoral cell-mediated immunity HPV infection roles humoral cell-mediated immunity prognosis HPV-infected population cervical cancer patient . Our research team focus establishment platform cell-mediated immunity HPV infection correlation cell-mediated immunity prognosis HPV-infected population cervical cancer patient year . In order survey host immunity HPV infection comprehensively , propose 3-year proposal . First , would like set platform survey humoral immunity HPV infection normal population patient CIN lesion cervical cancer . Second , would elucidate correlation humoral immunity status clinico-pathologic item HPV-infected population . Third , would like survey humoral immunity correlate prognosis patient cervical lesion . Fourth , would like elucidate correlation betweenHLA haplotype humoral immunity HPV-infected population . Our research result comprehensive overview host immunity HPV infection relate disease . It could provide information prevention treatment HPV infection future .</brief_summary>
