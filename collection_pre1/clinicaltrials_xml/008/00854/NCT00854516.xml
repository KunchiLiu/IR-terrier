	<brief_summary>To assess safety new compression device apply patient ankle brachial pressure index ( ABPI ) 0,5 - 0,8 treat two week daily routine practice . Several perfusion assessment investigate safety reduce compression therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label Clinical Study Assess Clinical Safety New Compression Device Subjects With Peripheral Arterial Vascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous leg ulcer represent common clinical problem increase prevalence age population . It believe venous insufficiency underlie condition responsible 54-81 % leg ulcer . About 8 % leg ulcer related arterial insufficiency 14 % mixed aetiology . Compression therapy consider effective treatment ulcer . The overall cost chronic venous leg ulcer high long term ongoing care require . Also quality life patient jeopardize due long lasting ulcer treatment inconvenient compression therapy . Several compression product available market large body literature describe clinical benefit different compression system . A new treatment approach new device effective working pressure combine low resting pressure . A high working pressure achieve rigid sleeve around patient 's leg essential support muscle pump , necessary sufficient blood reflux . However resting pressure could low without relevant reduction compression efficacy increase safety patient mild moderate peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAOD ) . A high resting pressure believe main reason reduce arterial skin perfusion result pressure relate skin damage . Accordingly compression system indicate patient ABPI low 0.8 . About 25 % patient chronic venous insufficiency suffer PAOD hence difficult treat compression . With new device , patient could sufficiently treat , low resting pressure believe low influence skin perfusion .</detailed_description>
