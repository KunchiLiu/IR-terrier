	<brief_title>The ATLET Study : Can Subjects With Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury Learn Walk ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 100 new case spinal cord injury ( SCI ) year Norway . Most SCI occur traumatic accident among young people adults time productive life . Loss walk stand ability restrict independent mobility autonomy severely impact quality life . The study two arm : 1 ) manual locomotor training ( Tromsø ) 2 ) robot assist training ( Oslo ) . Each study arm 30 patient , randomize receive standard care intervention . The intervention group receive 60 day intensive locomotor train 6 month . Single-blind , before/after evaluation effect perform Sunnaas hospital use standardize set evaluation tool .</detailed_description>
