UCSF Department Obstetrics Gynecology Reproductive Sciences conduct study learn ovarian stimulation oocyte maturation improve fertilization , embryo quality , implantation clinical pregnancy rate patient undergoing vitro fertilization ( IVF ) . Two hormone , follicle stimulate hormone human chorionic gonadotropin ( FSH/hCG ) compare standard one hormone , hCG , ovulation trigger . Over past two decade , success rate assist reproductive technology ( ART ) dramatically increase . This increase largely attributed improvement laboratory condition improvement ovarian stimulation protocol ( medication use increase number eggs mature cycle ) . Less work do different way cause final maturation egg release egg ovary . The investigator propose change final injection prior egg retrieval ( ovulation trigger ) look like happens normal menstrual cycle , two hormone ( luteinizing hormone ( LH ) FSH ) increase . The investigator want find improve egg quality increase chance pregnancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concomitant Administration FSH With HCG Improves Oocyte Maturation Quality Double -Blinded Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We observe ( In vitro fertilization ) IVF , deviation oocyte morphology maturity within individual cohort oocyte degeneration , fail fertilization exist . Regardless , even fertilization occur , large proportion embryo fail progress pre-implantation stage development . In order fertilization embryo development occur , oocyte must mature develop `` competence '' . FSH may fundamental component final stage oocyte maturation . Evidence suggest exogenous ovarian stimulation follicle achieve equal vascularity , hence expose different amount FSH . We hypothesize FSH require , within follicle , time ovulation trigger oocyte maturation prevention atresia . The ovarian stimulation prior IVF attempt mimic , yet augment , normal physiology . The stimulation begin gonadotropin rescue antral follicle stimulate growth . Subsequently hCG , share 80 % homology LH , administer facilitate maturation oocyte . However , ovulatory phase normal menstrual cycle encompass concomitant LH FSH prior ovulation ( see figure ) . Maturation process whereby oocyte undergoes change preparation fertilization embryo development . This entails nuclear cytoplasmic transformation . Nuclear maturation pertains resumption meiosis metaphase II . It well establish LH surge intimately involved process . Although mechanism completely know , several step . It think germinal vesicle breakdown require burst calcium oscillation . During folliculogenesis , nuclear maturation oocyte normally tonic inhibition putative factor , oocyte-meiotic inhibitor ( OMI ) . Some evidence suggest , prior ovulation , LH inhibit release OMI either granulosa theca cell . OMI likely act paracrine factor increase cAMP production granulosa cell ( cumulus ) , act messenger oocyte maintain minimal calcium level . In addition , LH think decrease gap junction communication cumulus granulosa . Other evidence point putative signal synthesize granulosa cell , call follicular fluid meiotic activate substance . Both element involve nuclear maturation involve LH activity . The induction LH receptor via FSH . Under physiologic condition co-existent FSH surge LH surge . LH usually rise 10 fold baseline FSH rise roughly 4 fold baseline . It possible surge FSH ensure require amount LH receptor complete nuclear maturation . Cytoplasmic maturation difficult identify . The process entail synthesis new protein post-translational modification exist protein allow calcium activate pathway facilitate fertilization embryo development . It known extensive cross-talk oocyte granulosa cell . Few morphogenetic determinant cytoplasmic maturation identify , remain area intense investigation From clinical perspective , possible FSH require process nuclear and/or cytoplasmic maturation , minimal threshold FSH may require maintain gap junction completion oocyte development . This evidence may support in-vitro maturation study show FSH stimulatory effect cytoplasmic nuclear maturation . Oocyte degeneration ( atresia ) observe 5-15 % oocytes time , , intracytoplasmic sperm injection . The etiology degeneration determine . The fate oocyte likely determine prior oocyte retrieval . At time retrieval , apoptotic process oocyte destine undergo atresia probably already initiate . Under physiologic condition , granulosa cell die prior oocyte . There evidence atretic follicle high androgen estrogen ratio . It likely indication deteriorate health granulosa cell . It known FSH potent anti-apoptotic activity ( inhibition atresia ) , mechanism may indirect via estradiol production . There evidence FSH prim follicle grow LH administration , spite low FSH level . However , observation show process favor large follicle small follicle critical ratio FSH activity LH activity need survival . In support theory , others suggest narrow therapeutic window LH . If E2 production adequate , LH may detrimental follicle . The LH surge might hasten process , follicle relative lack vascularity ( and/or lack maturity ) , massive development androgen relative lack aromatase activity .</detailed_description>
