	<brief_title>Dose Optimisation Study ART621 Subjects Diagnosed With Rheumatoid Arthritis Taking Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite effective approximately 60 % subject , limitation exist anti-TNF therapy especially relation immunogenicity , safety administration . In addition , due high molecular weight , currently market product largely confine blood stream . ART621 anti-TNF molecule contain 2 identical domain `` antibody '' bind activity full antibody substantially small molecular size . The molecular weight approximately half full size antibody predict , ) improve tissue penetration , b ) less immunogenic full size antibody . This clinical trial design establish optimal dose level dose frequency ART621 treatment patient rheumatoid arthritis obtain data relate safety , immunogenicity pharmacokinetics ART621 administer intravenous load dose follow subcutaneous administration every week compare every fortnight .</detailed_description>

Subjects previously fail respond oral injectable antiTNFα therapy subject stop antiTNFα therapy safety reason . Subjects successfully respond antiTNF therapy past ( discontinue reason safety lack efficacy ) &gt; 6 month prior study day one may enrol . Patients participate previous antiTNF therapy study eligible confirm received placebo . Subjects previously receive following antirheumatic drug : interleukin1 receptor antagonist [ anakinra ] , rituximab , antiCD4 antibody , abatacept , thalidomide , p38 MAP kinase inhibitor agent ( list Section 7.3 ) .
