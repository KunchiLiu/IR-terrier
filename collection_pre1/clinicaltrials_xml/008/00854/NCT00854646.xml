	<brief_summary>This open-label , Phase I study determine high amount study drug , ON 01910.Na , safety give patient high risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) refractory leukemia . Patients receive ON 01910.Na ( start dose 650 mg/m2 ) intravenously 3-day continuous infusion every 2 week . Successive course use long infusion time and/or high dos drug toxicity , effectiveness , ineffectiveness recognize . In addition , amount drug blood measure , antitumor activity document , biological effect ON 01910.Na cell-cycle pathway evaluate peripheral blood mononuclear cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients must histologically document cytologically confirm diagnosis acute myelocytic leukemia refractory standard induction treatment , relapse standard therapy ; acute lymphocytic leukemia refractory induction treatment , relapse effective therapy ; chronic myelocytic leukemia refractory imatinib therapy second line tyrosine kinase inhibition , relapse tyrosine kinase inhibition , chronic , accelerate , blastic phase ; chronic lymphocytic leukemia refractory standard therapy , relapse second relapse ; myelodysplastic syndrome ( include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ) refractory azacitidine ; int-2 high myelodysplastic syndrome relapse hypomethylating agent . Patients may eligible , must decline , bone marrow transplantation chemotherapeutic regimen know produce consistent remission . Because hematopoietic criterion leukemia lymphoma confound nature disease , hematologic exclusion treatment . If leukopenia clinically determine attributable prior treatment , ON 01910.Na treatment may start leukocyte count increase two successive determination perform least three day apart . Thrombocytopenia criterion , patient support platelet transfusion clinically necessary . In absence leukopenia , fail prior treatment may succeed immediately entry study ON 01910.Na leukocyte count stable rising , two successive determination perform least three day apart , absence drug toxicity . The patient population involve approximately 12 28 patient ≥ 18 year age dose escalation portion protocol . All patient must relapse refractory leukemia poor risk MDS ( i.e. , int-2 high risk MDS fail standard therapy ) . They must candidate know regimen protocol treatment higher efficacy priority . Patients relapsed/refractory leukemia poor risk MDS must ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 . Patients must expect survival , opinion Investigator , allow sufficient observation period evaluate ON 01910.Na , meet eligibility criterion patient leukemia poor risk MDS . After maximally tolerate dose Recommended Phase II Dose ( RPTD ) duration determine , 12 additional patient histologically document cytologically confirm leukemia poor risk MDS add confirm appropriateness RPTD . Inclusion criterion dose confirmation phase similar dose escalation phase study , ECOG Performance Status must 0 1 . Safety data , include laboratory parameter adverse event , collect patient order determine qualitative quantitative toxicity , reversibility toxicity , ON 01910.Na . Leukemic cell MDS cell peripheral blood measure daily basis infusion , least two time weekly follow week . If leukemic cell disappear blood blood count improve define IWG criterion MDS patient , bone marrow aspiration perform determine response status bone marrow . All patient may continue therapy least six cycle unless rapid disease progression document . Patients objective clinical response stable disease continue six cycle . Further continuation determine clinical judgment Investigator .</detailed_description>

Patients may eligible , must decline , bone marrow transplantation chemotherapeutic regimen know produce consistent remission . There hematologic exclusion treatment . Patients prior radiotherapy eligible unless leukopenia ascribe prior radiation treatment , entry study ON 01910.Na may initiate two successive leukocyte count rise . ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 patient dose escalation phase 0 1 patient dose escalation phase . Patients may hematologic parameter without regard number provide transfusional support available Investigator stipulate leukopenia attributable disease rather prior therapy . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL , unless patient active hemolysis , elevation secondary ineffective erythropoiesis . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL , calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) study . If woman become pregnant suspect pregnant study , treat physician inform immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients positive blood culture afebrile 3 day antibiotic therapy continue . Patients leukopenia attribute prior chemotherapy two successive leukocyte count increase . Patients rapidly rise WBC ( e.g . &gt; 50 % increase previous day 3 consecutive day ) WBC &gt; 40 x 109/L . Patients continue toxicity hematologic prior therapy resolve grade 1 less compromise ON 01910.Na administration . Patients receive investigational agent concurrent chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy . Patients receive corticosteroid colonystimulating factor may continue treatment . These agent introduce previously employ . Patients know meningeal infiltration may include clinical trial intrathecal therapy and/or radiation complete , cerebrospinal fluid cytology improve . Patients history allergic reaction attributable compound similar chemical biologic composition ON 01910.Na . Patients major third space fluid accumulation , ascites require active medical management include paracentesis , peripheral bilateral edema , hyponatremia ( serum sodium value le 134 Meq/L ) . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited uncontrolled ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
