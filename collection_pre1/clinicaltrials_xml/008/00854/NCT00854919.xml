	<detailed_description>More recently , second-generation atypical antipsychotic drug ( AAPD ) modulate 5-HT DA function , risperidone ( RIS ) , olanzapine ( OLZ ) quetiapine ( QET ) , find effective augmentation SSRIs treatment-resistant OCD . Nevertheless , AAPDs associate common serious adverse effect , body weight ( BW ) gain metabolic dysregulation . Metabolic dysregulation include glucoregulatory dysfunction dyslipidemia . Indeed , study AAPD SSRI-refractory OCD patient similarly report significant BW gain . AAPD-induced BW gain may influence patient ' adherence medication place risk broad range medical problem . Most work AAPDs treatment-refractory OCD conduct form short-term efficacy study . There few study effectiveness , safety , tolerability agent context clinic CBT also provide , treatment continue significant period time . In current effectiveness study , seek examine response SSRI-refractory patient augmentation AAPDs , compare adverse event compare control group SSRI responder .</detailed_description>
