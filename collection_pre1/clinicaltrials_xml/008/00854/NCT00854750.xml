	<detailed_description>A quantum leap forward understand MS pathophysiology provide discovery myelin Louis Ranvier 1878 , Pierre Marie first suggest 1892 demyelination represent critical element MS pathology.1 In 1925 Lord Edgar Douglas Adrian report first electrical recording nerve transmission.2 Ultimately six Nobel prize award contribution directly relate characterization nerve impulse role play myelin , monumental achievement modern biology . While work University Otago New Zealand , Dr. W. Ian McDonald ( pass away December 13 , 2006 ) first provide objective evidence demyelination MS associate correspond change transmission electrically cod message within nerve axons.3-5 He note disruption myelin lead reduction axonal cross sectional area thereby reduction conduction velocity , loss saltatory conduction , predilection conduction block . Understanding conspicuous aspect MS pathophysiology allow u predict many reversible symptom describe patient , particularly provoke intensify elevated ambient core body temperature , exercise , infection . Such process appear compromise safety threshold high fidelity nerve transmission . This phenomenon also recognize clinically Wilhelm Uhthoff 1899 , evaluate optic neuritis patient experience reversible stereotypic alteration vision exercise exposure heat.6 MS exacerbation ( via inflammation , edema , demyelination ) sustain progression disability ( via gliosis , sustain demyelination , neurodegeneration ) represent formidable challenge disease process partially yield series disease modify therapeutic strategies.7 However , patient , bona fide exacerbation typically occur infrequently ( perhaps per year , even use treatment ) , disability progression take time ( many year ) . Alternately , fluctuation neuronal activity induce variety factor great frequency variability ( provoked minute , hour , day , week ) correspondingly result compromise functional capability vision , reading , drive , walk , work performance , cognitive processing , execution activity daily live . In essence , frequent , transient , typically stereotypic reversible physiologic change constitute major component MS related disability . Notwithstanding important achievement validate favorable effect disease modify agent MS , major recalcitrant challenge , forefront MS therapeutic , focus reduce consequence symptoms collateral disease process . Such symptom include fatigue , weakness , gait dysfunction , spasticity , heat intolerance , pain , cognitive change , sensory disturbance , bowel , bladder , sexual dysfunction , depression , hopelessness.8 While underpinnings complaint manifold , change axonal conduction mechanism represent well-recognized cardinal feature MS pathophysiology . A deep understanding novel intervention might serve enhance axonal 'safety factor ' thermal perturbation ( ambient , surface , core body temperature ) could lead identification new treatment strategy enhance physiologic performance CNS pathways involve organization physical intellectual capability . An important randomized control study systematically demonstrate long-term benefit acute chronic cooling objective well patient report measure neurologic function.9 It would important also understand active heating impact upon similar measure , whether preemptive cool protective response heat stress . We propose neuro-ophthalmologic hallmark MS , INO ( ocular motor syndrome ) optic neuritis ( visual sensory syndrome ) , study objective method ( infrared oculography VEPs respectively ) good understand factor provoke prevent reversible conduction change demyelinate axon , within highly discrete tract system whether specific drug treatment , ACTHAR Gel , mitigate heat induce worsen ocular motor anterior visual system dysfunction . Such study would appear germane development new treatment approach focus optimize fidelity axonal conduction demyelinate pathway , provide elusive outcome measure Phase II trial . Education effort inform patient health care provider pervasive nature thermally induce symptom MS ( potential impact daily activity ) , could lead effective strategy enhance performance safety . There paucity research education conspicuous important aspect MS impact upon patient , family , workplace .</detailed_description>
