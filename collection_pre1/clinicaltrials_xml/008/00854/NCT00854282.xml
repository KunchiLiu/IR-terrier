	<brief_summary>Cancer lead cause mortality country , ovarian cancer become important disease gradually field gynecologic malignancy . According statistic Department Health , incidence ovarian cancer increase recent year mortality rate high among gynecologic malignancy Taiwan . Early diagnosis ovarian cancer difficult due lack obvious specific initial symptom . Therefore , usually advanced stage diagnosis confirm . The prognostic parameter ovarian cancer include tumor stage , histological subtype grade , residual tumor surgical intervention response chemotherapy . However , possible mechanism ovarian cancer still clear , considerable influence management prognosis patient . Malignancy consider multi-factorial disease , influence immunologic mechanism progression prognosis cancer important . The natural CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cell actively suppress pathologic physiological immune response , contribute maintenance immunological self-tolerance immune homeostasis . The development function regulatory T cell depend expression transcription factor forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3 ) . The mechanisms suppression still know well . Whatever mechanisms suppression , necessary control magnitude regulatory T cells-mediated suppression benefit host much suppression might lead immunosuppression render host susceptible infection cancer . We collect tumor tissue , ascites peripheral blood operation . Through research set immunological profile change lymphocyte , humoral immunity cell-mediated immunity ovarian cancer patient . The kinetic change association regulatory T cell severity progression disease also evaluate . Therefore , role regulatory T cell would define patient ovarian cancer . We also correlate regulatory T cell clinical prognosis ovarian cancer patient . Finally , try find efficient therapeutic strategy cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : All patient receive four six course adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy.Histologic grade accord International Union Cancer criterion ( 28 ) . The stage disease classify accord International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ( FIGO , 1987 ) . Pelvic paraaortic lymph node sampling perform , disease confine within ovary without ruptured capsule . The histopathologic data , include histologic type histologic grade , evaluate certified pathologist . The maximal diameter residual tumor surgery also record . All patient follow 3-month interval .</detailed_description>
