	<brief_summary>The primary goal study validate design ElectroCore RMS-1100 Resolution Motility Systemâ„¢ ability safely place stimulation electrode epidural space spine post-operative subject , evaluate subject 's ability tolerate stimulation 48 hour . The secondary goal confirm electrical signal deliver via electrode show evidence effectiveness improve functional GI motility subject experience post-operative paralytic ileus</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate effect neurostimulation epidural space spine activity enteric nervous system ( ENS ) . ElectroCore successfully study POI animal model believe temporary neurostimulation spine may useful re-starting ENS human , result resumption coherent GI motility gut normal bowel function short period time currently occur . Electrical pulse use modulate signal may prevent return normal GI activity . This device procedure use study similar system procedure use implant temporary trial stimulator use evaluate effectiveness spine pain stimulation prior implantation permanent device .</detailed_description>
