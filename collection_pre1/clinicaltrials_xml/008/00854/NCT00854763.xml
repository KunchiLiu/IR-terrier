	<detailed_description>Vitamin D play important role cardiac function blood pressure regulation , serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration change important indicator Vitamin D nutritional status , serum 1,25 ( OH ) 2D active hormone biological action . However , little known change vitamin D concentration relate usage angiotensin receptor blocker among patient hypertension . We conduct open label , non-comparative , observational study evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability Olmesartan therapy Taiwan patient essential hypertension , primary objective change 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure baseline day post-treatment week-12 visit accord ambulatory blood pressure monitoring . Our second endpoint include : 1 . Change 24-hour mean diastolic blood pressure baseline day post-treatment week-12 visit 2 . To evaluate reduction office blood pressure , include SeSBP SeDPB , Olmesartan 20mg therapy 4,8,12 week ( subject week-4 , week-8 visit ) 3 . Control rate [ % patient ] 12weeks , define Defined SBP le 140mmHg / DBP le 90mmHg reduction 10 mmHg DBP / 20mmHg SBP versus baseline value 4 . Biomarker assessment Vitamin D change baseline 24-hour urinary sodium excretion change baseline 5 . To evaluate efficacy tolerability Olmesartan 20mg 12 week base global assessment physician patient The major aim proposal investigate effect angiotensin receptor blocker , Olmesartan , 12 week ' treatment among patient hypertension outpatient clinic one hospital center . We set blood pressure measure ambulatory blood pressure monitor primary endpoint . Furthermore , test Vitamin D relate concentration 24 hour urine sodium excretion change blood pressure change . We recruit 200 patient hypertension observational study evaluate efficacy safety issue among patient . The specific aim proposal include : 1 . Test improvement blood pressure change 24-hour blood pressure monitor angiotensin receptor blocker , Olmesartan , among hypertensive patient 2 . Test change vitamin D concentration 24-hour urinary sodium excretion change angiotensin receptor blocker , Olmesartan , treatment 3 . Test association blood pressure change vitamin D-related measurement among drug treatment , We hypothesize blood pressure change relate change serum vitamin D concentration also related urinary sodium excretion change . . The unique feature proposal include well-designed observational study experience clinician epidemiologist conduct study . Under infrastructure tertiary hospital center , participant compliance , follow , quality control outcomes measurement assure monitored guideline good clinical practice . Furthermore , investigator expert vitamin D associate measurement biomarkers study clinical setting . This proposal provide important scientific knowledge relationship among blood pressure change , vitamin D urinary sodium excretion among hypertensive patient 12 week ' angiotensin receptor blocker treatment Taiwan .</detailed_description>
