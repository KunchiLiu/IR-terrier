	<brief_summary>This multicenter study evaluate effectiveness nonoperative operative treatment . The investigator wish identify important clinical radiographic determinant outcome management adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis ( ASLS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter Prospective Study Quality Life Adult Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim # 1 : Compare outcomes surgery nonoperative treatment patient age 40 80 ASLS define lumbar curve coronal Cobb measurement ≥ 30° , either follow : Oswestry ( ODI ) score 20 ; Scoliosis Research Society Quality Life instrument ( SRS-QOL ) score 4.0 less , domains pain , function and/or appearance . Specific Aim # 2 : Evaluate impact patient factor ( age , gender , socioeconomic status , education ) comorbidities [ mental health , body mass index ( BMI ) bone mineral density ( BMD ) ] adverse event treatment outcomes nonoperative operative arm . Incorporate variable prediction model help identify patient likely benefit either surgical nonoperative approach</detailed_description>
