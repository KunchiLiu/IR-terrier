	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy safety ON 01910.Na Concentrate administer intravenous continuous infusion ( IVCI ) 72 hour every 2 week broad population MDS patient . Rationale study base activity observe another study ON 01910.Na patient refractory anemia excess blast ( RAEB ) 1 2 MDS . This study examine ON 01910.Na broad population MDS AML patient . This phase I/II study establish Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) start dose 800 mg/m2 per day administer 24 hour 2 consecutive day continuous intravenous infusion , week 3 week 4-week cycle examine efficacy safety profile MTD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study 72-Hour Infusion ON 01910.Na Patients With MDS AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy safety ON 01910.Na CIV 24-hour infusion administer three time week every week achieve week 25 complete partial response define per 2000 International Working Group ( IWG ) Criteria patient MDS define Cheson et al . [ JCO 21:4642 ( 2003 ) ] patient AML . The secondary objective ass : - Time duration response - Blastic response bone marrow - Improvement dyspoiesis evaluate change aneuploidy bone marrow - Change International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) MDS patient - Major minor response absolute neutrophil count , accord IWG 2000 criterion - Major minor response platelet count , accord IWG 2000 criterion - Major minor erythroid response , accord IWG 2000 criterion - Time progression - Overall survival 25 50 week - Proportion MDS patient transition acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) 25 50 week This phase 1/2 single arm study six thirty-five patient MDS AML meet inclusion/exclusion criterion receive ON 01910.Na intravenous continuous infusion ( IVCI ) 72 hour week every week . In phase 1 portion study , traditional dose escalation rule , also know `` 3+3 '' rule , use . Three patient treat 800 mg/m2/day dose level . If none patient experience DLT cycle 1 , next group 3 patient receive 1500 mg/m2/day . If DLT see 1500 mg/m2/day dose level , dose use phase 2 portion study 1500 mg/m2/day . If DLT one first three patient 800 mg/m2/day dose level , dose level expand 6 patient . If ≤ 1 patient 6 experience DLT , dose escalated 1500 mg/m2/day dose level . If ≥ 2 patient experience DLT 800 mg/m2/day dose level , full safety review determine enrollment patient proceed . If DLT one first three patient 1500 mg/m2/day dose level , dose level expand 6 patient . If ≤ 1 patient 6 experience DLT 1500 mg/m2/day dose level , 1500 mg/m2/day dose level consider MTD . If ≥ 2 patient experience DLT 1500 mg/m2/day dose level , 800 mg/m2/day designate MTD . The total study duration 29 week , include 2-week screening phase , 23-week dosing phase , 4-week follow-up phase begin last dose ON 01910.Na . Beginning week 4 , every 2 week thereafter , patient assess response follow . Patients achieve week 25 complete partial response stabilization disease eligible receive additional 24 week ON 01910.Na 1800 mg/24 h 72 h week every 2 week follow .</detailed_description>
