	<brief_summary>Platelets major component clot formation lead clot event heart attack . During treatment heart attack , doctor try remove blockage quickly possible heart recover start work properly . The standard care Heart Institute patient heart attack procedure call Percutaneous Coronary Angioplasty . A drug call Clopidogrel ( Plavix ) routinely use prior angioplasty prevent blood clot . Patients usually remain Clopidogrel least one year follow angioplasty . Clopidogrel work prevent blood form sticky substance call platelet , clump together form clot . Despite routine use Clopidogrel , patient still return hospital another heart attack , chest pain . There grow body evidence recurrence complication may attribute patient poor response Clopidogrel . This pilot study examine platelet react different dos Clopidogrel give patient heart attack .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Function Monitoring Patients Treated With Clopidogrel Time Primary Percutaneous Coronary Angioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platelets major component clot formation lead thrombotic event . Antiplatelet agent find reduce cardiovascular event different clinical setting . The commonest agent use aspirin work inhibit cyclooxygenase pathway within platelet consequently prevent release tromboxane A2 . A second group agent call thienopyridines inhibit platelet block P2Y12 receptor . Clopidogrel ( Plavix ) currently widely use thienopyridine use treatment patient present acute coronary syndrome patient undergo percutaneous coronary angioplasty ( PCI ) . Antiplatelet therapy reduce occurrence thrombotic event follow PCI , include myocardial infarction stent thrombosis . However , despite dual therapy aspirin clopidogrel , significant number patient continue experience cardiovascular event . There grow body evidence recurrence ischemic complication may attribute poor response clopidogrel persistence enhance platelet reactivity despite use clopidogrel believe clinically relevant.1 The mechanism lead poor clopidogrel effect fully explain . Our pilot study use VerifyNow device ex vivo method measure platelet inhibition patient treat clopidogrel set STEMI . Since July 2004 , standard care University Ottawa Heart Institute treatment STEMI primary PCI patient receive aspirin 160 mg po either field arrival emergency department clopidogrel 600 mg po give arrival hospital . Little known pharmacokinetics clopidogrel set STEMI . Clopidogrel must absorb activate liver effective . The physiological mechanism step may greatly disturb patient present STEMI . Therefore , purpose study examine degree platelet inhibition various time point select patient population use current 600 mg dose clopidogrel compare dose dos clopidogrel determine optimal load dose context STEMI .</detailed_description>
