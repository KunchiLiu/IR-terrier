	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Irinotecan Treatment Resistant Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer KRAS Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy resistance major challenge metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) , EGFR inhibitor introduce 3rd line treatment chemotherapy refractory patient . However , recently establish response treatment irinotecan cetuximab confine patient wtKRAS tumor . Therefore , downstream target propose potential inhibitor EGFR signal tumour KRAS mutation . mTOR central intracellular signalling molecule rational approach potential reversion chemotherapy resistance patient . Preclinical data suggest different solid tumor could respond mTOR inhibitor report enhance antitumor activity combination different traditional cytostatic drug . Furthermore recent preclinical data suggest mTOR inhibition may induce tumor reduction colon cancer xenographs . Temsirolimus ( CCI-779 ) widely investigate different clinical setting presently register treatment renal cell carcinoma . Furthermore , recently show response metastatic breast cancer patient , present clinical data efficacy safety metastatic colorectal cancer patient . The present study aim investigate safety efficacy monotherapy temsirolimus combination temsirolimus irinotecan chemotherapy resistant , KRAS mutate colorectal adenocarcinoma .</detailed_description>
