	<brief_summary>Rationale : DCC-2036 potent broad spectrum inhibitor BCR-ABL kinase . Inhibition BCR-ABL validate effective treatment chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . The emergence mutant form BCR-ABL resist inhibition imatinib , dasatinib , nilotinib associate loss efficacy treatment disease . DCC-2036 potent inhibitor resistant mutant BCR-ABL include T315I mutation , would therefore expect effectively treat patient fail respond BCR-ABL inhibitor . DCC-2036 also inhibit FLT3-ITD , TIE2 , KDR , LYN TRKA kinases . Purpose : ass safety tolerability patient continuous administration DCC-2036 determine recommend dos conduct Phase 2 efficacy trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Safety Preliminary Efficacy DCC-2036 Patients With Leukemias ( Ph+ CML With T315I Mutation )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study include patient one following : ( 1 ) Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) ; ( 2 ) FLT3 ( gene ) internal tandem duplication positive acute myeloid leukemia [ FLT3 ( gene ) ITD-AML ] . The investigational drug DCC-2036 show laboratory affect different kind proteins CML AML cancer cell , may help stop cancer cell grow . This Phase 1 study . This Phase 1 study test high safe dose investigational drug , DCC-2036 , often drug give , well Ph+ CML AML patient tolerate DCC-2036 . Patients ' study doctor review past medical history , surgery ( ) , know allergy , past/current medication . In addition , blood test bone marrow biopsy take determine person eligible participate study . During first part study , patient receive different amount DCC-2036 determine high safe dose . Multiple dose level DCC-2036 test long medically unacceptable side effect note , dose increased next group study patient . When high dose reach , large number patient enrol receive DCC-2036 high ( safe ) dose level . Additional study patient enrol group call `` Expansion Group '' receive study drug high well tolerate dose . Evaluation safety efficacy ( well study medication treat leukemia ) study trial . Disease assessment monitor follow : ( 1 ) Blood sample collect disease response mutational analysis disease gotten bad ( progress ) ; ( 2 ) Bone marrow sample may collect area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow drawn needle ; ( 3 ) For CML patient , blood sample collect BCR-ABL transcript level . Patient safety primary importance Phase 1 study . Safety assessment monitor follow : ( 1 ) Physical examination perform regularly doctor 's visit ; ( 2 ) Routine blood test perform regular basis ass potential side effect may cause study medication different organ like ( limited ) liver , kidney bone marrow ; ( 3 ) Based report potential side effect heart may cause study medication , patient require echocardiograms blood draws measure level serum N-terminal fragment pro B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) . An echocardiogram noninvasive test use sound wave produce image heart . These image tell doctor patient 's heart beating pumping . The NT-proBNP blood test help patient 's doctor evaluate well heart work . After initial testing complete , patient require safety evaluation perform interval 3-cycles ( approximately every 3 month ) long take study medication . Patients experience muscle weakness peripheral neuropathy assess blood draw measure creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) level . Measuring CPK level may help patient 's doctor determine whether symptom experience result muscle damage due cause . The common eye disorder include blurred vision , dry eye , visual impairment . Patients require complete eye ( ophthalmologic ) evaluation . After initial ophthalmologic exam , patient require exam completion every 3 cycle study medication ( approximately every 3 month ) time stop take study medication . Blood sample collect pharmacokinetic analysis . Pharmacokinetics study bodily absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug . Blood sample also collect pharmacodynamic analysis . Pharmacodynamic analysis measure biomarkers either protein gene ( also call DNA ) associate disease may also relate respond treatment type side effect may happen . The investigational drug DCC-2036 approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The FDA allow DCC-2036 use research study . DCC-2036 give patient study study .</detailed_description>
