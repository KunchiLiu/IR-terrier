	<brief_title>Double Randomization Monitoring Adjusted Antiplatelet Treatment Versus Common Antiplatelet Treatment DES Implantation , Interruption Versus Continuation Double Antiplatelet Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participating Centers : 38 french high PCI volume ( &gt; 700 ) center Rationale : Clopidogrel / Prasugrel ( 75 mg/day ) , combination aspirin ( 75 mg/day ) , currently antiplatelet treatment choice prevention stent thrombosis , clinical trial show , high-risk patient , prolong dual antiplatelet treatment effective aspirin alone prevent major cardiovascular event . However , despite use clopidogrel , considerable number patient continue cardiovascular event . Numerous VITRO study show individual responsiveness clopidogrel also aspirin uniform patient subject inter- intraindividual variability . The recent possibility bedside monitor oral antiplatelet therapy offer unique opportunity tailor antiplatelet therapy . However , relevance strategy never evaluate randomized prospective adequately power study long term follow-up ( rationale 1 ) . Late state stent thrombosis , especially era drug elute stent interruption OAT , another important safety issue raise question modality interruption dual OAT one year accord recent updated recommendation . Can switch dual single OAT one year ? If , ischemic hazard ? ( Rational 2 ) Our first hypothesis strategy dose adjustment OAT base biological monitoring reduces rate combine ischemic endpoint death , urgent revascularization , stent thrombosis stroke compare conventional strategy ( local practice without monitor ) patient schedule DES implantation follow one year . Our second hypothesis interruption clopidogrel one year dual OAT associate high rate combine ischemic endpoint compare patient dual OAT maintain subsequent 6 month follow-up . Objectives : 1 ) To demonstrate superiority strategy monitor dose adjustment suboptimal responder ( Monitoring Arm ) compare conventional strategy ( Conventional Arm ) fix dose regimen oral antiplatelet agent patient define international guideline reduce primary endpoint evaluate one year DES implantation . 2 ) demonstrate superiority strategy pursuit dual OAT beyond one year ( Pursuit Arm ) compare strategy interruption ( Interruption Arm ) . Duration participation : 18 30 month accord time delay study start randomization . No participant exclude study exception consent withdrawal . However , participant randomize interruption continuation DAPT 12 month follow visit terminate study Number patient : 2500 patient . This number obtain demonstration superiority strategy monitoring ( Monitoring Arm ) conventional strategy ( Conventional Arm ) reduce primary endpoint 33 % ( relative risk reduction ) . Expected result : The ARCTIC study provide answer two major clinical challenge . It also give unique opportunity ass prevalence associate risk factor suboptimal answer OAT , also improve suboptimal biological response . Finally , economic impact strategy monitor interruption evaluate .</detailed_description>
