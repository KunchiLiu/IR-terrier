	<brief_title>The Clinical Evaluation Dose Erythropoietins Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase III pragmatic , randomized-controlled trial compare different dos ESAs patient renal anaemia . Study Sample : Total 900 participant Italy Background Rationale : Anaemia risk factor death , cardiac-cerebrovascular event poor quality life patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents ( ESA ) use treatment option . In observational study higher haemoglobin ( Hb ) level ( around 10-13 g/dL ) associate improved survival quality life compare low Hb level ( around 9 g/dL ) . Randomized study find high Hb target , achieve maintain ESA , cause increase risk death , mainly due adverse cardiac-cerebrovascular outcome . It possible effect mediate ESA dose . This hypothesis formally test aim Clinical Evaluation DOSe Erythropoietins ( CEDOSE ) trial . CEDOSE first independent multicentre trial explore benefit harm different ESA dose therapeutic strategy management anaemia end stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) . Hypothesis : ESA resistance associate adverse vascular outcome poor quality life ESKD . The CEDOSE trial evaluate biochemical marker determine efficacy individual prediction ESAs therapy ; moreover evaluate benefit harm two fixed ESA dose explore role two treatment strategy , one base low one base high ESA dose . Interventions Comparison : Patients randomize 1:1 4000 IU/week iv . versus 18000 IU/week iv . epoetin alfa , beta epoetin equivalent dos .</detailed_description>
