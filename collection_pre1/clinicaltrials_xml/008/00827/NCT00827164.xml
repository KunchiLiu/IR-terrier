	<brief_title>Resistance Training During Radiation Therapy Pharyngeal Laryngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck cancer ( HNCa ) patient often lose significant body weight lean mass associate high mortality , great fatigue , poor quality life , reduce physical functioning . Because nutritional supplementation may consistently improve lean body mass , resistance training may beneficial . HNCa patient experience unique side effect impact nutritional status , limit generalization exercise intervention study result cancer type HNCa patient . Therefore , 44 HNCa patient enrol randomize control trial follow study aim : Primary study aim : Because pilot proposal among first attempt randomize control exercise trial HNCa patient , primary study aim examines feasibility ( e.g. , study acceptance , recruitment , intervention process evaluation , adherence , adverse event , retention ) . The investigator hypothesize study procedure require minor alteration future study . Secondary study aim # 1 : Because effect size necessary plan efficacy trial , proposal compare effect 12-week resistance training plus nutritional counseling intervention versus nutritional counsel alone muscle strength , lean body mass , physical functioning , fatigue , quality life HNCa patient receive radiation without chemotherapy . The investigator hypothesize patient receive resistance train nutritional counseling demonstrate great improvement outcome compare participant receive nutritional counseling alone . Secondary study aim # 2 : To enhance adherence future intervention trial , proposal determine resistance train nutritional adherence rate associated factor among HNCa patient use attendance record , exercise log , diet record , self-administered survey , medical record review . The investigator hypothesize adherence rate low cancer population correlate include demographic , medical , psychosocial factor . Assessments occur baseline ( first week radiation ) , week 6 ( mid-intervention ) , week 12 ( post-intervention ) . Qualitative quantitative ( e.g. , rate , 95 % confidence interval ) assess feasibility mixed model ANOVA examine group difference . This information critical design future resistance training efficacy trial HNCa patient prevent lean body mass loss HNCa patient , potentially reduce mortality , minimize fatigue , improve physical functioning quality life .</detailed_description>
