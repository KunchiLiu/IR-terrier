	<brief_summary>The hypothesis clinical research study discover study drug RAD001 shrink slow growth Estrogen Receptor/Progesterone Receptor ( ER/PR ) negative Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 ( Her2 Neu ) negative breast cancer . The safety RAD001 also study . Patients physical state , symptom , change size tumor , laboratory finding obtain on-study help research team decide RAD001 safe effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial RAD001 Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RAD001 orally administer cell cycle inhibitor antitumor activity . RAD001 , like Rapamycin , bind high affinity intracellular immunophilin , FKBP12 complex specifically interact mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) protein kinase , inhibit downstream event initiation mRNA translation . RAD001 inhibit growth wide range histologically diverse tumor cell . RAD001 develop cytostatic agent delay time tumor recurrence/progression increase survival patient various malignancy . The compound good tolerability , partially discover mechanism action . RAD001 ability arrest cell G1 phase , ability induce apoptosis . RAD001 investigate anticancer agent base potential act directly tumor cell inhibit tumor cell growth proliferation possible inhibition PI3/AKT/MTOR pathway . RAD001 show activity human tumor cell line originate lung , breast , prostate , colon , kidney , melanoma glioblastoma . RAD001 also show activity human pancreatic neuroendocrine cell , induction apoptosis report , well acute myeloid leukemia cell , adult T-cell leukemia cell , diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell , pancreatic tumor cell , ovarian cancer cell , hepatocellular carcinoma cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 Age ≥ 18 year At least one measurable site disease accord RECIST criterion previously irradiate . If patient previous radiation marker lesion ( ) , must evidence disease progression since radiation Adequate bone marrow function show : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ( PLT ) ≥ 100 x 109/L , Hemoglobin ( HGB ) ≥9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , Prothrombin Time ( INR ) ≤ 1.3 ( ≤ 3 anticoagulant ) , Liver function teat ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN patient liver metastasis ) Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Controlled diabetes define fast serum glucose ≤1.5 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , antibody base therapy , etc . ) Palliative radiation therapy allow localize area ( ie : painful rib lesion ) , discretion PI treat radiation oncologist Major surgery/significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug . Not recovered side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) Grade I patient may require major surgery course study . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week Receiving chronic immunosuppressive agent , except corticosteroid daily dosage equivalent prednisone ≤ 20 milligram ( mg ) . However , patient receive corticosteroid must stable dosage regimen minimum 4 week prior first treatment RAD001 . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . May receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period . Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastases Other malignancy within past 3 year , except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Congestive heart failure : New York Heart Association Class III/IV , Unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease . Impaired lung function ( PFT screen baseline ) define spirometry DLCO 50 % normal predict value and/or 02 saturation 88 % less rest room air . Uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose ≥1.5 x ULN . Glucose control achieve start patient RAD001 . Active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection Liver disease ( cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis ) Known history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) seropositivity Impairment gastrointestinal function/disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Active , bleed diathesis Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . Prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Known hypersensitivity RAD001 ( everolimus ) rapamycin drug ( sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients</criteria>
