	<brief_summary>The major purpose study determine new drug call pazopanib decrease lymphedema subject previously treat cancer . Lymphedema , swell arm , result damage lymphatic vessel arm surgery and/or radiation . The damage vessel adequately drain fluid arm , result increased pressure swell . Pazopanib previously study treatment lymphedema .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) Inhibition Patients With Unilateral Upper Extremity Lymphedema Following Treatment Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pazopanib inhibit growth blood vessel tumor inhibit protein call vascular endothelial growth factor ( commonly call VEGF ) . Pazopanib currently approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) therefore consider experimental medication . High level VEGF cause blood vessel leak fluid , increase pressure tumor similar increase pressure lymphedema . Previous study find treatment pazopanib decrease fluid pressure tumor . That think pazopanib might effective treatment lymphedema .</detailed_description>
