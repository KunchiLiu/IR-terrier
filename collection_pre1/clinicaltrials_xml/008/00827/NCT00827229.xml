	<brief_summary>A clinical study conduct demonstrate accuracy LaborPro System measure fetal head station ( pelvic inlet ) , cervical dilatation , fetal head position manual/digital examination . The LaborPro obtain device value compare measurement gather within 15 minute manual/digital examination perform two independent physician . The study non significant risk ( NSR ) device study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The purpose study evaluate accuracy LaborPro fetal head station , fetal head position , cervical dilatation measurement compare manual/digital examination demonstrate LaborPro System safe . Methods Procedures The study population include woman admit either Maimonides Medical Center ( NY , USA ) Bnai Zion Medical Center ( Haifa , Israel ) active phase labor , singleton pregnancy vertex presentation . One hundred ten ( 110 ) subject enrol study . Two subject exclude study one Bnai Zion Medical Center system malfunction ( PC failure ) one subject Maimonides Medical Center change mind refuse participate study . Sixty Seven ( 67 ) subject ( 62 % ) enrol Maimonides Medical Center forty one ( 41 ) subject ( 38 % ) enrol Bnai Zion Medical Center . Subject 's mean age 28.2 year ( range 15.8 year 39.5 ) . Each subject examine case first exam ( accord blind physician assessment ) early labor stage ( cervical dilatation &lt; 3 cm ) , second examination interval least 2 hour first one record . In case first examination perform advanced labor stage ( cervical dilatation &gt; 3 cm ) , second examination interval record least 1 hour first one . Each set examination ( LaborPro two independent practitioner ) station , position cervical dilatation complete within 15 minute . The two independent physician blind 's result LaborPro result . If labor duration enable examination , two three set test perform subject . During labor , attend physician , midwife nurse conduct manual trans-vaginal digital evaluation ( TVDEs ) accord standard practice respect frequency method . During manual TVDE , clinician use LaborPro finger sensor simultaneous LaborPro measurement fetal head station finger tip ( HSFT ) cervical dilatation ( CDFT ) record . A trained ultrasonographer ( physician , midwife technician ) also perform ultrasound examination yield LaborPro data measurement head position ( HP ) head station ( HSUS ) respect BPD vs. Pelvic Inlet respect fetal scalp tip vs. Pelvic Inlet . Study Endpoints Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint study average difference measurement Head Station ( HS ) Cervical Dilatation ( CD ) make device ( LaborPro ) TVDEs . Secondary Endpoint The secondary efficacy endpoint degree agreement Fetal Head Position ( HP ) measure LaborPro versus one measure TVDE . In summary , labor parameter measure LaborPro compare gold-standard physician ' assessment result accurate representation fetal head station ( calculate pelvic inlet ) , cervical dilatation , fetal head position . It therefore conclude LaborPro provide clinically statistically adequate estimate fetal head station ( calculate pelvic inlet ) , fetal head position , cervical dilatation . The safety profile LaborPro non invasive system also demonstrate non occurrence device relate adverse event .</detailed_description>
