	<brief_summary>Despite recent advance stent technology widespread application treatment peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) , incidences partial complete blockage stent lumen ( in-stent restenosis ) due growth cell ( neo-intimal proliferation ) unacceptably high . In diabetic long superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) lesion , in-stent restenosis rate higher non-diabetics . Consequently interventional technique curtail in-stent restenosis explore . Cryoplasty stent expansion method balloon expand use pressurize nitrous oxide gas . As nitrous oxide expands balloon cool surroundings -10 degree C. This induce program death ( apoptosis ) smooth muscle cell arterial wall . The investigator hypothesize Cryoplasty , induce apoptotic smooth muscle cell response , apply post-dilation nitinol self-expanding stent Superficial Femoral Artery ( SFA ) diabetic , would lead decreased in-stent restenosis due decrease neointimal proliferation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pre-recruitment process would identify diabetic life-style limit claudication leg . Based physician decision patient may undergo peripheral vascular intervention SFA , placement self-expanding nitinol stent . If decision make , patient randomize either cryoplasty balloon post-dilation stent conventional angioplasty balloon post-dilation obtain informed consent . At one year , segment ( stent + 10 mm beyond proximal distal edge ) peak systolic velocity duplex ultrasound measure subject assess rate binary restenosis define &gt; = 2.5 time increase peak systolic velocity ( primary endpoint ) . A 6 month rest ankle brachial index , binary restenosis may assess secondary endpoint study .</detailed_description>
