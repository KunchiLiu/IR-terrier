	<brief_summary>Chronically disabled stroke survivor experience accelerate skeletal muscle atrophy detrimental change muscle surround tissue paretic side . This unilateral tissue-level damage contributes worsen disability insulin resistance . This VA Merit Award advance investigator ' understand potential strength training ( ST ) reverse stroke-related muscle abnormality improve metabolic health , strength , function . It first study thoroughly investigate effect ST muscle atrophy , intramuscular fat , muscle fiber characteristic , capillary density insulin sensitivity stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study investigate hypothesis novel , high intensity , high repetition ST program improve abnormalities paretic non-paretic leg muscle volume composition compare attention-matched control regimen supervise stretch 3-month intervention period disable stroke . The investigator hypothesize ST-induced skeletal muscle adaptation translate improve insulin sensitivity , strength , function population . The specific objective : 1 ) Determine effect ST compare control intervention paretic non-paretic abnormality skeletal muscle volume , intramuscular fat , muscle fiber distribution , muscle capillary density , muscle inflammation chronically disable stroke survivor . 2 ) Determine effect ST compare control intervention insulin sensitivity stroke survivor , whether structural cellular skeletal muscle mechanism contribute improvement insulin sensitivity ST. 3 ) Determine effect ST compare control intervention physical function ( strength , walk speed balance ) stroke survivor , whether structural skeletal muscle mechanism predict ST-induced functional improvement . The project design consist 4 phase 5 month stroke participant enrol either two intervention arm ( ST vs. CONTROL ) . During phase 1 investigator screen consent chronic stroke patient residual gait deficit . Phase 2 ( 3 week ) consist baseline test include dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scanning , bilateral CT scan leg , bilateral vastus lateralis muscle biopsy , strength testing , time walk , balance measurement , oral glucose tolerance testing , hyperglycemic clamp test . Following completion baseline testing , volunteer randomize ST CONTROL group . Phase 3 ( Intervention Phase , 3 month ) begin 2 session acclimatization assign ST group . ST progress 2 set 20 repetition leg machine ( Keiser Leg Press , Leg Extension , Leg Curl ) gradual increase resistance 3 month . Those CONTROL group receive equal exposure health care personnel Baltimore VA Exercise facility , perform full battery upper low body passive active stretching exercise intervention session . In Phase 4 baseline test laboratory analysis repeat . Developing evidence-based therapy combat skeletal muscle deterioration highly relevant chronically disabled stoke survivor . There mount evidence current model post-stroke rehabilitation optimal maximize recovery muscle mass , strength , metabolic health . The propose research develop new insight utility progressive ST reverse detrimental change gross muscle composition , muscle molecular phenotype , muscle inflammation , muscle capillarization . Changes muscle parameter measurable impact whole body insulin sensitivity function . Collectively , result trial may change current standard care stroke survivor provide evidenced reason augment physical therapist ' treatment , allow intense diverse therapy session maintenance skeletal muscle .</detailed_description>
