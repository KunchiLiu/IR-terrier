	<detailed_description>For numerous malignant non-malignant hematological disease allogeneic hematoÂ¬poietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) curative therapy . One major complication occurrence acute graft-versus-host-disease ( aGVHD ) . Thirty eighty percent patient HSCT develop aGVHD despite prophylactic application different immunosuppressive drug depend risk factor HLA-match , donor relation , age etc.1-3 . First line therapy aGVHD &gt; grade I consist steroid dose 2 mg/kg . The response rate treatment 15-35 % 4 . In case steroid refractory aGVHD different therapeutic strategy evaluate , satisfactory result far . The mortality patient suffer steroid refractory aGVHD remain 75-80 % , although numerous study different treatment strategy conducted2-5 . Therefore , remain important search new therapeutical strategy treatment aGVHD . The first patient receive mismatch Mesenchymal Stem Cells twenty-year-old woman acute myeloid leukemia treat peripheral blood stem cell combine MSC haploidentical father . Lazarus et al . report 46 patient receive HSCs culture-expanded MSCs HLA-identical sibling . Moderate severe acute GvHD observe 28 % patient , chronic GvHD see 61 % . The two-year progression-free survival observe 53 % patient . MSC infusion cause acute long-term MSC-associated adverse event . Traditionally , MSC isolation expansion , fetal calf serum ( FCS ) supplement medium use . The use FCS however several drawback potential problem . We therefore establish MSC culture protocol animal serum free condition use human platelet lysate human plasma instead . The present phase I/II study design gather insight clinical benefit 50 patient ( adults child ) GvHD exert MSC expand human platelet lysate plasma</detailed_description>
