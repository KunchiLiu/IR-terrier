	<brief_title>Swallowing Disorders Geriatrics Studied With Respiratory Plethysmography Inductance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interest : swallow disorder exist age . More common among elderly , prevalence estimate 15 50 % 60 year . Recognized today health problem particular concern within population , pathological consequence multiple severe : inhalation pneumonia , often complication `` wrong track '' , recognize USA 1989 , 5th cause death among patient age 65 , 3rd lead cause death patient 85 year . Malnutrition facilitate infection depression immune system promote development bedsore . The swallow disorder result increase prevalence dehydration , social isolation , also increase mortality . Faced consequence , therefore necessary reliable , non-invasive approach adapt fragility elderly detect disorder order promote preventive strategy / curative justified . Originality : This work , part clinical approach use new method swallowing study , describe A. Moreau-Gaudry 's Medicine thesis : `` Assets respiratory inductance plethysmography study swallow geriatrics . '' The originality lie combination Respiratory Plethysmography inductance ( RPI ) informatic tool . The PRI allow continuous recording , thanks vest connect laptop , patient 's breathing rate . Readily available patient 's bedside , non-invasive perfectly suit fragility study population . The tool , automatic guarantee objectivity reproducibility analysis deglutition respiratory signal provide RPI .</detailed_description>
