	<detailed_description>Preoperative oral carbohydrate load issue investigate extensively term fundamental biochemically apparent effect potential benefit . Most commonly , proponent application advocate may beneficial improve patient outcome decrease complication rate attenuate postoperative insulin resistance . To date , however , study sufficient sample size able demonstrate mark value clinical practice . Almost clinical benefit ascribe application base subjective well-being , also provide non specific simple beverage . A study conduct show whether application direct influence patient outcome , therefore , could significantly contribute insight topic . The present study plan consist three study arm , namely : 1.Study group , give high-carbohydrate beverage ( Nutricia preOpÂ® , Numico , Zoetermeer , The Netherlands ) 2 . Placebo group , give flavored water , 3 . Control group ( surgery overnight fast ) . The revised power analysis show accrual 74 patient group would allow detect 15 % difference rate complication 80 % power 5 % level significance ( two tail ) . We hope recruit least 220 subject end two-year course . Once data record complete , study large one ever conduct investigate topic .</detailed_description>
