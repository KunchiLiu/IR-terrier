	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Comparing Volar , Dorsal , Custom Thermoplastic Splinting Treatment Acute Mallet Finger</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In case acute mallet finger , avulsion extensor digitorum communis terminal tendon distal phalanx , splint treatment strategy employ . These consider Doyle I injuries- closed injury without small ( &lt; 20 % ) avulsion fragment . Absolute relative indication surgical intervention include open injury , bony mallet involve great 20 % articular surface distal phalanx volar subluxation distal phalanx relative proximal phalanx . The type splint use treat Doyle I mallet injury continue controversial . Custom splint recently advocate though strong comparative evidence available . Objectives . The primary objective investigation show superiority custom thermoplastic splint dorsal volar non-custom splint . The null hypothesis radiographic lag difference great 5 degree would observe group . The primary outcome measure residual extensor lag difference ( compare contralateral equivalent digit ) 12 week post-splinting . Week-12 chosen compromise minimize drop-out distant timepoint reasonably obtainable . A novel outcome lag measurement develop study , use contralateral normal digit internal control establish residual extensor lag . The residual extensor lag difference calculate single radiograph obtain beam direct laterally affected digit contralateral equivalent digit ( Figure 2 ) . For example , injured mallet finger right index finger , single lateral radiograph right leave index finger film obtain . The patient instruct maximally extend digit . This allowed accurate determination extensor lag comparison unaffected side . Adequacy lateral view assess consider superimposition phalangeal condyle affect digit . If superimpose , radiograph repeat . A pilot study perform establish reliable technique measure residual lag radiographically . Three measurement technique trialled individual three level train : resident , fellow , consultant staff . A clearly define technique employ use digital image ( Inteleviewer , Intelerad , Montreal , Canada ) . The radiograph enlarge view monitor middle distal phalanx maximally fill screen . The technique use bisect line middle distal phalanx reference either volar cortex , dorsal cortex , longitudinal axis phalanx ( Figure 3 ) . Twenty-six lateral finger radiograph blind assess , repeat measurement obtain three week later . Inter-item correlation matrix intraobserver Pearson 's correlation show extremely high correlation value range 0.993 0.999 longitudinal axis technique . This pilot study establish longitudinal axis technique reliable measure residual radiographic lag . Several secondary objective investigate . These include correlation residual lag factor , include patient age , Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire score ( MHQ ) development complication ; incidence complication splint group ; compare radiographic clinical extensor lag difference ; evaluate course residual lag splint discontinue . Exploratory analysis perform hypothesis generator , include sub-group analysis .</detailed_description>
