	<brief_title>The Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Milatuzumab Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study determine whether anti-CD74 monoclonal antibody Milatuzumab provide benefit subject CLL advance stage progressive disease . The primary objective study assess response rate agent , well safety CLL , use different dos : Overall response ( OR ) , complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) determinate accord NCI criterion . The secondary objective determine : duration response , time progression , overall survival , range dos efficacy see MTD reach . This study do parallel phase I-II study conduct Immunomedics . The study design take account high level circulate CD74expressing cell CLL may affect acute ( although probably long term ) toxicity efficacy study medication . This could translate different MTD different cumulative dose Milatuzumab , need achieve response . ( either high dose longer treatment period. ) . The study divide two treatment phase . In first phase aim address whether dose 120 mg/m2 effective CLL , also safe . In second phase ass safety possible efficacy high dos , patient achieve significant response first phase . This do gradual dose escalation , exceed 600 mg , MTD reach study . In addition , study aim gain understanding effect Milatuzumab biological in-vitro function CLL cell .</detailed_description>
