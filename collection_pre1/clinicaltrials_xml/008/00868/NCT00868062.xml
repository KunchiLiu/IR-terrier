	<brief_summary>In situation dehydration , illness surgery , fluid 'drips ' give patient keep hydrate . Different fluid stay circulation different lengths time . For example , type fluid remain circulation short time mean patient would need give fluid achieve desire effect . Giving lot fluid sick patient cause problem , example , affect way bowel work delay patient 's recovery illness . In situation investigator use specialized fluid call colloid , design stay circulation longer . This mean small amount fluid need use less problem likely occur . There two different type colloid commonly use , investigator know well . The purpose study investigate two different colloid ( one call Gelofusin call Voluven ) work well patient undergo surgery . Knowing two fluid work best patient help u improve care surgical patient . The investigator hypothesis fluid large size molecule part solution work well surgery .</brief_summary>
