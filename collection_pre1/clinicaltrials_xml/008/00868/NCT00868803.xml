	<detailed_description>The goal study identify novel genetic element aberantly express throughout prostatic neoplastic progression . The approach propose exploit know familial arm prostatic cancer , use establish molecular genetic approach , extend study sporadic prostatic cancer use novel technique differential display . Application latter technique colon cancer American population establishes tumor type high priority scientific investigation study part initiative address problem . Presently study field prostate under-represented . The collection tissue sample patient diagnosed prostate cancer . Patients also provide blood sample time surgery potentially post-op 6 mos 5 year . Samples also obtain patient 's biopsy turn non-prostate cancer . These sample obtain shortly follow biopsy 6 month biopsy .</detailed_description>
