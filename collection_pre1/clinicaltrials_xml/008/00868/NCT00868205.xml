	<brief_summary>Food beverage intake lead decrease level vivo marker oxidative stress indicate food beverage act antioxidant ( AOX ) human . Coffee drink high level ( &gt; 900 ml/day ) short period time ( 1 week ) show reduce DNA oxidative damage—as indicate decrease level percent tail DNA ( % T ) — study population comprise mainly young adult age &lt; 30 year . It clear whether finding remain present long period time , extend finding across population representative European adult consume common daily intake coffee , low-to-moderate daily intake level ( &lt; 750 ml/day ) . As , investigator propose determine effect drink 3 5 cup coffee per day ( equivalent 450 750 ml per day , respectively ) 8-weeks marker vivo oxidative stress relative control population healthy adult free chronic disease age 35 65 year . To ensure overall health consider , investigator also evaluate effect marker cardiovascular health , inflammation , glycemic control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The main objective present study determine short- mid-term effect coffee , oxidative stress parameter human . Study design : randomize , placebo-controlled , investigator-blinded , 3-arm parallel Study population : 168 apparently healthy volunteer : male female age &gt; =35 &lt; = 65 year . Intervention : The treatment consist daily consumption either : Treatment 1 : 0.45 L coffee ( 3 cup ) 0.30 L bottle water daily ; Treatment 2 : 0.75 L coffee ( 5 cup ) daily ; Treatment 3 : 0.75 L water daily Duration treatment intervention 8 week . Before intervention period start , run-in period five week subject maintain low antioxidant diet ( Dutch average ) conduct subject order standardize antioxidant intake subject . Main study parameters/endpoints : Mean level % T measure DNA oxidative damage week 8 . Secondary outcome mean level 8-isoprostane 24 hr urine .</detailed_description>
