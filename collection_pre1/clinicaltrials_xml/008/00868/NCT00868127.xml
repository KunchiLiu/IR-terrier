	<brief_title>Safety Lapaquistat Acetate Subjects With Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated plasma cholesterol ( hypercholesterolemia ) various plasma lipid imbalance ( dyslipidemias ) major risk factor coronary heart disease . Normally , balance among cholesterol synthesis , dietary intake , degradation adequate maintain healthy cholesterol plasma level . However , patient hypercholesterolemia , elevation low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lead atherosclerotic deposition cholesterol arterial wall . Consequently , establish lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentration effectively reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality . As result finding , National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III identifies control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol essential prevention management coronary heart disease . Additional lipid risk factor designate Adult Treatment Panel III include elevate triglyceride , elevate non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol , low level high-density lipoprotein cholesterol . Lipoproteins rich triglyceride , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , appear contribute atherosclerosis , whereas apparent protective effect high-density lipoprotein cholesterol may limit low density lipoprotein concentration . Lapaquistat acetate squalene synthase inhibitor currently development Takeda treatment dyslipidemia . Participants study primary hypercholesterolemia complete either 12-week monotherapy protocol 01-04-TL-475-008 ( NCT00143663 ) 24-week atorvastatin add-on study 01-04-TL-475-009 ( NCT00143676 ) .</detailed_description>
