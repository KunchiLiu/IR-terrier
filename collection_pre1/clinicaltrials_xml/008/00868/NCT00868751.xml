	<brief_title>Single Patient Use Tocilizumab Systemic Onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ( soJIA ) type arthritis ( inflammation joint ) occur symptom include fever , swollen lymph node ( gland ) , rash , body ache . Because soJIA difficult treat , child soJIA severe problem long-term use steroid ( prednisone ) . These problem include low bone density ( weak bone ) , fracture , failure grow properly , large weight gain . The arthritis occur soJIA often cause damage many joint . This make hard move around basic task like dress . Also , life-threatening illness call Macrophage Activation Syndrome ( MAS ) occur start , stop , change drug use treat soJIA . SoJIA hard treat many child soJIA respond drug work kind arthritis . Research doctor study chemical signal call IL-6 body use manage inflammation . This signal find high patient active soJIA . A drug call tocilizumab ( TCZ ) design block IL-6 . For 6 year , TCZ test Japan treat soJIA . It test study United States . These study strict rule enrol patient . This trial single-patient research study subject otherwise meet rule enrollment ongoing trial .</detailed_description>
