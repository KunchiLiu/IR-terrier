	<brief_summary>The goal research provide data enhance development nutritional guideline , especially related mineral nutrition , child . Using human experimentation , study method deliver key mineral calcium , zinc iron diet optimize health outcome . We conduct control trial vitamin D supplementation ass effect vitamin D status calcium absorption small child . We evaluate effect differ intake zinc zinc copper absorption . These study utilize stable isotope technique provide accurate , practically applicable information may obtain study population safe manner . These data global application provide strong basis evidence-based nutritional recommendation develop . Objective # 1 : To evaluate effect supplemental vitamin D enhance calcium absorption healthy child 4 8 yrs age . Objective # 2 : Assess absorption magnesium zinc healthy child 4 8 yrs age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan stratify subject randomization either vitamin D supplement placebo serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 OHD ) three group : 0-20 ng/mL , 20-32 ng/mL , &gt; 32 ng/mL . There group assignment randomization magnesium zinc aspect study . SCREENING VISIT : At time enrollment , subject family ask come General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Texas Children 's Hospital screening visit . Prior visit , demographic parent/guardian record include child 's approximate height weight , study dietitian obtain two 24-hour dietary recall parent determine calcium intake enrollment . During screen visit , inform write consent obtain , medical history take , physical examination perform . The study dietitian instruct parent/guardian child use food scale weigh record dietary intake 3-day period ( ie , 3-day weigh diet record ) . The 3-day weighed diet record begin follow day . This method show provide best estimate dietary intake child ( Crawford PB et al , J Am Diet Assoc . 1994 ; 94:626-630 ; Fisher JO et al , Am J Clin Nutr . 2008 ; 88:407-415 ) . Upon analysis child 's intake , parent instruct maintain similar nutrient intake throughout study . Compliance monitor via 3-day weigh home diet record time study visit . If analysis show child 's intake significantly change ( Â± 20 % nutrient ) , parent counsel study dietitian readjust child 's intake back usual level determine baseline . In addition , study dietitian prepare sample menu base child 's food preference dietary intake level provide parent . Parents use sample menu assist maintain child 's usual mineral intake . STUDY VISIT 1 : Subjects parent/guardian return GCRC 24-hour overnight stay , arrive morning baseline stable isotope study . We utilize dual-tracer stable isotope technique previous study . At visit subject receive intravenous isotope dose 1 mg 42Ca , 6 mg 25Mg , 0.4 mg 70Zn . At time IV isotope , collect blood sample ( 10mL serum calcium , phosphorus , alkaline phosphatase , magnesium , 25OHD , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , hepcidin , ferritin , TIBC , transferrin saturation , hemoglobin , hematocrit , RBC index ) . Topical numb cream spray minimize pain injection site offer subject . A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) measurement total body bone mineral content/density body fat make . This do use covariate evaluate vitamin D level calcium absorption . A 24-hr urine collection stay inpatient begin time first isotope . After discharge , subject instruct collect another 48-hr urine collection ( 72-hr total ) home well final spot urine 96 hour first isotope . Subjects receive oral isotope ( 20 mcg 46Ca , 12 mg 26Mg , 2 mg 67Zn ) mix 120 mL calcium vitamin D-fortified orange juice milk . The breakfast fixed meal provide total ~300 mg calcium . Lunch provide ~300mg calcium ; dinner provide ~300mg calcium ( total ~900mg calcium ) . All meal GCRC pre- post-weighed determine actual intake . After discharge , subject record dietary intake use another 3-day weighed diet record . Approximately one week Study Visit 1 , result serum 25OHD test back stratify subject accordingly three group : 0-20 ng/mL , 20-32 ng/mL , &gt; 32 ng/mL . Subjects return CNRC provide supplemental vitamin D3 ( 1000 IU ) placebo , give daily ( base stratification note ) . Vitamin D/placebo provide use softgel liquid . Subjects instruct take supplement daily 8 week . They provide study calendar mark daily remember take supplement . Calendars remain supplement return study center count determine compliance . Subjects return urine sample , food scale , diet record study personnel CNRC . The CNRC driver may also utilize purpose pick sample deliver supplement . Periodic phone call make home subject monitor compliance take supplement . STUDY VISIT 2 : Eight ( 8 ) week subject begin take supplement , subject return GCRC repeat study absorption . Prior visit , subject receive food scale perform another 3-day weighed diet record demonstrate consistency diet throughout study period . Subjects arrive morning GCRC 24-hr inpatient study visit . They bring study calendar remain supplement compliance monitoring . Study Visit 2 similar aspect Study Visit 1 regard calcium vitamin D portion study . Magnesium zinc measurement repeat Study Visit 2 . At visit subject receive intravenous isotope dose 1 mg 42Ca . At time IV isotope , collect blood sample ( labs Study Visit 1 ) . Topical numb cream spray minimize pain injection site offer subject . A 24-hr urine collection stay inpatient begin time first isotope . After discharge , subject require continue additional urine collection . Subjects receive 20 mcg 46Ca stable isotope mix 120 mL calcium vitamin D-fortified orange juice milk . The breakfast fixed meal provide total ~300 mg calcium . Lunch provide ~300mg calcium ; dinner provide ~300mg calcium ( total ~900mg calcium ) . All meal GCRC pre- post-weighed determine actual intake . Upon discharge , subject discontinue supplementation study complete . In interpret result , note ethnicity , season measurement qualitative description sun exposure consider amount time spend outside . However , specifically assess sun exposure practical small child . In general , would expect large change Houston 8 week study , ensure two study cross period major change first study do summer camp second right afterwards . Urine serum sample prepare mass spectrometric analysis use oxalate precipitation technique . Samples analyze isotopic enrichment use magnetic sector ICP-MS . This high-speed instrument capable analysis desire ratio precision accuracy 0.3-0.5 % . Contingencies : We anticipate problem study would require change alter protocol . Our sample size allow u evaluate gender ethnicity separately determine difference effect among . There reason expect difference vitamin D effect calcium absorption base ( Weaver , personal communication ) . Additionally , dietary recommendation reflect diversity population identify trend towards specific ethnic gender effect study future population study . This study look absorption endpoint . If benefit find , develop long-term trial evaluate bone mineral outcome . However , would require large group full year study beyond scope initial study . If difference calcium absorption show 1000 IU/d vitamin D , extremely unlikely effect bone mineral would find justify long-term study . Magnesium absorption study require full 72-hour urine collection accuracy . It practical keep child age in-patient time 24 hour , collection do home . We extensive experience assist family home urine collection . There possibility loss urine 72-hour collection . However , case would continue collection method 's accuracy highly sensitive loss single small number urine specimens small child . Magnesium balance regulate endogenous excretion ( similar calcium ) thus absorption study provide adequate information estimate net balance . Subjects may tell weight height measurement visit GCRC . All study relate information hold end study .</detailed_description>
