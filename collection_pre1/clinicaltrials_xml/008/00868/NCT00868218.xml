	<brief_summary>The safety tolerability pandemic A/H5N1 virosomal vaccine formulate without 3rd generation ISCOM™ adjuvant parenteral administration investigate locally systemically use haematological , biochemical immunological screening test . The immunogenicity H5N1 vaccine assess induction local systemic antibody cellular immune response . In pandemic situation , important aspect rapidity immune response H5N1 vaccine detail kinetics immune response investigate . The capacity vaccine elicit long lasting immunity cross reactive immunity H5 viruses also evaluate . Furthermore , quality immune response induce vaccine study . The vaccine administer twice normal human dose ( 30μg HA ) without adjuvant , dose spar manor half ( 7.5μg HA ) one tenth ( 1.5μg HA ) normal human dose adjuvant . Sixty subject receive two dos virosomal H5N1 influenza vaccine ( separated 21 ± 4 day ) intramuscular injection deltoid muscle . Escalating dos separate period one week . Four group contain 15 subject receive two dos pandemic virosomal A/H5N1 influenza vaccine containing : Group 1 30µg HA IM , Group 2 1.5µg HA adjuvanted 50µg 3rd generation ISCOM™ IM , Group 3 7.5µg HA adjuvanted 50µg 3rd generation ISCOM™ IM , Group 4 30µg HA adjuvanted 50µg 3rd generation ISCOM™ IM .</brief_summary>
