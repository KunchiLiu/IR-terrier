	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) widespread condition characterize urgency , urge incontinence , nocturia excessive urinary frequency , affect million people worldwide . ( 1 ) In two epidemiological study , OAB find 17 % American European populations. ( 2 ) ( 3 ) . This account estimate 33 million patient suffer OAB USA . The disorder constitute psychological stress impact patient 's social life . The luminal surface bladder cover urothelium , function highly efficient barrier movement water ionize substance across bladder wall . ( 4 ) Urothelial cell also specialize sensory signal property allow respond chemical physical environment , engage reciprocal chemical communication neighbor nerve bladder wall . These property 1 ) nicotinic , muscarinic , tachykinin , adrenergic capsaicin ( TRPV1 ) receptor expression , 2 ) sensitivity transmitter release afferent efferent nerve , 3 ) mechanosensitivity , 4 ) close physical association afferent nerve 5 ) ability release chemical mediator ATP NO , regulate activity adjacent nerve , thereby , trigger local vascular change and/or reflex bladder contraction . ( 5 ) Transmitter release urothelial cell appear mediated calcium dependent exocytotic mechanism similar mechanism involve transmitter release nerve terminal . Transmitters release urothelial cell act autocrine/paracrine manner urothelium , subepithelial myofibroblasts , nerve blood vessel influence various function , include urothelial barrier , local blood flow sensory mechanism . ( 6 ) Urine cytokine assay study various bladder kidney disorder hope understand pathophysiology develop noninvasive , reliable predictor disease progression evaluate response treatment . Interstitial cystitis ( IC ) severely debilitate syndrome unknown etiology affect urinary bladder mainly associate urgency , frequency pain . Pro-inflammatory molecule neuroinflammation suggest patho-mechanism IC . Abdel Mageed Ghoniem find activation nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-k B ) bladder biopsy IC patient . NF-k B transcription factor find inflammatory disease like rheumatoid arthritis , bronchial asthma , inflammatory bowel disease . NF-k B role induction pro inflammatory cytokine IL-6 , IL-2 , IL-1β TNF-α . Activation NF-k B associate 27 , 8 , 10 7 fold increase TNF-α , IL-10 , IL-6 IL-8 transcript respectively . ( 7,8 ) Keay et al determine urine IC patient specifically contain factor inhibit primary bladder epithelial proliferation , anti proliferative factor ( APF ) significantly decrease heparin bind epidermal growth factor like factor ( HBEGF ) increase epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) level compare urine normal subject . ( 9 ) Chai et al compare urine level APF HB-EGF bladder distention neurostimulation . ( 10,11 ) Both urine marker change toward normal level hydrodistention neuromodulation treatment IC . Urinary cytokine also study patient undergo intravesical bacillus Calmette Guerin ( BCG ) therapy superficial bladder cancer . ( 12 ) BCG think cause local immunostimulation , result infiltration T-lymphocytes bladder wall . After treatment , IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-6 , TNF significantly elevate urine . It think BCG induce cytokine may generate bladder tumor kill cell , elevation urine cytokine may correlate clinical response BCG therapy . Recently , study attempt identify specific measurable urinary factor lead progression chronic renal disease . Cytokines involve recruitment inflammatory cell , lead infiltration diseased kidney , ultimately result renal scarring . Elevated level urinary IL-6 TNF receptor-1 identify child vesicoureteral reflux associate reflux nephropathy renal scarring . ( 13 ) Acute renal allograft rejection result recipient 's immune response donor kidney , 35 % patient experience episode acute rejection first year surgery . Elevated urinary cytokine measure patient biopsy proven renal allograft acute rejection . ( 14 ) Urinary cytokine marker identify different urological disorder . They use understand pathophysiology , diagnosis evaluation treatment disorder . We hypothesize urothelial abnormality case overactive bladder lead elaboration certain kind urinary cytokine . To knowledge , study publish evaluate urinary marker patient OAB .</detailed_description>
