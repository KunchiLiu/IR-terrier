	<brief_summary>This study patient advance cancer biliary tree , cholangiocarcinoma . They treat chemotherapy regimen consist Gemcitabine , Taxotere , Xeloda every 21 day least 9 week . Treatment continue cancer progress . This chemotherapy regimen use pancreatic cancer reason believe effective cancer biliary tree well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After initial presentation data concern regimen ( pancreatic cancer ) 2003 2004 ASCO meeting , number practitioner begin use regimen pancreatic cancer patient . More importantly , several investigator begin use regimen patient unresectable metastatic biliary tree cancer , cholangiocarcinoma . In personal communication u , cite absence reasonable alternative primary reason experiment novel regimen . They describe u case report , whereby patient cholangiocarcinoma objective response regimen . Personally , group , pilot study , treat 5 patient GTX regimen , document 3 partial response 1 stable disease 3 patient afflict cholangiocarcinoma 2 gall bladder cancer . In prospective study ( date 08/09 ) , three patient enrol two achieve partial response , RECIST parameter , &gt; 30 % reduction tumor size cycle 3 ( first evaluation point ) . Therefore , believe GTX show efficacy treat disease . Indeed , clinical evidence efficacy drug cholangiocarcinomas . In phase II trial , single agent gemcitabine produce 30 % partial response rate 30 % stable disease rate chemotherapy-naïve , cholangiocarcinoma patient . ( 8 ) A retrospective review patient treated combination fluorouracil ( continuous infusion ) gemcitabine ( 30 minute infusion ) demonstrate 33 % response rate 30 % stable disease rate , median survival 5.3 month . The low , observed rate grade 3-4 myelosuppression ( 11 % ) suggest well tolerate regimen . ( 9 ) Likewise , gemcitabine docetaxel combine treatment cancer , result 33 % response rate 36 % stable disease rate ( 3 ) . We hope improve upon study substitute sixty minute infusion rate gemcitabine instead traditional thirty minute infusion , substitute capecitabine infuse fluorouracil . In addition , test GTX regimen 2 cell line lab : one cholangiocarcinoma one gall bladder human line . We find GTX give cell , increased cytotoxicity , give amount dose sequence mimic GTX regimen protocol , significant synergistic cytotoxicity . This synergism produce approximately 3-fold increase cell kill compare combination drug single drug GTX regimen . Given laboratory data cholangiocarcinoma cell line demonstrate synergy drug , optimistic produce superior result le toxicity .</detailed_description>

Clinical Parameters Life expectancy &gt; 3 month Age ≥ 18 y.o Performance status 02 ( ECOG ) ( See Appendix IV ) Peripheral Neuropathy must ≤ grade 1 Able tolerate oral chemotherapeutic medication Required initial laboratory data CBC Differential Basic Metabolic Panel ( BMP ) Liver Function Tests ( LFTs ) Serum βHCG ( nonmenopausal female ) Tumor Specific Tests Hepatitis B C Tests Pulse Oximetry Room Air &gt; 90 % Informed Consent : Each patient must completely aware nature his/her disease process must willingly give consent inform experimental nature therapy , alternative , potential benefit , sideeffects , risk , discomfort . Hypersensitivity : Patients history severe hypersensitivity reaction docetaxel drug formulate polysorbate 80 must exclude . Prior malignancy last 5 year : curatively treat carcinoma insitu cervix , nonmelanoma skin cancer , DCIS ( ductal carcinoma situ ) early stage ( I II ) prostate cancer previously treat curative intent radiation and/or surgery cancer free . Known serious medical psychiatric illness prevent informed consent intensive treatment ( e.g. , serious infection ) . Patients CNS metastasis shall exclude . Patients compromise immune system increase risk toxicity lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , HIVpositive patient exclude study . Patients currently active inflammatory bowel disease ( ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's ) sclerosing cholangitis exclude . A history IBD 's sclerosing cholangitis acceptable disease remission quiescent . Active infection nonA hepatitis virus ( Hepatitis B C ) exclude</criteria>
