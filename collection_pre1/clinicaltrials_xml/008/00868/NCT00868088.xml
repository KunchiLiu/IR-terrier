	<brief_summary>Our study design evaluate efficacy photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) treatment actinic cheilitis ( AC ) adjunct Mohs surgery squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) lips . This study utilize FDA approve PDT modality ( DUSA , Inc. , Wilmington , MA 01887 ) use topical 5-amino-levulinic acid ( ALA ) photosensitization follow exposure Blu-U light source emit 405-420nm wavelength light .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : SCC lip commonly surround extensive AC , may affect part lip vermillion . While Mohs surgical technique complete margin control preferred treatment SCC critical location lip , technique complicate surround AC . AC SCC situ tumor edge make difficult achieve margin clear dysplasia result extra tissue beyond invasive SCC often need excised ensure entire tumor remove . Non-surgical treatment use alone treat SCC give low cure rate surgical removal , thus recommended place subject risk recurrence metastatic disease . Although one study report high SCC clearance rate PDT alone ( 24/25 SCCs histologically clear ) , recurrence 2 SCCs occur metastasis LN see one patient . ( Kubler et al . ) Given PDT show significant efficacy actinic keratoses actinic cheilitis inadequate primary treatment lip SCC , propose PDT may useful adjunct surgical resection , allow less extensive surgery dysplasia address PDT potentially low recurrence rate . Although imiquimod 5-FU also use treat cutaneous dysplasia , many favor PDT treatment due great tolerability , short healing time , predictable host response . There significant data efficacy PDT treatment actinic keratoses ( AKs ) PDT FDA approve treatment AKs . ( Piacquadio et al ) . Data PDT treatment AC much limit , small study case report indicate successful treatment AC regimens utilize either topical 5-aminolevulinic acid ( 5-ALA ) , similar compound , methylaminopentanoate ( MAL ) . The large study 5-ALA report complete clinical clearance 13/19 patient treat 1 3 treatment ALA plus Pulsed-dye laser ( Alexiades ) . Sotiriou et al report two PDT treatment 8/10 patient complete clinical histologic clearance ( Sotiriou ) . Case report indicate similar success ( Kodama ; Stender ) . Efficacy also show MAL PDT . One study find two session MAL + red light PDT complete histologic/ clinical clearance see 7/15 case AC partial clearance see additional 7/15 ( Berking et al ) . Smaller study case report show even high response rate without clinical recurrence short-term follow-up ( Rossi et al ; Hauschild et al ) . We choose 5-ALA plus blue light PDT treatment study FDA approve treatment AKs ALA available United States . Specific Aims : 1 . To determine whether pre-operative treatment lip ALA PDT reduce size post-surgical defect ( scar ) subject AC lip SCC 2 . To determine whether ALA PDT apply lip effectively clear actinic cheilitis ( AC ) SCC in-situ ( SCC-is ) lip . 3 . To assess tolerability ALA PDT treatment AC SCC-is lip</detailed_description>

Patients simultaneously participate another research study management SCC actinic cheilitis Subjects plan use form AC treatment prior Mohs . Subjects SCC require urgent ( sooner ) Mohs surgery , include tumor large ( &gt; 2cm discretion Principle Investigator ) subject pregnant palpable lymph node .</criteria>
