	<detailed_description>2.1 MALARIA AND ITS TRANSMISSION TO MOSQUITOES Malaria important parasitic disease world . Approximately one fourth world population risk contract disease , every year 2 million people , mainly young child sub-Sahara Africa , die malaria . Malaria cause single-cell ( protozoan ) parasites genus Plasmodium . Four specie cause human disease : P. falciparum , P. vivax , P. ovale P. malariae . The parasite transmit human bite infected female mosquito ( Anopheles ) . Inside human body , malaria parasite multiply rapidly liver cell . After approximately six day , parasite leave organ subsequently infect red blood cell ( erythrocyte ) . A next wave Plasmodium replication take place erythrocyte , red blood cell burst , follow infection new red blood cell parasites . Since part malaria life cycle involve asexual replication , parasites phase refer asexual parasite . A small fraction asexual parasite develop sexual stage parasite ( gametocyte ) . Asexual parasites responsible malaria morbidity mortality , gametocytes ensure transmission parasite human mosquito . Malaria transmission take place mature gametocyte ingest mosquito take blood meal . Once ingest , male female gametocyte merge form zygote develop though ookinete stage oocyst detect mosquito midgut within one week feeding . The oocyst burst sporozoite release migrate mosquito salivary gland . Once salivary gland infect sporozoite , mosquito capable infect new human being . 2.2 MALARIA TREATMENT WITH ARTEMISININ COMBINCATION THERAPY ( ACT ) Accurate diagnosis follow prompt efficacious treatment backbone malaria control programme . However , malaria treatment face huge challenge recent year . A number affordable antimalarial drug use cure malaria since 1940s : include chloroquine ( CQ ) , sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ; Fansidar® ) , mefloquine , amodiaquine ( AQ ) quinine . The emergence spread resistance commonly-used drug largely responsible worsen malaria situation observe past year . Across African continent , guideline recently change . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend falciparum malaria use combination therapy , preferably contain artemisinin derivative ( ACTs - artemisinin-based combination therapy ) . Artemisinin derivative , e.g . artesunate , artemether dihydroartemisinin , extremely potent antimalarial agent ideal partner combination antimalarial . ACTs three demonstrable advantage conventional therapy , ) efficacious treat malaria patient , ii ) substantially reduce post-treatment gametocyte carriaga iii ) `` protect '' partner drug select resistant parasite . In Tanzania , CQ SP lose clinical efficacy . CQ replace SP 2001 year 2006 , SP officially replace Artemether-Lumefantrine ( AL : Coartem® ) . The policy change artemisinin-based drug AL line WHO recommendations shift ACT first line antimalarial treatment . 2.3 RESISTANT PARASITES , MALARIA TRANSMISSION AND ACT Parasite resistance SP genetic background mutation parasite dihydrofolate reductase ( dhfr ) dihydropteroate synthetase ( dhps ) gene . Single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene associate clinical treatment failure . There also accumulate evidence mutant parasite strain also transmission advantage compare wildtype parasite . Gametocyte carriage high parasite mutation dhfr dhps gene , even parasites successfully clear due longer parasite clearance time . Importantly , mutant parasite also infectious mosquito . These worrying finding may explain rapid spread parasite resistance population . The finding also indicate gametocyte may use early warn system indicate development parasite resistance : parasite strain produce gametocyte likely reduce susceptibility drug . So far , ACT prove efficient tool reduce transmission malaria mosquito . Compared monotherapy SP , ACT reduce post-treatment gametocyte prevalence density . This translate reduction post-treatment malaria transmission . Compared monotherapy , few individual infectious mosquito ACT treatment average number infect mosquito oocyst burden mosquito reduce . Importantly , ACT completely prevent malaria transmission may counteract transmission mutant parasite strain . 2.4 ACT RESISTANCE There genuine fear resistance ACTs may develop . Although direct evidence full-blown clinical treatment failure artemisinin derivative , worry finding suggest reduced susceptibility parasite isolate ACTs . An increased resistance parasite isolate different artemisinin derivative observe vitro P. falciparum field isolate Cambodia , French Guiana , Senegal . This resistance associate SNPs codon S769N ATPase6 locus P. falciparum . In addition , lumefantrine component AL may exert selective pressure parasites mutation parasite multi-drug resistance 1 gene ( Pfmdr1 ) . In general , fear may selection artemisinin partner drug . Although ACTs clearly give hopeful result , yet evident combination drug provide best result , especially light possible artemisinin resistance18 . Recently , combination dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) find superior AL reduce risk recurrent parasitaemia post-treatment gametocytaemia . Based find SP resistant parasite strain exhibit high gametocyte production drug pressure , hypothesize gametocytaemia treatment use screen parasites likely reduce susceptibility ACT . 2 . JUSTIFICATION Studies development resistance ACT spread ACT resistant parasite strain population extremely relevant public health perspective . If resistance artemether-lumefantrine ACTs develop , alternative drug available first-line treatment . The identification predictive marker ACT resistance great value protection ACT . Studies malaria transmission ACT great importance identify mutation may eventually cause ACT resistance . The current study determines efficacy two different ACTs specific focus detect marker resistance reduce susceptibility parasites ACTs transmission potential mutant parasite .</detailed_description>
