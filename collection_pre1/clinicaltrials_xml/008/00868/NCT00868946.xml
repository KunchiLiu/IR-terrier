	<brief_summary>This treatment protocol use IND Ribavirin-there control group . Hemorrhagic Fever Renal Syndrome ( HFRS ) cause virus acquire contact chronically infected rodent host . HFRS present throughout Europe cause mainly Puumala Dobrava virus . Treatment consist mainly supportive care careful attention control blood pressure fluid balance and/or dialysis . Early initiation IND Intravenous Ribavirin show effective treatment HFRS may prevent need dialysis . It important initiate therapy base diagnosis consistent HFRS ( determination disease cause Puumala Dobrava virus helpful ) history make exposure likely . This study monitor clinical event occur HFRS well safety efficacy Ribavirin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , open label study safety IV Ribavirin treatment individual HFRS admit Landstuhl Regional Medical Center , Germany . The study also monitor morbidity mortality subject HFRS treat IV Ribavirin . The study population include subject probable suspected clinical diagnosis HFRS meet entry criterion 7 day course IV Ribavirin 28-60 day follow period first dose Ribavirin . In addition treatment Ribavirin , subject give standard supportive symptomatic care determine clinical judgment Principal Investigator , attend physician consultant manage subject 's care LRMC . Up 50 subject could potentially enrol five year time period expect accrual 0-5 subject per year . Specific inclusion/exclusion/relative exclusion criterion part protocol . Safety procedure require 7 day treatment include continuous cardiac monitoring , daily lab work , physical exam vital sign . Hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome ( HFRS ) cause virus genus Hantavirus family Bunyaviridae . There four known Hantaviruses cause HFRS : Hantaan , Seoul , Puumala , Dobrava viruses . Hantaan virus spherical , envelop virus designate prototype Hantavirus genus family Bunyaviridae ( Schmaljohn , 1983 ) . Serologic , morphologic , biochemical study establish virus relate Puumala virus , Seoul virus , Hantaviruses ( Schmaljohn , 1985 ) . HFRS acquire contact chronically infected rodent host , commonly inhalation infect rodent excreta ( urine , saliva , feces ) also report rodent bite . In Europe , HFRS cause mainly Puumala Dobrava virus , Puumala virus responsible case . Puumala virus , cause nephropathia epidemica ( NE ) Scandinavia ( also France , Germany , Belgium , Scotland , Italy ) , transmit Clethrionomys glareolus ( mole ) [ HFRS manual Niklasson ] . HFRS Puumala virus associate mortality rate &lt; 0.5 % . Oliguria report 40 % case , severe renal insufficiency generally observe 3 9 % case [ HFRS manual Lahdevirta ] . However , report HFRS due Puumala virus Germany associate severe renal disease necessitate dialysis 4/15 ( 26 % case ) [ Rasche et al , 2004 ) ] . Dobrava virus , cause severe form HFRS mainly Balkan Peninsula ( Hungary , Bulgaria , Albania , former Yugoslavia , Greece ) also Russia area west Ural Mountains , transmit rodent host Apodemus flavicollis ( yellow-necked field mouse ) , associate mortality rate 5 % -35 % { HFRS manual Tatjana ; HFRS manual Tkachenko ] . Less data available Dobrava virus , morbidity mortality expect similar HFRS cause Hantaan virus , perhaps severe . In one study HFRS Greece felt secondary Dobrava virus , 37 % case require dialysis 15 % case result death ( Antoniadis et al , 1989 ) . Disease Dobrava virus similar severity presentation disease Hantaan virus . However , HFRS Puumala low death rate dialysis rate risk IV Ribavirin treatment HFRS , particular , must measure benefit treatment . The decision start IND IV Ribavirin base whether HFRS likely Dobrava virus versus Puumala virus base epidemiological data past ongoing outbreak HFRS geographical area . Observation supportive care without use IND IV Ribavirin generally recommend medical management HFRS Puumala virus due low morbidity mortality associate HFRS Puumala virus . While case HFRS Europe Puumala Dobrava virus , experience IV ribavirin mainly HFRS cause Hantaan Seoul viruses Southeast Asia . All hantaviruses vitro sensitivity IV ribavirin . The data IV ribavirin HFRS cause hantaviruses Europe base experience HFRS Hantaan Seoul virus . Ribavirin license United States aerosol form treatment severe low respiratory tract infection child oral formulation combination recombinant interferon alpha treatment chronic hepatitis C infection . The intravenous formulation ribavirin license U.S. IV Ribavirin treatment HFRS use IND 16,666 .</detailed_description>
