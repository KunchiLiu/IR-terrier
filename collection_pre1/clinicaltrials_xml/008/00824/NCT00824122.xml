	<brief_summary>This study propose identify patient develop RMS vancomycin infusion , determine presence absence variant allele involve histamine biotransformation . The implication study important , identification variant alleles patient , may alter current standard care vancomycin infusion . The hypothesis study development red man syndrome ( RMS ) receipt intravenous vancomycin associate presence variant alleles gene involve histamine pathway . The primary outcome measure history RMS presence absence variant allele gene responsible histamine metabolism ( i.e . histamine n-methyltransferase diamine oxidase ) . As secondary endpoint , study also attempt determine incidence RMS pediatric patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vancomycin Associated Red Man Syndrome ( RMS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vancomycin utilized antimicrobial therapeutic agent serious gram positive infection half century.The pharmacokinetics vancomycin well study , general side effect medication . The common side effect occur receipt vancomycin red man syndrome ( RMS ) , also know red neck , red person syndrome.1 RMS encompass spectrum range mild reaction flushing , urticarial rash , pruritis , severe reaction include generalized erythema , intense pruritis , even hypotension . RMS estimate occur 5- 50 % hospitalized patient receive drug . RMS consider anaphylactoid type reaction due mast cell degranulation concomitant rise blood histamine level . The resultant symptomatology varies mild itch erythematous rash generalize reaction hypotension . This reaction show modified pre-treatment various type antihistamine include diphenhydramine cimetidine . There evidence suggest alter histamine metabolism contribute pathogenesis various disorder . Histamine almost exclusively metabolized enzyme histamine N-methyltranserase ( HNMT ) diamine oxidase ( DAO ) polymorphically express people vary frequencies.HNMT catalyzes N- methylation histamine . This predominant pathway histamine metabolism , account 50-80 % biotransformation . Diamine oxidase ( DAO ) likely contribute significant manner remain metabolism histamine 2-3 % autocoid excrete unchanged urine . It plausible allelic variant HNMT and/or DAO may contribute histmaminergic reaction give patient resultant propagation pharmacologic effect , polymorphically express enzyme primarily responsible terminate pharmacologic activity histamine ( via biotransformation ) may play crucial role determine disease phenotype disorder ( e.g. , RMS ) histamine key mediator . This prospective study conduct one year period time . Eligible patient identify search patient receive vancomycin therapy throughout study period . Chart review/patient interview perform identify patient develop symptomatology consistent RMS receive vancomycin infusion . For purpose study , red man syndrome ( RMS ) define : erythematous rash , flush face , neck , torso , itching , lower systolic diastolic blood pressure &gt; 10mm/hg . A subset patient remain asymptomatic throughout vancomycin therapy also evaluate control group .</detailed_description>
