	<brief_title>Behavior Exercise Versus Drug Treatment Men With Nocturia ( BEDTiMe )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nocturia , wake night sleep void , prevalent troublesome symptom . While low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) -- include poor urinary stream , urgency , frequency , strain void -- also common , nocturia one bothersome LUTS . Nocturia cause sleep disruption associate accidental fall high utilization sick day work . Conditions result low volume urinary void , high urine production night , and/or primary sleep disturbance cause nocturia . Overactive bladder ( OAB ) , benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , poorly control diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , peripheral edema , obstructive sleep apnea cause nocturia . Individual patient frequently multiple condition potentially relate nocturia , highlight need strategy broad-based intervention . Treatment alpha-adrenergic antagonist medication ( α-blockers ) standard therapy LUTS men , α-blockers offer limited reduction nocturia . While combination multiple drug could also employ successfully treat nocturia , non-drug treatment important option unwilling unable take additional medication . The BEDTiMe Nocturia Study ( Behavior Exercise Drug Trial Men Nocturia ) , two-site ( Atlanta Birmingham ) , randomize , clinical trial . The 200 male participant stratify degree nocturia urinary flow rate randomize three treatment arm : 1 ) α-blocker therapy alone ; versus 2 ) standardize , multicomponent behavioral exercise therapy ( M-BET ) , give placebo tablet ; versus 3 ) combination therapy ( M-BET α-blockers ) . The M-BET intervention include : training pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation , self monitor bladder diary , teach urge suppression skill inhibit detrusor contraction ; fluid management strategy ; sleep hygiene strategy ; non-pharmacological management low extremity edema . Interventions similar M-BET show reduction nocturia woman urge urinary incontinence ( UI ) exceed benefit anticholinergic drug therapy . The use intervention men build upon strong pilot data MINIM trial ( Multicomponent Interventions Nocturia Men ; VA GRECC Pilot , VA Medical Research Services ) ongoing study Behavioral Treatment For Overactive Bladder In Men ( VA RR &amp; D B02-2489R , Burgio , PI ) . The study design allow 3 main research question address : 1 ) Does M-BET reduce nocturia α-blockers ? ; 2 ) Does M-BET improve sleep α-blockers ? ; 3 ) Will combination therapy effective either treatment alone ? The main outcome nocturia reduction sleep improvement 12 week . Nocturia reduction assess participant complete bladder diary sleep improvement assess wrist-actigraph determined sleep efficiency , total sleep time , wake time sleep onset . This study yield important information relate alternative treatment nocturia male veteran , well novel information regard clinical importance nocturia reduction . Though many clinician employ single-agent α-blockers routinely treatment nocturia , utilize multicomponent behavioral intervention use behavioral therapy . Thus , study potential alter standard care .</detailed_description>
