	<brief_summary>Objective : To evaluate safety efficacy topical cyclosporine eye drop ( Restasis® ) treatment epiphora cause canalicular stenosis secondary Docetaxel ( Taxotere® ) treatment various cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Cyclosporine v . Placebo Epiphora Associated With Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Restasis® also know cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05 % ( cyclosporine eye drop ) . It design decrease eye inflammation . FML Forte® also know fluorometholone 0.25 % ophthalmic suspension ( fluorometholone eye drop ) . It design decrease eye inflammation . Fluorometholone eye drop commonly use help control epiphora . In study , additional type eye drop use comparison cyclosporine eye drop . This second type eye drop call Refresh Endura™ ( lubricant eye drop ) , design relieve dry eye . Unlike cyclosporine fluorometholone , active ingredient design treat epiphora . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 group . The way assign participant group mostly random , flip coin . However , epiphora score ( often dab tear , record diary ) also affect group assign . Group 1 receive cyclosporine eye drop fluorometholone eye drop . Group 2 receive lubricant eye drop fluorometholone eye drop . Neither study staff know whether receive cyclosporine eye drop lubricant eye drop . However , need safety , study staff able find one receiving . Study Drug Administration Your first dose study drug give clinic Day 1 . After , give rest dose home . The study staff teach use eye drop , give write instruction . Study data collect eye , apply drops eye . If wear contact lens , sure take contact lens use eye drop . Fifteen ( 15 ) minute dose eye drop , may put contact lenses back . If Group 1 , apply 1 drop cyclosporine eye drop eye , 2 time day , 84 day ( 12 week ) row . You wait 12 hour dos . If Group 2 , apply 1 drop lubricant eye drop eye , 2 time day , 84 day row . You wait 12 hour dos . All study participant must wait least 10 minute apply eye drop ( cyclosporine lubricant ) apply fluorometholone eye drop . All study participant receive fluorometholone eye drop . During Week 1 , apply 1 drop eye , 4 time day . During Week 2 , apply 1 drop eye , 3 time day . During Week 3 , apply 1 drop eye , 2 time day . During Week 4 , apply 1 drop eye , day . Study Visits : On Visit 1 ( Day -1 -2 ) , eye doctor and/or study staff ask sign write informed consent . Screening test do , include urine pregnancy test woman able become pregnant , eye exam , Best Corrected Visual Acuity , Biomicroscopy , Intraocular Pressure ( IOP ) , Epiphora Assessments , Schirmer 's Test , Probing Irrigation Test . Your eye doctor and/or assistant explain different eye exam , question may , day visit . You also ask different medication currently take . You give participant diary record keep track medication use many time dab tear . You give schedule next visit . On Visit 2 ( Day 0 baseline ) , study staff record well tolerate study drug side effect may occur dos . You also complete 2 questionnaire . The first questionnaire ask quality life second questionnaire ask problem vision may experience . In total , take 10-15 minute complete . You give additional patient diary . In first diary , record miss dos study drug . In second diary , record many time dab tear eye and/or face , start 24 hour clinic visit . You bring complete patient diary use container study drug every study visit . At Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , follow procedure perform : - You routine eye exam check status epiphora . The eye test perform screen . However , routine procedure call `` probe irrigation '' ( test tear duct , involve water ) may need repeat . The probe irrigation procedure perform epiphora seem gotten bad . In case , probe irrigation procedure help doctor decide whether recommend consider additional treatment . - You ask side effect may experience , drug treatment may receive , change current drug treatment . - You repeat quality-of-life questionnaire . You also complete second questionnaire overall eye comfort third questionnaire eye tear symptom . In total , questionnaire take 20 minute complete . Length Study Participation : You may stay study treatment 12 week . If intolerable side effect occur , epiphora get bad study doctor think consider surgery treat , take study treatment early . End-of-Study Visit : After last dose study drug ( Week 12 , early go study treatment early ) , return end-of-study visit . At visit , follow procedure perform : - You procedure perform Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 . - You complete quality-of-life questionnaire , questionnaire asks problem vision , questionnaire asks eye tear symptom improve gotten bad compare day start study . In total , questionnaire take 20 minute complete . - Women able child urine pregnancy test . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . Cyclosporine eye drop , fluorometholone eye drop , Refresh Endura™ lubricant eye drop commercially available eye condition . They FDA approve use treat epiphora . At time purpose , consider experimental . This include fluorometholone eye drop , commonly use treat epiphora FDA approve use . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
