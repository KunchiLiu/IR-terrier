	<brief_summary>This single arm phase II trial study efficacy safety Cdk inhibitor P276-00 treatment squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Patients recurrent metastatic disease unresectable incurable radiation enrol . Thirty eight evaluable patient need enrol study . All patient receive protocol treatment i.e . P276-00 intravenous infusion day 1 day 5 day 8 day 12 21 day cycle till progression disease unacceptable toxicity . Safety evaluation mean record vitals , physical examination lab investigation like hematology clinical chemistry undertaken regular interval cycle . Tumor measurement spiral CT scan undertaken baseline end every 2 cycle response evaluation RECIST criterion . All patient follow survival status till one year cycle 1 day 1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Clinical Trial Study Efficacy Safety New Drug P276-00 Treatment Recurrent and/or Locally Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>P276-00 administer dose 185mg/m2/day day 1 day 5 21 day cycle . The protocol amend July 2009 . As per amendment P276-00 administer dose 144 mg/m2/day day 1 day 5 day 8 day 12 21 day cycle till progression disease unacceptable toxicity.33 patient recruit version 1 protocol , 38 evaluable patient need recruit version 2 protocol . Allowing approximately 30 % drop-outs , estimate , enrol 38 evaluable subject study , approximately 54 subject would enrol . As study already enrol 33 subject , sample size study accommodate number subject ( 38 evaluable ) revise protocol estimate approximately 87 ( 33 + 54 ) subject . Hence total sample size ( account drop-outs ) 87 patient .</detailed_description>
