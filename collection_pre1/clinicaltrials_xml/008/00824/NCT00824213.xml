	<brief_title>Pilot Project : Fast Whole-body Spect Scanning Improve Detection Bone Metastases Patients With Diagnosed Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Bone scintigraphy ( e.g . `` bone scan '' ) Tc-99m diphosphonates one common image radioisotope procedure department nuclear medicine worldwide , several thousand perform every year busy nuclear medicine service . Despite give fast accurate skeletal survey condition range metastatic cancer , fracture , infection , technology see little change since early 1970 's . The Anger camera remain instrument choice take serial image patient 's skeleton , since late 1970 's SPECT ( Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ) - essentially `` nuclear CT image 3-D distribution radiotracer '' add improve contrast resolution lesion placement . Despite know great sensitivity SPECT compare planar bone nuclear medicine study , SPECT usually do limited patient due time constraint . This standard tomographic bone acquisition require 20 minute , therefore usually perform one body region abdomen chest . Skeletal PET scan F-18 Fluoride become popular since introduction multiple PET scanner image cancer F-18 FDG . It provide much high count rate traditional bone scan do Tc-99m phosphate , many author show sensitive imaging modality detect skeletal lesion . Indeed , several PET center propose replace standard Tc-99m bone scan F-18 PET scan . However short half-life F-18 make type study practical PET center within short distance cyclotron . Furthermore , PET scanner usually fully occupied type diagnostic oncology study , cost F-18 currently reimburse simple skeletal survey . Recently become feasible dramatically shorten time necessary acquisition nuclear medicine SPECT study . This occur introduction new image reconstruction software include resolution recovery correction ( call `` collimator de-blurring '' ) . Since approach result significant improvement image resolution , many center currently look feasibility use new technique reduce image time . For example , use investigate nuclear cardiac scan acquisition time shorten half . We propose investigate performance image reconstruction software resolution recovery correction bone SPECT study . We estimate 30 minute , use new technique collimator de-blurring , one could perform fully 3-dimensional SPECT whole-body bone study , essentially obviate necessity planar bone study . In scope propose project , group aim test hypothesis one perform Tc-99m whole-body SPECT study time regular routine planar bone study , great localization accuracy , great lesion detection . To establish `` gold standard '' necessary ass performance SPECT bone scan , compare number malignant lesion detect patient proven metastatic skeletal bone lesion PET F-18 whole-body scan , whole-body Tc-99m SPECT lesion . We also propose compare detection SPECT scan standard planar bone scan . This allow two major comparison ( ) accuracy SPECT bone study compare planar bone study , ( b ) accuracy SPECT bone scan compare F-18 PET study . Most prior study purport show superiority F-18 bone scan Tc-99 bone scan do either planar scan combination planar scan partial SPECT study spine . We anticipate F-18 bone scan , due high count statistic PET agent , show lesion SPECT , exact increase sensitivity never compare whole-body SPECT scan . Objectives 1 . Evaluate feasibility implement whole-body SPECT routine practice standard SPECT gamma camera 2 . Evaluate value whole-body SPECT compare whole-body planar study detection bone metastases 3 . Compare result state-of-the art whole-body SPECT skeleton survey state-of-the art whole-body Na18F PET whole-body bone survey . 4 . Obtain preliminary data respective accuracy planar bone scintigraphy , whole-body SPECT Na18F PET/CT plan future study cost-effectiveness method improve prostate cancer stag . Hypotheses 1 . A whole-body bone SPECT sensitive specific conventional planar bone scan detection bone metastases 2 . Whole-body bone SPECT less sensitive whole-body bone PET low sensitivity minimal impact overall detection bone metastases patient basis Overall study design This open phase II study design accumulate preliminary data relative diagnostic value planar bone scintigraphy , whole-body bone SPECT whole-body bone PET sodium 18F-Fluoride . We plan accrue total 25 subject suspect bone metastasis undergo planar bone scintigraphy , bone SPECT Na18F whole-body bone PET scan . Data analysis All patient study analyze 3 independent nuclear medicine reader , number lesion identify planar scan compare number lesion non-Astonish SPECT bone scan Astonish SPECT bone scan . Each study score noting : - number localization lesion detect - level certainty ( 1 = definitely malignant , 5= definitely benign ) - general visual quality image ( grade 1 = poor 5 = excellent ) The Na18F PET/CT bone study serve reference gold-standard study acquisition judge . Statistical consideration This pilot study provide preliminary data power calculation estimate study size need demonstrate statistically significant improvement whole-body SPECT compare planar scintigraphy . With 25 subject , 82 % chance demonstrate statistically significant 30 % difference accuracy planar scintigraphy whole-body SPECT compare reference standard ( PET/CT ) .</detailed_description>
