	<detailed_description>Study Imaging : As part routine care , ultrasound scan commonly use find cancerous area prostate prostate surgically remove . The ultrasound image black , white , gray , dark area may show prostate cancer . In study , standard ultrasound scan still do , researcher want test another form diagnostic imaging call tissue elastography . Tissue elastography use machine probe ultrasound . The probe gently push rectum prostate gland ( similar digital rectal exam ) . The ultrasound machine use special elastography software design scan prostate difference hard tissue . Prostate cancer tissue may harder surround tissue , image produce tissue elastography design show difference hardness tissue . Screening : Before join study , study staff review result recent prostate ultrasound biopsy . This `` screening '' procedure help doctor decide eligible take part study . Study Procedures : If find eligible take part study , tissue elastography image perform routine ultrasound prostate surgery . The probe , insert , gently press prostate time order perform tissue elastography . The routine ultrasound part procedure take 10 minute , elastography take 10-15 minute . Length Study Participation : Your active participation study tissue elastography imaging . The routine ultrasound main decision-making exam . However , tissue elastography imaging show something different possibly relate care , doctor inform . After prostate remove tissue result available , researcher compare tissue result tissue elastography image . You receive result tissue elastography imaging , image use research . This investigational study . The ultrasound machine probe use tissue elastography study FDA approve ultrasound scan . Performing tissue elastography prostate cancer detection investigational . At time purpose , tissue elastography perform research . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
