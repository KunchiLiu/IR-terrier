	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) common disorder lead heart failure . Not people CAD eligible today 's standard treatment . One new treatment approach use stem cells—specialized cell capable develop type cells—to stimulate growth new blood vessel heart . This study determine safety effectiveness withdraw stem cell someone 's bone marrow inject cell person 's heart way treat people CAD heart failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , disease blood vessel become clogged build-up plaque , lead cause heart failure , condition heart longer pump enough blood rest body . People heart failure cause CAD say ischemic cardiomyopathy . Normal treatment CAD involve coronary artery bypass grafting ( vein another part body graft around artery become block ) coronary angioplasty stent placement ( blocked artery open small tube place keep artery open ) . However , people ischemic cardiomyopathy , substantial scar tissue heart wall particular heart structure , may eligible treatment . An alternative treatment develop therapeutic angiogenesis , involve stimulate growth new blood vessel . Recent research show withdraw stem cell bone marrow implant cell heart tissue may effective way achieve therapeutic angiogenesis . This study determine safety effectiveness use stem cell stimulate new blood vessel growth hearts people ischemic cardiomyopathy . Participation study , include follow-up visit phone call , last 60 month . Participants first undergo 3 4 day screen procedure include physical examination , multiple lab test , battery test heart health . Next , participant randomize receive either active stem cell injection placebo injection . The injection related procedure perform hospital last approximately 72 hour . During time , participant group first undergo bone marrow aspiration procedure . Participants receive active stem cell also undergo NOGA electromechanical cardiac mapping , involve insert monitor device catheter heart . Injections stem cell make 15 damage site heart special catheter . Participants receive placebo injection receive 15 injection inactive , saline-based solution . After injection procedure , participant undergo two echocardiogram , electrocardiogram , blood test , overnight monitoring telemetry unit . After hospital stay , participant attend five study visit occur 1 week 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month injection procedure . At study visit , participant undergo electrocardiogram , lab test , review adverse health event . On last study visit , participant cardiac marker assess , wear 24-hour Holter monitor track heart activity . At last three visit , participant also complete quality life questionnaire . All participant receive four follow-up telephone call occur 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year injection procedure .</detailed_description>
