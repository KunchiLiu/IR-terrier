	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study see ibandronate help slow rate bone loss may occur patient receive bone marrow transplant blood cancer . This study plan address follow hypothesis : 1 . The addition Ibandronate initiate immediately transplantation prevent bone loss patient undergo allogenic bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) underlie hematologic malignancy hematologic disorder . 2 . BMT patient require prolonged steroid immunosuppressive treatment Graft versus Host Diseases ( GVHD ) high rate bone loss , prevent attenuated Ibandronate . Specific objectives test hypothesis : 1 . Primary Objective : 1 . To prospectively compare bone mineral density change lumbar spine , femoral neck total hip patient randomly assign ibandronate control group 12 month post bone marrow transplantation University Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center . 2 . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To measure compare accumulate level steroid use treatment control group . 2 . To collect compare level serum C-terminal telopeptide ( CTX ) treatment control group monitor bone turnover rate duration study . 3 . To conduct cost-effectiveness analysis participate patient outcomes bone mineral density ( measure data ) skeletal-related event ( model data ) . 4 . To record incidence bone fracture graft rate treatment control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Ibandronate design slow rate bone loss . Screening Process : Before receive study drug , study doctor check result various test recently perform part standard care bone marrow transplant . These test result help doctor decide eligible take part study . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study choose take part , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 study group . Group 1 ( `` treatment '' group ) receive ibandronate addition calcium vitamin D supplement . Group 2 receive calcium vitamin D supplement . The chance either group equal . Study Visits : For group , visit research team member hospital stay soon transplant ( Month Zero [ 0 ] ) , routine visit transplant doctor 's office Months 3 , 6 , 9 transplant . At study visit , ask feeling , well whether bone fracture ( breakage ) . At Months 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 transplant , blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn routine test transplant follow-up . As part blood draw , additional ½ tablespoon blood drawn study visit ( Months 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 ) . This blood test `` marker '' bone may help researcher predict may respond treatment . If `` treatment '' group , receive total 4 ibandronate infusion vein ( 15-30 second time ) . These study drug infusion take place hospital routine visit transplant doctor 's office 3-6 week transplant , Months 3 , 6 , 9 transplant . At Month 6 , study participant study-related ( non-routine ) bone density test ( x-ray ) perform check bone loss . If test result show lose abnormally large amount bone mineral , take study also advise treatment option . Vitamin Supplements : All study participant receive supply calcium vitamin D take home , general bone health . These supplement take mouth , twice day 12 month . If tolerate supplement provide research study , may take another brand calcium/Vitamin D buy over-the-counter . The dos take time ( twice daily ) 500 mg calcium 400 International Units ( IU ) Vitamin D. Cost Analysis : Researchers study also want look cost-effective different procedure treatment study . To , use information patient record , pharmacy record , information M. D. Anderson databases . You ask actively participate interview procedure study , aware research take place study . End-of-Study Visit : You visit research team member routine visit transplant doctor 's office Month 12 transplant . At visit , ask feel well whether bone fracture . Your doctor check x-ray , outside x-ray film available . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . As part blood draw , additional ½ tablespoon blood drawn test bone marker . You routine bone density test ( x-ray ) perform check bone loss . After test , participation study . This investigational study . Ibandronate commercially available FDA approve use prevention treatment bone loss woman menopause . However , use slow rate bone loss patient bone marrow transplant consider experimental . For purpose , M. D. Anderson Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) authorize use ibandronate research . The IRB committee make doctor , researcher , member community . The IRB responsible protect participant involve research study make sure research do safe ethical manner . Up 200 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age great equal 18 year . 2 . Patients diagnosis hematologic malignancy hematological disorder , immediately post allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . 3 . Female patient childbearing potential ( i.e . hysterectomy , loss menses 12 consecutive month ) , must willing use contraception . 4 . Negative pregnancy test premenopausal patient . 5 . Patients GVHD infection enter respond treatment become control . 6 . Dental consideration : patient negative dental screen jaw osteonecrosis 03 month prior transplant patient plan tooth extraction near future . 1 . Patients document relapsed malignancy recurrence original hematological disorder transplant , uncontrolled acute GVHD , uncontrolled infection . 2 . Patients hypocalcemia less 8.4 ( correct account albumin level ) . 3 . Patients hypercalcemia &gt; 12.2 , due cause related hematological malignancy hematological disorder ( i.e . hyperparathyroidism , multiple myeloma ) . 4 . Hypersensitivity Ibandronate bisphosphonates . 5 . Preexisting osteoporosis , define bone density Tscore 2.5 S.D . less . 6 . Renal insufficiency ( calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min ) . 7 . Patients already bisphosphonates ( past two year ) , calcitonin , anabolic steroid , daily oral fluoride supplement . 8 . Myeloma patient previously bisphosphonates past two year and/or active bone lesion . 9 . If correct calcium 10.3 iPTH elevate normal , patient exclude study . 10 . Patients 25hydroxyvitamin D concentration &lt; 20 ng/ml evidence osteomalacia ( low ionize calcium elevate intact PTH ) . 11 . Dental consideration : Patients recent tooth extraction sign incomplete heal significant infection exclude .</criteria>
