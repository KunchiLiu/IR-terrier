	<brief_title>Stimulant Drug Treatment Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( AD/HD ) , Inattentive Type</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Inattentive subtype ( IN ) Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder newly define DSM-IV ( 1994 ) . Recent epidemiological study suggest IN least common impair academically socially commonly recognize Combined type ( CB ) . However , little known etiology , course outcome , treatment IN type . Notably , although stimulant drug commonly use clinically treat disorder , systematic study efficacy IN subtype . Differences IN CB subtypes behavioral phenotype , well gender ratio , age onset , comorbidity suggest may critical difference neurobiology , may relevance response drug treatment . The lack data concern stimulant drug efficacy IN type thus constitute important issue perspective public health quality care . The propose research responsive current RFA study efficacy establish treatment ( stimulant ) new patient population ( IN subtype ) . A second specific aim test hypothesis , emerge review literature , divergence dose-response curve effect activity attention . We predict dose optimizes performance rating hyperactivity-impulsivity low optimizes performance rating academic function neuropsychological test . We similarly examine whether difference dose-response curve specific function extend difference subtypes optimal dose . The final aim current study compare IN CB subtypes respect select measure neurocognitive function placebo response drug treatment . We predict IN subtype perform poorly measure spatial orient stimulus encoding , whereas CB subtype show great deficit measure cognitive inhibitory control , type cognitive deficit respond drug treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inattentive Subtype : 1 . A diagnosis structure DISC interview conduct parent , ADHD , Predominantly Inattentive Type . 2 . Ratings parent teacher correspond total score 93rd percentile ( i.e . 1.5 SD mean ) scale `` DSMIV Inattention '' current Conners Parent ( Teacher ) Rating Scale Long Form . The item scale inattention symptom criterion DSMIV , informant ask rate severity 4point scale range severity 0 ( `` '' ) 3 ( `` much '' ) . A score 93th percentile indicate child 's score equal exceed 93 % child age ( within 2 year ) gender . ( ) Scores 1 SD ( 84th percentile ) mean DSMIVHyperactiveImpulsive scale Conners Parent Teacher Rating ScalesLong Form . Combined Subtype : 1 . A diagnosis ADHD , Combined type structure DISC interview parent . 2 . Ratings parent teacher correspond total score 93rd percentile ( i.e . 1.5 SD mean ) scale `` DSMIV attention '' current Conners Parent ( Teacher ) Rating Scales Long Form . 3 . Ratings parent teacher correspond total score 93rd percentile ( i.e . 1.5 SD mean ) scale `` DSMIV HyperactiveImpulsive '' symptom current Conners Parent ( Teacher ) Rating Scales Long Form . Both Groups : Inclusion Criterion : The child 's school must agree administer medication midday allow teacher complete requisite behavior rating . 1 . WISCIII fullscale IQ le 80 . 2 . Major acute chronic medical condition , include sensory loss , neurological disorder , medical condition would preclude use stimulant medication . 3 . Comorbidity : The study rationale inclusion/exclusion comorbid psychological/psychiatric condition follow : child study treatment contraindicate , treatment provide study require immediately , enter trial . Thus , example , comorbid depression anxiety disorder permit provided immediate treatment depressive anxiety disorder require . Tic disorder mild moderate severity , stable , would eligible inclusion , would constitute contraindication receive stimulant . However , child pronounce unstable tic would eligible trial . Children follow condition exclude study : psychosis , pervasive developmental disorder , bipolar disorder . Thus child permit study comorbid learn disability , oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder . The Wechsler Individual Achievement Tests administer order characterize sample respect presence comorbid learn disability . 4 . Concomitant medication : Systemically absorb medication exclusionary , nonsystemically absorbed medication generally permit . Children take experimental medication past month exclude . Any prior psychotropic medication must suitable washout period least 4 halflives assessment begin ( generally minimum 2 week ; 4 week fluoxetine ) . Children take methylphenidate time inquiry may withdraw medication treatment response less optimal reevaluation deem clinically necessary . Children take psychotropic medication may discontinue , provide prescribing physician agreement plan , provide clinical indication ( i.e. , either inadequate response , adverse effect problematic timeaction property ) .</criteria>
