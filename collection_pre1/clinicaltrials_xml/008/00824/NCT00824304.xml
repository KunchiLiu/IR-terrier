	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study : 1 . Compared child receive placebo , child receive iron zinc iron zinc combine perform well cognitive test well growth status age 8 10 year . 2 . Compared child receive iron zinc alone , child receive iron zinc combine perform differently cognitive test different growth status 8 age 8 10 year 3 . Compared child poor iron zinc status poorer growth status supplementation infancy , child well iron zinc status well growth status supplementation infancy perform well cognitive test well growth status age 8 10 year . 4 . Compared child low iron zinc status , poor growth status , low animal source intake age 8 10 year , child higher iron zinc status , good growth status , high animal source intake age 8 10 year perform well cognitive test well growth status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Effects Iron Zinc Supplementation During Infancy Cognitive Performance Growth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron zinc important micronutrient cognitive development growth child , particularly infancy brain development physical growth rapid . Iron zinc deficiency likely coexist young child poor develop country due high requirement micronutrient age , low consumption animal product ( rich source nutrient ) similar problem poor bioavailability plant food . One would expect iron zinc supplementation infancy would appropriate strategy promote long-term cognitive development school achievement , never evaluate . We many study effect micronutrient intervention infancy benefit intervention assess term outcomes infancy . What miss study micronutrient intervention critical phase infancy report effect measure school child beyond . Only begin understand full impact micronutrient intervention infancy human function . From 1998 1999 , randomize , placebo control trial iron zinc supplementation carry 609 4-6 month-old infant Khon Kaen province , Thailand . Infants randomize four group ( zinc , iron , iron zinc , placebo ) supplement receive 10 mg iron and/or 10 mg zinc daily 6 month . Improvements iron zinc status ponderal growth find ; measure cognitive development infancy include . We propose follow-up study child age 8 10 year . From February July 2006 , conduct pilot study able locate 584 96 % sample . The child school propose ass schooling , cognitive performance ( Wechsler test adapt Thailand ) language mathematical skill . In addition , data physical growth , biochemical status , dietary intake socioeconomic status collect . We expect knowledge study useful properly assess full benefit improve iron zinc status early childhood .</detailed_description>
