	<brief_summary>Tissue hypoxia accept trigger erythropoietin ( EPO ) production . However , healthy subject EPO concentration also increase oxygen breathing . The aim study confirm observation . Besides main function erythropoiesis , EPO also show tissue protective effect . The second goal study observe cardioprotective effect increase endogenous EPO , induce normobaric oxygen breathing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently , renal tissue hypoxia widely accept trigger erythropoietin ( EPO ) production . However , previous study healthy subject demonstrate sudden sustained decrease tissue oxygen level , aside absolute low level tissue oxygen tension , could also act trigger EPO production . To confirm observation clarify eventual role free oxygen radical antioxidant , hypobaric pure oxygen administer healthy subject . The major physiologic function EPO think induction erythropoiesis . However , grow body evidence indicate EPO tissue-protective effect prevents tissue damage ischemia . In ex vivo proof-of-concept , protective effect EPO show human myocardium . The second goal study observe cardioprotective effect increase endogenous EPO , induce normobaric oxygen breathing .</detailed_description>
