	<brief_summary>About 15 20 percent individual live United States chronic abdominal pain , often unknown origin , often difficult diagnose treat . One possible cause chronic abdominal pain inflammation intestine , know whether two related . Furthermore , although overweight people tend likely increase inflammation , know whether connection increase body weight chronic abdominal pain . This study examine relationship symptom chronic abdominal pain intestinal inflammation compare medical test result normal weight overweight patient history chronic abdominal pain . This study include 224 subject , must men woman age 13 45 . Half subject healthy participant , half chronic abdominal pain unknown origin longer 6 month . Female participant must take urine pregnancy test start study , allow participate test positive . During study , patient visit NIH Clinical Center two occasion test . On first visit , patient provide medical history , include information current medication natural remedy tobacco alcohol use , also fill questionnaire provide information symptom , current level gastrointestinal pain , general quality life . The study researcher conduct physical examination , measure patient height weight , draw blood test . Patients ask eat drink anything 8 hour second visit , ask bring bathing suit swim cap Clinical Center . On day visit , patient fill questionnaires provide information symptom , current level gastrointestinal pain , general quality life . Patients also provide blood sample test . Researchers measure patient blood pressure heart rate , height , weight , waist/hip circumference , intra-abdominal measurement . Patients also ask put bath suit swim cap body fat measure use machine call BOD POD . To test gastrointestinal system , patient ask drink sugar-based test solution , researcher collect voided urine next 5 6 hour . ( Patients may drink water time . ) On either Day 1 Day 2 study , patient sip , swish spit additional sweet taste solution . Patients sip , swish , spit different concentration sweet taste solution , total 25 tasting solution . Subjects complete questionnaire sweetness preference relate 25 tasting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective natural history study ass specific gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms pathophysiology chronic abdominal pain unknown origin molecular level . This research test hypothesis chronic abdominal pain unknown etiology inflammatory mechanism . Although increase body weight may associate increased inflammation , unclear increase body weight associate chronic abdominal pain . Accordingly overweight normal weight subject without chronic abdominal pain unknown origin include study . The study design longitudinal natural history . The purpose test relationship abdominal pain symptom intestinal inflammation two group ( overweight normal weight patient chronic abdominal pain unknown origin ) . After obtain informed consent , initial screen history physical exam ensure eligibility perform . The participant abdominal pain , psychological distress , quality life , socio-demographic , co-morbidities assess via questionnaire . Anthropometry , vital sign , fast blood work drawn two visit Clinical Center National Institutes Health clinical screening labs research purpose . There three measure intestinal inflammation include fecal calprotectin , intestinal permeability , serum cytokine IL-6 level . A stool sample collect measure fecal calprotectin . Intestinal permeability measure administration sugar base test solution give orally participant overnight fast second visit . Excreted urine sugar ratio , express per m2 body surface area , measure gastrointestinal permeability . Body mass body fat analysis ( plethysmography ) , intra-abdominal liver ultrasound , Fibroscan measure also collect visit two . On either Day 1 Day 2 study , patient sip , swish spit additional sweet taste solution complete questionnaire sweetness preference related tasting .</detailed_description>
