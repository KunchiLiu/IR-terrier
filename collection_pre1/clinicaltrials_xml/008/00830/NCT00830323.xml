	<brief_summary>Neuraminidase inhibitor ( NAI ) effective anti-influenza antiviral treatment . During use experimentally infected patient , show viral load detect nasal fluid decrease significantly faster non treated patient . During clinical practice , emergence NAI-resistant strain observe . These strain remain rare , emergence seem related mis-use NAI product ( insufficient duration dosage ) . This observation well detection NAI-resistant virus community raise concern putative emergence resistant clone specific context pandemic , use NAI large aim reduce transmission , subsequently impact emerge virus . In context , important determine putative interest alternative strategy . Although zanamivir oseltamivir issue class , combination may lead rapid viral clearance infect case , reduction emergence resistant sub-clones , alternatively , might lead competitive inhibition . The evaluation combination need conduct vivo . Among available anti influenza antiviral , M2 blockers previously use . Although efficacy A H5N1 remain ascertained , use combination NAI also evaluate context preparation possible pandemic determination stockpile . Therefore , evaluation combination therapy treatment virologically suspect influenza investigated primary care winter season 2008-2009 .</brief_summary>
