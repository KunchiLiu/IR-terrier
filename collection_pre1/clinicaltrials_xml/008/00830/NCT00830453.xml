	<brief_summary>The purpose study discover feasibility conduct clinical research individual chronic sequela follow brain injury give hyperbaric oxygen . This study also look outcome individual chronic stable brain injury due trauma , anoxia ( lack oxygen brain ) , stroke , give hyperbaric oxygen . Outcome measure test cognitive ( memory , etc . ) functional ( balance , strength , etc . ) measure perform hyperbaric session , immediately follow , 6 month later . The subject receive 60 hyperbaric session , 60 minute chamber , pressure 1.5 ATA , daily , Monday Friday .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperbaric oxygen presently use attempt improve functional outcome follow multitude brain injury stroke , anoxic brain injury , traumatic brain injury , others . Family member brain-injured individual correspond via Internet coalition demand love one receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy . There anecdotal report benefit hyperbaric oxygen follow brain injury little credible scientific evidence efficacy hyperbaric oxygen brain injury . Clearly , need answer hyperbaric oxygen improve brain injury result carefully design multi-center , prospective , randomize control clinical trial . However , implementation Phase III clinical trial challenge without information Phase II trial . We propose conduct feasibility trial may potentially guide future Phase III clinical trial . Mechanisms hyperbaric oxygen improve sequelae follow brain injury speculative . Hyperbaric oxygen upregulates growth factor receptor sit human endothelium stimulate heal hypoxic wound . It conceivable hyperbaric oxygen exerts similar effect within damage neuronal tissue information lacking . Stem cell present adult brain speculation hyperbaric oxygen may stimulate stem cell generate new neuron , , information speculative . In Phase II feasibility prospective clinical trial , propose recruit enroll 70 brain-injured subject expose daily hyperbaric oxygen 1.5 atmosphere absolute 60 minute per session , 60 session per subject . This research protocol one commonly use practitioner claim benefit hyperbaric oxygen therapy . Before 60 hyperbaric oxygen session , 6 month follow completion hyperbaric oxygen , outcome measure consist neuropsychological testing , functional measure , health-related quality life measure , neurological examination conduct analyzed subject serve control . Important information regard subsequent Phase III clinical trial , include subject recruitment , tolerance risk therapy , dropout rate , potential benefit lack benefit hyperbaric oxygen report .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject brain injury least 12 month prior study enrollment . Subject least 18 year old . Etiology brain injury : Stroke , anoxia , trauma Must able equalize ear , tympanostomy tube Willingness complete outcome measure complies research protocol . Commitment pay hospital hyperbaric oxygen . Glasgow Coma Scores less 13 time hyperbaric oxygen evaluation . Poorly control seizure ( ie : &gt; 1 generalized seizure past 3 month despite appropriate anticonvulsant therapy ) . Pharmacologicallycontrolled seizure focal seizure exclusion participate . Inability participate outcome assessment ( eg : blindness , quadraplegia ) Claustrophobia ( unwillingness inability enter hyperbaric chamber ) . Inability equalize ear . The patient could elect bilateral tympanostomy tube . Inability protect airway , require frequent suctioning . Patients require tracheostomy ineligible due limitation autoinflation middle ear space difficulty perform airway suction singleperson chamber . Pregnancy ( beta HCG assay woman could pregnant prior enrollment ) . Severe psychiatric disorder schizophrenia bipolar disease . We appreciate psychiatric problem depression anxiety may follow brain injury would exclude patient base braininjury induce psychiatric disorder , exclude patient severe preinjury psychiatric disorder . Patients take lithium ( due possibility concomitant toxic side effect hyperbaric oxygen therapy , specifically hyperexcitability ) . Degenerative Mental Disease ( eg : Alzheimer 's , multiple sclerosis , senile dementia , severe psychiatric disorder ( schizophrenia , bipolar disease , etc. ) . Presence chronic debilitate disease ( endstage renal disease , endstage liver disease , diabetes sequela ) . Heart failure patient ejection fraction less 50 % inability lay supine . Patients active malignancy , prior treatment cisplatin bleomycin ( evidence prior cisplatin bleomycin therapy may place patient increase risk serious oxidate stress inhalation high concentration oxygen ) . Evidence current recreational drug use , either history , comprehensive urine drug testing ( due confound outcome measure interpretation ) . Consumption equivalent 12 beers/week habitually . Prior treatment hyperbaric oxygen chronic brain injury within last year . Women childbearing potential</criteria>
