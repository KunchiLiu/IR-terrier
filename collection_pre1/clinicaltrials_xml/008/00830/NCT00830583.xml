	<brief_summary>An international consensual group recommend confirm diagnosis Pompe disease dry blood spot ( DBS ) dosage enzymatic activity tissue . This strategy currently use usual practice . The aim evaluate prevalence Pompe disease among patient progressive limb girdle muscular weakness and/or axial deficiency , and/or respiratory insufficiency . The diagnosis confirm use DBS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pompe Prevalence Study Patients With Muscle Weakness Without Diagnosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Pompe disease , deficiency enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) result accumulation glycogen within lyososomes numerous tissue cell type especially muscular cell . Pompe disease pan ethnic ( increased prevalence afro-American Chinese population ) . Pompe disease rare estimate incidence 1 40,000 birth . In France far , hundred patient diagnose . The difference result epidemiologic study publish number French patient diagnose cause under-diagnostic pathology , rare unknown . The late onset type disease ( childhood adult ) reveal progressive muscle weakness generally begin proximal muscle leg . Respiratory muscle weakness often cause death among patient respiratory insufficiency . Recognizing Pompe disease challenging , sign symptom may share disorder ( limb girdle muscular dystrophy , dystrophinopathy inflammatory myopathy ) . Muscle biopsy often used measure GAA activity histology patient muscle weakness . But glycogen accumulation muscle patient varies biopsy site , diagnosis Pompe disease miss use muscle biopsy . Fibroblasts also serve source material research cell culture facility easy clinician take several week obtain confluent culture . Then , assay use blood diagnose Pompe disease develop . Therefore , group international clinician biologist meet together London December 2006 establish agreement concern various method enzyme dosage . Recently , test DBS ( dry blood spot ) develop . This test invasive , easy collect transport , require small sample volume provide rapid result . This international consensual group recommend confirm diagnosis Pompe disease DBS dosage enzymatic activity tissue . This strategy currently use usual practice .</detailed_description>
