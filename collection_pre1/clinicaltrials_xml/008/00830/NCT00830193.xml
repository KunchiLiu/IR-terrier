	<detailed_description>Potential participant identify staff intensivists resident physician follow admission participate ICUs . We include critically ill adult patient least 18 year age consent participate trial , central venous access foley catheter , require contrast-enhanced CT organ system ( ) , consider 'at risk ' development CIN . We define 'at risk ' include patient least one follow time randomization ( ) serum creatinine &gt; 106 µmol/L urea &gt; 6 mmol/L , ( ii ) urine output &lt; 0.5 cc/kg &gt; 4 hr ( iii ) increase serum creatinine &gt; 50 µmol/L &lt; 24 hour . We stratify base presence absence diabetes define history treatment oral hypoglycemics insulin . We exclude patient ( ) CK &gt; 5,000 presence myoglobinuria , ( ii ) know allergy hypersensitivity reaction radiographic contrast dye NAC , ( iii ) serious illness imminent threat die ( low likelihood survival within 48-hours ) poor prognosis , ( iv ) pregnancy , ( v ) patient cardiogenic shock ( NYHA class 3 4 symptom ) , ( vi ) know suspected nephritic , nephrotic pulmonary-renal syndrome , ( vii ) post renal etiology renal impairment , ( viii ) previous renal transplant , ( ix ) know solitary kidney , ( x ) serum creatinine &gt; 200 µmol/L ( xi ) recent exposure radiographic contrast within 14 day randomization . The primary outcome study development CIN define rise serum creatinine &gt; 50 µmol/L time randomization day 5 follow contrast exposure . Secondary outcome include ICU hospital length stay , ICU hospital mortality requirement renal replacement therapy . We record compliance assign treatment assess development severe unexpected adverse event define hypotension , bronchospasm anaphylactic reaction .</detailed_description>
