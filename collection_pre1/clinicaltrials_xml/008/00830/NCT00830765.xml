	<brief_summary>Preterm birth common costly complication obstetrics . It complicate 11 % pregnancy responsible 70 % sick baby . Recently two study show give progesterone ( normal hormone make ovary ) prolongs gestation woman preterm birth earlier pregnancy ( therefore risk another early delivery ) . There study show technique give weekly shot progesterone prevent preterm birth . In addition , There group patient high risk preterm birth study . They include : 1 . ) Cervical cerclage ( stitch mouth womb ) ; 2 . ) Multifetal gestation ( twin , triplet , etc . ) ; 3 . ) Women preterm ( &lt; 34 week ) rupture membrane ; 4 . ) Women preterm labor current pregnancy intact membrane tocolyzed ( labor stop get ready go home ) . We purpose give weekly shot progesterone placebo randomize fashion woman first group risk preterm delivery due early birth previous pregnancy well four group list . If progesterone give weekly successful prevent early delivery compare placebo group great benefit woman well future pregnancy would accrue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Progesterone Reduce Preterm Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . Introduction Preterm birth occur 7-12 % delivery , account 85 % perinatal morbidity mortality.1 Despite many strategy reduce incidence preterm birth none totally effective . One treatment show promise earlier small trial prophylactic administration progestational compounds.2,3 However , report efficacy mixed show benefits4,5 others not.6,7 More recently , two randomize clinical trial show great promise8,9 , reveal significant decrease preterm birth among woman receive 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate ( 17P ) 8 , 100mg progesterone deliver vaginal suppository per week.9 Indeed support American College Obstetricians Gynecologists , March Dimes well others make treatment standard care many area country . The limitation study small number well higher expect preterm delivery rate among placebo patient . Because previous controversy effectiveness progesterone note 70 's - 80 's incumbent upon center carry new investigational trial effort confirm result . Secondly , study limit singleton pregnancy `` risk '' preterm delivery thus survey three group high preterm delivery rate : 1 . ) Multifetal gestation cervical insufficiency ; 2 . ) Those preterm labor current pregnancy tocolyzed ; 3 . ) Women preterm premature rupture membrane . The purpose current study confirm possible , findings recent investigations8,9 use patient population addition , study effect progesterone v placebo prevent early delivery among multifetal gestation woman diagnose preterm labor current pregnancy . B . Specific Aim The aim study compare progesterone ( 100mg progesterone weekly ) ascertain reduction preterm birth subsequent neonatal morbidity among patient receive active drug . If weekly treatment agent show reduce incidence preterm delivery surrogate adverse outcome neonate , major impact upon patient health care delivery system . C. Rationale Progesterone indicate Introduction show , , study reduce incidence preterm delivery adverse effect prematurity . Progesterone show reduce number oxytocin receptor myometrium responsible near term pregnant woman block onset labor . Weekly use compound , effective , would much superior tocolytic agent currently available . D. Benefit Risk Ratio There know harm mother/fetus/infant progesterone therapy . This compound use early pregnancy risk abortion well later pregnancy reduce incidence prematurity note Introduction . On beneficial side , treatment prof effective could prolong pregnancy thus reduce significant neonatal morbidity well emotional cost expense pregnancy . E. Patient Population Patients recruit University Mississippi Medical Center Perinatal Clinics , Antepartum Service Labor Delivery area . All patient meet admission criterion offer participation study . F. Materials Methods Patients see University Mississippi Perinatal Clinics , Antepartum ward Labor Delivery area preterm labor risk preterm labor meet admission criterion ( without exclusion criterion ) offer participation study . Study Protocol Patients meeting inclusion criterion study explain , include benefit risk alternative therapy . Patients desire participate study receive current regimen preterm birth prevention ( observation , risk factor assessment , steroid , progesterone , etc ) . If accept inclusion study explanation randomize use sequentially number , seal opaque envelope either receive progesterone placebo injection weekly basis . Patients risk factor preterm birth ( prior preterm birth ) separately randomize multifetal gestation cervical cerclage patient preterm labor current pregnancy well preterm rupture membrane also separately randomize ( four group total ) . Neither patient participant know group ( placebo vs. progesterone ) assign pharmacy keep randomization schedule dispense two solution identical syrinx blind purpose . Treatment begin different gestational age dependent upon four group note . For example , multifetal gestation due incidence labor earlier gestational age , begin treatment 20 week ' gestation . Those preterm labor current pregnancy group premature rupture membrane begin therapy admission hospital follow stabilization . All patient stop therapy 34 complete week gestation . After inclusion study , prenatal care exactly standard patient risk early delivery exception weekly administration study medicine placebo . For example , weekly prenatal visit , cervical examination , ultrasound , steroid and/or tocolytic treatment ( give preterm labor diagnose ) regardless group patient randomize . All group one tube blood drawn placental cord time delivery . There additional visit cost due study . F. Data Analysis Data analysis standard statistical methodology . VI . Number Patients Needed : A sample size estimation indicate 320 patient ( 40 four groups-treatment placebo ) necessary 80 % power detect significance &lt; 0.05 number preterm birth . It anticipate time period approximately two year need enroll number participant .</detailed_description>
