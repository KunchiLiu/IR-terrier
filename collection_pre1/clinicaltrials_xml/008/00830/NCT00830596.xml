	<detailed_description>In collaboration University Iowa , Palmer Center Chiropractic Research pursue follow specific aim : 1 ) To determine immediate pre-to-post change HVLA-SM LVVA-SM lumbo-pelvic region , compare control group receive light effleurage sham mechanically assisted adjustment , sensorimotor function measure : lumbo-pelvic repositioning ability , stand postural sway , response sudden trunk loading ; 2 ) To determine effect 2 week ( 4 application @ 2 per week ) HVLA-SM LVVA-SM lumbo-pelvic region , compare control group receive light effleurage sham mechanically assisted adjustment , sensorimotor function measure : lumbo-pelvic repositioning ability , stand postural sway response sudden trunk loading ; 3 ) To determine effect 6 week ( 12 application @ 2 per week ) HVLA-SM LVVA-SM lumbo-pelvic region sensorimotor function measure : Lumbo-pelvic repositioning ability , stand postural sway , response sudden truck loading ; 4 ) To explore whether change sensorimotor function associate change self-reported back pain intensity , related disability , health status 2 week ( 4 SM Visits ) 6 week ( 12 SM Visits ) ; 5 ) To determine sensorimotor function change great patient priori clinically classified appropriate manipulation . ; 6 ) Describe sensorimotor clinical effect 4 week full spine extremity ( clinician 's choice ) care follow 2 week receive light effleurage sham mechanically assist adjustment participant low back pain ; 7 ) To explore association : a. DC characterization quality SM ( rat survey ) biomechanics SM ( measure force-time profile , biomechanical assessment , videotape ) , b. DC participant characterization quality SM ( rat survey ) .</detailed_description>
