	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy use year treat patient breast cancer whose primary tumor large allow breast conservation surgery [ 1 ] . Reduction size primary tumor neoadjuvant chemotherapy make possible use lumpectomy instead mastectomy large fraction case . In past major objective neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer , recently focus changed goal expand [ 2 ] include : 1- determination chemosensitivity tumor subsequent chemotherapy modify accordingly . 2- prolong disease free survival . 3- prolong survival . So far consistent improvement survival use approach , although two recent study suggest survival benefit might actually occur [ 3 , 4 ] . However , consensus patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieve `` pathological CR '' , mean tumor find time definitive tumor resection , experience long survival [ 5-8 ] . Perhaps active neoadjuvant combination significantly high pathological CR rate obtain , thus longer survival achieve . Most neoadjuvant regimen use past included induction 3-4 course anthracycline base regimen without Taxane , follow surgery chemotherapy subsequently . However , incorporation docetaxel anthracycline-based regimen ( Aberdeen NSABP-B27 protocol ) [ 4 , 9 ] lead well clinical response , subsequently well breast conservation important , increase pathological complete response rate . In NSABP-B-27 study , 2,411 patient operable primary breast cancer randomly assign one three treatment arm : ) four cycle preoperative AC follow surgery . b ) four cycle preoperative AC follow four cycle preoperative docetaxel ( 100 mg/m2 IV every 3 week ) , c ) four cycle AC follow surgery subsequently four cycle postoperative docetaxel . Compared preoperative AC alone , preoperative AC follow preoperative docetaxel increase clinical complete response rate ( 40.1 % v 63.6 % ; P &lt; .001 ) , overall clinical response rate ( 85.5 % v 90.7 % ; P &lt; .001 ) , pathologic complete response rate ( 13.7 % v 26.1 % ; P &lt; .001 ) , proportion patient negative node ( 50.8 % v 58.2 % ; P &lt; .001 ) . Improvement relapse free survival also observe NSABP-B-27 Aberdeen trial . In latter trial , improvement overall survival also reported.. A statistically significant improvement overall survival observe yet NSABP-B-27 trial longer follow-up study require well evaluate impact include Taxotere ( Docetaxel ) part neoadjuvant strategy overall survival breast cancer . One subgroup patient NSABP-B-27 trial find retrospective analysis benefit . This group achieve clinical partial response first four course AC receive four additional course Docetaxel . They benefit long disease free survival . In another neoadjuvant trial perform MD Anderson Cancer Center , patient pathologic response residual tumor &gt; 1 cm randomize receive postoperative chemotherapy base response preoperative chemotherapy . Those patient change chemotherapy experienced long survival . A review neoadjuvant trial show high number preop chemotherapy course best result . We feel next step development preoperative combination chemotherapeutic regimen provide high pathological complete response rate high lymph node negative status . In study propose : 1- incorporate Docetaxel part induction neoadjuvant regimen patient . 2- tailor neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen accord preoperative response judge MRI patient whose maximum response first four course anthracycline-docetaxel base combination , partial remission less , receive four course non-cross resistant regimen . 3- prolong duration neoadjuvant preoperative chemotherapy total eight course . 4- complete neoadjuvant chemotherapy surgery chance pathological CR increase . 5- include Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) part neoadjuvant treatment patient Her-2 positive . A combination derive establish TAC ( Taxotere , Adriamycin , Cyclophosphamide ) regimen use Epirubicin , less cardiotoxic analogue Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) , test . Those Her-2 negative patient whose response first 4 course induction TEC le complete remission , treatment change second line regimen , Navelbine-Avastin-Xeloda ( `` NAX '' ) , intention capture good response prior surgery . Those Her-2 positive initially also receive TEC subsequent therapy include Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) whether respond well TEC .</detailed_description>
