	<brief_summary>The goal propose study contrast relative efficacy closed-cell stent versus open-cell stent prevent periprocedural cerebral embolization high-risk patient symptomatic asymptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis undergo carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke responsible 10 % death much severe disability develop country . In United States , approximately 600,000 new stroke report annually , 150,000 fatal , 4,000,000 survive stroke victim affect significant disability . Seventy-five percent stroke occur distribution carotid artery consider thromboembolic etiology , originate carotid lesion . Carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) cerebral embolic protection currently prefer treatment carotid stenosis high risk surgical patient , i.e. , significant comorbidities hostile neck previous surgical procedure radiation . Although several predictor adverse outcome CAS identify , effect device characteristic , include stent design , neurologic adverse event establish . The propose study randomize prospective control trial design test hypothesis implantation closed-cell stent carotid lesion high-risk patient associate reduced perioperative cerebral microembolization , detect transcranial Doppler diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging brain , reduce 30-day stroke , myocardial infarction , death rate compare implantation open-cell stent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject high risk carotid endarterectomy due either anatomic comorbid condition ; AND Symptomatic patient ( TIA nondisabling stroke within 6 month procedure ) , carotid stenosis ≥ 50 % diagnosed angiography , use NASCET methodology ( 50 ) ; OR Asymptomatic patient carotid stenosis ≥ 80 % diagnosed angiography , use NASCET methodology Conditions interfere evaluation endpoint Subject anticipate potential source cardiac embolus Subject plan major surgical procedure within 30 day index procedure . Subject intracranial pathology make subject inappropriate study participation . Subject total occlusion ipsilateral carotid artery ( i.e. , CCA ) . Severe circumferential lesion calcification may restrict full deployment carotid stent . Carotid stenosis locate distal target stenosis severe target stenosis .</criteria>
