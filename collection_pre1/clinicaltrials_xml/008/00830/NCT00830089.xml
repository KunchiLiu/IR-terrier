	<brief_summary>Keyhole surgery bowel disease bring great benefit , enable patient recover quick surgery return normal activity . Although keyhole surgery reduces pain follow abdominal surgery , still cause enough pain require strong pain kill medication morphine-like drug , although good pain killer , detrimental effect recovery bowel function , leading feeling nausea vomit ultimately delay recovery . These side-effects reduce potential benefit keyhole surgery `` fast-track '' recovery programmes . The aim project ass effectiveness new method pain control keyhole bowel surgery . The study involve injection local anaesthetic abdominal muscle patient anaesthetise . Although use local anaesthetic common practice , look new technique injecting call transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block . This technique attempt block pain nerve abdomen prior operation begin . We plan investigate whether new technique reduce amount pain follow keyhole bowel surgery . If successful , might use enhance people 's recovery bowel surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Transversus Abdominis Plane ( TAP ) Block Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A considerable component post-operative pain follow abdominal surgery arise anterior abdominal wall . Although laparoscopic surgery show reduce post-operative pain score compare open surgery , still problem abdominal pain arising , particular , specimen extraction site . Commonly use regime counter pain include intravenous opiate-based patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pump , although drug detrimental effect post-operative recovery bowel function lead increase risk post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) . The consequence gastrointestinal complication benefit patient laparoscopic surgery enhanced recovery programme fully realise . The benefit adequate postoperative analgesia include reduction postoperative stress response , reduction postoperative morbidity , colorectal surgery , improved surgical outcome . Other benefit effective regional analgesic technique include reduce pain intensity , decrease incidence side effect analgesic ( PONV ) , improve patient comfort . The innervation anterior abdominal wall come nerve afferent T6-L1 run neurovascular plane find internal oblique transversus abdominis ( TA ) . The transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block aim block nerve local anaesthetic pierce anterior abdominal wall . It already show effective reduce pain first 24 hour laparotomy compare PCA opiates show potential series patient undergoing radical prostatectomy . The potential improvement technique weigh added risk inject neurovascular plane . There theoretical risk significant flank haematoma result injury small vessel run nerve . In addition small risk inadvertent peritoneal puncture although risk subsequent significant injury small would likely detected time subsequent laparoscopy . Although one case report needle puncture liver due previously unknown hepatomegaly , injury detect laparotomy consequence insignificant . Experimental Methods Design Patients would randomise receive either 20mls local anaesthetic side abdomen TA plane receive additional treatment . Both group would receive local anaesthetic wound end procedure . The TAP block would take place induction anaesthesia commencement surgery . The TAP block would carry standardised manner use ultrasound guidance two experienced anaesthetist considerable experience technique . For blind purpose , site entry skin TAP block cover plaster , irrespective whether block give . A standardised anaesthetic standard post-operative analgesia regimen give group . Patients withdrawn analysis colorectal resection take place surgery convert open procedure , although data continue collect .</detailed_description>
