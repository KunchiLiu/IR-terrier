	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Raltegravir Plus Darunavir/Ritonavir Treatment-Naive HIV-Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite remarkable stride make treatment HIV-1-infected person last decade , current first-line ART regimen imperfect . The ideal combination , unlike current first-line option , would uncompromised efficacy presence transmit drug-resistant variant . The primary purpose study estimate cumulative proportion ART-naive participant experience virologic failure prior week 24 initiating raltegravir ( RAL ) plus darunavir/ritonavir ( DRV/RTV ) . The study last 52 week . All participant follow treatment schedule take RAL plus DRV/RTV orally daily duration trial . After entry , participant schedule visit week 1 , 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 52 . Medical/medication history , blood urine collection , liver function test occur screen . A targeted physical exam concomitant medication history occur study visit . Blood urine collection liver function test occur study visit . For female , pregnancy test occur screen study entry . RAL DRV provide study . RTV provide study .</detailed_description>
