	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic nicotine exposure cigarette smoking affect level brain chemical dopamine . Smokers attempt quit experience low level dopamine , increase anxiety trigger nicotine craving make quit difficult . - Varenicline ( Chantix ) smoke cessation medication design reduce nicotine crave withdrawal slightly increase level dopamine brain . Research show varenicline safe , well-tolerated , effective treatment nicotine dependence , researcher interest learn affect brain function . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) help researcher study brain response nicotine varenicline . Objectives : - To explore varenicline affect brain function behavioral performance current smoker healthy volunteer . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 55 year age either current smoker ( 10 cigarette per day ) healthy nonsmoking volunteer . Design : - The study involve nine test research visit 5 6 week . The first visit provide initial assessment training task complete study . - Six test visit involve fMRI EEG measurement brain activity . Each visit contain two 2-hour scanning session , session involve thinking test . During visit , participant receive varenicline placebo tablet , wear nicotine patch placebo patch contain nicotine . Participants tell tablet patch give . This crossover study participant eventually get nicotine placebo , well varenicline placebo . - Two visit involve different thinking task . These visit require fMRI EEG scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective . Chronic nicotine exposure think lead alteration dopamine ( DA ) system leave smoker hypo-dopaminergic state period abstinence . Varenicline ( Chantix ) , new efficacious smoke cessation medication , think lead modest sustained increase DA release thereby reduce nicotine craving withdrawal . While numerous study show varenicline safe , well-tolerated , effective pharmacological treatment nicotine dependence , study explore neurophysiological impact drug human brain conduct . This protocol utilize array reward process cognitive control task explore effect subtle DA manipulation ( induced smoking cessation , transdermal nicotine , varenicline ) brain function behavioral performance . Brain function assess use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) . Study Population . There two study population : 1 ) healthy nicotine-dependent adult smoke 10 cigarette per day ; 2 ) healthy non-smoking , non-drug dependent control . Participants must generally healthy , right-handed , male non-pregnant/non-lactating female age 18-55 . Design . After medically clear give informed consent , participant complete several image visit ( 6 visit , separate day ) take varenicline . Two visit take place varenicline administration ( baseline ) , two visit two-week varenicline dosing period ( post-varenicline ) , another two two-week placebo-pill period ( post-placebo-pill ) . Each set two scan involve randomize , double blind administration nicotine transdermal placebo patch . fMRI EEG data collect patch application involve several task design probe brain region corticolimbic circuit may mediate aspect reward-processing , learning , attention , goal-directed behavior , drug abuse . Outcome Measures . This study involve assess neurophysiological behavior difference cohort ( smoker vs. non-smokers ) condition ( nicotine vs. placebo-patch ; baseline vs. varenicline vs. placebo-pill ) . The primary outcome measure use ascertain difference : 1 ) percentage change fMRI BOLD signal performance cognitive control reward processing task ; 2 ) change ERP component ( e.g. , error-related negativity ) amplitudes ; 3 ) behavioral measure task performance include reaction time error rate ; 4 ) score mood , personality , smoke questionnaire ; 5 ) variation gene relate nicotinic receptor DA functioning .</detailed_description>
