	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether innovative multimedia educational program help newly diagnose prostate ( project 1 ) breast ( project 2 ) cancer patient prepare journey cancer patient , promote inform treatment decision-making reduce cancer-specific distress , among breast cancer patient re-entry , facilitate inform re-entry transition cancer survivorship reduce cancer-specific distress ( project 3 ) . - Determine whether Cancer Information Service ( CIS ) Information Specialists make schedule telephone callback caller project 3 augment support use CIS Research Consortium ( CISRC ) multimedia educational program enhance study outcome examine program research . - Determine whether hypothesize mediational variable account significant intervention effect three component project . - Examine potential moderator variable assess potential difference intervention efficacy select subgroup ( e.g. , age , education ) within component project . - Conduct in-depth tracking study utilization pattern detailed description different pattern use , well elucidate component module within program differential utilization participant . - Assist CIS similar cancer information system disseminate one CISRC intervention prove effective program research . Secondary - Conduct secondary analysis across project ( i.e. , perceive need benefit CISRC intervention intervention efficacy across three high priority cancer patient population ) make possible use common theoretical framework , similar intervention research design across project , common set endpoint . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assess demographic question baseline interview conduct Cancer Information Service ( CIS ) Information Specialists .
