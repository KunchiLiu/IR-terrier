	<detailed_description>I . Introduction A . Background Lung unit participate gas exchange know 'recruited ' lung . Patients lung injury suffer proportion unit participate gas exchange ( i.e . derecruited state ) , time result impaired gas exchange . Derecruitment alveolus may also cause intrapulmonary shunt worsen lung injury atelectotrauma7 . Outcomes acute respiratory distress syndrome improve significantly Is really true ? since clinician begin employ lung protective strategy , include low-tidal volume ventilation permissive hypercapnea8 , 9 . However , low-tidal volume ventilation recognize decrease recruit lung volume , phenomenon persists despite aggressive positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) strategy employ ARDSNet studies4 . Atelectasis associate low-tidal volume ventilation relieve use so-called sign breath , recruitment breaths10 . Further , proportion lung remain derecruited state may contribute morbidity mortality associate acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) 11 . In adult , several strategy utilize recruit lung : sustain inflation ( SI ) maximal recruitment strategy . The so-called open lung approach ( OLA ) include SI follow set PEEP measure low inflection point PV curve . An alternative approach set PEEP decremental PEEP titration , include sequential lower PEEP predetermine decrement PaO2 SaO2 occur . Studies include strategy maintain lung recruitment follow recruitment maneuver study . The impact lung recruitment long-term course ARDS yet clear . It clear lung recruitment effective early course ALI/ARDS . Grasso et al demonstrated patient receive recruitment maneuver day 1±0.3 ARDS could recruit , versus patient recruit day 7±1 . Similarly , Gattinoni et al11 Crotti et al5 find limited recruitment patient well along course ARDS . Borges et al,6 Tugrul et al,12 Girgis et al recruit patient early course ARDS , find mark lung recruitment , average , patient study . Each study demonstrated ability improve oxygen saturation ( sometimes study ) end-expiratory lung volume . While study examine effect change morbidity mortality , child hypoxemia know common cause morbidity . Importantly child , treatment hypoxia often drive escalate ventilator setting , use high frequency oscillatory ventilation ( HFOV ) use extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . Early recruitment child ALI/ARDS may prevent need escalation care towards invasive , risk-imposing therapy . Currently , clinical practice guideline standard care regard lung recruitment strategy child lung injury . To date , study perform child document efficacy safety strategy utilize intensive care . The primary aim study demonstrate efficacy safety sustain inflation maximal recruitment maneuver child lung injury . B . Lung Recruitment Maneuvers 1 . Sustained Inflations ( SI ) Sustained inflation ( SI ) commonly utilized intensive care unit recruitment maneuver . In SI , patient give prolong positive pressure breath ( usually 30 45 cm H2O ) last 15 40 second . Clinically , maneuver apply follow derecruitment , suction , patient exhibit hypoxemia . This strategy currently employ Children 's Hospital Boston Medical-Surgical Intensive Care Unit patient lung injury , though publish evidence safety efficacy child . Could put 3 SI study premature infant use 20-40 cmH20 follow CPAP ? 1 rabbit study . The study describe regard sustain inflation recruitment maneuver . 1 . Tugrul , et al12 study effect SI 24 adult ARDS . SI include 45 cm H2O 30 second , follow decremental PEEP titration 20 cm H2O , titrate saturation . P/F ratio increase &gt; 200 11/24 patient , persist 6 hour post-maneuver 9/24 patient . Barotrauma observe patient . 2 . Richard , et al studied4 effect SI ( 45 cm H2O 15 second ) 10 adult ARDS ventilate low-tidal volume strategy . The maneuver induce significant increase recruit lung volume ( 175±108 ml pre-maneuver versus 254±137 ml post-maneuver ) . This improvement associate increase arterial oxygen saturation . There report sustainability recruitment , adverse effect . 3 . Lapinski , et al13 study safety efficacy SI maneuver 14 adult ARDS . The pressure utilized maneuver less 45 cm H2O plateau pressure utilize 12 mL/kg tidal volume breath ; maneuver hold 20 second . Oxygen saturation increase 86.9 ± 5.5 94.3 ± 2.3 % 10 minute , maintain 4 hour 10/14 patient . The four saturation fell PEEP level 10 cm H2O . The systolic blood pressure decrease 20 second inflation patient , mean change 6.9 mm Hg , reverse rapidly follow release maneuver patient . No barotrauma note patient 24 hour followup . 4 . Pelosi , et al10 study effect three consecutive 'sigh ' breath ( one plateau pressure 45 cm H2O normal duration ) 10 adult ARDS . After 1 hour 3 sigh breath per minute , end-expiratory lung volume ( measure He dilution ) increase 1.49±0.58 1.91±0.67 L , increase PaO2 92.8±18.6 137.6±23.9 mm Hg , compare ventilator setting without sigh breath . Lung elastance ventilation also increase . No adverse effect note . 5 . Toth , et al study cardiac respiratory change occur SI ( 40 cm H2O 40 second ) 18 adult ARDS . The PaO2 increase pre-recruiting maneuver follow 60 minute followup period ( 203±108 vs. 322±101 mm Hg , p &lt; .001 ) . Cardiac index ( CI ) intrathoracic blood volume ( ITBV ) decrease follow recruit maneuver ( CI , 3.90±1.04 vs. 3.62±0.91 L/min/m2 , p &lt; .05 ; ITBVI , 832±205 vs. 795±188 mL/m2 , p &lt; .05 ) . There correlation CI mean arterial pressure , significant change occur mean arterial blood pressure . 6 . In perhaps large study sustain inflation protective ventilation era , Meade , et al14 study 983 adult ARDS utilize lung protective strategy ( tidal volumes 6 mL/kg ) group . The experimental group utilize SI recruitment maneuver ( 40 cm H2O 40 second ) , high level PEEP ( 14.6±3.4 so-called 'lung open ventilation ' group versus 9.8±2.7 control group ) , high plateau pressure ( 30.2±6.3 versus 24.9±5.1 cm H2O ) control group , utilize recruitment maneuver . While difference all-cause mortality , experimental group lower rate refractory hypoxemia ( 4.6 % vs 10.2 % ; RR , 0.54 ) , death refractory hypoxemia ( 4.2 % vs 8.9 % ; RR , 0.56 ) , less frequent use escalate therapy ( define high frequency ventilation , inhale nitric oxide , jet ventilation , extra-corporeal support ) ( 5.1 % vs 9.3 % ; RR , 0.6 ) . This lend credence notion effective recruitment child early acute lung injury may avert escalation therapy decrease mortality due severe hypoxia . 2 . Pressure control ventilation ( PCV ) recruitment maneuver In contrast SI , ventilate patient increase plateau pressure increase PEEP level also use recruit maneuver . In case , patient temporarily place high ventilator pressure would use ventilate patient otherwise . A combination PEEP plateau pressure help recruit atelectatic alveolus . Pressure control ventilation mode choice patient plateau pressure set , therefore keep constant ( contrast volume control ventilation ) . Thus , know plateau pressure ( participate lung recruitment ) deliver . Following salient study utilize PCV recruitment maneuver . ? Athanasios `` TLC maneuver '' anesthetize child ? Small study treat intraoperative atelectisis . 1 . Borges , Amato , et al6 perform convince complete study maximal recruitment maneuver date . In , study 26 adult early course ARDS compare open lung approach ( include SI 40 cm H2O 40 second , follow PEEP set Pflex + 2 cm H2O , describe ) maximal recruitment strategy , perform sequence . Maximal recruitment define PaO2 plus PaCO2 exceed 400 mm Hg , indicative minimal intrapulmonary shunting . The strategy include pressure control ventilation 15 cm H2O , PEEP increase 5 cm H2O increment every 5 minute ( maximum PEEP 45 cm H2O ) maximal recruitment achieve . Maximal recruitment achieve 24/26 patient , two third achieve PEEP 30 cm H2O . Utilizing PEEP titration maintain lung recruitment ( see ) , PaO2 remain 400 ( lung fully recruit ) patient 6 hour . The procedure tolerate hemodynamically patient long-term incidence barotrauma study patient ( 7.7 % ) low recognize incidence ARDSNet study ( 10-11 % ) 8 . 2 . Crotti , et al5 study five adult ALI/ARDS vary plauteau pressure ( 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 35 , 40 , 45 cm H2O ) PEEP level ( 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 cm H2O ) . End-inspiratory end-expiratory thoracic CT imaging obtain combination plateau pressure PEEP . Percentage lung recruit ( determine radiographically ) increase nearly linear fashion increase plateau pressure ( Figure 1 ) . The maximal opening frequency occur 20 cm H2O , suggest plateau pressure exceed 20 cm H2O would beneficial lung recruitment . No measure gas exchange adverse event study . 3 . Foti , et al15 compare change oxygenation end-expiratory lung volume increase PEEP level superimpose volume control ventilation versus sustain inflation maneuver 15 adult ARDS . Although recruitment variable ( due use VCV , hence variable plateau pressure ) , find maximal increase oxygenation occur high sustain level PEEP ( mean 16 cm H2O 30 minute ) compare 30 second recruitment maneuver low PEEP ( mean 9 cm H2O ) . The PEEP/plateau protocol associate hemodynamic alteration , sustain inflation maneuver . 4 . Villagra , et al , study recruit maneuver utilize 2 minute ventilation use pressure-controlled ventilation ( PCV ) 18 adult early ARDS . For RM , PEEP set 3 cm H2O upper inflection point PV curve , peak pressure set 50 . Importantly , RM peak pressure differ significantly baseline ventilation ( 43.6±7.6 pre-RM , 47±4.5 RM , 42.8±7.1 cm H2O post-RM ) , although PEEP ( 14±1.3 pre-RM v 30±4.9 cm H2O ) . The investigator find significant difference PaO2 follow recruit maneuver ( 127±63 pre-RM , 162±108 , 149±85 cm H2O post-RM ) . This finding implies several important finding regard lung recruitment . First , peak pressure represent significant determinant lung recruitment . By contrast , Borges , et al able fully recruit 18 ARDS patient use drive pressure differ significantly pre-RM maximal recruitment phase ( 50-60 cm H2O recruitment v 30 cm H2O baseline ) . Further , recruit maneuver utilize 2 minute , versus incremental titration utilized Borges last 4 minute phase . While systematically study , lack significant improvement PaO2 post-RM find study suggest recruitment utilize PCV may function time peak pressure utilized RM . 5 . Medoff,3 et al present single patient refractory hypoxemia . Management include repeat sustained inflation PEEP set Pflex base PV curve . A recruiting maneuver include 20 cm H2O PEEP 40 cm H2O distending pressure 2 minute perform . The patient exhibit marked improvement oxygenation near-complete recruitment lung CT scan ( see Figure 2 ) . 6 . While aforementioned study achieve successful recruitment , Gattinoni , et al11 study 68 adult late ARDS ( 5±6 day ventilation enrollment ) fail successfully recruit . Recruitment maneuver include pressure-controlled ventilation peak pressure 45 cm H2O , PEEP 5 cm H2O , respiratory rate 10 . PEEP level subsequently apply random order , 5 15 cm H2O . He find study patient 13±11 % recruitable lung CT scan . Amongst patient , find 24 % lung tissue non-recruitable , even airway pressure 45 cm H2O . No marker gas exchange measure . It important note three aspect study likely responsible excessively high percentage non-recruitable lung , contrast highly successful recruitment strategy outline Borges , et al . First , Borges study patient early ARDS course ( median , 2 day ) Gattinoni study late ARDS . Second , Borges utilize peak pressure high 60 cm H2O , Gattinoni utilize pressure 45 cm H2O . Finally , Gattinoni practice PEEP titration , lower PEEP 5 cm H2O follow recruitment maneuver . Thus , Gattinoni 's study highlight importance high peak pressure lung recruitment , recruit early ARDS , decremental PEEP titration maintain lung recruitment . C. Strategies Maintaining Recruitment The application positive end-expiratory pressure know prevent repetitive derecruitment-recruitment stress lung tissue . In animal model acute lung injury , Farias show histologic biochemical evidence atelectotrauma avert PEEP apply follow lung recruitment7 . The two principal strategy prevent derecruitment follow recruitment maneuver include open lung approach decremental PEEP titration . 1 . Open Lung Approach In open lung approach , PEEP set low inflection point ( also know Pflex ) patient 's pressure-volume curve . This theoretically prevent PEEP decrease zone underdistension . 1 . In second part study mention , Richard , et al4 also study effect increase PEEP relative measure LIP ( LIP + 4 cm H2O , SI ) compare PEEP set low inflection point follow SI . In 10 adult ventilate low-tidal volume ventilation , measure lung volume 175±108 PEEPLIP versus 332±91 ml PEEPLIP+4 . This increase even notable patient ventilate high tidal volume ( 10 mL/kg ) , demonstrate role plateau pressure ( addition PEEP ) alveolar recruitment ( see Figure 3 ) . 2 . Amato , et al16 study effect 'protective ventilation strategy ' 53 patient ARDS . The protective ventilation group receive recruitment maneuver via sustain inflation ( 35-40 cm H2O 40 second ) follow PEEP set LIP + 2 cm H2O . The control group receive PEEP titrate saturation , recruit maneuver . The protective ventilation group dramatic decrease 28 day all-cause mortality ( 38 % vs 71 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) . However , control group also receive high tidal volume ventilation ( 12 mL/kg ) , later prove significant determinant ARDS mortality.8 Therefore , contribution RM open lung approach improve mortality study , , difficult conclude . 2 . Decremental PEEP Titration In decremental PEEP titration , follow recruit maneuver , PEEP set high level , often 20 26 cm H2O . PEEP decrease incrementally , marker lung inflation ( e.g . gas exchange measure lung volume ) follow . When evidence atelectasis occur , PEEP hold level , often term 'optimal PEEP . ' 1 . Borges , Amato , et al6 describe PEEP titration follow maximal recruitment protocol compare open lung approach ( PEEP set Pflex + 2 cm H2O ) . Following maximal recruitment strategy ( describe ) , PEEP set 25 cm H2O decrease 2 cm H2O every 4 minute PaO2 + PaCO2 &lt; 380 mm Hg , increase 2 cm H2O ( optimal PEEP , mean 20±5 cm H2O ) . Using strategy , PaO2 sustain level 400 mm Hg 30 minute followup 24 patient ( see Figure 4 , top ) , 450 16 patient follow 6 hour . This correlated percent mass collapse tissue measure CT scan &lt; 5 % end PEEP titration 30 minute followup ( see Figure 4 , bottom ) . 2 . Toth , et al17 describe decremental PEEP titration follow SI recruit maneuver . Following SI 40 cm H2O 40 second , PEEP set 26 cm H2O , decrease 2 cm H2O every 4 minute PaO2 decrease &gt; 10 % peak value . The PEEP 2 cm H2O define optimal PEEP . Optimal PEEP find actually low patient ' baseline PEEP ( prior protocol initiation , 17±3 v 15±4 cm H2O ) . The PaO2 follow recruit maneuver ( 203±108 baseline PEEP v 328±132 cm H2O ) sustain 30 minute followup period ( 266±121 cm H2O , p &lt; 0.05 compare baseline ) . D. Estimating Lung Volumes Currently , ability determine whether patient , ideal functional residual capacity deduce surrogate measurement , include lung appearance chest radiograph , vital sign trend ( particularly oxygenation ) , pressure-volume ( P-V ) curve generated modern ventilator . In study , utilize establish method determine lung volume ( MBNW ) study lung volume . 1 . Pressure-Volume Curves The pressure-volume curve represent continual relationship change pressure change volume lung . The slope line represent compliance lung . In Figure 5 , note three line comprise inspiratory limb ( low curve ) . The leftmost line represent noncompliant , atelectatic lung . The point slope change know low infection point , also know Pflex . In open lung approach ( discussed later ) , PEEP set pressure low inflection point . Physiologically , hypothesize point atelectatic segment lung recruit , disallow ventilator pressure drop point ( set PEEP level ) minimize atelectasis . The point distinguishes second change slope line ( become flat ) know upper inflection point ( UIP ) . Pressures point represent overdistended , noncompliant alveolus , thus point represent pressure compliance lung decrease dramatically . In protocol , PV curve measure patient UIP utilize ceiling pressure point protocol . In way , recruit compliant area lung without risk overdistension . 2 . Nitrogen Multiple Breath Washout Technique ( MBNW ) MBNW utilized number clinical study , consider gold standard measurement lung volume18-21 . Currently , accurate way measure volume lung dilution know amount gas low solubility rebreathing closed system . The change concentration sequential breath allow calculation volume distribution gas . One gas utilized purpose nitrogen22 , appeal due ubiquitous presence environment . Measurement nitrogen gas concentration , however , available use gas chromatography mass spectrometry , neither clinically practical . Recently , technique validate partial pressure nitrogen calculate residual partial pressure oxygen gas , carbon dioxide gas nitrogen gas , together comprise three important gas ventilator circuit . The former two gas readily measure ventilator circuit real time , course vary widely metabolic state patient . Stenqvist develop NMBW technique calculate FRC use change exhale O2 CO2 , manipulate inspire oxygen concentration alter fraction inspire nitrogen23 . FRC calculate follow : FiN2 = 1-FiO2 ( set ventilator ) FeO2 = 1-FeO2 ( measure ) -FeCO2 ( measure ) Inspired expire alveolar tidal volume calculate use O2 consumption ( VO2 ) CO2 production ( VCO2 ) calculate indirect calorimetry24 : Volumes inspire expired nitrogen gas associate single breath calculate end-tidal nitrogen content ( EtN2 , infer measure expired CO2 oxygen content ) , inspire nitrogen fraction ( FiN2 ) inspiratory expiratory alveolar tidal volume follow : Before make incremental 10 % change FiN2 via manipulate FiO2 , baseline value VO2 , VCO2 ETN2 make . VO2 VCO2 assume constant throughout measurement . The FiN2 manipulate , FRC estimate follow : Measurement FRC use methodology lung model know oxygen consumption lung volumes23 reveal excellent precision ( mean FRC 103 5 % ) even utilize incremental change FiO2 0.9 1.0 . Precision adult patient respiratory insufficiency reveal excellent precision amongst measurement . 3 . Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) Electrical impedance tomography capitalize change impendence air-filled versus tissue-filled space characterize quantify regional distribution lung volume bedside . Significant work do past decade validate technology animals25 humans26 , 27 . The technology utilizes series 16 electrode place across patient 's chest ( Figure 6 ) . As small current pass electrode , impedance measure amongst series . Through complex interrogation manipulation impedance value , two-dimensional image form ( Figure 7 ) , show correlate clinical radiographic change patients27 . In ten mechanically ventilate adult ARDS , end-expiratory lung volume determine nitrogen washout correlate well end-expiratory lung impedance r2 0.95.26 The ability estimate lung volume non-invasively real time may significantly improve outcome patient lung injury . Specifically , ability determine patient 's ideal functional residual capacity ventilate towards goal may improve oxygen delivery maximize pulmonary compliance minimize pulmonary vascular resistance . This study seek utilize vary level PEEP alter end-expiratory volume , use EIT surrogate measure confirm efficacy , measure oxygenation shunt fraction clinical end point . Should study demonstrate ability effectively recruit lung minimize shunt fraction use aggressive PEEP strategy , study clinical benefit warrant . 4 . Exhaled Breath Condensate ( measure lung health ) There grow body evidence regard change airway line fluid ( ALF ) pH acute chronic respiratory disease characterize , least part , inflammation . It demonstrate pH ALF low ( acidic ) multiple pulmonary inflammatory disease include asthma28 , cystic fibrosis29 , pneumonia , ARDS30-32 , pH detect continuously , safely non-invasively exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) 33 . The pH EBC may safe , non-invasive screen tool progression ARDS , lung recruitment . It anecdotally show predict respiratory failure impend respiratory infection ( unpublished data ) . As see Figure 4 ( leave ) , EBC pH marker exhibit rapid turnover thus may valuable real-time monitoring lung pathology . Continuous exhale breath condensate pH collection assay system ( ALFA monitor , Respiratory Research , Inc. , Austin , Texas ) consist condenser attached expiratory limb ventilator . Exhaled breath condensate collect continuously expiratory port , condense cool chamber , CO2 remove , collect inferior chamber pH continuously read . This yield continuous , responsive measure ventilate patient , ( 1 ) take sample exhaust port outside ventilator circuit , ( 2 ) add measurable resistance ventilator circuit . The measurement EBC patient lung injury may serve early marker derecruitment . II . Study Objectives Specific Aim 1 : To demonstrate efficacy maximal recruitment strategy increase lung volume improve oxygenation child acute lung injury , utilize multiple breath nitrogen washout ( MBNW ) electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) measure lung volume . ( Hypothesis : Lung volume oxygenation increase follow maximal recruitment protocol compare 'baseline ventilation ' 'open lung approach . ' ) Specific Aim 2 : To compare lung volume measure MBNW EIT vary end-expiratory lung volume . ( Hypothesis : Lung volume measure MBNW correlate obtain EIT . )</detailed_description>
