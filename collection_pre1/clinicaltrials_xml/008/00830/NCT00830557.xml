	<brief_title>Collecting Medical Information Tissue Samples From Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Other Pancreatic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To collect clinical data family history blood and/or tissue sample patient diagnose pancreatic disease , include pancreatic cancer , use future study . - To collect information regard food preparation intake patient . Secondary - To make available researcher medical data biospecimens enable develop good way screen people risk pancreatic condition , include pancreatic cancer . - To investigate gene substance increase susceptibility develop pancreatic condition . - To find agent may help prevent , treat , cure condition . - To learn whether inherited factor increase risk pancreatic disease , pancreatic cancer , cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients complete two 1-hour survey assess health , clinical family history pancreatic condition include cancer , food preparation intake . Patients also complete 15- 30-minute follow survey 6 month 1 year ass health , health practice , family history . A review patient 's medical information obtain medical record . Blood sample collect future research study . Oral cell stool sample may also collect future study .</detailed_description>
