	<detailed_description>Background : Obesity , global epidemic , lead cause illness mortality develop world . To good understand pathophysiological mechanism underlie weight disorder , increase attention pay central regulatory element energy homeostasis , include food intake energy expenditure . The human hormone ghrelin secrete preprohormone ( preproghrelin ) , two hormone antagonistic effect derive : ghrelin , orexigenic effect obestatin , anorexigenic effect . Ghrelin 's action mediate GH secretagogue receptor ( GHSR ) . Ghrelin synthesis occur predominantly epithelial cell fundus stomach . . As ligand GHSR , ghrelin stimulates secretion GH . In rodent human , ghrelin regulates hunger though action hypothalamic feeding center . Other effect ghrelin include stimulate gastric emptying , positive effect cardiovascular function , increase intestinal peristalsis , positive exocrine paracrine pancreatic secretion . Despite important physiological role , precise regulatory mechanism remain ambiguous . Thus , suggest mutation ghrelin receptor present clinically obesity , eat disorder growth disturbance . To date , four different mutation report GHSR mutation find ghrelin gene . Working hypothesis aim : We hypothesize mutation ghrelin receptor , GHSR , affect appetite regulation cause growth eat disorder . Methods : A total 250 child follow pediatric endocrine department Ha'Emek Medical Center divide four group : 50 child GH deficiency , 50 obese child , 50 child failure thrive ( FTT ) , 50 child idiopathic short stature ( ISS ) . In addition , 50 child without growth weight disorder include control group . Genomic DNA isolate peripheral blood standard method . The corresponding intron-exon boundary ghrelin GHSR gene analyze direct sequence use ABI Prism 3100 DNA Analyzer . Expected result : We anticipate mutation ghrelin receptor affect growth appetite regulation . Importance : The finding study expand understand ghrelin 's role growth appetite regulation . Probable implication medicine : The development specific therapeutic modality treatment short stature obesity child may become possible .</detailed_description>
