	<brief_title>A Study Of Selective Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor P1446A-05 In Subjects With Advanced Refractory Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I open label study evaluate safety efficacy P1446A-05 subject advance refractory malignancy . Subjects solid tumor hematologic malignancy include per selection criterion . Starting dose P1446A-05 study 75 mg orally daily 14 day follow 7 day rest . This constitute one cycle P1446A-05.Three patient enrol first cohort start dose P1446A-05 . If dose well tolerate dose escalation undertaken subsequent cohort per accelerate titration design describe protocol till maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) P1446A-05 determine . The MTD recommend phase 2 dose . 10 additional patient might enrol MTD evaluate safety efficacy . It expect around 50 subject would enrol study.Safety assessment conduct basis vital sign , physical examination laboratory investigation undertake regular interval per schedule .</detailed_description>
