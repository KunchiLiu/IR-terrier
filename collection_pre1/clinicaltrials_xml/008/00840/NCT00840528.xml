	<detailed_description>Sputum assessment day : Subjects meet require health status follow medical screen provide verbal write description experimental procedure possible risk involve participation . All subject require provide write informed consent participate study . The ability subject produce adequate induce sputum sample also determine . Therefore subject ask produce sputum follow inhalation hypertonic saline ( 3 , 4 5 % ) . Subjects able produce least 50 mg sputum ( select plug ) per sample . Each sputum sample must contain total cell count least 100,000 cell , differential cell count contain less 40 % squamous epithelial cell , cell viability least 50 % , thus minimize variability cell recovery squamous cell contamination . Subjects effective sputum producer schedule training session . Subjects may still exclude study unable perform adequate pulmonary function test . Training session : Training session occur less 2 day prior exposure - Lung function test , include spirometry plethysmography ( body box measurement ) . - Introduction ozone exposure chamber . - Instruction use treadmill , include minute ventilation measurement reach level exercise require study . - Nitric oxide measurement - measure amount nitric oxide ( NO ) present expire air . An increased concentration NO exhale air may find normal person acute inflammation upper respiratory tract infection association symptom patient allergic rhinitis . Thus , measurement concentration NO expire air may useful indirect assessment airway inflammation . Lung production NO measure collection sample exhale gas . Nasal production NO measure directly connect NO analyzer sample line one nostril nostril open ambient air . During nasal measurement subject exhale cardboard , disposable tube resistance order close palate prevent contamination nasal sample . The entire procedure complete less 15 minute . Exposure test protocol : Upon arrival laboratory , subject ' clinical health status ascertain medical personnel , include base line heart rate , blood pressure , evaluation respiratory symptom ( breath sound ) general health . All female subject require provide menstrual cycle history urine sample required pregnancy test . Each pregnancy test consider valid 7 day . Testing postpone subject exceed previously establish limit . The 0.4 ppm ozone exposure conduct ozone exposure chamber . Each subject expose ozone 2 hour . During exposure , subject perform four 15 minute bout moderate exercise ( minute ventilation VE = 30 40 L/min ) treadmill , separate 15 minute seat rest . Before exposure , lung function breath sound assessed sign bronchial constriction . Venipuncture ( note ) occur prior exposure . Measurements cardiorespiratory performance obtain exercise period . Approximately 4-6 hour follow ozone exposure , venipuncture occur . Subjects perform sputum induction procedure describe nebulized inhaled hypertonic saline ( 3 , 4 5 % ) . The subject remain medical supervision pulmonary function ( spirometry ) return within 5 % pre-exposure baseline value leave laboratory . Approximately 24 hour ozone exposure , subject return laboratory lung function test sputum induction , addition venous blood sample . At time point ( pre post exposure , 24 hour post exposure ) , blood drawn vein forearm clinical lab tube . During one blood draw additional 5ml drawn genotyping . Plasma separate 4 ml frozen 70 degree C future analysis mediator interest , cytokine , well systemic effect ozone . The remain blood assessed whole blood assay marker inflammatory immune activation ( CD11b , CD14 , CD64 , CD16 , HLA-DR , CD45 , CD3 , CD80 , CD86 ) function ( phagocytosis oxidative burst ) two colour flow cytometry . RNA extract sputum inflammatory cell microarray analysis , . During course participation subject require abstain ; ingestion Vitamins C E , aspirin anti-inflammatory medication , exposure cigarette smoke irritant . In addition , subject ask nothing mouth 2 hour sputum induction . They ask arrive research lab NPO x 2 hour train day post exposure day , lunch exposure day time allow 2 hour NPO requirement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects FEV1/FVC equal great 75 % , well FVC FEV1 great equal 80 % predict normal height age . Skin test perform ; subject active allergy study symptomatic . Subjects must good general health history acute chronic cardiovascular disease , chronic respiratory disease , acute respiratory illness within 4 week , without contraindication perform sustained light moderate exercise . Subjects must demonstrate ability produce acceptable induced sputum sample training session . If sample unsatisfactory , subject 's participation end point . Antidepressants medication may permit opinion investigator medication interfere study procedure compromise safety ; dosage stable 3 month . Subjects must smoke less 10 cigarette ( one half pack ) month least 3 year . Individuals smoke great 10 pack year lifetime exclude . Subjects must willing refrain strenuous physical activity 24 hour exposure . asthmatic active allergic rhinitis Non English speak volunteer exclude one study staff fluent languages likely encounter . use antiinflammatory medication medication asthma</criteria>
