	<brief_title>Orally Fludarabine , Adriamycin Dexamethasone ( FAD ) Newly Diagnosed Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas ( PTCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Doxorubicin often use treat Peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) . However , patient PTCL especially poor outcome 5-year overall survival rate 26 % follow treatment standard doxorubicin contain regimen . There general agreement result conventional chemotherapy poor patient PTCL new approach warranted.The nucleoside analog Fludarabine combine agent PTCL ( exclude ALK positive ALCL primary cutaneous ALCL ) report others.We conduct II stage clinical trial evaluate efficacy Orally Fludarabine , Adriamycin Dexamethasone ( FAD ) first line therapy patient Newly Diagnosed PTCL .</detailed_description>
