	<brief_summary>There grow evidence COPD multi-organ system disease . Besides impaired lung function , skeletal muscle weakness weight loss important determinant impaired exercise performance , decrease quality life increase mortality . Based earlier succesful intervention study pulmonary rehabilitation setting , MÃ¡xima Medical Centre develop integrate , inter-disciplinary approach management COPD include physical exercise , nutritional therapy , education , smoke cessation psychological consultation . This COPD management program consist set protocol cover patient recruitment , diagnostic testing , treatment , follow-up communication professional . The exercise program nutitional therapy carry local physiotherapist dietician work outside conjunction hospital . A program setting could substantially less expensive certainly easily accessible many patient inpatient hospital-based outpatient rehabilitation program , offer close patient 's home . This study investigate ( cost- ) effectiveness COPD management program compare usual care randomize control trial . Patients moderate severe COPD reduce exercise capacity incremental exercise test le 70 % predict , randomised treatment control group . The treatment group participate COPD management program first 4 month follow remaining month . Both group ( n=100 ) follow 2 year outcomes assess begin program , 4 , 12 24 month disease-specific generic measure health status , body composition , skeletal muscle function exercise capacity . A cost-effectiveness cost-utility analysis two-year time horizon perform . The analysis conduct societal perspectice , include program cost COPD-related direct cost within outside healthcare sector ans cost lose productivity .</brief_summary>
