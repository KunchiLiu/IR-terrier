	<brief_summary>Purpose : People genetic defect ability burn fat also develop problem nerve foot . The nerve problem , neuropathy , limit ability walk . Part treatment genetic defect ability burn fat eat low fat diet . Vitamin E find fatty food like oil nut . People genetic defect ability burn fat may low vitamin E low fat diet . The purpose study test whether vitamin E supplement improve nerve function foot people genetic defect ability burn fat . Procedures : Blood sample draw begin study , 2 month 6 month vitamin E supplement . The blood analyze plasma vitamin E concentration . Around time blood draw subject record food beverage consume three day . The subject send record investigator . Subjects physical exam doctor specialize nerve , neurologist take vitamin E. They nerve function measure test call nerve conduction velocity NCV . Subjects give 800 international unit ( IU ) vitamin E per day 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>People long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase ( LCHAD ) mitochondrial trifunctional protein ( TFP ) deficiency , inherited disorder fatty acid ÃŸ-oxidation , lack ability fully oxidize fatty acid energy . Progressive peripheral neuropathy chronic complication disorder lead loss ability walk 1/3 subject . Current therapy people disorder base frequent meal consume low fat , high carbohydrate diet . Severe restriction dietary fat may lead iatrogenic fat-soluble vitamin deficiency . Vitamin E fat-soluble vitamin find cooking oil , salad dressing , nut . Deficiency vitamin E result peripheral neuropathy similar describe subject LCHAD TFP deficiency . Hypothesis : Subjects LCHAD TFP deficiency vitamin E deficient due follow low fat diet . Vitamin E deficiency exacerbate peripheral neuropathy observe disease . High dose vitamin E supplementation replete vitamin E deficiency improve neurological function subject LCHAD TFP deficiency . Aim : Measure vitamin E concentration neurological function baseline 10 subject LCHAD TFP deficiency . Following baseline measure , subject supplement high dose vitamin E ( 400 IU capsule 2 time per day ) 6 month . Vitamin E concentration neurological function study repeat end 6 month . Data vitamin E supplementation compare student T-test . Vitamin E function antioxidant use multiple large supplementation trial . The upper limit intake recommend safe Institute Medicine ( IOM ) 600 mg approximately 900 IU vitamin E child 9-13 year age . We previously report dietary intake vitamin extremely low child LCHAD TFP deficiency supplement ( 5 ) . An iatrogenic vitamin E deficiency may exacerbate and/or accelerate neuropathic symptom subject LCHAD TFP deficiency . This open-label trial test hypothesis high dose vitamin E improve neurological function subject LCHAD TFP deficiency progressive peripheral neuropathy . Research Design Methods : Overall study design : This open-label supplementation trial vitamin E subject LCHAD TFP deficiency . Subjects diagnose LCHAD TFP document peripheral neuropathy recruit participate . A fasting baseline blood sample analyze plasma vitamin E concentration . A neurological exam nerve conduction study ( NCV ) perform neurologist baseline measure neuropathy . Subjects begin high dose vitamin E supplementation 6 month . 400 IU ( 268 mg ) capsule provided subject . Subjects instruct take one capsule meal 2 time per day . The supplement absorb good consume fat food . At end 2 month supplementation , another blood sample collect analyzed plasma vitamin E concentration . At end 6 month , 3rd blood sample collect neurological study repeat . Differences function NCV baseline correlate plasma vitamin E concentration . During 6 month subject complete 2 3-day diet record estimate vitamin E consumption food . Blood Measures : Subjects arrive clinic lab blood sample overnight fast minimum 8 hour 12 hour . Greater 12 hour fast recommended subject fatty acid oxidation disorder . Six milliliter venous whole blood collect . Plasma separate frozen analysis . Samples give unique code laboratory principal investigator ship Dr. Traber 's laboratory Corvallis , Oregon . Dr. Traber , Oregon State University , measure plasma vitamin E vitamin E metabolites . The principal investigator maintain code link data patient information . Results Dr. Traber 's lab report back principal investigator data analysis . Neurological Studies : A standard neurological examination carry emphasis sensory exam , muscle weakness exam deep tendon reflex exam . An electromyogram ( EMG ) nerve conduction study also carry . For EMG , needle electrode insert skin muscle . The electrical activity detect electrode display oscilloscope , may hear speaker . The observation wave form physician determine whether electrical activity muscle normal whether pathological change denervation present . Nerve conduction velocity ( NCV ) test speed signal nerve . Patches call surface electrode , similar use ECG , place skin nerve various location . Each patch give mild electrical impulse , stimulate nerve . The nerve 's resulting electrical activity record electrode . The distance electrodes time take electrical impulse travel electrode use determine speed nerve signal . Further , amplitude electrical discharge measure time impulse take cross muscle-nerve junction determine . The electrical testing involve motor sensory nerve . Statistical Analysis : Difference plasma vitamin E concentration neurological study baseline 6 month compare student 's T-test . Correlation neurological outcome plasma vitamin E concentration evaluate linear regression .</detailed_description>
