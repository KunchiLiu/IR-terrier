	<brief_summary>The aim project determine whether daylight activate photodynamic therapy effective treat cutaneous leishmaniasis cause L. major L. tropical . PDT classically perform two-step procedure MAL application lesion constitute first step , PpIX activation light appropriate wavelength artificial light source constitute second step . Based knowledge red blue light require activate PpIX part daylight spectrum , investigator postulate effective PpIX activation obtain exposure MAL treat lesion daylight thus substantially simplify PDT procedure omit 3 hour incubation period subsequent exposure artificial light . In accord , recent study investigator show daylight-activated PDT ( DA-PDT ) effective conventional MAL-PDT treat precancerous actinic keratoses lesion . Furthermore investigator find DA-PDT significantly less painful conventional MAL-PDT . The investigator propose study efficacy DA-PDT treatment cutaneous leishmaniasis . DA-PDT obvious advantage conventional leishmania treatment form : As oppose available treatment option , DA-PDT self-administered procedure require assistance medical personnel . Secondly , judge experience MAL-PDT , treatment session require effective parasite kill oppose prolonged procedure usually require treatment leishmaniasis . Third , PDT far best safety profile available treatment option .</brief_summary>
