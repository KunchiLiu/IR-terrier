	<brief_summary>Lenalidomide show significant efficacy treatment anemia associate 5q- non 5q- MDS patient . The mechanism ( ) action lenalidomide MDS still determine , give difference response rate see , probable mechanism different patient 5q- disease compare non 5q- patient . T-cell mediate activation intramedullary apoptosis patient early MDS lead impaired hematopoiesis well describe . Immunomodulation agent ATG , cyclosporine thalidomide demonstrate clear activity patient MDS . Lenalidomide , among many effect , potent immunomodulator , may contribute ability improve red blood cell count patient MDS . It possible effect could augment addition cyclosporine A ( CSA ) , similar manner CSA effect patient bone marrow failure syndromes aplastic anemia . Subjects treat lenalidomide 10 mg PO daily day 1-28 28-day cycle . Cyclosporine A started day 1 cycle 2 ( day 29 ) dose 5 mg/kg per day give orally 2 divided dos . Cyclosporine A level assess weekly dos adjust maintain serum trough level 100-450 mg/ml . Patients continue therapy minimum 16 week unless toxicity occur precludes continuation therapy , disease progression and/or patient withdrawal consent . Patients achieve response complete 16 week therapy discontinue treatment . Patients achieve response continue therapy disease progression , unacceptable toxicity loss response .</brief_summary>
