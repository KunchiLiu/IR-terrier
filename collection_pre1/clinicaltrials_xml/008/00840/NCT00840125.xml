	<brief_summary>Study Rationale : There increase evidence erlotinib improve overall survival select patient stage IIIB-IV NSCLC . Furthermore , pre-clinical phase II study show potential synergism erlotinib docetaxel . This study evaluate effect combination treatment overall survival select NSCLC patient population . Based recent publish data , treatment cycle study 22 day two infusion ( Day 1 Day 8 cycle ) . This different standard therapy care 28-day cycle ( three infusion Days 1 , 8 15 ) . The short 22-day cycle show effective 28-day cycle expect increase subject compliance decrease chemotherapy-induced toxicity . Study Objectives : The primary objective demonstrate superiority progression-free-survival , erlotinib add docetaxel . The secondary objective determine : - Overall survival ( defined time period start first-line therapy death ) - Time treatment failure disease progression ( defined time period start first-line therapy investigator assess disease progression ) - Tumor response rate duration - Safety profile - Quality Life improvement - microRNA profile ( assessed human lung biopsy and/or cytology sample ) screen prognostic purpose</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase II , open-label , single-center , repeat dose , study . After two-week screening phase , eligible subject receive combine docetaxel erlotinib treatment six cycle . Each 22-day treatment cycle consist two infusion docetaxel , one-week apart follow one week rest , daily administration erlotinib . Subjects , complete six cycle combination therapy , continue receive erlotinib monotherapy long benefit therapy opinion investigator ( i.e . continue toxicity disease progression withdrawal study ) . Subjects evaluate safety radiologic tumor assessment throughout study death . The study terminate every living patient follow least 6 month stop TarcevaTM , patient die .</detailed_description>
