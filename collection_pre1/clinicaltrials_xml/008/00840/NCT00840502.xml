Accurate assessment fetal growth gestational age timely identification management growth restriction therefore public health priority , especially develop country 98 % neonatal death occur . Every year , 50 million woman become pregnant malaria endemic region . Malaria infection time pregnancy reduces birthweight . However , little know relationship time infection pregnancy extent impact birth weight . The mechanism malaria cause LBW also remain unclear . Reduced placental blood flow , placental change , red blood cell change , severe anaemia pro-inflammatory cytokine implicate . In propose , longitudinal , observational , minimal risk study , take place SMRU antenatal clinic Thai-Burmese border , effect malaria infection pregnancy fetal growth determine . Women screen 13+6 week gestation follow regular ultrasound examination pregnancy . When woman malaria infection extra ultrasound scan do measure growth retardation placental blood flow change . Bloodsamples take detect change red blood cell property putative marker malaria infection . For study maximum amount blood take pregnancy 13 cc uninfected woman . For malaria episode additional 7 cc blood take . After delivery placenta cord sample take detect placental change . The investigator aim recruit four hundred pregnant woman course two year .
