	<brief_summary>The purpose study test usefulness image radiolabeled methionine evaluation child young adult tumor ( ) . Methionine naturally occur essential amino acid . It crucial formation protein . When label carbon-11 ( C-11 ) , radioactive isotope naturally occur carbon-12 , distribution methionine determine noninvasively use PET ( positron emission tomography ) camera . C-11 methionine ( MET ) show valuable monitoring large number neoplasm . Since C-11 short half life ( 20 minute ) , MET must produce facility close intend use . Thus , widely available produce select institution access cyclotron PET chemistry facility . With new availability short live tracer produce PET chemistry unit , St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( St. Jude ) one facility capabilities interest evaluate utility PET scan detection tumor , evaluation response therapy , distinction residual tumor scar tissue patient complete therapy . The investigator propose examine biodistribution MET patient malignant solid neoplasm , emphasis central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor sarcomas . This project introduce new diagnostic test noninvasive evaluation neoplasm pediatric oncology . Although primary purpose proposal , investigator anticipate MET study provide useful clinical information management patient malignant neoplasm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study focus follow objective : Primary objective : - To estimate success rate Methionine ( MET ) visualize tumor time diagnosis . The study hypothesize least 70 % newly diagnose tumor within group study successfully visualize . Secondary objective : - To compare uptake MET tumor tumor grade patient newly diagnose relapse , and/or persistent disease . Hypothesis : high grade tumor concentrate high amount MET low grade tumor measure qualitatively semi-quantitatively . - To examine bio-distribution MET organs contain tumor , particular lung , heart , mediastinum , liver , spleen , pancreas , muscle , brain , bone marrow . Exploratory objective : - To compare finding MET PET scan standard image modality , principally MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) FDG ( fluorodeoxyglucose ) PET CT ( compute tomography ) diagnosis , study enrollment patient relapse persistent disease , patient time . - To compare extent abnormality MRI MET . - To determine presence absence elevate MET uptake beyond MRI define abnormality . - To explore relationship MET uptake prognosis .</detailed_description>
