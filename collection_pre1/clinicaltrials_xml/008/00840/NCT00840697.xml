	<brief_title>Effect Interventions Return Work Patients With Neck Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Norway high sickness absence Scandinavian country , cost 40 milliard kr year . In addition 500 000 receive rehabilitation disability pension comprise cost 75 milliard kr . Musculoskeletal pain common cause sickness absence among 3 common cause disability pension Norway [ 1 ] . For young subject ( &lt; 40 year ) musculoskeletal disorder also represent common cause disability pension [ 2 ] . Neck low back pain comprise majority patient musculoskeletal disorder . Hence , several action initiate order reduce sickness absence improve participation work life . The agreement `` include work life '' ( `` IA avtalen '' ) introduce 2001 , represent joint effort government , employer ' organization labor organization . The superior aim prevent sickness absence promote inclusion work life despite sickness disability . However , soon become clear contradiction goal reduce sickness absence include subject diseases disability . In addition become clear knowledge factor facilitate participation work life scarce . Groups low education level , foreign origin , woman subject chronic disease dominate sickness absence statistic reach [ 3 ] , effective strategy improve also group employment seek . Hence , committee lead prime minister grant 600 mill kr order reduce sickness absence 2.5 % . The committee recognize need reinforce collaboration employer employ . However , main focus need coordinate effort health care system social security employment service . The latter two fuse one organisation Norway term `` NAV '' ( Nye arbeids og velferds etaten ) . Necessary health service need provide immediately close collaboration social security employment service well employer . Most patient neck low back pain benign self-limited condition , nevertheless experience pain full disabling [ 4 ; 5 ] . According European guideline , exercise cognitive intervention good effect pain function patient low back pain [ 6 ] ( www.backpaineurope.org ) . Multimodal treatment include exercise also show effective patient neck pain [ 7 ] . However , treatment modality seem sufficiently effective order improve return work [ 8 ] . Neck low back pain multifactorial problem , due worker ' medical characteristic , also closely related environmental factor , workplace individual factor . Physical factor like heavy lifting , vibration posture demand may importance low back pain [ 9 ; 10 ] . The work life today demand increasingly use computer risk factor neck , shoulder arm disorder . Particularly , work station poorly design duration computer use 4 hour day risk pain development [ 10 ] . Even important psychosocial environment work . Factors control work situation , demand support colleague leader importance [ 11 ] . The compensation system interaction stakeholder disability problem health care system importance return work [ 12 ; 13 ] . In addition time significant factor , reduce return work longer period sick leave [ 14 ] . Among individual factor major importance educational level [ 15 ] , course related socioeconomic class . Age , gender cultural background also well know predictor sickness absence disability pension [ 16 ] , add high prevalence musculoskeletal pain group [ 17 ] . Interventions work place coordinate early contact worker workplace , contact healthcare provider workplace also show improve return work [ 18 ] . Thus , return work dependent one single step , challenge process patient , health professional , employer employment system must interact . A particular challenge build rehabilitation-programs patient risk loose work [ 19 ] . Dr. P. Loisel , Montreal , Canada '' [ 20 ] , since 1995 treat patient low back pain accord `` The PREVICAP modell - ( PREVention work handICAP ) '' . The main purpose work-related program prevent prolong disability help patient return work . This process include identification factor workplace contribute absence work . These factor include physical , ergonomic , psychosocial , interpersonal conflict administrative problem . Subsequently `` workplace intervention '' initiate . This rehabilitation-program centered workplace , allow grade transition clinical setting workplace . Parallel workplace intervention patient enter short exercise-program , adjust workplace intervention . The Previcap model evaluate randomize controlled trial accelerate return work factor 2.4 important effect come workplace intervention , accelerate return work factor 1.9 . Patients randomized Previcap model 60 day absence work , compare 120 day control group [ 20 ; 21 ] . The Previcap-model also evaluate Amsterdam , Dr. Anema demonstrate significant difference return work rate patient randomize `` Workplace intervention '' usual treatment . This type intervention try patient neck pain , general knowledge regard neck pain poorer low back pain . Hence , Sconstein et al [ 8 ] perform Cochrane review , conclude urgent need well design randomise study try facilitate return work patient neck pain . It also important take account predictor sickness absence different factor determine return work [ 22 ] . This largely embezzled intervention strategy . Another shortcoming failure meet need employee disability [ 23 ] . That may chronic back condition cure , combine cause back pain comorbidity frequent population [ 24 ] . This particularly important employment seem important factor mental health subject disabilities [ 25 ] . Research focus interrelationship different factor lack . This type knowledge need order improve intervention strategy . It also obvious success achieve employment service stakeholder contribute . Hence , research field call joint effort health care service , employer employment service . At Ulleval University Hospital ( UUH ) St Olavs hospital health care patient neck-and back pain organise multi-professional unit , take care 4000 2000 ? patient , respectively , annual basis . Within system possible provide necessary diagnostic evaluation medical treatment . The ongoing NAV project institution provide possibility offer medical care within 2 week . Multimodal treatments include exercise also provide . At UUS , PREVICAP model implement evaluated usual treatment patient low back pain randomized trial . However , patient neck pain include . Hence , main intention evaluate PREVICAP model randomize trial include patient neck pain . In worker population psychosocial factor work include relationship demand control [ 26 ] well balance effort reward [ 27 ] show importance . Such comprehensive assessment patient report work-related factor previously perform specialized health care . These factor combine medical assessment personal factor multiple prediction model , order single combination factor importance . Although , The PREVICAP model show good result Return work , Montreal , Amsterdam , unknown model work country , due difference culture , work term compensatory system ? So , collaborate research group Toronto ( D.Cassidy , Health Network Rehabilitation Solutions , Toronto Western Hospital ) multinational study Return work-Rehabilitation patient neck back complaint . The process return work complete identified problem meet adequate action work place NAV . These action also reduce cost associated work disability duration [ 18 ; 28 ] . Few study address collaboration health care system employer employment service . Hence , extent advise adaptation work place take care well support give NAV need assess related outcome participation work life . And last , cost potential socioeconomic consequence action need assess . The main purpose study combine knowledge medical aspect neck-and back pain knowledge organizational compensatory structure , occupational- socioeconomic factor investigate factor influence cause phenomenon sick-leave . The specific aim : - ass work- , individual- health factor interrelationship predict sickness absence work disability . - investigate rehabilitation program specifically focus return work process reduce sickness absence disability pension patient neck low back pain . - compare result rehabilitation program result rehabilitation program Toronto - extent patient meet action employer employment service , influence sickness absence disability . - action represent favorable cost benefit work place society</detailed_description>
