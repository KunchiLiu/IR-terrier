	<brief_summary>The investigator plan obtain skin blood sample healthy volunteer patient benign , inherited hematologic disease use research use homologous recombination correct β-globin gene mutation therapeutically useful cell , like autologous induced pluripotent stem cell sickle cell anemia patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skin Blood Research Samples From Healthy Volunteers Patients With Hematologic Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To obtain skin biopsy sample normal healthy volunteer patient benign , inherited hematologic disease , sickle cell anemia , create induce pluripotent stem cell . Pluripotency confirm inject potential iPS cell line immunodeficient mouse , assess ability line cause cystic teratoma recipient mouse . - To define efficiency homologous recombination induce pluripotent stem cell derive skin biopsy sample . - To define efficiency homologous recombination human embryonic stem cell use NIH-approved cell line . - To establish genetic consequence derivation human induce pluripotent cell normal control patient benign , inherited , hematologic disease , genomic analysis , include whole genome sequencing . - To establish genetic consequence homologous recombination human induce pluripotent stem cell embryonic stem cell genomic analysis , include whole genome sequencing . - To obtain blood sample confirm genetic mutation patient inherited hematologic disease ( confirm mutation healthy volunteer ) .</detailed_description>
