	<brief_summary>The purpose study see brief delay cord clamp 30 45 second would result high hematocrit level , few transfusion , healthy lung , good motor function 40 wks 7 month age .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Delayed Cord Clamping Very Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When cord clamp delay birth cord milk , infant receive placental transfusion 10-15 mL/kg first minute life . This additional blood improves hemodynamic stability may reduce risk intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) vulnerability infant inflammatory process . This blood also contain stem cell important repair tissue building immunocompetence . The current randomized control trial prospectively test effect DCC 30-45 second follow 1 cord milk aim confirm prior work provide long-term follow-up . Our priori hypothesis DCC would reduce incidence IVH , LOS , result well motor function 18-22 month .</detailed_description>
