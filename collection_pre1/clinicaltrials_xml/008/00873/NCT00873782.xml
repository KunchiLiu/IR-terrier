	<brief_summary>Muscular dystrophy inherit disorder skeletal heart muscle become progressively weak , sometimes leading permanent disability . Current treatment aim control symptom much possible , cure . Gene therapy , defective gene cause disorder correct , potential treatment option process develop muscular dystrophy . This study determine safety feasibility particular delivery method gene therapy could use future treat people muscular dystrophy . Only normal saline , active treatment , use study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Transvenous Limb Perfusion Human Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There many type muscular dystrophy , progressive , degenerative genetic disorder . One type Becker 's muscular dystrophy , involve slowly worsening muscle weakness legs pelvis lead cardiomyopathy , deformity , respiratory failure , permanent disability . Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy , another type , also characterize progressive muscle weakness , first affect muscle around shoulder girdle hips possibly affect muscle disorder progress . Complications limb-girdle muscular dystrophy include abnormal heart rhythm , joint contracture , difficulty activity daily live , significant loss mobility , permanent disability . There cure muscular dystrophy . Current treatment , steroid , mobility aid , physical therapy , respiratory care , decrease complication , clear need curative therapy . The genetic basis muscular dystrophy well understood , make gene therapy potential treatment option future . A key step develop gene therapy involve first ensure safe delivery genetic material single limb patient use active treatment patient 's entire body . High-pressure , high-volume transvenous limb perfusion , fluid force high pressure arm leg muscle vein , show great potential delivery method . The purpose study determine safety feasibility method normal saline people Becker 's muscular dystrophy limb-girdle muscular dystrophy . Participation study last 4 week . At initial baseline visit , participant undergo water emersion measurement arm leg , nerve testing , muscle strength test . About 1 2 week later , participant enter pediatric intensive care unit 36 hour . During inpatient stay , participant undergo high-pressure , high-volume transvenous limb perfusion procedure normal saline one arm leg . Throughout hospital stay , breathing , heart rate , blood pressure monitor . Medication available control discomfort pain experience participant . Each subsequent participant receive fluid pump high pressure tight tourniquet previous participant , long problem adverse effect detect . Some participant undergo MRI immediately perfusion procedure . About 1 2 week inpatient stay , participant attend follow-up visit include repeat nerve muscle strength testing , blood draw , photo limbs , ultrasound leg blood vessel participant 's leg use perfusion procedure .</detailed_description>
