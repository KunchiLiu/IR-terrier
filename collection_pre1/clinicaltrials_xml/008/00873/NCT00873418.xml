	<detailed_description>Over 5 million Americans suffer heart failure ( HF ) , associate annual health care cost excess $ 33 billion . With 500,000 new case develop year , HF major cardiovascular disease increase prevalence . Despite intensive medical therapy , symptom instability clinical deterioration common lead frequent physician visit , hospitalization , ultimately death . HF symptom , include dyspnea fatigue , major source distress patient HF , often impose severe limitation daily activity . Depression also common HF patient , presence associate increase risk hospitalization mortality , independent disease severity . There grow evidence behavioral management critical component live HF reduce hospitalization help optimize health status . Although previous study demonstrate case-management program effective , benefit appear short-lived ongoing care reduce . Prior research laboratory others show cop skill train ( CST ) , design teach patient self-management skill cope effectively psychological distress associate medical condition , effective chronic disease diabetes , ischemic heart disease , lung disease . However , CST yet evaluate intervention facilitate self-management HF . We propose randomized clinical trial compare 16-week CST intervention Extended ( Standardized ) Care study sample 200 HF outpatient , receive medical treatment HF accord current clinical practice guideline . The CST intervention , deliver telephone , design reduce stress depression improve aspect health behavior relate HF outcome , include symptom monitoring , medication adherence , dietary compliance , physical activity . Before follow treatment , patient carefully assess important intermediate medical endpoint include HF disease biomarkers ( B-type natriuretic peptide , ejection fraction , vascular endothelial function , autonomic regulation , inflammatory activity ) , well quality life ( QoL ) indicate physical psychosocial functioning . Effects CST clinical outcome evaluate accord all-cause hospitalization mortality median follow-up period 3 year . The data generate propose study provide important insight regard value CST usual medical care . If successful , believe study finding translate initial recommendation incorporation CST self-management behavioral intervention cost-effective approach enhance disease management , QoL longevity HF patient .</detailed_description>
