	<brief_summary>The investigator main hypothesis stone free rate much high ( 95 % ) patient treat PCNL patient treat ESWL stone free rate ( 60 % ) determine treatment safe prevent less stone recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Versus Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy prefer small stone less 10 mm size . Percutaneous nephrolithotomy standard therapy use large kidney stone great 20 millimeter stone low kidney . For moderate size kidney stone ( 10-20 mm ) , currently option treatment include method . However , study prove one procedure well . So , compare procedure break kidney stone . Our main outcome measure stone-free status procedure . Other outcome measure assessment morbidity associate use procedure i.e . minor major complication within 3 month initial treatment . Patient assess infection post-operative office visit include basic urinalysis systemic indicator infection ( fever , dysuria , frequency , etc. ) . Pain monitor scale 0-10 point . Also review stone density Computerized Tomography ( CT ) scan effect success procedure . We hope PCNL stone-free rate minimum minimal morbidity ultimately improve patient care .</detailed_description>
