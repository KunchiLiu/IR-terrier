	<brief_title>JAK-STAT Signalling Pathway Familial Myeloproliferative Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myeloproliferative disorder ( MPD ) rare malignant disease bone marrow characterize proliferation differentiate blood cell long time possible transformation acute leukaemia . The recent identification recurrent activate tyrosine kinase mutation V617F JAK2 gene provide breakthrough understand molecular mechanism disease . It ca n't explain nevertheless phenotypic diversity MPD occurrence familial aggregation . The investigator show actually mutation V617F somatic one variably express among patient family.Other somatic mutation inherit factor , still unknown , may explain discrepancy . JAK-STAT pathway essential role non-CML MPD show functional consequence V617F JAK2 mutation . Therefore , investigator focus study gene encode factor implicate signal pathway . Two genetic approach use : 1-study know polymorphism ( SNP ) theses gene involve JAK-STAT pathway ; 2-search rare mutation locate specific region ( bind domainâ€¦ ) candidate genes.The study national multicenter research base national network ( 55 center ) investigator organize help French Society Of Hematology 1998 . The investigator propose include 120 family define presence least 2 case non CML MPD ( WHO PVSG criterion ) .The investigator already collect 60 family ( affected case control subject ) ; 60 include next two year . In family , two patient MPD one control include ( subject 18 year old ) . Peripheral blood sample ( 35ml ) buccal swab collect subject . Hematologists ONCOGENETICIANS include family , collect clinical biological data perform collection biological material subject include study accord approve rules.All data anonymously register Access data base . Hematological study do Immuno-Hematological Laboratory Saint ANTOINE . Genetic study conduct Genetic Department Saint ANTOINE Hospital transfer Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital Paris . The genetic study base analysis 120 unrelated familial SMP case ( randomise ) 120 control . The investigator study 10 gene involve JAK-STAT pathway ( cytokine receptor , Janus kinases , regulatory factor ) .The genotyping SNPs , select HAPMAP CGEMS databases perform quantitative PCR . The investigator plan analyze 50 SNPs per subject i.e . 24000 genotype ( duplicate point ) . The analysis base allelic frequency comparison two group use bilateral paired t-test ; 120 pair subject ( case control ) allow detect 0.6 deviation standard allelic frequency case control ( alpha = 5 % , beta = 10 % ) . The search rare mutation do genomic sequencing particular region candidate gene 120 affected case .</detailed_description>
