	<detailed_description>Autism severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterize impaired social interaction communication , markedly restrict repertoire activity interest . The population prevalence autism approximately 1 1000 ( GILLBERG WING , 1999 ) ratio affect male female 4:1 ( FOMBONNE , 1999 ) . Although typically consider childhood disorder , person autism experience mark functional impairment throughout life . Follow-up study child autism show 5 % -10 % become independent adult , 25 % progress still require supervision , remain continue severely impair need institutionalize care ( WING , 1989 ) . Thus , syndrome represent substantial public health problem tragic cost individual , family , community . It randomize , double blind flexible dose study parallel group , control , fluoxetine versus placebo . The final efficacy evaluation do 6 month treatment ; Nine obligatory visit plan Patients assess follow visit : base-line inclusion ( D-15 ) , 2 , 4 , ,12 , ,20 , 22 , 24 25 , 26 week . At 24 W visit , final efficacy perform medication taper maximum period 2 week . The final safety assessment perform 26W . BRAIN IMAGING PROTOCOL : We assess rest state regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) autistic child use labeled water PET , still reliable least invasive method . In addition , anatomical functional MRI perform child , day . Brain image study perform Service HOSPITALIER Frederic JOLIOT ( ORSAY , France ) Dr Monica ZILBOVICIUS responsibility . Each brain image examination perform twice : 1 ) time zero ( T0 ) - begin treatment 2 ) six month later , placebo sertraline treatment . Functional image rest state - Positron emission tomography : Regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) measure Siemens ECAT HR+ camera . Attenuation-corrected data reconstruct 63 slice , result resolution 4.5 mm full-width-at-half-maximum . Fifteen second scan , 7 mCi H215O administrate bolus injection . Data collect 80 s. All rCBF examination perform rest sleep induce premedication ( 4 mg/kg pentobarbital ) . We previously report premedication effect absolute rCBF value regional distribution . Anatomical MRI : A high resolution MRI brain obtain child witg 1.5 Tesla Signa General Electric scanner use 3D T1-weighted FSPGR sequence ( TR/TE/TI/NEX : 10.5/2.2/600/1 , flip angle 10Â° , matrix size 256 x 192 , yield 124 axial slice thickness 1.2 mm , field view 22 cm ) . The acquisition duration 6 minute . In addition , FLAIR T2 axial coronal sequence also acquire . Biological measure : Blood sample procedure whole blood serotonin : patient must follow diet poor tryptophan two day blood sample . Blood sample perform without premedication nine 11 AM . Blood withdrawn tube contain EDTA acid aprotinin . Platelet- poor plasma ( contain 0.1 % original platelet count assess contrast phase microscopy ) obtain within 2 hour centrifugation ( 2000g , 4C , 15 mn ) freeze 0.5mL aliquot -80C ass ( blind procedure use ) . The whole blood content measure radio-enzymology .</detailed_description>
