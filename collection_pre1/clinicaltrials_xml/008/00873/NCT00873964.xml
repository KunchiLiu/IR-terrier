	<brief_summary>In United States cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) account 1 every 2.8 death lead cause death among men woman 65 year old ( 1 ) . Studies show risk cardiovascular disease high individual Metabolic Syndrome ( 2 ) . Metabolic Syndrome ( MBS ) define Adult Treatment Panel III ( ATP III ) guideline group risk factor include 3 following : abdominal obesity , hypertriglyceridemia , low high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , high blood pressure , high fasting glucose ( 3 ) . These factor place individual increase risk development cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) diabetes mellitus ( 3 ) . It commonly hold insulin resistance drive force development MBS . Although significant increase incidence MBS elderly , study specifically examine MBS population . The prevailing opinion strikingly high prevalence MBS elderly due concurrent obesity - i.e. , population gain weight age , development MBS accompanies weight gain . However , true become obese may decrease insulin sensitivity , also demonstrate obese individual insulin resistant . Some study suggest 40 % obese individual demonstrate normal insulin sensitivity ( 4 ) . In addition , notable rate increase MBS population exceed rate increase BMI , suggest , BMI may modulate factor , another factor independent obesity also contribute development MBS elderly . It investigators hypothesize MBS obese elderly population primarily link insulin resistance obesity per se . The investigator propose test hypothesis assess MBS insulin resistance population obese elderly men woman determine whether MBS track insulin resistance .</brief_summary>
