	<brief_summary>Perifosine inhibit AKT pathway ( way cell communicate ) . This pathway felt important development several type cancer include chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) . It think perifosine may able block pathway lead improvement CLL SLL . The purpose trial see perifosine effective treatment relapse refractory CLL SLL . Another purpose study look effect perifosine cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perifosine Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma represent different manifestation disease . CLL/SLL ( hereafter denote CLL ) clonal disorder small B lymphocytes express characteristic morphology immunophenotype . The B cell express CD19 , dim CD 20 , dim CD 5 , CD 23 , CD 43 , CD 79a , weakly express surface immunoglobin . CLL present asymptomatically 25 % patient diagnose complete blood count . It also present diffuse painless lymphadenopathy , small number patient , B symptom . CLL characterize accumulation circulate B cell predominantly G0 phase cell cycle . These cell resistant apoptosis . CLL find aberrant signal several pathway include NF-kB , Akt/PI3K , JNK/STAT pathways . Akt important promoting CLL survival viability , see vitro experiment block activity result apoptosis . Thus AKT inhibitor may lead increased apoptosis may role treatment disease . Treatment option CLL range watch wait approach high dose chemotherapy stem cell support . Currently , consensus best treatment regimen , since treatment show improve survival randomize prospective clinical trial . New approach treatment , especially low toxicity rate , need . Perifosine show inhibit otherwise modify signal number different signal transduction pathway , include Akt , MAPK , JNK . These pathway involve development cancer resistance chemotherapy . Perifosine particular interest , especially due difficulty discovery drug inhibit pathway minimal toxicity . The effect perifosine CLL cell test laboratory show active agent primary CLL cell vitro .</detailed_description>
