	<brief_title>A Study Pharmacology Oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With pending threat pandemic avian influenza , disproportionate morbidity mortality document previous 20th century pandemic among pregnant woman , lack data use vital antiviral drug pregnancy , study pharmacology oseltamivir pregnancy imperative . If next pandemic occurs , good understand drug 's safety pharmacologic profile use pregnancy critical give fact use vulnerable patient population . This pilot study use oseltamivir pregnancy . This data combine data parallel Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit ( PPRU ) study put together portfolio use understudied population . This allow re-thinking current status potentially allow small trial perform patient suffer influenza pregnancy , assess efficacy . The relevance pandemic strain correspond Minimum Inhibitory Concentration ( MIC ) may direct implication dose pregnancy low level drug document . In addition , depend finding esterase component investigation , future investigation mechanistic base change enzyme activity possible .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) arm : Singleton gestation prior 24 0/7 week gestation Planning undergo termination procedure incident pregnancy Willingness take singledose medication follow study procedure Able undergo inform consent . For Esterase arm : Singleton gestation great 32 complete week less 40 complete week gestation Absence severe pregnancy complication could affect body volume metabolism ( i.e. , preeclampsia , renal dysfunction , hepatic dysfunction [ define serum creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min know ALT/AST &gt; 2x facility normal value ] , etc . ) Willingness follow study procedure Able undergo inform consent The use medication may affect renal metabolism contraindication participation since subject undergo PK sampling . For Oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) arm : Known current utero fetal death Significant medical history and/or medication use determine investigator potential affect result study put patient risk singledosing Known hypersensitivity component study drug Known hepatic renal dysfunction ( define serum creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min know ALT/AST &gt; 2x facility normal value ) Chronic use street drug ( obtain via subject interview and/or medical history ) Participation concurrent interventional study . We ask history depression past require treatment currently actively depress . If either question yield positive response , consider patient eligible enroll subject . For Esterase arm : Known current utero fetal death Significant medical history determine investigator potentially affect result study Chronic use street drug ( obtain via subject interview and/or medical history Participation concurrent interventional study .</criteria>
