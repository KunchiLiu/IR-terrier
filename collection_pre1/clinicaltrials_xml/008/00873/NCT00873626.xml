	<detailed_description>1 . State issue objective research The acute pyelonephritis ( AP ) represent frequent COMMUNAUTARY bacterial infection . Currently , usual recommend duration antibiotherapy disease 10 21 day . The duration treatment base scientific evidence . Shortening duration antibiotherapy would improve patient 's life quality compliance reduce side effect , duration hospitalization , cost treatment probably limit bacterial resistance . The main objective study compare rate clinical microbiological cure 30 ± 5 day end antibiotherapy uncomplicated AP young woman , accord duration antibiotic treatment : 5 day versus 10 day . 2 . People involve Patients uncomplicated AP , offer participate study consultation emergency room service health service , absence non-inclusion criterion ( immunodepression know , severe sepsis , allergy antibiotic , pregnancy , lactation ... ) . In presence abscess , obstruction urinary tract , infection stranger material device requiring , case , medical-surgical treatment , eligible study . 3 . Methods observation investigation restraint Non-inferiority multicenter trial , randomize 2 parallel group evaluate antibiotic treatment ( 5d vs 10d ) uncomplicated AP . Recruitment follow-up : The management patient initially provide emergency room department hospital clinic . After sign consent inclusion ( J0 ) , patient receive initial assessment , initiation antibiotic therapy care . Then : - Either hospital service follow . - Either ambulatory monitoring regularly contact ( phone voice server ) ensure proper development . Randomisation take place J0 . Finally , case , final visit set J30 ± 5Day . 4 . Origin nature data collect - Reasons Data study duration treatment pyelonephritis information provide patient . The nature data include : name , surname , date birth , medical data ( medical history , history disease , symptoms infection ) telephone number patient . The collection number essential monitoring patient . 5 . Method data flow These data confidential , physician investigator , scientific coordinator doctor , doctor treat patient clinical research fellow , access information . These data computerize protected personal access code . 6 . Duration modality research The duration research maximum 24 month ( duration 12 month inclusion follow-up 310 patient ) . Research multicenter ( 26 center ) lead principal investigator ( Pr . Louis Bernard ) scientific coordinator ( Dr. AURELIEN DINH ) At end study , data destroyed .</detailed_description>
