	<brief_summary>The aim investigator study compare two different bond agent affect retention preventive dental procedure pit fissure sealant . This study help decide whether self etch bonding agent require less step completion effective total etch bonding agent require multiple step fissure sealant placement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pit fissure sealant hail highly effective preventive dental treatment since introduce first late 1970s . Sealants traditionally place use two step bond agent base acid etch phosphoric acid follow dry bond agent application cure . Multiple step application bond agent associate chance procedure error prolong procedure time . The new bonding agent base minimize number step involve introduction self etch bond agents.6th generation adhesive base mix two component 7th generation adhesive base mix technique . Previous study fissure sealant focus conventional etch rinse bond agent , publish study effectiveness self etch bond agent retention fissure sealant vivo target 6th generation adhesive . Feigal Quelhas report equivocal result use self etch bond agent comparison etch rinse bonding agent , study limit small sample size . Similar study conduct Burbridge base short clinical follow 6 month evaluation Xeno III Dentsply ( 6th generation bond agent ) compare Prime &amp; Bond ( Dentsply ) . Another study Venker et al Adper Prompt L Pop school sealant program base retrospective review case . In light publish literature ( 6th generation ) self etch bond agent find equal inferior total etch bonding agent ( 5th generation ) . There publish clinical trial retentiong rate comparison total etch bonding agent mix slef etch bond agent pit fissure sealant . Our study base comparison effectiveness single step bond agent ( 7th generation adhesive ) versus two step bond agent fissure sealant retention .</detailed_description>
