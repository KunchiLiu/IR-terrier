	<brief_summary>Obesity multifactorial disease affect million people worldwide . It main independent risk factor develop type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Most patient T2DM glucose intolerance ( GI ) overweight , condition know diabesity . In patient severe form obesity , i.e. , morbid obesity , likelihood develop disease associate obesity increase . The investigator currently know bariatric surgery provide sustained weight loss well-documented remission T2DM . Patients undergo bariatric surgery show long-term reduced mortality coronary artery disease , cancer diabetes ; 136 life save per 10,000 surgical procedure perform . Bariatric surgery relatively safe procedure become increasingly well-accepted ; 2007 , approximately 170,000 bariatric procedure perform USA . Currently , bariatric surgery effective choice treatment morbidly obese patient diabetes . The surgical procedure currently perform treat morbid obesity divide two main group : gastric restrictive procedure combination procedure ; latter combine gastric restriction malabsorption . The roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) combination procedure frequently perform , whereas sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) emerge restrictive procedure . SG perform first two-stage operation patient high risk death , definitive surgical procedure . It show good result regard weight loss glycemic control various study . The potential advantage SG include low probability vitamin mineral deficiency procedure malabsorptive component ; access entire intestinal tract ; need subcutaneous access port adjustment ; absence dump syndrome low probability intestinal obstruction . In addition , SG perform patient inflammatory bowel disease undergone bowel surgery , easily convert RYGB . Both SG RYGB perform without placement Silastic® ring . The metabolic control achieve bariatric procedure demonstrate reproduce various medical center worldwide . Metabolic control achieve gastric restrictive procedure vertical band gastroplasty , adjustable gastric banding , recently , SG . However , show glucose homeostasis affect various intestinal mechanism observe exclusively procedure include malabsorptive element , RYGB . A systematic review 22,094 case morbidly obese patient submit bariatric surgery show resolution T2DM achieve 76.8 % case , improvement achieve 86 % case . Among criterion use diagnose metabolic syndrome , fast glucose level first return normal patient submit Silastic® ring gastric bypass ( SRGB ) , modification traditional RYGB consist add Silastic® ring gastric bypass operation . Normoglycemia bariatric procedure , well diabesity , multifactorial . Normoglycemia observe result dietary control , decrease plasma level ghrelin , weight loss reduction body fat , well release gastrointestinal hormone interfere function pancreatic β cell ( incretins ) . The main purpose study compare weight loss morbidly obese patient submit either Silastic® ring sleeve gastrectomy ( SRSG ) SRGB , well compare effect procedure glucose homeostasis morbidly obese patient .</brief_summary>
