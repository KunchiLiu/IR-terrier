	<detailed_description>The Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study/Phase 2 3.25 year observational follow-up study child enrol Childhood Asthma Management Program ( CAMP ) randomize trial . CAMPCS/2 multicenter National Heart , Lung Blood Institute program . The objective CAMPCS/2 determine consequence childhood asthma treatment asthma outcomes young adulthood . This separate ancillary study extend core CAMP/CAMPCS work focus progression airway obstruction childhood asthma evaluate mechanism progression describe difference four separate pattern airway obstruction evolved time . The four pattern airway obstruction identify follow : ( 1 ) abnormal obstruction present early childhood remain abnormal ( Low/Low group ) ( 2 ) initially normal ratio , worsen abnormal range time ( Normal/Low group ) . These pattern unfavorable outcome compare two pattern favorable outcome : ( 3 ) initially abnormal ratio improve time ( Low/Normal group ) ( 4 ) normal ratio throughout follow-up ( Normal/Normal group ) . Based four pattern , three specific hypothesis related immunology , structure , physiology identify : 1 . Among school-aged child mild moderate asthma , child increase airflow limitation ( i.e . low FEV1/FVC ) end CAMPCS ( Normal/Low Low/Low group ) elevate marker inflammation relate proteolysis ( i.e . neutrophil elastase , matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP9 ) , tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 ( TIMP1 ) neutrophils sputum ) . 2 . Subjects show pattern early progression failure resolve ( Low/Low group ) clinical evidence steroid insensitivity compare slow progression ( Normal/Low group ) . They also vitro evidence steroid resistance compare Normal/Low Normal/Normal group . This pattern obstruction may due irreversible change consistent airway remodel inflammation relatively refractory steroid therapy . 3 . Children ongoing airflow limitation ( Normal/Low Low/Low group ) prominent structural change relate increase air trap airway thicken compare normal FEV1/FVC end CAMPCS ( Low/Normal Normal/Normal group ) . Each participant study vary time 2-year study period . Researchers complete collection sputum , blood , urine , exhale breath condensate sample ; exhale nitric oxide ; spirometry CAMPCS/3 participant , represent four phenotype ( n = 20 total 80 ) .</detailed_description>
