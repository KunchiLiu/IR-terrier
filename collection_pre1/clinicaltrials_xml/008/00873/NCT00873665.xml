	<detailed_description>We propose single-site , prospective randomize trial determine effect aerobic exercise training ED among 50 sedentary men undergo radical prostatectomy clinically localized prostate cancer . This project three specific aim : - Specific Aim # 1 : To determine effect aerobic exercise training versus wait-list control incidence ED among sedentary men undergo radical prostatectomy clinically localized prostate cancer . - Hypothesis # 1 : Aerobic exercise training associate significantly low incidence ED compare usual care among sedentary men undergo radical prostatectomy clinically localized prostate cancer . - Specific Aim # 2 : To determine effect aerobic exercise training versus wait-list control change patient symptom ( i.e. , erectile function score , sexual functioning , urinary incontinence , QOL ) number men receive phosphodiesterase type-5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor therapy well therapy dose . - Hypothesis # 2 : Aerobic exercise training improve patient symptom reduce number men require PDE-5 inhibitor therapy . - Specific Aim # 3 : To determine effect aerobic exercise training versus wait-list control change postulate biologic mechanism may underlie relationship exercise training ED [ i.e. , CVD risk factor ( cardiorespiratory fitness , lipid profile , blood pressure , c-reactive protein , body composition ) , cardiac function , penile brachial artery endothelial function ] . - Hypothesis # 3 : Aerobic exercise training associate favorable change postulate candidate mechanism .</detailed_description>

Radical prostatectomyinduced ED immediate progressive disorder intervention shortly follow surgery may effective attenuate disorder . It expect men undergone radical prostatectomy fully recover 46 week post surgery receptive exercise intervention study time ( capitalize teachable moment ) . Additionally , PI demonstrate maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test safe , feasible , acceptable assessment procedure 7±3 day postcraniotomy among 20 primary high grade primary brain tumor patient 30±5 day postpneumonectomy lobectomy among 20 operable nonsmall cell lung cancer patient , 3 . Karnofsky performance status least 70 % study entry , 4 . Estimated life expectancy ≥6 month , 5 . Ability read understand English , 6 . Primary attend urologist approval ( Drs . Donatucci Moul ) , 7 . Signed informed consent prior initiation studyrelated procedure , 8 . Willingness randomize , 9 . Sedentary ( i.e. , men perform regular exercise least 5 day week , least 30 minute session , moderate vigorous intensity past month ) . This definition consistent national exercise recommendation guideline ensure men currently engage regular exercise ( i.e. , likely benefit ) recruit , 10 . Postoperative erectile function ( score ≤21 International Index Erectile Function ( IIEF ) multidimensional questionnaire90 ) . To avoid potential ceiling effect ( i.e. , test intervention among men good erectile function ) , men IIEF score ≤21 , indicate ED , recruit . 1 . Presence concurrent , actively treated malignancy history malignancy treat within past 3 year ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) , 2 . Presence metastatic disease , 3 .
