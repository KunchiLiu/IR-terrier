	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue laboratory patient cancer may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This laboratory study look biomarkers predict response treatment patient undergone surgery pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Predicting Response Treatment Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine method extract identify biomarkers ( i.e. , secrete cytokine growth factor ) tissue quantity obtain typical biopsy apply set pancreatic cancer - To correlate pre-treatment biomarkers recurrence , overall survival , tumor response radiotherapy chemotherapy patient pancreatic cancer . OUTLINE : Tumor tissue specimen obtain Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center Human Tissue Acquisition Core analyze biomarkers ( e.g. , integrity DNA repair pathway analyze Rad51 phosphorylated DNA-PK foci formation ) . The biomarkers correlate clinical outcome ( recurrence , overall survival , tumor response treatment ) . Patients follow recurrence , relapse , death disease .</detailed_description>
