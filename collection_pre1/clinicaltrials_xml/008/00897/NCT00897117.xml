	<brief_title>Collecting Analyzing Tissue Samples From Patients Undergoing Surgery Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Develop statistical computational method model relationship multiple variable protein RNA expression data clinical endpoint use supervise unsupervised classification pattern recognition approach . - Determine protein RNA expression fingerprint completely resect non-small cell lung cancer without prior chemotherapy . - Correlate protein RNA expression fingerprint T-stage nodal involvement time surgery , collect outcome data allow correlation recurrence ( local and/or distant ) survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Any excess tissue remove surgery would otherwise discard ( tissue use diagnosis and/or treatment decision making ) obtain study . Tissue analyze molecular feature predict biologic behavior . Quantitation RNA , gene expression profile , protein expression pattern assess matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time flight mass spectroscopy microarray analysis . Medical record review obtain information result test associate cancer diagnosis . Further progress cancer treatment tumor behavior surgery follow via record review .</detailed_description>
