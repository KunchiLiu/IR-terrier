	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue blood laboratory patient cancer may help doctor learn change occur genetic material ( DNA RNA ) may also identify protein expression pattern related cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This research study evaluate change DNA , RNA , proteins goal predict response treatment patient lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine protein and/or RNA expression pattern capable predict tumor response therapy tumor tissue sample patient lung cancer suspect lung cancer . - To characterize gene protein find predictive response order help elucidate molecular biology underlie cancer chemosensitivity . - To evaluate DNA mutation find within lung cancer sample may predictive response resistance certain therapeutic agent . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection tumor tissue percutaneous fine needle aspiration , core biopsy , thoracentesis , medically indicated procedure involve removal lung cancer tissue . Tissue sample analyze variety technique , include DNA sequencing , RNA sequence expression level , protein assessment [ immunohistochemistry , western blot , Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-MS ] ) . The goal study identify gene mutation , gene expression level , proteins predictive treatment response . Blood sample also collect obtain normal DNA analysis . After completion study , patient follow death .</detailed_description>
