	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This laboratory study look biomarkers predict outcome postmenopausal woman hormone receptor-positive , node-positive breast cancer treat tamoxifen without cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , fluorouracil .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine value Oncotype DX Recurrence Score prediction treatment benefit cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , fluorouracil ( CAF ) chemotherapy , term disease-free survival ( DFS ) overall survival ( OS ) , postmenopausal patient estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive , node-positive breast cancer treat clinical trial SWOG-8814 . - Determine overall prognostic value Oncotype DX Recurrence Score , term DFS OS , patient treat tamoxifen citrate alone CAF concurrent sequential tamoxifen citrate . Secondary - Determine optimal cut point ( i.e. , low , intermediate , high recurrence risk ) Recurrence Score patient . - Determine relationship expression one 21 gene Oncotype DX gene panel DFS OS . - Determine whether expression gene associate CAF treatment benefit . - Determine relationship Oncotype DX Recurrence Score DFS OS multivariate model , include number positive node , tumor size , tumor grade , estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , HER2 p53 status . - Determine relationship quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction expression 800 additional gene prognosis and/or prediction CAF benefit . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Fixed paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissue sample ( obtain SWOG Central Tumor Repository University Colorado ) analyze Oncotype DX panel contain follow 21 gene : BAG1 , Bc12 , CCNB1 , CD68 , SCUBE2 , CTSL2 , Esrt1 , GRB7 , GSTM1 , HER2 , Ki-67 , MYBL2 , PR , STK15 , STMY3 , SURV , B-actin , GAPDH , GUS , RPLPO , TFRC . The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score calculate patient . Analyses perform determine relationship Recurrence Score gene expression prognosis/prediction therapy ( tamoxifen citrate alone cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , fluorouracil concurrent sequential tamoxifen citrate ) benefit well determine relationship clinical demographic covariates disease-free overall survival . Samples also analyze reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction exploratory analysis 800 additional gene may prognostic and/or predict likelihood therapy benefit .</detailed_description>
