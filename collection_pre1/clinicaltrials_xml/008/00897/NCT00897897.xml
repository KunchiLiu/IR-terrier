	<brief_summary>This study confirm safety technical effectiveness MRI guide High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) ablate uterine tissue associate symptomatic leiomyoma . The importance therapy offer non-invasive , uterine spar procedure treatment uterine fibroid pre- peri- menopausal woman . MRI guide high intensity focus ultrasound us ultrasound heat thermally ablate fibroid tissue . The MRI system identifies ultrasound path monitor heat rise fibroid tissue . The goal study show treatment safety technical effectiveness . MR-guided HIFU perform patient pass inclusion/exclusion criterion . Safety , quality life , image endpoint evaluate study patient . The goal study demonstrate : 1 . The safety profile acceptable ( safety ) 2 . Actual MR-HIFU ablate volume ( measure contrast enhance MRI ) match intend volume ( technical effectiveness ) 3 . When intend , volume great 20 % fibroid volume successfully ablate ( technical effectiveness ) The investigator ' hypothesis great 70 % fibroid concordance intend lesion volume actual lesion volume maintain acceptable safety profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) -Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) Ablation Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibroids occur 20-50 % woman 30 year age , increase size produce pain , menorrhagia , pressure , bloat urinary bowel compression symptom . Fibroids may also cause infertility . Uterine leiomyoma benign tumor originate smooth muscle cell uterus occasionally smooth muscle uterine blood vessel . Fibroids estrogen dependent tumor range size number find within myometrium ( intramural ) , uterine periphery extend serosa ( subserosal ) , push uterine cavity ( submucosal ) . Symptomatic fibroid impact health well-being female include lose work hour reduce quality life . Current medical treatment include invasive removal fibroid ( hysterectomy , myomectomy ) , drug therapy ( GnRH analogues progestin compound ) treatment cause necrosis fibroid tissue ablation ( freeze heating ) embolization . For relief symptom , woman wish preserve uterus may choose invasive procedure myomectomy , Uterine Artery Embolization ( UAE ) , ablation cryotherapy . The surgically invasive procedure require anesthesia , hospital stay , long recovery period . HIFU may offer alternative mention surgically invasive procedure . In MRI-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) , ultrasound generate transducer focus small focal tissue volume specific target location . During treatment , beam focus ultrasound energy penetrates soft tissue cause localize high temperature ( 55°C 70°C ) second within target produce well define region protein denaturation , irreversible cell damage , coagulative necrosis . The MRI system allow 3D planning , mean measuring temperature increase generate HIFU , capability quantify energy/dose deliver treatment zone . This study multi-center , single arm , non-randomized trial evaluate safety , technical effectiveness volume treatment capability Philips MR-guided HIFU system treatment symptomatic uterine fibroid patient . Patients symptomatic uterine fibroid , eligible accord inclusion exclusion criterion provide inform consent enrol study . It anticipate woman participate study 2month period include screening , HIFU treatment post treatment follow-up . This clinical study design confirm safety demonstrate technical effectiveness Philips HIFU system Uterine Fibroid treatment . Safety primarily assess evaluate minor complication adverse event , technical effectiveness primarily assess MRI measurement . Specific primary secondary endpoint detail . The study use combination three primary endpoint : MR image ablate volume minor complications/adverse event analysis establish safety technical effectiveness Philips MR-HIFU system . These endpoint determine trial success . The treatment capabilities technical effectiveness Philips MR-guided HIFU system assess ( measurement type note parenthesis ) 1 . Comparing actual MR-measured ablate volume MR thermal dose predict volume Safety Philips MR-guided HIFU system demonstrate 2 . Evaluating minor complication adverse event result MR-guided HIFU treatment 3 . Verifying MR image unintended lesion form result Treatment Our hypothesis great 70 % fibroid concordance intend lesion volume actual lesion volume maintain acceptable safety profile . In addition , follow endpoint collect supplement primary outcome : 4 . Pain discomfort score , treatment : These endpoint record use 10-point visual analog scale pain 4-point scale discomfort . 5 . Return Activity : This duration day determine time patient return work ( i.e . day leave hospital ) usual activity employ . 6 . Length Hospital Stay ( LOS ) : This duration hour measure time patient arrive hospital leave hospital . 7 . Quality Life questionnaire : SF-36 ( http : //www.sf36.org/tools/SF36.shtml ) UFS-QoL ( include SSS )</detailed_description>
