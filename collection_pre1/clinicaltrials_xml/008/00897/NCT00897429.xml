	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate impact loss p21 mutation p53 relationship high intake Western dietary pattern ( manifest higher red meat total fat intake low n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , fruit vegetable intake ) colon cancer recurrence/mortality . ( B1 ) II . To evaluate impact mutate v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( K-ras ) , mutate p53 , phorphorylated ( phospho ) -v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( Akt ) overexpression , p27 loss relationship obesity , physical activity dietary glycemic intake colon cancer recurrence/mortality . ( B1 ) III . To evaluate impact tumoral cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) overexpression , high tumor microvessel density intact p21 relationship aspirin use colon cancer recurrence . ( B1 ) IV . To define association type extent genomic instability clinical outcome stage III colon cancer treat resection adjuvant chemotherapy ( CALGB 89803 ) . ( B2 ) V. To assess ability prognostic gene expression signature stratify stage II colorectal cancer patient experience relapse within five year post surgery ( high risk ) experience five-year disease free survival ( low risk ) , without additional treatment . ( B3 ) VI . To determine whether significant relationship risk recurrence continuous 12-gene recurrence score ( RS ) measure growth hormone insufficiency ( GHI ) assay gene expression , use pre-specified gene Recurrence Score algorithm . ( B4 ) VII . To determine whether significant relationship risk recurrence continuous 15-gene RS2 measure GHI assay gene expression , use pre-specified gene second-generation Recurrence Score algorithm . ( B4 ) VIII . To assess methylation status mutL homolog 1 ( MLH1 ) , o-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) , Werner syndrome ( WRN ) tumor obtain patient enrolled treatment arm CALGB 89803 . ( B5 ) IX . Determine expression DNA repair pathway protein assess methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction ( MSP ) assay well expression DNA repair protein know interact epigenetically silenced DNA repair protein use validated immunostaining assay . ( B5 ) X . Recognition cytosine phosphate guanine ( CpG ) island methylator phenotype ( CIMP ) gene . ( B5 ) XI . To understand relationship tumor gene methylation status epigenetic silence DNA repair pathway gene . ( B5 ) XII . To examine newly identify prognostic biomarkers ( long intersperse nucleotide element 1 [ LINE-1 ] methylation , phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha [ PIK3CA ] mutation , v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 [ BRAF ] mutation , fatty acid synthase [ FASN ] expression vitamin D receptor [ VDR ] expression ) stage III colon cancer ( CALGB 89803 ) detail lifestyle , treatment follow-up data correlate survival . ( B6 ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define association type extent genomic instability microsatellite instability p53 mutation , previously characterize tumor Drs . Warren Bertagnolli . ( B2 ) II . Associations marker determine future time characterize collaborator . ( B2 ) III . To determine whether 12-gene RS provide significant information beyond clinical pathologic measure , include T stage , mismatch repair system ( MMR ) status , number lymph node examine , tumor grade , lymphovascular invasion . ( B4 ) IV . To determine whether 15-gene RS2 provide significant information beyond clinical pathologic measure , include T stage , MMR status , number lymph node examine , tumor grade , lymphovascular invasion . ( B4 ) V. To compare risk recurrence high low recurrence risk group base pre-specified percentile cut-points 12-gene RS . ( B4 ) VI . To compare risk recurrence high low recurrence risk group base pre-specified percentile cut-points 15-gene RS2 . ( B4 ) VII . To determine , panel select new gene ( 768 gene ) , whether significant relationship gene expression recurrence-free interval ( RFI ) . ( B4 ) VIII . To define association CIMP methylated gene genetic alteration tumor-specific characteristic . ( B5 ) IX . To study influence diet lifestyle factor cancer recurrence treatment-related toxicity patient participate trial . ( B6 ) OUTLINE : Previously collect tissue sample analyze K-ras mutation ; COX-2 , phospho-AKT , VEGF overexpression ; microvessel density ; association genomic instability microsatellite instability p53 mutation ; methylation status MLH1 , MGMT , WRN identify prognostic biomarkers LINE-1 hypomethylation , PIK3CA mutation , BRAF mutation , FASN expression , VDR expression via immunohistochemistry , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , RT-PCR , microarray .</detailed_description>
