	<brief_title>Collecting Tumor Samples From Patients With Gynecological Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect gynecologic tissue blood participate Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) institution . II . To provide repository long-term storage gynecologic tissue blood use study design well understand molecular biology gynecologic tumor . III . To make available , GOG Tissue Bank , tissue blood propose project conduct GOG non-GOG investigator . OUTLINE : Snap frozen tumor tissue , OCT mold tumor tissue , formalin-preserved tumor tissue , buffy coat-prepared tumor tissue , blood sample collect stored repository . Patient information keep confidential , patient inform research/test result use tissue .</detailed_description>
