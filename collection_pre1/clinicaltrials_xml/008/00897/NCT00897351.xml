	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue blood laboratory patient cancer may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This research study look tissue blood sample patient recurrent prostate cancer receive lapatinib clinical trial ECOG-E5803 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Tissue Blood Samples From Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer Who Received Lapatinib Clinical Trial ECOG-E5803</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine association polymorphism drug metabolize enzyme lapatinib ditosylate-associated toxicity patient hormone-sensitive recurrent prostate cancer receive lapatinib ditosylate clinical trial ECOG-E5803 . - To determine association mutation EGFR , HER-2 Kras ; protein expression HER2 , EGFR , MAPK AKT ; polymorphism control androgen synthesis ; progression-free survival . OUTLINE : Tissue blood sample collect patient enrol clinical trial ECOG-E5803 analyze correlative study . Samples assess HER2 , EGFR , MAPK , Akt ; EGFR mutation polymorphisms CYP3A4 ; Ras mutation ; recently identify mutation HER2-neu Kras ; additional polymorphism lapatinib ditosylate metabolic pathway automate quantitative IHC . Predictors efficacy toxicity analyze , include marker EGFR pathway predictor progression-free survival .</detailed_description>
