	<brief_title>Exploring Learning Needs Individuals With Inflammatory Arthritis From Perspectives Patients , Family Members Friends , Health Care Providers : Patient Perspectives ( Focus Groups )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PROTOCOL ____________________________________________________________________ Exploring Learning Needs Individuals Inflammatory Arthritis Perspectives Patients , Family Members Friends , Health Care Providers : Patient Perspectives _____________________________________________________________________ RATIONALE Rheumatic diseases chronic , lifelong illness result significant pain , disability , morbidity Canadian population ( Perruccio , Power &amp; Badley , 2006 ) . Focusing one aspect rheumatic disease , inflammatory arthritis associate aforementioned concern , also increase burden care affect patient , extend impact include family member , friend , caregiver . Inflammatory arthritis also associate significant increase healthcare budget ( Hunsche , Chancellor &amp; Bruce , 2001 ) . Care management disease expect high demand burden illness estimate rise ( Perruccio , Power &amp; Badley , 2006 ) . The number primary care provider specialist sufficient meet anticipated increase , ( Beaulieu et al. , 2004 ; Glazier et al. , 2003 ) patient deal chronic disease increasingly require self-manage disease . This stressful daunt process newly diagnose patient may result delay decision-making ultimately , delay disease treatment . While physician care undeniably important management inflammatory arthritis , educate patient knowledge skill self-manage disease helpful decision-making process reduce healthcare burden . For example , Lorig et al ( 2001 ) demonstrate individual well able self-manage illness experience significant improvement health behaviour , self-efficacy , health status , few visit emergency department . By equip patient strategy cope enhance personal health , take active role management disease able take health promoting activity little supervision healthcare professional ( Keysor et al. , 2003 ) . In fact , patient education self-management identified arthritis best-practice key clinical practice guideline ( Combe et al. , 2007 ; Holbrook , 2000 ; Jordan et al. , 2003 ) . Patient education take many form , peer support intervention particularly effective help patient manage chronic disease , include HIV , alcoholism diabetes . Likewise , hope examine benefit , challenge , impact peer support individual live inflammatory arthritis . A peer someone share common characteristic , age , gender , social economic status , education , religion , case , status disease ( Doull et al. , 2005 ) . Peers experiential knowledge rheumatic disease , management care , social implication life . Within healthcare context , provide assistance individual live arthritis provide support emotional , appraisal , informational need . Peers potential influence health outcome patient address feeling isolation loneliness , promote positive outlook motivation , provide information behavior encourage health well-being ( Dennis , 2003 ) . They augment service provide healthcare professional help individual inflammatory arthritis well cope manage illness . While peer support group use address many chronic disease , implementation amongst individual inflammatory arthritis limit . The effectiveness program dependent educational preference learn needs participant topic require examination assessment . PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE This project address one subcomponent large study overall purpose explore learn need ( informational need , emotional need , appraisal need ) educational preference individual inflammatory arthritis . The impact formal informal peer support individual rheumatic disease improvement health well-being also examine emphasis peer support perspective patient live disease . This project focus solicit perspective patient inflammatory arthritis . To good understand learn needs potential impact peer support strategy , include context , circumstance , process involve make peer support effective intervention . This project , particular , examine : - perspective individual inflammatory arthritis regard disease management educational need - feel emotional , informational , appraisal need - specific feedback seek related peer support - whether need change progression duration disease course METHODOLOGY Qualitative examination aforementioned objective carry use focus group . Study Design Eligible study participant divide three focus group 6-8 participant base disease duration : - 0-6 month - Over 6 month - 2 year - 2 - 5 year Each focus group comprise individual inflammatory disease mixed age gender . Focus group session hold several week time convenient participant . This do order avoid conflict work shift schedule . Informed , write consent also obtain potential participant ( Appendix 1 - Information Sheet Appendix 2 - Consent Form ) . Two second-year medical student co-investigators and/or study coordinator University Toronto present focus group session . A semi-structured interview guide use ( Appendix 3 - Interview Guide ) probe prompt discussion appropriate . One medical student conduct focus group second student study coordinator keep speaker log take note throughout session . Each participant assign number record keep first phrase speaker . The speaker log use aid analysis ( i.e . clarify view express number people one person many time ) . During focus group discussion , first name participant use . Focus group session run approximately 1 ½ - 2 hour duration . After every session , medical student/study coordinator create field note independently record thought impression interview , non-verbal communication , conversation record meeting . Each focus group session also record use digital audio recorder transcribe whole part . Transcribed names remove , instead replace assigned speaker number . Subjects Potential focus group participant meet follow criterion : - Have diagnosis inflammatory arthritis physician - Be able participate 1 ½- 2 hour focus group session - Be age 18 year old - Be English-speaking - Be able get focus group session Recruitment Consent Potential research participant identify Rheumatology clinic Sunnybrook Health Science Centre ( SHSC ) . They approach Dr. Mary Bell ( Principal Investigator ) , staff Rheumatologist , introduce study eligible individual obtain verbal consent contact medical student co-investigator assign project . The name individual forward Office Manager schedule interview Rheumatology clinic . At interview , medical student go information letter study consent form eligible patient ensure potential research participant understand study he/she ask . Once write consent obtain , copy provide participant . A confirmation letter ( Appendix 4 - Confirmation Letter Research Participants ) time location interview/focus group mail participant . The day interview schedule take place medical student telephone individual remind time location interview use Telephone Script ( Appendix 5 - Telephone Script Confirm Interview ) . At begin interview , prior ask question , medical student obtain write consent answer question participant may . DATA ANALYSIS Transcripts analyze use content analysis order systematically make inference text . Interview data import NVIV0 8 qualitative software package analyze use constant comparative method two research team member present focus group discussion . Medical student train qualitative content analysis . Interview data categorize theme team member independently use iterative cod scheme develop team . To ensure consistency cod , research team member complete focus group frequently meet Principle Investigator study coordinator ensure consistency cod verify credibility code . New code add theme arise data analysis . The individual conduct focus group independently code transcript subsequently meet compare result cod agree upon understand theme emerge . By cross-referencing , rigor study increase . Modifications make interview guide subsequent interview include new question probe come prior focus group discussion . Field note also use inform analysis . RISKS AND BENEFITS There know risk may associate study . Participants may become upset emotional focus group session nature discussion require open , honest sharing . The research team make available list support group help-lines reinforce care participant affect way individual decide withdraw study . These group discussion benefit participant share discover individual relate disease experience . Individuals arthritis Ontario may indirectly benefit event research help develop peer support intervention individual inflammatory arthritis may implement part patient care process . The result study may help validate importance support base experiential knowledge decision-making , health promotion , education may encourage implementation peer support group among individual live inflammatory arthritis . PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY Only Principal Investigator , Office Manager medical students/study coordinator conduct focus group session aware identity participant . All data collection form identify information remove replaced unique identify number . A list participant name , address , phone number keep password protect computer secure server lock research room rheumatology clinic Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre access Principle Investigator research team involve study . Names identify information use publication , report , presentation pass anyone else outside research team study . All information collect focus group session keep confidential . Hard copy data lock research room Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre storage 25 year destroy . All electronic data file ( i.e. , audiofiles , transcript ) store password protect computer secure server lock office Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre rheumatology clinic . A confidentiality agreement sign study coordinator second year medical student involve study . COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS In term report study result , write report create sent participant involve study upon request .
