	<brief_summary>This study design assess safety initial indication efficacy result multiple dos CAVATAK inject directly solid tumour Head Neck confirm express ICAM-1 DAF . CAVATAK ( Coxsackievirus A21 ) naturally occur common cold virus preclinical research indicate preferentially infect kill cancer cell express receptor ICAM-1 and/or DAF . This virus know cause self limit upper respiratory infection use previously challenge therapy common cold . The virus generically modify . The study propose administer CAVATAK three cohort three patient . The first cohort receive single dose , second cohort receive three dos , final cohort receive six dos . There 48 hour interval repeat dos . The primary objective study determine safety efficacy CVA21 give intratumoural injection treatment recurrent , unresectable squamous cell carcinoma head neck measure primary field tumour status adverse effect . Secondary objective study : 1 . Indirect measurement efficacy measure appropriate biomarkers serum tumour biopsy sample viral replication , induction apoptosis anti-tumour immune response . 2 . To determine time course potential primary secondary viraemia . 3 . To characterise time course anti-CVA21 antibody response administration CVA21</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients willing able provide write informed consent participate study . 2 . Patients histologically confirm metastatic recurrent squamous cell carcinoma head neck currently document `` progressive disease '' 3 . Head neck cancer patient least one tumour mass tumour mass accessible intratumoural injection measure periodic interval tumour size use calliper and/or ultrasound . 4 . All patient histologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( exclude nasopharyngeal ) recur relapse surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy . 5 . The long diameter target injectable tumour great 6 cm less 1 cm long diameter . 6 . The tumour mass intratumourally inject easily accessible injection amenable measurement physical examination / radiographically . 7 . Patients 18 year old 8 . Absence circulate antibody CVA21 ( titre &lt; 1:16 ) . 9 . Adequate haematological , hepatic renal function , define : ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L , platelet &gt; 100 x 109/L Bilirubin &lt; 20Âµmol/L , AST &lt; 2.5 time upper limit normal Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/minute Adequate immunologic function , define : Serum IgG &gt; 5g/L T cell subset within normal limit 10 . Fertile male female must agree use adequate form contraception . Hormonal contraceptive supplement additional barrier method . Negative pregnancy test require female patient childbearing potential . 1 . Patients receive radiotherapy propose injected tumour radiotherapy within last 3 week 2 . Performance status &gt; 1 ECOG scale 3 . Life expectancy &lt; 3 month . 4 . Pregnancy breastfeed . 5 . Primary secondary immunodeficiency , include immunosuppressive disease , immunosuppressive dos corticosteroid ( e.g . prednisolone &gt; 7.5mg per day ) immunosuppressive medication include cyclosporine , azathioprine , interferon , within past 4 week . 6 . Positive serology HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C. 7 . Splenectomy . 8 . Presence uncontrolled infection . 9 . Any uncontrolled medical condition opinion Investigator likely place patient unacceptable risk study reduce ability complete study 10 . Participation another study require administration investigational drug biological agent within last 4 week 11 . Known allergy treatment medication excipients 12 . Tumours inject lie mucosal region close airway , major blood vessel spinal cord , opinion Investigators , could cause occlusion compression case tumour swell erosion major vessel case necrosis</criteria>
