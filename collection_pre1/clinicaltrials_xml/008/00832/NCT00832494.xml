	<brief_title>Phase II Study DMXAA ( ASA404 ) Combination With Chemotherapy Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design determine safety , tolerability efficacy DMXAA combination carboplatin paclitaxel patient locally advanced metastatic ( Stage IIIb IV ) non-small cell lung cancer . The phase Ib part study evaluate dose level DMXAA 600 mg/m2 , 1200 mg/m2 1800 mg/m2 . In phase II part study , patient randomize receive carboplatin paclitaxel alone combination ASA404 1200 mg/m2 . An additional single-arm study undertaken evaluate patient 1800 mg/m2 dose level .</detailed_description>
