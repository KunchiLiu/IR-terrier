	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine response lung tumor radiation therapy . This study use type radiation therapy call tomotherapy . Tomotherapy relatively new kind therapy able focus large amount radiation small area relatively le radiation surround non-cancerous part organ . This study do find technique able control cancer well standard radiation also study safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Using Tomotherapy Tumors Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The introduction stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) allow safe dose escalation treatment regimens cancer . Several study show radiation dose-response relationship survival local control tumor lung , include cancer originates lung ( non-small cell lung cancer ) well cancer metastasize lung . The purpose study determine response rate toxicity SBRT treatment patient lung tumor . This study use dose 60 gray ( Gy ) 5 fraction 12 Gy . This provide biological equivalent dose alpha/beta ratio 10 ( BED10 ) 132 Gy anticipation achieve local control without increase toxicity . Previous study show response rate SBRT across multiple study approximately 50 % , additional 25-40 % patient stable disease . We hypothesize regimen achieve response rate 70 % grade 3 toxicity less 5 % .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic confirmation non small cell lung cancer solid primary tumor metastatic lung 2 . Medically inoperable stage I II non small cell lung cancer negative lymph node metastatic cancer lung less equal 3 lesion 3 . Age great equal 18 year old 4 . Zubrod performance status less equal 1 5 . Negative pregnancy test woman child bear potential 6 . Informed consent 7 . Each lesion must less equal 5 cm maximal diameter multiple lesion must less equal 18 cm sum diameter 3 dimension . Example : 3 lesion 2+2+2 cm aggregate diameter 18 cm acceptable . 8 . No prior radiation lesion treat 9 . For metastatic disease lung , primary tumor need control ( evidence progression image least 2 month ) . 1 . Contraindications radiation 2 . Within touch zone proximal bronchial tree define volume 2 cm direction around proximal bronchial tree ( carina , right leave main bronchus , right leave upper lobe bronchus , intermedius bronchus , right middle lobe bronchus , lingular bronchus , right leave low lobe bronchus ) 3 . Pregnant lactating female choose breast feed 4 . Patients must recover toxicity prior therapy 5 . Any co morbid condition ' view attend physician ' render patient high risk treatment complication 6 . Cytologically positive pleural effusion</criteria>
