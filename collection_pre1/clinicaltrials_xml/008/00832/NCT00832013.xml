	<brief_summary>Advances health care require child give sedation allow doctor perform investigation minor procedure . Sedation drug traditionally give orally ( swallow ) child . However , oral sedation drug unpredictable characteristic , duration sedation , may result difficulty perform planned procedure . Anesthetic drug invariably use sedation child . These give IV ( skinny plastic tube insert vein ) . Propofol ( white liquid ) anesthetic drug commonly use sedation BC Children 's Hospital sedation . Propofol several advantage , include accurately controllable depth sedation ( deeply asleep ) , minimal effect heart circulation control reflex ( e , g cough ) procedure . Propofol also promote rapid recovery less sickness earlier return normal function following procedure . While propofol many advantage cause respiratory depression ( reduce breathe rate ) . This reduction breathe common propofol give quickly . When child give propofol propose procedure perform pediatric anesthesiologist skilled support breathing require . If child participate study still receive propofol administer anesthesiologist usual practice . It would routine administer propofol rapidly support breathe minute . This safe hand expert anesthesiologist sometimes risky setting extensive monitoring anesthesiologist available . This set propofol use many institution . Our goal determine quickly propofol give without reduce breathe point help breathing require .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose Advances minimally invasive radiological surgical technique demand increase number child give sedation anesthesia facilitate procedure , frequently perform out-patient day-care basis . Most performed outside operating room environment , intensivists emergency physician administer 55 % sedation episode , 19 % performed anesthesiologist North America . It well document risk complication sedation exceed experience much control environment general anesthesia , twelve-fold increase risk mortality sedation administer outside operating room . Sedative agent traditionally administer orally child . However , characteristic oral sedation drug , unpredictable depth duration sedation result variable drug absorption prolong duration drug effect , result high failure complication rate . Recently , intravenous ( IV ) anesthetic drug accurately titratable predictable characteristic gain popularity variety sedation procedure . Propofol commonly use intravenous agent procedure North America . Hypothesis The maximum safe infusion rate induction dose propofol administer child sedation reliably predict . Safety optimize prevent apnoea whilst minimize time induction sedation ensure adequate depth sedation achieve . Justification Propofol intravenous ( IV ) anesthetic agent use induction maintenance anesthesia adult child . Propofol several characteristic favour use , include accurately titratable depth anesthesia , cardiovascular stability , suppression upper airway reflex , rapid recovery reduce post-operative nausea vomit overall earlier return pre-anesthetic functional state . At low dos , propofol may also use maintain level sedation radiological imaging endoscopic investigation . While propofol provide many advantage cause significant respiratory depression . Adverse respiratory event report similar adult child . Propofol induce respiratory depression may lead hypoxemia require provision supplemental oxygen mask and/or manual positive pressure ventilation.8 Artificial ventilation require significant expertise poorly manage may result gastric insufflation , pulmonary aspiration hypoxia , lead devastate complication permanent brain injury death . The maximum dose rate administration propofol cause respiratory depression child yet accurately define . Age specific effect also report . Objectives Primary aim : •Develop safe dose schedule propofol administration child ensure spontaneous ventilation maintain least 95 % subject . Secondary aim : •Model effect propofol induction administer intravenous infusion facilitate prediction dose schedule different dos , different end-points different clinical scenario . Research Method Prospective randomize study . Subjects randomly assign receive predetermine infusion rate propofol induction sedation . Statistical Analysis A graphical representation data point crossover produce . Data analyse per protocol basis use pooled-adjacent-violators algorithm estimate maximal infusion rate whilst preserve spontaneous ventilation . We apply boot-strap method implement Pace compute 95 % confidence limit . The effect age , assess perform separate analysis age-strata . To model ventilatory effect propofol , develop mathematical model human respiratory control . We base respiratory model propose Ursino ( Ursino Model ) 19-21 three compartment model comprise lung , brain tissue gas exchange . We enhance model include ventilatory regulation , along pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic model propofol include respiratory effect site . The identification suitable parameter model include non-linear fitting clinical data ( age , weight , BSA , ventilatory volume , CO2 excretion , respiratory rate , entropy ) .</detailed_description>
