	<brief_summary>1.1 To detect reproducible variation serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level throughout course one year relationship objectively measure level ultraviolet exposure . 1.2 To determine specific time within year would yield significant data could focus future , large study examine whether protective effect serum vitamin D development cutaneous melanoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Response Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Incidental Ultraviolet Light Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conduct pilot study investigate ability generate dose-response curve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D incidental ultraviolet light exposure measure objectively computerized personal ultraviolet light radiation dosimeter among 10 healthy volunteer New Mexico population highly expose solar UV radiation . During follow-up period collect solar exposure data self-reported sun exposure diary , tandem objective UV dosimeter data , collect blood sample serum measurement . We carry clinical measurement serum vitamin D , parathyroid hormone , calcium phosphorus ion . We analyze correlation vitamin D record UV exposure order evaluate physiological change due solar exposure . This pilot study important melanoma prevention currently confusion among public much sun need vitamin D production much sun exposure increase risk develop melanoma . Expected benefit study participant include obtain objective measure daily ultraviolet exposure vitamin D status possible need supplementation . Expected benefit society include determine dose-response vitamin D ultraviolet light enhance understanding balance necessary harmful ultraviolet exposure . The result generate pilot study could provide scientific basis design large study develop effective primary prevention cutaneous malignant melanoma . This pilot study investigate ability generate dose-response curve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D incidental ultraviolet light exposure measure objectively computerized personal UVR dosimeter . The knowledge obtain provide important pilot data large NIH grant estimate risk-benefit solar exposure serum vitamin D development prevention cutaneous melanoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Lightskinned volunteer ( Caucasians include Hispanics slightly dark complexion ) 2 . 18 year age ( 5 men 5 woman ) 3 . Resident State New Mexico 4 . Indoor worker significant history prolong , excessive sun exposure 5 . Willing monthly blood draw 6 . Willing fill sun diary every day different indoor/outdoor activity . 7 . During project time period potential pregnancy woman volunteer would change risk category participant , reportable event UNM HSC HRRC Clinical Trial Office . Further explanation inclusion criterion : This pilot study intend evaluate doseresponse association measure UV exposure individual serum 25 ( OH ) vitamin D level . To date , little data great deal misinformation vitamin D. Caucasians variety skin type melanin production . This pilot study unfunded know extreme heterogeneity among Caucasians absorption UVB subsequent synthesis vitamin D. Among volunteer 2 participant Hispanic ethnicity represent well . Darkerskinned individual , African Americans , produce considerably less vitamin D , base bone health literature . Inclusion African Americans critical future develop understanding relationship vitamin D UV exposure . Our collaborator , Elizabeth Jacobs University Arizona , currently conduct pilot study evaluate UV serum vitamin D among individual darker pigmentation . The motivation pilot study balance vitamin D sun exposure riskbenefit assessment development melanoma . Asians African Americans develop melanoma , rate ten time less Caucasians appear relate sun exposure ; thus , include time would allow u focus medicallyrelated issue . 1 . Diet high oily fish ( e.g . eat cod liver sardine oil conserve product 23 times/week ) 2 . Oral vitamin D supplementation ( 1,000 IU/day amount ) 3 . Tanning bed use . 4 . Existing pregnancy</criteria>
