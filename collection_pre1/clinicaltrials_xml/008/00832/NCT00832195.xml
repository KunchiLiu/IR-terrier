	<detailed_description>The propose study non-blinded prospective randomize cohort design . Subjects include adult runner gender history injury 6 month prior study enrollment . Eligible participant history surgery trauma low extremity might compromise walk run gait , subject must able comfortably fit select footwear . Three different foot posture sub-group classification recruit : neutral , mild moderate , excessive . The subject ' foot posture classify use Foot Posture Index ( Redmond et al . ( 2006 ) ( 1 ) . Twenty four subject estimate require within foot posture sub-group ; therefore 72 subject goal enrollment . Subjects within foot posture sub-group randomized one two separate footwear condition : neutral group mild moderate pronator group divide receive either neutral cushion run shoe ( a.k.a . 'neutral shoe ' ) , shoe mild stability component control overpronation ( a.k.a . 'stability shoe ' ) ; participant excessive pronator sub-group randomize receive either 'stability shoe ' shoe aggressive motion control feature ( a.k.a . 'motion control shoe ' ) . All subject undergo initial baseline test , include entrance interview participant eligibility , train history , run injury history documentation low extremity anthropometry ( i.e . arch height , knee alignment , stand rearfoot position ) . Subjects randomize baseline test shoe condition receive shoe , train diary run programme time . Once subject complete baseline testing , official run clinic start date commence follow Saturday . A run clinic establish subject chance meet together , along knowledgeable run leader study co-investigator ( MR ) , order increase group cohesion provide opportunity data monitoring , programme feedback subject question . All subject begin run programme official run clinic start date . The programme design prepare individual half-marathon ( 21 kilometre ) run event 13 week . Subjects run time , indicate run programme , rest week meeting follow Saturday . This schedule repeat entire 13 week duration programme . Outcome variables interest study include : 1 ) number injury event , define miss run workout associate run related pain ; 2 ) McGill Pain Questionnaire score ( 2 ) ; 3 ) Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) item pain rest , activity daily live , immediately run , respectively ( 3 ) . Outcome variable assess baseline , 6 week point run programme , conclusion run programme . All data enter spreadsheet statistical analysis software package JMP Version 4.0.0 ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC ) . In calculate statistical power subject recruitment , 20 % difference VAS pain score across group consider clinically meaningful difference . Accordingly , assume standard deviation 2.3 VAS score , alpha 5 % beta error-level 10 % , twenty four subject require within foot posture sub-group ; therefore 69 subject goal enrollment . Each foot posture sub-group undergo analysis procedure . Levene 's test equality variance precede factorial analysis variance determine whether significant main effect time footwear condition , well interaction effect , three dependent ( outcome ) variable .
