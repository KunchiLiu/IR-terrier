	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study Human Intestinal Microbiome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study describe intestinal microbiomes cohort healthy adult subject 6-month period time . Many question human microbiota exist . Previous study show difference among individual great difference among different sample site single individual . Up 60 healthy adult subject , age 18-45 year , Baltimore University Maryland Baltimore community recruit screened document health status . A brief medical history , include recent travel antibiotic use , record . Subjects provide stool specimen genomic analysis intestinal microbiome 6-month period follow interval : Day 0 , Week 1 , Week 2 , Week 3 , Week 4 , Week 8 , Week 12 , Week 13 , Week 14 , Week 15 , Week 16 , Week 20 , Week 24 . At Week 12 , subject receive 3-day course oral Ciprofloxacin 500 mg every12 hour . Weekly stool specimen obtain begin first day antibiotic use 4 Weeks thereafter . Then monthly specimen stool site resume Week 16 . The primary objective define human intestinal microbiome healthy adult longitudinal fashion . The secondary objective define re-colonization intestine treatment broad-spectrum antibiotic use comprehensive genomic technique . Each subject participate study 7 month .</detailed_description>
