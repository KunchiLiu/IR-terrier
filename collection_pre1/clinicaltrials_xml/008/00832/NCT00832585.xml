	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis chronic inflammatory skin disease associate cutaneous hyper-reactivity environmental trigger generally innocuous healthy , nonatopic individual ( Leung et al . 2004 ) . Acute eczematous skin lesion atopic dermatitis characterize mark epidermal intercellular edema ( spongiosis ) . Chronic lesion characterize acanthotic epidermis elongation rete ridge , parakeratosis , minimal spongiosis ( Leung Bieber 2003 ) . A significant mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate present acute chronic skin lesion , consist lymphocyte , immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) -bearing Langerhans cell , inflammatory dendritic epidermal cell , macrophage . Eosinophils also present varying level ( Leung Bieber 2003 ) . Activation skin-selective home peripheral blood T lymphocytes subsequent effector function skin represent sequential immunologic event pathogenesis atopic dermatitis ( Akdis et al . 2000 ) . More 90 % skin-infiltrating T lymphocytes inflammatory skin disease atopic dermatitis express CD44- oligosaccharide determinant cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen ( CLA ) ( Berg et al . 1991 ) . The migration CD4+ , CLA-positive T lymphocytes across cytokine-activated endothelial cell layer 2 show dependent interaction lymphocyte function-associated antigen ( LFA ) -1 intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) -1 ( Santamaria Babi et al . 1995 ) . The activation T lymphocytes play important role atopic dermatitis pathogenesis . In acute atopic dermatitis , T-helper ( TH ) 2 cytokine profile predominantly see , increased expression interleukin ( IL ) -4 , lL-5 , IL-13 ( Stone 2003 ) . In chronic atopic dermatitis , cytokine profile change TH1 predominant profile , increased expression interferon ( IFN-y ) ( Leung et al . 2004 ) . Activated T lymphocytes also responsible direct cell-mediated keratinocyte apoptosis , contribute spongiosis pattern epidermal injury characteristic acute atopic dermatitis ( Trautmann et al . 2001 ) , The interaction T lymphocytes antigen-presenting cell ( APCs ) one initial step T lymphocyte activation immunologic response perceive immune system foreign antigen . Although much attention focus primary interaction T lymphocyte receptor major histocompatability complex ( MHC ) -antigen complex APC , several cell surface component also involve , necessary , T lymphocyte activation . Ligand pair necessary T lymphocyte activation , locate cell surface T lymphocytes APC , respectively , include CD2/LFA-3 , LFA-1/ICAM-1 ( also ICAM-2 ICAM-3 ) , CD281B7 , CD4/MHC Class II , CD8/MHC Class I. CD2 interaction LFA.-3 necessary T lymphocyte activation , binding , T-helper cell response . ( Fischer et al . 1986 ; Springer et al . 1987 ) Anievive速 ( Alefacept ) dimeric fusion protein consist extracellular CD2 bind portion human leukocyte function antigen -3 ( LFA-3 ) link Fc portion IgG1 . Amevive速 interfere lymphocyte activation specifically bind CD2 lymphocytes thereby inhibiting LFA-3/CD2 interaction . Amevive速 cause reduction CD4+ lymphocytes play role atopic dermatitis . Currently , Amevive速 show safe effective agent treatment psoriasis may prove useful treat atopic dermatitis . Unlike `` biologics '' treatment skin disease , use alefacept associate increased infection , congestive heart failure , demyelinate disorder lupus- like syndrome . ( 1-Lodak David , 2004 ) Ten atopic patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol study .</detailed_description>
