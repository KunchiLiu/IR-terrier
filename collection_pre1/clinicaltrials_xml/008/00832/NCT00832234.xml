	<detailed_description>Title : Phase II Study Combination Bortezomib ( VELCADE , PS-341 ) , Dexamethasone , Rituximab ( MabThera ) ( BDR ) Patients previously untreated Waldenstroms Macroglobulinemia ( WM ) . Objectives : The primary objective study : - To determine response rate [ combine complete response ( CR ) + partial response ( PR ) + minimal response ( MR ) ] follow treatment BDR patient previously untreated WM . Secondary objective : - To determine time progression follow treatment BDR . - To assess safety tolerability BDR patient WM . Patient population : Patients previously untreated WM indication treatment candidate study . Specific inclusion exclusion criterion detail protocol . Number patient : Sixty-one patient enrol multicenter study . This study conduct within center participate European Myeloma Network . Study design methodology This Phase II multicenter study design evaluate safety efficacy combination BDR . BDR administer one 21-day treatment cycle follow four 35-day treatment cycle patient WM . Bortezomib administer iv push 3 5 second dose 1.3mg/m2/day day 1,4,8 11 cycle 1 . On cycle 2-5 bortezomib give dose 1.6mg/m2/day day 1,8,15 22 cycle . Only cycle 2 5 , follow administration Bortezomib , dexamethasone 40mg iv Rituximab 375 mg/m2 iv administer . A total 8 infusion rituximab administer . Subsequently patient rat CR , PR , MR SD follow without treatment evidence progressive disease . A Screening visit conduct within 28 day baseline ( baseline Day 1 , Cycle 1 , study drug administration ) . At visit , medical history obtain complete physical examination perform include vital sign , height , weight , 12-lead electrocardiogram . A neurological questionnaire also complete . Disease assessment perform , include performance status , bone marrow aspirate biopsy , Beta2-microglobulin , serum protein electrophoresis quantification immunoglobulins immunofixation study , CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis . Clinical laboratory test include complete blood count plus differential , electrolyte , urea , creatinine , total bilirubin , SGOT ( ALT ) , SGPT ( AST ) , LDH , total protein albumin . Patients meet eligibility requirement assess Screening visit enrol study start study drug treatment . Patients evaluated cycle serum protein electrophoresis determine response therapy . If patient demonstrate response stable disease end cycle continue receive therapy . If patient demonstrate evidence progressive disease end cycle patient remove study . Modified response criterion updated Third International Workshop Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia use assess response , stable disease ( SD ) , progressive disease ( PD ) study . Changes serum monoclonal protein concentration assess serum protein electrophoresis rather nephelometric measurement serum immunoglobulin . Patients receive five cycle therapy . Subsequently , strongly advise blood stem cell collect patient &lt; 70 year age future high-dose therapy . At end cycle patient test performed assess toxicity efficacy . A directed questionnaire neurologic toxicity , review concomitant medication support therapy , include growth factor transfusion also perform . Three month last dose study drug , every three month thereafter 2 year , patient attend follow-up study visit . At visit , physical examination perform Karnofsky performance status assess . Patients neurological questionnaire complete , test disease assessment include serum protein electrophoresis quantification immunoglobulins immunofixation study , Beta2-microglobulin , bone marrow aspirate biopsy ( patient complete remission ) , CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis ( patient evidence WM disease baseline scan ) . Serum protein electrophoresis quantification immunoglobulins immunofixation study must repeat &gt; 6 week patient attains complete response . At follow-up study visit , complete blood count plus differential , electrolyte , urea , creatinine , total bilirubin , SGOT , also obtain .</detailed_description>
