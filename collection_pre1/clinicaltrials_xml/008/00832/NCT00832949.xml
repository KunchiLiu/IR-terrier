III . Methodology To explore objective , perspective individual arthritis examine use qualitative approach . One one semi-structured interview utilized component study . Semi-structured Interviews Study Design Semi-structured interview conduct individual inflammatory arthritis act key informant . An interview guide ( Appendix A ) develop purpose study base literature review cultural need patient education arthritis , previous study peer support need arthritis patient discussion colleague . The interviewer ask specific question interview . The order question may alter probe incorporate obtain information . Probes , prompt , question include interview guide , allow participant elaborate response provide discussion . Probes pose neutral manner . Depending data emerges , additional question add interview guide obtain information subsequent interview . Data collection continue interview conduct key informant . There approximately 10-15 interview . The interview anticipate last approximately one hour , conduct second year medical student co-investigator study . Subjects Individuals identify participation study base follow inclusion criterion : - Participants must diagnosis inflammatory arthritis physician ; - Participants must age 18 year old ; - Participants must able participate 1 hour interview ; - Participants English-speaking - Participants immigrants Canada Recruitment Consent Process The individual identify cohort patient inflammatory arthritis rheumatology clinic Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre The Principal Investigator identify screen potential research participant inflammatory arthritis patient population accord eligibility criterion study initiate inform consent process . The Principal Investigator introduce project review information letter study eligible patient ensure potential participant understands study he/she ask answer question potential participant may study ( Appendix B ) . The PI obtain verbal consent medical student co-investigator contact potential research participant . When individual agree meet medical student co-investigator , his/her name forward Office Manager clinic . The Office Manager contact individual schedule interview PI 's rheumatology clinic office medical student co-investigator assign project . A confirmation letter ( Appendix C ) time location interview mail participant Office Manager . The day interview schedule take place medical student telephone individual remind him/her time location interview ( Appendix D ) . At begin interview , prior ask question , medical student review consent form ( Appendix E ) potential research participant ensure he/she understands study he/she ask answer question person may . Once write consent obtain , copy provide participant . Interviews conduct face-to-face . These interview take place time convenient participant private room Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre . Interviews tape record use digital tape recorder . Transcription interview may occur whole part . The medical student take write note , interview . These include student 's thought interview , description nonverbal communication participant , conversation may audio-taped interview . Personal professional relationship interviewer participant anticipate . IV . Data Analysis Interview data analyse use constant comparative method analysis . Interview data categorize theme analyse medical student conduct interview . The transcript also cod study coordinator and/or second medical student , assist analysis . A preliminary coding scheme develop team , first code interview separately use cod scheme meet compare contrast code . The initial interview guide may modify subsequent interview include new theme probe emerge interview . Codes add cod scheme new concept identify interview progress . V. Risks Benefits There potential risk emotional distress patient ask illness . Should occur , study team work provide resource support . Participants may withdraw study time without negative consequence . Indirect benefit may experience due improvement peer support network arthritis patient gain knowledge culture influence peer support need patient arthritis . VI . Privacy Confidentiality Only medical student , research staff Principal Investigator involve study know identity key informant . No identify information use data collection form . For form , participant assign unique identifying number . The list name , address phone number keep password protect computer file secure server lock research room access Principal Investigator , research staff medical student work study . All information obtain study hold strict confidence . No names identify information use publication presentation . No information identify participant transfer outside researcher study hospital . All digital file record interview store password protect computer file secure server lock research room delete 25 year follow completion study . VII . Compensation No monetary remuneration provide .
