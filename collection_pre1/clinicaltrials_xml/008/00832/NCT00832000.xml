	<brief_summary>Nondystrophic myotonia ( NDM ) neuromuscular disorder cause genetic abnormality certain muscle cell membrane protein . The protein affect muscle contraction . Individuals NDM experience limit muscle relaxation , cause pain , weakness , incoordination , impaired physical activity function . Because NDM rare , information best way treat people disorder lack , FDA-approved therapy . The purpose study determine effectiveness medication mexiletine treat people NDM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Mexiletine Treating People With Non-Dystrophic Myotonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NDM neuromuscular disorder cause mutation skeletal muscle ion channel , usually voltage-dependent sodium chloride channel . The poorly functioning channel result impaired muscle relaxation contraction , also call myotonia . Mexiletine antiarrhythmic medication high affinity muscle sodium channel may ability correct delay inactivation sodium channel . In case report single-blind clinical trial , mexiletine show reduce symptom myotonia . Currently , standard strategy treat people NDM , effective treatment option need . This study determine effectiveness mexiletine treat people NDM . Participation study last 9 week involve two separate 4-week treatment period , 1-week washout period . During first treatment period , participant randomly assign receive either mexiletine placebo , take three time day . This follow 1 week treatment . During second treatment period , participant receive whichever treatment receive initially follow dose schedule . Participants attend five study visit occur screen Weeks 0 , 4 , 5 , 9 . Screening include blood urine sampling , electrocardiography ( EKG ) , medical history . The remain visit include physical examination , grip test , exercise test , nerve conduction test , blood sampling , questionnaire , electromyography ( EMG ) . EKG repeat Weeks 4 , 5 , 9 . Throughout study , participant phone daily report symptom . There follow-up visit . Funded FDAOPD RO1 0003454 .</detailed_description>
