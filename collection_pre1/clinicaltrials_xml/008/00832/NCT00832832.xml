	<detailed_description>- Abstract - Eye drop low intraocular pressure ( IOP ) remain principal therapy glaucoma . The path write prescription IOP-lowering drop optimal lower IOP prevent development worsen glaucoma many step . One critical step maximize amount drug eye drop reach target tissue eye eye drop ocular surface . The literature support conclusion eyelid closure ( EC ) and/or nasolacrimal occlusion ( NLO ) increase effect IOP , decrease frequency dosing , decrease blood level . They increase contact time apply drug ocular surface , decrease amount drug pass nasolacrimal duct nasopharynx . - Fifteen year ago landmark study perform pilocarpine timolol . In retrospect , principal limitation study empirically study one duration ( 5 minute ) EC NLO , include ( n't yet invent ) commonly use eye drop low IOP , prostaglandins . The limitation 5 minute duration may impractical many patient decrease adherence due inconvenience . - My research hypothesis EC use conjunction prostaglandin eye drop administration result great IOP lower 1 minute EC may effective 5 minute . - The research potentially great clinical importance . Pharmaceutical company invest heavily develop market eye drop may 1 mm Hg effective competitor . If similar great improvement make simple patient action , patient care improve - Objectives ( include primary secondary objective ) - To determine EC increase IOP lower effect prostaglandin eye drop . - To determine relative effectiveness EC 1 5 minute duration . - Study Procedures - Controlled clinical trial , use one eye subject experimental eye ( EC plus drug ) control ( drug alone ) . Half patient perform EC 1 minute ; half 5 minute . - Subjects recruit glaucoma practice Johns Hopkins Hospital Wilmer Greenspring Station . Eligibility ( see 5 ) assess regularly schedule visit . Participants sign consent form schedule 3 study visit , none part routine clinical care . The subject instruct NOT use his/her prostaglandin eye drop day precede study visit 1 . - Study visit 1-day 1 The subject instruct study coordinator eyelid closure . The IOP measure 3 time one 5 minute period 7:30 10 use Goldmann applanation tonometry median IOP record ( baseline IOP ) . The subject randomized performing eyelid closure right leave eye either 1 5 minute . Based randomization , study coordinator instill one drop prostaglandin eye drop ( latanoprost , travoprost , bimatoprost ) patient normally use appropriate eye , observe subject perform eyelid closure choose eye either 1 5 minute . One hour later , IOP measure 3 time individual mask eye EC median IOP record ( 1 hour IOP ) . The patient instruct NOT use his/her prostaglandin eye drop night appointment follow morning schedule . - Study visit 2-day 2 The IOP measure 3 time one 5 minute period 7:30 10 use Goldmann applanation tonometry individual mask eye EC , median IOP record ( 24 hour IOP ) . The subject instruct resume his/her prostaglandin evening instruct continue EC home select eye designate amount time ( 1 5 minute ) third study visit . - Study visit 3-between day 8 15 The IOP measure 3 time 7:30 10 use Goldmann applanation tonometry , individual mask eye EC , median IOP record ( 1 week IOP ) . - Study duration number study visit require research participant . - The total duration study 1-2 week - Blinding , include justification blind blind trial , applicable . - Subjects mask . Masking IOP measurer essential avoid bias - Justification participant receive routine care current therapy stop . - Subjects continue routine care throughout study . - Justification inclusion placebo non-treatment group . - There placebo group . - Definition treatment failure participant removal criterion . - Participants remove unable perform EC desire leave study - Description happen participant receive therapy study end participant 's participation study end prematurely . - All subject continue therapy already take enter study - Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria - Inclusion - Patient must use one three topical prostaglandin ( latanop rost , travaprost , bimatoprost ) , IOP lower eye drop least one month . - Exclusion -Previous laser incisional surgery glaucoma . Use punctual plug Abnormal slit lamp exam ( except cataract intraocular lens implant ) . No incisional eye surgery least 6 month .</detailed_description>
