	<brief_summary>Several large trial show beta-blocker treatment reduces risk death hospital admission patient symptomatic heart failure . Unfortunately , survey data suggest relatively poor utilisation beta-blockers , despite ample evidence good tolerability . Additionally several important unanswered question , clinical efficacy specific sub-populations ( woman , elderly patient diabetes co-morbidities ) effect beta-blockers combination medication . Previous meta-analyses , base publish tabular data , conduct although approach important bias limitation . We plan perform carefully conduct systematic review individual patient data major randomised trial beta-blockers heart failure . The goal collaborative project clarify overall efficacy beta-blockers identify sub-groups show particular benefit , thereby increase use beta-blockers , reduce adverse clinical outcome high cost associate condition .</brief_summary>
