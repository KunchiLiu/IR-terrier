	<detailed_description>Principal Investigator : Peter Kozuch , M.D . Sites : BIMC/SLRHC Introduction A Phase II open- label , prospective study determine efficacy pre-operative chemotherapy six cycle modify FOLFOX 6 follow total mesorectal excision ( TME ) follow additional six cycle FOLFOX 6 . The objective study follow : 1 . The primary endpoint trial pathologic complete response ( response rate ) . 2 . Secondary endpoint include observation overall pathologic response rate , correlation pathologic stag pre-operative ultrasound pelvic MRI staging , well observation toxic side effect , pattern disease relapse , disease-free survival outcome overall survival outcome . Background Locally advance rectal carcinoma continue major oncologic problem United States . Several landmark study lead current standard approach care patient stage II III rectal cancer . In 1990 adjuvant 5- fluorouracil base chemoradiation become accepted standard care basis two randomized trial . During follow two decade significant modification make administration chemoradiation therapy surgery . First , continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil daily concurrent radiation show superior bolus 5-fluorouracil 3 consecutive day week 1 5 radiation . The overall rate tumor relapse fell 47 % 37 % , distant metastasis rate fell 40 % 31 % . Notably , local tumor recurrence significantly different two chemotherapy schedule . The improvement relapse rate translate 4 year survival benefit , 70 % versus 60 % , favor protract venous infusion 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . What known , however , relative contribution radiation therapy survival outcome set chemotherapy program rectal cancer . Optimization systemic therapy appear significant impact survival outcome . Firstly , patient may begin full systemic therapy regimen currently identify effective adjuvant treatment stage III colon cancer . This relatively prompt initiation 'full systemic dose ' chemotherapy stark contrast typical paradigm 3-4 week interval initial consultation initiation chemoradiation . Another theoretical advantage propose trial lie fact full systemic therapy relatively uninterrupted . Therefore , anticipate 6-8 week perioperative treatment free interval anticipate schema compare favorably typical 10-12 week perioperative treatment free interval current standard care neoadjuvant chemoradiation . Another important consideration favor chemotherapy substantially less travel time/treatment time patient favorable toxicity profile give elimination daily neoadjuvant radiation . Treatment Plan Patients give : - Modified FOLFOX6 give neoadjuvantly prior resection 3 month ( 6 cycle ) - Modified FOLFOX6 give adjuvantly within 6 week follow resection 3 month ( 6 cycle )</detailed_description>
