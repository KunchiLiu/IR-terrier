	<brief_title>Trial Using Docetaxel Cytoxan Breast Cancers With High Recurrence Scores</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study show chemotherapy effect treat breast cancer whether receive surgery . Receiving chemotherapy surgery , rather surgery , may allow less extensive surgery shrink size cancer . The purpose study ass docetaxel cytoxan shrink size breast tumor allow preserve breast less extensive surgery breast . Additionally , receive chemotherapy surgery , able determine cancer responsive chemotherapy . Prior enter study , special test , call Oncotype DX assay , perform small amount cancer biopsy time diagnose breast cancer , determine likelihood cancer benefit shrink chemotherapy . You eligible enter study recurrence score determine use Oncotype DX assay 25 great . Patients hormone receptor-positive breast cancer recurrence score great equal 25 previously demonstrate obtain significant benefit chemotherapy give surgery . In addition , researcher would like examine protein present blood protein present breast tissue . These additional part study voluntary NOT require participate study .</detailed_description>
