	<brief_summary>In study treatment full thickness burn wound culture autologous keratinocytes combination mesh split skin autograft versus mesh split skin graft alone compare . It expect application culture autologous keratinocytes combination mesh split skin autograft improve wound heal scar formation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Application Cultured Autologous Keratinocytes Burn Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment extensive burn wound transplantation mesh split skin graft . Disadvantages treatment heal large full thickness burn wound still accompany scar formation . Even standard treatment , transplantation ( mesh ) split skin autograft , result satisfactory functional cosmetic appearance heal wound . Due limit available donor site mesh need enlarge . Bigger enlargements mesh give scar mesh pattern still visible scar , probably wound closure still need several week . Application culture autologous keratinocytes may enhance wound closure improve outcome healing . Primary objective : Does application culture autologous keratinocytes deep burn wound accelerate wound closure Secondary objective : Does application culture autologous keratinocytes deep burn wound improve scar quality respect scar elasticity , colour/pigmentation and/or smoothness 3 12 month .</detailed_description>
