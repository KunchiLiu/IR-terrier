	<detailed_description>In North America , ureteroscopic-guided lithotripsy holmium : yttrium-aluminum-garnet ( Ho : YAG ) laser increase clinical utility owe capacity fragment stone composition . However , application light energy , retropulsion stone possible due combine effect fragment ejection , water vaporization , cavitation bubble expansion collapse . Reducing laser energy use laser fiber small diameter option address consequence , change potential reduce efficacy laser treatment . Movement stone stone fragment laser lithotripsy also cause application irrigation procedure . Irrigation necessary order maintain clear visualization target stone lithotripsy , yet irrigation flow pressure push stone away laser tip , require reposition laser , , presence hydrodilation ureter , cause stone float renal pelvis kidney . In situation physician may require use specialized instrument , add complexity cost procedure . As result , physician monitor irrigation closely reduce flow retropulsion stone fragment occur . Retropulsion stone stone fragment laser lithotripsy report 24 % patient cause prolonged operative time due near-constant reposition laser fiber firing , well result additional treatment method , make available flexible ureteroscope , associate cost , additional cost associate extended procedure . A novel occluding guidewire , Accordion Stone Management Device , develop advanced ureter past stone . Once past stone , occlusion film engage within lumen ureter order limit retropulsion stone fragment , irrespective laser energy , flow rate irrigation , dilation ureter . Reduction stone fragment movement potential reduce operative time increase stone-free rate within population .</detailed_description>
