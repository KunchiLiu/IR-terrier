	<brief_title>Trimodal Lung-Sparing Treatment Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current surgical and/or chemotherapeutic approach malignant pleural mesothelioma unsatisfactory show significantly prolong survival , often lead worsen pulmonary function quality life . We investigate whether prospective trial trimodal ( surgery , pleural chemotherapy , pleural radiation ) therapy improve overall 1 year survival patient malignant pleural mesothelioma . The propose treatment include exploratory thoracoscopy , placement Mediport catheters pleural space , intraoperative chemotherapy , repeat intraperitoneal chemotherapy , intrapleural instillation radioactive P32 radiate pleural surface . In addition , study randomize , half patient receive additional three intravenous systemic chemotherapy treatment cisplatin pemetrexed ( Alimta ) tandem intrapleural chemotherapy ( week 3 , 6 , 9 ) . The potential significance research treatment may render less necessary surgically remove affected lung whole part , order achieve significant disease cytoreduction . We hope alter currently accept paradigm major lung surgery inescapable component treatment , advance concept combination judicious preparative surgery , systemic chemotherapy , locoregional drug treatment pleural surface may offer best hope prolongation survival intact lung function .</detailed_description>
