	<detailed_description>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) prevalent condition increasingly diagnose adult population consider independent risk factor development cardiovascular disease . More specifically , OSA link thrombosis , formation clot blood vessel lead heart attack stroke . A good understanding mechanism associate thrombosis development cardiovascular disease patient obstructive sleep apnea need . This research investigate function enzyme adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) subject sleep disorder . ADA responsible metabolizing adenosine , neuromodulator release period sleep apnea find promote vascular thrombosis . There multiple type ADA genetically determine different level function . Those different form enzyme may determine group susceptible development thrombosis . Given known association sleep apnea thrombosis , study determine polymorphism enzyme differentially find subject sleep apnea compare sleep disturbance . A total 60 subject present evaluation sleep disorder Weill Cornell Pulmonary Associates Cornell Center Sleep Medicine practice offer participation study . The subject sleep apnea ethnically match subject sleep disorder sleep apnea ( control ) . Once write informed consent obtain Principal Investigator , venipuncture perform office train phlebotomist . A total 15 ml ( approximately 1 tablespoon ) blood collect . The patient monitor ten minute follow blood draw ensure adequate hemostasis . The blood sample utilized DNA sequence determination adenosine deaminase genotype phenotype . Information clinically indicate overnight sleep study perform within 6 month ( prior ) visit use categorize subject group ( sleep apnea vs. sleep disorder sleep apnea ) .</detailed_description>
