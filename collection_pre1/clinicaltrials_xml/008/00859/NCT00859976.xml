	<brief_summary>The randomise control trial carry patient require total hip replacement ( THR ) reduce pain restore function . One way fix hip joint bone coat implant encourage body grow bone onto replacement hip . This study aim find whether new ( Bonemaster ) coat allows increase bony growth onto cup compare usual ( plasma-sprayed ) coating . This may reduce incidence early failure due poor bony attachment , well know complication early failure total hip replacement . The study compare two different type coat ( BoneMaster Plasma-sprayed ) cup replacement hip . Density bone immediately surround cup observe see difference two group . The density bone measure use standard x−ray assessment small sample 14 patient , use special scan call Dual Energy X−ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA Scan ) . Functional comparison assess clinical score .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient identify orthopaedic surgeon orthopaedic clinic deem suitable study inclusion exclusion criterion meet . 210 patient recruit study patient randomise either group allow 105 patient group . Patients follow 6 month , 1 year 2 year surgery . All patient radiographic assessment follow-up interval , well Harris Hip , Oxford Hip Womac score . This allow comparison two group . The BoneMaster coat extensively test cell animal study evaluate one previous clinical study show favorable result . Further investigation require ensure new coating may enhance bony growth allow good fixation hip early period operation also longer period time . The growth need measure use sensitive scan radiographic assessment alone , call DEXA also use previous study .</detailed_description>
