	<brief_title>Monthly SOM230C Recurrent Progressive Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To enroll study , sample participant 's tumor tissue , store earlier study , must send lab Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center diagnosis special testing . - Prior start study medication , participant undergo Octreotide scan . This special type scan use obtain information certain tumor . - Participants receive study medication , SOM230C , via injection buttock every 28 day . Therefore , treatment cycle last 28 day . - The following test procedures do prior first , second third treatment cycle , every three treatment cycle thereafter : Complete physical examination include neurological exam ; vital sign ; current medication symptom review ; blood sample pregnancy test ( woman child-bearing potential ) . - About 2/3 first treatment cycle ( around day 22 ) , participant visit research doctor complete physical examination include neurological exam blood work . - Participants ECGs do prior first treatment cycle , 2/3 first third treatment cycle ( around day 22 ) , prior sixth treatment cycle , every three treatment cycle thereafter .</detailed_description>
