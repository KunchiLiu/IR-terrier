	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea common sleep disorder characterize temporary stop breathe sleep associate development cardiovascular disease . This research investigate one potential mechanism lead development cardiovascular disorder , specifically , blockage blood vessel call `` vascular occlusion '' , subject sleep apnea . A group healthy control use comparison . All subject undergo clinical evaluation follow overnight sleep study morning blood draw . Subjects sleep apnea treat accord standard clinical management follow research protocol one month . At end one month , repeat blood draw perform sleep apnea subject comparative analysis . If control subject find abnormality research study , refer clinical evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The importance project investigate mechanism vascular disease sleep apnea determine pathways intervention , aim prevent development cardiovascular disease individual . This propose research aim evaluate NTPDase activity lymphocytes level circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) patient intermittent hypoxemia ( IH ) due obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) healthy control . This original approach define mechanism underlie high incidence occlusive vascular event patient OSA . The evaluation pathophysiological mechanism lead good understanding pathway involve development therapeutic strategy target reduction avoidance endothelial injury ultimate goal reduce morbidity mortality associate pathologic event sleep apnea . The standard care use protocol , involve use CPAP ( continuous positive airway pressure ) treat sleep apnea .</detailed_description>
