	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety monochromatic phototherapy ( Biolight® ) foot ulcer diabetic patient , comparison placebo phototherapy complementary standard diabetic foot ulcer therapy . The study initiate four week long Run In Period eliminate spontaneous heal ulcer include . Treatment monochromatic phototherapy ( Biolight® placebo ) give locally , additional standard care , three time weekly first four week twice weekly follow sixteen week ulcer completely heal , accord pre-determined treatment plan . The area ulcer measure weekly 20 week ulcer completely heal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Description Biolight® Therapy device The therapy work apply , indication , specific combination pulsate monochromatic light specific area body . The therapy non-invasive , non-thermal , base effect pulse monochromatic light visible near-visible spectrum . The Biolight® Therapy - mechanism action Light pre-requisite living organism , human learnt use light many different situation , least health care , light widely use various therapeutic context every day . X-ray used investigational tool . In treat skin disease , psoriasis , use UV radiation . Laser successful , surgery pain relief , white light treatment recommend seasonal depression Light fact electromagnetic radiation use various wavelength . These wavelength perceive different colour . Red violet light consist long shorter wavelength respectively . Light consist wavelength perceive white . There electromagnetic field light contain energy , use different treatment situation . In heal process wound tissue basal component need access energy oxygen . If amount energy insufficient , heal process retard . By use monochromatic light , predetermine energy level specific wavelength , contribute expect amount energy demand . Applied choose pulse frequency carefully calculate period time , wound cell provide energy , increase activity well oxygen supply damage area . That may promote fast healing . The Biolight Therapy suggest shorten treatment time reduce treatment cost improve quality life . This non-invasive treatment think complementary traditional therapy . The method simple , painless without know side effect . The Biolight Care Device The Biolight® Care Device CE-marked medical device certify accordance Medical Device Directive ( MDD ; 93/42/EEC ) , size palm hand . The device contain 30 diode emit infrared light 956 nm also 80 diode emit red light 637 nm . Infrared red pulsed monochromatic light use unique triple-stepped sequence . Infrared light , irradiance ~55 W/m2 , combine red light , irradiance ~21 W/m2 . Using duty cycle 80 % , infrared red light pulse follow frequency first week : infrared/red 78 Hz , infrared/red 702 Hz , infrared/red 8572,2Hz second week : infrared/red 15,6 Hz , infrared/red 287 Hz , infrared/red124 Hz . The choice pulse frequency wavelength base early observation in-vitro in-vivo study . The equipment monochromatic phototherapy placebo ( irradiance output diode ) identical appearance . Previous study - light therapy Treatment pulse electromagnetic field 40 minute improve micro vascular perfusion skin ( 1 ) . In literature overview 1965 2003 low-laser therapy wound healing , focus vitro model vivo animal human study , study report increase cell proliferation collagen production ; improvement surgical wound heal find rodent model ; , human , beneficial effect superficial wound heal find small case series replicate large study ( 2 ) . In none review study exact mechanism photo thermal , photochemical photomechanical action , report . The precise mode action low-laser therapy wound heal still unknown ( 2 ) . In meta-analytic study 34 peer-reviewed paper efficacy low-power laser tissue repair , positive effect show collagen formation , rate healing , tensile strength , time need wound closure ( 3 ) . In experimental study pressure ulcer mice , significant positive effect show wound heal treatment low-laser therapy effect independent temperature skin surface ( 4 ) . In systematic review effect low-level laser therapy wound heal cell study animal model experiment Lucas et al . ( 5 ) , 36 include study contain 49 outcome parameter , 30 report positive effect laser irradiation 19 . The methodological quality many study poor , in-depth analysis study high methodological quality score show significant pooled effect favour treatment ( 5 ) . A study 20 spinal cord-injured patient 22 pressure ulcer show faster heal combination ultrasound/ultraviolet-C laser treatment , compare nursing care alone ( 6 ) . In prospective , observer-blinded , multicenter randomize clinical study efficacy low-level laser therapy 86 patient stage III decubitus ulcer , evidence find justified use low-level laser therapy ( 7 ) . Previous study - Biolight® A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study pressure ulcer elderly patient show statistically significant difference patient treat monochromatic pulsating light ( Biolight® ) placebo together standard care . This study conduct 163 patient multi-centre study 9 centre Sweden Denmark ( 8 , 9 ) . The mean normalise reduction pressure ulcer size week 12 0.79 phototherapy group 0.50 placebo group ( 95 % CI 0.01-0.53 ; p=0.039 ) . No serious side effect note . The conclusion monochromatic pulsating light fasten heal grade II pressure ulcer elderly patient . A sub group analysis patient diabetic foot ulcer study show strong tendency improve healing ( diff 71.3 % ) . A controlled , randomise , open study effect Biolight® phototherapy comparison conventional treatment 74 patient grade II III chronic pressure ulcer conduct Huddinge hospital ( 10 ) . This study show statistically significant decreased time healing , phototherapy treat group compare control group . A clinical study 26 elderly patient decubitus ulcer show monochromatic phototherapy , Biolight® , effect microcirculation edge decubitus ulcer increase oxygen supply tissue . ( 12 ) . Two in-vitro study growth skin fibroblast cell , use monochromatic phototherapy show two wavelength low high pulse frequency use Biolight® Wound Care program significantly influence skin fibroblast cell growth ( personal communication Kratz &amp; Huss Karolinska Institute , Stockholm , Sweden ) . In animal study ( exposure 5 time week 2-week period ) , similar equipment similar infrared red light exposure present study , adverse effect find ( 11 ) . Study population Diabetic patient foot ulcer randomise active phototherapeutic treatment plus standard care treatment placebo phototherapeutic treatment plus standard care diabetic foot ulcer .</detailed_description>
