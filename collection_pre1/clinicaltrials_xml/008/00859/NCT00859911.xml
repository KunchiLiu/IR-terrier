	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Micronutrient Supplements Growth Educational Achievement Schoolchildren Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomise double blind control cluster trial effectiveness multiple micronutrient supplement give teacher schoolchildren improve growth , nutritional status educational achievement . The primary outcome measure : gain weight height , haemoglobin concentration , cognitive function educational achievement . Secondary outcome anthropometric measurement decrease body arsenic deposit . One hundred school Meherpur District , Bangladesh take part study . Participation basis inform consent . All pupil dewormed twice year use single dose 400 mg albendazole ; promote bioavailability micronutrient supplement . The school randomly allocate two group . In one group 50 school child give teacher single tablet multiple micronutrient every school day week , total 3 day week 125 school day year , depend school national holiday . This supplement make substantial contribution period one year child 's recommended intake iron , iodine , zinc , vitamin A , vitamin B12 , folate four B-group vitamin . Some micronutrient , vitamin A iron , store body , addition meeting current nutritional requirement . Children 50 school receive tablet identical weight , shape , size appearance contain four B-group vitamin multiple micronutrient supplement . The B-group vitamin expect major effect outcome measure , may provide benefit child comparison group . Both supplement formulate accord UK US pharmacopoeias Acme Pharmaceuticals purchase Save Children . Both supplement give free three day week estimate 30,000 pupil 100 study school period two school year . The subject study 30 randomly select child class 2 age range 7 - 8 year 100 school . An equal number boy girl select . The actual number depend enrolment class 2 school . A baseline survey do supplement start measure follow : weight , height anthropometric measurement assess growth ; prevalence intestinal worm infection 20 % sub-sample ; haemoglobin concentration drop blood take finger prick sub-sample 66 % child ; concentration arsenic hair sub-sample 20 % child ; test cognitive function include concentration child ; test educational achievement mathematics language child . These measurement , analyse assessment repeat two year later cohort 1,500 child study group class 4 . The magnitude statistical significance difference mean difference outcome value study group indicate impact multiple micronutrient supplement comparison B-group vitamins alone .</detailed_description>
