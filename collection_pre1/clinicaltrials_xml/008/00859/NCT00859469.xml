	<brief_title>Eloxatin® Plus Gemcitabine Chemotherapy Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin ( ELOXATIN® ) organoplatinum complex exerts cytotoxic effect chiefly inhibition tumoral DNA synthesis repair , lead cellular apoptosis . The antiproliferative activity oxaliplatin show approximate cisplatin carboplatin different tumor type . This phase II clinical trial Oxaliplatin ( ELOXATIN® ) plus gemcitabine first secondline chemotherapy patient malignant pleural peritoneal mesothelioma . This study aim determine objective tumor response rate Oxaliplatin plus gemcitabine give every 14 day patient malignant pleural mesothelioma and/or malignant peritoneal mesothelioma one prior chemotherapy regimen . A total 29 patient expect enrolled study , participation duration 6 month . Patients screen use standard health care assessment test . All test must do within 4 week patient begin treatment . Patients deem eligible start treatment cycle , define interval 14 day , comprise treatment Gemcitabine follow immediately Oxaliplatin . The study drug administer follow manner : Gemcitabine , 1000 mg/m² IV infusion 90 minute , Oxaliplatin , 100 mg/m² IV infusion 2 hour . In absence specific indication discontinuation study drug , patient routinely offer 6 cycle therapy . Further cycle may give opinion investigator patient 's best interest .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm malignant pleural peritoneal mesothelioma epithelial , sarcomatoid , mixed subtype , amenable curative treatment surgery . Patients pleural mesothelioma clinically stag use IMTG TNM stag criterion ( see Protocol Attachment 1 ) . Note stag system peritoneal mesothelioma patient follow survival . Patients may enter base local pathology . Disease status must measurable disease define modify SWOG criterion . Measurable disease : The presence least one measurable lesion . If one lesion present , neoplastic nature disease site confirm histology ( see Section 3.8.1.2 ) . Measurable lesion : Lesions accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥20 mm use conventional technique ≥10 mm use spiral CT scan . At least one level must one rind measurement ≥15 mm . CT ( specifically spiral CT ) scan MRT preferred method measurement . Clinically detected lesion consider measurable superficial ( e.g. , skin nodule palpable lymph node ) . For case skin lesion , documentation color photography , include ruler estimate size lesion require . NOTE : Neither pleural effusion positive bone scan consider measurable . Patients may undergo pleurodesis . If pleurodesis perform , must least 2week delay Oxaliplatin gemcitabine administer . If original CT scan occur prior pleurodesis , additional CT scan require 2 week long pleurodesis , consider baseline scan . NOTE : For patient clinically significant pleural effusion ascites , consideration give drain fluid . Performance status 0 , 1 2 ECOG Performance Status Scale ( palliative measure include pleural drainage occur ) . See Protocol Attachment 2 . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . More one previous regimen systemic chemotherapy . Prior intracavitary cytotoxic drug count prior regimen , unless give purpose pleurodesis . Immunomodulators regard chemotherapy . Prior systemic treatment pemetrexed plus platinum compound contraindication gemcitabineoxaliplatin . Prior radiation therapy target lesion , unless lesion clearly progress interval recent radiation therapy enrollment least 4 week . Active infection ( discretion investigator ) . Pregnancy breast feed . Serious concomitant systemic disorder ( include oncologic emergency ) incompatible study ( discretion investigator ) . Patients `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix register . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy consider physician less 30 % risk relapse . Use investigational agent within 4 week enrollment study . Disease radiologically image .</criteria>
