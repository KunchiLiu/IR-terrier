	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate effectiveness 24-week diet physical activity intervention 1-year maintenance intervention design produce maintain weight loss obese black woman . - To estimate effect intervention change fast serum insulin , glucose , free IGF-1 , IGFBP-1 , IGFBP-2 level well total IGF-1 IGFBP-3 level . Secondary - To compare change dietary consumption total calorie , total fat , fruit , vegetable , fiber well physical activity participant undergo weight-loss intervention v control intervention . - To compare change knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy , social support relate diet , physical activity , weight loss participant undergo weight-loss intervention v control intervention . - Assess efficacy weight-loss intervention mechanism association weight loss weight loss maintenance potential biologic mediator breast cancer risk . OUTLINE : Participants randomize 1 2 intervention arm . - Arm I ( weight-loss intervention ) : Participants undergo combine weight-loss intervention ( diet physical activity ) 24 week comprise individualized session interventionist monthly group session twice weekly . During group session , participant receive information diet , physical activity , weight loss take part exercise class . Participants receive handout , food-measuring tool , pedometer . Participants also discuss goal setting problem solve . During individualized session , participant undergo motivational interviewing ( MI ) assess individual need motivate make sustain behavioral change .

After completion maintenance intervention , participant undergo 10 intervention session receive study-related material ( handout , food-measuring tool , pedometer ) arm I . Blood sample collect baseline , 24 week , 18 month laboratory biomarker study . Samples analyze insulin level radioimmunoassay , glucose concentration , total free IGF-1 , IGFBP-1 , IGFBP-2 , IGFBP-3 enzyme-linked immunoassay .
