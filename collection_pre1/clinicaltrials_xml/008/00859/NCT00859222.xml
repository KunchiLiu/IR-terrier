	<brief_title>LBH589 Bevacizumab Patients With Recurrent High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I Primary Objective • To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) LBH589 combination bevacizumab give 10 mg/kg every 2 week patient recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) , gliosarcoma , anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic oligodendroglioma mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma . Secondary Objective • To define safety . Phase II Primary Objective • To determine efficacy LBH589 combination bevacizumab patient recurrent GBM gliosarcoma measure 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS6 ) . Secondary Objectives - To measure overall survival , time-to-tumor progression objective tumor response . - To evaluate safety . Exploratory Objectives - To provide preliminary data efficacy patient recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic oligodendroglioma mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma . - To explore relationship molecular phenotype tumor survival . - To investigate correlation treatment response laboratory correlate include , plasma angiogenic protein perfusion MRI . Statistical Design The Phase I study follow standard 3+3 dose escalation design . Three potential dose level oral LBH589 3x per week day 1 , 3 5 evaluation include start dose 0 weekly schedule well dose level 2 de-escalation dose level 1 weekly schedule . [ Note : The study amend revise start dose due concern thrombocytopenia weekly dose regimen . ] The DLT observation period first 30 day treatment . For Phase II study , base prior research bevacizumab monotherapy , PFS6 rate 35 % justify utilization LBH589 combination bevacizumab PFS6 rate 55 % worthy study . With 41 GBM eligible participant Phase II study , treatment would deem promising least 20 GBM participant achieve 6-month progression-free survival . This design least 85 % power 0.07 significance level predict difference null hypothesis 35 % PFS6 rate alternative hypothesis 55 % PFS6 rate . The protocol specifies plan interim analysis first 21 participant accrue . If 12 participant die experienced disease progression/ relapse within 6 month initiate treatment , accrual suspend data carefully review proceed additional patient accrual . Participants remove active treatment toxicity prior reach 6 month treatment include interim analysis . Participants recurrent GBM enrol phase I study maximum tolerate dose ( ie , phase II dose ) eligible inclusion interim analysis .</detailed_description>
