	<brief_title>Sunitinib Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open label , nonrandomized single institution study determine efficacy toxicity sunitinib certain subtypes soft tissue sarcoma . Patients stratify accord sarcoma histology ( angiosarcoma vs. hemangioendothelioma vs. Kaposi 's sarcoma ) . The purpose study determine clinical response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient metastatic , locally advanced , locally recurrent vascular soft tissue sarcoma treat sunitinib . Secondary objective 1 ) To determine 3 month 6 month progression free survival , define patient alive without evidence progression disease reassessment disease treat ; 2 ) To determine overall survival patient treated regimen ; 3 ) To determine safety tolerability sunitinib patient population .</detailed_description>
