	<brief_summary>The use ultrasound become widespread guide placement arterial line vascular access regional anesthesia field anesthesia . Arterial line placement challenging , especially pediatric population . Frequently multiple attempt require relatively high failure rate . This result excessive needle puncture extend OR time . A study look use ultrasound decrease OR time increase success rate adult pediatric population . These study compare traditional palpation method either short axis long axis view vessel use ultrasound guidance . No study date compare short axis long axis view arterial line placement either pediatric adult population . Our study compare success rate OR time long short axis method arterial line insertion employ pediatric population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Arterial Line Placement Long Axis Versus Short Axis Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An Arterial line intraoperative monitor frequently place pediatric population . Due small anatomy compliant skin , arterial line difficult insert pediatric population adult . Additionally , low perfusion pressure large subcutaneous adipose tissue make pulse palpation difficult . Ultrasound modality directly image radial , ulnar , brachial artery . Along 2D ultrasound , doppler ultrasound utilized confirm artery vein . Once vessel identify , vessel view either long short access . The ultrasound beam 1 millimeter thick practitioner must stabilize probe view vessel , especially long axis view . Once artery view long axis , needle directly visualized way vessel . Visualization guidewire catheter vessel confirm proper arterial access . In short access ultrasound view , possible see tissue movement sometimes hyperechoic ( bright ) dot represent needle . Tissue movement help confirm needle immediately artery time . The advantage short axis view less precision need hold position transducer long axis view . The disadvantage short axis view operator see tip angiocatheter enters vessel . As result , proximal portion angiocatheter artery distal tip could side artery .</detailed_description>
