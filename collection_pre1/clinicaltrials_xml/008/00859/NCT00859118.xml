	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see change happen tumor take axitinib stop ( schedule break ) , change tumor may responsible growth . This do use special kind scan call 18F-FLT PET/CT . In addition , investigator want find drug process distribute human body . The investigator also look different type cancer affect axitinib . The investigator also correlate vasculature kinetics extract dynamic FLT PET/CT image vasculature kinetics extract DCE-CT .</brief_summary>
