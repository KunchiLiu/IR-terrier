	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving gemcitabine together erlotinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together erlotinib work treat patient metastatic recurrent pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Erlotinib Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 1 , 8 , 15 oral erlotinib hydrochloride day 2-5 , 9-12 , 16-26 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archived tumor tissue sample analyze expression EGFR , HER3 , HER2 , downstream signal molecule , molecular marker immunohistochemistry RT-PCR . The presence aberrant gene copy number ( amplification polysomy ) EGFR , HER3 , HER2 determine FISH . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study polymorphism analysis correlative molecular analysis surrogate endpoint biomarkers . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm locally advance , metastatic recurrent pancreatic carcinoma Must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension No prior chemotherapy metastatic recurrent disease allow . Prior adjuvant chemotherapy allow provided patient receive gemcitabine chemotherapy complete &gt; six month prior initiation study therapy . Prior erlotinib therapy allow Available tumor specimen obtain time diagnosis and/or prior study entry highly encourage Age ≥ 18 year Life expectancy great 3 month Zubrod performance status ≤ 2 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/μL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/ μL platelet ≥ 100,000/ μL total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 X institutional upper limit normal , unless liver involved tumor , case AST/ALT must ≤ 5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 , measure 24hour collection OR creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal The effect erlotinib gemcitabine develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dos unknown . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition erlotinib gemcitabine . Secondary primary malignancy . Concurrent history another malignancy &lt; 5 year . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study erlotinib gemcitabine potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Breastfeeding discontinue mother treat study drug . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy .</criteria>
