	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To identify specific set protein cerebrospinal fluid ( fluid surround brain spinal cord ) , believe see Chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) patient , healthy control ( HC ) . A similar study investigator conduct , suggest significant change proteins cerebrospinal fluid may due fundamental pathology disorder . 2 . Increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure ( pressure help cerebrospinal fluid move around brain spinal cord ) , may relate certain symptom like headache , sleep problem , light headedness , increase pain , excessive tiredness ( fatigue ) even minimal work memory problem . 3 . Assessment Autonomic Nervous system function ( Sympathetic nervous system ) CFS HC . 4 . Perform Lung Function Testing pulmonary function test estimate lung capacity score shortness breath perform breathe maneuver . 5 . Dolorimetry ( 18 tender point test ) assessment pain threshold . 6 . Capsaicin skin test 7 . Allergy skin test</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neurological dysfunction key component clinical expression case designation chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) , fibromyalgia ( FM ) relate conditions.If central nervous system involve , evidence present cerebrospinal fluid . Distinct pattern protein present Chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) compare healthy control ( HC ) subject . Other test study would include : 1. ) Assessment lung function capacity . Additional interest assess shortness breath , lightheadedness , headache chest tightness breathe maneuver . The rationale record symptom understand pathophysiology sensory disturbance note CFS Fibromyalgia group , HC . 2 . Compare blood pressure heart rate response hand grip exercise test . This test measure Autonomic Nervous system function ( Sympathetic nervous system ) . 3 . Skin test like : ) Capsaicin skin test , check specific response like burn sensation , area skin redness , itchy sensation vary dos capsaicin ( essence chilli pepper ) , place forearm compare difference see response CFS Healthy control . ii ) Allergy skin test look allergy see set CFS population . 4 . 18 tenderness point test compare pain threshold lumbar puncture also know spinal tap . 18 tenderness point test diagnostic test Fibromyalgia . 5 . Many participant CFS associate Migraine headache complain severe light sound sensitivity . We analyse group people decision make medication would work best , thus provide immediate relief headache .</detailed_description>
