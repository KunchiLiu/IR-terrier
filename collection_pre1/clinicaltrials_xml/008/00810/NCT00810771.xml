	<brief_title>Evaluating Preference-based Intervention Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) significant preventable disease , yet CRC screening remain one low quality indicator VA healthcare system . Moreover , recent VA directive recommend CRC screening among Veterans base preference , give insufficient evidence support recommend one test . However impact preference-based strategy important outcome , include screen adherence cost , unknown . Objectives : The broad hypothesis propose study help Veterans clarify CRC screen preference lead increase adherence . The framework conceptualize preference clarification lead inform decision-making , eventually , good adherence screening . The specific aim : 1 ) To test effectiveness preference-tailored ( PT ) vs. standard information ( SI ) intervention increase Veterans ' CRC screen adherence ; 2 ) To assess impact intervention inform decision making , knowledge attitude toward screen , decisional outcome , intention get screen ; 3 ) To conduct cost effectiveness analysis PT intervention increase CRC screen across VA. Methods : A randomized control trial PT vs. SI decision tool conduct Ann Arbor Pittsburgh VA healthcare system . The intervention develop PI work Center Health Communication Research University Michigan . Eligible patient 552 ( 276 per group ) Veterans 50 78 due CRC screening , primary care visit schedule within upcoming 4-6 week . Those high risk ( e.g. , family personal history CRC ) exclude . Providers inform study via regular mail email . In Ann Arbor provider give opportunity opt-out participant choose . In Pittsburgh provider give list participant consider study give chance remove potential participant contact list . Potential participant mail introductory letter . Those opt-out contacted telephone . Participants come primary care visit 40 minute early , time complete informed consent . The intervention deliver via Internet , participant randomize PT SI arm time log-in . Study measure consistent conceptual framework base Preventive Health Model . Preference information collect computer program . Secondary outcome independent variable collect via telephone survey 3 day follow intervention . Adherence screen collect medical chart 6 month . CRC screen information sub-sample 80 Ann Arbor Veterans , either PT SI group , also collect measure `` usual care '' ( UC ) . Pittsburgh use External Peer Review Program ( EPRP ) collection clinical performance measure , specifically CRC screen rate , serve effective substitute UC group . Hypotheses related aim test use multi-level model control between-provider effect . The overall hypothesis patient PT group high rate adherence CRC screen 6 month follow-up point . Cost effectiveness analysis determine whether preference-based screening strategy could cost effective VA healthcare system . The PI work investigative team disseminate result local national VA website , publication presentation . Status : Active , recruiting .</detailed_description>
