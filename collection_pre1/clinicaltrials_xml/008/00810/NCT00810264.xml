	<detailed_description>This study FDA-required , multi-center , prospective , non-randomized , data collection registry . Eligible patient must successfully implant Corox OTW BP , Corox OTW-S BP , Corox OTW-L BP LV lead BIOTRONIK CRT device consent enrolled 7-180 day follow implant . At least 2500 patient enrol post-approval registry , patient follow five year post-implant . Safety evaluate base analysis overall incidence lead-related adverse event require additional invasive intervention . In addition , individual adverse event separately investigate . Lead parameter sense , pace threshold , impedance also evaluate . Reporting adverse event perform twice year order identify characterize trend adverse event , failure mode , failure rate .</detailed_description>
