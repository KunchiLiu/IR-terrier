	<brief_title>Effect Aspergillus Niger Prolyl Endoprotease ( AN-PEP ) Enzyme Effects Gluten Ingestion Patients With Coeliac Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study determine whether AN-PEP enzyme effective mitigating effect 8 g wheat protein ingestion patient celiac disease . Fourteen patient coeliac disease , 18-70 year old recruit . During first period , patient consume daily gluten-containing food product AN-PEP enzyme 2 week . After 2-week washout period ( second period ) , patient enter third period study , randomize one two group consume gluten-containing food product AN-PEP placebo . Period 1 : Patients give food product contain 8 g wheat protein , AN-PEP add , daily 14 d. Period 2 : Wash-out period 14 d. During period , patient consume gluten-free diet . Period 3 : Patients negative coeliac disease symptom 1st period randomize across two group . Both group receive food product contain 8 g wheat protein daily 14 d. One group receive additional AN-PEP gluten meal whereas group receive placebo . Patients visit outpatient clinic five time ; one visit start study , visit end first period , visit end third period . During three visit , spike-biopsies take duodenum oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy . Blood sample take five visit . Patients also fill quality life questionnaire start end first third period .</detailed_description>
