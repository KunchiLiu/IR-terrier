	<brief_summary>Background : Patients suffer respiratory failure need mechanical ventilation risk deterioration due complication induce progression lung disease mechanical ventilation . The complication usually develop progressive manner , currently detect relatively late , already severe life threaten deterioration patient oxygenation sometimes irreversible damage . Objective : To measure chest wall dynamic , derive sensor place chest abdomen . Methods : The system comprise patch attach chest wall upper abdomen include mechanical sensor measure mechanic lung inflation deflation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients suffer respiratory failure need mechanical ventilation risk life threaten deterioration follow development mechanical problem relate airway management , development lung barotrauma displacement endotracheal tube . Neonates especially need tight sensitive monitoring lung ventilation , high prevalence lung disease need ventilatory support population . Methods : The system comprise patch attach chest wall epigastrium . The patch include sensor measure mechanic lung inflation deflation . Study protocol - Following parental informed consent , three patch place side chest epigastric area infant require tight respiratory monitoring . - The patch place beside ECG patch . - The placement patch perform physician . - The monitoring preform long baby need tight respiratory monitoring . The patch replace accord routine replacement policy patch neonatal intensive care unit , regular time define attending staff , long 24 hour . At end data acquisition , patch remove . - No additional intervention require . - The patient inspect supervise physician involve research . - It provide data may alter treatment interfere influence monitoring device use evaluate clinical status patient . - The parameter regularly monitor , display bedside monitor respirator record research assistant . The ventilated baby identify study number . There separate database measurement demographic clinical data . There disclosure patient 's identity along data analysis publication result communication authority medical practitioner . Equipment safety : The system safe use human subject . The whole system approve safety accord acquire standard ICE-60601</detailed_description>
