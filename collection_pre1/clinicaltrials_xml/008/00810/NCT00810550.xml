	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD , cholesterol plaque buildup heart artery ) common cause leave ventricular systolic dysfunction ( weaken heart muscle ) . The standard test find coronary artery disease coronary angiography . This test highly accurate invasive carry small risk complication . This study investigate ultrasound carotid ( neck ) arteries screen test severe coronary artery disease cause leave ventricular systolic dysfunction . It hypothesize carotid ultrasound excellent negative predictive value severe CAD .</brief_summary>
