	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study NeoFuse Subjects Requiring Posterolateral Lumbar Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , randomize , open-label control Phase 1b/2a study design evaluate safety preliminary efficacy MPCs combine MasterGraft Granules compare use autologous bone graft posterolateral fusion site subject require interbody fusion combination instrument 1 2 level PLF procedure . All subject study undergo 1 2-level ( 2 3 vertebra ) interbody fusion without use investigational product . In addition interbody fusion procedure , subject undergo instrumented posterolateral fusion . NeoFuse plus MasterGraft Granules one three dos autograft implant posterolateral lumbar fusion site ( ) . After screen surgical visit , subject evaluate clinically radiographically within 3 day 30 day surgery , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month surgery . Subjects evaluate 24 36 month surgery safety .</detailed_description>
