	<brief_summary>Autoregulation ability vascular bed maintain blood flow despite change perfusion pressure . For long time assume choroid strictly passive vascular bed , show autoregulation . However , recently several group identify autoregulatory capacity human choroid . In brain retina mechanism behind autoregulation likely link change transmural pressure . In model arteriole change vascular tone depend pressure inside vessel outside vessel . In choroid , several observation argue direct involvement arteriole . However , mechanism behind choroidal autoregulation remain unclear . In present study autoregulation choroid investigate decrease ocular perfusion pressure , achieve increase intraocular pressure . Pressure/flow relationship investigate absence presence NO synthase inhibitor . As control substance alpha-receptor agonist phenylephrine use .</brief_summary>
