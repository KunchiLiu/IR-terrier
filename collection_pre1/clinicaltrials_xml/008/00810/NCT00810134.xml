	<brief_summary>The aim study compare PTFE-graft bypass surgery versus Viabahn endoprosthesis femoropopliteal arterial occlusion intermittent claudication critical ischaemia patient would technically amenable treatment . The primary objective compare primary patency two treatment . The secondary objective study evaluate secondary patency , functional status , quality life cost new endovascular therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bypass Thurpass Superficial Femoral Artery Occlusion ? Scandinavian Thurpass Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Femoropopliteal bypass graft surgery PTFE-prosthesis proven acceptable treatment stable incapacitate claudication critical ischaemia patient superficial femoral artery occlusion . Preliminary result thrupass endoprosthesis treatment femoral lesion promise . Less morbidity well cost-effectiveness suggest achieved treatment chronic low limb ischaemia endovascular treatment compare surgical treatment . A randomised multicentre trial aim enrol pilot group 60 + 60 patient follow 3 year . Patients treat either Viabahn thrupass endoprosthesis ( Gore corp. ) 6 mm PTFE-prosthesis bypass graft surgery . Primary patency three year primary end point secondary patency , functional success , cost quality life secondary end point .</detailed_description>
