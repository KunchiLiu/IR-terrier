	<brief_summary>The propose research study test drug vorinostat , new use additional medication , standard treatment prevention severe acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . If treatment safe effective , combine reduced intensity transplant , research may achieve effective therapy patient high-risk , blood cell related cancer . All subject receive identical , know treatment test treatment safe effective ( phase II trial ) . For patient take part must high-risk , blood cell cancer , suitable candidate receive reduce intensity transplant match , related donor . Adult subject ( age 18 year old ) consider subject provide , detailed protocol , meet additional criterion exclude participate . About fifty ( 50 ) subject enrol study University Michigan . Patients receive blood stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) , also call bone marrow transplant , treat cancer risk serious complication , may sometimes fatal . The common , serious one relapse ( return disease ) , body organ injury intensity chemotherapy give prior transplant , serious complication call graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . GVHD form rejection , transplant cell donor attack recipient 's body foreign , damage organ tissue . To decrease side effect chemotherapy give transplant , reduce intensity treatment plan ( regimen ) recently develop number transplant center . A decrease side effect chemotherapy ( call toxicity ) achieve ; however , success `` less intensive '' treatment partially offset less successful result control patient 's cancer . As mentioned , GVHD form transplant rejection . GVHD affect digestive system , skin , liver body system . GVHD increase risk infection . After match , relate donor stem cell transplant , GVHD severe , major cause discomfort , organ damage , even death . When graft v host reaction develop , keep control , study show may beneficial graft versus tumor effect , help destroy tumor cell patient , thus provide effective control cancer . The goal study try maximize potential benefit , give patient less intense chemotherapy reduce toxic effect , let graft v host effect help destroy tumor cell , prevent acute severe GVHD use drug vorinostat , combine standard medicine , reduce chance serious GVHD-related complication .</brief_summary>

For MDS , acute leukemia CML : must &lt; 20 % blast marrow exam . For disease : must nonrefractory disease . meet least ONE next three criterion : Any patient ≥ 18 year age hematological malignancy consider candidate allogeneic myeloablative transplant due illness and/or age ( ≥55 year ) . Any patient ≥ 18 year age relapse follow prior autologous allogeneic transplant hematologic malignancy . Any patient ≥ 18 year age diagnose hematological malignancy reduce intensity transplant institutionally prefer myeloablative transplant ( eg , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ) . Less 18 year age . Currently take HDAC inhibitor , take HDAC inhibitor within 30 day trial . Positive serum test HIV , HTLV1 / HTLV2 . Detectable hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , hepatitis C ( HCV ) EpsteinBarr ( EBV ) . Pregnancy . One follow organ system function criterion Cardiac : Ejection fraction ≤ 40 % Renal : Estimated actual GFR ≤ 40 ml/min ( correct BSA ) Pulmonary : FEV1 , FVC , DLCO ≤ 40 % predict Hepatic : Total bilirubin ≥3 mg % AST/ALT &gt; 5 x institutional normal age Karnofsky score ≤50 ( Requires considerable assistance frequent medical care ) . Persistent invasive infection control antimicrobial medication . Any physical psychological condition , opinion investigator , would pose unacceptable risk patient .</criteria>
