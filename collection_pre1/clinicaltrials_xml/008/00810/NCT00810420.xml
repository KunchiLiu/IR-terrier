	<brief_summary>The aim study base recent pilot study carry Odense University Hospital show acute change electroencephalographic ( EEG ) signal ( i.e . electrical activity inthe brain ) elicit insulin-induced hypoglycemia patient type 1 diabetes reliable detect real-time processing EEG signal use mathematical algorithm state art noise artifact reduction . These preliminary result also show hypoglycemia-induced EEG change detectable 15-30 min deterioration cognitive function impedes adequate response warning . We hypothesize observation apply majority patient type 1 diabetes , therefore , possible develop automate device detect hypoglycemic episode continuous real-time monitoring processing EEG signal . To test hypothesis , specific aim present proposal : 1 . Detection hypoglycemia-induced EEG change use subcutaneous electrode 2 . Ambulatory EEG monitor use subcutaneous electrode</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EEG-Changes During Insulininduced Hypoglycemia Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The near-normalization glycemic control become establish treatment goal diabetes order reduce late complication nephropathy , neuropathy , retinopathy cardiovascular disease ( 1,2 ) . However , frequency insulin-induced hypoglycemia increase several-fold intensified insulin therapy ( 2,3 ) . Thus , hypoglycemia common acute complication treatment diabetes insulin . During hypoglycemia cognitive function disturb , may progress unconsciousness seizure . This lead high-risk situation , e.g . drive operate machine . Estimates deaths patient type 1 diabetes attribute hypoglycemia vary 2 % 6 % ( 4,5 ) . Moreover , risk hypoglycemia limit everyday activity diabetic patient decrease quality life . It therefore surprising hypoglycemia fear acute complication insulin therapy diabetic patient . This fear hypoglycemia discourage diabetic subject attempt maintain tight glycemic control , turn lead high incidence late complication consequently increase mortality rate ( 1,6,7 ) In first year type 1 diabetes , patient able sense characteristic symptom hypoglycemia , relieve consume appropriate food . The symptom hypoglycemia roughly classify autonomic ( warn ) symptom cause release catecholamine , neuroglycopenic symptom cause lack glucose brain . In many patient symptom often compromise night ( nocturnal asymptomatic hypoglycemia ) due impair glucose counterregulatory response adrenaline glucagon . The chronic form hypoglycemia unawareness common . A quarter insulin-treated diabetic patient degree diminish symptomatic awareness , proportion increase almost 50 % patient diabetes 20 year ( 8 ) . Strict control diabetes intensive insulin therapy associate increase risk hypoglycemia unawareness syndrome loss autonomic warning symptom ( 2,6,9 ) . This seem involve diminish hormonal glucose counterregulation due recurrent hypoglycemic episode ( 6,9 ) . For reason , number study carry aim develop automatic detection system , warn diabetic patient blood glucose level reduce level severe neuroglycopenia develops , typically 2.0-2.5 mmol/l . Most study evaluate potential continuous glucose monitoring ( CMG ) decrease frequency hypoglycemia . Although , small study report low risk hypoglycemia use CMG compare conventional glucose measurement ( 10,11 ) , large multi-center study fail reproduce finding ( 11-14 ) . This could explain low accuracy low range glucose value delay detection time rapid change use CMG ( 11,13,14 ) . In fact , CMG recognize less 50 % hypoglycemic event ( 15 ) . Thus , even marginal improvement compare conventional glucose measurement , CMG far goal completely avoid severe hypoglycemic episode . The EEG signal reflect functional state metabolism brain . The brain almost totally dependent continuous supply glucose , low metabolic requirement brain , function deteriorates . Indeed , neuroglycopenic hypoglycemia insulin-treated diabetic patient associate characteristic change EEG decrease alpha activity , increase delta activity , particular increase theta activity ( 16-19 ) . These change clearly see ~2.0 mmol/l ( 16,17 ) , may present already high glucose level ( ~3.0 mmol/l ) , particular type 1 diabetic patient hypoglycemic unawareness ( 19,20 ) . It show characteristic change , increase theta activity , appear 19 min severe cognitive impairment ( 20 ) . This suggest `` window '' hypoglycemia-induced EEG change severe neuroglycepenia , important prerequisite develop automatic detection system capable warning patient . A number study characterize change EEG result hypoglycemia ( 16-20 ) , none propose method process test real-time . With device , perform real-time monitoring processing EEG signal automatically detect warn patient hypoglycemia-induced EEG change , would possible patient avoid severe neuroglypenic symptom e.g . ingestion carbohydrate . The construction EEG-based hypoglycemia alarm system must fulfill follow criterion . First , device able distinguish hypoglycemia-induced EEG change normal change EEG , noise artifact high sensitivity specificity use mathematical algorithm classifies EEG real-time . Second , EEG change observe majority insulin-treated diabetic patient hypoglycemia . Third , `` window '' hypoglycemia-induced EEG change severe cognitive impairment . Moreover , device fully compatible normal everyday activity . Thus , electrode thin implant subcutaneously , monitor process unit small , sufficient battery power , capable communicate PDA cell phone .</detailed_description>
