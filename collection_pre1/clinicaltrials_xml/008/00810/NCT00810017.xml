	<brief_summary>This study woman men previously treat metastatic ( spread part body ) , Her2- positive breast cancer . The purpose study find effect ( good bad ) FDA-approved drug etoposide trastuzumab type breast cancer determine drug safe use together . This research do find effective treatment type condition . In study , trastuzumab etoposide give intravenous infusion ( IV ; vein ) first 3 day every 3-week cycle . This repeat 6 cycle . After 6 cycle , trastuzumab give worsen disease . In study , small amount tissue collect surgery evaluate lab look genetic difference among people difference may affect response specific drug medicine . This test look gene call Top2A . Previous study suggest people Top2A Her2 gene respond certain chemotherapy ( anti-cancer drug ) differently Her2 gene .</brief_summary>
