	<brief_title>FERINJECT Correction Anaemia IBD Patients , FER-IBD-COR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anaemia inflammatory bowel disease mainly attribute iron deficiency . The main cause anaemia IBD patient chronic blood loss . This mean iron storage depot IBD patient always low replenish . Oral iron therapy first choice many case safety economy . However , patient gastrointestinal bleeding , effectiveness oral therapy reduce . Additionally , oral iron preparation frequently associate gastrointestinal adverse reaction . According European Guidelines , preferred route iron supplementation IBD intravenous . Absolute indication intravenous iron include severe anaemia ( Hb &lt; 10 g/dL ) . The current study part programme investigate efficacy safety FERINJECT® , new formulation parenteral iron ( 5 % weight per volume iron contain ferric carboxymaltose solution water injection ) . The efficacy safety FERINJECT® investigate prospective , randomise , control study conduct IBD patient . According result study , FERINJECT® provide faster Hb response , high increase iron storage well patient tolerance compare oral preparation . In study , iron amount require calculate accord Ganzoni formula , 500 mg amount storage iron . To simplify treatment make treatment effective , new standardise dosage regimen create . The current study design assess whether new standardised dosage regimen i.v . FERINJECT® safe effective currently use individually calculated dosage regimen . The efficacy safety new standardise dosage regimen FERINJECT® compare already establish , well-known treatment IDA iron sucrose ( VENOFER® ) . Iron sucrose ( VENOFER® ) assess effective well-tolerated treatment IDA IBD patient . The study phase IIIb , multi-centre , randomise , prospective , open-label , control study perform 83 study centre 14 European country . The primary objective study evaluate non-inferiority efficacy standardise dosage regimen FERINJECT® compare individually calculate dosage regimens VENOFER® correction IDA patient IBD remission . The secondary objective evaluate safety tolerability standardise correction dose regimen FERINJECT® . Approximately 420 patient randomise ( 1:1 randomisation ) receive treatment either standardised correction dosage regimen FERINJECT® individually calculate dosage regimen VENOFER® . Screening start 14 7 day first infusion administer . Baseline assessment perform Day 1 first infusion . During screen period , patient select base eligibility criterion . Patients meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion undergo baseline assessment Baseline ( Day 1 ) prior first dose study medication . Patients randomise FERINJECT® group receive 500 mg 2000 mg FERINJECT® , accord Hb body weight , 3 infusion . The maximum infused weekly dose 1000 mg. For patient VENOFER® group , individual iron deficit calculate per individual use modified formula Ganzoni . Patients receive one infusion 200 mg VENOFER® twice week , 11 infusion , depend calculate iron deficit . Due relatively large dos iron administer , patient monitor carefully throughout study symptom iron overload . All patient return assessment efficacy safety Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 . The maximum study duration patient 14 week . Patients anaemic Week 12 invite continue participate maintenance study ( FER-IBD-07-MAIN ) , i.e . study FERINJECT® versus placebo determine treatment iron deficiency prevent recurrence anaemia .</detailed_description>
