	<detailed_description>Blood transfusion may opposite immune effect patient . One sensitization . The immunosuppression . The magnitude problem patient chemotherapy unknown . Of patient receive donor blood , 50-90 percent become sensitized ( make antibody ) HLA proteins present white blood cell donor blood . This undesired effect patient need organ stem cell transplant , increase risk rejection . Another effect receive blood transfusion , immunosuppression , cause decrease immune response compromise patient ' ability fight infection tumor cell . These effect - sensitization immunosuppression - thought due largely white blood cell present transfusion product . Doctors order specially pretreated blood transfusion deplete white blood cell aim minimize risk `` immunocompromised '' patient . `` Leukofiltration '' `` gamma-irradiation '' special treatment deplete white blood cell . A combination leukofiltration gamma-irradiation pretreatment donor blood think deplete white blood cell effectively . Therefore , blood pretreated way give patient need stem cell transplant others immunosuppressed . Sometimes pretreated leukofiltration gamma-irradiated blood use `` regular '' patient immunocompromised blood use expire waste . However , doctor know sure whether expensive pretreatments really beneficial `` regular '' patient undergo cardiac surgery whether would change risk develop sensitization immunosuppression . In study , patient randomly assign receive blood product pretreated one three way : untreated , filter filter irradiate . If physician order transfusion , receive product assign group . Patients ask provide two blood sample 4 week surgery . Studies measure change antibody HLA cell regulate immune response . It unknown treatment ( leukofiltration without gamma-irradiation compare pretreatment ) beneficial patient immunosuppressed . This study design provide information patient ' immune response exposure transfuse blood . This information may useful care patient future require transfusion cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
