	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate feasibility re-escalating dose sorafenib tosylate patient advance malignant solid tumor initially require dose reduction toxicity , dose escalation patient able tolerate initial dose . Secondary - To evaluate efficacy drug patient able tolerate dose escalation initially dose reduction compare unable tolerate dose escalation . Tertiary - To evaluate percentage demographic characteristic patient able tolerate 2 dose escalation without dose reduction . OUTLINE : This dose-finding study . - Course 1 : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily dose level 0 week 1-4 . - Course 2 : Patients experience dose-limiting intolerable toxicity receive oral sorafenib tosylate dose level +1 twice daily week 5-8 ; patient experience dose-limiting intolerable toxicity receive oral sorafenib tosylate dose level -1 daily week 5-8 . - Course 3 : Depending whether patient experience dose-limiting intolerable toxicity , escalate dose level 0 dose level +2 ( patient dose level receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily ) week 9-12 , de-escalated dose level 0 dose level -2 ( patient dose level -2 receive oral sorafenib tosylate every day ) week 9-12 . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate dose level* attained end course 3 . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Dose level de-escalation toxicity dose re-escalation toxicity-related dose reduction allow maximum level initial dose level maintenance therapy . After completion study therapy , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
