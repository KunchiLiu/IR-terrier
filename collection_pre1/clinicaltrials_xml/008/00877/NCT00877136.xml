	<brief_title>A Treatment Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma With TheraSphere®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol provide supervise access institution TheraSphere® treatment heterogeneous population patient unresectable primary liver tumor , liver dominant site disease . Based experience gain previous study well-established interventional radiology technique , protocol allow multiple treatment TheraSphere® may deliver inpatient patient basis . Patients may receive single dose whole liver , lobar treatment deliver sequence treatment approximately 30 - 90 day apart . The investigator , work co-investigators radiation oncology , interventional radiology nuclear medicine , develop specific treatment plan patient , base upon present condition patient , vascular anatomy , desire goal treatment .</detailed_description>
