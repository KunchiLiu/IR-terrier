	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking increase CVD risk worsens insulin resistance , also contribute weight loss ; smoke cessation reduces CVD risk improve insulin sensitivity , also contribute weight gain . The mechanisms underlie metabolic change cigarette smoke smoke cessation insulin resistance , body composition , fat distribution poorly understood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance Smokers Undergoing Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , open cohort study smoker undergo smoke cessation program , subsequently may may resume smoke spontaneously . Eligible subject characterize baseline respect metabolic CVD risk profile , body fat composition distribution . Subjects undergo intensive 8-week smoking cessation program use bupropion plus cognitive behavioral counseling . Those successfully abstain reassess . Since individual quit smoke naturally resume smoke time , subject assess additional 4 month follow-up subset subject expect naturally resume smoking .</detailed_description>
