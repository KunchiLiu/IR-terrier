	<brief_summary>Advanced HCC represent high unmet medical need poor prognosis therapeutic option . Patients present HCC beyond currently accept Milan criterion eligible list liver transplantation . The propose study offer local regional therapy define population patient beyond Milan criterion attempt downstage eligibility liver transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LC Drug Eluting Bead Treatment Liver Cancer Which Can Surgically Removed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LC BeadTM new product specifically design TACE . LC BeadTM microspheres load doxorubicin ( Trade name : adriamycin ) , chemotherapeutic anthracycline glycolide agent widely accept treatment HCC . This novel bead slowly release ionically bind chemotherapeutic agent rather administer bolus chemotherapy case many alternative method TACE . Thus , LC BeadTM offer potential advantage less toxicity prolong tumor exposure . This study offer local regional therapy define population patient beyond transplant criterion attempt downstage eligibility liver transplantation . This study make important contribution understand bead ' local effect see explanted liver patient go receive liver transplant . Additionally , examine impact novel treatment tool patient ' quality life .</detailed_description>
