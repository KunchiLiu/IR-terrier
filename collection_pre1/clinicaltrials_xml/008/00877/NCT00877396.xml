	<brief_summary>The goal randomize clinical trial determine whether immunize child Hutterite colony inactivate influenza vaccine prevent influenza complication colony member . Furthermore , study ass indirect benefit Hutterites high risk complication . The study blind , cluster randomize control trial among Hutterite colony test hypothesis high immunization rate ( &gt; 70 % ) healthy child inactivate influenza vaccine reduces transmission influenza colony member . Randomization homogeneous , moderately sized colony regular spread facilitate communal lifestyle , limited re-introduction relative isolation outside community , represent unique opportunity test hypothesis indirect benefit close ideal condition . The primary outcome laboratory-confirmed influenza . Secondary outcome include influenza-like illness , otitis medium , physician visit , antimicrobial prescription , absenteeism , low respiratory tract infection , hospitalization , death .</brief_summary>
