	<brief_summary>When patient chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) admit hospital severe exacerbation lose muscle strength . This muscle weakness predispose patient hospital admission . Resistance train potent countermeasure prevent treat muscle weakness . In set acute exacerbation intervention however validate . The present study aim investigate safety efficacy resistance training ( 3x8 quadriceps extension per day ) prevent muscle weakness . End point quadriceps muscle strength hospital readmission functional status discharge . Using minimally invasive needle muscle biopsy technique describe Bergstr√∂m effect resistance training skeletal muscle analyze detail . After give informed consent , patient randomize admission usual care usual care plus resistance training . Patients followed-up use clinical pathway COPD ( 10 day ) . After one month patient attend outpatient clinic follow-up visit . Besides measurement prescribed clinical path COPD ( include arterial blood gas measure , lung function , functional investigation patient ) , patient undergo muscle strength measure venous blood drawn analysis systemic inflammatory growth factor . Half patient receive resistance training program . At end hospital admission , needle biopsy vastus lateralis muscle obtain .</brief_summary>
