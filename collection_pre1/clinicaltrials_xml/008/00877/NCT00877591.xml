	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine interaction buprenorphine-naloxone , medication use treat opiate ( heroin prescription narcotic ) dependence , medication use treatment HIV disease include atazanavir ( Reyataz ) , fosamprenavir ( Lexiva ) , didanosine ( Videx ) , tenofovir ( Viread ) , atazanavir ( Reyataz ) /ritonavir ( Norvir ) , fosamprenavir ( Lexiva ) /ritonavir ( Norvir ) , lamivudine ( Epivir ) , darunavir ( please note complete drug interaction study buprenorphine atazanavir , atazanavir/ritonavir , didanosine , tenofovir lamivudine ) PI 's previous university ; CHR application study need complete UCSF/SFGH discuss ) tuberculosis ( TB ) ( rifampin rifabutin ) medication ( note : supplement application currently pending ) . Participants opioid dependence qualify buprenorphine/naloxone treatment healthy subject without opioid dependence participate pharmacokinetics study antiretroviral medication . A total 160 individual enrol study ( please note study ongoing Virginia Commonwealth University 3 year total number participant recruit UCSF/SFGH 50 protocol completers ) . Participants take HIV tuberculosis medicine ( ) 15 day ( depend medication ( ) administer ability schedule blood urine sampling session ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective project , RO1 DA 13004 `` Opioids HIV Medications : Interactions Drug Abusers '' supplement `` Interaction Buprenorphine TB Medications , '' continue improve clinical care human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected , substance-abusing patient identify significant interaction may occur drug commonly use treat HIV disease tuberculosis buprenorphine , new opioid use maintenance treatment opioid dependence important addition exist substance abuse pharmacotherapies use restrict specialized opiate treatment program . The research fund grant past year show presence significant clinically important drug interaction methadone LAAM combination antiretroviral medication . Understanding drug interaction allow physician safely effectively treat HIV disease opioid-dependent patient . The follow specific aim yet complete project another 2 year 5 year funding period : 1 . Continuation study determine whether pharmacokinetics buprenorphine affect coadministration follow HIV medication fosamprenavir/ritonavir , darunavir TB medication , rifampin rifabutin . This do comparing pharmacokinetics buprenorphine absence presence HIV medication use within subject study design participant opioid-dependent , without HIV infection , receive medication maintenance treatment buprenorphine/naloxone ( please note naloxone absorption negligible add buprenorphine preparation drug manufacturer diminish likelihood diversion drug inject abuse ) . These study allow answer major question concern patient clinician : Could start one HIV medication TB medication result opioid overdose withdrawal ? These study determine whether buprenorphine accumulation toxicity might occur whether buprenorphine concentration standard medication dose subtherapeutic and/or expose patient risk opioid withdrawal symptom conjoint HIV TB therapy . 2 . Continuation study determine whether pharmacokinetics HIV medication fosamprenavir/ritonavir darunavir , affected coadministration buprenorphine . This do between-subjects study compare pharmacokinetics HIV medication group patient treated buprenorphine control group without opioid dependence HIV infection . It important identify interaction lead increased exposure HIV therapeutic concomitant increase side-effects toxicity . In addition unnecessary discomfort hazard , may lead non-adherence and/or increase substance abuse particularly side effect interpret opioid withdrawal . Equally important , substantial decrease level HIV drug could lead subtherapeutic level , inadequate viral suppression , development antiretroviral resistance therapeutic failure . ( Please note TB medication supplemental study within-subjects component buprenorphine complete due budgetary constraint supplement . ) Important clinical effect relate concomitant buprenorphine/HIV therapeutic TB medication administration also collect include : 1 . Measures opioid withdrawal symptom collect prior follow simultaneous buprenorphine/antiretroviral administration 2 . Measures cognitive function collect prior follow simultaneous buprenorphine/antiretroviral administration 3 . Measures occurrence adverse event systematically collect chronicle prior follow simultaneous buprenorphine/antiretroviral administration 4 . Effect buprenorphine alone buprenorphine combination antiretroviral administration cardiac conduction obtain serial electrocardiogram . 5 . Effect buprenorphine alone combination antiretroviral anti-TB medication administration hepatic function serial collection laboratory blood test liver function gain insight potential drug produce hepatotoxicity . The experimental protocol allow set study ( Aims 1 2 ) accomplish simultaneously buprenorphine-maintained subject , thereby achieve substantial efficiency current project . The study offer cost-effective method rapid determination presence clinical significance drug interaction buprenorphine pharmacotherapies infectious disease great clinical importance .</detailed_description>
