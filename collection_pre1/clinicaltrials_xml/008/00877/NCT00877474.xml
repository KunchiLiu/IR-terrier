	<brief_title>Phase I , Multicenter , Open-label , Dose-escalating , Clinical Pharmacokinetic Study PM01183 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I , multicenter , open-label , dose escalate clinical pharmacokinetic study PM01183 patient advance solid tumor identify dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) , determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend dose ( RD ) PM01183 administer every three week intravenously ( i.v . ) one hour patient advance solid tumor preliminarily determine pharmacokinetics PM01183 , evaluate antitumor activity PM01183 safety tolerability PM01183 . Besides study evaluate pharmacogenomics tumor sample peripheral white blood cell ( PWBCs ) patient expose PM01183 RD order ass potential marker response and/or resistance .</detailed_description>
