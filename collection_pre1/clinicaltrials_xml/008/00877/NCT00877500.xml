	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn certain gene protein tumor respond well treatment . These feature compare status disease surgery breast cancer express HER2 protein , patient either receive receive ixabepilone . The safety ixabepilone group patient also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study Ixabepilone Versus Observation Patients With Significant Residual Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Ixabepilone design work block cell division , may cause cancer cell death . Surgery : You surgery part standard care . Your tissue test measure residual disease ( leftover cancer ) . If low amount leftover disease , eligible take part study . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . If Group 1 , receive ixabepilone . You also treat standard care treatment disease , include radiation and/or hormonal therapy ( appropriate ) . If Group 2 , receive study drug . You treat standard care treatment disease , include radiation and/or hormonal therapy ( appropriate ) . Study Drug Administration Group 1 : If Group 1 , receive ixabepilone though needle vein 3 hour Day 1 21-day study cycle . Before infusion , give drug , vein , help decrease risk allergic reaction . These drug include Benadryl® ( diphenhydramine ) , Tagamet® ( cimetidine ) , Decadron ( dexamethasone ) . The infusion last 30-45 minute . If experience severe side effect , future treatment may delay , dose may decrease , may take study . Study Visits : Group 1 : On Day 1 cycle , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You physical exam . - You ask side effect may experience may experience since last visit . Group 2 : At end radiation ( day baseline blood collection ) , Weeks 9 18 , physical exam medical history record . Circulating Tumor Cell ( CTC ) testing : Blood ( 2 tablespoon time ) drawn surgery measure amount CTCs blood . If Group 1 , blood drawn Cycles 4 end Cycle 6 . If Group 2 , blood drawn Weeks 9 18 . Length Study : If Group 1 , may receive study drug 6 cycle . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . If Group 2 , study Week 18 . This investigational study . Ixabepilone FDA approve commercially available metastatic ( advanced ) breast cancer . Up 116 patient take part multicenter study . Up 116 may enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologic confirmation invasive HER2/neunegative breast cancer ( IHC 01+ FISHnegative ) receive complete anthracycline taxane neoadjuvant systemic therapy time surgery expect significant residual disease . Therapy include least 4 cycle anthracyclinebased regimen ( AC , FAC , FEC ) 12 week taxanebased regimen ( weekly paclitaxel , every 3week docetaxel ) . 2 . Patients complete therapy due disease progression eligible . 3 . Age &gt; /= 18 year 4 . Patients bilateral breast cancer eligible . 5 . Patients Karnofsky performance scale =/ &gt; 70 % . 6 . Patient adequate bone marrow function , define peripheral granulocyte count &gt; /= 1500/mm^3 , platelet count &gt; /= 100000 mm^3 . 7 . Patients must adequate liver function bilirubin within normal laboratory value . Alkaline phosphatase transaminase ( ALT AST ) may 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) institution . 8 . Patients adequate renal function creatinine level within normal range . 9 . Negative serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . 10 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCP ) must use reliable appropriate contraceptive method study 6 month chemotherapy complete . WOCBP woman menopausal 12 month previous surgical sterilization . 11 . Patients must agree study tissue collection blood sample collection . 12 . Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study , keep institutional policy . 13 . Patients surgical tissue evaluate RCB use correlative study . 14 . Sexually active woman childbearing potential must use effective method birth control course fo study , manner risk failure minimize . Prior study enrollment , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . In addition , men enrol study understand risk sexual partner childbearing potential practice effective method birth control . 15 . All WOCBP MUST negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior first receive investigational product . If pregnancy test positive , patient must receive investigational product must enrol study . In addition , WOCBP instruct contact Investigator immediately suspect might pregnant ( e.g. , miss late menstrual period ) time study participation . The PI immediately notify BMS event confirm pregnancy patient participate study . 1 . Patients whose tumor express HER2 protein HER2/neu gene amplification . 2 . Patients history invasive malignancy diagnose treat within previous 5 year , except nonmelanoma skin cancer noninvasive cervical cancer 3 . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease could compromise participation study ( i.e. , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , severe infection , severe malnutrition , unstable angina , congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III IV , ventricular arrhythmia , active ischemic heart disease , myocardial infarction within six month , chronic liver renal disease , active upper GI tract ulceration ) 4 . Patients preexist peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 . 5 . Evidence distant metastasis</criteria>
