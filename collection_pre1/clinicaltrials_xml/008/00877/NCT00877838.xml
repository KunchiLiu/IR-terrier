	<brief_title>Study Safety Effectiveness NXN-188 Acute Treatment Migraine Attacks With Aura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine new chemical entity 5HT agonist activity inhibition nitric oxide synthase enzyme ( NOS ) patient suffer migraine aura . Nitric oxide diverse role normal pathological process include regulation blood pressure , neurotransmission , macrophage defense system . NO synthesize three isoforms NOS enzyme : neuronal ( n ) , inducible ( ) endothelial ( e ) . Neuronal NOS ( nNOS ) find mainly neuronal tissue regulate change response sensitivity cellular plasticity ; iNOS find macrophage tissue , produce NO response stress injury one source inflammation ; eNOS find endothelial cell , responsible vascular homeostasis presume mechanism effect nitroglycerine therapy angina ; nitroglycerine NO donor . NXN-188 selectively inhibit nNOS . There ample scientific clinical evidence NO involved pathogenesis migraine pain , well pain state characterized central sensitization ( e.g. , neuropathic pain ) . NO donor trinitroglycerine induce headache follow migraine migraineurs without aura ; moreover , platelet nitrate ( signal increase NO ) increase migraine attack . In addition , increase NO level enhance pain response animal , include allodynia rat ; NO component several pathway pain system converge PNS CNS regulate activity numerous transmitter system ; NO involved central sensitization particularly involve NMDA calcium channel think major component formation neuropathic pain state Non-specific NOS inhibitor report relieve migraine chronic tension type headache human study . In animal , NOS inhibitor reduce pain-related behavior multiple neuropathic pain model spinal cord ischemia well reduce pain related behavior chemically-induced pain model , particularly secondary pain state . The development central sensitization course migraine attack suggest role neuronal isoform NOS enzyme . NXN-188 bind 5-HT1D 5-HT1B receptor potency similar sumatriptan ; also selectively bind nNOS level nNOS inhibition similar L-NMMA . NXN-188 devoid relevant eNOS inhibition vitro clone human enzyme assay ex vivo human coronary artery expect effective treat migraine inhibition nNOS enzyme without vasoconstrictive effect associate non-selective compound L-NMMA . The follow study conduct explore NXN-188 response subject migraine history aura . In study subject treat two attack migraine aura aura phase - placebo NXN-188 .</detailed_description>
