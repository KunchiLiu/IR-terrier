	<brief_summary>Marginal vitamin B6 deficiency , occur commonly worldwide , lead cellular deficiency coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate ( PLP ) . PLP coenzyme several phase one carbon ( 1C ) metabolism , array reaction one carbon unit acquire used reaction include nucleotide synthesis , regeneration methionine ( Met ) homocysteine ( Hcy ) , methylation many biological compound . 1C metabolism link transsulfuration pathway Hcy undergo PLP-dependent catabolism lead cysteine , whose availability govern formation antioxidant glutathione . Nutritional genetic condition impair 1C metabolism associate elevation plasma Hcy concentration increase risk vascular disease . It believe metabolic effect vitamin B6 deficiency pronounce follow protein intake vitamin B6-dependent pathway amino acid metabolism experience great substrate load . The human subject protocols study consist two distinct phase intend extend understand basic human 1C metabolism effect marginal vitamin B6 deficiency postprandial condition . Phase 1 investigate effect vitamin B6 nutrition PLP-dependent generation 1C unit glycine cleavage system synthesis glutathione . Phase 2 investigate dependence methionine metabolism vitamin B6 nutritional status , particular emphasis recycle Hcy Met . Each phase study involve 14 healthy , nutritionally adequate , young adult ( 7 male , 7 female ) undergo metabolite profile kinetic analysis use intravenously infuse stable isotopic tracer perform ~4-week period dietary vitamin B6 restriction . Subjects assign either Phase 1 Phase 2 , identical design except tracer analytical method use . We hypothesize vitamin B6 deficiency yield reduction postprandial rate homocysteine remethylation , generation 1C unit glycine , synthesis glutathione . The result study aid assessing consequence nutritional genetic variable affect human metabolism understand relationship vitamin B6 nutrition disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If volunteer study , come General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Shands Hospital screen visit . There approximately 27.5 mL blood ( 5 1/2 teaspoon ) take vein arm . This used test determine whether receive adequate amount vitamin B6 vitamin , analyze part genetic information certain blood cell relate body process nutrient , confirm general health . If vitamin B6 content blood high range need study , sometimes occur eat fortify food , might ask give another blood sample ( 2 teaspoon ) several week screen test repeat . You also ask question health detailed assessment regular diet carry . Your general health confirm take medical history , physical exam , standard blood test include liver , kidney , bone marrow function , cholesterol urine analysis . To take part study , must good health adequate nutritional status vitamin B6 vitamin . Because risk develop fetus inadequate vitamin B6 intake , pregnancy test conduct female three time study ( screen visit hospital admission ) woman participate study use protection prevent pregnancy study ; become pregnant release study . Once complete screening procedure ask eat meal prepare GCRC 2 day , participate procedure test effectively vitamin B6 function help body use certain amino acid . This involve give solution certain amino acid vein arm course 9 hour . On even procedure , report GCRC approximately 8:00 p.m. You spend night GCRC allow eat 9:00 p.m. On follow morning , give breakfast . You intravenous catheter place vein arm , one blood sample take throughout day , one amino acid solution give . You also ask breath ( one breath ) straw glass tube different time , amino acid solution give . Before start amino acid solution , blood sample ( 7 teaspoon ) take vein one arm . Then solution contain amino acid nucleotide pump slowly blood next 9-hour period . You allow eat normal food 9-hour period . However , give liquid nutritional formula drink hour day ( start first blood sample take ) . Approximately 14 blood sample ( 9 mL , less 2 teaspoon ) 8 breath sample take receive amino acid solution . In addition , 6 time day ask lie quietly 10 minute breathe special , clear hood measure metabolic rate ( rate body use energy ) . You remain GCRC entire 9-hour period , although able limited activity ( TV reading ) . At end 9-hour period , able go home resume activity . The following day resume eat meal prepare GCRC . While GCRC day 3 4 procedure , ask give two blood sample , one morning one evening , day 5 ask give one blood sample morning ( 2 teaspoon ) . The day discharge GCRC , ask eat , period approximately 4 week , diet contain reduced amount vitamin B6 limit amount caffeine ( coffee , tea , carbonated drink ) drink one two per day . Twice day approximately 4 week period come General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Shands Hospital eat breakfast evening meal . Also , weigh daily heart rate , respiration blood pressure monitor twice weekly . You give sack lunch consume wherever choose . To sure get adequate amount nutrient except vitamin study , give pill contain vitamin mineral supplement day . Once week ( come GCRC eat breakfast ) , two teaspoon blood take vein arm allow monitor vitamin B6 status . After finish approximately 4 week diet , participate procedure test effectively vitamin B6 function help body use certain amino acid . Again , involve give solution certain amino acid vein arm course 9 hour . As , report GCRC approximately 8:00 p.m. evening procedure . You spend night GCRC allow eat 9:00 p.m . The exact procedure carry first admission . A day prior second admission , GCRC receive diet , general health blood urine test collect do first admission . When amino acid solution completely give , approximately 9 hour , able go home resume activity . You ask return GCRC give blood sample day 3 , 4 , 5 procedure first admission . You finish study . You give 30 day supply vitamin mineral supplement take daily sure body get adequate amount vitamin B6 nutrient . After laboratory analysis blood sample study complete , agree , sample keep frozen storage possible future analysis nutrient genetic information relate body process nutrient . Please refer Addendum Blood Storage Future Testing attach .</detailed_description>
