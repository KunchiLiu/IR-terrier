	<brief_summary>Relative risk many psychiatric disorder differs dramatically male female . Early-onset disorder , autism , occur often male ; condition , schizophrenia , occur similar rate male female , sex differ expression . It hypothesize prevalence expression disorder related sex difference brain development . X-chromosome effect early exposure gonadal hormones strong candidate causal role . The aim research ( 1 ) characterize sex difference brain development birth age 2 ; ( 2 ) test whether brain development alter infant Turner syndrome , well-defined genetic disorder result partial complete loss one sex chromosome . To address aim 1 , high resolution MRI , include diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , use characterize sex difference brain development birth age 2 longitudinal cohort 250 child . To address aim 2 , high resolution MRI , include DTI , use compare brain development 70 infant Turner syndrome ( X monosomy ) match control aim 1 . The investigator hypothesize sex difference gray white matter development white matter maturation assess DTI present first 2 year life child TS exhibit abnormal gray white matter development neonatal period .</brief_summary>
