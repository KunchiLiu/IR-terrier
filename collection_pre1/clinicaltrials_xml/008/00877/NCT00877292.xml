	<brief_summary>The study examine sensitivity specificity circulate cell-free nucleic acid test ( DNA/RNA ) identify Down syndrome 10 week 21 week 6 day gestation . In addition , new test may use identify trisomy 13 18 part complete laboratory develop test . We hypothesize new circulate cell-free fetal NA-based test accurately precisely measure specific fetal marker maternal circulation measurement lead ability noninvasively identify high sensitivity specificity , fetal chromosome abnormality , Down syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The RNA study observational trial whose primary aim document performance ( sensitivity specificity ) one laboratory develop test ( LDT ) use circulate cell-free fetal nucleic acid maternal plasma identify Down syndrome . Multiple test modality pursue , include massively parallel sequence utilizing differential methylation . The population study woman already diagnostic test ( e.g. , amniocentesis , CVS ) 10 week 21 week 6 day gestation , whose pregnancy high risk Down syndrome . The woman provide informed consent . The karyotype provide gold standard LDT test judged . Samples karyotypes collect 25 prenatal diagnostic center around world test several laboratory United States . The secondary aim develop nucleic acid sample bank allow documentation subsequent improvement new methodology identify fetal aneuploidy use circulate cell-free fetal nucleic acid .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pregnant woman 10 week 21 week 6 day gestation undergoing diagnostic procedure ( i.e. , chorionic villus sample amniocentesis ) karyotype analysis , average , high prevalence Down syndrome ( 1:30 1:50 ) . Three main source pregnancy screen positive : 1. combine test 10 13 week ( NT , PAPPA hCG ) 2. second trimester quadruple test 15 18 week gestation 3. integrate screening ( PAPPA quadruple test , without NT ) . Variations integrated test sequential test also acceptable . Other , less common high risk group would woman diagnostic test maternal age 38 year old delivery , pregnancy abnormal ultrasound highly suggestive chromosome abnormality ( e.g. , major heart defect , clenched fist ) , woman inherit form Down syndrome ( Robertsonian translocation ) . Nonpregnant woman woman relatively low risk Down syndrome baby .</criteria>
