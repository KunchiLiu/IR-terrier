	<brief_title>The Rocky Sleep Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Infant behavioural sleep problem affect 50 % infant , persist , contribute adverse developmental outcome . Persistent short night sleep period 5-to 29 month age associate hyperactivity inattention , low ability cognitive task old child . Sleep problem infant also associate parental stress , fatigue family tension , maternal depression . Health care professional often fail recognize treat infant sleep problem 40 book many website provide conflict advice . Interventions direct change parent ' cognition behaviour reduce infant night wake reduce parent ' distress ; however , inexpensive , short term group intervention improve infant sleep problem reduce effect conflict advice need . Parents ' knowledge infant sleep affect behaviours bedtime response night wake . Combined cognitive-behavioural approach modify factor improve outcome . Research Design : The study randomize control trial aim 6 8-month-old infant wake night cry , stratification community health centre blind analysis actigraphic/sleep diary data Primary Question : In population parent infants behavioural sleep problem parent randomize cognitive-behavioural sleep intervention compare parent randomize group cognitive-behavioural safety intervention less likely : ) identify child severe sleep problem , b ) child wake few average 2 time per night 5 night actigraphy ? Inclusion criterion : Biological adoptive parent : 1 ) read speak English , 2 ) access telephone , 3 ) two parent single parent family . Infants : 1 ) healthy , 2 ) 5.5 8 month age , 3 ) screen identified sleep problem . Exclusion criterion : Infants : 1 ) organic cause sleep disruption , 2 ) developmental disability , 3 ) chronic neurological respiratory condition . Parents 1 ) diagnose depression , 2 ) diagnose sleep problem , 3 ) permanent night shift work . Sample size : The team randomize 240 family infant control experimental group . The Intervention : We recruit family program community 5 health centre , Vancouver Coastal Health Website , Newborn Hotline . Prior randomization , experimental control group screen infant sleep problem provide baseline data questionnaire ( sleep cognition , depression , sleep quality , fatigue ) , infant sleep diary actigraphy . The intervention high ecological validity , public health nurse offer group format 1 teach session four phone call community set . The experimental group control group receive short 2 hour teaching session change cognition behaviour manage infant sleep problem infant safety respectively . For experimental group , cognition include thought normal infant sleep developmental appropriateness infant self-soothing . Both group receive two week telephone support twice weekly . Primary Outcome : A significant infant sleep disturbance measure composite measure , consist either parent reporting severe sleep problem OR mean actigraphic wake great 2 per night average 5 night 6 week post-teaching session . The control group receive sleep pamphlet 6 week experimental group receive safety pamphlet . Analysis : All analysis follow intent-to-treat principle . We apply Fisher 's exact test compare outcome prevalence primary composite severe problem wake average 2 per night 5 night group . We assess variation health unit use logistic regression , incorporate term health unit health unit treatment interaction . Significance : The trial complete 30 month potential build capacity community health nurse offer systematic program manage infant sleep problem .</detailed_description>
