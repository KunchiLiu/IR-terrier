	<detailed_description>Pulses , include yellow pea , readily available low-cost commodity gain considerable momentum functional ingredient possess health benefit , food material high fiber , protein , antioxidant , low fat . As incidence rate type II diabetes continue climb , new novel ingredient produce low-glycemic food product demand . Consumption whole pulse show low post-prandial glycemic response ( Jenkins others 1983 ) , however , addition food often produce unfavorable sensory characteristic . To date , study examine feasibility produce food product contain pulse-derived ingredient reduce post-prandial glycemic response , low glycemic index ( GI ) time possess sensory quality appeal consumer . Since yellow pea readily available relatively inexpensive , promising candidate use novel ingredient development low-glycemic , consumer-friendly functional food . The objective present study first determine post-prandial glycemic response GI novel food contain whole yellow pea flour ( WYPF ) functional ingredient . The second objective determine acceptability sensory characteristic WYPF food product .</detailed_description>
