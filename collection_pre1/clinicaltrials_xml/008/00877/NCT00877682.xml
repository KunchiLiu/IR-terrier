	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn use cryotherapy treat part prostate contain cancer effective treatment prostate cancer . The safety treatment also study . Researchers also want learn treat part prostate cancer cause less impact quality life type therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostate Conformal Cryotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryotherapy ( also call cryoablation ) FDA approve treatment prostate cancer . It involve place multiple needle within prostate freezing prostate , destroy cancerous normal prostate tissue control manner . It possible treat less whole prostate freeze area prostate know contain cancer . For study , cryotherapy perform way similar whole prostate cryotherapy , except entire prostate frozen . For study , portion prostate prostate cancer upper half opposite side location cancer prostate treat . All area cancer may treat . Cryotherapy : Cryotherapy perform general anesthetic operating room . An ultrasound probe insert rectum monitor tissue freezing . A urethral warmer insert bladder penis maintain health urethra . Quality-of-Life Questionnaires : You complete quality-of-life questionnaire prostate biopsy , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 month cryotherapy . The questionnaire ask general health urinary , bowel , sexual function . The questionnaire take 15 minute complete time . Digital Rectal Exams PCA3 Testing : Before cryotherapy biopsy Months 6 , 18 36 digital rectal exam ( feel prostate anus ) check status disease . You also digital rectal exams Months 48 60 check status disease . Urine collect digital rectal exam . This sample test PCA3 , associated prostate cancer . Prostate Biopsies : You additional prostate biopsy 6 , 18 , 36 month cryotherapy . About 12 biopsy sample collect time location screen biopsy . If rise PSA level doctor think necessary , doctor discus need additional biopsy Months 48 60 . This investigational study . Cryotherapy FDA approve destruction tissue , include prostate tissue . For treatment prostate cancer , commonly use treat entire prostate gland . This study investigational part prostate gland treat , instead entire gland . Partial organ treatment cryotherapy common treatment kidney , liver , skin lesion . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically identify adenocarcinoma prostate minimum 6 core prostate biopsy . 2 . Serum PSA &lt; /= 10 ng/mL prostate biopsy 3 . Less 50 % sample one side prostate positive prostate cancer . 4 . No great 50 % single core total length occupy prostate cancer . 5 . No dominant Gleason 4 component . ( e.g . ; 4+X allow , X+4 eligible ) 6 . No Gleason 5 component ( primary , secondary tertiary ) . 7 . Subjects may contralateral positive prostate biopsy single core within eligibility biopsy long involvement core 2mm less Gleason 4 Gleason 5 pattern exists . This consider NonDominant ( Contralateral ) Tumor Burden exclusionary . 8 . In case confirmatory biopsy fail sample tumor , patient allow continue therapeutic phase use laterality information obtain eligibility biopsy . 1 . Medical History Concurrent Disease investigator mind place patient significant preoperative risk investigator feel therapy appropriate . Investigator believe subject unwilling unable comply study protocol requirement . 2 . AUASI ( American Urologic Association Symptom Index ) score &gt; /=20 3 . Active urinary tract infection 4 . Active treatment anticoagulant/antiplatelet agent safely stop time prostate biopsy cryotherapy . 5 . Medical surgical castration initiate eligibility biopsy . 6 . Patient unable provide inform consent . 7 . Patients undergo base line bone scan prior cryoablation evaluate region abnormal uptake therapeutic intervention . Metastatic disease bone scintigraphy exclusionary . Bone scan perform within 12 month prior study entry use study base line purpose need repeat , unless clinically indicate .</criteria>
