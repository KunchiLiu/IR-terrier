	<detailed_description>Regardless survival benefit propose treatment affords patient , result poor QOL , may consider reasonable option . To assess critical issue , QOL survey develop determine post-therapy impact give treatment . In prostate cancer , one widely use validate survey instrument Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( EPIC ) .8 It contain 4 primary domain elicit detail regard urinary , bowel , sexual , hormonal function . The EPIC questionnaire widely apply , although administer patient undergo neoadjuvant investigational therapy prior radical prostatectomy HRCLPC . Obtaining information important counseling patient consider similar trial future since reflect long-term outcome functional recovery mental healthâ€”two key concern patient decide whether enter clinical trial . Furthermore , researcher able stratify outcome base specific treatment arm possibly determine optimize outcome reduce negative impact give therapy . This cross-sectional descriptive study QOL prostatectomy patient receive neoadjuvant treatment . Anticipated 131 patient receive brief survey complete return mail M. D.
