	<brief_summary>Experimental design overview : The propose project prospective experimental study design . Independent old adult ( age 65 year old old ) suffer minor balance problem willing participate study test well-established measure technique balance gait 4 week balance training program use `` Self Mobility Improvement Elderly Counteracting Falls '' system ( SMILING system ) . The study design randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) , cross , single blind study design 30 subject randomly allocate experimental control group switch group 4 week intervention . Random sequence generation perform staff member interact subject balance-testing session . Subjects inform randomly assign one two group , receive gait training program . The staff member administers train program member research team aware subject ' group allocation . A 'blinded ' research assistant administer balance test perform data process involves subjective judgment . Scripts use test ensure subject receive instruction .
