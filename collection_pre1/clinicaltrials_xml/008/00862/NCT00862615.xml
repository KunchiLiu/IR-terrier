	<brief_summary>This project aim assess impact chronic micro-inflammation age-related loss muscle ( sarcopenia ) bone ( osteopenia ) . The hypothesis chronic micro-inflammation oxidative stress , prevalence increase age , may participate pathogenesis sarcopenia osteopenia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order explore effect moderate chronic inflammation skeletal muscle function protein metabolism bone status , two group 16 subject select accord inflammatory status ie non-inflamed versus micro-inflamed . The volunteer sample twice week 0 week 6 order quantify plasma concentration C reactive protein ( CRP ) use ultra sensitive assay . The subject exhibit CRP low 1 mg/l twice include non-inflamed group subject exhibit CRP high 3 low 15 mg/l include micro-inflamed group . During two week metabolic study dietary intake , DEXA , muscle function , VO2 max biomarkers bone remodelling assess . Volunteers submit diet control protein content , 4 day ( 1 g protein/kg/day 30 kcal/kg/day ) metabolic investigation . One day , urine collect metabolomics . On day metabolic investigation , overnight fast , blood sample collect albumin , fibrinogen , inflammatory cytokine adipokine determination . Then , subject perfuse L- [ 1-13C ] leucine 8 hour ( post absorptive sate post prandial satte ) expire gas blood sample take , well 2 muscle biopsy . Isotopic enrichment expire gas , plasma cetoiscaproate free protein-bound leucine muscle measure determine proteolysis proteosynthesis rate muscle protein .</detailed_description>
