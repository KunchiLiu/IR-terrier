	<brief_summary>Pre-clinical study demonstrate memantine decrease neuronal toxicity associate excessive glutamate release calcium overload neuron . Previous study show memantine help treat symptom Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . In AD , rate brain tissue loss , atrophy , fast normal age seem go hand hand symptom disease . This suggest memantine treatment AD could provide symptomatic improvement neuro-protective effect . The purpose study show whether memantine , addition provide symptomatic benefit , slow rate brain atrophy assess use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Evaluating Effects Memantine Brain Atrophy Patients With Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate effect memantine rate brain atrophy compare placebo patient AD ( moderate severity ) 1-year period . This multinational , randomised , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled , fixed-dose study ( 20 mg memantine ) . The study also include secondary imaging , cognitive behavioural measure .</detailed_description>
