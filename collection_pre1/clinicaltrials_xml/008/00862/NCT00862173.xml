	<detailed_description>Brain metastasis occur 30-50 % lung adenocarcinoma ( LAC ) patient confer bad prognosis quality life . A good selection in-risk patient accurate biomarker could improve benefit prophylactic therapy . The aim prospective study determine gene-expression profile primary tumor associate brain metastasis ( BM ) evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient advanced LAC . Introduction.Lung cancer first cause cancer death world . Eighty five percent patient diagnose yearly non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Despite effort , innovation , progress diagnosis treatment patient , overall survival ( OS ) 5 year diagnosis 15 % . The central nervous system ( CNS ) devastate frequent site metastasis development NSCLC . The reported incidence CNS metastasis patient NSCLC 54 % OS &lt; 1 year diagnosis . Age , clinical stage , gender , initial treatment period report CNS metastasis development-related factor patient NSCLC . We recently describe high carcino-embryonic antigen ( CEA ) serum level ( &gt; 40 ng/dL ) diagnosis adenocarcinoma histological type independently associate high risk brain metastasis development . However , due lack specificity report factor , require detect biomarkers predict brain metastasis patient NSCLC objective prevent development.Metastasis process complex involve well-defined molecular-printed step , invasion , vascular intravasation , implantation grow new specific organ . Higher motility , capacity extracellular matrix degradation , immune system evasion , adhesion new specific organ tumoral cell characteristic require metastasize . In particular , molecular event brain metastasis development primary NSCLC even al describe , currently well understood . Gene-expression microarray allow analyze expression change thousand gene simultaneously , distinguish alter expression neoplastic cell gene normal tissue . Identification biological pattern , pharmacological molecular target , biomarkers prognosis evaluation therapeutic response , even specific neoplasia classification result gene-expression microarray study hematological , breast NSCLC cancer . Determination tobacco-smoke transcriptional change oncogenes antioncogenes determine use microarray data . A gene-expression profile 20 gene differentiate health lung tissue lung cancer high specificity histopathologic evaluation . Furthermore , gene-expression microarray study develop predict survival recurrence early NSCLC stage identification patient could benefit adjuvant therapy , promise result.The objective study identify gene-expression profile primary lung adenocarcinoma relate brain metastasis , evaluate prospective manner prognostic significance survival patient advance disease.Experimental Design These study use clinical , longitudinal , prospective , observational , analytical cohort selection nonprobabalistic-type sample.In prospective manner , January 2009 June 2011 , patient admit Institute confirm histologically confirm stage IIIb IV LAC eligible study inclusion . Analyzed clinical variable comprise smoke history , gender , age , general condition brain metastasis development . Primary tumor core-biopsy perform prior treatment snap-frozen . A single pathologist evaluate tumor . Standard platinum-based chemotherapy employ patient . All patient submit Magnetic resonance imaging ( RM ) evidence presence absence brain metastasis ( BM ) . During follow-up , carry Computed tomography ( CT ) brain stem purpose . Preliminary statistical analysis perform utilizing Student , Mann-Whitney U , χ2 , Fisher exact test . Once study end , conduct logistic-regression multivariate analysis . Global survival time analyze Kaplan-Meier technique , comparison among group perform log-rank test . High Risk characteristic gender , histology , age relate great frequency development metastasis CNS analyzed.The study carry accord principle ClinicalTrials accept INCan Bioethical Scientific Committees ( reference number INCAN/CC/067/08 ) . A collaboration agreement sign INMEGEN approve within Health Research Sectorial Fund ( FSIS ) CONACyT-México ( SALUD-2009-01-115552 ) . Selection obtain tumor biopsy depend characteristic patient tumor . The biopsy could take mean CT guide tru-cut needle , open thoracoscopy , bronchoscopy optic fiber . Each tumor sample divide two ; one sample analyze INCan Pathology Service ( sole observer blind clinical variable ) histological clinical diagnosis quantification neoplastic cellularity , remain half immediately store ‒80°C processing RNA extraction.RNA Extraction : RNA extract frozen tumor biopsy , weight cryofractured liquid nitrogen . Extraction purification total RNA tissue ( 5 mg tissue ) procedure do use RNeasy Micro Kit ( QIAGEN , Germany ) ( cat . 217084 ) . RNA analyze use Agilent 6000 Chip ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , C.A. ) . RNA quality consist obtention RNA Integrity Number ( RIN ) &gt; 8 . RNA sample choose microarray analysis quality concentration obtain purpose . Microarray Expression : We use Affymetrix platform , consist situ synthesize oligonucleotide microarray . The GeneChip® employ Human Gene 1.0 ST Array , allow analyze expression 28,869 different gene ( transcript represent 26 disperse probe along entire length , present human genome , cover 99 % sequence present RefSeq data bank GenBank . The Two-Cycle Target Labeling protocol follow suggested manufacturer describe succinctly follow show graphically figure end Materials Methods section : Total RNA ( 100 ng/uL ) retro-transcribed use T7-Oligo ( dT ) Promoter primer synthesis reaction first complementary DNA chain ( cDNA ) . After treatment RNAase H , second cDNA chain synthesize , serve template Transcription reaction vitro ( TVI ) . The first TVI reaction carry T7 polymerase RNA unmarked ribonucleotides amplification complementary RNA ( cRNA ) . These cRNAs retro-transcribed synthesis step first cDNA chain second cycle use random primer . Subsequently , T7-Oligo ( dT ) -Promoter primer employ synthesis second chain cDNA , generate double-helix cDNA template contains promoter T7 sequence . This cDNA amplify marked second TVI reaction use T7 polymerase DNA mixture ribonucleotides/biotinylated nucleotide analog . These target biotinylated cDNAs clean , fragment , hybridize GeneChip® expression microarrays . After hybridization , fluorescent mark perform streptavidin-phycoerythrin biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody amplifier system . Fluorescence detect high-resolution laser scanner.Reading Analysis Expression Microarrays : We utilize Expression Console Affymetrix software evaluate quality microarrays correct background signal standard method [ 49,50 ] . For signal intensity-level normalization , employ `` non-supervised '' method , use data experiment 's microarrays ; allow u render comparable among , microarray assay evaluates gene expression mean fluorescence intensity ; thus , important establish cut-off point consider under- overexpression . Once data normalize , final stage resume value probe exist gene microarray sole value , gene 's expression level . For detection differentially express gene , construct linear model include experiment 's microarrays simultaneously ; manner , able analyze contrast group A ( patient metastasis CNS follow-up period ) group B ( patient without metastasis CNS period ) . As internal control , prove differential expression gene RT-PCR real time . Results represent block heat map table , active gene list along functional description . For risk-profile validation , perform leave-one-out cross validation method postulate second cohort objective .</detailed_description>
