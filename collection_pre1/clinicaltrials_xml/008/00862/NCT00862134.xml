	<brief_summary>The current understanding PR104 justify evaluation PR104 docetaxel subject Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . These include : - Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 ( AKR1C3 ) . NSCLC show express high level AKR1C3 one half tumor test . Subjects high level AKR1C3 increase activation PR104 within tumor . - Hypoxia . NSCLC demonstrate tumor hypoxia base direct tumor measurement ( oxygen electrode ) hypoxic positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging . Tumor hypoxia NSCLC sufficient activate PR104 active metabolite PR104H PR104M . - Preclinical data . The use docetaxel PR104 alone combination preclinical model demonstrate activity PR104 single agent supraadditive activity PR104 docetaxel use combination . - Manageable toxicity . PR104 docetaxel Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) combine prior phase I study . A Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) identify major toxicity combination understood . The current study provide estimate activity PR104 subject NSCLC . This information prove valuable defining future clinical development PR104 , determine PR104 sufficient activity NSCLC warrant large phase III registration study indication . Primary objective • Estimate response rate ( RR ) PR104/docetaxel Secondary objectives - Evaluate survival - Evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) - Evaluate time progression ( TTP ) - Evaluate safety - Evaluate pharmacokinetics PR104 metabolites - Evaluate pharmacokinetics docetaxel - Evaluate tumor hypoxia use 18F-fluoromisonidazole ( 18F-MISO ) PET image - Collect diagnostic biopsy sample determination AKR1C3 - Collect plasma sample assessment potential biomarkers tumor hypoxia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized , Multi-center , Open-label , Study PR104 Versus PR104/Docetaxel Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized phase II , multi-center , open-label , study docetaxel versus docetaxel/PR104 . Following informed consent , subject undergo baseline evaluation history , physical exam , blood work disease assessment . Selected subject undergo PET image F18 fluoromisonidazole ( F18-FMISO ) Fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) assessment hypoxia glucose metabolism , pharmacokinetics PR104 . Subjects randomize arm 1 consist docetaxel , 75 mg/m^2 , administer intravenously ( IV ) , every 21 day ( approve dose schedule ) arm 2 consist docetaxel , 60 mg/m^2 PR104 770 mg/m^2 , IV , every 21 day . Subjects randomize PR104/docetaxel receive prophylactic G-CSF . One cycle 21 day duration . Subjects evaluate weekly . A disease assessment perform every six week . Subjects progression remove study . Subjects response stable disease may continue study consider beneficial physician .</detailed_description>
