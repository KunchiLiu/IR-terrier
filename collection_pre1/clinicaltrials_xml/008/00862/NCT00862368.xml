	<brief_summary>Parents Asthmatics Quit Smoking ( PAQS-2 ) randomize control trial smoking cessation intervention parent smoke . Children either diagnosis asthma ( asthma emergency within past 3 month ) healthy ( medical condition past 3 month ) . The study intervention aim help parent ( caregiver ) quit smoke reduce child 's second hand smoke exposure . Participants receive 2 home counseling session asthma education ( child asthma ) , child wellness ( healthy child ) smoke cessation counseling ( include objective feedback much smoke child expose ) . Parents child asthma randomize 2 group ; one group receive 6 counsel phone call focus motivate smoke cessation second round feedback smoke exposure ( Enhanced ) . The group receive six call focus asthma ( PAM asthma group ) child wellness ( Healthy group ) . We 2 primary aim . First , explore `` teachable moment '' compare quit rate parent child asthma parent healthy child . We hypothesize Asthma group would significantly great quit rate Healthy group low level environmental tobacco smoke home . We also hypothesize parent smoke child asthma would great change variable associate teachable moment compare parent smoke healthy child . -- - The second primary aim focus parent child asthma . We assess effectiveness add telephone smoke cessation counsel 2 home counseling visit . For , compare 2 group randomized subject : receive 6 counsel call feedback smoke exposure ( PAM-Enhanced ) receive 6 counsel call focus asthma education ( PAM-Asthma ) . We hypothesize PAM-Enhanced group would significantly great quit rate PAM-Asthma group , low likelihood smoking relapse , low level environmental tobacco smoke home . We also explore hypothesized role precaution effectiveness ( i.e . quit smoke associate benefit self child ) self-efficacy quit mediator effectiveness PAM-Enhanced/Asthma .

	<brief_title>Sustaining Smoking Cessation Smokers With Kids With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma one common pediatric disease affect 6.7 million child adolescent ( Akinbami et al 2009 ) . Asthma lead cause hospitalization , emergency department visit , school absence , activity restriction youth ( ALA , 2011 ; Taylor et al. , 1992 ; Weiss et al. , 1992 ) . Smoking lead cause preventable morbidity mortality 443,000 death attributable smoke year ( CDC , 2012 ) . This study two aim build result previous study ( Borrelli et al. , 2002 ) : 1 ) characterize cognitive , affective , behavioral change associate Teachable Moment ( TM ) , 2 ) test whether extend intervention augments quit rate prevents relapse previous theory-based smoking cessation intervention low-income caregiver child asthma ( Borrelli et al. , 2002 ) . In study , view provision objectivefeedback child 's exposure ETS necessary link caregiver 's smoking child 's asthma . It hypothesize provide feedback within context heighten awareness child 's health constitutes teachable moment . The first aim study examine , two population , effect intervention base The Precaution Adoption Model ( PAM ) ( Weinstein , 1988 ) , Motivational Interviewing biomarker feedback ( smoker 's CO level child 's ETS exposure ) use increase risk perception self child . Our population : 1 ) smoker whose child asthma acute exacerbation ( PAM-Asthma ) 2 ) smoker healthy child ( PAM-Healthy ) . The second aim test effect increase intensity original theory-based intervention , PAM , add telephone counseling focus motivate sustain quit attempt . Though previous study demonstrate excellent quit rate short term ( 2 month follow-up ) , dramatic decrease abstinence 6 month . Therefore , caregiver kid asthma randomize either 1 ) PAM-Asthma : original intervention plus six contact control call focus child 's asthma child wellness ( diet , exercise , safety , etc . ) 2 ) PAM-Enhanced/Asthma : original intervention plus six counsel call focus child 's asthma , motivate quit attempt , prevent relapse . Precaution effectiveness ( belief quit improve one 's child 's health ) self-efficacy primary intervention target PAM-Enhanced/Asthma call . A . Primary Aims Aim 1 : To assess cognitive , affective , behavioral change involve `` teachable moment '' examine receive PAM child asthma ( PAM-Asthma ) vs. receive PAM healthy child ( PAM-Healthy ) . Hypothesis 1.1 : PAM-Asthma , follow-ups , significantly great quit rate PAM-Healthy ( 7-day point prevalence abstinence , 30 day abstinence ) low level ETS home . Hypothesis 1.2 : Parents smoke child asthma ( PAM-Asthma ) great change variable hypothesize associate teachable moment ( perceive risk , affect , self-concept ) vs. parent smoke healthy child ( PAM-Healthy ) . We also explore mediational role factor outcome . Aim 2 : Among parent child asthma , assess effectiveness add telephone counsel previously test intervention , PAM , ( PAM-Enhanced/Asthma ) vs. PAM plus contact control ( PAM-Asthma ) . Hypothesis 2.1 . PAM-Enhanced/Asthma , follow-ups , significantly great quit rate PAM-Asthma ( 7 day point prevalence abstinence , 30 day abstinence ) , low likelihood relapse , low level ETS home . Hypothesis 2.2 . Explore hypothesized role precaution effectiveness ( i.e. , quit smoking associate benefit self child ) self-efficacy quit mediator effectiveness ( PAM-Enhanced/Asthma ) . We also plan explore effect important moderating variable ( demographic , social support , depress mood ) smoking outcome . B . Secondary Aims : Aim 3 : To assess difference PAM-Enhanced/Asthma PAM-Asthma group asthma morbidity health care utilization among child asthma . Hypothesis 3.1 : PAM-Enhanced/Asthma low level functional morbidity due asthma ( i.e. , few symptom less activity limitation ) vs. PAM-Asthma . Hypothesis 3.2 : PAM-Enhanced/Asthma low level health care utilization include few hospital day asthma , few urgent care visit asthma , few prescription refill quick-relief asthma medication vs. PAM-Asthma . C. Study Design This three group design 2 group comparison . In order test Aim 1 ( Teachable Moment ) smoker kid asthma ( PAM-Asthma ) compare smoker healthy kid ( PAM-Healthy ) cognitive , affective , behavioral change immediately receive feedback child 's smoke exposure . Both group receive home-based smoking cessation counseling ( PAM ) , six contact control call focus child wellness asthma education . In order test Aim 2 , improve sustain smoke cessation rate , smoker kid asthma randomly assign receive either PAM + six contact control call ( PAM-Asthma ) PAM + six counsel call focus build precaution effectiveness self-efficacy ( PAM-Enhanced ) .</detailed_description>
