	<brief_title>Sitagliptin Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) increasingly use source stem cell patient blood cancer need allogeneic stem cell transplant ( transplant stem cell another person ) suitably match donor . The advantage UCB ( 1 ) associate less risk transmit infection donor , ( 2 ) safely give even completely match compare bone marrow blood stem cell , ( 3 ) much quickly available unrelated donor bone marrow blood stem cell . While commonly use transplantation child , UCB increasingly use adult . However , large child , relatively small stem cell dose UCB major limitation transplantation adult , engraftment delay . This study investigate whether drug sitagliptin use increase speed engraftment adult receive UCB transplantation , overcome limitation small stem cell dos associate umbilical cord blood . Sitagliptin drug give tablet form recently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment certain patient diabetes mellitus ( disease result high blood sugar ) . Sitagliptin give normal healthy volunteer diabetic patient find safe well-tolerated . The drug improve control blood sugar diabetic inhibit enzyme call `` CD26/DPP-IV . '' Recent study Indiana University ( center ) show enzyme play important role way transplant stem cell find way bone marrow engraft . Transplant study mice find inhibit CD26/DPP-IV significantly increase engraftment stem cell . Based study , believe drug inhibit CD26/DPP-IV , sitagliptin , may also increase engraftment patient receive clinical stem cell transplant .</detailed_description>
