	<brief_summary>This research intend explore new approach therapy breast cancer recur skin . The treatment , know continuous low-irradiance photodynamic therapy , CLIPT , show great promise animal study . The investigator goal evaluate CLIPT people , use novel light delivery system , assess side effect benefit treat cancer . The investigator goal develop safe , effective therapy give doctor 's office possibly home .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Using Photodynamic Therapy Light Therapy Patients With Chest Wall Progression Breast Cancer Satellite Metastases Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal research conduct Phase I clinical study ass toxicity , safety feasibility novel cancer treatment , Continuous Low Irradiance Photodynamic Therapy ( CLIPT ) . This research provide translation recent promising preclinical work human subject recurrent breast cancer . BACKGROUND : Patients develop post-mastectomy chest wall skin recurrence fail conventional radiation therapy therapeutic option result durable control . High-irradiance photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) show efficacy patient chest-wall progression breast cancer fail radiation , surgery , chemotherapy . However clinical application severely limit currently employ method PDT result virtually 100 % patient develop skin necrosis , large area full-thickness ulceration , slow healing chronic wound pain . In rat rabbit-brain tumor model , reduce laser irradiance increase exposure time achieve similar total fluence ( fluence = irradiance x time ) standard PDT , avoids tissue necrosis induce apoptosis tumor normal tissue . HYPOTHESIS : Low dose-rate ( low irradiance ) PDT may reduce eliminate skin toxicity enable treatment skin/subcutaneous chest wall metastases skin previously subject ionizing radiation . SPECIFIC AIMS : 1 ) determine fluence CLIPT result toxicity ( maximum tolerate dose ) , define ulceration necrosis previously irradiate skin ( non-tumor bearing skin within prior ionize radiation field ) normal skin , 2 ) evaluate feasibility , ergonomics safety perform CLIPT via proprietary electronically targetable fiber-optic `` patch '' place directly tumor-bearing , surround uninvolved previously irradiate skin normal integument 3 ) study tumor-bearing integument clinical response therapy measure complete , partial response CLIPT . STUDY DESIGN : We perform standard dose ( laser fluence ) escalation trial ( hold drug level constant ) human subject post-mastectomy skin recurrence fail ionize radiation therapy ass toxicity previously irradiate normal integument . POTENTIAL OUTCOMES &amp; BENEFITS : Therapeutic option post-mastectomy cutaneous recurrence fail conventional radiotherapy limit . If pre-clinical result replicate human subject , Phase II study evaluate CLIPT would warrant . The long-term goal develop unobtrusive , large-area CLIPT system form fiber-optically woven `` garment '' worn patient outside hospital setting repeat extended period without cause skin breakdown pain .</detailed_description>
