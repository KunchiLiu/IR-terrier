	<brief_summary>The purpose study test hypotheses ethnic genetic difference mechanisms magnitude hypocaloric weight loss aerobic exercise affect body composition , glucose , lipid , muscle adipose tissue metabolism overweight , insulin resistant postmenopausal woman . This tested trial compare effect weight loss vs. aerobic exercise plus weight loss glucose , lipid , fat muscle metabolism overweight African American Caucasian postmenopausal woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The finding study also determine whether racial difference whole body cellular mechanism aerobic exercise training weight loss affect glucose , lipid , fat muscle metabolism African-American vs. Caucasian postmenopausal woman . The result also may provide rationale target specific population woman might improve glucose , lipid , fat muscle metabolism addition exercise dietary restriction weight loss alone reduce risk type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . The study protocol consist follow phase : Phase 1—Recruitment screening . Phase 2—Weight dietary stabilization 4-6 week , participant teach principle American Heart Association `` Heart Healthy '' diet provide food consume prior test . Phase 3—Participants undergo research test include glucose clamp fat biopsy . Phase 4—Participants select either weight loss , exercise plus weight loss . The behavior diet modification weight loss session hold registered dietitian 1 hour week 6-9 month recommend caloric intake participant adjust dietitian elicit weight loss approximately 0.2-0.4 kg per week . In addition weight loss session , participant select aerobic exercise plus weight loss intervention exercise Baltimore Geriatric Research Education Clinical Center ( GRECC ) exercise facility 3 time week 6-9 month use treadmill aerobic exercise equipment . Exercise session begin low level VO2max ( maximal oxygen consumption ) progress duration intensity participant able exercise 75 % VO2max 45 minute . Phase 5—Following 6-9 month long-term weight loss exercise plus weight loss , participant undergo long-term metabolic testing .</detailed_description>
