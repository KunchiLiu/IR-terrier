	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Metabolic Responses Mixed Meal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To begin examine question recruit healthy endurance-trained ( high fit , HF ) normally active ( average fit , AF ) subject . It well characterize chronic endurance training result enhance peripheral insulin sensitivity . Therefore , rationale inclusion two healthy subject group , distinct difference insulin sensitivity , would allow u investigate enhanced insulin sensitivity influence insulin-mediated change central sympathetic outflow . Direct measurement central sympathetic outflow skeletal muscle ( i.e. , MSNA ) record , mixed meal use physiological method evoke robust sustain increase MSNA , primarily attribute insulin . We hypothesize HF subject would great MSNA response , give plasma insulin concentration , follow consumption mixed meal ( i.e. , great central insulin sensitivity ) .</detailed_description>
