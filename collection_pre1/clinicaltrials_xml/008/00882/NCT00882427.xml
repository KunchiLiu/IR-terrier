	<brief_summary>Hyperglycaemia commonly find critically ill patient . Clinical study demonstrate tight blood glucose control medical surgical ICU patient result significant good outcome patient . Based emerge clinical evidence , increase effort worldwide maintain strict glycaemic control critically ill patient . However , achieve goal require extensive nursing effort , include frequent bedside glucose monitoring implementation complex intensive insulin infusion protocol . A fully automate algorithm may help overcome limitation exclude intuitive intervention integrate relevant clinical data decision-making process . This study investigate performance eMPC algorithm adjust target range 4.4 - 8.3 mmol/L line Surviving Sepsis guideline .</brief_summary>
