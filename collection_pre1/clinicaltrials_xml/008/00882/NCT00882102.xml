	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn 5-aza-2 deoxycytidine ( decitabine ) give combination Mylotarg ( gemtuzumab ozogamicin ) help control Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) Myelofibrosis ( MF ) . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( H-R MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Gemtuzumab ozogamicin design attach Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 3 ( CD33 ) , certain protein often find leukemia cell , cause die . Decitabine design damage Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( genetic material ) cell , may cause cancer cell die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive decitabine needle vein 1 1/2 hour Days 1-5 cycle . You also receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin vein 1 hour receive decitabine Day 5 4-8 week cycle . During Cycle 1 , bone marrow test do 2 week receive first study drug treatment show abnormal leukemia cell , receive another treatment decitabine vein 1 1/2 hour 5 day . Gemtuzumab may cause allergic reaction , nausea , vomit . To help decrease risk side effect , receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) , acetaminophen , meperidine , hydrocortisone . You may receive drug vein , mouth day get gemtuzumab ozogamicin . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask experienced side effect list drug may take . During Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw least 1 time week routine test . If doctor think necessary , may ask additional blood drawn . On Day 1 every cycle , performance status record vital sign measure . On Days 1-5 Cycle 1 , vital sign measure . Between Days 12 16 Cycle 1 , bone marrow aspirate diagnosis AML high-risk MDS check status disease . This test may delay doctor think remission . During Cycles 2-3 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test least 2 time month . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . During Cycles 4 beyond , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test least 1 time month . If doctor think necessary , bone marrow aspirate every 1-3 month check status disease . You tell study doctor drug supplement take study . Length Study : You may receive combination decitabine gemtuzumab ozogamicin 6 cycle . After , doctor think best interest , may continue receive decitabine alone 24 cycle . During part study , performance status record , physical exam , vital sign measure Day 1 cycle . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) drawn test month . You take study early disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , doctor think longer best interest receive study drug ( ) . Long-Term Follow-up : Once study , follow-up visit every month 2 year . At visit , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Gemtuzumab ozogamicin FDA approve commercially available treatment AML come back treatment patient age 65 year . Decitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment MDS . The use gemtuzumab ozogamicin decitabine combination investigational . Up 100 participant take part study . All enrol The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
