	<detailed_description>Antioxidant enzymes protein produce body protect cell harmful effect chemical , find air pollution . Particulate air pollution diesel exhaust particular show cause also exacerbate allergic airway disease . While ongoing effort improve air quality , remain need alternative method address prevent adverse health effect ambient air pollution , allergic rhinitis , , asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , lung cancer . Currently , therapeutic option , directly target address effect air pollutant susceptible population . The purpose study examine effect broccoli sprout extract airway inflammation cause diesel exhaust particle . This study analyze whether broccoli sprout extract increase level natural , helpful , antioxidant enzyme nose result decrease inflammation cause nasal exposure diesel exhaust particle . Participants attend ten clinical visit , include three screen visit . Some visit ( 2 , 4 , 9 ) last approximately 1 hour require participant return clinic 6 hour . The remain visit ( exclude Visit 1 , also last 1 hour ) take less 30 minute . Participants restrict consume certain vegetable three day prior , course study . During screen phase , last 4-5 day , give inform consent participant undergo baseline evaluation include medical history , physical exam , blood drawing , allergy skin testing , nose washing , diesel exhaust particle ( DEP ) challenge test . For DEP test , small amount fluid contain DEP particle spray nose ( amount equivalent DEP one breathe 2 day Los Angeles ) . Investigators also screen natural antioxidant-related gene antioxidant enzyme indicator DEP sensitivity . Female participant child bear potential urine pregnancy test . Participants ask drink broccoli sprout extract four day row ( visit 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ) . The dosage le 1 cup require participant fast 2 hour study visit broccoli sprout extract ingest . This study require participant allergic cat . An allergy skin test perform determine whether kind allergy .</detailed_description>
