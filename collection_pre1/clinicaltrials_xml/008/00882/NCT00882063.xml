	<brief_title>Study To Evaluate Safety Efficacy P276-00 Subjects With Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label multicenter study P276-00 subject Relapsed and/or Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma . Cohort 3 subject enrol start dose P276-00 50 mg/m2/day give intravenously day 1 day 5 every 21 day . This 21 day administration constitute one cycle P276-00 . Six cycle administer subject . If dose well tolerated next cohort enrol high dose level P276-00 till maximum tolerate dose determine . Safety assessment repeat regular interval efficacy assessment repeat every cycles.After subject complete 6 cycle , follow-up visit 4 week ( +1 week ) study completion.Subjects stable disease respond ( MR , PR CR ) completion 6 cycle give option continue treatment maximum 12 cycle deem progressive disease .</detailed_description>
