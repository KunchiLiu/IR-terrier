	<brief_summary>The main purpose study evaluate toxicity well efficacy chemotherapy regimen involve combination Gemzar , Taxotere , Xeloda ( GTX ) patient pancreatic cancer , undergone complete surgical resection tumor . During screen evaluation , subject physical exam medical history take either PI Co investigator . In addition , routine blood test radiological exam perform , determine eligibility . Following enrollment , patient receive 8 cycle ( 1 cycle = 21 day ) GTX treatment 6 month . During cycle patient receive Gemzar Taxotere day 4 11 , IV , course approximately 2 hour , Xeloda take orally first 14 day every cycle . Patients receive treatment day 15 thru 21 cycle . During cycle treatment patient physical examination , well routine blood work . The first scan do prior initiation treatment , next do completion chemotherapy . A short quality life questionnaire also administer prior cycle 1 treatment , 3-month point , completion chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Gemzar , Taxotere , Xeloda Adjuvant Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The adjuvant treatment resect pancreatic cancer currently flux . Many United States continue use 5FU-based chemotherapy radiation pancreatic bed . Some States , investigator Europe , use 5FU base chemotherapy-alone approach , base ESPAC-1 data . Many investigator believe since gemcitabine active drug metastatic setting , move `` front '' adjuvant treatment pancreatic cancer patient . At Columbia , offer gemcitabine-based treatment discussion patient regard risk , benefit , limitation current knowledge . We usually offer radiation positive margin , chemotherapy alone without . Based early study use gemcitabine , believe ultimately prove effective adjuvant drug 5FU . Some patient ask GTX adjuvant setting well , prompt creation trial . Because concern increase toxicity regimen , determination patient safety primary objective study , careful monitoring adverse event . This trial chemotherapy-only study , offer clean margin resection . Taxotere administer `` weekly '' activity variety tumor type include breast , lung , ovarian prostate cancer . Patients advance breast cancer , include previously treat paclitaxel anthracyclines , respond weekly administration Taxotere . The recommend dose weekly Taxotere 30-40 mg/m2/week 6 8 week . The dose intensity achieve 3 4 week basis . However , protocol give drug 2 every 3 week , thus dose intensity less . Weekly administration Taxotere well tolerate produce substantially less myelosuppression observe standard Taxotere administration every 3 week . Acute toxicity uncommon , peripheral neuropathy . Prolonged treatment weekly Taxotere , may result chronic toxicity ( include , asthenia ( fatigue ) , anemia , edema , excessive lacrimation ( epiphora ) , onycholysis ) . Chronic toxicity prominent Taxotere administer continuous weekly basis , i.e. , without break , delay onset provide break treatment ( example , treat 6 8 week 3 4 week ) ; chronic toxicity occur low cumulative dose continuous weekly schedule Taxotere utilized . Premedication dexamethasone recommend patient receive weekly Taxotere therapy reduce incidence severity fluid retention well severity hypersensitivity reaction . A variety dexamethasone schedule use study weekly Taxotere . Dexamethasone 4 8 mg x 3 dos take orally night , morning , even Taxotere administration appear effective schedule . We find single low dose 10 mg IV Taxotere usually prevent anaphylaxis pedal edema associate drug .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma pancreas completely resect . Patients may node negative nodepositive , must clean margin resection . Ineligible high priority national institutional study . Time surgical recovery great three week , less six week . All radiological evaluation ( must include either CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis CT chest MRI abdomen/pelvis ) must perform within 4 week prior start study therapy . Informed Consent : Each patient must completely aware nature his/her disease process must willingly give consent inform experimental nature therapy , alternative , potential benefit , sideeffects , risk , discomfort . Non pregnant female breast feed negative serum βHCG test within 1 week start study . Men woman childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception treatment 6 month completion treatment . They must understand risk infertility possibly associate adjuvant treatment .
