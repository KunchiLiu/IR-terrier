	<brief_summary>Overall research aim : This study examine effect vitamin D supplementation function endothelium microcirculation patient chronic kidney disease vitamin D deficiency . Hypothesis : Vitamin D therapy patient CKD concomitant vitamin D deficiency improve endothelial , therefore microcirculatory function , reduce level oxidative stress thus reduce risk future CVS event population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research rationale : Cardiovascular ( CVS ) diseases major cause death patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , account approximately half death . Patients CKD far likely die CVS disease progress end stage renal disease . Recently , vitamin D deficiency identify non-traditional CVS risk factor . However , vitamin D routinely prescribe early stage CKD . Previous publication establish endothelial , therefore , microcirculatory dysfunction marker CVS health predictor future CVS event . Studies also show clinical assessment microcirculation reflect overall health function endothelium . Vitamin D show improve endothelial function diabetic patient vitamin D deficiency normal kidney function . However , study examine endothelial dysfunction patient CKD vitamin D deficiency . With prevalence CKD concomitant vitamin D deficiency increase worldwide , press need examine effect vitamin D therapy early stage CKD . This study involve use four , non-invasive , detailed assessment microcirculation could use clinical set enhance CVS risk profiling . The current study design include novel clinical vitro work examine endothelial function , oxidative stress level potential cellular mechanism vitamin D improve endothelial function . Early detection endothelial dysfunction , end stage renal disease reach , provide powerful tool predict future CVS event thus provide opportunity intervene therapy , include vitamin D , early stage renal dysfunction . Study objectives : Primary study objective - evaluate effect vitamin D therapy endothelial function patient CKD vitamin D deficiency . Secondary study objective : evaluate effect vitamin D therapy key clinical parameter patient CKD vitamin D deficiency . Research plan : We conduct double blind , randomise control trial compare oral ergocalciferol placebo adult , non-diabetic patient CKD stage 3-4 vitamin D deficiency ( define &lt; 10ng/ml ( &lt; 30nmol/L ) ) . Based power calculation , 40 subject recruit arm well 15 healthy control subject . Subjects follow 7 month total .</detailed_description>
