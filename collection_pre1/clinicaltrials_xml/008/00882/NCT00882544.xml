	<detailed_description>Minimally invasive surgery become widely accept method surgery many urological condition . This include laparoscopy robotic assist laparoscopic surgery . In adult urology , discussion laparoscopic pyeloplasty replace open surgery gold standard treatment ureteropelvic junction obstruction . Although slow rate , minimally invasive surgery also become standard method treatment pediatric setting . Some urological surgeon predict laparoscopy become standard treatment straightforward pediatric nephrectomy . Benefits laparoscopic surgery include improve cosmesis , reduce postoperative pain issue , reduce length stay . However , laparoscopic use delicate complicate procedure limited due 2-dimensional imaging , rigid non-articulating instrument , time expense require surgeon master technique . The advent robotic surgery minimizes eliminate many issue . Hand wrist movement robot closely mimic actual hand wrist movement open surgery . Three-dimensional image provide surgeon necessary depth perception , articulate instrument six degree freedom allow surgeon tie knot suture easily , learn curve reduce . Robotic surgery add benefit laparoscopy introduction tremor-filtering instrument movement scale . As 2006 , 400 robot worldwide , use primarily urological surgery . Currently , common procedure pediatric robotic surgery pyeloplasty , follow fundoplication , patent ductus arteriosus ligation . However , robotic surgery use difficult reconstructive surgery , appendicovesicostomy bladder augmentation pediatric population . The major impediment widespread application minimally invasive surgery pediatric procedure laparoscopic suture . With increased accuracy , advent small instrument , three-dimensional imaging , robotics premier surgical advancement , allow minimally invasive surgery become viable treatment method wider range procedure surgeon . The first report pediatric robotic surgery publish 2002 described successful surgery fundoplication , cholecystectomy , salpingoophorectomy use da Vinci robotic system . Two recent literature review pediatric robotic surgery report majority study publish area either case report case series.6 , One systematic report publish Spanish , translate abstract available department . The second systematic review report October 2007 , 31 study publish describe 566 patient . Only four study case control , compare robotic surgery either laparoscopic open procedure . Two case control report describe robotic assist pyeloplasty child compare open surgery . As see meta-analysis , publish study robotic surgery infancy additional study necessary . The purpose research provide clear understanding urology department 's robotic pyeloplasty quality outcomes measure . This accomplished develop database research . Specific Aim 1 : To consistently collect performance outcome data robotic pyeloplasty procedure order increase internal understanding procedure . Specific Aim2 : To consistently collect performance outcome data robotic pyeloplasty procedure order perform valuable clinical analysis publication . Hypothesis define data analysis perform . Amendments specify future hypothesis submit IRB appropriate time .</detailed_description>
