	<brief_summary>This non-randomized , open-label study examine safety efficacy betaine addition standard anti-viral therapy genotype 1 hepatitis C non-responders relapsers previous pegylated interferon plus ribavirin . Betaine ( 20 gm/day ) 2 divide dos add Peginterferon alpha 2a ( 180 mcg ) plus weight-based Ribavirin ( 1000 1200 mg/day , body weight &lt; &gt; 75 kg , respectively , 48 week . Patients must diagnose chronic hepatitis C , genotype I , undergone therapy hepatitis C pegylated interferon plus ribavirin . Subjects follow safety , tolerability , hepatitis C viral response effect interferon gene signal peripheral blood mononuclear cell therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Betaine + Combination Antiviral Therapy Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1 Non-responder/Relapsers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective examine safety efficacy betaine combine standard anti-viral therapy previously treat adult subject chronic hepatitis C infect genotype 1 . The efficacy determine comparison sustain viral response ( SVR ) protocol three-drug regimen ( Betaine , Peginterferon plus Ribavirin ) historically see relapsers non-responders retreat standard therapy ( Peginterferon Ribavirin alone ) . Secondary objective include : ( 1 ) comparison occurrence rapid early virologic response first 4 ( Rapid Virologic Response , RVR ) 12 ( Early Virologic Response , EVR ) week therapy , respectively , study regimen historically treat patient . ( 2 ) comparison ALT normalization two group . ( 3 ) effect interferon gene signal peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) two group first 12 week therapy 6 month follow end therapy..</detailed_description>
