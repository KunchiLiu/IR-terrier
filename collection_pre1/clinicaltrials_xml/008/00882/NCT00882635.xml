	<brief_title>The STREAM Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Anticoagulant Sub-study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Past research stable patient coronary artery disease non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTEMI ) demonstrate safety efficacy enoxaparin anticoagulant strategy patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention 1-3 . In patient ST-elevations myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) receive pharmacological reperfusion ( fibrinolysis ) , enoxaparin show attractive alternative unfractionated heparin base upon past modest scale trial ( HART-2 , ENTIRE TIMI 23 , ASSENT-3 , ASSENT-3+ ) 4-6 . These result definitively extend ExTRACT-TIMI 25 trial compare fibrinolysis unfractionated heparin versus enoxaparin 20,506 patient STEMI 7 . The primary endpoint death re-MI occur 9.9 % patient enoxaparin 12.0 % patient unfractionated heparin group ( 17 % RR , p &lt; 0.001 ) ; major bleeding occur 2.1 % 1.4 % respectively ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . This achieve use dose reduction strategy elderly ( &gt; 75yrs ) omit intravenous enoxaparin bolus decrease subcutaneous injection 0.75 mg/kg . After initial fibrinolysis , few patient underwent PCI 30 day enoxaparin group versus unfractionated heparin group ( 22.8 % vs 24.2 % , p=0.027 ) . Among underwent PCI ( n=4674 ) 30 day primary endpoint occur 10.7 % enoxaparin versus 13.8 % unfractionated heparin randomization ( 0.77 RR , p &lt; 0.001 ) ; major bleed different ( 1.4 % vs. 1.6 % , p=NS ) 8 . Despite exist data stable coronary artery disease , NSTEMI , STEMI patient treat fibrinolysis limit data regard approach anticoagulation therapy enoxaparin STEMI patient undergo primary PCI . Within sub-study Which Early ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Therapy study ( WEST ) undertake systematic anti-Xa sampling address adequacy anticoagulation enoxaparin base regime9 , 10 . WEST patient undergo primary PCI receive aspirin , clopidogrel , subcutaneous enoxaparin ( 1mg/kg ) time randomization . Subsequent administration intravenous enoxaparin abciximab time PCI encourage . Those receive supplemental intravenous enoxaparin ( 0.3 - 0.5 mg/kg ) addition subcutaneous enoxaparin achieve anti-Xa level &gt; 0.5 units/ml ( propose therapeutic concentration ) . Amongst receive 1 mg/kg enoxaparin subcutaneous randomization 0.3 mg/kg intravenous enoxaparin time PCI , none excessive anticoagulation ( anti-Xa &gt; 1.5 units/ml ) suggesting may attractive dose strategy . Recently non-randomized comparison unfractionated heparin enoxaparin within FINNESSE study present STEMI patient undergo primary PCI . Preliminary report indicate superior outcome amongst receive enoxaparin 0.5mg/kg intravenous compare unfractionated heparin intravenously . The STREAM study provide unique important opportunity acquire randomize safety efficacy data anticoagulation enoxaparin vs. unfractionated heparin STEMI patient undergo primary PCI .</detailed_description>
