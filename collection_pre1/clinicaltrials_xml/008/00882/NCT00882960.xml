	<brief_summary>Goal research demonstrate reduction report pain follow atomization intra-nasal administration Fentanyl versus reduction pain achieve intravenous Fentanyl . It hypothesize pain reduce follow fentanyl administration use intra-nasal atomization equal intravenous delivery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intranasal Fentanyl Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , pre-hospital provider ability administer analgesia patient intravenous route . Often time patient exposed element , present poor anatomy , position make establish intravenous impractical impossible . The lack delivery method prevent patient receive humane indicate pain medication . In patient access achieve , first subject painful procedure often repeat within twenty-four hour hospital policy subject potential infection risk , often time less aseptic condition . The goal study test method administration pain medication use atomization intra-nasal route compare current standard drug administration intravenous . The medication administer Fentanyl , previously establish approve pre-hospital analgesic medication . As drug potential risk associate unknown side effect allergy , risk would enhance give use different delivery device . Specific risk associate use delivery route would include limited potential soft tissue injury , epistaxis , aspiration The study measure reduction pain follow delivery atomize fentanyl via intra-nasal administration compare intravenous . We ask participant quantify pain use Wong-Baker FACES pain scale ( previously establish valid instrument pain assessment ) assign number pain feeling . The drug administer use atomizer two subsequent report pain use scale take along vital sign .</detailed_description>
