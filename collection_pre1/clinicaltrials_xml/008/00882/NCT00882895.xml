	<brief_summary>This research study test new approach treat high-risk non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma consist autologous hematopoietic ( blood ) stem cell transplant ( use patient 's hematopoietic cell ) follow non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation ( transplant another individual ) . The investigator hypothesize addition second non-myeloablative transplant improve chance long-term control lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The approach recurrent primary refractory non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat patient second-line chemotherapy ( usually 2-3 course ) purpose cytoreduction establish sensitivity chemotherapy . Thereafter , peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilize cyclophosphamide granulocyte colony stimulate factor , apheresed cryopreserved . Unfortunately , subgroup patient poor outcome use autologous transplantation include transform lymphoma well patient attain minimal disease state due chemoresistant disease . In group 17 patient transformed lymphoma receive autologous transplant Stanford University , median EFS OS 1.48 2.7 year respectively 7-year survival 20 % . In comparison , patient chemosensitive follicular lymphoma receive regimen also poor median EFS 1.3 year , median survival 6.7 year . The outcomes patient chemotherapy-resistant relapsed NHL also poor EFS range 20 % many study autologous transplantation . These group patient limited disease control survival standard chemotherapy regimen , although often excellent cytoreduction high-dose chemotherapy regimen , relapse remain primary cause treatment failure . The current trial utilizes similar approach take patient multiple myeloma , appear benefit allogeneic graft-versus-tumor effect , use combine autologous non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant regimen reduce transplant-related complication . In addition , limited report use autologous/allogeneic approach lymphoma patient use non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant . Eligible patient treat high-dose chemotherapy use BCNU , etoposide , cytarabine melphalan autologous hematopoietic cell support method cytoreduction . Approximately 60-120 day autologous transplant , patient receive allogeneic transplant use preparative regimen total lymphoid irradiation anti-thymocyte globulin attempt develop graft-versus-lymphoma effect .</detailed_description>
