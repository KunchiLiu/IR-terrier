	<brief_summary>AEG35156 second generation antisense target XIAP mRNA low XIAP level apoptotic threshold cancer cell , enhance sensitivity intrinsic death chemotherapy . Advanced HCC attractive target AEG35156 since XIAP highly express HCC may prevent cancer cell undergoing apoptosis . Second generation antisense molecule know accumulate liver AEG35156 may regulate XIAP protein expression HCC cell thus promote apoptotic death .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HCC diagnose : Histology , AASLD Criteria diagnosis make clinically patient know hepatitis B cirrhosis etiology liver mass &gt; 2cm typical feature HCC ( i.e. , hypervascular washout portal/venous phase ) dynamic image study ( contrast CT / USG / MRI ) alternatively AFP &gt; 200 ng/ml . The tumor suitable curative treatment ( resection / transplant / local ablative therapy ) patient medically inoperable refuse treatment . At least one measurable lesion accord RECIST criterion . Age &gt; 18 year . Life expectancy great 12 week . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( please refer Appendix 1 ) . ChildPugh score A B ( please refer Appendix 2 ) . Adequate organ function define : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN ALT AST &lt; 2.5 x ULN Total bilirubin &lt; 50 μmol/L INR &lt; 1.7 No encephalopathy clinically Normal ECG For woman childproducing potential , use effective contraceptive method study . Prior local therapy tumor ( e.g . surgery , RFA , PEI , chemoembolization , radiotherapy ) allow provide target lesion subject local therapy and/or disease progression document target lesion subject local therapy . The treatment must complete least 4 week patient recover acute toxicity treatment . For patient hepatitis B , patient must receive antiviral therapy prior registration . ChildPugh score C. Patients prior systemic chemotherapy . Patients cancer relate therapy include radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study . Patients receive investigational agent concurrently . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients peripheral neuropathy . Uncontrolled intercurrent disease , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Known bleeding diathesis . Pregnant nursing woman . NOTE : Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( sterile surgically sterile ; hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Men unwilling use acceptable form birth control engage sexual contact woman child bear potential . Active , uncontrolled bacterial , viral , fungal infection , require systemic therapy . Serious nonmalignant disease could compromise protocol objective opinion investigator and/or sponsor . Patients currently receive investigational agent . Subjects use previous antisense oligonucleotide last 90 day exclude . Unwillingness inability comply procedure require protocol .</criteria>
