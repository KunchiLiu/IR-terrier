	<brief_summary>In person SCI , inherent consideration , use mechanical stimulation study determine improvement bone mass . To achieve maximum transmission vibration vibrate plate lower body , legs must extend foot firmly place surface plate device . Thus , logistical consideration must address perform mechanical intervention person SCI . In complete almost complete motor injury , lack musculoskeletal function level lesion , would prevent rigid straight leg extension press one 's foot surface , regardless angle tilt would permit adequate transmission impulse able-bodied individual ( preliminary data ) . However , one subject SCI , measurable , albeit low level , transmission vibration increase angle tilt ( preliminary data ) . Because ability transmit signal individual complete SCI , possibility exists form mechanical support/manipulation , great signal transmission may possible . The study able determine best angle transmit mechanical vibration lower body SCI patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Use Low-magnitude , High Frequency Mechanical Stimulation Bone Persons With Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experiments perform 12 person SCI 10 healthy able-bodied optimize methodology transmission mechanical impulse low extremity person SCI . This entail follow combination : 1. positional modification ( sit , lie stand tolerable ) ; 2. bracing knee prevent flexion/extension ; 3. bracing leg and/or knee ; 4. support ankle ; 5. tilt surface ( tilt table ) maximum angle 45 degree ; 6 . Standing assistance stand frame subject tolerate stand 5 minute time period . 7. increase magnitude plate acceleration ( 0.2-0.6g ) ; 8. mechanically press leg ( ankle knee joint relatively fixed position orthotic device ) plate spring-loaded method ( envision pad belt-like article wear around waist would attach bungee cord ( spring ) side vibrate plate ; maximum force deliver would equal 50 lbs one-third total body weight , whichever less ) . An accelerometer measurement impulse generation place surface vibrate plate foot ; second place shin 4 inch knee ( attach double sided tape athletic bandage wrap ) ; third accelerometer place mouth bite-bar . Measurements would acquire combination body position , joint/leg fixation , magnitude plate acceleration ( `` g '' force ) , mechanical force press foot plate determine optimal transmission impulse . This study determine optimal methodology use vibrate plate transmit impulse person chronic SCI , anticipation application increase bone mass individual acute chronic SCI . It anticipate session 30 120 minute . An individual may voluntarily participate many 5 session . The knowledge gain first set study obviate need perform less effective method mechanical signal transmission subsequent study . It anticipate effective , well clinically applicable , form mechanical stimulation identify , performed subject . This preliminary study also provide information require determine practical aspect length session number session per week future intervention trial . Since research may adverse effect unborn child do pregnancy , administer pregnancy test appropriate . Subjects ask avoid become pregnant use contraceptive , take precaution become pregnant .</detailed_description>
