	<brief_title>Ferinject® Patient With Thrombocytosis Secondary Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For first time platelet abnormality IBD report 1968 , description increase platelet count patient exacerbation clinical activity 1 . Since establish thrombocytosis platelet activation common feature IBD2 . Both feature strongly connect thromboembolic event , major cause patient morbidity mortality 3 . In vitro study far show spontaneous platelet aggregation present 30 % IBD patient compare none control besides independent disease severity 4 . Unfortunately mechanisms behind abnormal megakaryopoiesis completely understood . Nevertheless platelet store produce large amount inflammatory mediator activate multiple proinflammatory substance . Therefore , platelet regard major target therapy inflammatory bowel diseases 5 . An increase systemic cytokine level IL-6 IL-11 may contribute enhanced platelet production . Also intestinal bleeding iron deficiency , major symptom IBD , may stimulatory effect megakaryopoiesis 6 . Previously , observed normalization elevate platelet count IBD patient iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) upon treatment intravenous iron sucrose 7 . We therefore believe iron deficiency causatively involved pathogenesis thrombocytosis IBD intend investigate effect intravenous iron therapy platelet level platelet activation marker patient IBD iron deficiency . Vifor ( International ) Inc. develop new formulation parenteral iron , FERINJECT® ( 5 % w/v iron carboxymaltose solution water injection ) . Based preclinical toxicity data clinical experience , FERINJECT® cause anaphylactic reaction liver toxicity . Based human pharmacokinetic data , estimate terminal half-life FERINJECT® 16 hour . The analysis FERINJECT® positron emission tomography ( PET ) study six patient receive single dose 100mg iron FERINJECT® demonstrate , initial distribution phase , major proportion dose distribute bone marrow . Red cell utilization iron find high . After 24 day , patient IDA show red cell utilization 91 % 99 % . Various study demonstrate FERINJECT® could safely administer dose 1000mg , significant advantage FERINJECT® iron sucrose . A multiple-dose phase I/II study patient IBD investigate safety , efficacy , kinetics repeat dos FERINJECT® complete . Patients treat unit ( Medical University Vienna ) also analyze regard effect VIT45 platelet count . Similar experience iron sucrose , observe significant drop thrombocytosis within 8 week point direct effect iron regulate megakaryopoiesis vivo8 . This study try show benefit patient , high platelet count , iron deficiency IBD , receive intravenous iron therapy . As iron preparation , overdose respect total amount avoid . The maximum infused weekly dose FERINJECT® 500 mg. Based animal toxicity data patient experience , FERINJECT® cause anaphylactic reaction liver toxicity dos intend use study . However , due relatively large dos iron administer , patient monitor carefully throughout study symptom iron overload . Potential benefit patient include decrease platelet count , besides increase hemoglobin level normalization iron store . Primary Objective : To evaluate efficacy FERINJECT® reduce elevated platelet count Secondary Objectives : To evaluate effect FERINJECT® coagulation platelet activation parameter To evaluate efficacy FERINJECT® normalize iron deficiency To evaluate change quality life disease activity To evaluate safety FERINJECT®</detailed_description>

A highly effective method birth control define result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly implant , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , IUDs , sexual abstinence vasectomise partner . Nonchildbearing potential include surgically sterilize least 6 month prior study postmenopausal , define amenorrhoea least 12 month . Demonstrate ability understand requirement study , provide write informed consent , abide study restriction , agree undergo require assessment . CDAI &gt; 220 , CAI &gt; 6 Significant anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 10.5 g/dl ) , anaemia cause iron deficiency ( e.g . anaemia due cancer infection ) Blood transfusion iron therapy previous 4 week , erythropoietin treatment within 8 week prior enrollment . Concomitant therapy prednisolone 20mg/d , 6mercaptopurine , infliximab azathioprine must initiate least 4 month prior study dose must stable least 8 week . Other drug know effect megakaryopoiesis ( e.g . interferonalpha ) . Severe concomitant disease need surgery within 8 week Hemochromatosis ironstorage disorder ( e.g . thalassemia , siderosis , lead poisoning anaemia , porphyria cutanea tarda ) Treatment investigational drug within 30 day prior enrollment Active severe infection malignancy carcinoma situ cervix nonmelanoma skin cancer .
