	<brief_summary>This observational study collect information current incidence management hypotension baby born term late preterm admit Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICUs ) within Neonatal Research Network ( NRN ) . Participants include newborn infant bear 34 0/7 week gestation great admit NICU Network center intubate mechanically ventilate less 72 hour age . The information gather provide framework design potential randomized control trial treatment hypotension neonate . This observational study time-limited enrollment period 4-6 month ; NRN center continue enroll least 50 patient enrol per center ( approximately 800-1,000 subject total ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An estimate 30-50 percent infant bear near term require ventilation respiratory failure also receive therapy hypotension associate clinical instability , poor urine output , poor circulation tissue , metabolic acidosis ( pH imbalance body accumulate much acid ) . Emerging evidence , although limited , suggest underlie cause hypotension many infant adrenal gland produce adequate amount cortisol . This observational study determine current incidence management hypotension infant bear least 34 0/7 week gestation intubate mechanically ventilate less 72 hour age . The goal define target population potential randomize controlled trial treatment hypotension infant . In study , 16 NICHD Neonatal Research Network center enrol least 50 infant , collect basic demographic baseline data mother baby . In infant treated hypotension , data collect dose , duration , type therapy , age blood pressure time therapy start , indication therapy .</detailed_description>
