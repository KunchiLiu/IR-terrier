	<detailed_description>This phase I study standard 3x3 design . Patients proceed treatment series cohort three drug deliver five day begin dose Etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1-5 , Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 day 1-3 , clofarabine 20 mg/m2 IV day 2-6 . Presuming subsequent cohort tolerable 1 patient per cohort develop DLT , MTD patient treat cohort 3-6 patient final dose level Etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1-5 , Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 day 1-5 , Clofarabine 30 mg/m2 IV day 2-6 . Patients fail enter remission may receive 4 day therapy Etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1-4 , Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 day 1-2 1-4 , Clofarabine 20-30 mg/m2 IV day 1-4 . According establish definition dose limit toxicity recommend phase II dose establish . After establish final cohort expand 15 patient .</detailed_description>
