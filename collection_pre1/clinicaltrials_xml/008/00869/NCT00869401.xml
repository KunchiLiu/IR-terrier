	<brief_summary>Dasatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . This randomized phase I/II trial study best dose dasatinib see well work compare placebo give together radiation therapy temozolomide treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib Placebo , Radiation Therapy , Temozolomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial include phase I dose-escalation study double-blind randomize phase II trial patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Phase I cohort 3 dose-escalation trial dasatinib combination radiation concomitant temozolomide . Patients receive concomitant chemotherapy radiation therapy cycle one . Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy 28-42 day post cycle one treatment . Patients receive dasatinib post cycle 8 treatment progressive disease , unacceptable adverse event refusal . Phase II randomize trial two treatment arm . Patients randomized time registration ratio 1:2 respectively either standard therapy arm ( continuous daily placebo prior , standard radiotherapy/temozolomide follow temozolomide . For information please see Arms section . The primary objective list . Primary Objectives : 1 . To establish maximum tolerate dose dasatinib combine radiation temozolomide patient population ( Phase I ) 2 . To determine efficacy dasatinib combination radiotherapy concomitant adjuvant temozolomide patient newly diagnose glioblastoma , compare standard care approach treatment patient consist radiotherapy temozolomide , follow adjuvant temozolomide ( Phase II ) Patients follow 5 year post treatment . The study permanently close accrual January 31 , 2014 .</detailed_description>
