	<brief_summary>- To determine depth coagulation possible human liver tissue use saline link RF Surface ablation Tissue Link float ball . - To determine efficacy technique surface liver tumor use saline link RF surface ablati - To determine safe ( non-popping upper limit ) power per area permit 1 cm depth tissue destruction without inflow occlusion da 2 cm depth inflow occlusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment Plan : Patients resectable hepatic metastasis confine liver refer Study Chairs undergo routine work-up hepatic resection . Operative Procedure : Stage I complete data analyze Stage II commences . Stage I data use define safe level use Stage II . Stage I—Depth coagulation without inflow occlusion fix time - power pop threshold . At surgery , absence extrahepatic disease , liver dissect usual fashion bi-segmentectomy , hemihepatectomy large liver resection . Prior transection liver , saline link RF ablation perform normal liver tissue within area resection away tumor propose line transection . 1 cm 2 cm diameter study together 8 patient . They treat total 18 minute ( 9 min 1 cm 9 min 2 cm 9 minute inflow occlusion . The 4 cm lesion study 8 patient , 4 receive 9 minute inflow occlusion . After resection liver establishment resection margin tumor , ablate area normal liver tissue excise frozen study depth lesion examine H &amp; E histological technique use vital stain allow definition tissue depth . Stage II—An ablate resect Study Once parameter define normal liver , effect surface RF ablation resectable hepatic tumor come surface liver examine . In portion study , tumor treat saline link RF ablation power duration application find produce maximum safe depth coagulation . The surface area coagulation dependent upon size tumor . The area treatment encompass tumor well zone least 0.5cm outside edge tumor . Inflow occlusion use one half patient . After resection liver establishment resection margin tumor , ablate area excise frozen study depth lesion examine H &amp; E histological technique use vital stain allow definition tissue depth . Twelve tumor treat 12 patient . Pathology Evaluation First Group Patients The normal tissue expose RF resect , prepare histo-pathological study examine determine extent tissue necrosis popping , . Second Group Patients Tumors expose RF ablation resect extent tissue necrosis popping determine . Also , damage normal tissue examine .</detailed_description>
