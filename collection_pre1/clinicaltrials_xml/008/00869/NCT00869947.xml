	<brief_summary>Amputees wear conventional prosthesis require 20-30 % metabolic energy walk speed non-amputees discrepancy apparent faster walk speed . Amputees choose walk speed 30-40 % slow non-amputees . Preferred walk speed likely influence elevate metabolic energy , underlie reason slow preferred walking speed fully understood . Unilateral amputee exhibit highly asymmetrical gait pattern likely require metabolic energy impair functional mobility , increase risk degenerative joint disease , osteo-arthritis lower back pain . Improvements prosthetic device could enhance mobility amputee , thus positively effect rehabilitation ambulation veteran . A prosthesis allow amputee reduce metabolic energy would especially useful rehabilitation older , ill individual reduce exercise capacity could literally restore walk ability people currently non-ambulatory . Hypotheses . Amputees wear Massachusetts Institute Technology ( MIT ) Powered Ankle-Foot ( PAF ) prosthesis lower metabolic cost , faster prefer walk speed , improve gait symmetry walk amputee wear conventional prosthesis nearly metabolic cost , prefer walk speed , gait symmetry walking age , gender , height , weight match non-amputees .</brief_summary>
