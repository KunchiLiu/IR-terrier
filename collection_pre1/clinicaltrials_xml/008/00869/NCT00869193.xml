	<brief_title>Effect Grape Seed Extract Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : High blood pressure major risk factor morbidity mortality stroke , heart disease , end-stage renal disease . Several study show dietary polyphenols derive fruit vegetable ( include grape product ) low blood pressure normotensive hypertensive subject . Study objectives : Primary objective : To study , subject elevate blood pressure level , effect grape seed extract high polyphenols , daytime ambulatory systolic diastolic blood pressure ( SBP DBP , respectively ) . Secondary objective : To explore mechanistic pathway responsible blood pressure lower efficacy case blood pressure lower effect show . Study population : Each treatment group consist 35 men postmenopausal woman ( 35-75 year age ) daytime SBP 120 159 mmHg . The total number subject 70 . Study design : This study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel design 2 treatment , 1-week run-in period , 8-week intervention period . The 2 treatment consist placebo capsule capsule grape seed extract . Study outcomes : Daytime ambulatory blood pressure ( ABP ) measure every 20 minute 2 x 12 hour baseline 2 x 12 hour end intervention . Furthermore , intervention period , 24-hour urine collect 2 blood sample take order investigate mechanistic pathway platelet function .</detailed_description>
