	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow cancer . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer cell growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving bortezomib together rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together rituximab work treat patient post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Rituximab Treating Patients With Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate overall ( complete partial ) response rate patient CD20+ post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder treat bortezomib rituximab . Secondary - To evaluate duration remission , time treatment failure , relapse-free survival , overall survival patient . - To characterize quantitative qualitative toxicity regimen . OUTLINE : - Induction therapy : Patients receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) completion induction therapy proceed maintenance therapy 6 month rest . Patients achieve partial remission ( PR ) stable disease completion induction therapy receive additional bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve CR/PR completion bortezomib therapy proceed maintenance therapy 3 month rest . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive bortezomib IV rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 6 month 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
