	<brief_title>Study Inoperable Non-Metastatic Pancreatic CA ( Stage IVA ) With Neoadjuvant GTX , Radiation With Gemzar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The evolution regimen , consist Gemzar , Taxotere Xeloda ( oral 5FU ) ( GTX ) , carefully develop past three year laboratory clinical work . Initially , collaboration Dr. William Sherman Division Medical Oncology assess clinical effect two agent , Gemzar Taxotere pancreatic cancer patient . In vitro study find single agent drug ( Gemzar Taxotere ) minimally effective pancreatic carcinoma line , express mutant p53 activate mutated ra . Activated mutant ra find approximately 95 % pancreatic carcinoma . However , agent add together tissue culture experiment find activity additive . The clinical study perform Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center demonstrate 27 % objective response rate CT scan include one complete response intent treat analysis 15 patient within study . The majority patient metastatic liver disease minority inoperable pancreatic carcinoma without liver metastasis . Though small single arm , single institution study suggest trend towards improve response patient disease two agent combine . In addition , valuable lesson learn vitro work Gemzar Taxotere . Importantly , find combination equally toxic mutant wild type p53 pancreatic cancer cell , well cell mutant ra . Also , docetaxel pharmacokinetics favorable distinct advantage use taxane know paclitaxel . They follow : 1 ) Taxotere enters tumor cell efficiently paclitaxel lipophilic ; 2 ) Taxotere pump cell P-glycoprotein efficiently paclitaxel ; 3 ) Taxotere ' half life significantly longer paclitaxel 60 minute infusion Taxotere give approximate pharmacokinetics paclitaxel administer 24 hour continuous infusion . These laboratory study literature form rationale use Taxotere ( docetaxel ) instead paclitaxel . After initial clinical laboratory study go back laboratory investigate property Gemcitabine , Taxotere add Xeloda ( 5-DFUR ) vitro maximize biochemical synergy minimize toxicity . We find important characteristic drug combination pancreatic cancer cell synthesize current protocol . We find sequence specificity drug 5-DFUR precede Gemzar 72 96 hour Gemzar add Taxotere achieve maximum synergy . Taxotere cytotoxicity dose dependent 20 nM cell kill obtain past point . This would mean one would need use high dose Taxotere regimen would doubtful whether increased dos would obtain cell kill linear scale . We investigate many different combination 3 agent laboratory determine best combination achieve biochemical synergy decrease concentration drug lose anti-tumor effect decrease toxicity patient .</detailed_description>
