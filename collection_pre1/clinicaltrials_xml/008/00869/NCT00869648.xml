	<brief_summary>Ventilation basic life support improve survival cardiac arrest patient significantly . Unfortunately , contrast willingness potential rescuer perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation . For example , although healthcare professional would perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation 4-year old drown child &gt; 90 % case , likelihood would decrease ~10 % case young male unconscious patient San Francisco public bus . Possibly , lay rescuer would perform assisted ventilation often simple ventilation device available . However , willingness perform assist ventilation plus ability open maintain airway patent necessary ensure efficient ventilation unconscious patient unprotected upper airway . Since retention skill basic life support class notoriously low , resuscitation tool incorporate self-explanatory feature improve applicability , provide built-in safety . Thus , option could ensure open airway use built-in indicator within ventilate device confirm correct head extension . One possible approach may determine head position angle make open airway likely , integrate angle scale ventilate device ; however , safe head extension need determine first prevent harm . The purpose study determine head position angle ventilation parameter reflect neutral position , maximal extension position deem optimal anaesthesiologist patient undergoing anaesthesia induction elective surgery first step design ventilate device optimise ventilation unprotected upper airway . The investigator ventilate 30 patient pillow head simulate ventilation operate theater , 30 patient without pillow head simulate ventilation cardiopulmonary resuscitation . Dentures removed assessment . After anaesthesia induction head consecutively flexed three position measurement perform . Afterwards , general anaesthesia surgery ensue . The health risk extra minute mask ventilation minimal . The null hypothesis difference head position angle ventilation parameter .</brief_summary>
