	<detailed_description>Neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) classification evolve time include group related tumor originate neuroendocrine cell . This group include carcinoid tumor , pancreatic endocrine tumor ( PETs ) , catecholamine-secreting tumor ( e.g . pheochromocytoma ) , medullary carcinoma thyroid small cell lung cancer . Carcinoid tumor mostly derive serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cell , occur frequently gastrointestinal tract ( 67.5 % ) bronchopulmonary system ( 25.3 % ) . Pancreatic endocrine tumor ( PETs ) arise several type pancreatic islet cell , manifest insulinomas , somatostatinomas glucagonomas . NETs broadly classify functional nonfunctional , determine whether plasma hormone elevation endocrine symptom occur . NETs classify two group : 1 ) rapidly grow anaplastic small cell cancer small cell lung cancer small cell carcinoma GI tract 2 ) slow grow , differentiate NETs carcinoid PET . In total , estimate 12,000 - 15,000 case NETs ( count small cell carcinoma ) diagnose United States annually . The incidence carcinoid tumor alone estimate 2 per 100,000 United States ( 5,400 cases/yr/U.S. ) . PETs less common , 1,000 new case per year United States . Carcinoids PETs potentially curable surgical resection ; 5-year survival rate patient localize carcinoid 78.2 % . However , tumor frequently indolent growth patient often present unresectable metastatic disease ( 80 % case ) . The hormonal symptom may accompany disease , exemplify carcinoid syndrome , complicate management patient . Hormonal therapy , namely octreotide , use relieve symptom report response rate 1-5 % . Metastatic disease associate significantly bad prognosis ; carcinoid patient visceral metastasis 5-year survival rate 38.5 % . Based efficacy combination cisplatin etoposide treat small cell lung cancer , agent explore treatment pancreatic islet cell tumor carcinoid . In general , etoposide-cisplatin regimen poor response rate slow grow , differentiated NET group average response rate 7-10 % . Furthermore , cisplatin-etoposide regimen associate significant toxicity , include frequent severe neutropenia , ototoxicity , neurotoxicity nephrotoxicity . An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) trial patient metastatic unresectable progressive pancreatic islet cell tumor , include poorly well-differentiated PETs , show regimen streptozocin doxorubicin significantly superior objective response rate compare combination streptozocin fluorouracil ( 69 versus 45 % , p=0.05 ) . The study use definition objective response include regression tumor mass , regression malignant tumor cause hepatomegaly reduction excessive hormone production . Streptozocin-doxorubicin also significantly superior streptozocin-fluorouracil term median time tumor progression median overall survival ( 2.2 versus 1.4 year , p=0.004 ) . However , significant toxicity associate either streptozocin-based regimen roughly 80 % either arm experiencing vomiting last throughout 5-day course streptozocin per cycle . Additionally , Grade 3/4 leukopenia occur 25 % patient receive streptozocin-fluorouracil , one treatment-related death secondary leukopenia complicate sepsis . Notably , streptozocin significant renal toxicity cause significant proteinuria . Thus , doubtful efficacy streptozocin-based combination significant associate toxicity limited role cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment differentiate NETs . In lab , investigator find capecitabine ( 5-DFUR ) , oral pro-drug 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , temozolomide synergistic induction apoptosis 2 human NET cell line . The mechanism pathways involve investigation , find important synergism temozolomide exposed NET cell line end capecitabine exposure . The team believe combination temozolomide capecitabine prove effective regimen . Our hypothesis DNA damage induce capecitabine incorporation 5-FdUTP DNA reduce thymidine pool inhibition thymidylate synthase via 5-FdUMP synergistically potentiate effect temozolomide alkylator reduce repair activity O6-alkylguanyl-alkyl-transferase ( O6-AGAT ) . O6-AGAT DNA repair enzyme remove temozolomide-alkylated group guanine . A 5-day regimen temozolomide vital decrease O6-AGAT level direct bind lead suicide inactivation O6-AGAT-mediated DNA repair . This saturate O6-AGAT 23 day temozolomide , thus allow last 23 day dose induce alkylation DNA thereby induce apoptosis . The investigator find cell prior 5-FU exposure sensitive induction apoptosis temozolomide . Another fundamental rationale hypothesis investigator develop synthesis novel regimen NET base upon cytokinetics p53 . NET characteristically slow growing , yet fatal , cancer great majority wild type p53 . Therefore , drug resistance probably base upon mutational p53 cause wild type p53 status rather upon slow cytokinetics . The best way kill slow grow tumor long interval G0 phase lipophilic alkylators ( i.e . Temodar ) utilize continuous exposure antimetabolites Xeloda continuous infusion 5-FU . Xeloda 's half-life 11 hr q 12 hr dose roughly equivalent continuous infusion . The investigator believe hypothesis correct well ground pharmacologic cell cycle principle . The investigator date pilot experience ten patient receive capecitabine , total 1500 mg/m2/day/PO , fourteen day , temozolomide 150-200 mg/m2 give last five day course capecitabine . All initial 10 patient progressive , differentiated NET dramatic symptomatic pain relief least 75 % reduction tumor marker . Five patient metastatic carcinoid 5 metastatic pancreatic NET . All patient progressive liver metastasis , 10 patient fail octreotide therapy long act somatostatin , 7/10 fail prior chemotherapy regimen . One carcinoid patient complete response ( CR ) proven surgery without tumor recurrence 22 month surgery chemotherapy . Three patient partial response ( PR ) one patient minor response ( MR ) liver metastasis . Two patient experience stable disease ( SD ) 6 8 month therapy . The overall response rate prove CT MRI scan ( CR , PR MR ) 50 % date . Overall , clinical benefit lab base regimen occur 7/10 patient ( CR , PR , MR SD ) . Toxicities minor none grade 2 myelosuppression . There hospitalization complication side effect except grade 12 nausea temozolomide therapy . Therefore , study seek evaluate role two drug disease .</detailed_description>

Men woman childbearing potential must consent use effective barrier contraception treatment 2 month thereafter . Prior chemotherapy capecitabine temozolomide . Patients previously treat continuous infusion 5FU schedule DTIC ( dacarbazine ) , similar capecitabine temozolomide , respectively , exclude . Patients prior therapy 3 prior chemotherapy regimens bolus 5FU , streptozocin , anthracyclines , Camptothecin11 ( CPT11 ) , etoposide , platinum agent Hypersensitivity : Patients history severe hypersensitivity reaction capecitabine , 5FU , temozolomide DTIC exclude ( i.e . anaphylaxis anaphylactoid reaction ) Serious medical psychiatric illness prevent informed consent intensive treatment ( e.g , serious infection ) Patients tumor spread central brain ( cerebral/cerebellum ) spinal cord . Patients compromise immune system increase risk toxicity lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , HIVpositive patient exclude study Prior malignancy last 5 year ; curatively treat carcinoma insitu previously treat curative intent ( cancer free past year )</criteria>
