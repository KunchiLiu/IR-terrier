	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare occurrence rate high pressure phase final pressure outcomes patient treated glaucoma medication prior expect onset high pressure phase patient glaucoma medication start onset high pressure phase . The investigator hypothesize glaucoma medication start prior expect onset high pressure phase , high pressure phase occur frequently ultimate pressure level lower glaucoma medication start onset phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tube shunt procedure popular surgery control glaucoma . Tube shunt device design drain eye fluid ( aqueous humor ) tube insert front chamber eye ( anterior chamber ) plate secure mid-posterior section outer eyeball wall . The body lay collagen tissue form capsule around plate . The fluid filter capsule collagen tissue reabsorb ocular systemic circulation . The collagen tissue continue remodel long period time ( year ) . However , well characterize , yet poorly understood , phenomenon occur many patient 4-8 week device 's implantation , call hypertensive phase . The pressure eye increase desirable level 10 immediately tube shunt implantation much high level , range 20 30 's , may gradually return less 20 . Such high pressure phase cause irreversible damage eye glaucoma . The usual management high pressure phase start glaucoma medication soon detect . A previous study conduct show high pressure phase resolve half patient medical therapy , half may continue high expect pressure . The exact cause high pressure phase unknown . However , postulate mechanism may involve compaction collagen tissue layer eye 's fluid pressure collagen tissue laid , turn creates firm , dense capsule make escape fluid difficult . Therefore , argue formation eye fluid reduce medication initial period collagen tissue laid , compaction collagen , subsequently high pressure phase may avoid . The purpose study compare occurrence rate high pressure phase final pressure outcomes patient treated glaucoma medication prior expect onset high pressure phase patient glaucoma medication start onset high pressure phase . We hypothesize glaucoma medication start prior expect onset high pressure phase , high pressure phase occur frequently ultimate pressure level lower glaucoma medication start onset phase . We believe study significant impact management glaucoma tube shut procedure . If true rate pressure level hypertensive phase reduce simply start glaucoma medication reduce formation eye fluid expect high pressure phase begin , generally 4 week implantation tube shunt device , glaucoma patient save exposure high level eye pressure , eventual pressure control may better .</detailed_description>
