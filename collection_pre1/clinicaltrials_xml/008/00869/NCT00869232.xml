	<brief_summary>There four previous Total Therapy ( TT1 IIIB ) study multiple myeloma MIRT 1989 present . Results show participant treat study well outcome ( mean live longer well response treatment ) compare individual treat standard chemotherapy . Past study conduct MIRT institution show participant high-risk feature gene array study tend short remission ( disappearance sign symptom myeloma ) survive long participant low-risk myeloma . Researchers MIRT think one reason myeloma cell re-grow time participant receive treatment recover high-dose chemotherapy . In study , participant receive several chemotherapy drug previously show effective myeloma , low dos short cycle . It hop give drug way , myeloma cell time re-grow cycle , therefore result long remission . This study do attempt improve remission rate survival time participant high-risk myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To find give multi-agent chemotherapy lower frequent dos make timely delivery chemotherapy cycle possible , result good treatment outcomes - To find changing way drug give transplant phase also result few side effect , still effective - To find give treatment transplant ( call `` inter-transplant therapy '' ) prevent myeloma re-growing transplant - To find long-term maintenance therapy result long remission - To find effect ( good bad ) overall treatment - To learn biology genetics multiple myeloma perform image test collect blood , bone marrow aspirate biopsy , biopsy lesion see MRI PET scan research</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must newly diagnose active MM require treatment . Patients previous history smolder myeloma eligible evidence progressive disease require chemotherapy . Patients must either untreated one cycle systemic MM therapy , exclude bisphosphonates localize radiation . Patients must highrisk disease , define one following : GEP risk score &gt; = 0.66 LDH &gt; = 360 U/L Rule hemolysis , infection contact PI clarification Zubrod &lt; = 2 , unless solely due symptom MMrelated bone disease . Patients must platelet count &gt; = 50,000/uL , unless low level explain extensive bone marrow plasmacytosis . Patients must least 18 year age old 75 year age time registration . Participants must preserve renal function define serum creatinine level &lt; 3 mg/dL . Participants must ejection fraction ECHO MUGA scan &gt; = 45 % Patients must adequate pulmonary function study &gt; = 50 % predict mechanical aspect ( FEV square , FVC , etc ) diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) &gt; = 50 % predict . If patient unable complete pulmonary function test due MM relate pain condition , exception may grant principle investigator document patient candidate high dose therapy . Patients must sign IRBapproved informed consent indicate understand propose treatment understand protocol approve IRB . Does highrisk disease Poorly control hypertension , diabetes mellitus , serious medical illness psychiatric illness could potentially interfere completion treatment accord protocol . Patients must prior malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient receive treatment one year prior enrollment . Other cancer acceptable patient 's life expectancy exceed five year . Pregnant nursing woman may participate . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy document within one week registration . Subjects reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method .</criteria>
