	<brief_summary>Everolimus oral mTOR inhibitor demonstrate preliminary efficacy safety diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) preclinical clinical study . The purpose research study determine whether Everolimus plus rituximab safe effective participant relapse refractory DLBCL . Everolimus investigational drug work block special protein help cancer cell grow . The safety effectiveness Everolimus treatment DLBCL yet fully determine still investigational . The drug study , rituximab , approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma certain type non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Rituximab drug destroy normal cancerous B-cells .</brief_summary>
