	<brief_summary>A . Statement Hypotheses : HIV-infected patient increase incidence emphysema compare non-HIV-infected smoker , hypothesize accelerated disease progression result one latent infection amplifies pulmonary inflammatory response cigarette smoke . Pneumocystis one infectious agent likely play key role development HIV-associated emphysema . Colonization Pneumocystis demonstrate HIV-infected subject , HIV-infected smoker particularly susceptible Pc colonization regardless CD4 cell count use prophylaxis . Pneumocystis colonization also increase non-HIV-infected patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) directly relate severity disease . The presence Pneumocystis lung , even low level see colonization , produce inflammatory change similar see COPD , increase number neutrophil cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocyte . We propose Pneumocystis accelerate emphysema HIV-infected smoker stimulate inflammation tissue destruction . We examine role co-infection Pneumocystis pathogenesis HIV-associated emphysema mechanism cause emphysema progression .

	<detailed_description>We propose Pneumocystis accelerate emphysema HIV-infected smoker stimulate inflammation tissue destruction . This grant examine role co-infection Pneumocystis pathogenesis HIV-associated emphysema mechanism cause emphysema progression . These study lead information provide rational basis prevention therapy HIV-associated emphysema provide model emphysema general population antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , impressive decline morbidity mortality HIV see [ 18 ] . These improvement constitute cure , however ; 400,000 people currently live HIV United States 40 million people infected worldwide . With improved treatment increase life expectancy , incidence type lung diseases HIV-associated emphysema pulmonary hypertension may become common . Respiratory symptom extremely common HIV-infected population , even among without history pulmonary infection . HIV-infected subject note accelerated form chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) /emphysema [ 4 , 5 ] . This disease see untreated HIV disease may become common treated HIV population frequently report without history AIDS-related pulmonary complication . Smoking-related disease emphysema particular concern HIV+ population . Smoking rate high population long term exposure cigarette smoke set HIV infection may increase number complication see . Smoking HIV+ population associate bad general health , physical functioning , quality life , cognitive functioning Before HAART era , HIV+ subject note accelerated form emphysema . Unlike many AIDS-defining opportunistic infection , HIV-associated emphysema may actually common current era HIV frequently report without history AIDS-related pulmonary complication age HIV+ population longer exposure smoke HIV . HIV-associated emphysema identify critical area future research recent NIH workshop pulmonary complication HIV . Whether emphysema continue increase HIV+ population HAART era unknown . We hypothesize emphysema may actually increased subject live long chronic pulmonary exposure virus , smoking , inflammation occurs even treat HIV+ patient . We believe prevalence increase compare HIV- control progression accelerate . Assessment degree emphysema distribution accomplish use quantitative CT morphometry density analysis . This technique measure lung density pixel analysis express Hounsfield unit ( HU ) inverse ( ml gas/gram tissue ) increase proportionately magnitude emphysema . These measurement histologically-verified give quantitative , reproducible measurement percentage distribution lung consider normal , mildly emphysematous , severely emphysematous . By add lung image protocol , maximize information gain study minimal increase risk subject inconvenience . Pneumocystis jirovecii Based preliminary data human primate , believe Pneumocystis ( Pc ) one infectious agent critical pathogenesis HIV-associated emphysema . Pneumocystis jirovecii ( formerly know Pneumocystis carinii f. sp . hominis ) [ 19 ] eukaryotic pathogen cause pneumonia immunocompromised host . Despite fact PCP responsible large degree morbidity mortality immunosuppressed population , little understood organism 's epidemiology . The recent development molecular technique identify genotype Pc provide important tool explore epidemiology organism . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) detect low number organisms , particularly case routine histochemical staining method negative [ 21 , 22 ] . Use PCR , particularly nest PCR , detection Pc lead discovery organism among asymptomatic subject . The rate colonization asymptomatic HIV-infected subject appear high see general population estimate range 12 46 % depend subject population respiratory sample study [ 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 22 ] . Evidence link HIV-associated emphysema Pc colonization Pathogenesis HIV-associated emphysema understood . The disease likely multifactorial contribution smoking , HIV infection , subclinical infection . Based several line preliminary data , believe Pc play key role development HIV-associated emphysema . The evidence link Pc emphysema include high rate emphysema Pc colonization HIV-infected smoker , COPD-like change occur PCP , increase Pc colonization COPD correspond disease severity independent smoke history , similarity inflammatory response Pc colonization COPD . The role Pc colonization HIV-associated emphysema test directly . With completion human genome project advance human genetic research , possible u conduct comprehensive population genetic study aim identification genetic factor associate development , outcomes , different disease . Separately , new technology Luminex , microarray , SAGE , proteomic analysis make possible study expression profile thousand gene . Simultaneous development statistical method detect pattern gene expression link pattern clinical outcome , facilitate identification prognostic marker disease ( e.g . breast cancer BRCA-1 , marker tumor metastasis melanoma ) . In particular , study elucidate mechanism disease pathogenesis , well identify target potential therapeutic intervention . It crucial success scientific endeavor link cellular , protein , gene expression genetic data clinical demographic data large substrate subject , interpretation result statistical analysis flaw .</detailed_description>
