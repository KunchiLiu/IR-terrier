The efficacy ( term weight reduction ) add maintenance component focus carbohydrate reduction hunger management compare traditional maintenance . Participants randomly assign either GLB traditional maintenance ( GLB-TM ) GLB carbohydrate reduce maintenance ( GLB-CRM ) . There two group approximately 15 subject intervention assignment , total approximately 30 subject per intervention group approximately 60 subject take part overall . Efficacy group assess pre post-intervention measure diet ( weight loss ) physical activity ( keystone intervention ) , well achievement two goal : 7 % weight loss end 6 month 150 minute physical activity per week . Secondary outcome evaluate include reduction global CVD risk , assess Framingham Score , presence metabolic syndrome ( NCEP ATP III ) , fall blood sugar . Repeat measure obtain six month one year evaluation comparison .</detailed_description>
