	<detailed_description>The study plan last two year . You require make total 6 visit clinic two year study period . At first visit , 12 month , approximately 24 month , bone mineral density test ( BMD ) hip spine . A BMD similar x-ray test measure amount bone . This test take approximately 15 minute . Radiation exposure test low . It estimate total radiation exposure bone mineral density measurement low dental x-ray . At follow visit assessment make side effect whether follow prescribed treatment . Initially , information collect include height , weight , seizure history seizure medication history , medical condition , bone muscle symptom currently , dietary calcium intake , exercise . Blood draw initial 5 follow-up visit . The purpose test blood organ function , calcium level , vitamin D level level marker show high bone turnover . Also visit height weight check asked question regard side effect , adherence treatment quality life . When agree participate , randomize either risedronate 35mg tablet ( Actonel ® ) placebo ( fake pill ) take week . Randomization process equal chance ( like flip coin ) assign either risedronate ( Actonel ® ) placebo . A computer program determine treatment assignment . Also study provide calcium vitamin D tablet take either two three time day depend dietary calcium intake . At first visit assess changeable risk factor osteoporosis . These include smoking , alcohol consumption , lack physical activity , poor nutrition lack vitamin intake . Also , blood drawn see low male hormone . If find low male hormone , refer primary care provider . If low male hormone level , eligible participate study testosterone replacement offer decline treatment . If decide treat testosterone eligible participate study . Education provide exercise bone . If smoke , counsel quit although quit requirement participate study . If drink lot alcohol counsel reduce intake offer help . Reducing quit alcohol requirement participation study . You also meet registered dietician nutritional counseling .</detailed_description>
