	<detailed_description>Dominantly inherit Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) represent less 1 % case AD important model study responsible mutation know biochemical consequence believe underlie pathological basis disorder . Three major hypothesis test : - First , period preclinical ( presymptomatic ) AD individual destine develop early-onset dementia ( gene carrier ) detect change biological fluid neuroimaging correlate comparison individual develop early-onset dementia ( non-carriers ) . - Second , identified causative mutation AD affect normal processing amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) increase brain level amyloid-beta 42 ( Aβ42 ) , sequence preclinical change initially involve Aβ42 ( production clearance ; reduce level cerebrospinal fluid [ CSF ] ) , follow evidence cerebral deposition Aβ42 ( amyloid imaging ) , follow cerebral metabolic activity ( functional imaging ) , finally regional atrophy ( structural imaging ) . - Finally , phenotype symptomatic early-onset familial AD , include clinical course , similar late-onset `` sporadic '' AD . The follow specific aim use test hypothesis : 1 . Maintain establish international DIAN registry individual ( mutation carrier non-carriers ; pre-symptomatic symptomatic ) biological adult child parent know causative mutation AD APP , PSEN1 , PSEN2 gene ass participant every 2 year uniform DIAN protocol . 2 . Maintain integrated DIAN database biospecimen repository disseminate data tissue qualify investigator ( within outside DIAN ) user-friendly manner permit analysis within , , among various data domain include : 1 . In asymptomatic mutation carrier ( use non-carriers control ) , determine temporal order rate intraindividual change clinical , cognitive , behavioral , image , fluid biomarkers AD prior estimate age symptom onset . 2 . In symptomatic mutation carrier , compare clinical neuropathological phenotype ADAD LOAD , use datasets ADNI . 3 . Utilize DIAN cohort database biospecimen repository support new scientific study , include use exome chip technology examine potential modifier age symptomatic onset , exploratory investigation new biomarker analytes , image modality technique , perform exploratory genetic analysis test whether novel AD gene identify GWAS sequence late onset AD case also influence variation age onset change biomarker endophenotypes FAD kindred , generate genome-wide DNA methylation data pilot study perform exploratory analysis look change DNA methylation longitudinal sample DIAN participant . 4 . Provide genetic counseling DIAN participant wish learn mutation status , decide learn status counseling , provide genetic test Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) - approve laboratory ( i.e. , outside DIAN ) .</detailed_description>
