	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving radiation therapy together capecitabine sorafenib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose capecitabine give together sorafenib external-beam radiation therapy see well work treat patient locally advanced rectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine recommend dose neoadjuvant capecitabine give together sorafenib tosylate external-beam radiotherapy patient K-ras mutate , locally advanced rectal cancer . ( Phase I ) - Assess efficacy safety regimen patient . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study capecitabine follow phase II study . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily oral sorafenib tosylate daily day 1-33 . Patients also undergo external-beam radiotherapy daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 . Approximately 6 week completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo surgery . After completion study therapy , patient follow 8 week periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
