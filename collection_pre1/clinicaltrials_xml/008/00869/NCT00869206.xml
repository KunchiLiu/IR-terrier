	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study two different schedule zoledronic acid compare well work reduce bone-related complication patient breast cancer , prostate cancer , multiple myeloma spread place body bone involvement . Bone-related complication major cause morbidity patient metastatic prostate cancer , breast cancer , multiple myeloma . Zoledronic acid may stop growth cancer cell bone may help relieve symptom cause bone metastasis . It yet know whether give zoledronic acid less frequently effective treating patient metastatic cancer spread bone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronic Acid Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer , Metastatic Prostate Cancer , Multiple Myeloma With Bone Involvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether every-12-week therapy zoledronic acid inferior every-4-week therapy patient metastatic breast cancer , metastatic prostate cancer , multiple myeloma involve bone , measure proportion experience least one skeletal related event within 24 month randomization . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare pain score ( Brief Pain Inventory ) patient metastatic breast cancer , metastatic prostate cancer , myeloma involve bone receive every 12 week dose zoledronic acid receive every 4 week dosing . II . To compare functional status ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ ECOG ] performance status ) patient metastatic breast cancer , metastatic prostate cancer , myeloma involve bone receive every 12 week dose zoledronic acid receive every 4 week dosing . III . To compare incidence osteonecrosis jaw patient metastatic breast cancer , metastatic prostate cancer , myeloma involve bone receive every 12 week dose zoledronic acid receive every 4 week dosing . IV . To compare incidence renal dysfunction patient metastatic breast cancer , metastatic prostate cancer , myeloma involve bone receive every 12 week dose zoledronic acid receive every 4 week dosing . V. To compare skeletal morbidity rate patient , define number skeletal-related event per year , patient receive every 12 week dose receive every 4 week dosing . VI . To compare suppression serum marker bone resorption patient metastatic breast cancer , metastatic prostate cancer , myeloma involve bone receive every 12 week dose zoledronic acid receive every 4 week dosing . VII . To determine whether every 12 week therapy zoledronic acid inferior every-4-week therapy subgroup patient either breast cancer , prostate cancer , multiple myeloma , measure proportion experience least one skeletal related event within 24 month randomization . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive zoledronic acid intravenously ( IV ) least 15 minute every 4 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive zoledronic acid IV least 15 minute every 12 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 week 2 year registration .</detailed_description>
