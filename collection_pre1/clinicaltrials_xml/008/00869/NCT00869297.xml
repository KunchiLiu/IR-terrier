	<brief_summary>Fluid management surgical patient change dramatically recent year . Recent study show call 'restrictive ' fluid strategy improve outcomes length stay time fitness discharge . Furthermore , new monitoring technology develop allow clinician good monitor effect intravenous fluid therapy . The fluid management free flap reconstruction surgery controversial . As vasoactive agent use anesthetic preferred intervention treatment hypotension , fluid therapy often administer correct hemodynamic instability . A liberal fluid strategy may predispose flap edema , venous congestion ultimately flap failure . A restrictive fluid strategy however ( institution ) anecdotally report lead high incidence deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolus ( PE ) . Thus , clinical equipoise optimal fluid management patient . Non-invasive cardiac output ( CO ) monitoring base arterial pulse contour nascent technological advance widely validate operating theatre . The calculation CO base assumption stroke volume proportional integral area arterial pressure versus time curve . With monitor , variation stroke volume mechanical ventilation also calculate utilized estimate patient 's volume status . A stroke volume variation ( SVV ) less 15 % show indicative patient longer volume responsive . In study , plan recruit patient undergo microvascular free flap reconstruction . Patients randomize either standard care , goal direct fluid therapy . All patient receive pre-operative 5 ml kg-1 bolus normal saline . Subsequently , patient receive lactate ringer rate 5 ml kg-1 hr-1 . Patients intervention group CO SVV monitor Flo-Trac pulse contour monitor ( Edwards Life Sciences , Irvine , CA ) . Patients intervention group receive 6 % tetrastarch bolus ( Voluven , Fresenius Kabi , Hamburg , Germany ) SVV exceed 15 % . Patients control arm receive fluid rate type discretion attend anesthesiologist maintain hemodynamic stability urine output 0.5 ml kg-1 hr-1 . Intra-operative variable study include total fluid administer ( colloid crystalloid ) , urine output , SVV CO ( start end surgery ) . Postoperative variable examine urine output , daily fluid balance ( day 0-3 ) , incidence DVT , PE , pulmonary edema , rate re-operation , daily serum creatinine , chloride bicarbonate concentration , incidence flap failure . Measurements flap oxygenation water content make near infrared spectroscopy baseline , immediate post-operative period ( day 1-7 ) . We hypothesize goal direct group would intra-operative colloid give reduce incidence adverse outcome .</brief_summary>
