	<brief_summary>D-ribose , natural occur pentose carbohydrate , repeatedly show enhance high-energy phosphate improve function follow ischemia , state congestive heart failure , recently subject lung disease . An initial preliminary , open label pilot study demonstrate positive benefit D-ribose `` Baby-Boomer '' subject age 50 65 year old complaining persistent fatigue . The objective study build previously collect data evaluate oral D-ribose vs. dextrose ( administered supplement ) relatively healthy , yet fatigue subject goal improve state fatigue .</brief_summary>
