	<detailed_description>An intramuscular injectable formulation risperidone long-acting formulation development aim provide sustain stable level risperidone treatment cycle give every 4 week . As formulation long act formulation , patient treat 1 mg immediate release ( IR ) formulation first week confirm patient develop allergic reaction drug receive long act injectable ( LAI ) formulation . Each patient receive total two injection . The first one immediate release formulation second one , give least week later , new long act formulation . Eligible patient stay previous oral medication , taper medication need . Blood sample collect determine level risperidone major metabolite plasma . Blood sample obtain venipuncture ( needle stick ) immediately ( pre-dose ) 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 45 min , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8,12 , 16 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 72 , 96 hour 1st injection 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 96 hr , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 , 39 , 43 , 50 , 57 , 64 , 71 , 78 , 85 day second injection risperidone . Safety assess visit throughout study monitoring score Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI-S ) , score Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale ( ESRS ) , adverse event ( AE ) , change clinical laboratory result , change physical examination ( PE ) , change electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) , well patient investigator evaluation injection site . The study two period . In first period patient receive one injection 1 mg risperidone IR ( immediate release ) solution ( liquid ) . The follow-up duration 96 hour . In second period , patient receive one injection risperidone 4-week formulation 75 mg . The follow-up duration 85 day . The injection , administer muscle buttock , give 7 14 day apart .</detailed_description>
