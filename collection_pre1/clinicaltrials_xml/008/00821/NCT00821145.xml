	<detailed_description>In many country gold standard treat abdominal aortic aneurysm still open surgery long incision . In patient suitable anatomy alternatively endovascular approach chosen . Since open surgery durable many country laparoscopic procedure use `` key hole surgery `` gain wide acceptance . The current study want prove laparoscopic aortic aneurysm procedure less invasive open surgery reduce recovery time . Study design : Multi center prospective randomize study include patient infra juxtarenal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) . In group I AAA resect use conventional long incision standard procedure resect AAA . A Dacron graft use inlay technique restore blood flow . In group II total laparoscopic approach choose exclude AAA . Identical open surgery dacron graft laparoscopically sawn exclude AAA restore blood flow . In subgroup II laparoscopic anastomosis perform stapling device simplify accelerate procedure . Endpoints study : Total operating time , aortic crossclamping time , stay ICU , return regular diet , postoperative ileus , total hospital stay , major minor complication , blood loss , renal function case juxtarenal AAA.Patients evaluate postoperative pain , wound relate problem , hernias time full mobilisation achieve . Hypothesis : The laparoscopic approach though associated long operating time longer clamp time associate reduced recovery time , les pain less wound relate problem compare full length conventional incision .</detailed_description>
