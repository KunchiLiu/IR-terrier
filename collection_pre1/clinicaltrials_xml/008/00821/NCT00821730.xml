Less know specific educational need family member friends individual newly diagnose inflammatory arthritis . II . Purpose Objectives The purpose study explore learning need individual inflammatory arthritis perspective family member friends inflammatory arthritis . In particular , study aim explore type support patient family feel would helpful upon diagnosis . Specific objective study include : - examine learning preference family member friends individual inflammatory arthritis , include thought peer support , - identify specific informational need related manage arthritis , - explore learning need change time duration disease . Objectives address semi-structured interview family member friends patient Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre rheumatology clinic . III . Methodology In order meet objective , perspective family member friends individual inflammatory arthritis explore use qualitative approach . In particular , semi-structured interview use . III . A. Semi-structured Interviews Study Design Semi-structured interview conduct key informant , define individual good knowledge understand disease family member friend inflammatory arthritis clearly articulate knowledge . These interview serve investigative technique gather data short period time gain new insight broad perspective view research question . Although specific question ask manner interview , interviewer free alter order question ask interview caters towards individual research participant . An interview guide ( Appendix A ) develop purpose study , interview note form ( Appendix B ) use interview . As semi-structured interview approach , certain probe question aim encourage research participant elaborate response discussion include guide . Such probe question context-dependent evolve interview take place . Detailed field note record interview , use interview note form ( Appendix B ) guide . Digital recorder use record interview . All digital audio file transcribe verbatim . All field note digital audio file upload NVivo8 , qualitative data management software serve assist analysis , synthesis , management data . Data transcription outsource . A data transfer agreement put place Sunnybrook Research Administration . Data interpret interview . Additional question may add interview guide subsequent interview . Data collect approximately 10 15 research participant interview , enough information gather saturation data obtain - i.e. , new concept arise data . Each interview anticipate last approximately one hour , conduct second-year medical student train study coordinator expertise qualitative research . Subjects Potential research participant identify participation study base follow inclusion criterion : - Participants must family member care-giving friend individual diagnose inflammatory arthritis establish physician ; - Participants must age 18 year old ; - Participants must able participate 1 hour interview ; - Participants must able understand converse English . Recruitment Consent Process Individuals identify Dr. Mary Bell ( Principal Investigator ) rheumatology clinic Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre . A flyer ( Appendix H ) give patient PI pas friend family member would include information study contact study team interested participating . Upon contact study team , Dr. Bell identify screen family member patient accord eligibility criterion study initiate inform consent process ( Appendix C ) . Dr. Bell introduce project review information letter ( Appendix D ) study consent form ( Appendix C ) eligible patient . This do ensure potential research participant understand purpose study ask . When individual verbally agree participate , his/her name forward Office Manager clinic contact individual schedule interview Dr. Bell 's rheumatology clinic office medical student co-investigator assign project . A confirmation letter ( Appendix E ) Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre letterhead sign Dr. Bell mail potential research participant ; include time location interview . One day prior schedule interview , medical student telephone individual remind time location interview use standardize telephone script ( Appendix F ) . At begin interview , prior ask question , medical student review consent form , answer question person may subsequently obtain write consent individual prior commence interview . Once write consent obtain , copy provide research participant . IV . Data Analysis A constant comparative method ( Strauss Corbin , 1998 ) use describe learning need use open-coding method . Transcripts interview independently categorize two member research team . Each team member first analyze data independently meet compare come understanding common emergent theme may arise interview . Each transcript compare consensus reach code assign particular unit text . A coding scheme evolve data analysis progress theme derive synthesis . V. Risks Benefits There know risk associate study . Participants interview may benefit question may answer off-the-record interview . Potential indirect benefit include improvement care provide individual inflammatory arthritis , particularly perspective family member friend , opportunity share experience family member friends individual inflammatory arthritis . VI . Privacy Confidentiality Only Principal Investigator member research team conduct interview know identity research participant . Confidentiality ensure assign research participant unique identify number upon agree participate study . The list name , address , phone number correspond study number identify information keep password-protected computer secure server lock research room . All information obtain study hold strict confidence , electronic data password-protected stored secure server lock research room . No names identify information use publication presentation , transfer outside researcher study . All hard copy data store locked research room Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre . Data retain 25 year state protocol inform consent form . VI . Compensation No monetary remuneration provide . However , transportation cost cover ( e.g. , subway token , taxi fare , park ) refreshment provide ( see Appendix G budget ) . VIII . Communication Results Results study disseminate research participant . Results communicate academic health professional audience scientific publication presentation finding . No identify information contain report presentation . All result present keep privacy confidentiality issue address section VI . A presentation base finding give second year medical student University Toronto . Information give within presentation share course coordinator Determinants Community Health Year 2 course Faculty Medicine University Toronto . Reports make available upon request .</detailed_description>
