	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial examine safety gene therapy Lebers Congenital Amaurosis ( LCA ) cause RPE65 mutation use recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 ( rAAV2 ) vector carry human RPE65 ( hRPE65 ) gene . Recently , three independent short-term gene therapy study human LCA due RPE65 mutation publish , suggest subretinal delivery rAAV virus carry RPE65 gene safe . As secondary outcome , improvement visual function observe seven first nine treat patient . The propose study similar open label , Phase I clinical trial uniocular subretinal rAAV2-hRPE65 administration individual RPE65-associated retinal disease . Two cohort three subject one cohort four subject include trial . Cohort 1 2 consist individual 18 year age old Cohorts 3 consist individual 8 year age old . In cohort 2 , large volume vector administer . Enrollment Cohort 3 begin confirm safety rAAV2-hRPE65 administration old group participant .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Retinal disease cause homozygous compound heterozygote RPE65 mutation ; Clinical diagnosis Leber congenital amaurosis ( LCA ) severely impaired visual retinal function , best correct visual acuity 20/50 worse study eye ; Ability perform test visual retinal function ; Good general health ; Ability comply research procedure ; Specific Cohort 1 2 : 18 year age older ; Specific Cohort 3 : Over 8 year age ; Immune deficiency use immunosuppressive medication ; Preexisting eye condition would preclude plan surgery interfere interpretation study endpoint ( example , glaucoma ocular medium opacity ) ; Complicating systemic disease ; Impaired coagulation use antiplatelet agent within 7 day prior study agent administration ; Pregnancy breastfeeding ; Individuals ( male female ) childbearing potential unwilling use effective contraception 1 year follow agent administration barrier contraception 3 month follow agent administration ; Any condition would prevent subject complete followup examination course study ; Any condition , opinion investigator , make subject unsuitable study ; Current recent participation research protocol involve investigational agent therapy , include recent ( within past 6 month ) receipt investigational biologic therapeutic agent . Subjects exclude base gender , race ethnicity .</criteria>
