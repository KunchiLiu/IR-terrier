	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate benefit ARV treatment patient , family member patient ARV treatment , community large . The study also aim investigate impact peer adherence support nutritional intervention measure treatment success . To end , 648 patient commence ARV treatment past month twelve select health care facility recruit study . In addition , 204 randomly sample household community serve twelve select clinic recruit study . Trained enumerator baseline conduct semi-structured interview patient household . Following baseline survey , patient recruit study randomly assign one three group : - Patients receive ARV treatment associate support currently provide public sector ARV treatment programme . - Patients receive ( ) plus bi-weekly visit experience ARV patient train peer adherence supporter - Patients receive ( ) ( b ) plus weekly nutritional supplement form two 400g can meatball spaghetti tomato sauce The group 'comparison ' household comprises fourth group . Trained enumerator conduct follow-up interview patient household approximately six- twelve-months respectively . In addition , ARV coordinator provider work ARV treatment programme twelve select health care facility interview trained enumerator , baseline six- twelve-months . Clinical data obtain patient file baseline completion study . Using data , various outcome importance study compare four study group , use experimental non-experimental method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study three main objective , set specific aim : Objective 1 : Present broad view treatment success In order achieve objective , study aim : - Investigate access antiretroviral treatment nutritional supplementation impact labour productivity time allocation patient household member - Investigate access antiretroviral treatment nutritional supplementation impact household welfare - Investigate access antiretroviral treatment nutritional supplementation impact educational health outcome child household patient antiretroviral treatment Objective 2 : Develop model determinant treatment success In order achieve objective , study aim : - Determine various individual , household facility-level characteristic impact adherence antiretroviral treatment , include access disability grant - Determine access peer adherence supporter nutritional supplementation impact adherence antiretroviral treatment - Estimate cost-effectiveness intervention enhancement adherence , fiscal social perspective Objective 3 : Understand link treatment prevention In order achieve objective , study aim : - Determine access antiretroviral treatment impact uptake voluntary counsel test among member household include patient ARV treatment among member household general community - Determine access antiretroviral treatment , peer adherence supporter nutritional supplementation impact sexual behaviour patient antiretroviral treatment , household member , member households general community The study aim investigate effective AIDS treatment support setting free ARV treatment introduce already , issue scale-up sustainability result represent important issue . The study therefore conduct twelve phase I ARV assessment site Free State province , i.e . sit ARV treatment first become available ARV treatment programme launch Free State province 2004/05 . 1 . Type study The study prospective , cohort study patient , household , facility provider survey component . The study social scientific focus , clinical component , comprise two behavioural intervention . 2 . Description experimental design The study combination group time-series quasi-experimental design variation double randomised consent design . The study comprise four group household , three include patient ARV treatment ( Figure 1 ) . The provision ARV treatment represent quasi- field experiment , peer adherence support nutritional intervention represent randomised-control experiment execute accordance Zelen-type double randomise consent design . This study design deem appropriate give fact : blinding practicable possible ; use classical randomisation inform consent procedure significantly threaten internal validity ; intervention highly attractive ; control group receive standard care ; study focus clinically relevant objective ( ) offer important new insight ( Kaptchuk , 2001 ; MacLehose et al , 2001 ; Rains &amp; Penzien , 2005 ) . Figure 1 : Experimental study design Group A : Households include ARV patient receive ARV treatment associate support provide part government 's ARV treatment programme Sample size : n~216 ] Group B : Households include ARV patient receive ARV treatment associate support provide part government 's ARV treatment programme PLUS Adherence support provide trained peer adherence supporter twice weekly visit patient [ Sample size : n~216 ] Group C : Households include ARV patient receive ARV treatment associate support provide part government 's ARV treatment programme PLUS Adherence support provide trained peer adherence supporter twice weekly visit patient PLUS Nutritional supplementation : weekly delivery two 400g can meatball spaghetti tomato sauce peer adherence supporter [ Sample size : n~216 ] Group D : Randomly select household general community serve select health facility , exclude household someone know receive ARV treatment [ Sample size : n~180 ] Sample size estimation : The sample size calculation arm study base method propose Freedman ( 1982 ) . The sample size estimation base follow assumption : - The proportion people show improvement specific outcome , compare across two arm study time . - Attrition control group comparison household assume minimal none ( since ARV patient household ) , attrition intervention arm ( ARV treatment consider intervention ) assume much high , give report mortality 10 % among ARV patient first month treatment ( Free State Department Health , 2006 ) . - The required sample size 4-equal-arms-at-end-of-study design calculate take account attrition rate 17 % three intervention group ratio 1 treatment : control arm end study expect . - Assuming two-tailed test Type I error 5 % , Type II error 10 % , least 17 % improvement outcome . The affordable sample size 801 household 177 control arm 208 intervention arm . This sample expect yield statistically significant result analysis measure contemplate . Although statistical power study design sample size consider good sample size round ~828 household , ~180 households control arm ~216 household intervention arm . This do represent multiples 12 since study conduct 12 facility . 3 . Method randomisation From among ~648 ARV patient recruit study [ ~54/study site ] , individual patient assign randomly control group [ Group A ; n~216 ] two experimental arm study [ Group B &amp; C ; n~216 ] , use relevant random sample selection command version 10 Stata software programme .</detailed_description>
