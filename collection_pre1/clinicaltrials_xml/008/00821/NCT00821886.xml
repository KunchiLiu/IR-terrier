	<brief_summary>In phase II trial investigator propose evaluate ixabepilone combination carboplatin trastuzumab neoadjuvant therapy locally advance breast cancer patient . Patients early stage , HER2-positive breast cancer receive six cycle neoadjuvant treatment ixabepilone , carboplatin , trastuzumab every three week prior surgery ; surgery , patient continue treatment trastuzumab every three week week 52 . Concomitant post-operative trastuzumab treatment , patient hormone receptor-positive tumor receive anti-estrogen treatment . Also , completion chemotherapy , patient may receive radiation treatment discretion physician .</brief_summary>
