	<brief_summary>Renovo , Biopharmaceutical company involve development drug improve appearance scar enhance wound healing , propose carry research improve appearance exist scar 2-6 month old use Juvista . Juvista previously administer pre-existing scar without surgical revision , think beneficial effect see Juvista previous trial may also see administer exist scar whilst scar maturing . This proof concept study therefore investigate effect Juvista Caucasian male female patient administered scar two six month old . Scarring skin vary hugely individual ; therefore reliable way assess efficacy improvement scar appearance use model patient act control . A placebo also use trial currently approve pharmaceutical improvement scar . A total 20 patient allocate one two dose group . Patients enter study linear scar result broken skin ( e.g . trauma , surgery ) 7 20cm length , well meet specific criterion . The scar treat divided two equal segment . Each segment receive intradermal injection Juvista placebo Day 0 24 hour later . The measure change scar appearance perform use colour analysis ass change colour Juvista treat segment versus placebo treat segment scar , reference surround skin within patient .</brief_summary>
