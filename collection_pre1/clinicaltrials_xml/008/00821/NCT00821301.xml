	<brief_title>Study Fluphenazine Relapsed Relapsed-and-Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , dose-escalating , Phase 1b trial patient relapse relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma . Patients dose Days 1 8 21 day cycle . This study conduct two part . In Part 1 , MTD determine portion study , patient enrol cohort 3 patient dose level . At least 3 patient complete 21 day dose level evaluate safety tolerability additional patient treat high dos . Doses increase follow modify Fibonacci scheme . In Part 2 , twelve additional patient enrol MTD determine Part 1 ( dose high dose cohort complete MTD reach ) evaluate safety , tolerability , preliminary efficacy dose regimen . Serum fluphenazine pharmacokinetic study perform first cycle therapy Part 1 Part 2 consent patient .</detailed_description>
