	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria Patients must histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC . Patients must metastatic disease , stage IIIB malignant pleural effusion , otherwise unsuitable potentially curative therapy due bulk disease comorbid medical illness . There must disease apparent image offer medical indication radiation therapy . Palliative radiotherapy would offer appropriate standard therapy outside study setting . ( NOTE : Radiotherapy utilized regimen would offer standard treatment outside study ) . Indications palliative radiation include pain , pathologic fracture risk fracture , lymphovascular obstruction , bronchial obstruction , neural impingement , dyspnea , bleed . There must measurable tumor target ( visible , palpable , radiographically evident ) palliative radiation . The target radiotherapy must thoracic region ( i.e. , must normal lung tissue anatomic level ) . Previous systemic therapy NSCLC allow , long prior therapy complete least two week enrollment . Patients treat nitrosurea radioisotope may enrol unless treatment least 6 week prior enrollment . Patients must previous expose HDAC inhibitor ( patient previously treat valproic acid eligible exposure great 30 day prior enrollment ) . Age ≥18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use vorinostat alone , combination radiation patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . ECOG performance status ≤3 Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define , laboratory value obtain within 2 week prior enrollment : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL hemoglobin ≥9 g/ dL serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) serum AST , ALT , ALP &lt; 2.5 time ULN serum Creatinine &lt; 1.5 time ULN serum Potassium , Magnesium , Calcium within normal range The effect radiation develop human fetus know teratogenic . For reason , woman childbearing potential sexually active men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Ability swallow capsule Patients must CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis ( PET/CT body ) , well MRI contrast CT brain within 30 day enrollment Patients know , untreated brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients receive whole brain radiotherapy within 2 week enrollment also exclude . Patients treat investigational drug trial within 30 day study enrollment . Patients active grade 2 great acute toxicity relate prior cancerdirected therapy History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition vorinostat , patient history unanticipated severe normal tissue reaction previous radiation treatment . Patients congenital long QTsyndrome exclude , know side effect vorinostat prolongation QT interval . Patients antiarrhythmic medication medication know lead prolonged QT interval exclude unless ECG obtain document normal QT interval within 90 day prior enrollment . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection ( fever &gt; 38ºC within 48 hour enrollment ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( i.e. , NYHA class 3 great ) , unstable angina pectoris , coronary angioplasty within 6 month prior enrollment , cardiac arrhythmia . Additionally , patient suspect confirmed poor compliance , mental instability , prior current alcohol drug abuse deem investigator likely affect ability sign inform consent , undergo study procedure exclude . Pregnant woman exclude study radiation potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother vorinostat , breastfeed discontinue mother treat . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior enrollment . Patients active HIV viral hepatitis . Patients primary radiation therapy , potentially curative intent , indicate exclude .</criteria>
