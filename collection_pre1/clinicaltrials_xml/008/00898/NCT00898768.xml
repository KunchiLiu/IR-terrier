	<detailed_description>Lynch syndrome ( LS ) , hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) , autosomal dominantly inherit disorder characterize high risk early-onset colorectal endometrial cancer increase risk cancer , include cancer stomach , ovary , urinary tract , hepatobiliary tract , pancreas small bowel . LS cause germline mutation one mismatch repair ( MMR ) gene , mostly hMLH1 , hMSH2 hMSH6 . Recently , several study , include one Netherlands , evaluate life-time risk small bowel cancer ( SBC ) LS patient . From study life-time risk SBC estimate around 4 % . This similar life-time risk colorectal cancer general population , screen generally advise . The risk SBC increase age , estimate prevalence 1:500 age 40 , rise estimate prevalence around 1:70 age 60 . Compared general population , LS patient SBC generally present 10-20 year earlier patient sporadic SBC sixth seventh decade life . The localisation SBC LS almost equal duodenum jejunum , localisation ileum generally occur low frequency.Until , screen small bowel neoplasia Lynch syndrome patient generally recommend . However , development two new technique visualize small intestine raise question whether screen might useful advisable . Small bowel capsule endoscopy ( CE ) develop safe , patient-friendly , minimally invasive modality visualization small bowel . In addition , double-balloon enteroscopy ( DBE ) develop , technique allow endotherapeutic intervention . The diagnostic yield technique markedly higher conventional method , push-enteroscopy enteroclysis . To date , study perform screen small bowel neoplasia Lynch syndrome patient mean technique . The primary aim study determine prevalence incidence small bowel neoplasia Lynch syndrome patient use small bowel CE DBE . Secondary objective : The secondary aim identify risk factor small bowel pathology useful clinical practice identify patient might benefit screen determine additional interventional risk associate endoscopic procedure . This national multi-centre study evaluate yield small bowel screen use capsule endoscopy double balloon enteroscopy Lynch syndrome subject . The intervention consist perform capsule endoscopy procedure baseline 2-year follow-up . In patient polyps malignant appear abnormality capsule endoscopy , double balloon enteroscopy perform subsequent endoscopic surgical removal neoplastic lesion .</detailed_description>
