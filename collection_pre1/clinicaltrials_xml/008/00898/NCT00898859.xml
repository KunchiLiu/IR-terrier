	<detailed_description>Smoking large risk factor development COPD . It show patient COPD smoke induces airway inflammation characterize bronchial infiltration neutrophil , macrophage , lymphocytes mast cell . In addition , smoke accelerates lung function loss increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness , symptom , even mortality COPD . When inhaled , tobacco smoke first encounter airway epithelium , form barrier environmental substance limit access subepithelial layer . There suggestive evidence impair repair response loss epithelial integrity airway play crucial role pathogenesis contribute tissue remodel COPD . Remodeling airway epithelium , e.g. , squamous metaplasia mucous hyperplasia , often observed COPD . Metalloproteases ( MMPs ) A Disintegrin Metalloproteinase ( ADAM ) may play important role respiratory disease . MMPs ADAMs , class membrane-bound MMPs , form family enzyme involve degrade extracellular matrix ( ECM ) component . Their proteolytic activity involve remodel ECM , require migration repair process regulate tissue turn-over . However , aberrant activity lead tissue destruction irreversible damage . Thus MMPs , ADAMs may play important role respiratory diseases protease-antiprotease imbalance may contribute airway remodel impaired epithelial repair COPD . In addition , MMPs/ADAMs act regulatory event inflammation airway remodel liberate adhesion molecule shed growth factor cytokines cell surface . Furthermore , ADAMs play role cell-cell cell-matrix interaction so-called disintegrin domain . In epithelial cell , MMPs ADAMs know regulate intercellular contact , cell-matrix contact , migratory response , shed cytokines/growth factor , intracellular signaling pathway . Since increase MMP level ( e.g. , MMP-9 , 12 ) observe COPD exacerbation polymorphisms specific ADAM gene ( i.e. , ADAM33 ) associate COPD susceptibility , activation MMPs ADAMs airway epithelium may play important role pathogenesis COPD . Reactive oxygen specie present cigarette smoke may activate Duox , lead activation ADAM17 airway epithelial cell . ADAM17 describe involved release growth factor ( TGF-α ) , lead release proinflammatory cytokine ( IL-8 ) production MUC5AC 10-13 . TGF-α act EGF receptor ( EGFR ) , involve production MUC5AC goblet cell hyperplasia . IL-8 well-known chemo-attractant neutrophil , thus may play central role neutrophilic inflammation COPD , lead ROS production , release neutrophil elastase emphysema . Despite emerge implication ADAMs ( MMPs ) disease progression , mechanisms lead activation specific ADAMs ( MMPs ) action COPD still incompletely understood . In current study , aim investigate effect cigarette smoke cellular parameter relevant development COPD involvement ADAM activity effect . By study effect ADAM inhibition , aim provide novel insight role ADAMs development COPD , may offer new therapeutic target treatment COPD .</detailed_description>
