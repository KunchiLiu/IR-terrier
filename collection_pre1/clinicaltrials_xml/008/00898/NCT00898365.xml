	<brief_title>Study Kidney Tumors Younger Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Classify patient renal tumor histological categorization , surgico-pathological stage , presence metastasis , age diagnosis , tumor weight , loss heterozygosity chromosomes 1p 16q , define eligibility series therapeutic study . ( Loss heterozygosity [ LOH ] test discontinue April 2014 ) II . Maintain biological sample bank make specimen available scientist evaluate additional potential biological prognostic variable conduct research scientist . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Monitor outcome patient eligible subsequent therapeutic study . II . Describe whether pulmonary tumor burden correlate outcome stage IV patient . III . Describe sensitivity specificity abdominal compute tomography ( CT ) comparison surgical pathologic finding identification local tumor spread beyond renal capsule adjacent muscle organ , lymph node involvement renal hilum retroperitoneum , preoperative tumor rupture , metastases liver . IV . Compare sensitivity specificity pre-operative abdominal CT scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) identification differentiation nephrogenic rest Wilms ' tumor child multiple renal lesion . V. Correlate method conception ( natural v assist reproductive technology ) development Wilms ' tumor . VI . To evaluate frequency integrase interactor 1 ( INI1 ) mutation renal extrarenal malignant rhabdoid tumor kidney determine incidence germline inherit versus somatic mutation facilitate clinical correlation companion study AREN0321 . ( INI1 test discontinue April 2014 ) OUTLINE : Tumor tissue , blood , urine sample collect research study , include immunohistochemistry . CT scan MRIs also perform . Loss heterozygosity analysis ( chromosome 1p 16q ) perform extraction DNA . DNA polymorphisms assay polymerase chain reaction use standard methodology . Leftover specimens archived future study . ( LOH INI1 test discontinue April 2014 ) Patients follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
