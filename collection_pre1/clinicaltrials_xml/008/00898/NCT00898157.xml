	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tissue patient cancer laboratory may help doctor identify learn biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor understand patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This laboratory study look biomarkers use tissue sample old patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treat combination chemotherapy without rituximab clinical trial ECOG-E4494 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Biomarkers Using Tissue Samples From Older Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Treated With Combination Chemotherapy With Without Rituximab Clinical Trial ECOG-E4494</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To construct tissue microarrays ( TMA ) use tissue sample old patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treat standard CHOP chemotherapy ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ) without rituximab clinical trial ECOG-E4494 . - To allow TMA resource include large international effort ( Lunenburg Lymphoma Biomarker Consortium [ LLBC ] ) , partner several similar randomize trial ( EORTC , HOVON , GELA , MINT ) order properly power bring standardization study biomarkers lymphoma . - To evaluate clinical impact prognostic importance number biomarkers , include Bcl-2 , Bcl-6 , CD10 , FOXP1 , MUM1 , Ki-67 , CD5 , HLA-Dr. - To determine prognostic impact clinical International Prognostic Index ( IPI ) variables large international study . - To determine relationship different biomarkers clinical predictor . - To establish TMA ( use tissue sample patient treat clinical trial ECOG-E4494 ) resource future ECOG-driven study validation novel biomarkers become recognize available . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord prior treatment ( CHOP chemotherapy [ cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ] CHOP-like chemotherapy v CHOP chemotherapy without rituximab ) . Tissue microarrays construct use tissue sample previously collect patient treated clinical trial ECOG-E4494 . Tissue microarrays use biomarker study .</detailed_description>
