	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Collecting store sample blood exhale breath patient cancer healthy participant study laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . PURPOSE : This research study collect analyze sample blood exhale breath patient high risk lung cancer healthy participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serum Exhaled Breath Condensate MALDI-MS Lung Cancer . ( SPORE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate ability proteomic pattern serum exhale breath condensate sample detect discriminate lung cancer healthy high-risk individual . - To correlate proteomic pattern tumor behavior . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Blood exhale breath condensate sample collect , whenever possible , time medically indicated purpose ( e.g. , work-up , pre-op , surgical procedure ) . The sample use produce genetic material ( i.e. , DNA , RNA ) molecular material ( i.e. , protein ) store future study , include study may relate lung cancer . Future genetic study relate lung cancer may include study protein expression pattern via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time flight mass spectrometry may serve predictive molecular marker lung cancer . Participants complete 15-minute Lung Spore Database questionnaire time study enrollment provide information demographic ( e.g. , date birth , address , phone number ) , medical smoking history , personal family history cancer cancer treatment , current medication . Medical record review time study enrollment approximately 5 year obtain information , include test result , associated diagnosis cancer . Participants may also contact phone late time answer question health status .</detailed_description>
