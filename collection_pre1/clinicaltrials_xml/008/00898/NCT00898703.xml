	<brief_title>Studying Blood Samples Women With Breast Cancer History Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare peripheral blood ( PB ) concentration circulate endothelial cell ( CEC ) woman measurable , active breast cancer PB concentration CEC control population woman history breast cancer currently without evidence active disease . Secondary - To compare woman measurable breast cancer relationship PB concentration CEC prior 3 6 week follow initiation new chemotherapy hormonal therapy , correlate value clinical response treatment determine CEC use tumor marker indicator disease burden . - To compare PB concentration CEC level plasma protein associate angiogenesis , include vascular endothelial growth factor , woman active prior history breast cancer . OUTLINE : Peripheral blood plasma sample collect analysis circulate endothelial cell ( CEC ) angiogenic growth factor level . Blood sample patient initiate new chemotherapy hormonal therapy breast cancer collect baseline 3 6 week follow start treatment . CEC quantify via flow cytometry plasma angiogenic marker assess via ELISA . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 100 patient active , measurable breast cancer 100 patient prior history breast cancer accrue study .</detailed_description>
