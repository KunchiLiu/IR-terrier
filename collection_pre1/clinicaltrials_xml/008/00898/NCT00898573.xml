	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue blood patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn cancer development drug resistance patient . PURPOSE : This research study look lapatinib resistance patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Resistance Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To identify secondary ErbB2 mutation tumor tissue sample patient ErbB2-positive breast cancer treat lapatinib ditosylate . - To investigate ErbB2 copy number change expression level . - To determine abnormality pathway ( e.g. , c-MET PI3K ) potential mechanism resistance . OUTLINE : Previously collect tumor tissue samples* obtain genetic analysis study . Samples analyze secondary ErbB2 mutation nest PCR ; ErbB2 copy number change quantitative PCR standard histological FISH ; ErbB2 expression level quantitative RT-PCR IHC . Patients also undergo blood sample collection extraction DNA ( normal control DNA ) isolation EpCAM-positive circulate tumor cell use immunomagnetic cell separation technology . Additional research study may include mutational amplification analysis c-MET PI3K pathway . NOTE : *Patients may undergo biopsy post-treatment tumor tissue sample unavailable .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Pathologically confirm invasive breast cancer ErbB2positive disease Has receive currently receive lapatinib ditosylate Documented clinical benefit receive lapatinib ditosylate ( e.g. , stable disease ≥ 12 week duration OR radiographic response ) Must tumor tissue sample available research study Hormone receptor status specify PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Menopausal status specify Not pregnant* Coagulation profile normal* Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm³* NOTE : *For patient require posttreatment biopsy PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics Concurrent chemotherapy trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) allow No concurrent anticoagulant , include warfarin lowmolecular weight heparin* No concurrent antiplatelet therapy , include aspirin , clopidogrel , antiplatelet agents* NOTE : *For patient require posttreatment biopsy</criteria>
