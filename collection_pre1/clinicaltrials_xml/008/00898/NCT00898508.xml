	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Collecting store sample blood tumor tissue patient cancer test laboratory may help study cancer future . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study blood tumor tissue sample woman invasive breast cancer , ductal carcinoma situ , lobular carcinoma situ , benign breast disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Blood Tumor Tissue Samples Women With Invasive Breast Cancer , Ductal Lobular Carcinoma Situ , Benign Breast Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To establish specimen bank peripheral blood specimen collect woman full spectrum breast disease ( invasive breast cancer [ IBC ] , ductal lobular carcinoma situ [ CIS ] , benign breast disease [ BBD ] ) standardize clinical follow serial specimen collection IBC . - To determine ability quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR ( qRT-PCR ) discriminate patient IBC , CIS , BBD compare baseline assay value pre-biopsy specimen histologic diagnosis . - To determine ability qRT-PCR predict treatment response compare serial assay value patient evaluable IBC objective response . - To determine ability qRT-PCR predict relapse compare serial assay value patient IBC disease status . - To determine ability qRT-PCR perform independent prognostic factor compare baseline assay value patient IBC disease status , stratify know breast cancer prognostic factor . Secondary - To perform exploratory study identify potential target novel nucleic acid proteomic-based early detection assay . OUTLINE : Patients undergo baseline peripheral blood specimen collection pre-biopsy periodically 10 year . Specimens analyze circulate tumor cell via quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR , immunofluorescence , bidirectional pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization allele-specific amplification ; protein profile via mass spectometry , liquid chromatography , enzyme digestion , tandem mass spectometry . Patients ' tumor tissue ( invasive breast cancer [ IBC ] ) analyze p53 via IHC . Medical record review periodically . Patients IBC complete quality life assessment baseline every 6 month 10 year .</detailed_description>
