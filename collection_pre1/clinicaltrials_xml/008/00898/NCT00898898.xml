	<brief_title>Studying Tissue Samples From Women With Breast Cancer Who Were Treated Clinical Trial NCCTG-N9831</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine association primary breast tumor protein expression MYC , IGF-1R , PTEN disease-free survival ( DFS ) patient randomize clinical trial NCCTG-N9831 . II . To determine association primary breast tumor amplification status MYC TOP2A DFS patient randomize NCCTG-N9831 . III . To determine association primary breast tumor mutation status PIK3 DFS patient randomize NCCTG-N9831 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine association primary breast tumor marker protein expression/amplification/mutation status aforementioned marker overall survival patient randomize NCCTG-N9831 . II . To investigate predictive potential multiple marker analyse DFS overall survival use multivariate analysis . III . To determine correlation protein expression amplification status MYC patient randomize NCCTG-N9831 . IV . To determine correlation marker protein expression/amplification/mutation status know clinicopathological characteristic tumor .</detailed_description>
