	<detailed_description>Prebiotics naturally occur carbohydrate find variety edible plant . They digest mammalian enzyme , reach gut intact , fermented specie intestinal bacteria . This fermentation think several benefit host include improve immune response . Inulin-type fructans ( oligofructose inulin ) classify prebiotics . Inulin find naturally significant amount variety plant food , banana , leek , onion , artichoke , wheat chicory . Synergy1 prebiotic preparation produce Beneo-Orafti , contain mixture oligofructose inulin derive chicory . Fructooligosaccharides include Synergy1 widely use food industry commonly find source insoluble fibre many biscuit , bakery , cereal dairy product . There increase evidence change intestinal microflora occur consumption fructooligosaccharides modulate immune parameter , gut-associated lymphoid tissue , also secondary lymphoid tissue peripheral circulation . Much evidence beneficial effect fructooligosaccharides immune function come animal model e.g . rat , mouse , dog pig . Results study show innate adaptive immune system gut associate lymphoid tissue systemic immune system modify fructooligosaccharides . However , human study far investigated effect prebiotics immune function , study mostly rely systemic marker immunity . The result show little effect fructooligosaccharides innate immune function , mixed result report regard adaptive immune system , suggest may improvement aspect immunity increase intake fructooligosaccharides . The small number publish human study lead Watzl et al . ( 2005 ) suggest human study need find whether inulin and/or oligofructose potential modulate systemic immunity well-nourished individual . There numerous method available assess human immune response . These evaluated panel European expert ( Albers et al . 2005 ) . Based biological relevance , sensitivity practical feasibility , response vaccination identify panel gold standard measure function immune system vivo ( Albers et al . 2005 ) . A small number study study effect fructooligosaccharides human immune response use vaccination response outcome , four examine fructooligosaccharides absence additional nutrient two study infant . Thus , number study examine immunologic impact fructooligosaccharides adult human use gold standard outcome limit . From public health perspective , would importance , fructooligosaccharides improve immune function especially old adult risk age-related immune decline . Thus , propose use commercially available influenza vaccine ( ImuvacÂ® ) stimulate immune response healthy human adult , use ass effect well define prebiotic preparation commonly use food industry ( Synergy1 ) .</detailed_description>
