	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Measuring blood level tumor cell patient breast cancer may help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This laboratory study look blood level tumor cell predict response patient receive first-line chemotherapy stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Levels Tumor Cells Predicting Response Patients Receiving First-Line Chemotherapy Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Predict overall progression-free survival patient stage IV breast cancer measure rate circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) second course chemotherapy . Secondary - Predict overall progression-free survival patient measure rate CTC start chemotherapy , first tumor evaluation , 2-3 course chemotherapy . - Correlate detection CTC tumor marker , clinical response , radiological response . - Study change status HER-2 CTC patient receive trastuzmab ( Herceptin® ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Blood sample collect baseline , second course chemotherapy , third fourth course chemotherapy , progressive disease diagnose ( second-line treatment initiate ) . Circulating tumor cell blood sample examine immunofluorescence . Patients follow periodically 3 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Diagnosis stage IV breast cancer Measurable evaluable disease Scheduled receive firstline chemotherapy without trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) , depend HER2 status Histologic block available confirm pathologic diagnosis measure HER2 status via FISH PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Life expectancy &gt; 3 month No cancer past 5 year except basal cell skin cancer epithelial situ cancer cervix No geographic , social , psychiatric reason would make treatment impossible PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : No prior chemotherapy metastatic disease</criteria>
