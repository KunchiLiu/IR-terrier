	<brief_summary>This research proposal two main objective . The first increase understand underlying physiological interaction occur cardiovascular , pulmonary , ANS transition positive pressure mechanical ventilation ( MV ) spontaneous breathing . The second determine heart rate variability , ( HRV ) reflection autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) activity , autonomic information flow ( AIF ) , set nonlinear measure derive HRV , measure intensive care unit ( ICU ) predict patient outcome include successful wean in-hospital recovery time episode cardiopulmonary compromise require MV . Hypothesis 1 . Transitions mechanically support ventilation spontaneous breathe disturb cardiovascular synchrony , alter relationship HRV , AIF , respiratory rate , blood pressure ; Hypothesis 2 . More normal HRV AIF value , measure baseline MV sedation awaken ( period immediately prior SBT sedative medication discontinue ) associate easy weaning , shorter intensive care unit ( ICU ) hospital lengths stay ; abnormal measurement associate long lengths stay ; Hypothesis 3 . AIF sensitive predictor successful wean MV HRV .</brief_summary>
