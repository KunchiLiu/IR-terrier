	<brief_summary>This study validate model test new vaccine design protect intestinal infection enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) . ETEC one common cause diarrhea develop country common cause traveler diarrhea . Vaccines develop development facilitate valid model test vaccine human volunteer . We anticipate new vaccine give volunteer give dose virulent ETEC bacteria . If vaccine effective , volunteer development diarrhea , vaccine effective , volunteer diarrhea day . During study , validate minimum dose virulent ETEC bacteria sufficient cause diarrhea healthy adult volunteer identify condition make model reliable . We also determine , follow-up group volunteer , expose ETEC bacteria previously protect subsequent illness expose bacteria second time . We believe previously expose group protect study immune response exposures help design vaccine accomplish kind protection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-dose Challenge Model With Enterotoxigenic E Coli</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study healthy adult inpatient volunteer challenge Escherichia coli , strain H10407 use different condition . The study follow objective . 1 . To identify revise set procedure ETEC H10407 challenge model allow inoculum dose &lt; 108 organism , cause diarrhea 50 % subject without cause high output diarrhea , determine stool output volume sign symptom associate hypovolemia . 2 . To measure mucosal systemic immune response ETEC H10407 naïve immune subject . 3 . To determine extent recent enteric illness due ETEC H10407will protect subject diarrhea re-challenged H10407 . 4 . To determine extent mucosal and/or systemic antibody response follow ETEC H10407diarrhea predictive protection re-challenge study . The study divide 4 cohort . The first cohort test four condition dose buffer challenge . Using condition appear best , large number volunteer give challenge validate condition . The third group divide volunteer ill previous study expose . Specimens obtain determine extent excretion challenge strain immune response challenge . These include measure systemic local intestinal immunity . Update May 2010 : The clinical portion study complete long recruiting . The overall result present two meeting include Vaccines Enteric Diseases Spain 2009 US-Japan Medical Science conference Cholera Enteric Disease San Diego 2009 . Volunteers receive low dose ( 7 log ) , along overnight fast develop diarrhea attack rate &gt; 75 % . Volunteers challenge second time dose protect subsequent illness . Immunological assessment volunteer continue . Update November 2011 Results first three cohort publish 2011 ( see citation ) . A fourth cohort plan enrolled evaluate virulence even low dose 5 6 log E coli . The procedure carry early cohort . Update April 2013 Following challenge 5 6 log strain H10407 , attack rate low ( approximately 30 % ) . Among volunteer develop illness , severity high dos . completion lower dose completes dose response curve H10407 . For future challenge study , 7 log H10407 bicarbonate buffer use .</detailed_description>
