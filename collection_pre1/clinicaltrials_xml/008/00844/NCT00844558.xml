	<brief_title>Mobility Optimization Through Velocity Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term objective research reduce disablement old adult knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . This accomplish assess change functional limitation ( stand walk ) occur 2 mobility-specific intervention . The principle specificity training indicate exercise closely approximate goal functional activity effective improve physical performance activity . However , uncertainty whether intervene increase muscle power improve gait mechanic would effective optimize mobility old adult knee OA . Although gait training may specific improve gait , approach currently require supervised physical therapy expensive equipment . In contrast , power training may less costly convenient conduct home . To optimize mobility old adult symptomatic knee OA , need study mobility-specific intervention randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Successful completion trial inform rehabilitation maintain improve mobility well explore mechanism effect . Specific Aim 1 : Assess efficacy two innovative intervention improve mobility limitation , disability quality life old adult symptomatic knee OA . Primary Hypothesis : For old adult symptomatic knee OA , comparison usual care ( control group ) , 3-month ) patient-specific gait training intervention b ) mobility-specific power training intervention reduce low limb mobility limitation assess use Function component Late Life Function Disability Index ( LLFDI-Function ) . Hypothesis 2 : Improved mobility maintain 6 12-month follow-up ( 3 9 month follow transition home-based training ) 2 intervention group receive combination home-based intervention encouragement continue participation . Hypothesis 3 : In comparison baseline measure , 3 , 6 , 12-month follow-up , 2 intervention group demonstrate improvement ) disability ( LDCW ) , b ) quality life assess use Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaire Quality Life component ( KOOS Knee QOL ) , c ) knee OA specific outcome score use pain subscale component KOOS .</detailed_description>
