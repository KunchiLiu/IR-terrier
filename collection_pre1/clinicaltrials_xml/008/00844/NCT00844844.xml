	<criteria>1 . Male female patient 12 18 year weigh ≥ 40 kg diagnose Atypical HemolyticUremic Syndrome ( aHUS ) . 2 . Decrease platelet count despite least 4 plasma therapy ( PT ) treatment 1 week immediately prior screening . 1 . Screening platelet count , &lt; 150 x10^9/L least 25 % low average remission platelet count 2 . If remission count available , platelet count onset current aHUS episode must ≤75x10^9/L platelet count screen must ≤ 100 x 10^9/L despite PT treatment administration least 4 PT treatment 1 week immediately prior screen 3 . Known complement regulatory protein genetic abnormality 4 . Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) level ≥ ULN unless patient receive plasma exchange LDH onset current aHUS episode least ULN . If LDH normal screening , marker indicative ongoing hemolysis haptoglobin , schistocytes evaluate discuss Sponsor 5 . Creatinine level ≥ ULN age 6 . Female patient childbearing potential must practice effective , reliable medically approve contraceptive regimen entire duration study , include followup period 5 month follow eculizumab treatment discontinuation . 7 . Patient 's parents/legal guardian must willing able give write informed consent patient must willing give write informed assent . 8 . Able willing comply study procedure . 1 . TTP , ( defined ADAMTS13 activity &lt; 5 % ) historical observation ( prior initiation plasma therapy ) test screen visit central laboratory 2 . Malignancy within 5 year screen . 3 . Typical HUS ( Shiga toxin + ) . 4 . Known HIV infection . 5 . Identified drug exposurerelated HUS . 6 . Infectionrelated HUS . 7 . HUS relate bone marrow transplant 8 . HUS related vitamin B12 deficiency 9 . Renal function status require chronic dialysis 10 . Patients confirm diagnosis sepsis 11 . Presence suspicion active untreated systemic bacterial infection , opinion Investigator confound accurate diagnosis aHUS impedes ability manage aHUS disease . 12 . Pregnancy lactation . 13 . Unresolved meningococcal disease . 14 . Known Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) antiphospholipid antibody positivity syndrome . 15 . Any medical psychological condition , opinion investigator , could increase patient 's risk participate study confound outcome study . 16 . Patients receive previous treatment eculizumab 17 . Patients receive IVIG within 8 week Rituximab therapy within 12 week screen . 18 . Patients receive immunosuppressive therapy steroid , mTOR inhibitor tacrolimus exclude unless : [ 1 ] part establish posttransplant antirejection regime , [ 2 ] patient confirm antiCFH antibody require immunosuppressive therapy , [ 3 ] dose medication unchanged least 4 week prior screen period [ 4 ] patient experience acute aHUS relapse immediately transplant 19 . Patients receive Erythrocyte Stimulating Agents ( ESAs ) unless already stable dose least 4 week prior screen period washout period least 2 week last dose ESA therapy . 20 . Participation investigational drug trial exposure investigational agent , device , procedures begin 4 week prior screen throughout entire trial . 21 .
