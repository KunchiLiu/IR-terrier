If statistically significant result obtain DPNP patient MDD , evaluation perform DPNP patient without MDD another confirmatory analysis . As secondary objective study compare two group ( MDD+/MDD- ) regard efficacy duloxetine BPI severity scale , distribution different percentage pain reduction among patient population , patient physicians impression severity improvement pain .
