	<detailed_description>Despite clear vulnerability demonstrate need , preschool child family subject little research traumatic stress follow type injury include burn ( Stoddard &amp; Saxe , 2001 ) . This lack research even critical age tragic traumatic event increase frequency severity . Early identification young burn survivor also elevate heart rate , high level pain and/or exhibit symptom PTSD may help prevent development later psychopathology . If assessment stress improve , early intervention may design prevent reduce late emergence PTSD include phobia associate symptom . As time , however , early intervention available young burn child . The intervention drive finding previous study 1-4 year old suggest child 's PTSD symptom could reduce improved pain anxiety control reduce parental PTSD . The current study aim advance science prevention pathological stress response preschool child parent , strengthen child parent resilience burn trauma treatment , provide intervention child posttraumatic symptom re-experiencing , hyperarousal , avoidance , insomnia , nightmare , regression social ability like smile and/or vocalization .

It focus increase : 1 ) parent ' knowledge understanding range behavior emotion young child typically display hospitalization 2 ) direct parent participation child 's ' emotional physical care . In collaboration COPE 's senior author , B. M. Melnyk , COPE intervention material tailor population young burn child Shriners Hospitals Children-Boston . Melnyk colleague ( 2004 ; 1997 ; 2006 ) develop COPE `` theory-based educational-behavioral program consist two type educational information : ( ) child behavioral information teach parent typical emotion behavioral response young child manifest cope illness trauma hospitalization , ( b ) parental role information provide parent suggestion regard best help child cope hospital experience '' ( Melnyk , Feinstein , Alpert-Gillis et al. , 2006 , p. 475 ) .

Each version COPE program essentially self-administered parent via audio tape activity workbooks , generally three brief ( 15 minute ) session two day period pediatric hospitalization . Examples workbook activity teach child express feeling play child read Jenny 's Wish book ( i.e. , story small child cope successfully critical care hospitalization ) . The suggested administration time : 6-16 hour admission PICU , 2-16 hour transfer general pediatric unit , 2-3 day discharge hospital . Multiple study show validity COPE ( Melnyk , 1994 , 1995 ; Melnyk et al. , 2004 ; Melnyk et al. , 2001 ; Melnyk et al. , 1997 ; Melnyk , Feinstein , &amp; Fairbanks , 2006 ; Melnyk &amp; Feinstein , 2001 ; Melnyk , Feinstein , Alpert-Gillis et al. , 2006 ; Vulcan &amp; Nikulich-Barrett , 1988 ) .
