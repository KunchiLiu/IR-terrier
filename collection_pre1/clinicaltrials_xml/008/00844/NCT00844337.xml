	<brief_summary>The primary aim establish non-inferiority several simplify , home-based antibiotic regimen compare standard course parenteral antibiotic empiric treatment suspect sepsis Bangladeshi young infant whose parent refuse hospitalization . Three alternative regimen compare standard ( reference ) regimen injectable procaine-benzyl penicillin gentamicin daily seven day . Alternative regimen ( 1 ) injectable gentamicin daily oral amoxicillin twice daily seven day ; ( 2 ) injectable penicillin gentamicin daily two day follow oral amoxicillin twice daily five day ; ( 3 ) injectable gentamicin daily oral amoxicillin twice daily two day follow oral amoxicillin twice daily five day . Hypothesis The proportion fail treatment 10 percent reference group alternative treatment group . An alternative therapy consider non-inferior standard therapy failure rate alternative therapy exceed failure rate injectable therapy le 5 absolute percentage point . Secondary Objectives : - To identify baseline clinical predictor treatment failure severe infection young infant . - To determine proportion relapse ( young infant consider cure day 7 develop sign suspect severe infection day 14 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although many develop country witness decline post-neonatal 1-4 year-old child death , neonatal death rate remain relatively constant , estimate 4 million annual neonatal death globally ( Lawn et al , 2005 ) . Almost neonatal death ( 99 % ) occur develop country ( Bryce et al. , 2005 ; Ahmad et al. , 2007 ) . In many setting , rate home delivery high attendance birth skilled personnel low , lead many baby bear unhygienic condition ( Bhutta et al. , 2005 ) . Birth setting accompany high rate infection mother newborn . It estimate 1 5 neonate develop life threaten infection ( Stoll , 1997 ) . Several preventative intervention neonatal infection include tetanus toxoid immunization pregnant woman , early exclusive breastfeeding , use clean delivery kit identify incorporated many program ( Bhutta et al. , 2005 ) . Yet , neonatal infection remain important cause neonatal death . Globally , estimate one-third neonatal death attribute infection ( Lawn 2005 ) . In setting characterize high neonatal mortality rate , proportion neonatal death due infection estimate approximately 50 % ( Bang 1999 ; Lawn 2005 ; Baqui 2006 ) . These infectious death include sepsis , pneumonia , tetanus , meningitis diarrhea . A 27 % neonatal death relate premature birth infection direct cause many premature neonate . Therefore , strategy timely identification management infection young infant ( 0-59 day ) include neonate urgently need . Current Treatment Options : Hospital care The WHO recommend case suspect severe infection young infant ( 0-59 day old ) treat hospital 7-10 day course injectable antibiotic - penicillin ( ampicillin ) gentamicin . However , many develop country , care often available accessible , acceptable family . Furthermore , low-resource setting , reliance strategy hospitalization young infant suspect severe infection number inherent disadvantage . First , many setting , vast majority young infant refer may able get hospital ( Peterson et al. , 2004 ) may receive treatment , increase risk die . Second , routine hospitalization use injectable antibiotic , either intravenously intramuscularly substantially increase cost health care ( Al-Eidan et al. , 1999 ) often hospital bed available admit young infant suspect serious infection . Third , hospitalization increase risk exposure multi-drug resistant nosocomial pathogen increasingly difficult treat ( Jarvis WR , 2004 ; Pong et al. , 2004 ) . Evidence alternative approach : Strategies community-based management infection young infant develop evaluated several research setting ( Bang et al. , 1999 ; Baqui et al. , 2007 ; Kanal et al. , 2007 ) . Our group , know Projahnmo , recently complete trial package maternal neonatal intervention Sylhet district , Bangladesh , demonstrate significant reduction neonatal mortality ( Baqui et al. , 2008b ) . In one intervention arm , train village-based community health worker assess newborns manage newborn severe infection use algorithm similar one use Integrated Management Childhood Neonatal Illness ( IMNCI ) . Management include referral neonate sign severe infection qualify provider home treatment referral failure case . If referral fail parent consent home treatment , CHWs treat neonate severe infection use injectable procaine penicillin gentamicin . For severe infection , rate referral compliance 34 % , home treatment acceptance 43 % . The case fatality rate 4.4 % treated CHWs , 14.2 % treat qualified medical provider , 28.5 % either receive treatment treat untrained provider . After control difference background characteristic illness sign among treatment group , newborn treat CHWs hazard ratio 0.22 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.07-0.71 ) death neonatal period treat qualified provider hazard ratio 0.60 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.37-0.99 ) , compare newborn receive treatment treat untrained provider ( Baqui et al. , 2007 ; Baqui et al. , 2008a ) . These data suggest treatment neonate CHWs generally acceptable community . Home treatment suspect sepsis neonate CHWs effective low-resource setting . There , however , major challenge associate current community-based strategy injectable therapy . First , difficult ensure availability train health worker able safely optimally administer injectable antibiotic daily 7 10 day , ensure supply quality assurance . Second , 7 10-day regimen parenteral antibiotic therapy present specific challenge community acceptance compliance . Third , unsupervised use injection community level may unsafe increase risk transmission HIV , hepatitis viral disease use contaminate needle ( Simonsen et al. , 1999 ) . Therefore , important reduce number injection use community . Furthermore , rationale 7-10 day parenteral antibiotic therapy fully establish . Injectable therapy choose perception efficacious regimen treatment severe disease . For neonatal infection , however , alternative regime combination parenteral oral therapy switch oral antibiotic initial treatment 2-3 day injectable antibiotic may equally effective . To overcome disadvantage hospitalization challenge community-based injectable therapy , recent research look potential use oral treatment severe pneumonia old infant . Hazir et al ( 2008 ) recently report result open-label equivalency trial conduct seven study site Pakistan . 2,037 child age 3-59 month severe pneumonia randomly allocate either initial hospitalization parenteral ampicillin ( 100 mg/kg per day four dos ) 48 h , follow 3 day oral amoxicillin ( 80-90 mg/kg per day two dos ; n=1012 ) home-based treatment 5 day oral amoxicillin ( 80-90 mg/kg per day two dos ; n=1025 ) . Follow-up assessment do day 1 , 3 , 6 , 14 enrolment . There difference treatment failure rate ( clinical deterioration ) day 7 hospitalize ( 8.6 % ) ambulatory group ( 7.5 % ; risk difference 1•1 % ; 95 % CI -1•3 3•5 ) . This result suggest empower first-level health worker manage severely ill child referral difficult . High failure rate associate young age , fast breathing , low weight age . These finding suggest may safe treat young infant suspect severe infection oral antibiotic alone . Global research priority : Simplified antibiotic regimen infection young infant In fall 2007 , Saving Newborn Lives ( SNL ) Save Children-US , USAID WHO convene global consultation review new study finding infection management young infant community-based setting guide future research priority . Based exist research finding time , consultation participant conclude still insufficient evidence make policy recommendation global program . The consultation charge future research test optimal combination oral intramuscular ( IM ) antibiotic regimen would feasible implement first-level facility community acceptable family setting characterize weak health system . We design study recommendation mind .</detailed_description>
