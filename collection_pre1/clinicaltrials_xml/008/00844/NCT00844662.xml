	<brief_summary>Magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate phosphate binder absorbs phosphate food , reduce amount body absorb . The purpose study assess efficacy magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate subject require haemodialysis , compare marketed phosphate binder , sevelamer hydrochloride .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Study Investigate Safety Efficacy Fermagate Sevelamer Hydrochloride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High level phosphate blood link serious effect , due calcium imbalance ( high level parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , bone disease , formation calcium deposit body blood-vessel disease . Current guideline indicate blood phosphorous level maintain 1.13 1.78mmol/L patient receive haemodialysis . The purpose study establish non-inferiority magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate sevelamer hydrochloride lower serum phosphate haemodialysis patient treat 3 month . Additional objective : ( 1 ) determine safety magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate short term ( 3 month ) long term ( 6 12 month ) treatment , ( 2 ) determine efficacy magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate long term treatment ( 6 12 month ) ( 3 ) To compare effect magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate sevelamer hydrochloride measure mineral metabolism , albumin , pre-albumin iron status short term ( 3 month ) long term ( 6 12 month ) treatment .</detailed_description>
