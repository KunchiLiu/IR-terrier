	<detailed_description>Analysis indicate method improve reach without trunk use Reaching performance scale ( RPS ) , trunk -stabilized group lead significant change . Training less restrictive condition associate Task-Related Training ( TRT ) ( auditory feedback trunk sensor ) compare stabilized TRT , lead improved functional impairment measure score ( WMFT , FM shoulder flexion ) . Conclusion : Fading feedback training method , extend TRT reaching/grasping practice generally lead improvement . However , demonstrate impairment functional outcome measure , use TRT auditory feedback signal effective approach force stabilization trunk rehabilitation upper-limb .</detailed_description>
