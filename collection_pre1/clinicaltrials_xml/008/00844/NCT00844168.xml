	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Liver Cancer Who Have Undergone Liver Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish safety toxicity profile sorafenib administer daily hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patient undergone orthotopic liver transplantation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine explant allograft expression vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , microvessel density ( CD34 ) Ki67 ( proliferation marker ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
