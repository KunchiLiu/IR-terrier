	<brief_summary>For majority patient , metastatic HCC incurable patient consider candidate clinical trial appropriate . Till recently worldwide , approve local systemic therapy advance HCC available therapy advance unresectable and/or metastatic HCC limit clinical value , low response rate little impact natural history disease . Furthermore , toxicity associate agent severe , require careful patient selection , dramatically decrease number patient may benefit therapy . The SHARP trial establish survival benefit Sorafenib Advanced HCC result yet remain humble . The need effective therapy still . Study Objectives The primary objective phase II study evaluate efficacy safety Sorafenib Gemcitabine combination patient advance HCC . Safety data limit efficacy data collect combination study . All Drug-Related Adverse Events , Adverse Events NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 Grade 3 high , Serious Adverse Events regardless causal relationship study drug record study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Sorafenib Gemcitabine Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over-all Study Design This non-randomized , open-label treatment protocol patient advance HCC . 30 Patients treat 400 mg oral sorafenib twice day continuous basis Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 administer day 1 &amp; 8 4 week cycle . Patients protocol may continue treat combination minimum 4 cycle follow criterion protocol discontinuation reach : 1 . Progression disease . 2 . The patient unlikely benefit treatment Judged Investigator . 3 . Intolerable toxicity drug . 4 . Withdrawal consent reason . Dosage , administration duration Doses study drug may delay reduce case clinically significant toxicity possibly , probably definitely relate protocol therapy . Toxicities grade use NCI Common Terminology Criteria Version 3.0 ( see Appendix 10.6 ) . If patient experience several toxicity conflict recommendation , recommend dose adjustment reduces dose low level use . All dose modification follow pre-defined dose level indicate study drug , respectively . The dose modification sorafenib follow follow dose level : Dose level 1 ( start dose ) : 400 mg ( 2 x 200 mg ) p. o. twice daily Dose level 2 : 400 mg ( 2 x 200 mg ) p. o. daily Dose level 3 : 400 mg ( 2 x 200 mg ) p. o. every day If dose reduction two dose level 400 mg twice daily schedule require , patient discontinue study treatment . Also , discretion Investigator , dose may escalate high dose level maximum 400 mg twice daily follow resolution Adverse Event improvement Adverse Event level permit re-escalation study drug . For Gemcitabine potentially dose limit toxicity myelosuppression , dose delay allow Grade 3 4 toxicity . Growth factor administer unless delay 2 week recovery hematological toxicity .</detailed_description>
