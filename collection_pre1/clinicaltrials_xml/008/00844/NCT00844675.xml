	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To examine oral administration Pariet ( proton pump inhibitor , 20mg tablet , twice daily 5 day ) Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) exhibit preventive effect ulcer bleed compare placebo group ( preoperative administration placebo ) - To evaluate effect suppression acid secretion preoperative administration Proton pump inhibitor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Oral Rabeprazole Prevention Ulcer Bleeding Following Endoscopic Mucosal Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) less invasive surgery know general treatment early gastric cancer gastric adenoma patient ' quality life take consideration . However , major complication bleed perforation remain problematic.1-5 The incidence complication expect rise size lesion EMR indicate enlarge . Histamine 2 receptor antagonist ( H2RA ) proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) use bleeding,1-3 bleeding rate follow EMR report still high 1.4 % 24 % .1,4 Green et al Berstad et al cite research intragastric PH sustain 5.4 prevent bleeding , PPIs administer instead H2RAs keep PH 5.4 . Being studied administration modality enhance therapeutic efficacy PPIs H2RAs.1-3 Several study already demonstrate high-dose PPI therapy , PPI administer twice daily , effectively block acid secretion increase intragastric pH neutral.3 Our study team also suggest previous study high-dose PPI therapy adequate maintain intragastric pH 6 . - PPIs know induce suppression acid secretion destroy proton pump , yet take 5 day achieve maximum effects.7,8 It 's suggest onset PPIs slow prevent bleed administration PPI EMR.4 Therefore , investigator expect 5-day administration oral PPI EMR would increase intragastric pH 6 would least equal superior intravenous PPIs currently use term suppression acid secretion . - This prospective , randomize , comparative study substantiate oral administration rabeprazole ( Pariet tablet ) 20mg twice daily EMR ( PO RBP group ) show similar effect prevention bleeding compare conventional treatment iv administration pantoprazole EMR special medication give EMR ( Placebo group ) . In addition , go measure intragastric pH among part study subject evaluate effect acid suppression PO RBP group superior placebo group .</detailed_description>
