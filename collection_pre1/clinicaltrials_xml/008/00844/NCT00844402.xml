	<brief_summary>Primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) frequently associate hypercholesterolemia possibly increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Statins low serum cholesterol level may thus improve cardiovascular risk PBC patient . The aim study therefore prospectively examine efficacy low-dose atorvastatin indicator cardiovascular risk dyslipidemia vascular function well safety patient PBC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) often associate abnormality serum lipid . Hypercholesterolemia establish risk factor cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Since many PBC patient slow progression underlie liver disease cardiovascular risk factor may become relevant prognostic facors . Whether statins low serum cholesterol level reduce cardiovascular risk PBC patient remain determined . Statins generally well tolerate associate increase risk hepatotoxicity patient nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . However limited data safety statins chronic cholestatic liver diseases available . In recent pilot study Medical University Graz atorvastatin statistically increase liver enzymes PBC patient . However , data long-term treatment atorvastatin patient yet available . Moreover , long-term treatment statin may potential beneficial immunomodulatory effect disease course PBC analogy immune-mediated disorder rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis .</detailed_description>
