	<brief_summary>This protocol part large grant fund NCI create international research center study traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) . All patient enrol study treat Cancer Hospital , Fudan University , sister institution Shanghai , China . No patient see MDACC . This protocol overseen Fudan University Institutional Review Board ( IRB00002408 ) Federal Wide Assurance U.S. Department Health &amp; Human Services ( Approved : April 25 , 2002 ) . The research nurse receive train MDACC receive regular oversight MDACC personnel . Primary End Point : 1 . Determine efficacy huachansu measure progression free survival 4 month . Secondary End Points : 1 . Examine feasibility safety treatment use huachansu combination gemcitabine patient pancreatic cancer . 2 . Determine clinical efficacy measure include tumor response , 6-month survival , change quality life ( QOL ) patient pancreatic cancer . 3 . Monitor patient blood level three main cardiac glycoside huachansu ( bufalin , cinobufagin , resibufogenin ) . This information provide evidence delineate role cardiac glycoside antitumor activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Huachansu &amp; Gemcitabine Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : HuaChanSu substance use China treat different type cancer . One major element substance bufalin , ingredient show block growth tumor cell . Gemcitabine design disrupt growth cancer cell , may cause cancer cell die . Screening : Before receive study treatment , `` screening test . '' These test help study doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test perform : - You ask question medical history symptom may . - You complete physical exam . - Your vital sign ( temperature , heart rate , breathe rate , blood pressure ) , height , weight measure . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . - You electrocardiogram ( ECG-a test measure electrical activity heart ) . - To check status cancer , compute tomography ( CT ) scan ( ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan abdomen , pelvis , area disease . - You complete short questionnaire ask question quality life . This take 5 minute complete . - A traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis also do . This include diagnosis study doctor . The doctor take pulse ( heart rate ) , look tongue , ask question health . The doctor also use heart-rate machine take photograph tongue . This allow scientific check heart rate tongue condition . - You blood ( 3 teaspoon ) collect routine safety test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able child . To eligible take part study , pregnancy test must negative . - You 1 biopsy tumor tissue check cancer type . To collect tumor tissue biopsy , area cancer locate numbed anesthetic , small amount tumor tissue withdrawn large needle . Randomization : If find eligible decide take part study , may begin treatment . The first 3 participant enrol study give HuaChanSu gemcitabine , find dose combination tolerate . After first 3 participant enrol , participant randomly assign ( toss coin ) receive HuaChanSu gemcitabine gemcitabine placebo . The first 20 participant equal chance receive HuaChanSu placebo , point , participant well chance assign group respond good study combination . All participant receive dose level gemcitabine , know give HuaChanSu placebo . However , information find medically necessary . Study Treatment : Before study drug infusion begin , fit peripherally-inserted central catheter ( PICC ) specially trained nurse . A PICC tube insert vein , either arm collarbone , make easy give gemcitabine without HuaChanSu . This outpatient procedure . You give separate consent form insertion PICC . It explain risks procedure take care PICC . Your dos gemcitabine either HuaChanSu placebo ( saline [ salt water ] solution look like HuaChanSu effect ) give PICC study . - HuaChanSu ( placebo ) give 2-hour continuous ( nonstop ) infusion PICC . You receive 2-hour dose 5 day week ( 5 day row time ) 3 week . This follow 1 week receive drug . - Gemcitabine give needle vein 30 minute Days 1 , 8 , 15 , follow 1 week study drug give . Each 4-week treatment period call study `` cycle . '' PK Testing : During Cycle 1 , extra blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) collect various time point pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . PK blood sample draw 4 time 24-hour period Day 1 Days 7 , 14 , 21 . Study Tests : Before new cycle , ask question current health , complete physical exam . Your vital sign weight measure . You performance status evaluation . You complete questionnaire quality life . The questionnaire take 5 minute complete . You also blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine safety test . On Days 8 15 cycle , also blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine safety test . Every 8 week ( start Cycle 3 ) , check status cancer , CT and/or MRI scan ( ) abdomen , pelvis , area disease . Length Study Participation : You may continue receive cycle treatment , long cancer get worse intolerable side effect occur . You take study cancer get bad , intolerable side effect occur , new information show treatment right , able follow study rule , study stop , decide leave study reason . If think leave study , please tell study doctor , may tell end treatment safely well treatment option available . End-of-Treatment Visit : You ask final study visit 4 week last dose study drug . During visit , follow test procedure perform : - You blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine safety test . - You ask question medical history . - You complete physical exam , vital sign weight measure . - You performance status evaluation . - You complete questionnaire quality life . - To check status cancer , compute tomography ( CT ) scan ( ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan abdomen , pelvis , area disease ( perform close time stop study treatment ) . This investigational study . HuaChanSu commercially available medication approve Chinese FDA treatment pancreatic cancer . Gemcitabine approve Chinese FDA treatment pancreatic cancer . In study , combination drug use research . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol Fudan University Cancer Hospital .</detailed_description>
