	<brief_summary>Background : - Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) associate complication major contributor global disease burden . T2D already major health threat population develop country rapidly take hold developing world . - It believe understand complex interplay genetic lifestyle characteristic etiology T2D related complication lead development well preventive therapeutic strategy . In Addition , result project facilitate understanding cause diabetes African Americans , US world population Objectives : - To conduct genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) identify susceptibility genetic variant diabetes among Yoruba people Ibadan , Nigeria . - To enroll examine 300 unrelated case T2D 300 ethnicity-matched Yoruba control . - To conduct resequencing positional candidate gene/loci identify likely functional variant subset cohort . - To conduct replication study top-100 score variant three independent African European ancestry sample . - To investigate whether diabetes-associated variant discover European population increase diabetes risk West Africans . Eligibility : - Patients 25 year age confirm T2D newly diagnose treatment Yoruba ethnicity Ibadan , Nigeria . Control subject nondiabetics ethnically match patient . Design : - The study design patient control consists follow step : - Discuss informed consent process obtain sign informed consent form . Informed consent administer trained clinic staff . - Assign study ID ( barcode ) - Administer questionnaires - Obtain spot urine sample - Measure blood pressure - Obtain anthropometric measurement include body composition - Perform finger prick blood glucose level - Obtain venous blood sample - Perform eye examination - On follow day , perform confirmatory blood glucose small subset participant require confirmation previous test result DNA extraction store sample do either National Institutes Health laboratory Nigeria . - GWAS conduct use publicly available software package .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research protocol design study genetic basis Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) broad range population United States abroad . This project take advantage well establish infrastructure success Dr. Rotimi international genetic epidemiology study T2D fund R01 grant NIDDK Howard University . This parent project ongoing four major ethnic group Nigeria ( Yoruba Ibo ) Ghana ( Akan Gaa ) . At completion 2013 give current projection , anticipate enrol 2,000 case 2000 control five center West Africa ( Enugu , Ibadan Lagos Nigeria ; Accra Kumasi Ghana ) . However , current projection indicate enrollment Yoruba case control short 300 case 300 control . It critically important supplement enrollment Yoruba participants another community Ibadan metropolitan area Nigeria . Therefore , original goal current project enroll additional 300 case T2D 300 ethnically match Yoruba control facilitate conduct genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) candidate gene/loci study West Africans . Other current future project increase number subject future genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) , linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) mapping , functional study different ethnically-defined population . Each project aim enroll ethnically balanced case control goal facilitate conduct GWAS candidate gene/loci study broad range population . Overall , study aim ( case first ) large-scale effort understand genetic basis T2D individual vary background include African Mexican ancestry . Identified candidate genes/loci investigate re-sequencing functional study conduct identify susceptibility variant diabetes associated complication include obesity , hypertension , nephropathy , neuropathy retinopathy . Additionally , sample use study genetic variation context participant different ancestry respond drug environmental factor variation may shape population history . Given past activity , also anticipate resource form basis multiple collaboration Dr. Rotimi lab , several NIH intramural researcher non-NIH scientist . Each subsequent population add study time use procedure originally approve ongoing work among West Africans .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Cases Men woman confirm type 2 diabetes mellitus either treatment diabetes newly diagnose blood sugar read one occasion exceed equal 126 mg/dl . These person must age 25 year . In regard , newly diagnose participant require visit clinic follow day perform fast blood glucose test confirm previous result . Controls Men woman fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) less 100 mg/dl ( 5.6 mmol/l ) . Controls must age 25 year ethnically match case . Enrolled case control unrelated . Therefore , one person may enrol family unless husband wife . Attempts make enroll equal number men woman . To ensure ethnic distribution maintain study , propose enroll ethnicallymatched participant relevant study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : People meet criterion ( e.g. , young 24 , without blood sugar requirement , etc ) . No one nonspouse member family . No prisoner , pregnant woman fetus include study .</criteria>
