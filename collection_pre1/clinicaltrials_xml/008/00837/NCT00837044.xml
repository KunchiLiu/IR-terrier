	<brief_summary>Migraine headache occur frequently woman men associate symptom significant pain also symptoms typically include photophobia , phonophobia , nausea vomit . Many migraine patient report difficulty cognition lack concentration , difficulty word find inability remember . Many cognitive symptom seem independent pain intensity may occur completely separately headache pain disabling . It likely frequency importance cognitive symptom associate migraine underreported . The Mental Efficacy Workload Test ( MEWT ) computerize battery design efficient accurate measure cognition migraine headache . Treximet new migraine treatment recently FDA approve treatment relief acute migraine may effective cognitive symptom migraine patient history cognitive dysfunction migraine headache . The primary efficacy parameter evaluate effectiveness treatment Treximet versus placebo patient acute migraine headache measure neuropsychological function use MEWT migraine compare score prior MEWT score patient migraine symptom . A double blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study choose patient may control . It intent study determine type intensity cognitive dysfunction associate migraine headache extent Treximet may relieve cognitive dysfunction safe effective manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treximet Acute Migraine Headache : Assessing Cognitive Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Study Design : This study double blind crossover comparison study patient migraine headache attack , assessments one two hour treatment . Patients IHS diagnosis migraine without aura may include . The patient complete questionnaire regard nature migraine attack , include impression cognitive impairment . Historically associate symptom list . Menstrual associate migraine history assess . 30 patient randomize Treximet placebo 1:1 manner first treatment reverse order treatment second migraine attack . In manner , patient control . 60 migraine headache treat study . Also , previously discuss 3 practice session MEWT , administration MEWT produce bias practice effect ANAM show produce bias practice effect.10 Therefore , patient 3 practice session clinic take baseline MEWT . During baseline period , patient without migraine symptom feel well ( interictal period ) , three practice trial MEWT perform fourth MEWT trial take score recorded neuropsychological baseline . When patient experience migraine headache , patient rate headache severity associate symptom take Treximet match placebo . The patient repeat headache associate symptom checklist MEWT 1 2 hour treatment . Rescue medication allow 2 hour patient require . 4.0 Clinical Methods : 4.1 Selection Study Population : 4.2 Visit 1 ( Screen visit ) : After inform consent reviewed sign , inclusion exclusion criterion review patient approve study , patient assessment practice MEWT session list . The patient schedule visit 2 . These assessment complete follow order : 1. . Type ( ) migraine include menstrual migraine 2. . Medical surgical history 3. . Migraine history : age onset , age onset cognitive dysfunction 4. . Family history migraine 5. . Prior treatment migraine , rescue preventative 6. . Age , sex , educational background 7 . Concomitant medication 8 . General physical neurological examination 9 . Reviewing patient headache severity symptom assessment form 10 . Two practice session MEWT 4.3 Visit 2 Patient return clinic within 2 week review headache severity symptom form fill home work experience migraine . Two MEWT session take , one last session practice baseline test compare MEWT assessment experience migraine . Subject randomized treximet placebo give medication package instruction . * Subject also give MEWT device take home along assessment diary . 4.4 Visit 3 ( Post-treatment visit # 1 ) : The patient return clinic within one week treat migraine review headache severity symptom assessment form , MEWT score adverse event ( AE ) dairy . Patient give second medication package second migraine treatment . * Subject give MEWT device assessment form take home complete experience headache . 4.5 Visit 4 ( Post-treatment visit # 2 ) : The patient return clinic within one week treat second migraine review headache severity symptom assessment form , MEWT score AD dairy . * Patients may take rescue medication choice 2 hour take Treximet placebo wish . 5.0 Adverse Events An adverse event definition protocol follow : Any unexpected , untoward medical occurrence consider clinically significant investigator . All adverse event fit description capture recorded case report form . In event subject withdrawn study adverse event , must record CRF . The subject follow treated investigator abnormal parameter symptom resolve stabilize . All adverse event record Case Report Form ( CRF ) 6.0 Serious Adverse Events A serious AE mean adverse event fit description also contain one following : - Death - Life threaten experience place subject immediate risk death event occur . - Full Inpatient hospitalization prolongation hospitalization - Persistent significant disability/incapacity - Congenital anomaly birth defect Any report event conduct study immediately report sponsor , IRB Medwatch . 7.0 Statistical analysis plan , sample size justification power analysis Cognitive function efficacy analysis ( pain relief ) calculate intent-to-treat ( ITT ) population . Statistics present headache response ( 0-3 scale ) , pain-free response , safety demographic . Five subset MEWT use ( CPT , MTS , MP , PRT SRT -see Table 1 ) . Four subset test MEWT ( CPT , MTS , MP , PRT ) score 'throughput , ' number correct response per minute . This measure efficacy combine speed accuracy single score . SRT calculate reaction time msec . Group mean calculate patient 's mean MEWT subtest compare stage migraine : migraine-free , migraine pre-treatment ( time zero ) migraine post-treatment ( time 1 2 hour ) . Each MEWT subtest calculate use repeat measure 1 x 3 ( stage migraine : migraine free , pre post-treatment ) analysis variance ( ANOVA ) statistical significance least p = 0.05 better . 8.0 Duration study Nine month ( 30 patient baseline practice session , treatment 2 separate migraine headache ) 9.0 Specific drug supply requirement Treximet match placebo 10.0 Publication/presentation plan Submission national and/or international headache meeting soon data analyze . Submission peer review journal within 6 month study analysis completion . 11.0 Source Documentation Case Report Form Completion Source document define original document , data record . These may include hospital record , clinical office chart , lab result , cognitive data information , etc . The Case Report Form document serve source record trial . All form complete within 5 business day study visit . A CRF provide enrol study subject . All CRFs complete use black ink . All correction make strike single line write correct data , beside , erroneous data , obscure original entry . Each correction initial dated person make correction . 12.0 Retention Availability Records The investigator maintain adequate record protocol include sign Informed consent , patient information sheet , complete source document , CRF 's , Lab report , Medical record , AE report information regard subject discontinue . 13.0 Ethics Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) require clinical protocol , protocol amendment , Investigators Brochure applicable , informed consent/assent , form subject information relate study ( include advertisement ) review IEC/IRB . IRB approval mandatory initiate study related activity . The study conduct per protocol , accordance ICH guideline , applicable regulation , guideline govern clinical study conduct ethical principle origin Declaration Helsinki . 14.0 Use Information/Confidentiality All information obtain conduct clinical trial consider confidential . This information may disclose deemed necessary Neurological Research Center Inc GlaxoSmithKline , Inc. clinical investigator , IEC/IRB , FDA governmental agency . Patient identifier include patient assigned number , age , sex . Patient Initials release company irrelevant information . The investigator maintain confidential subject identification code list subject enrol study name subject number . This list maintain investigative site .</detailed_description>
