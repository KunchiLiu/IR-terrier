	<brief_summary>A small number woman asthma increase asthma symptom premenstrual menstrual period . This study do investigate possible cause premenstrual increase asthma symptom help asthma care provider identify patient may suffer condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inflammatory Mediators microRNA Analysis Premenstrual Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well establish woman suffer asthma symptom bad health-related quality life men level asthma severity . The etiology sex-related difference unknown , subset woman premenstrual asthma ( PMA ) worsen asthma symptom either prior menstruation . Previous small trial suggest increase host inflammatory response may correlate PMA symptom . We evidence small inhibitory ribonucleic acid , microRNAs , circulate peripheral blood human patient may express different pattern certain disease state compare healthy individual . We plan compare pattern microRNA expression well characterize group woman PMA without PMA determine alteration microRNA pattern play role increase asthma symptoms premenstrual period . In addition , plan compare level inflammatory marker population good define specific subset woman may risk premenstrual asthma . By good characterize woman , hope identify clinically relevant predictor may guide therapy woman suffer PMA . Procedures use study include questionnaire administration , pulmonary function assessment , exhale nitric oxide evaluation , urine sampling pregnancy , blood draw microRNA serum leukotriene evaluation . These technique utilize widely clinical asthma research , associate minimal risk .</detailed_description>
