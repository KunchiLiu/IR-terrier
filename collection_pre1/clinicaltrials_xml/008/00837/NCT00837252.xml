	<brief_summary>Central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) retinal disorder characterize accumulation serous fluid retina . Although acute CSC tend spontaneously resolve minimal sequela , chronic CSC tend persist lead irreversible visual loss . The pathogenesis CSC complex ; however , systemic androgen implicate . Finasteride anti-androgen medication widely use treatment various condition . The objective study investigate safety potential efficacy oral finasteride treatment chronic CSC . Five participant chronic CSC enrol uncontrolled , unmasked , Phase I/II study . An oral dose finasteride , 5 mg daily , administer participant three month . Following , finasteride withhold participant observe another three month . If participant experience beneficial effect period receive finasteride experience relapse observation period , finasteride re-instituted remain period study . Relapse define return baseline maximum lesion height and/or return baseline lesion volume .</brief_summary>
