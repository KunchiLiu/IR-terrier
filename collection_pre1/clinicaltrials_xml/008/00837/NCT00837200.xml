	<brief_summary>This exploratory study study efficacy combination regimen Oncaspar/Doxil/Decadron ( ODD ) patient refractory lymphoid malignancy . Patients form lymphoid malignancy eligible : acute lymphoblastic leukemia , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , Hodgkin 's lymphoma , multiple myeloma plasma cell leukemia . Patients must fail standard regimens cancer could unlimited number prior regimen . Patients stag appropriately disease clinical examination , laboratory test , image study . Both Oncaspar Doxil give day 1 15 . Patients clinically evaluate prior cycle disease assessment every 2 cycle . Responding patient continue therapy disease progression excessive toxicity . Responders candidate allogenic stem cell transplantation could go condition chemotherapy stem cell transplant 4 cycle ODD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase II trial study effectiveness combination regimen include Oncaspar ( PEG-asparaginase ) , Doxil ( PEG-liposomal doxorubicin ) , Decadron ( ODD ) term disease response refractory lymphoid malignancy . Asparaginase enzyme depletes asparagine , key amino acid survival growth malignant lymphocytes . Its depletion result death neoplastic cell . Asparagine depletion induce significant improvement clinical outcome acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) L-asparaginase mainstay 30 year treatment ALL . Although drug use primarily ALL , promise result report even non-ALL lymphoid malignancy , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , prolymphocytic leukemia , refractory non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) multiple myeloma ( MM ) . One main goal trial measure asparaginase level surrogate marker asparagine depletion Oncaspar , PEG-enhanced version E. coli L-asparaginase . The therapeutic value simple , non-pegylated form L-asparaginase limit short half-life propensity cause allergic reaction .</detailed_description>
