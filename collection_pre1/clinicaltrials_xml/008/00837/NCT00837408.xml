	<brief_summary>Objectives : - To conduct genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) identify susceptibility genetic variant diabetes among Han Chinese . - To conduct resequencing positional candidate gene/loci identify likely functional variant subset cohort . - To conduct replication study top-100 score variant three independent African European ancestry sample . - To investigate whether diabetes-associated variant discover European population increase diabetes risk Han Chinese . Eligibility : - Patients 25 year age newly diagnose T2D Suizhou , China . Control subject nondiabetics , age ethnically match patient . Design : - The study design patient control consists follow step : - Discuss informed consent process obtain sign informed consent form . Informed consent administer trained clinic staff . - Assign study ID ( barcode ) - Administer questionnaires - Obtain spot urine sample - Measure blood pressure - Obtain anthropometric measurement include body composition - Perform finger prick blood glucose level - Obtain venous blood sample - Perform eye examination - On follow day , perform confirmatory blood glucose small subset participant require confirmation previous test result - DNA extraction store sample do either National Institutes Health laboratory China . - GWAS conduct use publicly available software package .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research protocol design study genetic basis Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) Han Chinese . This project take place Suizhou Central Hospital complement several year similar research activity conduct Dr. Rotimi lab population African Diaspora study site Nigeria , Ghana , Kenya US . Suizhou Hospital select existence excellent team research investigator , infrastructure importantly , availability large population enroll examine person diabetes normal control . Previous funding Dr. Rotimi lab Howard University make possible Dr. Jiang staff enroll 1000 case control . Therefore , goal current project enroll additional 1500 case T2D 1500 ethnically match Han control Suizhou facilitate conduct genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) candidate gene/loci study Han , Chinese . The current project increase number subject future GWAS , linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) map functional study 4,000 ethnically balance case ( great 2,000 ) control ( great 2,000 ) . Identified candidate genes/loci investigate re-sequencing functional study conduct identify susceptibility variant diabetes associated complication include obesity , hypertension , nephropathy , neuropathy retinopathy . Given past activity , also anticipate resource form basis multiple collaboration Dr. Rotimi lab , several NIH intramural researcher non-NIH scientist .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Cases Men woman confirm type 2 diabetes mellitus either treatment diabetes newly diagnose blood sugar read one occasion exceed equal 126 mg/dl . These person must age 25 year . In regard , newly diagnose participant require visit clinic follow day perform fast blood glucose test confirm previous result . Controls Men woman fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) less 100 mg/dl ( 5.6 mmol/l ) . Controls must age 25 year ethnically match case . Enrolled case control unrelated . Therefore , one person may enrol family unless husband wife . Attempts make enroll equal number men woman . To ensure ethnic distribution maintain parent study , propose enroll Han Chinese participant . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : People meet criterion ( e.g. , young 24 , without blood sugar requirement , etc ) . No one nonspouse member family . No prisoner , pregnant woman fetus include study .</criteria>
