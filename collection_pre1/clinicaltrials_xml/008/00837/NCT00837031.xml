	<brief_title>Lenalidomide With Gemcitabine Treatment Untreated Advanced Carcinoma Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because activity lenalidomide address numerous mechanism carcinoma growth inhibition - include , limited anti-angiogenesis - lenalidomide evaluate part induction chemotherapy regimens solid tumor . This phase II study previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer design establish test appropriate lenalidomide dose regimen combination gemcitabine .</detailed_description>
