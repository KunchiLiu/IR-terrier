	<detailed_description>The development pulmonary complication hematopoietic stem cell transplantation responsible significant morbidity mortality . The incidence pulmonary disease report high 50 % patient undergo transplant . The common manifestation early onset lung disease idiopathic pneumonia syndrome . This occur autologous allogeneic transplant , incidence 5 % 10 % mortality rate high 74 % ( 1 ) . Late onset pulmonary disease may even frequent report 10-24 % recipient allogeneic HSCT ( 2-4 ) . Additionally , recent study demonstrate 26 % patient develop airflow obstruction transplant correlate mortality ( 5 ) . One quite useful classification system divide late onset pulmonary disease bronchiolitis obliterans interstitial pneumonia ( 4 ) . Interstitial pneumonia condition characterize diffuse infiltrates , often lymphocyte predominance , associate restrictive defect pulmonary function test . Bronchiolitis obliterans characterize progressive airflow obstruction normal radiograph ( except possibly associate air trap ) . The incidence bronchiolitis obliterans HSCT varies widely , usually report 1 % 11 % ( 6-8 ) , although presence post HSCT obstructive airway disease report 26 % recent large study ( 5 ) . Late onset pulmonary disease often treat increased immunosuppression , prognosis poor limited response therapy ( 9 ; 4 ) .</detailed_description>
