	<brief_title>Genetic Determinants Response Beta Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Aim define contribution genetic variation interindividual variability response β-blockade . The rationale study follow : Beta-blockers prevent activation β-ARs thus form cornerstone treatment pathological state congestive heart failure coronary artery disease . Functional polymorphisms cardiac beta-receptors show determine response β-blocker therapy . A physiologic stimulus exercise cause sympathetic stimulation activation cardiac β-ARs genotypic difference response β-blockers magnify state heighten sympathetic activity . Thus , addition measure response β-blockers rest , also determine response β-blockade sub-maximal exercise supine bicycle ergometer . Genetic variation may alter sensitivity beta blocker seek .</detailed_description>
