	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safe add multiple immunotherapy standard chemotherapy radiation treat pancreatic cancer tumor completely remove surgery . 1 . GI-4000 Vaccination : The first involve `` vaccine , '' injection ( shot ) teach immune system attack foreign invader . The vaccine use call `` GI-4000 '' - vaccine compose yeast make carry protein ( call `` mutate Ras protein '' ) find pancreatic cancer cell . 2 . Adoptive T-cell Transfer : The second type immunotherapy study call `` adoptive T-cell transfer . '' This involve collect specific type white blood cell ( call `` T-cells '' ) grow T-cells grown lab may help research participant ' immune system recover quickly chemotherapy , possibly improve response immunotherapy . We hope study agent together teach u help immune system fight pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GI-4000 With Adoptive Transfer Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/Pilot study ass safety feasibility GI-4000 series vaccine without adoptive T cell transfer subject locally advanced pancreatic cancer undergo chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgical resection . Subjects randomize either ARM A ( GI-4000vaccine ) ARM B ( GI-4000 vaccine activate T cell transfer ) . All subject undergo apheresis mononuclear cell immediately receive four cycle gemcitabine/oxaliplatin ( GemOx ) chemotherapy ( `` immune preservation phase '' ) . After completion chemotherapy , apheresis product reinfused , subject enter `` priming phase , '' two biweekly dos ( dose # 1 # 2 ) appropriate GI-4000 vaccine ( one best match mutation find patient 's tumor ) single dose Prevnar pneumococcal conjugate vaccine administer . At time , subject develop distant metastatic disease CT/MRI undergo chemoradiation , ARM B subject receive second apheresis immediately prior initiation chemoradiation . The pheresed product activate expand ex vivo reinfused chemoradiation complete . All subject receive two biweekly boost GI-4000 vaccine ( dose # 3 # 4 ) undergo restaging CT/MRI ( `` boost phase '' ) . Those developed metastatic disease undergo surgical evaluation tumor resection . Patients undergo R0 R1 resection receive three weekly dose GI-4000 prior initiation adjuvant gemcitabine , monthly dos GI-4000 four cycle gemcitabine chemotherapy , monthly GI-4000 dos thereafter . At end gemcitabine chemotherapy , apheresis perform endpoint correlative study . Those candidate surgery whose tumor completely resect continue receive GI-4000 monthly booster vaccination .</detailed_description>
