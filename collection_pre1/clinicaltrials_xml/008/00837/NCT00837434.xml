	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic disease lead inflammation progressive joint damage . RA systemic inflammatory autoimmune disorder affect almost 1 % United States population . Current therapy target immune system early disease process joint damage occurs , include drug methotrexate ( MTX ) tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -blocking agent . The primary purpose study determine effectiveness two TNF inhibitor , etanercept adalimumab , memory B lymphocytes ( B-cells ) peripheral blood participant RA . Additionally , 4 optional sub-studies part trial : - B-Cell Kinetic Sub-Study look change B-cell subset time quickly reduction B-cell memory occur - Vaccine Response Sub-Study ass B cell memory response immunization hepatitis B , -hepatitis A , diphtheria/tetanus vaccine , determine whether T-cell vaccine response alter TNF blockade - Tonsil Biopsy Sub-Study evaluate TNF blockade affect memory B-cells tonsil dendritic cell germinal cell - Synovial Biopsy Sub-Study evaluate TNF blockade affect change memory B-cells lymphoid tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RA characterize persistent inflammation peripheral joint , cause pain , stiffness , swell warmth . Over past 10 year , advancement biotechnology revolutionize RA therapeutic biologically-derived immunomodulating compound . TNF-alpha inhibitor constitute large class new biologic therapy . The purpose study determine effectiveness two TNF inhibitor , etanercept adalimumab , memory B lymphocytes ( B-cells ) peripheral blood participant RA . This study last 24 week . Participants randomize one two treatment group . Participants one group receive dose etanercept every week 24 week . Participants group receive dose adalimumab every 2 week 24 week . This study consist seven study visit randomization occur study entry Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 24 . Blood collection occur study visit . A write participant assessment , vital sign , physical exam occur study entry Weeks 12 24 . Follow-up call assess safety schedule Weeks 4 , 8 , 16 , 20 . Additionally , participant offer opportunity enter one four sub-studies mention brief summary : B Cell Kinetic Sub-Study , Vaccine Response Sub-Study , Tonsil Biopsy Sub-Study , Synovial Biopsy Sub-Study . More information sub-studies protocol .</detailed_description>
