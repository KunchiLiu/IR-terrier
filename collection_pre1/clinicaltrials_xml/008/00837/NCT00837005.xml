	<brief_summary>High-dose dobutamine/atropine stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( DS-MRI ) incorporate daily clinical practice detection ischemic heart disease . Thus , wall motion abnormality ( WMA ) stress , precede development ST-segment depression ECG anginal symptom aid detection anatomically significant coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . DS-MRI offer possibility integrate myocardial perfusion wall motion analysis single examination . In regard , recent data suggest assessment myocardial wall motion perfusion single session may enhance sensitivity technique diagnosis CAD . However , date limit data available prognostic value high-dose DS-MRI large patient cohort , treat accord current guideline . Assessment long-term outcome DS-MRI important test may identify high-risk patient , would benefit invasive diagnostic therapy , lower-risk patient additional procedure intensive medical follow-up require . In present study aim determine value wall motion perfusion assessment high-dose dobutamine/atropine MRI predict cardiac event . In addition , incremental value MR-stress test result assess ( inducible wall motion , perfusion abnormality combination ) consideration traditional clinical risk factor baseline ejection fraction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : High-dose dobutamine stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( DS-MRI ) incorporate daily clinical practice detection coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Purpose : To determine value wall motion perfusion assessment DS-MRI prediction cardiac event large patient cohort . Methods : Cardiovascular MR-Examination . Patients examine clinical 1.5-T whole-body MR-scanner Achieva system ( Philips Medical Systems , Best , The Netherlands ) use 5-element cardiac phased-array receiver coil . Cardiovascular MR-images acquire rest standardize high-dose dobutamine/atropine protocol involve short breath hold , use vector electrocardiogram R-wave triggering11 . Electrocardiographic rhythm symptom monitor continuously , blood pressure measure every 3 minute . Follow-up Data . Personnel unaware stress test result contact subject immediate family member date contact use calculate follow-up time duration . Outcome data iscollected standardized questionnaire determine patient interview outpatient clinic telephone interview . Reported clinical event confirm review correspond medical record electronic Hospital Information System ( HIS ) , contact general practitioner , refer cardiologist treat hospital . Cardiac death nonfatal myocardial infarction register major cardiac event . Cardiac death define death cardiac cause ( lethal arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure ) sudden unexpected death occur without another explanation . Myocardial infarction define angina &gt; 30 minute duration either ST segment elevation ≥2mm 2 consecutive ECG lead rise troponin T ≥0.03µg/l . Other event include clinically indicated coronary arterial revascularization percutaneous coronary angioplasty ( PCI ) coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) . In case 2 simultaneous cardiac event , bad event select ( cardiac death &gt; non-fatal myocardial infarction &gt; revascularization ) .</detailed_description>
