	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , combination sorafenib dacarbazine sarcoma . Recurrent sarcoma difficult treat . Standard chemotherapy drug toxic , length benefit usually short . As result , need new treatment sarcoma . Sorafenib new type `` target '' chemotherapy attack specific protein ( include `` raf '' `` VEGF receptor '' ) cell . We hope block protein cause tumor shrink . Sorafenib also know BAY 43-9006 trade name Nexavar® . The FDA approve sorafenib December 2005 treat patient kidney cancer November 2007 treat patient liver cancer . This drug approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) license authority treatment sarcoma therefore consider experimental setting .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm leiomyosarcoma , synovial sarcoma malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( MPNST ) . Patients metastatic , locally advanced , unresectable locally recurrent disease . Zero two prior chemotherapy regimen include neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy . Measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 . Age ≥ 18 . Karnofsky performance status 50 % 100 % . Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function assess follow : Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 Total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 time ULN ALT AST &lt; = 2.5 time ULN ( &lt; = 5 x ULN patient liver involvement ) Creatinine &lt; = 1.5 time ULN Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior start treatment . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Patients use adequate birth control least three month last administration sorafenib . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . A sign informed consent must obtain prior study specific procedure . INR &lt; 1.5 PT/PTT within normal limit anticoagulation . Patients receive anticoagulation treatment agent warfarin heparin may allow participate . For patient warfarin , INR measure prior initiation sorafenib monitor least weekly , define local standard care , INR stable . Prior therapy dacarbazine , sorafenib antiangiogenic agent . Chemotherapy within 3 week radiotherapy within 2 week first day protocol therapy . More two prior chemotherapy regimen . Known brain metastasis . Patients neurological symptom must undergo CT scan/MRI brain exclude brain metastasis . Pregnancy nursing . Social situation psychiatric illness would limit compliance study requirement . Cardiac disease : Congestive heart failure &gt; class II NYHA . Patients must unstable angina ( anginal symptom rest ) new onset angina ( begin within last 3 month ) myocardial infarction within past 6 month . Cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy . Uncontrolled hypertension define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg 24 hour , despite optimal medical management . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection chronic Hepatitis B C. Active clinically serious infection &gt; CTCAE Grade 2 . Thrombotic embolic event cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack myocardial infarction within past 6 month , deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism within two month . Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; = CTCAE Grade 2 within 4 week first dose study drug . Any hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; = CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 week first dose study drug . Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . Evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Any history grade 4 thrombocytopenia ( Plt &lt; 25,000 ) , Grade 3 thrombocytopenia ( Plt &lt; 50,000 , &gt; 25,000 ) last 7 day longer , history platelet transfusion chemotherapy induce thrombocytopenia Major surgery , open biopsy significant traumatic injury within 4 week first study drug . Use St. John 's Wort rifampin ( rifampicin ) . Known suspected allergy sorafenib agent give course trial . Any condition impair patient 's ability swallow pill . Any malabsorption problem opinion investigator would interfere patient ability tolerate oral sorafenib .</criteria>
