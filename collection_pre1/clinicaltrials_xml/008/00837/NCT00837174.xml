	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine rate response drug bortezomib ( Velcade ) vorinostat ( Zolinza ) , use combination , patient relapse ( recurrent ) and/or refractory ( difficult treat ) non-Hodgkin Lymphoma , determine safety tolerability regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relapsed and/or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More selective less toxic therapeutic strategy need improve cure rate prolong survival patient relapse and/or refractory non-Hodgkin Lymphoma . Amongst multiple new pathway recently study two emerge potentially important target new agent lymphoma . These include ubiquitin proteasome pathway biochemical reaction control histone acetylation . The first two agent class study lymphoma : bortezomib vorinostat . Bortezomib grant FDA approval treatment mantle cell lymphoma establish activity variety B-cell lymphoma include follicular , marginal zone diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Vorinostat SAHA ( suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ) FDA approve treatment refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma also show activity lymphoma . Synergistic activity vorinostat bortezomib observe different cell line . The propose study phase II trial combination vorinostat bortezomib recommend dose-schedule patient recurrent and/or refractory lymphoma , indolent aggressive , B T .</detailed_description>
