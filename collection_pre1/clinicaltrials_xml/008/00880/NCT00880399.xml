	<brief_summary>This 6-week , randomise , multicenter , double-blind , placebo control , fix dose parallel group study assess efficacy safety orvepitant ( 30 60 mg/day ) versus placebo subject diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder , whose symptom consider moderate severe . Following initial screen visit , subject fulfil study inclusion exclusion criterion enter pre-treatment screen phase permit evaluation laboratory ECG assessment confirm eligibility inclusion study . This screen phase minimum 7 day , longer 21 day . At completion screen period , eligible subject randomise baseline visit receive either orvepitant 30mg/day , orvepitant 60mg/day placebo ( equal chance receive three possible treatment , i.e. , 1:1:1 ratio ) six-week double-blind treatment phase . Those subject randomise receive placebo receive study medication identical appearance receive subject assign receive orvepitant 30 60mg/day . Efficacy assess via standard depression symptom severity rating scale questionaires . The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) use primary measure . Secondary efficacy endpoint include Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology ( QIDS-SR ) Clinical Global Impression- Global Improvement Severity Illness Scale ( CGI-I CGI-S , respectively ) . Safety assess monitor adverse event ( side effect ) periodic laboratory evaluation ( blood test ) , vital sign assessment ( e.g. , blood pressure , heart rate , temperature ) heart function measurement ( electrocardiogram , ECGs ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose current study test safety anti-depressant effect orvepitant , investigational antidepressant . Efficacy assess use standard depression symptom severity rating scale ( questionaires ) . The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) serve primary measure efficacy , . Secondary efficacy endpoint include Bech Melancholia Scale ( sum item 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 13 17-item HAM-D scale ) , Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology ( QIDS-SR ) , Clinical Global Impression- Global Improvement Severity Illness Scale ( CGI-I CGI-S , respectively ) , HAM-D anxiety factor score ( sum item 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 17 ) , Cognitive Physical Function Questionnaire ( CPFQ ) morning sleep questionnaire . Safety tolerability assess monitoring adverse event ( AEs side effect ) , physical examination ( include vital sign blood pressure heart rate ) , clinical laboratory assessment ( blood test ) , electrical recording heart ( electrocardiograms ECG 's ) , Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) , Sexual Function Questionnaire ( SFQ ) , weight change . Blood sample take different time point assess blood level orvepitant patient , allow relationship amount orvepitant body efficacy study . The primary objective study evaluate antidepressant efficacy orvepitant ( 30 60mg/day ) versus placebo ( `` sugar pill '' , active ingredient ) . The secondary objective include assess safety tolerability orvepitant , assess profile appearance disappearance orvepitant body ( blood ) follow administration ( i.e. , assess long drug remain body ) , lastly examine relationship blood level drug efficacy ( i..e , change HAM-D total score relative start study medication . Following initial screen visit , subject fulfil study entrance criterion enter pre-treatment screen phase permit evaluation laboratory electrocardiogram assessment confirm eligibility inclusion study . This screen phase minimum 7 day , longer 21 day . During screen period , subject may undergo three different assessment depressive symptom , may occur via face-to-face interview via interview telephone . Upon completion screen period , eligible subject randomly assign baseline visit one three treatment regimen : orvepitant 30mg/day , orvepitant 60mg/day placebo six-week treatment phase . The chance receive three possible treatment equal . Orvepitant administer tablet . Those subject randomise receive placebo receive study medication identical appearance receive subject assign receive orvepitant . During treatment phase , subject require return clinic end Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 6 . In addition , subject require return follow-up visit 14 day last dose study medication . In addition , subject ongoing adverse event 14-day follow-up visit require return follow-up visit 28 day last dose study medication . Male female outpatient age 18 64 year inclusive primary diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder enrol study . A total approximately 350 subject expect enrol approximately 20 different study sit U.S. Canada .</detailed_description>
