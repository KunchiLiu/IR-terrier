	<brief_title>European Multi-Center Post Market Study IBV Valve System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IBV Valve System ( Spiration Inc. Redmond , WA ) CE Mark approval treatment diseased damage lung . The device one-way valve place airway via flexible bronchoscopy limit airflow distally . For treatment emphysema , valve place airway communicate diseased area lung tissue re-direct airflow less diseased area . A multicenter , blind randomize study valve conduct 7 center 6 European country . The study evaluate effectiveness therapy treatment upper lobe predominant emphysema patient severe severe emphysema ( GOLD classification 3 4 ) despite best medical management continue poor quality life , severe symptom physical limitation . The primary endpoint measure compare response use St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire lung volume change measure CT-scans . Consented patient meet strict inclusion criterion bronchoscopic procedure randomize treatment control ( valve ) group . After procedure , patient stay blind group assignment follow-up evaluation 1 3 month . After 3-month evaluation , patient un-blinded . The treatment group schedule additional follow-up 6 month control group offer valve treatment ( rollover ) evaluate approximately 3 month later .</detailed_description>
