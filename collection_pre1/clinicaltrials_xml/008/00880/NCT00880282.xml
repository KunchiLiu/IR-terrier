	<brief_title>Cixutumumab Temsirolimus Treating Younger Patients With Solid Tumors That Have Recurred Not Responded Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase II dose IMC-A12 ( anti-insulin growth factor-1 receptor monoclonal antibody ) ( cixutumumab ) administer intravenous infusion weekly combination CCI-779 ( temsirolimus ) administer intravenously weekly child refractory solid tumor . II . To define describe toxicity IMC-A12 combination temsirolimus administer schedule . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics IMC-A12 combination temsirolimus child refractory cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity combination IMC-A12 temsirolimus within confines Phase I study . II . To assess biologic activity IMC-A12 assessing : change insulin-like growth factor receptor ( IGFR ) expression phosphorylation insulin-receptor expression phosphorylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMNC ) . III . To assess biological activity temsirolimus measuring level phosphorylated ( phosphor ) -ribosomal protein S6 kinase , 70kDa , polypeptide 1 ( S6K1 ) , phosphor-protein kinase B ( AKT ) , phosphor-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma , 1 ( eIF4G ) PBMNC . IV . To assess incidence IGFR expression well mechanistic target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway activation recurrent refractory solid tumor childhood . OUTLINE : Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 25 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
