	<brief_summary>Rotavirus lead cause severe diarrhea infant young child , account 45 % severe diarrhea disease develop develop country . Annually , rotavirus cause approximately 111 million episode gastroenteritis require home care , 25 million clinic visit , 2 million hospitalization , approximately 440,000 death child le 5 year age , approximately 90 % hospitalization 99 % death occur develop country . Although rotavirus infection common HIV-infected child , complicates care interfere nutrition . Chances death infection great HIV-infected child also suffer waste , malnutrition , and/or opportunistic infection . The primary purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity Rotavirus vaccine candidate , RotaTeq , HIV-infected uninfected child bear HIV-infected mother .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network ( IMPAACT ) P1072 international Phase II randomize double-blind study assess safety immunogenicity live , attenuated rotavirus vaccine ( RotaTeq ) HIV-1 infect ( n=160 ) uninfected ( n=160 ) child bear HIV-1 infected mother . Infants 2 &lt; 15 week age screening assign one four stratum , base HIV-1 status HIV-1 infect , Cluster Differentiation percentage ( CD4 % ) [ ≥ 20 % ( n=80 ) , 15 % ≤ CD4 % &lt; 20 % ( n=60 ) &lt; 15 % ( n=20 ) ] . Screening complete first dose study vaccine administer participant 4 &lt; 15 week age . Within stratum infant randomize receive either active RotaTeq vaccine ( three dose 2.0 mL interval 4 10 week third dose administer 32 week age ) placebo schedule . Participants follow six week last dose vaccine , visit 7 , 14 , 21 42 day dose . The day 42 visit first two study dos require next study vaccination do 42 day previous dose . At visit , data record adverse event observe caretaker investigator , include signs/symptoms ≥ grade 1 new clinically significant diagnosis . No hematology chemistry test require protocol , site could record laboratory result database result pertinent . Stool sample fecal shed collected entry , day 7 , 14 , 21 42 first vaccination , 7 21 day second third vaccination , unplanned visit gastroenteritis . Serum immunogenicity test collect entry 14 day ( 42 day collect 14 day ) third vaccination . In January 2012 , rotavirus vaccine ( Rotarix ) become available standard care Lusaka study site Zambia , enrollment cease site . Infants already enrol within age range could receive Rotarix series unblinded . Those placebo give Rotarix . Those active vaccine arm continue receive study vaccine . All infant continue attend study visit . A similar procedure follow July 2012 , Rotarix become available standard care Botswana . During 2013 , Zimbabwe site enrol participant , HIV-1 uninfected . The team decide close study enrollment prematurely end September 2013 total 126 HIV-1 uninfected ( 79 % target 160 ) 76 HIV-1 infect ( 48 % target : 81 % CD4 % ≥ 20 % 14 % CD4 % &lt; 20 % ) . Because low enrollment HIV-1 infect infant low CD4 % , result HIV-1 infected stratum report combined across CD4 % stratum . Baseline characteristic present 'as-randomized ' . Safety data present 'as-randomized ' include follow-up study 42 day third vaccination . Immunogenicity result present 'per-protocol ' population include participant receive 'as-randomized ' vaccine complete three vaccination within require window ( first vaccination 4 &lt; 15 week age , subsequent vaccination least 28 day previous vaccination , third dose 32 week age ) .</detailed_description>
