	<brief_summary>The next influenza pandemic expect spread rapidly resource-poor setting . Influenza viruses spread human-to-human via large respiratory droplet . Transmission via large-particle respiratory droplet believe mediate close contact infect susceptible person contact droplet-contaminated fomite . Close contact infect susceptible person may consist skin-to-skin contact ( e.g. , via hand ) inhalation respiratory droplet ( e.g. , due talk , cough , sneeze infected person ) . Airborne transmission , expect result transmission long distance ( &gt; 1 meter ) would mediate ventilation , believe uncommon . Therefore , great risk transmission personal contact come people closest index case , contact live household . There , date , publish estimate secondary attack ratio influenza among household contact index case-patients low-income country . Moreover , investigator data risk factor secondary transmission influenza index case-patients household contact . There data benefit promote handwash soap risk all-cause acute respiratory illness among child &lt; 15 year old resource-poor setting Pakistan . But , investigator evidence promote handwash soap acutely reduce risk secondary transmission . Therefore , investigator propose conduct study rural Bangladesh ass follow : - The secondary attack ratio influenza among household contact index case-patient influenza - The risk factor secondary transmission influenza index case-patient household contact - The impact promote handwash soap risk secondary transmission influenza index case-patient household contact - The impact handwash promotion handwash behavior six month intervention - The impact handwash promotion prevalence respiratory infection , diarrhea influenza</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BISTIS build hospital-based surveillance Influenza virus infection , ongoing hospital around Bangladesh , part Hospital-based Influenza Surveillance ( HBIS ) Surveillance Epidemiology Influenza Bangladesh ( SEIB ) project . We intend recruit patient identify Jahurul Islam Medical College Hospital Kishoregonj , Bangladesh , HBIS SEIB place . In hospital 80 % patient present influenza-like illness ( ILI ) outpatient department Medicine Pediatrics three upazillas Kishorgonj district : Bajitpur , Kuliar char Kotiadi . The distance three upazillas within 30 minute travel time Jahurul Islam Medical College Hospital ( one way ) hence upazillas serve primary catchment area BISTIS . The table illustrate number ILI case identify HBIS SEIB study Jahurul Islam Medical College Hospital 2008 also number proportion among tested PCR positive influenza virus . n.b. , influenza-positive specimen collect May September 2007 2008 We also enroll patient present two local upazilla health complex ( UHCs ) , one Bajitpur one Kuliar Char . These local health complex see numerous patient day rural area surround clinic . Patients present clinic likely symptom onset within 24 hour presentation patient seek care JIMCH , since patient may want go hospital illness severe prolong several day . Some study impact handwash promotion find intervention effective deliver within 36 hour index case-patient 's symptom onset ; therefore , UHC sit appropriate enrollment patient BISTIS addition enrollment JIMCH . Lastly , recruit patient pharmacy within catchment area mention . By collaborate local pharmacist , intend increase enrollment number . Patients present local pharmacist likely symptom onset within 24 hour visit pharmacist also likely primary case within bari . Specific Aim 1 : To measure secondary attack ratio ( SAR ) influenza virus among household contact index case influenza , rural set Bangladesh Methods Specific Aim 1 Specimen collection process A trained study physician procure nasal swab oropharyngeal swab consent index case-patients meeting inclusion criterion use standardized method . At Jahurul Islam Medical College Hospital , nasal oropharyngeal swab place single tube contain viral transport medium ( VTM ) . An aliquot VTM test Influenza A B trained physician nurse use rapid antigen detection test ( QuickVue® Influenza A + B ) . If QuickVue® result positive Influenza A Influenza B , remain VTM keep 4°C . All VTM transport ICDDR , B virology laboratory Dhaka weekly basis . At ICDDR , B virology laboratory , RT-PCR test Influenza A ( H1N1 ) , Influenza A ( H3N2 ) , Influenza B carry . If Influenza A H1N1 A H3N2 negative , RT-PCR test Influenza A H5N1 perform . If QuickVue® result negative Influenza A Influenza B , patient inform result thank participate study . The VTM discard use appropriate infection control procedure , unless patient also participate ongoing HBIS SEIB ( case remain specimen process like surveillance specimen ) . Enumeration bari contact questionnaire administration Illness track among bari contact Illness track carry day 10 day resolution index case-patient 's illness . Resolution define lack fever , cough , sore throat least 24 hour precede FRA 's daily illness track visit . Thus , index case-patient 's illness resolve day 4 enrollment , illness track continue day 14 enrollment . The FRA visit patient 's home record information regard presence absence ILI SARI symptom household contact use individual illness track form ( appendix 9a8a 9b8b - illness track form , age ≥ 5 &lt; 5 ) . For purpose screen household contact influenza , alter age-specific case definition child , base data urban Bangladesh , demonstrate fever rhinorrhea predictive factor influenza child &lt; 5 year old ( WA Brooks , ICDDR , B , personal communication ) . If household contact meet age-specific case definition NOT danger sign , FRA obtain write informed consent specimen collection ( appendix 2- specimen collection household contact adult &gt; 18 year old , ( appendix 3 - specimen collection household contact child &lt; 18 year old ) . The FRA alert medical officer , visit home FRA later follow day order collect nasal oropharyngeal swab ill household contact . She immediately place swabs VTM , place cool box , contain ice thermometer ensure temperature &lt; 40 C. All specimens collect field place cool box transport ICDDR , B laboratory within 72 hour . At ICDDR , B virology laboratory , specimens household contact test use RT-PCR Influenza A ( H1N1 ) , A ( H3N2 ) , Influenza B ( A ( H5N1 ) appropriate ) . Illness track among household contact continue household 10th full day follow resolution index case-patient 's symptom , irrespective whether household contact develop illness . Specific Aim 2 : To test efficacy handwash promotion intervention prevention intrahousehold transmission influenza virus Methods Specific Aim 2 To address specific aim , conduct randomize controlled trial . Households index case-patients influenza-like illness recruit Jahurul Islam Medical College Hospital UHCs local pharmacy randomize intervention group routine practice group . The two group define : - Intervention Households : intensive promotion handwash soap , provision facilitating tool , index-case-patient available household contact - Routine practice Households : continuation household 's usual handwashing respiratory hygiene practice group . For promotion handwash soap intervention household , Field Intervention Specialists ( FIS ) train carry structure intervention follow construct Social Cognitive Theory ( SCT ) . SCT address reciprocal interaction individual , environment , health behavior . Given intervention occur bari level , group-mediated construct observational learn reinforcement highly relevant . FISs visit intervention household daily basis 10 day resolution index case-patient 's illness order encourage handwash soap recommend time . Routine practice household also expose intervention , upon completion study . As noted , Specific Aim 1 , FRA visit home index case-patient daily 10 day resolution index case-patient 's symptom order record age-specific case define symptom . Specific aim 3 : To identify risk factor , handwash soap , intrahousehold transmission influenza rural setting Bangladesh . Methods Specific Aim 3 To address Specific Aim 3 , conduct nest cohort study ass risk factor intrahousehold transmission influenza virus . Here , cohort investigation routine practice group , define Specific Aim 2 . All data require address Specific Aim 3 collect part data collection describe Specific Aim 1 . A case define : RT-PCR confirm Influenza virus infection ( A B ) household contact RT-PCR confirm Influenza virus infection ( A B ) index case-patient 10 day follow-up resolution index case-patient 's symptom . Specific aim 4 : To assess whether exposure BISTIS intervention result sustain improvement handwash behavior . Methods Specific Aim 4 To address Specific Aim 4 , visit bari enrol intervention study 4 - 7 month illness track complete . The FRA measure handwash behavior bari . We complete structure observation bari 's common handwashing behavior . One two month initial follow-up visit , FRA return bari collect information handwash behavior also provide soap bari . The FRA collect soap two day later . Data soap use calculate number soap use event bari . In total FRA visit household total three time , two visit data collection one visit collect soap . Specific aim 5 : To assess exposure BISTIS intervention result reduce risk respiratory infection , diarrhea , influenza . Methods Specific Aim 5 The measurement health outcomes do two different way . At first visit , handwash behavior information collect , FRA record whether member bari symptom fever , cough , sore throat , difficulty breathing , respiratory illness diarrhea previous 48 hour . At third visit , April 2010 , FRA record mobile phone number two three bari member . The FRA identify key informant , able provide information regard fever bari member . The FRA phone bari week influenza season speak key informant per week ass whether bari member fever previous 24 hour . If member report fever , dispatch MO lab/medical technician bari obtain nasopharyngeal swab member flu test PCR . A case define : RT-PCR confirm Influenza virus infection ( A B ) .</detailed_description>
