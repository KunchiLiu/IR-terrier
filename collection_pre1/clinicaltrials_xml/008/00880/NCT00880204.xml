	<brief_title>Evaluation Essential Surgical Skills-Emergency Maternal Child Health ( ESS-EMCH ) Training Assessing Doctors ' Practices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pakistan 6th populous country world 1 large population Eastern Mediterranean Region , account 30 percent regional population . The level socio-economic development still low - GDP per caput US $ 7302 ; HDI 142nd world 1 ; , one fourth entire population live poverty line 2 . The health profile Pakistan characterize high population growth rate , high infant child mortality rate , high maternal mortality ratio , high burden communicable disease . In conjunction neonatal , infant child mortality , maternal mortality ratio also extremely high 350 per 100,000 population Pakistan 3 . In addition , 23 percent delivery conduct skilled birth attendant major cause mortality include hemorrhage , hypertensive disease , sepsis obstetrical complication 4 . Although health facility available ubiquitously , facility lack proper equipment train health worker . Health worker also lack necessary skill train manage child , newborns mother emergency situation . Management first hour - Golden hour 5 presentation obstetric , neonatal pediatric emergency , include major trauma ( give immediate attention likely result death severe brain damage 6 hour ) major determinant eventual outcome . If vast majority potentially avoidable death long-term permanent morbidity avoid , continuity care particular emphasis golden hour management safe transfer establish start community health facility 6 . There evidence structure life support training introduce systematic method help reduce mortality morbidity emergency phase cost effective manner 4 . Local public sector hospital need configure serve community provide episodic care patient transiently pass door acute episode . It mandatory upgrade knowledge first line health worker manage emergency situation . It also necessary elevate capacity recognize common emergency manage accordingly . By institute accredit structured training skill dramatically decrease mortality morbidity rate Pakistan 6 . The training activity Essential Surgical Skills emphasis Emergency Maternal Child Health ( ESS-EMCH ) base two tried test structured training methodology Advanced Pediatric Life Support ( APLS ) Management Obstetric Emergencies Trauma ( MOET ) . The ESS-EMCH training programme conduct Child Health Advocacy International ( CAI ) Pakistan Gambia 6 . The Advanced Life Support Group-UK ( ALSG-UK ) World Health Organization ( WHO ) provide technical support training programme endorse first ALSG-UK certify train course target specifically develop country 7 . These course use year various develop country essential requirement health worker involve emergency care specialty . In Pakistan training activity modify accord local need condition 6 . The aim propose study determine , degree , specific train management general , obstetric , neonatal pediatric emergency result change practice doctor work emergency department public sector hospital three district Pakistan . The overall goal propose study test ability standard course ( 5-days training ) promote provision effective evidence base practice public sector hospital setting . Justification : Improving mortality morbidity emergency phase present major challenge many develop country include Pakistan . It important health worker work public health facility district level necessary skill equipment provide effective management emergency phase . Research show structure life support training help reduce mortality morbidity emergency phase cost effective manner 4 . However , evaluation course participant pose major problem , rarely possible develop perfect test method , awareness inherent limitation evaluation method use life support course important 8 . Jabbour colleague review effectiveness life support course find majority study evaluation ability life support course focus less direct outcome like health worker ' knowledge silk 9 . Such surrogate outcome may necessarily reflect practice change , useful direct way measure effectiveness life support training course 9 . We aware previous randomize controlled trial determine effect ESS-EMCH training health worker practice true clinical setting . Therefore , intention test ability ESS-EMCH training practice randomly assign pediatric ward , labor room emergency department staff district level either provide ESS-EMCH training training , consider health worker unit cluster . Although , primary outcome able capture initial step effective practice , believe indicate important behavior change effect .</detailed_description>
