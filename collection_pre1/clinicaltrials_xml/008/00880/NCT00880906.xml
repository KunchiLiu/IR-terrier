	<brief_summary>This study patient food impaction and/or difficulty swallowing , schedule endoscopy , biopsy possibly dilatation ( stretch ) esophagus . Standard treatment people food impaction difficulty swallow endoscopy view esophagus , tissue biopsy line esophagus diagnosis , drug therapy include steroid drug use treat reflux disease . Early dilatation stretch esophagus may do time always . Some doctor prefer wait see drug affective . It know dilate esophagus early treatment add benefit . Therefore , study compare two method treatment . We compare two group : one group dilatation perform first endoscopy one group dilatation perform endoscopy . We see dilatation help prevent food impaction improve swallow . Another purpose study learn cause swallow problem , thus extra biopsy take esophagus store future research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Efficiency Esophageal Dilation Patient With Eosinophilic Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EE ) inflammatory condition esophagus find pediatric adult population . It characterize intense eosinophilic infiltration surface line esophagus . EE become increasingly recognize diagnosis individual present food bolus impaction dysphagia . A history chronic solid food dysphagia , food impaction young age note characteristic patient subsequently diagnose EE . Eosinophilic esophagitis suspect clinical presentation histologic confirmation necessary definitive diagnosis . The find large number eosinophil ( &gt; 15 per high powered field ) biopsy specimen need confirm EE . Endoscopic feature mucosal ring , linear furrow , proximal stricture white esophageal papule describe patient EE . The underlie pathophysiology EE poorly understand think associate TH2-type allergic inflammatory response . Other study also suggest immune dysregulation may play role underlie pathophysiology disorder . The optimal treatment EE determine . There study note swallow fluticasone propionate ( FP ) , inhale corticosteroid , show benefit adult pediatric patient EE . Esophageal dilation use patient EE persistent dysphagia food impaction . No study evaluate improvement dysphagia incidence future food bolus impaction patient treat early esophageal dilation . Our aim determine esophageal dilation standard drug therapy improve symptom dysphagia . We also plan obtain store esophageal biopsy specimens future immunologic assessment help determine underlying pathophysiology Eosinophilic Esophagitis .</detailed_description>
