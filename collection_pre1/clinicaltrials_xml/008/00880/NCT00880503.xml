	<brief_summary>Background : Resistance cancer chemotherapy develop patient , render certain treatment ineffective . Despite much research , prevail cause drug resistance know . One mechanism drug resistance involve protein call P-glycoprotein , Pgp , reduce effectiveness cancer treatment `` pump '' anti-cancer drug tumor cell suppose work disease . Objectives : To identify evaluate thoroughly role Pgp substance mediate drug resistance . Eligibility : Patients enrol clinical trial cancer therapies Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh ; Cancer Centers Carolinas ; Arizona Clinical Research Center ; University Copenhagen ; Herlev Hospital , Copenhagen consent use blood , tissue , tumor sample laboratory study . Design : Blood , tumor , tissue sample collect participant send NCI various laboratory analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Tissue Samples Study Multidrug Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Ultimately , patient succumb cancer drug resistance . Mechanisms drug resistance explore laboratory clinical sample time , yet prevail cause drug resistance , indeed single cause , know . One mechanism drug resistance multidrug efflux , mediate P-glycoprotein . Other mechanism propose . Our laboratory expertise analysis drug transporter expression activity clinical sample . Objectives : To determine expression P-glycoprotein multidrug transporter think mediate clinical drug resistance . To evaluate inhibition P-glycoprotein multidrug transporter assessment efflux activity cell obtain patient enrolled clinical trial institution . To identify evaluate mechanism drug resistance use molecular assay cDNA array , real-time PCR analysis , immunohistochemistry . Eligibility : Patients enrol clinical trial outside NCI , give informed consent use blood , tissue , tumor sample evaluation mechanisms drug resistance evaluation inhibition multi-drug efflux . Future collaboration similar study add via protocol amendment procedure ; molecular study ABC transporter assay add via protocol amendment procedure . Design : Human tumor biopsy blood sample collect cancer patient enrol approved clinical trial , accordance local protocol . These trial conduct outside institution , sample send NCI immunohistochemical analysis , cDNA array , PCR analysis , blood assay detection P-glycoprotein inhibition .</detailed_description>
