	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , ifosfamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving sorafenib together ifosfamide may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give sorafenib together ifosfamide see well work treat patient high-grade soft tissue sarcoma bone sarcoma remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Ifosfamide Treating Patients With High-Grade Soft Tissue Sarcoma Bone Sarcoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess safety , toxicity , efficacy neoadjuvant sorafenib tosylate ifosfamide patient resectable high-grade soft tissue bone sarcoma . Secondary - Assess long-term efficacy impact therapy patient , term duration local recurrence-free survival , distant recurrence-free survival , disease-specific survival . OUTLINE : - Neoadjuvant therapy : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-14 course 1 . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-28 ifosfamide IV continuously day 1-7 course 2 3 . Treatment repeat every 14-28 days* 3 course . NOTE : *Course 1 14 day duration ; course 2 3 28 day duration . - Surgery : At least 1 week completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo surgery . - Adjuvant therapy : Beginning ≥ 3 week surgery , patient respond neoadjuvant therapy receive oral sorafenib twice daily 6 month . Patients also receive 2 course ifosfamide course 2 3 neoadjuvant therapy .</detailed_description>
