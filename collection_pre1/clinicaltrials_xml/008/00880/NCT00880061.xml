	<brief_summary>Background : - Diffusely infiltrate pontine glioma ( DIPG ) supratentorial high-grade glioma ( HGG ) brain tumor often difficult treat . It difficult get chemotherapy agent tumor brain , researcher look new method directly treat type cancer . - IL-13 immune molecule normally occur body . Patients gliomas appear significant amount IL-13 receptor brain tumor . An experimental drug , IL13-PE38QQR , combine bacteria toxin human IL-13 allow toxin enter destroy tumor cell . Early clinical study suggest treatment may prolong survival patient type brain tumor . - A technique call convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) use continuous pressure push large molecule membrane protect brain reach brain tumor . This technique treat tumor directly traditional method . Objectives : - To test safety feasibility give IL13-PE38QQR directly regions brain pediatric patient DIPG HGG , use CED . - To determine appropriate dose IL13-PE38QQR treat DIPG HGG . - To determine effect experimental therapy tumor . - To evaluate physical change tumor therapy . Eligibility : - Patients le 18 year age diagnose either DIPG supratentorial HGG respond well standard treatment . Design : - Patients admitted hospital receive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan show exact location tumor . A small plastic tube insert surgically tumor area , IL13-PE38QQR MRI contrast agent ( gadolinium DTPA ) infuse area . - MRI scan monitor process , tube remove surgery . - Doses adjusted course study . - Patients respond well treatment may eligible receive second infusion , sooner 4 week first treatment . - Post-treatment visit : Clinic visit 4 8 week treatment , every 8 week 1 year . - Physical examination neurological testing , MRI , standard blood urine test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Dose Escalation Safety Study Convection-Enhanced Delivery IL13-PE38QQR Patients With Progressive Pediatric Diffuse Infiltrating Brainstem Glioma Supratentorial High-grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary purpose study test safety feasibility give new experimental agent , call IL13-PE38QQR , directly region brain patient diffusely infiltrate pontine glioma ( DIPG ) recurrent progressive supratentorial high-grade glioma ( HGG ) use technique call convection-enhanced delivery CED . CED use continuous pressure push large molecule membrane protect brain reach brain tumor . At time , watch molecule go brain attaching tracer , gadolinium-DTPA , IL13-PE38QQR , see brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Because know best dose use patient DIPG HGG , give increase amount IL13-PE38QQR small group patient type brain tumor , know dose escalation study . Secondary purpose study include determine effect experimental therapy tumor , evaluate physical change tumor therapy . Study Population : Twenty-right pediatric patient recurrent progressive DIPG supratentorial HGG undergone standard treatment meet Inclusion Exclusion Criteria may enrol . Eighteen patient receive treatment ; additional ten patient may screen failure unevaluable . Design : We propose Phase I single institution , open label , dose escalation ( dose 0.125 , 0.25 0.5 micrograms/ml ) , safety tolerability study IL13-PE38QQR infused via CED patient either DIPG ( 9 patient ) recurrent HGG ( 9 patient ) . IL13-PE38QQR administered region tumor determine radiographic finding . Escalating dose level evaluate follow dose cohort ( 3 patient per Cohort ) : Cohort 1 = 0.125 micrograms/ml , Cohort 2 = 0.25 micrograms/ml Cohort 3 = 0.5 micrograms/ml . Outcome Measures : To assess safety , tolerability potential efficacy CED IL13-PE38QQR , use detailed clinical radiographic examination . These performed baseline post-infusion day 1 , 28 60 . After post-infusion day 60 , clinical radiographic study perform every 8 week image clinical evidence recurrence/progressive disease new treatment initiate .</detailed_description>
