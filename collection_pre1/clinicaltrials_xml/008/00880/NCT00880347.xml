	<brief_summary>The objective study define performance blood-based signature Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) different patient population include AD , non-AD dementia , non-demented control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Gene Expression Signature Patients Diagnosed With Probable Alzheimer 's Disease Compared Patients Suffering From Other Types Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective study define performance blood-based transcriptomic signature AD , identify use SpliceArray tm technology , intend use population patient suffer dementia , include AD common non-AD dementia ( Lewy Bodies dementia , vascular dementia , fronto-temporal dementia , dementia due Parkinson 's Disease , mixed dementia ) . A group non-demented subject serve control reference .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . AD group : Male female patient , age ≥ 40 year old include entry . Patients clinical diagnosis probable AD accord DSMIV TR [ F00.xx ] National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke/Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ( NINCDSADRDA ) criterion . Written inform consent obtain patient , appropriate , legal representative accord local law regulation . Evidence brain imaging ( either cerebral CTscan cerebral MRI ) perform settle AD diagnosis , result compatible AD diagnosis . Neurological exam without particularity without specific focal sign likely related condition AD . Patient compliant study procedure . 2 . Non AD demented group : Male female patient , age ≥ 40 year old include entry . Patients clinical diagnosis dementia one following : VaD accord NINDSAIREN criterion , LBD accord McKeith 's criterion , , FTD accord Neary 's Lund &amp; Manchester criterion , PDD accord DSMIV TR criterion [ F02.x ] , Mixed dementia define study patient fulfil DSMIV TR criterion [ F02.8 ] dementia multiple aetiology focus dementia Alzheimer type secondary occurrence vascular dementia . Written inform consent obtain patient , appropriate , legal representative accord local law regulation . Evidence brain imaging ( either cerebral CTscan cerebral MRI ) perform settle diagnosis dementia , result compatible diagnosis dementia . Absence sign symptom may well relate another type dementia current dementia diagnosis . Patient compliant study procedure . 3 . Cognitive impairmentfree control group : Male female subject , age ≥ 60 year old include entry . Written inform consent obtain subject . Absence spontaneously report significant cognitive complaint subject entry . MMSE ≥ 27 entry . Subject impairment daily living activity . Subject compliant study procedure . 1 . AD group : Any pathology , medical condition symptom may lead reconsider initial diagnosis probable AD , may rend initial diagnosis probable AD doubtful entry , accord opinion investigator . Current recent history drug alcohol abuse dependence . Diagnostic Mild Cognitive Impairment define subjective complaint patient regard memory and/or cognitive symptom , objective memory and/or cognitive impairment test meeting AD diagnostic criterion , affect daily living activity . Current diagnosis brain tumour . Any current pathology medical condition , blood sampling may involve risk patient 's health , accord opinion investigator . Pregnancy . Patient register `` Sécurité Sociale '' . Current participation another study use investigational nonmarketed product . 2 . NonAD demented group : Any pathology , medical condition symptom may lead reconsider initial diagnosis dementia patient suffering , may rend initial diagnosis dementia doubtful entry , accord opinion investigator . Diagnostic Mild Cognitive Impairment define subjective complaint patient regard memory and/or cognitive symptom , objective memory and/or cognitive impairment test meeting diagnostic criterion dementia , affect daily living activity . Current diagnosis brain tumour . Any current pathology medical condition blood sampling may involve risk patient 's health , accord opinion investigator . Current recent history drug alcohol abuse dependence . Pregnancy . Patient register `` Sécurité Sociale '' . Current participation another study use investigational nonmarketed product . 3 . Cognitive impairmentfree control group : Subject spontaneously complain significant cognitive impairment . Known family history dementia . Diagnosis type dementia ( either AD nonAD dementia ) , Mild Cognitive Impairment , current past history CNS pathology ( include limit brain injury , brain tumour , stroke , normal pressure hydrocephalus , Parkinson 's disease , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , … ) may responsible occurrence dementia . History current clinically significant psychiatric pathology ( include limit psychotic disorder , bipolar disorder , personality disorder ) . Current major depressive disorder , either treat , associate clinically significant symptom . Any current pathology medical condition blood sampling may involve risk subject 's health , accord opinion investigator . Current recent history ( within one month ) clinically significant pathology , medical condition ( include hospitalization ) symptom . However , chronic disease medical condition consider stable accepted , provide compatible study selection criterion . Current recent history drug alcohol abuse dependence . Subject register `` Sécurité Sociale '' . Current participation another study use investigational nonmarketed product .</criteria>
