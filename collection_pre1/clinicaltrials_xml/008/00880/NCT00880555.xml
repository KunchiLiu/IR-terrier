	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) often manifest memory disorder dementia develop . Dementia consider present person longer handle complex activity daily live , manage finance . This study investigate relationship change ability manage finance brain perfusion , measure use continuous arterial spin-labeling ( experimental MRI ) . Subjects also undergo neuropsychological test focus several type memory thought process , special emphasis semantic memory . An important question address whether change function well predict neuropsychological test brain scan . Participants undergo single MRI scan , baseline financial capacity instrument ( FCI ) cognitive evaluation , follow approximately annually repeat functional cognitive assessment . Linear mixed effect model use fit model predict financial capacity base baseline cognitive test . Measures MRI scan add model determine whether image improves prediction .</detailed_description>
