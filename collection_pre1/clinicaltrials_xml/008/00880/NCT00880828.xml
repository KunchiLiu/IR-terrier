	<brief_title>Comparing Two Different Cervical Collars Treatment Patient With Cervical Radiculopathy Radicular Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute neck pain relatively common experience usually decline disappears within couple week . Some patient recover time develop chronic cervical pain nerve root compression may result cervical radiculopathy . Far-infrared ( FIR ) ray one topic energy medicine tremendously study past year . A variety FIR application show enhancement beneficial effect heal therapy , even though limited technical approach systemic study place theoretical study FIR ceramic process emissivity optimizing . The evident difficulty find appropriate cervical radiculopathy therapy initiate current study . The aim study evaluate efficacy FIR cervical collar patient long-lasting cervicobrachial pain ; pain distribution correspond specific nerve root compression reveal MRI electrophysiological study .</detailed_description>
