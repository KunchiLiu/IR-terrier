	<brief_title>Finding Acute Coronary Syndromes ( ACS ) With Serial Troponin Testing Rapid Assessment Cardiac Ischemic Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate ability high sensitivity cardiac troponin I ( hs-cTnI ) assay detect rule-out high-risk ischemic cardiac injury emergency room patient experience sign symptom consistent acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Cardiovascular disease still frequent cause morbidity mortality among industrialized nation . In U.S. , nearly 100 million adult suffer cardiovascular disease . Over 5 million patient present emergency department ( EDs ) annually chief complaint consistent ACS . A majority patient find experience non-cardiac chest pain ( 70-82 % patient ) . Myocardial infarction ( MI , include non-ST-segment elevation MI [ NSTEMIs = 6-10 % patient ] ST-segment elevation MI [ STEMIs = 2-5 % patient ] ) occur 8-15 % patient . Unstable angina ( UA ) , often precursor condition MI , account 10-15 % patient . Together , MI plus UA combine define ACS ( = 18-30 % patient ) . MI cause rupture atherosclerotic plaque coronary artery , lead platelet aggregation thrombus formation extent oxygenation myocardial tissue completely interrupt ( i.e. , total occlusion ) , occurrence degree myocardial necrosis . High concentration cardiac enzyme protein ( e.g. , cardiac troponin I T [ cTnI cTnT ] , CK-MB , myoglobin ) observe blood result significant irreversible injury cardiac tissue distal site rupture secondary arterial occlusion . Current assay detect STEMIs NSTEMIs , definition 2007 AHA/ACC update guideline NSTEMI UA , NSTEMI threshold define 99th percentile upper reference limit [ URL ] cardiac troponin ( cTn ) assay 's reference range healthy subject population , detect currently label `` unstable angina ( UA ) '' ischemia without necrosis . In addition , typically take 4-6 hour , ischemic symptom begin , cardiac troponin rise current commercial assay NSTEMI threshold ( i.e. , upper reference limit [ URL ] = 99th percentile upper reference limit ) . These issue expose sensitivity problem current generation cTn assay , include sensitive test available . UA also associate plaque rupture partial coronary artery occlusion occur , result ischemic pain ( unmeasureable ) necrosis . No rise observable cardiac marker level currently available assay ( best limit detection [ LOD ] ~0.01 ng/mL [ 10 pg/mL ] best URL ~0.03 ng/mL [ 30 pg/mL ] ) . Since test currently available accurately diagnose UA , many UA patient discharge home midst high-risk ischemic event . ( Note : Ischemia modify albumin [ IMA ] market widely use due poor specificity . ) The negative predictive value diagnostic test important regard , increase sensitivity may offset also increase false positive result . As many 2 % ( 30,000 patient ) 4 % ( 60,000 pt ) patient MI UA ( ~750,000 MI patient + ~750,000 UA patient = ~1.5 million total patient risk ) inadvertently discharge ED associate short-term mortality 10 % 26 % ( Duseja Feldman 2004 ) . Missed acute cardiac ischemia one major cause malpractice litigation emergency physician ( Duseja Feldman 2004 ) . Even though chest pain ( symptoms consistent ACS ) patient represent 6 % ED patient volume , estimate 20 % ED-related malpractice dollar expend ischemic heart disease complication ( Rusnak , et al 1989 ) . Therefore , misdiagnosis ischemic cardiac injury great importance human-life economic perspective . In typical hospital ED today , cardiac biomarkers draw result back ED physician within 1.5 hour ( i.e. , therapeutic turnaround time [ TTAT ] ; `` vein brain '' time ) . Some hospital move point-of-care device ( relatively low sensitivity [ URL = 0.080 ng/mL ] ) give result within 10-15 minute , extreme , EDs still dependent central laboratory therapeutic turnaround time 2-4 hour . Most chest pain patient continue discomfort cardiac symptom hold ED chest pain ( observation ) unit 6 23 hour , discharge , allow serial cardiac marker draw . Therefore , keep time point mind , highly sensitive ( e.g. , URL = 0.003 ng/mL ) precise cTn assay ( e.g. , &lt; 20-30 % CV ) take &lt; 1 hour give result may useful hospital ED . Time important , case ischemic heart disease , accurate information important potentially life-saving . The information assay would give ED physician would allow accurate diagnosis currently label `` UA '' discharge patient actually require close monitoring , treatment , follow-up cardiologist 's office . Also , diagnosis MI could make much early ( high sensitivity specificity ) 4-6 hour ED presentation take cTn detect current assay . With cardiac marker assay available diagnose `` UA '' appropriate accuracy precision , development cost-effective , timely ( &lt; 1 hr assay time ) cardiac troponin assay allow accurate measurement cTn concentration 10-100 fold best current assay ' detection limit potential improve ACS patient care . It allow diagnosis ischemic injury `` UA '' patient ED admit appropriately hospital instead send home experience possible cardiac event death . With current therapeutic capability ( e.g. , LMWHs , beta-blockers , glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor , anti-platelet agent ) know low risk future cardiac event mortality , expect early detection MI diagnosis `` UA '' may lead reduction morbidity mortality ACS patient . The need highly sensitive assay cardiac troponin predicate observation URL true reference range nominally healthy subject significantly concentration current assays measure . A new nanoparticle-based , highly sensitive cTnI assay ( i.e. , nano-assay ) appear offer significant technological advantage current macroparticle-based , sensitive assay . The new highly sensitive assay 's LOD ~800 fg/mL ( 800 fg/mL = 0.8 pg/mL = 0.0008 ng/mL ) cardiac troponin I , compare 10 pg/mL ( 0.010 ng/mL ) sensitive cTnI assay currently market . The new assay imprecision ( % CV ) , LOD , &lt; 20-30 % , compare &gt; &gt; 30 % LOD sensitive cTnI assay currently market . The URL reference range healthy subject new assay 2.8 pg/mL ( 0.0028 ng/mL ) , compare 30 pg/mL ( 0.030 ng/mL ) sensitive cTnI assay currently market . Under difference analytical performance , likely majority patient currently label `` UA '' reveal detectable troponin concentration exceed nano-assay 's threshold limit ( i.e. , 2.8 pg/mL = 0.0028 ng/mL ) nanoparticle-based , highly sensitive cTnI assay non-detectable level troponin current macroparticle-based , sensitive cTnI assay . In pilot study , bank serial serum sample ten NSTEMI patient Hospital University Pennsylvania ED evaluate research version nano-assay . These serial sample `` troponin-negative '' old laboratory assay ( laboratory assay URL = 0.6 ng/mL = 600pg/mL ) first 1-3 blood draw . Samples patient presentation , 90min , 180min measure current sensitive assay ( Siemens [ Dade Behring ] Stratus CS ) sensitive assay URL = 0.070ng/mL = 70pg/mL ) experimental highly sensitive assay ( highly sensitive assay URL=0.0028 ng/mL = 2.8 pg/mL ) . None ( 0 % ) , two ( 20 % ) , ten ( 100 % ) ten NSTEMI patient find cTnI positive presentation laboratory , sensitive , highly sensitive assay , respectively . All 10 patient measure &gt; 35pg/mL highly sensitive assay presentation . Three patient remain `` cTnI negative '' &gt; 180 min current sensitive assay . In another research study , sample 100 chest pain patient know ACS ( i.e. , 50 NSTEMI 50 `` UA '' patient ) evaluate . Comparison make laboratory device highly sensitive nano-assay URL 0.0028 ng/mL ( 2.8 pg/mL ) . Using current laboratory assay ( Siemens [ Dade Behring ] Dimension ; URL = 0.100 ng/mL = 100 pg/mL ) , 50 NSTEMI patient cTnI negative first draw , 50 `` UA '' patient cTnI negative throughout stay ED and/or hospital . At presentation ( = 0 hr ) , 7 hr , 24 hr , none ( 0 % ) `` UA '' patient find positive cTnI laboratory instrument . Using nano-assay `` UA '' patient ' serum sample , 48 % , 64 % , 82 % positive cTnI presentation , 2 hr , 7 hr , respectively . For NSTEMI patient presentation ( = 0 hr ) , 7 hr , 24 hr , none ( 0 % ) , 56 % , 98 % , respectively , patient find positive cTnI laboratory instrument . Using nano-assay NSTEMI patient ' serum , 76 % , 98 % , 100 % positive cTnI presentation , 2 hr , 7 hr , respectively . These preliminary result demonstrate potential strength highly sensitive cTnI assay reveal abnormal [ cTnI ] ED presentation may progress MI ( i.e. , NSTEMI STEMI ) detect acute ischemic insult may progress MI ( i.e. , `` UA '' ) . This high sensitivity protein assay may enhance clinical utility test ACS ED cardiac care setting ( e.g. , early detection lead directed therapy , improve risk stratification , early rule-out non-cardiac-related chest pain [ NCCP ] , detection re-infarction ) . The definition myocardial infarction use study mean recently update publish November 27 , 2007 issue Circulation ( Thygesen , et al 2007 ) . Page 18 study protocol contain definition . The definition base cardiac troponin biomarker choice value 99th percentile assay 's reference range population consider abnormal . Therefore , nano-assay 's URL much low current assay 's URL , value nano-assay 's URL current assay 's URL consider `` UA '' current assay consider myocardial infarction measure nano-assay . This may result `` UA '' category remove ACS categorization . There also recent study ( Zethelius , et al 2006 ; Waxman , et al 2006 ) show low cTnI value ( &lt; 30-40 pg/mL ) predict future cardiac event mortality asymptomatic elderly male population ( &gt; 70 year ) symptomatic ED patient cTnI level remain reference ( normal ) range current assay . A highly sensitive assay could detect `` silent '' cardiac damage cTnI range cardiologist 's office ED setting could predictor future risk could direct appropriate therapeutic preventative care .</detailed_description>
