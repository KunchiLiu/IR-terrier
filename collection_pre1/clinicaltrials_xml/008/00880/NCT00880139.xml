	<brief_summary>There much evidence localize low grade inflammatory process may contribute microvascular complication type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus include sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy . Some biomarkers inflammation find elevated diabetes patient correlation biomarkers severity diabetic complication find last year . The relation low grade inflammation microvascular change observe diabetic retinopathy , however , well characterize . In present study patient different stage non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy include . Several marker inflammation measure blood sample . These marker relate vascular factor include flicker-induced vasodilatation marker endothelial dysfunction perifoveal leukocyte velocity density measure blue field entoptic phenomenon . In addition , ophthalmologic status patient assess accord Modified Airlie House classification . A multiple regression model employ study association different method .</brief_summary>
