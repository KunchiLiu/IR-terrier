	<brief_summary>Several important international randomize trial show postoperative chemotherapy contribute improvement 5 year survival rate 4 % patient non-small cell lung cancer complete resection . But overall survival rate relatively low local recurrence still dominant failure pattern stage IIIA ( N2 ) disease even patient receive postoperative chemotherapy . Several meta-analyses show postoperative radiotherapy effect survival improvement patient non-small lung cancer complete resection . However , sub-group analysis base dataset meta-analyses show postoperative radiotherapy conventional radiotherapy might beneficial stage IIIA ( N2 ) disease . The 3D conform radiotherapy increase radiation dose target volume decrease dose risk organ compare conventional radiotherapy . So expected postoperative 3D conform radiotherapy postoperative chemotherapy improve local control overall survival rate stage IIIA ( N2 ) non-small cell lung cancer . Here , investigator design phase III randomize trial compare three year overall disease free survival rate patient completely resect stage IIIA ( N2 ) non-small cell lung cancer receive chemotherapy alone chemotherapy plus 3D conform radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Evaluate Postoperative 3D Conform Radiotherapy Patients With IIIA ( N2 ) Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary : To determine whether administer chemotherapy ( four cycle NP regimen ) plus 3D conform thoracic radiotherapy ( 50 Gy , 2 Gy daily 5 week ) improve 3-year survival compare chemotherapy ( four cycle NP regimen ) alone patient completely resect stage IIIA ( N2 ) non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary : To compare treatment-related toxic effect , failure-free survival , pattern failure . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize study . Patients stratify accord histology ( squamous cell v ) , number mediastinum lymph node , whether N2 disease diagnose operation . Arm I : Patients undergo 3D conform thoracic radiotherapy ( 50 Gy , 2 Gy daily 5 week ) postoperative chemotherapy four cycle NP regimen . Arm II : Patients undergo postoperative chemotherapy four cycle NP regimen . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
