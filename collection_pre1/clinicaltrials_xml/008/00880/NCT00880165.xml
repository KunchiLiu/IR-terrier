	<brief_summary>This research study compare home in-laboratory test veteran suspect obstructive sleep apnea , common breathe disorder sleep . It hop home test equally effective improve quality life low cost in-lab testing . These finding allow veteran great access diagnosis treatment sleep apnea .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The overall goal project improve access care veteran suspect obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , breathe disorder sleep characterize repetitive closure pharyngeal airway . Portable monitor commercially available diagnose participant suspect OSA establish continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) set need treatment . Their application home test widely accept know whether home testing , compare conventional in-lab polysomnograms , cost effective produce similar outcome regard participant adherence CPAP treatment improvement functional impairment . The specific goal propose research address barrier compare functional impact , cost , cost-effectiveness evaluating veteran suspect OSA use home versus in-lab testing . Research Design : In prospective randomize control trial equivalency , participant refer Philadelphia Pittsburgh VA Medical Centers evaluation OSA randomize either exclusively in-lab home test follow baseline assessment . Methodology : In-lab polysomnograms perform diagnose OSA titrate pressure set subsequent CPAP therapy . Self-administered home test consist overnight unattended sleep study follow 1-week autoCPAP titration trial . Objectively assessed CPAP adherence consequent effect subjective objective daytime sleepiness , disease specific general functional impairment , participant preference obtain 1- 3-months start CPAP treatment 3-monthly thereafter end study follow-up . Medical service use cost collect entire observation period . Aim 1 determine participant suspect OSA receive home testing adherence subsequent CPAP treatment functional outcome participant receive in-lab testing . Primary outcome measure 1 ) objectively measure adherence CPAP treatment 2 ) global score Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire ( FOSQ ) ass consequent effect adherence disease specific functional impairment . Secondary functional outcome measure assess subjective ( Epworth Sleepiness Scale ) objective ( Psychomotor Vigilance Test ) daytime sleepiness , general quality life ( SF-12 ) . Hypothesis 1 : Despite difference in-lab versus home test term technology , time participant interact health care professional , environment , clinically significant decline mean CPAP adherence clinically significant reduction functional outcome participant receive home versus in-lab testing . Aim 2 compare difference cost quality-adjusted life year save ( QALYS ) home versus in-lab test estimate cost-effectiveness ratio . Participant preference assess EuroQol ( EQ-5D ) Health Utilities Index 2 ( HUI ) . Hypothesis 2a : Average total health-care delivery cost low veteran receive home test relative receive in-lab testing . Hypothesis 2b : Because believe at-home test low cost equivalent outcome , 90 % confident cost per QALY ratio compare at-home test in-lab test less $ 100,000 . Clinical Relationship : We need determine cost effective way diagnose veteran OSA initiate CPAP treatment . If result show home testing produce clinical outcome significantly clinically inferior similar reduce cost compare in-lab testing , decision maker confident home monitor use diagnose treat OSA improve veteran ' access care OSA need require construction additional , costly sleep lab . Findings : We anticipate result Aim 1 demonstrate participant receive in-lab versus home test similar clinical outcome . We anticipate Aim 2 demonstrate home test cost effective in-lab testing . If confirm , finding lead wide acceptance home portable monitor test increase veteran access care .</detailed_description>
