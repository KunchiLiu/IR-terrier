	<brief_summary>In research study investigator look see combination docetaxel plus Vandetanib effective treatment metastatic transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) . Docetaxel chemotherapy drug kill cancer cell divide . It widely use TCC . Vandetanib drug believe stop new blood vessel form around cancer cell . The combination docetaxel Vandetanib study people lung cancer find helpful kill cancer cell . Thus , study look people TCC , see combination docetaxel plus Vandetanib good bad docetaxel alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study Docetaxel +/- Vandetanib Metastatic TCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Because one know study option best , option consider equally likely work , participant randomize one two study group : docetaxel plus Vandetanib docetaxel plus placebo . - Each treatment cycle last three week time participant take Vandetanib placebo day , every day . On Day 1 cycle ( cycle 21 day ) , participant receive docetaxel infusion vein arm one hour . - On Day 1 every cycle follow test procedure perform : physical exam blood test . On day 1 Day 8 first cycle , participant ECG . Every 6-9 week ( every 2 3 cycle ) , participant tumor assessed x-ray , CT scan , bone scan , and/or MRI .</detailed_description>

Patient regimens one allow may include discretion Overall Principal Investigator felt regimen show minimal activity toxicity influence prior subsequent therapy . Specifically , participant must meet one follow criterion : ) Progression treatment regimen include platinum salt ( e.g . carboplatin cisplatin ) Stage IV disease OR b ) Disease recurrence within two year ( date last dose chemotherapy surgery day inform consent sign ) neoadjuvant adjuvant treatment regimen include platinum salt . Measurable evaluable disease , define RECIST . If site measurable evaluable disease irradiate , one site must demonstrate growth irradiation . Adequate contraceptive method subject reproductive potential ( female reproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day study entry ) . ECOG PS 0 1 18 year age old History treatment TCC ( settingneoadjuvant , adjuvant metastatic disease ) docetaxel . Patients treat prior paclitaxel ( Taxol ) eligible . History treatment VEGFaxis active agent , include antibody VEGF , antibodies VEGF receptor , VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Laboratory result outline protocol Evidence uncontrolled systemic disease concurrent condition Investigator 's opinion make undesirable subject participate trial would jeopardize compliance protocol Clinically significant cardiac event myocardial infarction ; NHYA classification heart disease &gt; 2 within three month entry ; presence cardiac disease , opinion Investigator , increase risk ventricular arrhythmia History arrhythmia , bigeminy , trigeminy , ventricular tachycardia , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation symptomatic require treatment ( CTCAE Grade 3 ) asymptomatic sustain ventricular tachycardia . Atrial fibrillation , control medication exclude . Previous history QTc prolongation result medication require discontinuation medication . Congenital long QT syndrome 1st degree relative unexplained sudden death 40 year age . Presence leave bundle branch block ( LBBB ) QTc Bazett 's correction unmeasurable , 480 msec great screen ECG . If subject QTc 480msec great screening ECG , screen ECG may repeat twice ( least 24 hour apart ) . The average QTc three screen ECGs must &lt; 480 msec order subject eligible study . Any concomitant medication may cause QTc prolongation , induce Torsades de Pointes induce CYP3A4 function . Hypertension control medical therapy Currently active diarrhea Women currently pregnant breast feeding Receipt investigational agent , chemotherapy radiation therapy within 21 day prior Study Day 1 Any unresolved nonhematologic toxicity great CTCAE grade 1 previous anticancer therapy ( alopecia ) .
