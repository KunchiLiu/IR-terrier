The recommend dose regimen select base safety , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic profile observe treatment subject solid tumor . This two-part study . Part 1 identify recommend Part 2 dose use dose-escalation procedure . Escalation may proceed either maximum tolerate dose establish , toxicokinetic safety limit reach . The recommended Part 2 dose expand 12 patient . Part 2 explore safety , tolerability , clinical activity GSK2118436 subject BRAF mutation-positive tumor . In addition , effect GSK2118436 midazolam assess subset patient Part 2 . Biologically active dos identify measurement pharmacodynamic marker tumor tissue blood across range dos dos may explore Part 2 .</brief_summary>

The criterion must follow time first dose study medication 16 week last dose study medication . A female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential postmenopausal define protocol . A female childbearing potential may participate agrees use one contraception method list protocol . Adequate organ system function define protocol . Part 2/Cohorts A , B C : Must radiologically and/or clinically documented disease least one measurable lesion define RECIST criterion . Part 2/Cohort C : Must BRAF positive melanoma V600E mutation . Currently receive cancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy , surgery and/or tumor embolization ) . Use investigational anticancer drug within 28 day precede first dose GSK2118436 . Current use prohibit medication define protocol require medication treatment GSK2118436 . Current use therapeutic warfarin . Any major surgery , radiotherapy , immunotherapy within 4 week prior first dose . Limited radiotherapy within 2 week prior first dose . Chemotherapy regimens delay toxicity within four week prior first dose ( 6 week prior nitrosourea mitomycin C ) . Chemotherapy regimens give continuously weekly basis limit potential delayed toxicity within 2 week prior first dose . Unresolved toxicity great National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 3.0 Grade 1 previous anticancer therapy except alopecia unless agree GSK Medical Monitor investigator .
