	<brief_title>Gabapentin Preventing Nausea Vomiting Patients Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate effectiveness gabapentin control delay chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting ( CINV ) patient receive highly emetogenic chemotherapy define percentage complete responder ( emetic episode rescue medication ) day 2 6 ( five day receipt highly emetogenic chemotherapy ) compare effective prophylactic regimen . - To evaluate effectiveness gabapentin control delay CINV patient receive highly emetogenic chemotherapy define percentage complete responder ( emetic episode , mild nausea , rescue medication ) day 2 6 compare effective prophylactic regimen . - To compare effectiveness regimen control acute CINV day 1 treatment patient . - To compare use rescue agent patient . - To determine tolerability gabapentin patient . - To evaluate effect gabapentin delay chemotherapy-induced nausea vomit symptom distress functional ability patient . - To compare alternative endpoint method assess nausea vomit determine measure compare patient 's satisfaction symptom control , distress function . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord gender , age ( &lt; 50 year vs &gt; 50 year ) , history alcoholism ( yes v ) , history motion sickness history pregnancy induce nausea/vomiting ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral dexamethasone 5HT3 receptor antagonist oral gabapentin daily day 1 chemotherapy . Patients receive oral dexamethasone twice daily without 5HT3 receptor antagonist day 2-4 , oral gabapentin either two three time daily day 2-5 chemotherapy . - Arm II : Patients receive oral dexamethasone 5HT3 receptor antagonist oral placebo daily day 1 chemotherapy . Patients receive oral dexamethasone twice daily without 5HT3 receptor antagonist day 2-4 , oral placebo either two three time daily day 2-5 chemotherapy . Patients complete Functional Living Index - Emesis questionnaire , overall satisfaction survey , side effect experience diary baseline day 6 . Patients also complete nausea vomit diary baseline periodically study therapy .</detailed_description>
