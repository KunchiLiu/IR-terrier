	<brief_summary>The current study investigates effect two potential alcohol treatment medication drink laboratory setting . Aripiprazole ( APZ ) , effect dopamine serotonin receptor fewer limit side effect see atypical antipsychotic . Topiramate ( TPMT ) , antiepileptic , affect glutamate GABA-A receptor show promise reduce heavy drinking . Few study use two medication diverse combination action examine potential synergistic effect reduce alcohol consumption . The primary aim : 1. determine APZ TPMT effective placebo , combination APZ TPMT effective either drug alone placebo , reduce alcohol use non-treatment seek alcohol dependent subject laboratory base alcohol self-administration experiment ( ASAE ) 2. examine hypothesize dose-response three dos APZ ( 0 , 7.5 mg/d 15 mg/d ) along three dos TPMT ( 0 , 100mg/d 200mg/d ) 3. examine putative mechanism action APZ , TPMT alone together crave , subjective stimulation , candidate gene influence behavioral effect associate alcohol consumption 4. establish safety give APZ TPMT together . Non-treatment seek , alcohol dependent Participants ( N=216 ) recruit community randomly assign one 9 cell . Subjects drink safety monitor 5-week titration target dose , lead in-laboratory alcohol self administration session , clinical behavioral effect assess access alcohol . A 1 month follow-up ass adverse event drinking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Due modest effect current pharmacotherapies , effective treatment must develop optimally treat alcohol dependent patient . Treatments combine pharmacotherapies different mechanism action may better address diverse neurobiology alcohol heterogeneity alcoholic . However , little known medication may affect behavior reduce drinking . Aripiprazole ( APZ ) , partial dopamine agonist , affect dopamine serotonin receptor without limit side effect see atypical antipsychotic . Dopamine mediate reward base drinking crave . Topiramate ( TPMT ) , antiepileptic , affect glutamate GABA-A receptor show promise reduce heavy drinking . Glutamate GABA may mediate relief-based drinking protract withdrawal . Despite strong evidence multiple neurotransmitter contribute alcoholism , study use two medication diverse combination action examine potential synergistic effect reduce alcohol consumption . The present study recruit 216 healthy , alcohol-dependent volunteer currently seek treatment alcohol dependence learn medication may work . The primary aim : ( 1 ) determine APZ TPMT effective placebo , combination APZ TPMT effective either drug alone placebo , reduce alcohol use non-treatment seek alcohol dependent subject alcohol self administration experiment ( ASAE ) ; ( 2 ) examine hypothesize dose-response three dos APZ ( 0 , 7.5mg/d 15 mg/d ) three dos TPMT ( 0 , 100mg/d , 200mg/d ) ; ( 3 ) examine putative mechanism action APZ , TPMT alone together crave , subjective stimulation , candidate gene influence behavioral effect associate alcohol consumption ; ( 4 ) establish safety give APZ TPMT together . We use 3 X 3 drug ( 7.5mg , 15mg APZ vs. placebo ) drug ( 100mg , 200mg TPMT vs. placebo ) between-subjects factorial design . Participants randomly assign one 9 cell . Subjects drink safety monitor 5-week titration target dose , lead in-laboratory alcohol self administration session , clinical behavioral effect assess access alcohol . A 1 month follow-up ass adverse event drink . The long term objective research improve medication available alcoholism treatment inform research theory mechanisms action medication .</detailed_description>
