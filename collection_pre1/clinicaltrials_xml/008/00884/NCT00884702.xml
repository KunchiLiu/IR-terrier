	<brief_summary>Background : - The brain need sleep function normally , purpose sleep understood . Brain activity decrease sleep , may sleep important maintain , repair , reorganize brain cell . In animal , formation brain proteins increase sleep , thing may happen human . - There also evidence learn memory help sleep , synthesis protein brain involve . Objectives : - To examine formation protein brain people awake , deprived sleep , sleep . - To look formation protein brain awake asleep follow learn task . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 28 year age . - Volunteers must psychiatric , neurologic , sleep disorder certain type vision problem , must able undergo image study . Design : - Study Part I ( protein formation waking , sleep deprivation , sleep ) : - Participants wear actigraph ( unit record motor activity ) 2 week prior admission . - Participants physical psychological examination , along blood sample . - After admission participant three positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan study protein formation one magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan course two day . - Participants may ask stay awake long 20 hour monitor throughout . - Participants able sleep overnight complete require scan monitoring , discharge follow morning . - Study Part II ( protein formation wake sleep combine learn task ) : - Participants wear actigraph ( unit record motor activity ) 2 week prior admission . - Participants physical psychological examination , along blood sample . - After admission participant may ask stay awake long 20 hour monitor throughout . - The next morning , participant train perform computerized visual discrimination task , test 8 hour later ( sleep remain awake ) visual discrimination task . - Some participant may PET MRI scan part study . - Participants able sleep overnight complete require test scan , discharge follow morning . - Participants receive financial compensation participation study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Rates Cerebral Protein Synthesis : Effects Sleep Memory Consolidation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The importance sleep widely appreciate , actual function sleep remain unknown . Sleep occurs much animal kingdom , mammal bird even low form . Sleep deprivation impairs brain function , rat , total sleep deprivation 2-3 week result death . One hypothesized role sleep restoration reorganization neuronal circuit . There indirect evidence sleep , cerebral energy requirement reduce , cell resource divert protein synthesis restoration structure function . The objective present study : 1 ) define relationship regional rate cerebral protein synthesis ( rCPS ) sleep 2 ) ascertain whether sleep-dependent visual learning slow wave sleep ( SWS ) result increase rCPS primary visual cortex . We propose use novel positron emission tomography ( PET ) -based technique quantify regional rate cerebral protein synthesis ( rCPS ) young , adult , healthy volunteer . The first objective address Part I study subject follow three condition : 1 ) awake sleep-sated , 2 ) awake sleep-deprived , 3 ) SWS sleep-deprivation . Our aim complete fully successful study 15 subject . The second objective address Part II ass relationship rCPS sleep-dependent visual learning retinotopically specific task . Each participant serve control compare trained primary visual cortex hemisphere untrained hemisphere comparable visual information present without learn . In Part II study two group subject : 1 ) One group study SWS follow training session ; 2 ) The second group study interval follow training session awake . Subjects monitor polysomnography identify stage sleep . Our aim part II complete fully successful study 15 subject two group . We anticipate result Part I identify change rCPS specific brain region characteristic SWS result Part II may reveal relationship rCPS memory consolidation SWS .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy male female volunteer present past diagnosis neurologic , medical psychiatric condition may confound either learn trail , normal sleep pattern ability undergo sleep deprivation . Healthy male female subject , 1828 year age , meet exclusion criterion , selfreported normal sleep pattern ( i.e. , 69 h per night ) major sleep disruption four week prior evaluation consider inclusion study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA INCLUDE A HISTORY OF , OR CURRENT : 1. chronic medical condition contraindication PET MRI scanning , 2. past present diagnosis psychiatric condition ( DSMIV criterion ) ( many condition ( e.g . depression ) , may confound performance learn trail associate baseline sleep abnormality ) , 3. chronic/degenerative/acquired neurologic disorder , ( 4 ) family history genetically transmissible neurologic disorder , ( 5 ) sleep disorder medical condition associate chronically disorder sleep may confound performance learn trail interfere sleep requirement study , ( 6 ) visual impairment may confound performance learning trail , ( 7 ) claustrophobic subject , ( 8 ) subject meet inclusion criterion , unable cooperate requirement study ( e.g . refusal wear actigraphs maintain 10 hour time bed , report difficulty sleep away home back ) . ( 9 ) Subjects chronic indicate nonindicated use medication interfere sleep architecture and/or learn trail exclude . Generally , prohibit use medications/agents ( e.g . antihistamine , benadryl , melatonin , cigarette , chocolate , coffee , tea , caffeine drink etc . ) , significant CNS penetration , alert , and/or disrupt physiologic sleepwake cycle sleep architecture , 72 hr immediately precede presentation study . To acclimatize subject , encourage patient discontinue minimize use agents/medications ( e.g . le equal 1 cup coffee/day ) time initial screening ( time actigraphy application , approximately 2 wks prior study ) . Similarly , ask subject minimize alcohol use 2 wks prior study discontinue alcohol use 72 hr immediately precede study . ( 10 ) Subjects use illicit drug ( marijuana , cocaine , heroin , etc . ) within immediate 2 wks precede study . ( 11 ) Female subject exclude either clinical history suspicious , laboratory evaluation consistent pregnancy . ( 12 ) Subjects unwilling undergo HIV testing , unless enrol Part IIa study . ( 13 ) Subjects test HIV positive . ( 14 ) Patients para and/or ferromagnetic prosthesis/implants/fragments body exclude study .</criteria>
