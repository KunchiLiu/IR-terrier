	<brief_summary>The purpose study standardize meal test facilitate future study postprandial glucagons-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) response Chinese subject . Eighteen healthy Chinese subject , age 20-65 year old , without history diabetes , recruit study . Each subject receive two mixed meal test postprandial GLP-1 excursion random order : 60 % carbohydrate ( CHO ) /20 % fat vs. 50 % CHO/30 % fat . The postprandial glucose , insulin , glucagon relate hormone response also measure . Through study , hope build platform study postprandial GLP-1 response insulin secretion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Response Challenge Mixed Meals Chinese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) 30-amino acid peptide produce intestinal epithelial endocrine L-cells . It stimulate insulin suppresses glucagon secretion , inhibit gastric emptying , reduce appetite food intake . In fast state , plasma concentration GLP-1 low . Levels circulate GLP-1 rise rapidly food intake . The GLP-1 meal response depend ingested nutrient . Carbohydrates strong stimuli GLP-1 release . Protein stimulate GLP-1 release , even carbohydrates . GLP-1 concentration also increase intake fat , although elevation delay compare stimulation carbohydrate . Dietary fiber may also modify postprandial GLP-1 response . Therefore , essential u characterize nutrient composition test meal study meal response GLP-1 . Other sample condition meal test also need take care . GLP-1 rapidly degrade enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV ( DPP-4 ) . During meal test , important add enzyme inhibitor sample tube avoid hormone degradation . Lugari et al . collect blood sample tube contain EDTA aprotinin meal test . They could obtain sample tube glucagon GLP-1 assay . Other study group report sample GLP-1 need collected Vacutainer tube prepare EDTA DPP-4 inhibitor prevent degradation GLP-1 . Another aim present study compare difference GLP-1 concentration sample collect EDTA tube contain aprotinin DPP-4 inhibitor meal test . Racial difference GLP-1 level oral glucose challenge demonstrate recently severely obese African Americans exhibit low GLP-1 concentration Caucasians . It worthwhile examine meal response GLP-1 across ethnicity . The current study proposes observe GLP-1 response standardize meal test group Chinese subject . The purpose study standardize meal test facilitate future study postprandial GLP-1 response Chinese subject . Eighteen healthy Chinese subject , age 20-65 year old , without history diabetes , recruit study . Each subject receive two mixed meal test postprandial GLP-1 excursion random order : 60 % carbohydrate ( CHO ) /20 % fat vs. 50 % CHO/30 % fat . The postprandial glucose , insulin , glucagon relate hormone response also measure . Through study , hope build platform study postprandial GLP-1 response insulin secretion .</detailed_description>
