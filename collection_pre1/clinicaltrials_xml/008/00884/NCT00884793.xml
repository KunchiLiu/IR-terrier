	<brief_summary>The `` PLUS '' study pilot study measure effect therapy intensification ( raltegravir optional second agent ) HIV level gut blood patient antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL ( herein refer `` suppress '' ) . We hypothesize ongoing replication gut despite suppressive ART replication inhibit addition one two new antiretroviral drug whose activity affect distinct part viral life cycle . All study participant upper low endoscopy baseline ( intensification ) intensification . These endoscopy use obtain gut tissue single cell ( CD4+ cell ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The `` PLUS '' study prospective , longitudinal pilot study measure effect therapy intensification ( raltegravir possible addition study PI NNRTI-Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor ) HIV-1 DNA/RNA level gut-associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) blood patient ART viral load ( VL ) &lt; 50 copies/mL ( herein refer `` suppress '' ) . We hypothesize ongoing replication GALT despite suppressive ART replication inhibit addition one two new antiretroviral drug whose activity affect distinct part viral life cycle . All study participant colonoscopy esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) baseline ( intensification ) second colonoscopy EGD 12 week intensification . These endoscopy use obtain GALT mononuclear cell ( CD4+ lymphocytes ) well tissue situ hybridization immunohistochemical study .</detailed_description>
