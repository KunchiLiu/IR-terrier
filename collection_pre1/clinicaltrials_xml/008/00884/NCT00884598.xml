	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Cilengitide may stop growth brain metastasis block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high energy X-rays kill tumor cell . Giving cilengitide together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose cilengitide give together whole-brain radiation therapy treat patient brain metastasis lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Primary - To assess safety tolerability daily cilengitide determine dose-limiting toxicity maximum-tolerated dose combine concomitant fractionate whole-brain radiation therapy patient brain metastasis lung cancer . - Secondary - To collect evidence best overall response rate , overall survival , brain-specific progression-free survival , tumor-specific progression-free survival patient . - To collect evidence change functional MRI image study 6 12 week initiation therapy . - To collect evidence early response functional MRI ( ASL technique ) day 1 , 4 , 12 , immediately administration cilengitide . - To collect evidence change neurological neurocognitive function test 6 12 week initiation therapy . - To evaluate safety toxicity combination cilengitide whole-brain radiation therapy . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics cilengitide administer daily . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral cilengitide daily undergo whole-brain radiotherapy day . Treatment continue 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection day 1 , 4 , 5 , 12 pharmacokinetic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 10 week .</detailed_description>
