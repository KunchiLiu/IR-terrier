	<detailed_description>[ F-18 ] VM4-037 develop diagnostic radiopharmaceutical PET imaging . SMI seek determine [ F-18 ] VM4-037 might useful PET ligand vivo image CA-IX level human tissue . CA-IX active enzyme may acidify extracellular microenvironment tumor cell response hypoxia . Its expression usually promote tumor growth invasion , thus impairs prognosis . VM4-037 present know risk either vitro study cell line vivo study animal accord in-house preclinical investigation compound . The population study consist total approximately sixteen ( 16 ) adult subject , include four normal , healthy volunteer twelve cancer subject confirm highly suspect diagnosis head neck cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , large solitary hepatic carcinoma , renal cell carcinoma define protocol criterion . This initial trial Exploratory , Phase 0 study design evaluate biodistribution , collect baseline tumor/background image data , gather preliminary safety data investigational product . The study result analyze consider design future clinical trial . The primary objective exploratory study : - To gain information bio-distribution [ F-18 ] VM4-037 , evaluate PET image [ F-18 ] VM4-037 resolution signal background ratio tumor , determine CA-IX expression tumor tissue CA-IX antibody immunohistochemistry - To collect safety data , use eIND order obtain necessary information file IND ( Investigational New Drug ) application FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) The secondary objective exploratory study : - To begin collection baseline image metabolism data - To gain information improve study design conduct future trials The trial expect begin subject enrolment approximately April , 2009 end subject participation approximately September , 2009 , depend rate enrollment . The subject expect attend three visit , add several hour . The Investigational Product ( IP ) test study [ F-18 ] VM4-037 . The [ F-18 ] VM4-037 administer qualified subject via bolus intravenous ( IV ) injection . For normal volunteer , dose exceed 20 mCi , image time dosimetry minimum four hour . For cancer subject , dose close 10 mCi ( total imaging time cancer subject 2 hour ) . The procedure study include follow : Obtain Informed Consent , Assign Study Subject Number , Obtain Medical History , Perform Eligibility Blood Labs , Take Pre-Dose Blood Sample CA-IX Test , Perform Pre-Dose ECG , Monitor Collect Adverse Events , Collect Concomitant Medications , Perform Pre-Dose Physical Exam , Perform Pre-Dose ECG , Insert IV Line , Take Pre-Dose CBC Chemistry Blood Labs , Take Pre-Dose Blood Sample Metabolite Analysis ( applicable ) , Take Pregnancy Test ( applicable ) , Take Pre-Dose Vital Signs , Prepare Administer IP , Perform [ F-18 ] VM4-037 PET Imaging , Take Post-Dose Blood Samples Metabolite Analysis ( applicable ) , Take Post-Dose Vital Signs , Perform Post-dose ECGs , Collect Urine Sample Count Dosimetry ( normal ) , Monitor Adverse Events , Collect Concomitant Medications , Perform Physical Exam 24 hr Post-Dose , Take Blood Sample CBC Chemistry Labs 24 hr Post-Dose , Perform ECG 24 hr Post-Dose , Take Vital Signs 24 hr Post-Dose , Monitor Collect Adverse Events , Collect Concomitant Medications , [ F-18 ] FDG PET Imaging , Immunohistochemistry</detailed_description>
