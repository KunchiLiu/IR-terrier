	<detailed_description>Secondary Hypothesis study compare impact intervention treatment usual patient ' satisfaction care , resolution interpersonal family problem attribution fully understand mechanism action intervention . Background Significance : Most economically developed nation multi-ethnic . If current demographic trend continue society become ethnically diverse . UK census reveal proportion UK population belong non-white minority ethnic group increase 53 % 1991 2001 , 3 million 4.6 million ( 7.9 % UK population ) . Half total ethnic minority population south Asian family origin ( UK census 2001 ) . Suicide , self-directed violence , global public health problem . According recent report World Health Organization , world wide , suicide claim life estimate 815,000 people year 2000 , age-adjusted rate 14.5 per 100,000 ( WHO , 2002 ) . In United Kingdom , suicide second common cause death people age 15-24 ( Hawton et al , 1998 ) . Prevention suicide include health policy initiatives several country reduction suicidal behavior , fatal non-fatal , part Health All target World Health Organization ( WHO , 1992 ) . Prevention suicide also priority health service England ( Department health , 1999a , b , 2002 ) . Deliberate self-poisoning one commonest reason medical admission United Kingdom . ( NHS Centre R &amp; D 1998 ) major public health problem 170,000 hospital attendance per annum ( Kapur et al , 1998 ) . Health significance attempt suicide underlined link suicide . Of patient present hospital deliberate self-harm , 15 % eventually kill . ( Nordentoft et al , 1993 ) . It estimate year follow suicide attempt , risk repeat attempt death suicide may 100 time great see people never attempt suicide ( Garland &amp; Zigler , 1993 ) Among ethnic minority group UK report high rate suicide Asian woman ( Soni Raleigh et al , 1990 ; 1992 ; Neelman et al , 1996 ; Patel &amp; Gaw , 1996 ) . Previous study United Kingdom also suggest rate self-harm young Asian woman higher white population ( Burke , 1976 ; Merrill &amp; Owens , 1986 ; Glover et al , 1989 , Husain et al , 2006 ) . Recent hospital data London indicate self harm 2.5 time frequent among young Asian woman ( 16-30 year ) white woman age 62 % former express regret survive compare 36 % white woman ( Bhugra et al , 1999 ) . There concern acceptability current service ethnic minority patient ( Parkman et al , 1997 ; Goater et al , 1999 ; Sashidharan , 2001 ) . The high rate suicide young woman South Asian origin UK may relate untreat self-harm . Of known risk factor suicide , strongly predictive future suicide attempt complete suicide hopelessness prior history self harm ( Brown et al , 2000 ) . In Manchester ( MASH project ) use data collect Emergency department four year period find high rate self harm South Asian white European female ( relative risk 1.5 time 16-24 year age group ) . Interpersonal conflict within family main precipitating factor , significantly frequent white female . In spite difference clinical presentation suicidal intent significant difference Emergency department ' management two group . Referral back primary care common management plan South Asians European white refer psychiatric service management ( Cooper et al , 2006 ) . It extremely important effective treatment deliberate self-harm patient widely utilized clinical practice identify ( Arsensman et al , 2001 ) . We aware intervention trial ethnic minority UK . As population become increasingly diverse , tailor practice area 's demographic crucial provide effective treatment . For mental health provider area large black minority ethnic population , essential provide culturally acceptable service . The National Service Framework ( NSF ) Mental Health UK ( DoH , 1999 ) reaffirm issue inappropriate service black ethnic minority community . Standard one NSF require work individual community disparity combat . The mental health service work social exclusion , especially regards people black minority group . The standard seven NSF focus reduction rate suicide . The NICE ( National Institute Clinical Excellence ) guideline also make recommendation culturally sensitive service suggest NHS Trusts must identify board member take responsibility diversity ethnic issue . Responsibilities must include adequacy service provision , train cultural difference , monitor service usage ethnicity , consultation local black minority ethnic group achieve target set advance year year basis . The low uptake statutory service within South Asian community UK call question appropriateness exist service . There need move away stereotypes overgeneralizations start user 's frame reference , take account family dynamic , belief system cultural constraint . This indicate urgent need concern mental health service ethnic minority take positive action eradicate barrier . The Case Action Inside Outside ( DOH , 2003 ) highlight significantly raise risk suicide attempt suicide among young Asian woman UK . Cutting suicide rate 20 % 2010 key national mental health target . Catering needs high-risk group vital component meeting target . Under representation ethnic minority mental health research : Despite evidence relationship ethnicity increase risk mental disorder , little known provide mental health service group . ( Waheed et al , 2003 ) . A new research agenda need drive development evaluation culturally sensitive appropriate psychosocial intervention ethnic minority group . Not study effectiveness intervention efficiency delivery system well priorities special population . ( Miranda et al , 2003 ) UK clinical trial cater need ethnic minority ( Mason 2003 ) , unlike USA National Institute health ( NIH ) fund research sensitive specific need ( Sheikh 2004 ) . This compromise generalisability external validity . We carry systematic review find study provide information outcome mental health care ethnic minority . In UK date one RCT educational intervention depression report ( Jacob 2002 ) . This reporting mainly due under-representation ethnic minority health research concern . In fact contrary prevalent investment great resource effort direct toward research section society great capacity benefit research ( i.e . high risk and/or currently access receive appropriate care ) . ( Sheikh 2006 ) High prevalence suicidal ideation depression among woman South Asian origin : In previous study primary care ( Husain et 1997 ) MRC fund population-based project ( Gater et al ( 2008 ) ) concern mental health need people Pakistani family origin demonstrate woman Pakistani origin live north west England high rate psychological distress depression , 13.8 % Pakistani woman community base sample 475 woman report suicidal ideation Self Reporting Questionnaire ( SRQ ) . This associate increase psychological distress ( mean SRQ score 12.3 participant suicidal idea compare 5.23 report suicidal thought ) . This presumably reflect hopelessness South Asian woman UK . Socio cultural determinant deliberate self harm woman South Asian origin : Primary care hospital base research UK demonstrate socio cultural determinant cultural synchronization woman South Asian origin culture family origin characteristically realms overprotective home environment , differences social norm , interpersonal conflict family , issue around personal choice like relationship marriage main precipitating factor ( Hicks &amp; Bhugra 2003 ) . Compared match GP attender , self harm , Asian self-harm group significantly less favour arrange marriage likely experience severe life event close relationship ( Bhugra et al , 1999b ) . It show young woman restrain religion involve self-harm compare old woman . ( Glover et al 1989 ) . In survey London 180 woman report top three cause suicide attempt Asian woman 'violence husband ' ( 92 % ) , 'being trap unhappy family situation ' ( 90 % ) , 'depression ' ( 90 % ) ( Bhugra 2004 ) . Failure access care determinant chronic distress : The high rate suicide young woman South Asian origin ( Raleigh VS , 1996 ) may relate untreated self harm . A previous qualitative study show young South Asian woman tend access care point desperation rather crisis reach ( Chew-Graham et al 2002 ) . There appear reluctance seek early help thus prolong course distress , may explain cultural attitude mental disorder . Among South Asians , woman less likely seek help ( Fenton &amp; Sadiq ; 1993 ) . Furthermore psychologically distress Asian patient consult GP likely present physical problem white counterpart , less likely distress identify white counterpart ( Wilson &amp; MacCarthy1994 ) . The literature suggest service fail engage ethnic minority ( Beliappa , 1991 ; Newham Project , 1998 ; Chew-Graham et al , 2001 ) . Language problem may barrier access appropriate treatment , although likely young South Asian woman self harmed second third generation would fluent English . Low intensity treatment and/or adverse experience service may prevent South Asians present hospital follow subsequent self-harm episode . A high proportion South Asians ( particularly woman ) cite interpersonal problem family member main precipitant self-harm episode study Manchester ( Cooper et al , 2006 ) . The psychosocial stressor precipitate self-harm South Asian woman may culturally influence , exclude psychological help . Both problem solve therapy ( Salkovskis PM et al , 1990 ; Hawton et al , 1998 ) interpersonal form psychotherapy ( Guthrie E et al , 1998 ) benefit treatment patient self-harm , could potentially help group . However , work adapt either approach , specifically cater need South Asian woman , require . A recent systematic review self harm conclude treatment show promise , randomise intervention trial require ( Hawton K et al , 1998 ) . Since episodes deliberate self-harm South Asian woman precipitate interpersonal problem family member strong rationale investigate efficacy intervention , address issue . Problem solve therapy sound theoretical basis . Consistent evidence show people attempt suicide poor problem solve skill ( Linehan , Camper , Chiles et al , 1987 , Schotte &amp; Clum , 1987 ; McLeavey , Day , Murray et al , 1987 ; Pollock &amp; Williams , 2001 ) . It hypothesize problem-solving deficit contribute hopelessness depression , turn increase probability suicidal ideation intent ( Schotte &amp; Clum , 1987 ; D'Zurilla et al , 1998 ) . Problem solve therapy find effective reducing level depression hopelessness patient attempt suicide ( Townsend et al , 2001 ) . In addition , problem-solving therapy brief , cost effective , pragmatic intervention potential widely utilized clinical practice . Thus , problem solve deficit see suicidal individual indicate systematic training problem solve skill focus problem precipitate suicide attempt likely positive effect predictor suicidality repetition suicidal behavior . Thus strong rationale exists pilot study problem solve therapy order clearly determine acceptability intervention follow self harm South Asian population .</detailed_description>
