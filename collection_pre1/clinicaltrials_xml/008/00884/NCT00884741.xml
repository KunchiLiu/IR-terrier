	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study temozolomide ( TMZ ) radiation therapy ( RT ) compare well work without bevacizumab treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma gliosarcoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may find tumor cell help kill . It yet know whether temozolomide radiation therapy effective give together without bevacizumab treat glioblastoma gliosarcoma .</brief_summary>

To assess association change lesion size T1 T3 , measure advanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , overall progression-free survival . ( ACRIN 6686 ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine differential acute effect associate addition bevacizumab temozolomide radiation , compare conventional arm , measure neurocognitive function , health-related quality life , symptom radiation across longitudinal progression-free interval . II . To determine relationship neurocognitive function , health-related quality life , symptom , progression-free overall survival . III . To determine association tumor molecular profile ( i.e. , mesenchymal/angiogenic phenotype proneural phenotype ) neurocognitive function , health-related quality life , symptom . IV . To describe association health-related quality life measure European Organization Research Treatment Quality Life Questionnaire-Core 30/Brain Cancer Module-20 ( EORTC-QL30/BCM20 ) mean symptom severity measure M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor Module ( MDASI-BT ) patient enrol study . V. To evaluate relationship self-reported neurocognitive function objectively measure test neurocognitive function ( NCF ) . VI . To assess association measure change enhance tumor size week 22 overall survival participant glioma receive chemoradiotherapy without bevacizumab . VII . To assess association measure change T2-based tumor size week 22 overall survival participant glioma receive chemoradiotherapy without bevacizumab . VIII . To assess association change ADC value overall survival participant glioma receive chemoradiotherapy without bevacizumab . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( also two registration step prior randomization label `` arm '' ClinicalTrials.gov facilitate entry result website ) . ARM I : Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy 5 day week 6 week receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 7 week . Beginning 4 week completion chemotherapy radiation therapy , patient receive temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Treatment temozolomide repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive placebo IV 30-90 minute every 2 week begin week 4 chemotherapy radiation therapy continue completion temozolomide . ARM II : Patients undergo radiation therapy receive temozolomide Arm I . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 2 week begin week 4 chemoradiotherapy continue completion adjuvant temozolomide . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
