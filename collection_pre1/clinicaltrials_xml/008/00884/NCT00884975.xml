Previous study suggest patient experienced frequent exacerbation present bad HRQoL compare patient infrequent exacerbation . However , still question regard relationship HRQoL exacerbation . In present study investigator study cohort COPD patient 6 year , document exacerbation , ass lung emphysema compute tomography chest evaluate health relate quality life COPD patient .

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) characterize progressive loss lung function recurrent exacerbation . COPD exacerbation major cause physician visit hospital admission associate acute respiratory failure , cause increase morbidity premature mortality thus significantly affect HRQoL . Previous study suggest patient experienced frequent exacerbation present bad HRQoL compare patient infrequent exacerbation . However , still question regard relationship HRQoL exacerbation . Only study integral part clinical trial investigate relationship exacerbation long-term impairment HRQoL . Furthermore , recent study fail show exacerbation remain significant determinant HRQoL several prognostic factor take account . In addition , luck data regard difference HRQoL patient different phenotype ( i.e. , emphysema chronic bronchitis predominance ) . In respect prospectively study long term effect exacerbation quality life patient COPD aim investigate relationship exacerbation HRQoL . The investigator hypothesize extend emphysema positively correlate worsen Health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) . Consecutive sampling use recruit patient diagnosis COPD accord GOLD definition.Exacerbations identify worsen patient 's respiratory sign record diary card . HQoL assess use Saint George Respiratory Questionaire ( SGRQ ) . Patients undergo high resolution compute tomography chest ( HRCT ) . Multiple linear regression analysis use identify factor explain SGRQ deterioration study period entire population smoker ex-smokers separately .</detailed_description>
