	<detailed_description>Context : Whether performance cardiopulmonary resuscitation positively influence teach leadership short debriefing remain largely unknown Objective : To test hypothesis ( 1 ) leadership instruction effective ( 2 ) improve leadership result well performance high fidelity simulate cardiopulmonary resuscitation . Design : Prospective , randomized-controlled superiority trial Setting : Simulator Center University Hospital Basel Switzerland Patients Other Participants : 237 volunteer medical student team 3 Intervention : During baseline visit , medical student participate video-taped simulate witnessed cardiac arrest . Participants randomize receive thereafter short video-assisted debrief focus either correct position arm shoulder ( technical debriefing ) leadership communication enhance team coordination ( leadership debrief ) . A follow-up simulation conduct 4 month . Leadership utterance , technical skill resuscitation performance team compare base videotape cod two independent researcher . Main Outcome Measures : The primary outcome study amount hands-on time first 180 second onset cardiac arrest time elapse cardiopulmonary resuscitation start . Secondary endpoint effectiveness technical leadership instruction , respectively .</detailed_description>
