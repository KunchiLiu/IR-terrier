	<brief_title>Evaluation PillCam™ Colon Capsule -2 System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard evaluation subject suspect colon disease include endoscopic image colonoscopy radiology test : air-contrast barium enema , abdominal/pelvic CT , virtual colonoscopy . The Given® Diagnostic System offer alternative approach endoscopic visualization colon . Advantages Given® Diagnostic System include elimination need conscious sedation , minimally invasive , painless nature exam , ability pursue normal daily activity immediately follow procedure . Furthermore , compare standard colonoscopy , Given® Diagnostic System may readily accept subject , thereby improve subject ' willingness undergo diagnostic evaluation colon comply colorectal cancer screen recommendation . The PillCam™ SB capsule ( formerly M2A® Capsule ) clear FDA- August 2001 small bowel evaluation ingest date 500,000 people worldwide well accepted patient physician well professional society . However , adequate visualization colon achieve standard PillCam™ SB capsule anatomical physiological property colon significantly different small bowel . Moreover , issue limit evaluation colonic mucosa standard PillCam™ SB procedure include unsatisfactory level colon cleanliness slow progression PillCam™ SB capsule colon desire examination time . Therefore , development introduction specially design , customize colon capsule combine dedicated capsule colonoscopy procedure protocol allow efficient evaluation colonic mucosa . This expect improve capability Given® Diagnostic System detect colonic pathology serve diagnostic screening tool colonic disease . To date , several clinical study conduct PillCam™ Colon Endoscope 1 ( PCCE-1 ) system . The new development PillCam Colon Endoscope 2 ( PCCE-2 ) primarily aim increase sensitivity specificity polyp detection . Further detail PillCam™ Colon Capsule Endoscope ( PCCE-2 ) find device description section . This study design evaluate performance new version colon capsule performance detect lesion colon compare conventional colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
