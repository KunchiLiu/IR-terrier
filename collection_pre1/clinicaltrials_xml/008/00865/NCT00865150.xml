	<brief_summary>Primary Hypotheses study include : - Metabolic profile influence gestational age , chronological age , type degree nutritional support illness - Metabolic profile differ neonate receive commercial formula neonate receive primarily human breast milk - Neonates develop parenteral associate cholestasis metabolic marker identify risk patient ( high serum urea nitrogen , citrulline , histidine , methionine , succinyl carnitine low thyroxine , serine glutamate ) - Neonates hypothyroidism abnormal metabolic profile ( low tyrosine level )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malnutrition common problem neonatal intensive care unit . Recent study indicate prematurely bear neonate commonly develop severe nutritional deficit first week birth , refer extrauterine growth restriction . Despite increase growth second month hospitalization , many neonate ultimately discharge home grown inadequately . The early nutritional deficit affect weight gain well growth length head circumference . Aggressive administration parenteral amino acid improve protein accretion rate preterm neonate support literature . Although tolerance high dose amino acid describe , researcher acknowledge sensitive test monitor amino acid toxicity readily available clinical setting . The goal study : - To good define normal amino acid acylcarnitine value change premature neonates - To measure effect nutritional support ( human breastmilk vs. formula ) amino acid acylcarnitines profile - To measure effect illness ( parenteral nutrition associate cholestasis ) amino acid acylcarnitine profile - To good define abnormal metabolic profile ( low tyrosine level ) neonates hypothyroidism .</detailed_description>
