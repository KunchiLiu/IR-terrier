	<detailed_description>Promising therapy chronic low back pain yoga need study conventional treatment medication , physical therapy , surgery frequently provide last relief . We use standardized yoga protocol , develop specifically trial consensus panel yoga expert , pilot randomize control trial subject chronic low back pain . We recruit 30 predominantly English-speaking minority adult Boston Medical Center ( BMC ) affiliate clinic low back pain lasting &gt; 12 week average pain level previous week 4 scale 0 10 ( 0 = pain , 10 = worst possible pain ) . Subjects randomize yoga class per week 12 week ( Group 1 ) wait-list control group ( Group 2 ) . All subject receive usual medical care educational booklet design low back pain patient . Primary outcomes 12 week pain intensity functional status measure Roland Morris Disability scale . Secondary outcome include analgesic use , health-related quality life ( SF-36 ) , global improvement , subject satisfaction , adverse event , compliance , work status , health expenditure . Group 2 offer yoga class 26 week . To refine estimate effect size confirm safety protocol , also collect data Group 2 yoga class . This pilot provide preliminary feasibility efficacy data plan future adequately power randomize control trial yoga chronic low back pain predominantly minority subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . 1864 year old . The rationale include adult le 65 year old cause low back pain older person likely multifactorial ( e.g. , degenerative disk disease , spinal canal stenosis , fracture ) less likely nonspecific muscular type yoga protocol design address . A study yoga low back pain individual &gt; 65 year old important . However , ideal design would likely benefit yoga protocol specifically design purpose . 2 . Current nonspecific low back pain lasting least 12 week . Nonspecific refer predominantly muscular ligamentous cause low back pain , absence clear symptom sign cause low back pain ( e.g. , herniated disk ) . This ascertained eligibility screen process use Eligibility Screening Instrument ( see Sect . S ) . This instrument adapt eligibility screening tool use multiple publish trial CAM therapy chronic low back pain Karen Sherman PhD Daniel Cherkin PhD . The instrument use subject selfreport exclude specific cause chronic low back pain exclusion criterion study . 3 . Average pain intensity week prior enrollment 4 great 0 10 numerical pain scale ( 0=no pain , 10=worst possible pain ) . 4 . Compliant fill 2 week daily pain score dairy eligibility screening process . 5 . Ability comprehend , read , write English level necessary understand yoga class instruction complete data collection form . Given first pilot yoga protocol first trial yoga low back pain predominantly minority adult BMC affiliate clinic , decide enhance feasibility focus English speaker first . Our goal ultimately study offer intervention languages commonly spoken BMC patient ( e.g. , Spanish ) . We fully anticipate trial provide necessary experience return IRB near future proposal pilot trial Spanish speaker chronic low back pain . 6 . Individuals sufficient English language ability ethnic group enroll . However , since pilot study specifically target minority chronic low back pain , purposefully allocate 80 % ( 24 30 ) opening study minority subject ( ascertained selfreport ) . 7 .

Ongoing plan litigation relate back pain . Ongoing plan worker ' compensation , disability , personal injury claim relate back pain . Litigation claim resolve settled exclusion criterion . 8 . Back pain selfreport due specific nonmuscular pathology ( e.g. , infection , malignancy , fracture ) ; severe progressive neurological deficit ; active substance alcohol abuse ; serious underlie systemic comorbid disease preclude physical cognitive ability perform yoga protocol ( see Inclusion Criteria # 2 ) . 9 . Suicidal thought detect eligibility interview . Those report suicidal thought immediately refer PCP and/or BMC Department Psychiatry . 10 . Lack consent participate .</criteria>
