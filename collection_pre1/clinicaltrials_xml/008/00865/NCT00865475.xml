	<brief_title>Prevention Lipoatrophy Patients Treated With Lopinavir/Ritonavir Monotherapy Versus ZDV + 3TC + ABC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year mayor progress make therapeutic approach introduction HAART , mean huge fall morbidity-mortality Western country . However , despite variety potent HAART combination , patient obtain adequate suppression . The cause virological failure complex , one significant factor incomplete compliance prescribe dosage highly-active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . The development fix dose combination product commonly use help simplify dosage improve treatment compliance . One main problem associate treatment HIV infection change body structure , generally grouped term lipodystrophy . These usually include fat accumulation stomach , abdominal girth , , even bad , atrophy face , arm , leg . It usually associate metabolic disorder , increased level triglyceride , cholesterol and/or insulin resistance . The incidence lipodystrophy increase progressively time patient start treatment antiretroviral agent . It estimate , 2 year treatment , 20 % -30 % patient experience moderate severe lipodystrophy . Trizivir® combination three antiretroviral agent : Abacavir , Lamivudine Zidovudine tablet . All belong group nucleoside/nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs . The main advantage Trizivir possibility simplify antiretroviral treatment . Multiple study perform show simplification HAART Trizivir enhance compliance improve quality life patient maintain efficacy previous antiretroviral treatment . Kaletra® ( lopinavir+ritonavir ) combination two protease inhibitor : lopinavir plus low dose ritonavir , enhance action former . Previous study show patient treat Kaletra monotherapy undetectable viral load 48 week . Monotherapy failure associate development primary resistance mutation . To date development lipoatrophy appear occur frequently patient NRTI- contain regimen . The combination abacavir , zidovudine lamivudine investigate patient naive antiretroviral treatment patient already treat NRTIs . In set , design clinical trial establish potential benefit Kaletra monotherapy prevention lipoatrophy . For purpose , compare keep treatment TZV patient viral suppression v switch Kaletra monotherapy order prevent fat change . Since purpose study establish ability Kaletra prevent development exclude patient acute intolerance Kaletra , patient assign experimental group treat 4 week Trizivir Kaletra switch Kaletra monotherapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients infect HIV 1 document positive HIV 1 antibody test and/or positive PCR test confirm HIV 1 RNA . Patients treatment Trizivir undetectable viral burden define &lt; 50 copies/ml past 6 month . Men woman age ≥ 18 year . CD4 cell count ≥ 200 cells/μl . For woman child bearing age , negative urine pregnancy test screen visit . Patients give write informed consent complete study specific screen procedure . Patients previously fail therapy protease inhibitor ( PI ) receive sub optimum therapy nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) study disease . Presence lipoatrophy define investigator ( grade ) patient ( case , least two site mild degree one least moderate degree ) . Known history drug addiction chronic use alcohol , investigator 's opinion , contraindicate participation study . Pregnant nursing woman woman child bear age use adequate contraceptive method accord investigator 's criterion . Current active opportunistic infection document infection 4 week prior screen . Renal disease creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min . Concomitant use nephrotoxic immunosuppressive agent . Patient currently treat systemic corticosteroid , interleukine 2 , chemotherapy . Patients treat investigational agent . Patients acute hepatitis . Any disease , criterion investigator , contraindicate patient 's participation study .</criteria>
