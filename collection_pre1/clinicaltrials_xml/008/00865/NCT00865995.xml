	<brief_title>Pepsin As A Biomarker For Aspiration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aspiration well recognize child chronic lung disease intubate . There know association gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) aspiration . The distinction aspiration swallow material , food aspiration refluxed gastric content important . Determining whether aspiration syndrome individual due GER may difficult . The widely use test determine whether GER cause aspiration involve stain bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid lipid laden macrophage ( LLM ) base hypothesis refluxed aspirate fluid phagocytosed tracheal macrophage . Pepsinogen protein unique gastric chief cell also require acidic condition activation . Therefore presence pepsin BAL fluid find gastric fluid aspirate . In previous study , pepsin detect tracheal fluid child chronic lung disease . Thus far , study material small , control group , LLM look study . Based previous study need improve diagnostic method , follow aim propose : 1. determine frequency pepsin contamination child without chronic respiratory disease undergo elective surgery intubation 2. determine frequency tracheal pepsin lipid laden macrophage ( LLM ) child chronic respiratory disease symptom child tracheostomy 3. compare presence absence concentration pepsin presence LLM 4. relate presence absence concentration pepsin clinical status To achieve aim , BAL fluid obtain subject patient control . These fluid transport research lab store ice analysis . Determination LLM do child undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy clinical lab CHW per routine . BAL analysis consist Western blot stain presence pepsin . Demographic data also collect medical record .</detailed_description>
