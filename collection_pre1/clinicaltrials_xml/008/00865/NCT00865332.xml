	<brief_summary>Background : - Brain imaging study , genetic research , investigation stress provide information role dopamine process reward punishment , vulnerability substance dependence . Researchers interested learn brain responds reward , include drug abuse , response may involve genetic factor previous stressful event . - Researchers intend use drug amphetamine increase level dopamine brain study effect two kind scan : functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Objectives : - To examine relationship among dopamine function , brain activity , reward processing , genetic profile exposure stress normal healthy adult . - To examine variation factor normal healthy adult individual current cocaine-dependence . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 45 year age either current cocaine user healthy volunteer history substance abuse dependence . Design : - The study consist initial evaluation session six study visit , four involve fMRI scan ( 3 hour ) two involve PET scan ( 8 9 hour ) . - Cocaine-using participant enter inpatient clinical research ward National Institute Drug Abuse Addiction Research Center night scan session discharge following day . Healthy volunteer subject require stay overnight arrive outpatient PET session . Participants release researcher determine participant experience significant effect drug . - Initial session ( 1 ) : Participants complete questionnaire past reaction stressful situation , train think task perform fMRI visit . The task practice mockup MRI machine . - MRI session ( 2-5 ) : Participants receive either oral amphetamine placebo , perform thinking , short-term memory , reward task MRI scan direct researcher . - PET session ( 6-8 ) : Participants receive either oral amphetamine placebo , provide blood sample PET scan session . Participants short break PET scan session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This protocol integrate functional brain image reward processing , together assessment response oral dextroamphetamine ( d-AMPH ) , monoaminergic genotyping , evaluation past exposure stress , order examine : ( 1 ) relationship factor ( i.e . dopamine function , brain activity , reward processing , genetic profile exposure stress ) normal healthy adult ; ( 2 ) variation factor normal healthy adult individual current cocaine-dependence , variation contributes observe behavioral functional difference population . Study Population : The study population consist adult ( 18-45 year old ) healthy volunteer history substance abuse dependence match group individual current primary cocaine-dependence . Experimental Design Method : After medically clear give informed consent , participant undergo fMRI ( four session , separate day ) PET scan ( two session , separate day ) . All brain imaging session take place single-blind administration either d-AMPH ( 0.43 mg/kg orally ) placebo . Functional MRI commence dose include several measure ( cognitive affective ) design activate neural circuitry involve process reward punishment . PET scan also take place d-AMPH placebo involve administration radioligand [ 18F ] Fallypride ass CNS dopamine function . Outcome Measures : This study concern difference note factor experimental cohort ( control vs. cocaine-dependent adult ) condition ( baseline vs. post d-AMPH ) . The primary outcome measure , use ascertain difference , : ( 1 ) percentage change fMRI BOLD signal performance measure reward process cognitive function ; ( 2 ) alteration difference bind potential [ 18F ] Fallypride ; ( 3 ) variation gene relate DArgic function individual group , contribution variation outcome measure ; ( 4 ) history exposure stressful event role behavioral functional outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Aged 18 45 year ; 2 . In good health , base history physical examination ; 3 . Righthanded ( assess use Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ; Oldfield , 1971 ) All participant cocaine group must meet DSMIV criterion cocaine dependence time participation . Cocainedependent participant must also positive cocaine use urine toxicology screen . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Potential participant either experimental group exclude participation study accord follow criterion : 1 . Current drug use : Subjects may smoke regular cigarette , use moderate amount alcohol caffeine , smoke occasional marijuana cigarette . Moderate alcohol use define men , less ten drink woman le 7 drink liquor ( 1.5 oz ) equivalent beer ( 12 oz ) wine ( 5 oz ) per week . Moderate caffeine use define less 500 mg caffeine per day , one 5oz serve coffee 2 12oz serving caffeinated soft drink tea contain 100 mg . Occasional marijuana use define less equal 2 cigarettes/month . Participants may use alcohol marijuana least 24 hour prior scan , allow smoke regular cigarette accord normal usage pattern . Participants meet guideline current drug use allow participate study . 2 . Current Past Medication Use : Volunteers may currently use chronic ( define daily 10/14 day last month ) prescription counter medication might interfere image signal ( PET MRI ) may interact adversely substance give protocol . This include , limited , antihypertensive , antiallergy , pain medication . In addition , use psychotropic medication , particularly antidepressant antipsychotic medication , exclusionary . Past use antidepressant medication evaluate case case basis ; however , use MAOI 's within 14 day AMPH administration exclusionary due possibility precipitate hypertensive crisis . Over counter prescription medication may use occasional basis ( example , treatment selflimited condition , occasional headache , musculoskeletal discomfort , allergic symptom pain ) , medication interact AMPH Vitamin C , Lglutamine , sodium bicarbonate , sodium phosphate exclusionary . In addition , current use overthecounter estrogenlike compound exclusionary female participant . Subjects previously significant exposure medication act DA system ( antipsychotic , psychostimulants ) also exclude study . 3 . CNS disease : History know structural brain abnormality ( e.g . neoplasm , subarachnoid cyst ) , cerebrovascular disease , infectious disease ( e.g . abscess ) , history head trauma ( define document loss consciousness &gt; 5 min injury require hospitalization ) , history seizure adult , sleep apnea , tic disorder exclusionary . 4 . Cardiovascular , pulmonary , systemic disease : Repeated ( measure three separate occasion ) diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg , systolic blood pressure &gt; 135 mm Hg , know arrhythmia , symptomatic know coronary artery disease ; history endocarditis , cerebral embolism , obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma , active tuberculosis , know endocrine disease ( derangement adrenal , thyroid , bone reproductive function ) , know chronic renal hepatic dysfunction , know HIV seropositive , know current autoimmune disease involve CNS , glaucoma , allergy amphetamine , dextroamphetamine know hypersensitivity sympathomimetic amine . 5 . Female participant currently pregnant nursing allow participate study . Female subject give serum pregnancy test maximum 24 hour prior PET session urine pregnancy test day fMRI session . 6 . Radiation exposure : Any subject participate research study he/she receive radiation exposure expose radiation medical purpose , combination present study would result total effective radiation exposure ( research study ) exceed 5.0 rem year exclude . 7 . Children age 18 exclude avoid unnecessary exposure radiation population . 8 . Presence body metallic implant material could move magnet MRI scanner exclude participant study . This include , limited , pacemaker , surgical implant , aneurysm clip , dental brace , bullet ( ) . A history work metal consequent possible metal fragment body may also result study exclusion . 9 . Miscellaneous exclusionary criterion : Body mass great 300 lb . Hematocrit &lt; 39.0 % male &lt; 35.0 % female . Participants also exclude vein inaccessible . 10 . Claustrophobia also serve exclusion criterion . Control Participants In addition criterion outline , potential control participant exclude meet follow criterion : 1 . Current past psychiatric illness : DSMIV criterion use ( DSMIV , APA , 1994 ) determine criterion . No subject current axis I diagnosis allow participate . 2 . History Drug Abuse : Control volunteer report either current significant history illicit drug abuse ( define single illicit substance use 30 time lifetime give substance , except marijuana ) exclude study . 3 . Positive urine toxicology screen either amphetamine cocaine prior study participation . CocaineDependent Subjects Candidates cocainedependent group exclude study : 1 . They actively seek engage substance abuse treatment . 2 . They dependent substance except nicotine cocaine time participation .</criteria>
