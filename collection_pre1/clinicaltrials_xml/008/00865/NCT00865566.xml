	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness HIV-1 DNA Plasmid Vaccine HIV-1 Recombinant Adenoviral Vector Vaccine HIV-Uninfected , Circumcised Men Male-to-Female ( MTF ) Transgender Persons Who Have Sex With Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2007 , Joint United Nations Programme HIV/AIDS estimate 33.2 million people live HIV/AIDS globally . The U.S. HIV prevalence data report October 2008 Centers Disease Control Prevention estimate 1.1 million adult adolescent live diagnose undiagnosed HIV infection United States end 2006 . Nearly half U.S. HIV infection ( 48.1 % ) find men sex men ( MSM ) . Given difficulty maintain behavior prevent HIV transmission lifetime occurrence nonconsensual sex , need safe effective vaccine clear . The primary purpose study determine safety efficacy VRC DNA/rAd5 vaccine regimen healthy , at-risk , circumcise men MTF transgender person sex men . Participants randomly assign one two arm . Participants Arm 1 receive recombinant DNA plasmid vaccine injection study entry Days 28 56 , follow recombinant adenoviral serotype vector vaccine injection Day 168 . Participants Arm 2 receive placebo injection study entry Days 28 , 56 , 168 . Participants become HIV infect actively follow minimum 24 month continue follow study long-term safety surveillance total 5 year follow enrollment . Participants contact annually period long-term safety surveillance . Participants find HIV infect prior receive first injection receive first injection HIV infect prior study start follow modified schedule . Participants become HIV infect follow 6 month post-diagnosis . At study visit , participant undergo physical exam blood draw . NOTE : As April 2013 , vaccination study stop . Participants notify whether receive study vaccine placebo . Participants diagnose HIV infection attend study visit 6 month health monitoring .
