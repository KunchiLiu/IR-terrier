	<brief_title>Lopinavir/r Monotherapy Versus Abacavir/Lamivudine Lopinavir/r Limb Fat Recovery Persons With Lipoatrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After ten year since start , already establish highly-active antiretroviral treatment ( HAART ) cause dramatic reduction morbidity mortality human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . However , HAART exempt limitation , namely , toxicity long-term ; special importance treatment HIV chronic . Most common HAART involve use two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( nucleoside nucleotide analogue , NRTIs ) either protease inhibitor ( PI ) non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) . However , regimen remove family , base three NRTIs , ZDV+3TC+ABC . HAART associate constellation major metabolic adverse event , fat redistribution ( lipodystrophy , lipoatrophy , lipohypertrophy-central obesity - ) hyperlipidemia ( hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia ) . Lipoatrophy , specifically , occur loss subcutaneous fat mass upper low extremity , possible appearance venomegaly face buttock Lipoatrophy particularly distressing , stigma component , affect quality life psychological condition patient.This also direct impact treatment compliance , reduce , , therefore , risk therapeutic regimen fail effective resistance selection . Although initially metabolic adverse event attribute PIs , recent year show lipoatrophy specifically related therapy NRTIs PIs ; specifically , d4T , ddI ZDV . One accept strategy management lipoatrophy patient receive therapy ZDV replacement NRTI TDF ABC , consequently , significant fat recovery see . In study therapy ZDV discontinue continue NNRTIs ( lopinavir/ritonavir-LPV/r nevirapine-NVP ) therapy , fat recovery extremity seem high patient ZDV replace ABC . Lopinavir ( ABT-378 ) potent protease inhibitor HIV . The proven efficacy safety LPV/r-based HAART lead inclusion since 2003 therapeutic guideline therapy preferential start PI/r base . With regard relationship lipoatrophy , recent data show LPV/r low risk induction profile . In recent year data publish use LPV/r monotherapy : starting , induction-maintenance therapy HAART sustain undetectability least 6 month . Given aforementioned data , patient develop lipoatrophy treat ZDV+ABC+3TC , approach switch regimen absence LPV/r-based nucleoside could even beneficial remove ZDV maintain HAART contain LPV/r+ABC+3TC . Despite fact lipoatrophy associate ABC/3TC low treatment-naive patient , yet demonstrate discontinue even `` benign '' nucleoside could provide additional benefit patient already develop lipoatrophy . Accordingly , work hypothesis study would follow : recovery reversion lipoatrophy would increase patient receive LPV/r monotherapy v switch classic LPV/r-based HAART . The absence nucleoside would beneficial fat recovery extremity .</detailed_description>
