	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess performance subcutaneous glucose sensor extend sensor life . The sensor currently approve 3 day use study examine sensor safety accuracy use six day . This study also test sensor safety accuracy inserted alternate body location ( buttock area addition abdomen area ) . The study hypothesis sensor performance greatly diminish use six day , alternate insertion area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Inpatient Evaluation Six-Day Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Medtronic MiniMed Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor originally approve FDA commercialization part Continuous Glucose Monitoring System ( CGMS ) June 15 , 1999 ( PMA 980022 ) . The Sensor compose microelectrode thin coat glucose oxidase beneath several layer biocompatible membrane . This sensor use part Guardian REAL-Time System , late advance continuous glucose monitoring , base CGMS . Similar CGMS , Guardian REAL-Time System develop use conjunction standard home blood glucose meter . The Guardian REAL-Time receive regulatory approval FDA 2006 . As currently use , Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor label maximum use duration 72 hour , use abdomen area insertion site . Recent study show useful sensor life could extend beyond three day , reasonable expect significant percentage sensor last six day . It goal study confirm sensor performance accuracy data one recent study . The sensor also commonly worn body area abdomen ( buttock ) . This study also demonstrate sensor accuracy use alternate site .</detailed_description>
