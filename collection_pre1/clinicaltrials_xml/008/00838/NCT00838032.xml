	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Quetiapine Fumarate Instant-Release ( Seroquel IR ) Controlling Agitation Aggressive Symptoms Acute Treatment Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Agitation aggression common symptom acute schizophrenic patient . Under symptom , schizophrenic patient could harmful well environment people surround . Patients ' agitation aggression also part reason hospitalisation . Therefore , rapid control agitation aggression patient critical ensure treatment adherence , patient could stay treatment long time . Some study already provide method rapid control , haloperidol common medication . However , use haloperidol bring patient prominent adverse reaction , extropyromidal symptom etc. , lead poor adherence patient caregiver finally increase treatment risk rather benefit , relapse , re-hospitalization , poor social functioning etc . Quetiapine fumarate , dibenzothiazepine derivative , atypical antipsychotic drug approve treatment schizophrenia , bipolar mania , bipolar depression FDA many country worldwide . In China , use treatment patient schizophrenia approximately 10 year . Quetiapine advantage broad symptom control , individualize dose range , important , good efficacy tolerability acute treatment schizophrenic patient . Quetiapine fumarate indicate treatment patient schizophrenia China . Lots clinical experience evidence demonstrate efficacy tolerability patient population . Some evidence show quetiapine fumarate could control aggression agitation within 1 week , appropriate acute treatment patient schizophrenia . PANSS MOAS common measurement efficacy psychotic symptom control clinical trial . Generally , 2 week appropriate timeframe evaluation clinical effect agitation aggression symptom control . In adult patient schizophrenia , quetiapine fumarate license maximal dose 750mg/day . The target dose quetiapine fumarate recommend manufacturer 's prescribe information 300-450 mg/day China , though similar efficacy quetiapine fumarate ( 600 mg/day ) , olanzapine ( 15 mg/day ) Risperidone ( 5 mg/day ) report small , randomised , rater-blinded trial . Because low incidence EPS , limitation potential weight gain prolactin elevation , quetiapine fumarate well tolerate sensitive patient population high dose ( 600mg/day-750mg/day ) ( Peuskens 2004 ) . The aim present study evaluate efficacy safety quetiapine fumarate daily dose 600-750mg/day improve agitation aggression treatment Chinese acute schizophrenic patient hospitalise acute phase treatment period 2 week This 2-week , single-blinded , randomised , parallel-group haloperidol-controlled pilot study . After give informed consent undergo screening procedure , patient allocate study treatment Day 1 . Patients diagnosis schizophrenia CCMD-3 criterion MOAS total score least 10 . Eligible patient randomise quetiapine group haloperidol group 1-week dose titration ( least 600 mg/day quetiapine 8 mg/day haloperidol Day 7 ) . After , patient treat define dose range another week .</detailed_description>
