	<detailed_description>The dorsal hand vein model relatively non-invasive robust experimental model examine local vivo effect vasoactive drug without elucidate systemic counterregulatory reflex . Infusion incremental low dos phenylephrine dorsal hand vein result increase local venoconstriction , without systemic effect . Similarly , infusion incremental low dos nitroglycerin preconstricted dorsal hand vein result increase local venodilation , without systemic effect . Systemic vascular response measure cold pressor test ( CPT ) , lead increase blood pressure heart rate , mental stress also know stimulate cardiovascular response . Individuals vary local systemic vascular response genetic determinant clear .</detailed_description>
