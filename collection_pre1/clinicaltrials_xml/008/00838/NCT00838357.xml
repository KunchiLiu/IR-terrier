	<brief_title>A Multi-centre , Open Label , Single-arm Study Intended Further Investigate Safety Efficacy Plerixafor Front-line Mobilisation Agent Combination With G-CSF Patients With Lymphoma MM ( Multiple Myeloma ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients advance treatment-refractory Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) , Hodgkin 's Disease ( HD ) Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) may successfully treat high dose chemotherapy follow autologous transplantation peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSCs ) . Successful engraftment peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSCs ) well correlate number CD34+ cell infuse . Stem cell collection plerixafor could major benefit increase circulate number PBSCs decrease number apheresis session require collect sufficient number PBSCs transplant . This multi-centre , open label , single-arm study intend investigate safety efficacy plerixafor patient NHL , HD , MM . Patients previously fail stem cell mobilisation attempt previously receive one autologous allogeneic stem cell transplant eligible . Screening eligibility take place 30 day first dose G-CSF . Patients receive stem cell mobilisation regimen consist plerixafor G-CSF . Patients give G-CSF 4 consecutive day morning . Starting even Day 4 , plerixafor administer subcutaneously ( SC ) . The plerixafor dose time allow 10- 11-hour interval plerixafor dose initiation apheresis . Patients may continue receive even dose plerixafor G-CSF next morning follow apheresis total 5 apheresis procedure minimum least 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg NHL/HD 6 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg MM collect . More cell may collect do within 5 apheresis procedure . Stem cell collection take place use standard procedure . Following last apheresis , patient undergo pre-transplant myeloablative chemotherapy follow transplantation collect autologous stem cell , use establish protocol procedure site . Peripheral blood sample collect determine number CD34+ cell peripheral blood . In addition , sample obtain apheresis product determine quantity CD34+ cell collected procedure . Safety data report accord guideline provide protocol . Adverse event ( AE ) guidance summarise protocol . Investigators grade AEs use National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , version 3.0 . Efficacy base quantity CD34+ cell harvest subsequent engraftment graft status . Patients undergo haematopoietic stem cell transplantation monitor graft status 100 day , 6 month , 12 month .</detailed_description>
