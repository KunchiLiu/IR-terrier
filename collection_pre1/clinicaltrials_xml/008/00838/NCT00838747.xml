	<brief_summary>The folate receptor ( FR ) cell marker express cell surface certain cancer , occur frequently ovarian cancer . Some normal tissue also express FR , however normal tissue FR usually locate tissue surface inaccessible circulate drug . As , drug target FR may potentially use achieve anti-tumour efficacy whilst reduce toxicity normal tissue . Therefore ability measure FR level different cancer type may help select patient likely benefit treatment FR target therapy . One drug BGC 945 currently test preclinical study The Institute Cancer Research</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement Folate Receptor Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A method develop laboratory able measure FR obtain cancer cell culture add blood . We would like study method measure FR plasma serum obtain patient ovarian cancer . We would also like analyse plasma serum sample obtain healthy volunteer determine appreciable level FR , compare measurement obtain cancer patient .</detailed_description>
