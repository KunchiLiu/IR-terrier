	<brief_summary>Transfusion red blood cell often use critically ill patient low red blood cell count prevent disease progression death . Recent study suggest use `` age '' versus `` fresh '' red blood cell associated bad clinical outcome . There evidence red blood cell work cell line blood vessel produce variety substance normally cause artery relax increase blood supply . Two substance call nitric oxide ( NO ) endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor ( EDHF ) . The investigator try determine nature substance human being transfuse `` age '' versus `` fresh '' red blood cell . It think `` age '' red blood cell less substance ( NO EDHF ) naturally relax artery change blood supply . One way determine transfuse subject 's `` age '' `` fresh '' red blood cell inject substance L-NMMA ( L-NG monomethyl arginine ) TEA ( tetraethylammonium chloride ) , block production NO EDHF respectively , , study happen blood flow . There evidence red blood cell produce NO , normally cause artery relax increase blood supply . The investigator try determine nature NO red blood cell whether amount substance alter different blood processing storage technique . It think `` age '' red blood cell less NO naturally relax artery change blood supply . This study design determine ideal way store process blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adverse Effects RBC Transfusions : A Unifying Hypothesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transfusion red blood cell ( RBCs ) often effective prevent morbidity mortality anemic patient . In contrast , recent study indicate RBC component may functional defect ( `` RBC storage lesion '' ) actually cause morbidity mortality transfuse . For example , patient transfuse RBCs store &gt; 14 day statistically bad outcome receive `` fresher '' RBC unit . In addition age store RBCs , volume transfuse may important . The TRICC study show specific patient whose transfusion limit restrictive trigger ( RBCs transfusion hemoglobin [ Hb ] &lt; 7 g/dL ) significantly well outcome transfused liberal trigger ( [ Hb ] &lt; 10 g/dL Hb ) . This find particularly difficult understand since conventional wisdom suggest elevate [ Hb ] beneficial support increase O2 delivery . Recipient-specific factor may also contribute occurrence adverse event . Unfortunately , event difficult investigate exist `` statistical occurrence '' increase morbidity mortality large data set . There currently clinical laboratory method detect study individual patient . The microcirculation compose continuum small vessel include small arteriole , capillary , post-capillary venule . The microcirculation represent actively-adjusting vascular circuit match blood flow ( O2 delivery ) local tissue oxygen demand . While physiologic mechanism match O2 delivery local requirement incompletely understood , endothelium-derived nitric oxide ( NO ) clearly play important role . Interestingly , recent work reveal addition transport O2 CO2 , RBC also control local NO concentration thus may also play surprisingly important role regulating blood flow microcirculation . Herein , investigator bring together previously unconnected data propose unifying hypothesis , center insufficient NO bioavailability ( INOBA ) , explain increased morbidity mortality observe patient follow RBC transfusion . In model , variable associate RBC unit ( storage time ; 2,3-DPG concentration ) transfusion recipient ( endothelial dysfunction ; hematocrit [ Hct ] ) collectively lead change NO level vascular bed . Under certain circumstance , variable `` align '' NO concentration markedly reduce , lead vasoconstriction , decrease local blood flow insufficient O2 delivery end organ . Under circumstance , likelihood morbidity mortality escalate . The INOBA hypothesis attractive explanatory power lead number readily testable prediction , investigate follow aim : Aim 1 : To investigate effect blood processing storage ( use standard FDA-approved condition ) NO production scavenge human RBCs/Hb vitro . Using sensitive biochemical assay ( electron spin resonance [ ESR ] ) rat aortic ring vitro bioassay , investigator test effect RBC storage time , leukoreduction , irradiation NO synthesis and/or scavenge intact RBCs free Hb . Modifications wash rejuvenation investigate possible approach correct abnormalities NO bioavailability . Aim 2 : To transfuse healthy volunteer investigate effect storage-related RBC change blood flow , tissue oxygenation , biomarkers cardiovascular function . The investigator determine whether RBCs prepare stored condition alter NO bioavailability vitro ( Aim 1 ) inhibit NO-mediated vasodilation , reduce tissue perfusion , decrease tissue O2 delivery healthy transfusion recipient vivo . The role 2,3-DPG depletion well exercise-induced O2 demand also investigate specialized experimental system .</detailed_description>
