	<brief_summary>Laser Trabeculoplasty show effective lower intraocular pressure ( IOP ) patient primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) . Although initially demonstrate Argon laser ( ALT ) , several laser system also employ comparable efficacy . Recently , Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) show low intraocular pressure comparable ALT . The advantage SLT target eye structure , trabecular meshwork , remain intact minimal damage cellular level . In contrast , ALT lower IOP expense scar trabecular meshwork . The purpose study evaluate efficacy lower IOP Pascal Laser Trabeculoplasty ( PLT ) employ reduce energy level compare ALT computer guide pattern laser treatment application .</brief_summary>
