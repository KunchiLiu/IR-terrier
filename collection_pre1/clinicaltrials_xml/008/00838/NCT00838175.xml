	<detailed_description>This retrospective cohort study consecutive patient receive suture-mediated closure femoral vein follow catheterization . All patient undergoing cardiac arterial catheterization Interventional Cardiovascular Medicine Service The Brigham Women 's hospital 3/1/02 onset study femoral venous access time consider closure venous site ; however , decision use closure device leave discretion physician . Contraindications use closure device include groin hematoma develop procedure and/or difficult access due extensive scar tissue surgery multiple prior vascular access . All in-hospital endpoint collect pre-existing Catheterization Laboratory Database . Patient 's data extract database indicated procedure . Each patient review clinical follow-up presence adverse event include limited hematoma , thrombosis , blood loss , vascular imaging , need additional procedure , re-admissions within 30 day closure . If necessary , data collect via phone interview patient . Univariate multivariate analysis perform determine factor predict inadequate incomplete closure development complication mention section . A predictive model base identify risk factor develop test prospectively next phase ongoing investigation .</detailed_description>
