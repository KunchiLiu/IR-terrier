	<brief_title>Effect High-dose Oral Rabeprazole Recurrent Bleeding After Endoscopic Treatment Bleeding Peptic Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>0.1 % hospitalized patient attribute upper gastrointestinal bleeding every year U.S. Europe , among peptic ulcer common cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding . Endoscopic hemostasis procedure management bleed due peptic ulcer safe well effective lower recurrent bleeding , surgery mortality . Endoscopic treatment widely use effective safe method disadvantage include need endoscopy specialist likelihood develop complication perforation recurrent bleed although rarely occur . Thus , less invasive medical treatment few side effect continuously study among , gastric acid inhibitor study most.Acid pepsin inhibit platelet aggregation , activation blood coagulation system , fibrinogen polymerization . Blood clot already form digested pepsin activity pepsin closely related intragastric pH level . Therefore , know elevate intragastric pH facilitates hemostasis process , induces hemostasis stabilize hematoma prevents recurrent bleeding . To suffice condition , report potent gastric acid inhibitor need maintain intragastric pH 6 high . For treatment bleed peptic ulcer , intravenous administration high-dose proton pump inhibitor initial endoscopic treatment show decline frequency recurrent bleed well surgery . Recent study report use oral proton pump inhibitor effective certain circumstance treatment bleed peptic ulcer . However , date , study conduct compare effect high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitor oral Rabeprazole endoscopic treatment bleed peptic ulcer . Therefore , study , administer high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitor high-dose oral Rabeprazole prevent recurrent bleed follow endoscopic treatment bleed peptic ulcer , go compare rate recurrent bleed two group well compare evaluate surgery rate , mortality rate number day hospital stay .</detailed_description>
