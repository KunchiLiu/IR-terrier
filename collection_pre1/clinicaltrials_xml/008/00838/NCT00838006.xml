	<detailed_description>The primary objective proposal develop objective pre-deployment predictor PTSD test two pre-deployment resiliency intervention . The objective predictor base : 1 ) physiologic reactivity ( heart rate , heart rate variability , eye blink startle , skin conductance ) virtual reality ( VR ) environments depict common Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) combat scenario 2 ) cognitive bias assessment use recognition memory paradigm . We hypothesize model combine physiologic reactivity cognitive bias predictor superior either physiologic reactivity cognitive bias model alone predict post-deployment PTSD . We also test two pre-deployment resiliency intervention : heart rate variability biofeedback cognitive bias modification training design target physiologic cognitive response stress , respectively . We compare prevention intervention intervention control group . We hypothesize prevalence post-deployment PTSD low intervention group compare control group .</detailed_description>
