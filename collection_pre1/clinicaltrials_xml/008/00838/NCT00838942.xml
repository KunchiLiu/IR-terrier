	<brief_summary>The VIVA study focus Alzheimer 's disease patient low vision due bilateral cataract . The aim study cataract surgery result patient ' autonomy , behaviour , mood . In fact dement elderly patient suffer progressive loss superior function , loss autonomy , behaviour mood degradation , associate physical disability . The work hypothesis loss sensorial function , particularly visual , aggravating factor NEURO-cognitive trouble absence communication outside circle . The protocol consist investigate superior function , autonomy , behaviour trouble participate patient , help series neuropsychological test use one month three month cataract operation eye bad vision . Independently study , patient must give informed consent cataract surgery . Their participation last 4 months+/- 1 month . The aim study evaluate whether cataract surgery improve patient ' behaviour , autonomy mood possibly show evidence onf drawback practice.The main objective target cataract surgery benefice patient suffer Alzheimer 's disease impeding cataract , aim improve behaviour trouble . The specific objective measure benefice correlation visual acuity improvement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VIVA study aim evaluate cataract surgery result Alzheimer patient regard behavior , autonomy mood . Patients study elderly people suffer Alzheimer 's disease low vision due bilateral impeding cataract . Designed patient come Ile-de-France-area geriatrics department . Methods : trial consist series neuropsychological test involve subject study close parent one-month three month surgery affect eye . Each patient investigation 4+/1 month . The test use MMS ( Mini Mental Status ) , ADAS-cog Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale cognitive function , NPI ( Neuropsychiatric Inventory ) behavior trouble , IADL ( Instrumental Activities Daily ) autonomy evaluation , GDS ( Geriatric Depression Scale ) Cornell Scale ( Cornell Scale Depression Dementia ) mood trouble . All data register along well medical treatment severe side effect . Practical method : An ophthalmologic surgery department head operate patient National Ophthalmologic Hospital `` QUINZE VINGT '' Paris.The surgery involve eye bad vision . Study analysis take account result second eye intervention . The surgery consist phacoemulsification set acrylic implant posterior chamber . Patients care consist usual procedure . The intervention perform regional anesthesia exceptionally general anesthesia . A three-day hospitalization regular consider patient ' fragility.The aim study analyze 3 month cataract surgery , different neuropsychological test , help appropriate statistic . The main endpoint criterion NPI-test improvement one-month test surgery three-month test . A correlation visual acuity improvement NPI-test improvement verify . The second endpoint criterion study score ( MMS , IADL , ADAS-cog , GDS Cornell test ) , matched-way . If improvement note , regression logistic study permit study improvement predictive factor . Each participant take part study 4+/-1 months.Study rationale literature data abstract.Cataract treatment , restore well visual function , greatly beneficial upon life quality elderly people , largely demonstrate ( 1 , 2 ) . Several study , base cognitive function , daily life activity , mood , show significant amelioration elderly people operate cataract , comparison refuse intervention ( 3 ) . Benefice less case ocular co morbidity old patient ( 4 ) .Cataract surgery elderly patient suffer cognitive decline give rise study . Nevertheless , correlation low vision cognitive alteration well establish . In France , Health High Authority ( HHA ) report devote cataract surgical treatment evaluation , base literature data expert opinion , publish 2000 ( 6 ) . The report deal take care demented low mental capacity patient . It regret trial undertaken problem.. In case begin dementia , expert think cataract surgery visual benefice limit . It seldom improve lecture allow patient watch television make contact neighbor easier . In case advance dementia , author think surgery would worsen rapidly patient . The report evoke well paternalistic decision take without dialogue involve patient raise ethical issue . Still to-day , case dementia , cataract management remain actual problem . This challenge close , guardian , geriatrics ' , ophthalmologist sometimes decision oppose patient ' feeling ( 8 ) .One study cite HHA report , base low-vision patient , show cataract surgery , light improvement mental status , everyday life poor result depression . After surgery , patient felt fragile thought , endured operation felt well ( 9 ) . In 2003 , Japanese study deal cognitive function 40 demented patient suffer cataract . Results show among 20 patient chose operate , 60 % improve , 35 % unchanged , 5 % worsen ( 10 ) . By extensive neuropsychological investigation Alzheimer ' patient , VIVA study would show impact visual function improvement cognitive function , psychological behavioural trouble , autonomy , mood perturbation . Pointing objective upon improvement neuropsychiatric survey , namely NPI test , study would permit precise low-vision cataract role patient ' comportment trouble cause burn-out caring people . It clearly demonstrate delirious manifestation , notably visual hallucination frequent demented person patient low vision well ( 9 ) . In low-vision patient , seem cataract significantly link visual hallucination ( 10 ) . The VIVA study aim show also benefice well visual function behavioural non-disturbing trouble apathy inhibition . Therefore , would like stress cataract management benefit Alzheimer 's disease patient . Particularly , intend precise extent expect patient ' improvement measure correlation visual acuity improvement</detailed_description>
