	<brief_summary>In study investigator explore relationship physical activity cannabis use . The investigator compare regional brain activation detect image technique ( fRMI ) exercise cannabis user compare result result control . The investigator hypothesize regional brain activation response visual cue ( picture relate cannabis use food ) different cannabis user control exercise significantly alter brain response cue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It unknown response cannabis user might compare non-users response similar dose physical activity . We therefore compare brain activation crave cannabis , natural reward ( food ) neutral scene ( nature image ) . The food cue allow u determine effect exercise brain activation crave generalize two different reward condition nature scene provide neutral , reward control . In addition analysis predetermine region interest , whole-brain exploratory analysis also conduct examine additional brain region show association various condition interest regional brain activation . Specific Aims 1 . To explore methodological factor involve find relationship PA cannabis use . 1. examine effect cannabis food cue brain activation crave cannabis user nonusers 2. examine effect vigorous exercise brain activation crave response cannabis food cue . Our work hypothesis regional brain activation response drug cue different cannabis user control exercise significantly alter brain response cue group . Our secondary hypothesis exercise tend normalize abnormal brain activation observe cannabis user . Our expectation exercise alter cue-responding term brain activation craving . It possible exercise may useful treatment cannabis dependence . Future study may examine specific relationship . There report available explore relationship physical activity cannabis use . Current data suggest convergent finding regard chronic acute effect cannabis brain activity</detailed_description>
