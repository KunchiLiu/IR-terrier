	<brief_summary>Vorinostat combination radiation therapy administer safely tolerated patient brain metastasis , provide assessment anti-tumor activity combination . This multi-center , open-label , non-randomized Phase I study patient brain metastasis . Patients administer oral Vorinostat radiation therapy treat 3 week . Patients enrol cohort treat sequentially rise dose level Vorinostat combine radiation therapy . We initially enter 3 subject dose . If none three experience dose-limiting toxicity proceed next dose . If one three experience level toxicity , accrue 3 subject dose . If time two dose-limiting toxicity ( 3-6 subject ) give dose , drop low dose . Dose escalation continue MTD Vorinostat radiation therapy establish . The MTD one dose DLT occur least 1 3 subject ( 2 6 patient ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combination Vorinostat Radiation Therapy Treatment Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , number investigator show combine signal transduction agent ionize radiation result significant antitumor effect without increase normal tissue toxicity . There numerous line evidence Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor show enhance radiosensitivity tumor cell vitro vivo 1-6 . Vorinostat ( Zolinza , suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid - SAHA ) potent histone deacetylase , recently approve clinical use cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . It potential inhibit tumor growth proliferation7-13 , tumor angiogenesis14 enhance radiation response15 minimal toxicity . This phase I study , base range efficacy Vorinostat ability cross blood-brain barrier . This study evaluate safety combination Vorinostat daily-fractionated radiation therapy . This information critical combine future combine modality trial involve radiation therapy brain . Vorinostat approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) 6-Oct-2006 treatment cutaneous manifestation patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) progressive , persistent recurrent disease follow two systemic therapy . Based preclinical , clinical efficacy safety data , anticipate Vorinostat combination radiation therapy administer safely tolerated patient brain metastasis . In addition , within recognize limit Phase I clinical trial , study may provide assessment anti-tumor activity Vorinostat combination radiation therapy patient brain metastasis . The present study investigate safety , tolerability spectrum side effect Vorinostat combination radiation therapy . As , study characterize dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination radiation therapy patient brain metastasis .</detailed_description>
