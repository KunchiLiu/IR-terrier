	<brief_summary>Inhaled corticosteroid widely use primary therapy asthma , affect approximately 20 million people United States . While many patient respond corticosteroid therapy , many 25-30 % patient severe asthma asthma difficult treat steroid insensitive . Predictive biomarkers rapid identification patient asthma achieve adequate control symptom inhale corticosteroid potential significantly improve asthma management . This proposal base hypothesis alteration gene expression epithelial cell buccal mucosa use reliable biomarker predict corticosteroid response patient asthma . The goal proposal determine gene expression epithelial cell buccal mucosa patient asthma concordance gene expression profile identify invasive sample technique airway epithelium asthma patient . The Specific Aims proposal 1 ) investigate level variability gene expression subset inflammatory marker buccal epithelium adult patient asthma . Aim 1 carry collect buccal sample three cohort subject ( 18-55 year age ) Pulmonology Allergy Clinics Truman Medical Center regularly schedule outpatient visit follow : 1 ) healthy control adult subject ( n=10 ) , 2 ) patient asthma treat short-acting beta2-agonist ( SABA , n=10 ) , 3 ) patient asthma treat low-dose ICS ( n=10 ) . Relative gene expression inflammatory marker determine use quantitative RT ( reverse transcription ) -PCR variability gene expression determine within three cohort . Data pilot study describe proposal aid determination appropriate study population size future investigation long-term objective use change gene expression ( buccal epithelial cell ) dynamic biomarker determine corticosteroid response patient asthma .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. healthy control adult subject ( n=10 ) , 2. patient mild moderate asthma ( n=20 ) ( Table 2 , Appendix 4 ) . A diagnosis asthma define episodic airflow obstruction reversible ( improvement FEV1 &gt; 12 % measure via spirometry ) administration SABA . 1. currently smoker smoker past 6 month 2. diagnosis COPD , bronchiectasis , Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis , diagnosis bacterial , fungal , viral pneumonia past 6 month , diagnose chronic lung disease . 3. subject treat oral systemic corticosteroid disease , use intranasal steroid 2 week period precede study , require oral corticosteroid burst past 6 week , receive treatment immune modulator medication also exclude study .</criteria>
