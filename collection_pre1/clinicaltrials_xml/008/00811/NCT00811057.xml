	<brief_summary>Preterm birth common costly complication obstetrics . It complicate 11 % pregnancy responsible 70 % sick baby . The ideal way stop preterm labor occurs ( drug use ) know . Currently magnesium sulfate use 95 % practitioner , recent data suggest magnesium give way may harmful baby 's future development . Other drug antiprostaglandin agent effective stop uterine activity , particularly use &gt; 48 hour associate maternal fetal side effect . Lastly , calcium channel antagonist effective stop contraction little way maternal fetal side effect , less data available United States use . Because FDA approve drug stop preterm labor , purpose randomize woman preterm labor ( 20-34 week ) receive one three method stop preterm labor . The primary outcome see agent stop uterine contraction effectively , long period time few relapse result significant prolongation pregnancy . If one agent clearly superior two would help woman avoid early delivery significant extension pregnancy avoid complication preterm birth baby .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preterm labor common complication pregnancy one catastrophic occur 10-12 % pregnancy account 80 % neonatal morbidity1 . In addition , delivery low birth weight baby often lead reduction cognitive academic skill well increase mental retardation age five2,3 . While many strategy treat woman preterm labor agent used side effect , acutely prolong pregnancy day , universally accept treatment long term prolongation use oral tocolytics home4,5,6 . While beta-agonists use several decade primary agent acute tocolysis , side effect lead agent relegate adjunctive therapy home care program programmable subcutaneous pump7 . Consequently tocolytic agent approve FDA use pregnancy . The common drug use acute tocolysis magnesium sulfate , administer intravenously stop contractions8 . While appear effective short-term tocolysis think effective anti-prostaglandins calcium channel antagonists quickly suppress uterine activity . In addition , controversy adverse effect neonate drug use impede uterine contractions9 . Some author feel cause adverse neurologic function baby others feel associated increase neonatal morbidity/mortality premature infants9.10 . Regardless , clinicians treat woman preterm labor magnesium remain main stay therapy . Newer development , however , point improve effectiveness anti-prostaglandin agent calcium channel antagonist concern treat patients7,11 . Calcium channel antagonist effective appear safer magnesium primary tocolytic treatment woman preterm labor12-14 . Tocolytic treatment anti-prostaglandin drug indomethacin , Cox-1 inhibitor , demonstrate effective rapid tocolytic agent available15 . Initially report increase complication use drug16,17 . However , show concern unwarranted indomethacin use limit 48 hour per treatment cycle amniotic fluid assess oligohydramnios ; therefore , pregnancy &lt; 32 week ample evidence justify use primary tocolytic18,19,20 . This particularly true new agent class ( Cox-2 inhibitor ) few fetal side effects7,11 . In sum , however , randomized trial demonstrate effectiveness three type agent . B . Specific Aim The purpose study compare three category clinically use tocolytic agent prospective study allow direct comparison outcomes woman confirm preterm labor . While magnesium sulfate tocolysis acute treatment preterm labor standard care , appear well tocolytic agent less maternal fetal side effect could use primary agent . C. Rationale While evidence primary tocolytic agent magnesium sulfate beta-agonist drug prolong pregnancy extensively compare placebo , preterm labor early delivery remain one top health problem perinatal field . For reason , investigation compare available first line agent warrant . Based current information literature calcium channel antagonists anti-prostaglandin drug best hope treat acute preterm labor effort significantly prolong pregnancy few adverse effect mother baby . D. Benefit Risk Ratio There tocolytic agent approve FDA importantly drug use purpose free maternal fetal side effect . However , treatment involve less risk preterm delivery . Because long experience medical community , magnesium sulfate remain number one choice obstetricians throughout United States , rather high rate maternal side effect often leading discontinuation drug . For acute treatment preterm labor calcium channel antagonists well anti-prostaglandins appear effective equal good safety profile mother baby use appropriately . The benefit effectively prolong pregnancy several week far outweigh medication effect mother fetus therefore , make continued investigation drug reasonable . E. Patient Population Patients recruit labor delivery area University Mississippi Medical Center . All patient meet admission criterion offer participation study . F. Materials Methods Patients experience confirm preterm labor ( regular uterine contraction , usually &lt; 5 minute apart , associated cervical change dilatation and/or effacement ) would consider potential participant . After preterm labor confirm informed consent obtain , patient randomize use sequentially number , seal opaque envelope receive intravenous magnesium ( 6gm load plus 6gm/per hour IV abolish contraction ) versus calcium channel antagonist ( nifedipine 30mg loading , 10 - 20mg q 4 - 6 hour ) versus antiprostaglandin ( indomethacin 100mg rectal suppository may repeat x1 25 - 50mg q 6 hour 48 hour ) . The amount tocolytic time record . If fails abolish uterine activity contraindication continue pregnancy ( eg abruptio placenta , chorioamnionitis , non-reassuring fetal tracing , etc . ) subcutaneous terbutaline ( beta-agonist ) give subcutaneously ( 250mg ) adjunctive measure abolish contraction . As routine use blood test , amniotic fluid assessment ultrasound detect infection abruptio placenta would lead delivery cessation tocolytic treatment . If continued failure tocolysis treatment rest physician although case pregnancy delivered time due continue contraction diagnosis complication list contraindicate continuation gestation . Women separately randomize dependent cervical status ( 0 - 3cm versus 4 - 6cm dilatation ) three choice . All hospital management corticosteroid therapy promote fetal lung maturity , continuous fetal heart rate monitoring , amnioinfusion , etc. , regardless group assessment , standard care . G. Data Analysis Data analysis standard statistical methodology . VII . Number Patients Needed : A sample size estimation indicate 240 patient ( 80 group ) necessary 80 % power ( decrease delivery &lt; 32 week 50 % ) detect significance &lt; 0.05 number preterm birth . Likewise , &gt; 4cm group ( assume 90 % delivery within seven day ) 40 patient group ( 120 woman ) necessary 80 % power detecting ( 25 % reduction delivery seven day ) significance &lt; 0.05 . It anticipate take time period approximately two year enroll number participant . VIII . Research Equipment Needed :</detailed_description>
