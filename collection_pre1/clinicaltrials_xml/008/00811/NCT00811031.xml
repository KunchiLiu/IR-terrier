	<brief_summary>Objectives : Primary : - To evaluate association probability increase phosphorylation platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) &gt; 0.5 peripheral blood leucocyte follow pre-operative docetaxel chemotherapy , progression-free survival localize castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) Secondary : - To evaluate association probability increase phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) expression peripheral blood leucocyte &gt; 0.5 index tumor regression include PSA-decline 50 % measure objective regression tumor transrectal MRI follow pre-operative docetaxel therapy . - Explore association probability increase phosphorylated PDGFR peripheral blood leucocyte follow pre-operative docetaxel therapy plasma PDGF kinetics spatial quantitative PDGF phosphorylated PDGFR expression tumor stromal compartment resect specimen . - Evaluate association probability increase phosphorylated PDGFR expression peripheral blood leucocyte follow pre-operative docetaxel chemotherapy overall survival outcome . - Assess global quality life measure baseline 6 12 month post-operatively . - Create tissue archive comprising tumor peripheral blood specimen suitable resource future genomic proteomic study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Docetaxel design stop growth cancer cell , may cause cell die . It believe weakly effective kill blood vessel cancer cell well . Prednisone docetaxel commonly use treat prostate cancer . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , Day 1 every 21-day study `` cycle '' , receive docetaxel needle vein 1 hour . Everyday , take prednisone mouth 2 time day ( morning evening ) . You take prednisone meal . You take dexamethasone mouth 12 hour 6 hour receive docetaxel . This help reduce risk allergic reaction fluid retention . It important take drug schedule . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - You ask side effect experience since last visit . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test test PSA testosterone level . On Day 1 Cycle 3 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw test PDGFR PDGF level . Surgery : If complete 2 cycle , eligible surgery part study . If eligible , 21 day last dose docetaxel , surgery remove prostate gland . You sign separate consent surgery , describe procedure risk detail . Before surgery , probably pre-surgical visit , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw test PDGFR PDGF level . Length Study : You take study drug 4 cycle surgery . You study treatment surgery . You take study early experience intolerable side effect disease get bad . This investigational study . Docetaxel give prednisone commercially available FDA approve treatment prostate cancer . Up 28 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
