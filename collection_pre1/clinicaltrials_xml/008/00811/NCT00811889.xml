	<brief_title>Trial Determine Effects Bardoxolone Methyl eGFR Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bardoxolone methyl ( RTA 402 ) Antioxidant Inflammation Modulator ( AIM ) undergo clinical test chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) cancer . Bardoxolone methyl AIMs inhibit immune-mediated inflammation restore redox homeostasis inflame tissue induce cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 . In diabetic population , adipocytes produce cytokine mobilize free fatty acid induce insulin resistance . Resultant hyperglycemia increase cytokine production induces reactive oxygen nitrogen specie turn induce vascular inflammation endothelial dysfunction . This process cause activation NF-kB , create vicious cycle inflammation , vasoconstriction , ischemia , end result sclerosis kidney coronary artery . By induce Nrf2 suppress redox-driven inflammation , hypothesize cycle inflammation sclerosis abrogate . Based Phase IIa data , hypothesize bardoxolone methyl improve renal function suppression renal oxidative stress , inflammation improvement glomerular filtration .</detailed_description>
