	<brief_summary>In patient underlie heart disease like hypertensive heart disease , coronary heart disease dilative cardiomyopathy obstructive sleep-apnea , central sleep-apnea Cheyne-Stokes-respiration common finding polysomnography . In lot patient neither purely obstructive sleep-apnea syndrome complete Cheyne-Stokes-respiration combination sleep related respiratory disturbance . Previous study show improvement central respiratory disorder , example Cheyne-Stokes-respiration , continuous positive pressure breathing ( CPAP ) improvement leave ventricular pump function . ( Naughton 1995 , Tkacova 1997 ) . However , recently publish CanPAP study could prove improvement mortality among CPAP therapy patient comparison optimal medical treatment , although therapy , number breathing disturbance , oxygen saturation night ejection fraction leave ventricle show significant improvement . ( Bradley 2005 ) Earlier study prove adaptive servo ventilation effective therapy patient central sleep-apnea Cheyne-Stokes-respiration respectively . ( Teschler 2001 ) Teschler 's study show adaptive servo ventilation therapy reduction central sleep apnea 10/hours succeed . With SOMNOvent CR new therapy-algorithm develop adaptive servo ventilation patient obstructive sleep apnea Cheyne-Stokes-respiration underlying heart disease . In first validation study therapy effective present adverse effect patient . ( Galetke 2007 ) The goal study compare new therapeutic option ( SOMNOvent CR ) establish method continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) patient combination obstructive sleep-apnea syndrome Cheyne-Stokes-respiration underlying heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison CPAP With SOMNOventCR Patients With Underlying Heart Disease , Combined OSA CSR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients meet mention criterion diagnose sleep-apnoea syndrome patient hospital ask participate study . We divide patient two group : Group 1 : start CPAP continue SOMNOvent CR Group 2 : begin SOMNOvent CR end CPAP First CPAP-titration apply fix group second night . During third night receive either CPAP- pressure ( first group ) adaptive servo ventilation ( second group . The patient discharge hospital continuing procedure third night . After four week new admission sleep laboratory necessary , first night , control investigation procedure last four week . The procedure change next night , patient first group sleep SOMNOventCR-device patient second group CPAP-device . After wash-out-period week four-week treatment last procedure final in-hospital polysomnography perform adaptive servo ventilation apply first group fix CPAP second group . After study end , patient receive therapy procedure effective well tolerate . The following analysis carry addition polysomnographic measurement : Admission 1 : Berlin questionnaire , European sleep questionnaire , echocardiography , 6 minute walk test , patient questionnaire . Admission 2 : ESS , Berlin questionnaire , echocardiography , 6 minute walk test , patientsÂ´ questionnaire . After wash-out-period : ESS , Berlin questionnaire , patient questionnaire . Admission 4 : ESS , Berlin questionnaire , echocardiography , 6 minute walk test , patient questionnaire .</detailed_description>
