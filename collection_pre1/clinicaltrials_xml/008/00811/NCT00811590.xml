	<brief_summary>Pilot study , Open-label , Phase II study Everolimus . Objective : To determine Everolimus diminish large gastrointestinal polyp patient Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome . Methodology : Polyp size number compare baseline FDG-PET CT 12 month treatment Everolimus . Since pilot study , polyps prior treatment serve control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome hereditary polyposis condition hamartomatous tumor develop many tissue body . These tumor benign frequently cause gastrointestinal obstruction bleed begin 2nd-3rd decade life necessitate surgical intervention . Unfortunately , recent study show lifetime risk cancer arise Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome 85 % age 70 year 60 % age 60 year ( Hearle et al. , 2006 ) . A working definition PJS suggest Giardiello et al ,1987 ( www.genetests.com ) : - For individual histopathologically confirm hamartoma , definite diagnosis PJS require two follow three finding : - Family history consistent autosomal dominant inheritance - Mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation ( although fade age ) - Small-bowel polyposis - For individual without histopathologic verification hamartomatous polyp , probable diagnosis PJS make base presence two three clinical criterion . - For individual without family history PJS , diagnosis depend upon presence two histologically verified Peutz-Jeghers-type hamartomatous polyp ( Tomlinson &amp; Houlston 1997 ) . - For individual first-degree relative PJS , presence mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation sufficient presumptive diagnosis . Recently , rapamycin ( Rapamune , Wyeth ) , FDA-approved drug use orthotopic transplant recipient , successfully use off-label study 5 individual related condition call tuberous sclerosis patient subependymal giant cell astrocytomas cause significant insidious neurological problem hydrocephalus seizure ( Franz , et al . 2006 ) . All astrocytoma lesion exhibit regression treatment oral rapamycin one case , necrosis . Treatment well tolerate may offer alternative operative therapy tuberous sclerosis . Tuberous sclerosis cause germline mutation tuberous sclerosis 1 2 gene . These gene encode protein function downstream STK11 , gene mutate Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome . Mutations STK11 TSC1/2 lead activation mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) . Dysregulation mTOR demonstrate several type cancer clinical trial underway see inhibition mTOR benefit variety cancer patient . A recent trial show efficacy everolimus advance renal cancer ( Hudes , et al . 2007 ) . All study perform outpatient basis .</detailed_description>
