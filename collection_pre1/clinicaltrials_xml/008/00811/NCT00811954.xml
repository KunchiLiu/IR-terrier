	<brief_summary>The U.S. Department Health Human Services ( HHS ) guideline recommend HIV infect patient never receive anti-HIV therapy treat triple drug regimen . The commonly prescribe successful regimen contain medication efavirenz ( EFV ) . However , regimen may option everyone , hence alternative regimen need . This study design look well different combination anti-HIV drug work decrease amount HIV blood ( viral load ) allow immune system recovery people never receive anti-HIV therapy . This study also examine drug tolerability safety various drug combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Three NNRTI-Sparing HAART Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of five anti-HIV drug class , four recommend first-line regimen patient never receive anti-HIV treatment ( treatment naive ) : nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) , Integrase Inhibitors ( INIs ) protease inhibitor ( PIs ) . The U.S. Department Health Human Services ( HHS ) guideline recommend treatment-naive HIV infect patient treated triple drug regimen include 2 NRTIs + 1 NNRTI , 2 NRTIs + INI , 2 NRTIs + 1 PI initial treatment regimen . According data , efavirenz ( EFV ) -containing regimen ( 2 NRTIs + 1 NNRTI , EFVas NNRTI ) require few pill patient , mild side effect , effective reduce viral load regimen , make preferred choice patient . However , patient , EFV-containing regimen feasible due side effect , acquire NNRTI-resistant HIV virus , undesirable effect . For patient , necessary find alternative regimen comparable safety efficacy . This study examine well different combination anti-HIV drug work , include safety drug tolerability various combination . This phase III , prospective , randomize study . Participants randomly assign one three different group ( treatment arm ) —A , B , C —each represent different drug combination regimen , none contain NNRTI . Arm A : Atazanavir ( ATV ) + Ritonavir ( RTV ) + Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) Arm B : Raltegravir ( RAL ) + FTC/TDF Arm C : Darunavir ( DRV ) + RTV + FTC/TDF The duration study 96 192 week , depend participant enrol . There total 1,809 participant , approximately 600 per treatment arm . Screening pre-entry evaluation must occur prior participant start study medication , treatment , intervention . Participants randomly assign treatment group entry visit must begin treatment within 72 hour randomization . Participants tell group medication administer . The study drug distribute entry . All drug provide study exception RTV , would obtain participant 's primary care physician ( Group A C ) . If participant unable tolerate study medication course study doctor could switch another regimen . During study , participant ask return clinic Weeks 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 36 , 48 every 16 week end study . They also contact telephone Week 2 check status . Visits last 1 hour . At visit , participant physical exam answer question medication take . Additionally , participant complete questionnaire address smoke alcohol habit , blood drawn , ask give urine sample . At visit , participant come clinic without eaten 8 hour . If participant female able become pregnant , pregnancy test might give visit pregnancy suspect . Some participant A5257 ask participate optional metabolic substudy A5260s . This substudy take place study sit continue last 144 week , include time A5257 . The primary focus substudy examine carotid artery intima-media thickness ( CIMT ) relate RTV- RAL-containing regimen . Randomization , stratification , treatment assignment , study visit per A5257 .</detailed_description>
