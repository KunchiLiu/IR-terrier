	<brief_summary>The clinical radiological data patient acute ischemic stroke treat intravenous thrombolysis ( IVT ) intraarterial thrombolysis ( IAT ) Swiss stroke unit assess Swiss Multicenter Thrombolysis Registry . Like clinical routine , clinical evaluation take place 3-months follow-up . Furthermore quality life assess standardized questionnaire . The aim registry compare safety efficacy IVT IAT patient acute ischemic stroke . The registry also help improve in-hospital-management stroke patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Swiss Intravenous Intra-arterial Thrombolysis Treatment Acute Ischemic Stroke Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Intravenous thrombolysis ( IVT ) intra-arterial thrombolysis ( IAT ) show effective treatment acute stroke control randomized trial meta-analyses . However , prospective study compare IVT IAT perform , know patient benefit IVT IAT . Non-invasive neurovascular image technique magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) potential improve patient selection optimal mode thrombolytic therapy provide data pre-treatment neurovascular finding patient treat IVT . IAT series identify several prognostic factor favourable poor outcome predictor vessel recanalization , location vascular occlusion NIHSS admission . Additional study show recanalization rate patient central ves-sel occlusion middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) main stem MCA main branch basilar artery ( BA ) high treat IAT compare IVT . Therefore , investigator hypothesize IAT might efficacious patient . Objective : Prospective observational multicenter registry follow aim : To compare safety efficacy IAT IVT patient acute ischemic stroke . To improve safety IAT IVT monitor in-hospital management . Methods : Consecutive patient acute ischemic stroke treat IVT IAT within 6 hour symptom onset Swiss stroke unit eligible registry . Patients give either intravenous rt-PA receive IAT intra-arterial urokinase , intra-arterial rt-PA mechanical endovascular recanalization technique . Patient involvement registry shall influence treatment decision . Patients undergo complete diagnostic work include clinical neurological examination use National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score admission , laboratory examination , brain neurovascular imaging , echocardiography , 24-hours ECG determine stroke etiology use Trial Org 10172 Acute Stroke Treatment ( TOAST ) criterion . The treat physician initiate secondary prevention stroke soon possible . All patient examine CT CTA MRI MRA day 1 case clinical deterioration exclude intracranial haemorrhage assess recanalization occlude vessel ( use thrombolysis myocardial infarction ( TIMI ) grade system ) . Clinical outcome evaluate day 1 3 month use National Institute Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score , modify Rankin Scale score ( mRS ) , Barthel Index ( BI ) , assess adverse event quality life . The proportion patient favourable outcome ( mRS 0 2 ) 3 month IVT IAT serve primary outcome measure . In addition , subgroup analysis perform stratified NIHSS , location vessel occlusion , time hospital admission time treatment . Secondary outcome measure include quality life proportion patient excellent outcome ( mRS 0 1 ) 3 month , BI 75 100 3 month , mortality 3 month , rapid neurological improvement first 24 hour , complete partial recanalization , symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage .</detailed_description>
