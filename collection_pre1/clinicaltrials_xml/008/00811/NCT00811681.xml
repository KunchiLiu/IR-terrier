	<brief_title>Effect Pioglitazone Administered Patients With Friedreich 's Ataxia : Proof Concept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>State art Friedreich 's ataxia ( FA ) rare progressive neurological disorder affect approximately 1/30 , 000 individual . No treatment presently available counteract neurodegeneration extremely severe disease . The cardinal feature progressive gait limb ataxia . Other commonly associate clinical sign include : dysarthria , sensory loss , distal weakness , pyramidal sign , absent reflex , nystagmus cardiomyopathy . Pes cave , scoliosis , diabetes decline vision audition also find many patient . The disease often reveal adulthood lead progressive loss autonomy ten year disease onset . FA recessively inherit GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion first intron gene encode frataxin mitochondrial protein . Decreased frataxin lead mitochondrial iron-sulfur protein deficiency hamper signal pathway superoxide dismutases , key enzymes early antioxidant defence cell . As result , culture patient cell particularly sensitive oxidative insult . One aspect pathogenesis vivo might explain phenomenon . Pioglitazone , well know PPAR gamma ( peroxysome proliferators-activated receptor gamma ) ligand induces expression many enzyme involve mitochondrial metabolism , include superoxide dismutases . This agent may therapeutic counteract disabled recruitment antioxidant enzyme FA patient . This potential neuroprotective agent cross brain blood barrier human . A clinical study show daily treatment Pioglitazone three year induce apparent clinical improvement without adverse event multiple sclerosis patient . Pioglitazone show possibly act neurodegeneration human animal model thus appear promising agent test Friedreich ataxia . This agent also n't show peculiar toxicity culture human cell low frataxin compare control . All fact lead u propose clinical trial Pioglitazone patient FA . . Primary objective : To explore effect Pioglitazone neurological function FA patient . We expect neurological benefit take account natural course disease . Population : Subjects study limited patient older 25 year Methodology : Prospective , randomized double-blind trial Pioglitazone versus placebo FA patient . Patients treat two year undergo clinical exam test three day six month clinical investigation centre . Patients number justification : 20 patient group enrol study consideration inclusion possibility Bayes statistical analysis methodology . Evaluation prior distribution success probability per arm base previous literature data expert consensus . Primary endpoint : change neurological testing perform use International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale ( ICARS ) settle World Federation Neurology . Success define stabilisation improvement ICARS design 2 point maximum increment scale two year . Secondary endpoint include measurement follow : Neurological score Friedreich 's Ataxia Rating Scale ( FARS ) , gait record analysis component , posture study , kinetic study upper limb , speech , oculomotor auditory disorder , functional handicap use Disability Status Scale ( DSS ) , quality life SF-36 score ; Cardiac involvement ( electrocardiography , 24 hour holter , echocardiography tissue doppler ) drug tolerance . Benefits expect clinical trial : Expected result reduce symptoms stabilization natural evolution threat full progressive disease bad prognosis patient treat Pioglitazone . Furthermore , study result possibly contribute validation standardization new clinical evaluation tool use follow-up Friedreich ataxia patient . Specific monitoring initiated patient include study take account potential risk bladder cancer . All patient include protocol ACTFRIE , ask participate study tolerance . They receive pioglitazone dose 45 mg per day , data effectiveness otherwise treatment , side effect patient Friedreich 's ataxia know result ACTFRIE test ( approximately April 2014 ) .</detailed_description>
