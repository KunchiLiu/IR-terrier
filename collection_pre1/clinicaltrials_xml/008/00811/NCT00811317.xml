	<brief_summary>We hypothesize integrated closed-loop glucose-control system provide effective , tight , safe blood glucose ( BG ) control type 1 diabetes , thereby establish feasibility closed-loop BG control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closed-loop Glucose Control Automated Management Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate utility integrate closed-loop glucose-control system regulate BG type 1 diabetic subject . The closed-loop system utilizes sub-cutaneous infusion insulin glucagon control computer algorithm . The inputs algorithm subject weight BG value measure every five minute . Subjects undergo three 27 hour GCRC admission consume three standardized meal . Subject may participate two closed-loop visit ( different insulin lispro pharmacokinetic parameter setting control algorithm ) subject participate open-loop visit . During closed-loop admission BG control closed-loop system . During open-loop visit subject regulate BG usual function use insulin pump . A small group non-diabetic subject undergo single 27 hour GCRC admission eat standardized meal . During admission BG measure every 5 minute blood collect measurement insulin glucagon level every 10 minute . During closed-loop admission diabetic subject single admission non-diabetic subject , three commercially available continuous glucose monitoring device wear . The data device later compare reference BG data .</detailed_description>
