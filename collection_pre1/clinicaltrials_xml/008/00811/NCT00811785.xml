	<brief_summary>Menkes disease occipital horn syndrome two form copper deficiency must diagnose treat early life prevent serious developmental problem . However , form copper deficiency well understood , research need determine whether certain treatment useful treat copper deficiency . One treatment copper histidine , copper replacement inject directly body avoid absorption gastrointestinal tract . This study investigate effectiveness , side effect , dosage copper histidine treatment patient copper deficiency . It also collect medical history information patient allow researcher study possible genetic nongenetic origin copper deficiency . This study include 100 subject , child adult diagnose Menkes disease , occipital horn syndrome , unexplained copper deficiency . Patients receive prescribe dose copper histidine , administer daily injection . During study , patient admit NIH Clinical Center outpatient basis evaluate response copper histidine treatment . These evaluation take place every 8 month , final evaluation perform 3 year treatment . During outpatient visit , patient require give blood urine sample test undergo ultrasound test . They also undergo brain MRI scan initial visit 16-month 36-month visit . Patients agree give additional blood sample genetic research purpose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Menkes fatal genetic form copper deficiency cause mutation copper-transporting ATPase ( ATP7A ) . Pre-symptomatic diagnosis therapy copper injection associate improved overall survival , base molecular defect , vastly well neurological outcome patient compare usual natural history . One purpose study evaluate relationship specific molecular defect clinical response early copper treatment Menkes disease . In addition , seek study influence parenteral copper treatment relate genetic disorder , unexplained copper deficiency condition , often associate non-specific neurological abnormality .</detailed_description>
