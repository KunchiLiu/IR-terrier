	<brief_title>Evaluation Alternative Antimalarial Drugs Malaria Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current recommendation World Health Organization ( WHO ) prevent malaria infection pregnancy area stable malaria transmission relies : - Prompt effective case management malaria illness - The use intermittent preventive treatment ( IPTp ) least 2 treatment dos sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) - The use insecticide treat net ( ITNs ) However , spread parasite resistance SP , particularly eastern Africa , significant overlap region malaria transmission high prevalence HIV infection , raise concern medium long-term use SP IPTp . HIV infection increase susceptibility malaria may reduce efficacy intervention . The evaluation alternative antimalarial IPTp thus urgently need also involve HIV infected woman . Of current available alternative antimalarial drug , mefloquine ( MQ ) one offer comparative advantage SP . A randomized multicenter trial conduct 4 site Africa ( Benin , Gabon , Tanzania Mozambique ) order compare safety efficacy SP versus MQ IPTp context ITNs . In addition , MQ tolerability also evaluate compare administration MQ single intake administration split dose two day . In total 4716 pregnant woman enrol antenatal clinic ( ANC ) follow infant one year old . Besides , country HIV prevalence pregnant woman &gt; 10 % , MQ-IPTp compare Placebo-IPTp HIV infect pregnant woman receive cotrimoxazole ( CTX ) prophylaxis . This trial double blind carry Kenya , Tanzania Mozambique . It involve 1070 pregnant woman follow infant 2 month old .</detailed_description>
