	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Optimal Timing Antibiotic Prophylaxis Time Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly fifty year pass since Burke et al first demonstrate animal model reduction infection rate contaminate skin incision administration antibiotic prophylaxis . Further research area confirm benefit prophylactic antibiotic human subject . Patients develop surgical infection 60 % likely spend time intensive care unit , five time likely readmitted hospital , twice mortality rate compare patient without infection . As result potential health care cost stagger . Recently , National Surgical Infection Prevention Project endorse recommendation antibiotic prophylaxis administer within 60 minute skin incision . This model universally accept surgical field exception obstetrics . Cesarean delivery show important risk factor post-partum maternal infection . In fact , woman undergo cesarean delivery five twenty-fold great risk develop infection compare undergoing vaginal delivery . Recent review Cochrane Database find inconsistent variable application current recommendation regard appropriate timing , administration choice drug use antibiotic prophylaxis time cesarean delivery . Cesarean section hold unique position amongst surgical procedure one prophylactic antibiotic administer incision make . The concern intrapartum fetal exposure prophylactic antibiotic suppress microbial growth thereby mask neonatal sepsis lead tradition delay antibiotic administration umbilical cord clamping . While recent study demonstrate antibiotic level indeed reach therapeutic level within cord blood quickly administration mother , adverse outcome newborns ever document result . To date four study look time prophylactic administration time cesarean section . In 1982 , Cunningham et al randomize 642 woman `` high risk infection follow cesarean delivery '' receive antibiotic cord clamping . The author demonstrate difference uterine infection rate two group . While significantly infant expose intrapartum maternal antibiotic evaluate sepsis , case neonatal bacteremia either group . However , note pediatrician study fully aware whether antibiotic give cord clamp . Wax et al revisited issue randomize 90 consecutive term woman labor receive cefazolin preoperatively skin incision . While author fail show statistical significance two group , study clearly underpowered four case achieve primary outcome . Furthermore , author fail demonstrate significant increase suspect sepsis newborn whose mother receive cefazolin preoperatively . In 2005 , Thigpen et al demonstrated disadvantage infant regard infectious morbidity . In addition , difference maternal infectious morbidity regardless antibiotic administer . However , result questionable nearly quarter subject receive penicillin GBS prophylaxis . Finally , Sullivan include 357 woman well design randomize , double-blinded study demonstrate statistically significant reduction maternal infectious morbidity antibiotic administer preoperatively . Not difference two group regard neonatal infection , actually significantly few NICU admission day preoperative antibiotic group . Despite evidence preoperative prophylactic antibiotic pose harm fetus , obstetrics slow adopt practice . It wonder cesarean infection rate show considerably higher comparable surgical procedure . While evidence clearly demonstrate absence negative impact preoperative antibiotic neonatal outcome , contemporary scientific evaluation reduction maternal infectious morbidity warrant adopt practice universal basis .</detailed_description>
