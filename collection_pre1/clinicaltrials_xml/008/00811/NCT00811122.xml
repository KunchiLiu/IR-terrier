	<brief_title>Biodistribution 11C-PIB PET Alzheimer 's Disease , Frontotemporal Dementia , Cognitively Normal Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biomarkers Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) recently become extremely important number reason : improve diagnosis , measure severity disease , measure progression disease , measure effect novel disease-modifying drug speed development novel experimental drug reduce time need follow patient , number patient follow per study , cost research . ( Thal , 2006 , Nichols , 2006 ) The neuropathology AD characterize neuritic plaque , neurofibrillary tangle , neuronal cell loss ( Braak Braak , 1997 ) . Amyloid plaques believe play integral role AD ( Selkoe , 1993 ) . Plaques neurotoxic ( Yankner , 1989 ) . Elevated level Aβ brain correlate cognitive decline ( Naslund , 2000 ) . Removal plaques animal model AD result behavioral improvement ( Arendash , 2001 ) . There approved vivo marker amyloid load human . Several compound affinity bind amyloid vivo investigation . All compound use radioactive chemical tag positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging . Attempts find non-radioactive amyloid tracer underway , still poorly develop . The promising compound 11C-PIB . Pittsburgh Compound-B statistically significant increase retention AD cortical area , relative control ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . ( Price , 2005 ) To knowledge , 11C-PIB imaging compare frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) control . We recruit ( clinic population ) , total 30 subject , 10 follow 3 diagnostic category : frontotemporal dementia , Alzheimer 's disease , normal volunteer . All subject give FDG-PET scan ( n't one past ) PIB-PET scan . Objective Hypothesis : The overall objective project study biodistribution 11C-PIB use PET image normal elderly volunteer relevant patient group . Comparison FDG-PET essential confirm group membership anatomic co-registration 11C-PIB image . Specific Aim 1 : Determine biodistribution 11C-PIB AD , FTD , cognitively normal elderly individual determine whether reflect distribution amyloid plaque brain expect postmortem study . Hypothesis 1 : The agent 11C-PIB similar biodistribution outside brain AD , FTD , cognitively normal elderly individual . Hypothesis 2 : Patients AD scan 11C-PIB high standardized uptake value ( SUVs ) cognitively normal elderly brain region beta amyloid expect over-expressed . Hypothesis 3 : Patients FTD scan 11C-PIB similar standardize uptake value ( SUVs ) cognitively normal elderly subject low value AD subject brain region beta amyloid expect AD overexpressed . Specific Aim 2 : Correlate glucose metabolism 11C-PIB PET result . Hypothesis 4 : Patients pattern glucose hypometabolism suggestive FTD FDG-PET 11C-PIB uptake brain biodistribution similar cognitively normal elderly , pattern glucose hypometabolism suggestive AD abnormal PIB uptake brain biodistribution 11C-PIB</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All participant 3090 year old , inclusive , clinically characterize AD , FTD , cognitively normal control ( NC ) . 2 . All subject must willing able undergo test procedure . 3 . Cholinesterase inhibitor memantine symptomatic drug approve AD allow since drug expect significantly affect amyloid load . General inclusion criterion show : 1 . Normal subject : Healthy individual age match AD FTD group , nondepressed , nondemented , without complaint memory loss . A brief neuropsychological test , 3MSR Modified MiniMental State Examination , Revised ( Tschanz et al. , 2002 ) , give confirm subject cognitively impaired . 2 . FTD subject : Patients see University Utah ( UU ) Cognitive Disorders Clinic ( CDC ) clinically characterize meet Neary criterion frontotemporal dementia ( Neary et al. , 1998 ) . 3 . AD subject : Patients see UU CDC clinically characterize meet NINCDSADRDA criterion probable AD ( McKhann et al. , 1984 ) . These criterion establish 1984 diagnosis AD National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke ( NINCDS ) Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ( ADRDA ) . 1 . Subjects medical condition high risk associate cognitive symptom transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , stroke , seizure , head injury loss consciousness within five year 2 . Subjects Axis I psychiatric diagnosis treat depression 3 . Subjects medically stable exclude study . Examples medically unstable patient include uncontrolled hypertension , heart/liver/renal failure , condition require acute medical attention 4 . Subjects serum glucose level great 180 mg/dl FDGPET image 5 . Subjects claustrophobic undergo FDGPET 11C PIBPET image 6 . Subjects require conscious sedation anesthesia undergo FDGPET 11C PIBPET image 7 . Subjects unable follow instruction urinate complete scanning procedure</criteria>
