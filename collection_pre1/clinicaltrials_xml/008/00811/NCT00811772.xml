	<brief_summary>Stenosis coronary artery may treat balloon dilatation follow implantation metal stent . However , restenosis occur 10-20 % patient treat bare metal stent ( BMS ) . Restenosis treatment restenosis associate risk myocardial infarction ( MI ) death . Drug elute stent ( DES ) release drug vessel wall delay inhibit process restenosis . Some report find DES associate risk acute stent thrombosis , MI death . The precise magnitude risk know . Current evidence therefore insufficient balance long-term risk benefit BMS v DES . The purpose trial compare long-term effect MI total mortality BMS v DES . The trial recruit 8000 patient 8 Norwegian hospital . The patient randomize treatment BMS DES . Clinical event register 5 year treatment . The study hypothesis difference risk death myocardial infarction treatment BMS v DES . The trial initiate run university researcher sponsor not-for-profit organization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Drug Eluting Stent Versus Bare Metal Stent Treat Coronary Artery Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The balance long-term risk benefit coronary drug-eluting stent versus bare metal stent know . Study objective : The primary objective trial compare real-world set long-term effect incidence death myocardial infarction ( composite primary end-point ) implantation drug-eluting stent versus bare-metal stent . The secondary objective compare long-term effect incidence total death , cardiovascular death , major cardiovascular event , angina pectoris , revascularization procedure , health-related quality life implantation drug-eluting stent versus bare-metal stent . The main tertiary objective ass safety efficacy patient subgroup specific demographic , clinical , vessel- lesion characteristic , conduct cost-effectiveness analysis . Study design : This randomize , five-year prospective , multicenter , open-label clinical trial blind end point-evaluation . Setting : Investigator initiate trial conduct 8 Norwegian interventional centre . The trial sponsor Norwegian Research Council , Regional Health Authorities not-for-profit organization . Randomization : Patients randomize receive either drug-eluting stent ( ) bare-metal stent ( ) 1:1 ratio . Patients : The trial include 9000 patient de novo lesion native coronary artery by-pass graft meet eligibility criterion . Men woman stable angina pectoris acute coronary syndrome include . End-point : The primary composite end point total death nonfatal myocardial infarction.Secondary end-points include total death subcategories death , fatal nonfatal myocardial infarction , fatal nonfatal stroke , angina pectoris , revascularization , major bleeding , health-related quality life . Length follow-up : Five year . End-points collect electronic linkage national registry : The trial use unique Norwegian 11-digit person number search National Patient Registry National Death Registry nonfatal fatal end-points follow-up , thereby minimize loss follow-up . Information angina pectoris health-related quality life collect questionnaire . Statistical power : The trial statistical power 93 percent detect three percent ( RR 1.176 ) absolute difference incidence study group , power 64 percent detect two percent ( RR 1.118 ) absolute difference , give two-sided alpha value 0.05 . Statistical analysis : Statistical analysis conduct accord intention-to-treat principle , perform use widely accept statistical and/or graphical software . Data collection : Electronic Case Record Form ( e-CRF ) Clinical Event Committee : Adjudication end-points accord pre-specified standardized criterion Clinical Event Committee blind study assignment . Expected Timelines : First patient enrollment : September 2008 Last patient enrollment : February 2011 Completion Follow-up : December 2014 .</detailed_description>
