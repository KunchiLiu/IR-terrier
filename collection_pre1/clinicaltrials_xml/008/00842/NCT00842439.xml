	<brief_summary>Understanding joint neurobiological social base aggression critical future attempt tackle major public health problem . The overarching goal : ( ) conduct perhaps systematic integration biosocial risk factor childhood aggression order predict later aggression , ( b ) conduct one biosocial intervention childhood aggression , ( c ) predict treat two fundamentally different manifestation aggression proactive reactive aggression likely different etiology responsiveness treatment . The specific aim : ( 1 ) ass biological ( genetic , neurocognitive , brain imaging , neuroendocrinological , neurotoxin , psychophysiological , nutritional ) , psychosocial ( neighborhood , family , school , peer , psychological ) psychiatric ( ADHD , CD , ODD , depression , anxiety , PTSD , schizophrenia-spectrum ) risk factor male female aggression order well predict later aggression , ( 2 ) improve prediction identify genetic , neuroimaging , psychophysiological , neuroendocrinological factor protect child socially risk violence outcome , ( 3 ) develop genetic mouse model aggression test effectiveness nutritional intervention reduce aggression , ( 4 ) begin develop new biosocial approach treatment prevention aggression , base cognitive-behavioral nutrition intervention , ( 5 ) ass differential prediction treatment two fundamental variant child aggression : proactive reactive aggression . The human sample consist 500 male female 11-year-old child draw high-risk community Philadelphia . Three hundred participant engage baseline assessment risk factor aggression , randomly assign one four three-month intervention program : treatment-as-usual , cognitive-behavioral intervention , nutrition supplementation , CBI + nutrition . Aggression outcome assess throughout intervention post-intervention . The investigator believe biological risk factor interact social risk factor predict aggression , main effect class risk factor . Treatment effectiveness interact risk factor : low omega-3 high lead exposure intake benefit nutritional intervention ; cognitive affective risk factor benefit neuro-cognitive-behavioral intervention .</brief_summary>
