	<detailed_description>The purpose research determine relationship ( novel ) cardiac renal biomarkers angiography . Clearly , data immediately forewarn clinician cardiomyocyte injury occur , impend renal failure ahead would allow therapeutic intervention reduce likelihood severe complication , would ultimately pave way opportunity derive method well prevent complication . With rapid evolution organ-specific marker injury come opportunity explore new venue application . With respect myocardial injury , new highly sensitive troponin molecule test assay recently validate enables detect extremely small concentration troponin release circulation . With assay , may possible detect possible troponin release early minute injury occur . Accordingly , primary goal CASABLANCA study , examine release high sensitivity troponin assay catheterization correlate clinical standard biochemical measure order see gradient change catheterization would associate subsequent recognition peri-procedural myocardial infarction ; expectation ultra high-sensitivity troponin method allow nearly immediate recognition complication follow heart catheterization , compare standard , non-high sensitivity method currently use . With regard peri-procedural renal injury , present , several serum marker study potential marker predictor contrast induce nephropathy ( CIN ) : Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) highly accumulate kidney cortical tubule leak circulation nephrotoxic ischemic injury . Up-regulation neutrophil adhesion receptor CD11b also associate acute renal injury cardiac surgery , carbamylated hemoglobin perform quite well differentiate acute kidney injury elevate creatinine due chronic kidney disease . Finally , Cystatin-C show good accuracy early diagnosis acute kidney injury clinical diagnosis well . In addition , blood store future test novel experimental biomarkers 'bench-to-bedside ' collaboration , final yet crucial step translational research .</detailed_description>
