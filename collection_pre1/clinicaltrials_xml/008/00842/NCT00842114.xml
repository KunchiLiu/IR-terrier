	<brief_title>Rituximab CVP Plus Interferon Follicular Non Hodgkins Lymphoma ( NHL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multicentric trial evaluate efficacy CVP chemotherapy + Interferon ( IFN ) + Rituximab induction regimen patient age 18 75 year newly diagnose follicular NHL . Follicular non Hodgkin 's lymphoma 's ( FL ) , define REAL Classification , usually characterize slowly progressive clinical course , transient control standard chemotherapeutic regimen pattern repeat relapse ultimately progressive fatal disease . Most standard first line treatment advance FL consist alkylating-based ( CVP ) anthracycline contain regimen , association immunomodulating agent interferon alpha unconjugated chimeric anti-CD20 antibody ( rituximab ) target CD20 antigen highly express follicular lymphoma cell . This strategies significantly increase survival patient , relapse still occur . Thus , treatment patient FL , require improvement . IFN alpha antiproliferative immunomodulatory property . Moreover , describe synergistic effect IFN give chemotherapy . This association significantly improve progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . Our prior result 12 week IFN plus CVP induction treatment , significantly increase PFS compare CVP alone ( 60 % median PFS vs. 24 % , p : 0.0004 ) . We also perform prospective study analyze correlation duration remission MRD patient treat CVP+IFN . Ninety four percent patient molecular marker ( 60 % bcl-2 translocation 34 % IgH rearrangement ) . Molecular response , define achieve negative molecular MRD , achieve 76 % patient associated clinical remission . There also significant correlation duration remission sustain indetectable MRD Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ( Rituximab ) mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) , antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) apoptosis . Rituximab also show sensitize drug-resistant lymphoma cell line kill cytotoxic drug . There `` vitro '' study test effect Rituximab IFN combination . It 's described IFN give Rituximab , favour expression CD20 therefore increase cytotoxic effect - . Preliminary phase II study show increase response rate duration response go 12 month . Moreover , two clinical study test efficacy tolerability Rituximab add IFN-alpha vi- ix . The Nordic Lymphoma Group show significant increase ORR ( 94 % ) add 5 week IFN re-treatment 4 dos Rituximab patient achieve minimal partial remission . Most patient , maintain response 24 month . With similar trial design , Sacchi et al . show ORR 74 % ( 33 % CR ) median duration response 19 month . The combination safe grade 3-4 adverse event ( 15 % ) hematologic toxicity ( leuko-neutropenia thrombocytopenia ) . Thus , hypothesize combination rituximab , standard induction regimen use IFN plus CVP might lead synergistic / additive induction apoptosis different pathway poor prognostic patient FL , improve previous result . We also hypothesize combination able achieve high molecular remission , determine real-time PCR Bcl-2 translocation .</detailed_description>
