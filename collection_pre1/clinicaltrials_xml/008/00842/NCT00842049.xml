	<brief_summary>Subarachnoid haemorrhage affect approximately 8000 people per year UK . The average age patient subarachnoid haemorrhage 50 year , although often see young people ( 25-45 year ) . Despite modern medicine , death disability rate remain high initial bleed associate complication vasospasm . This characterised neurological impairment see follow bleed . Despite modern treatment still associate poor outcome . This significant implication due long term intensive neuro-rehabilitation patient require . A recent study show place small drain lower back follow subarachnoid haemorrhage may reduce chance vasospasm occur result well outcome . This trial optimally perform trial need look detail . The investigator set trial neurosurgical unit . If investigator confirm improvement patient outcome , change practice future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient present department proven aneurysmal SAH fit inclusion criterion ( see ) approach inclusion trial . Written inform consent seek prior recruitment study . Written assent patient 's relative seek case neurological impairment prevents write informed consent obtain patient . The patient subsequently randomise control arm study arm trial . The control arm consist normal therapeutic intervention , include external ventricular drainage require hydrocephalus . Those randomised therapeutic arm lumbar drain inserted set drain CSF 5 ml/hour . This continue CSF longer blood stained day 10 follow insertion . Primary outcome measure : 1 . Incidence delay ischaemic neurological deficit . This define new neurological deficit and/or impairment consciousness without identifiable cause least three day post haemorrhage . New impairment consciousness define drop Glasgow Coma Score 1 motor point 2 verbal/eye opening point . Secondary outcome measure : 1 . Modified Rankin Score day 10 post ictus 6 month . 2 . Severity delay neurological deficit development complete infarct . 3 . Incidence cerebrospinal fluid infection secondary lumbar drainage Special note : If patient present great three day follow initial bleed , neurological deficit present may delay neurological deficit thus must exclude trial . Should lumbar drain fall prematurely patient ask whether wish continue study , , lumbar drain reinserted management continue . Patients show sign lumbar drain infection drain remove , sample CSF drain tip send microbiology laboratory appropriate antibiotic therapy institute . The neurosurgical unit Leeds General Infirmary treat 313 patient acute subarachnoid haemorrhage three year 1997-2000 . Of 243 patient would suitable study basis admission clinical status . The power calculation derive estimate 40 % patient treated standard therapy develop clinical vasospasm . If retrospective study show minimum 20 % improvement outcome variable expect see improvement . For 85 % power require 105 patient arm . We expect take 3.5 year base number eligible patient present unit 60-70 % recruitment rate ( approximately 30 patient per year per arm ) .</detailed_description>
