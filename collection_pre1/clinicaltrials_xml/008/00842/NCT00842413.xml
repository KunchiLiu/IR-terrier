	<brief_summary>This project aim understand well role frontal lobe brain capacity perceive visual information consciously , also , capacity perceive others ' action . It include test ask subject detect visual information front computer screen , another test ask imitate finger movement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Role Premotor Cortex Higher Cognitive Functions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project twofold exploration function premotor cortex , concern , one hand , role conscious visual perception , hand , part may play perception imitation people 's movement . Healthy subject compare subject suffer focal lesion within premotor cortex , two task : first task , subject make decision concern absence presence visual item field vision . They make ( virtual ) bet base subjective certainty perception - tell bet purely virtual , result financial gain loss . This study help u understand contribution prefrontal cortex subjective weigh perceptual certainty . In second task , subject imitate finger movement , base either fixed picture , short motion picture . Previous study show whether movement copy fixed picture move picture change reaction time type mistake . Neuroimaging study show premotor area involve effect . The comparison brain-damaged healthy subject tell u exactly contribution prefrontal consists .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy subject choose pool adult subject , recruit ad . In second group , subject recruit pool braindamaged patient treated hospital de la PitiéSalpétrière . They must suffer focal lesion prefrontal cortex . For healthy group : previous brainrelated medical history . Widespread braindamage , extend beyond prefrontal cortex , say , lesion really focal .</criteria>
