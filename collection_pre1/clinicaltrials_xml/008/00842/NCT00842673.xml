	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) progressive fatal neurological illness . It produce change brain include loss cell accumulation abnormal protein deposit . Initial symptom cognitive , deficiencies short-term memory common symptom . As disease progress severity cognitive deficiency . Loss speech immobility occur terminal stage There cure AD market treatment modifies underlie disease process . Available therapy improve symptom AD increase brain concentration molecule involve cognition . ST101 differs market therapy demonstrate two action animal research testing . It improve cognition also reduce accumulation abnormal protein deposit brain . These two property suggest ST101 may promise agent treatment AD .
