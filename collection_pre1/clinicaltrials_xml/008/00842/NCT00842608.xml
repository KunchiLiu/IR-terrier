	<detailed_description>In 2005 , approximately 2.7 million Americans age 65 old spent least one day intensive care unit ( ICU ) , cost Medicare estimate $ 27.5 billion . It estimate hospitalize , 80 % old ICU patient delirium , acute brain failure independent predictor morbidity mortality often go unrecognized . Older adult delirium prone fall , injury , pressure ulcer restraint , complication may also contribute prolonged ICU hospital length stay , high mortality rate , poor functional status , limited rehabilitation , increased institutionalization , high health care cost . The literature support treatment combination reduction use benzodiazepine anticholinergic use low-dose neuroleptic haloperidol . However , randomize control trial evaluate efficacy approach reduce delirium severity , duration , complication . Building upon e-CHAMP study , ( `` Enhancing Care Hospitalized Older Adults With Memory Problems ; '' see NCT00182832 ) , recently complete quality improvement project test effectiveness cognitive screening couple computerized decision support reduce delirium hospital-related complication among 424 old adult hospitalize medical ward , find many old adult enter study already experience delirium ICU prior transfer ward . This study test pharmacologic intervention allow target approach care old adult delirium still recognize clinician ' role control symptom provide intensive care . The hypothesis patient intervention arm compare usual care : - reduce delirium severity , measure Delirium Rating Scale ( DRS-R-98 ) , one week follow randomization hospital discharge - few hospital day delirium coma determine Confusion Assessment Method ICU ( CAM-ICU ) - short hospital length stay - low ICU , hospital , 30-day mortality</detailed_description>
