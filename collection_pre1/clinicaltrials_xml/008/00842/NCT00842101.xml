	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect ream intramedullary nail tibial shaft fracture ( standard treatment ) , raise intracompartmental pressure therefore determine risk factor compartmental syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compartmental Overpressures Associated Reamed Intramedullary Nails</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compartmental overpressure serious problem relation treatment tibial shaft fracture . When reamed intramedullary nail use , risk suffer compartmental syndrome must mind surgeon . Diagnostic compartmental syndrome could difficult surgical intervention , patient condition regional anesthesia opioids analgesic , could mask symptomatology . In fact , great suspicion syndrome , recommend measure compartmental pressure ; therefore , physician might apply term delta-P value , result mean arterial pressure minus compartmental pressure . If one less 30 mm Hg , fasciotomy perform even clinical diagnostic clear .</detailed_description>
