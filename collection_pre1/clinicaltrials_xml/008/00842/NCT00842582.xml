	<brief_summary>This clinical trial woman newly diagnose ovarian cancer . The purpose study determine addition drug call azacitidine ( VidazaÂ® ) add carboplatin paclitaxel change genetic material tumor chemotherapy drug work well . The study also determine maximum tolerate dose azacitidine may safely use combination carboplatin paclitaxel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine With Carboplatin Paclitaxel Newly Diagnosed Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer highly chemosensitive tumor good response first line chemotherapy . The problem high rate relapse , especially advanced disease Relapses likely due presence chemoresistant cell escape first line platinum taxane base regimen . Therefore , outcome may improve add treatment initial standard therapy make resistant cell sensitive chemotherapy . There multiple target pathway may achieve goal . One promise path epigenetics . The reason trial multifold . First , methylation pathway proven tissue model integral ovarian cancer pathogenesis . Second , cisplatin azacitidine synergistic , therefore would promise combination improve ovarian cancer outcome combat cisplatin resistance , major cause ovarian cancer mortality . It proven azacitidine/decitabine revers platinum resistance . Third , azacitidine show tolerable toxicity promise clinical trial date . Ideally , ovarian cancer outcome likely improve addition treatment wipe chemoresistant cell , thus prevent relapse . This study phase I , non-randomized , dose escalation treatment study use azacitidine combination intravenous chemotherapy Paclitaxel carboplatin . All patient receive chemotherapy drug Carboplatin Paclitaxel . Patients randomize receive one three different dos Azacitidine .</detailed_description>
