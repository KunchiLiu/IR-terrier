	<brief_summary>In present project , role heme oxygenase 1 2 procesess associate fibroproduction chronic HCV infection study . Heme oxygenase expression evaluate technique molecular genetics immunohistochemistry , liver tissue peripheral blood mononuclear cell . These parameter correlate basic virological clinical characteristic chronic HCV infection . The investigator ' expect result may help understand mechanisms fibroproduction chronic HVC infection , therefore , contribute explain individual difference development chronic HCV infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Heme Oxygenase Pathogenesis Hepatocellular Injury Chronic Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) single strand positive RNA virus belong Flaviviridae family . HCV major cause chronic hepatitis progressive liver fibrosis lead cirrhosis . Currently , mechanisms responsible hepatocellular injury fully understood . Oxidative damage hypothesize play role HCV-induced liver disease , reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , generate HCV-infected hepatocytes infiltrate immune cell . Persistence recurrent hepatocellular injury lead wound-healing process oxidative stress , inflammatory response mediate immune cell and/or cytokine , activation hepatic stellate cell ( HSCs ) contribute cascade fibrogenesis . HCV infect peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) patient chronic HCV infection . PBMC play key role innate adaptive antigen-specific immunity constitute critical component immune response.Heme oxygenase ( HO ) rate-limiting enzyme heme catabolic pathway . It cleave pro-oxidant heme equimolar amount carbon monoxide ( CO ) , free iron , biliverdin , rapidly metabolize bilirubin biliverdin reductase.The human HO-1 gene locate chromosome 22q12 variable number tandem repeat polymorphism ( VNTR ) identify proximal promoter region . It suggest highly polymorphic ( GT ) n repeat could alter transcriptional activity . In recent year , enhance HO enzymatic activity report - probably formation bioactive product - posse antioxidant , cytoprotective , neurotransmitter activity play role anti-inflammatory function . AIMS : AIM 1.To characterize HO expression liver biopsies patient chronic hepatitis C compare expression patient type hepatitis ( esp . autoimmune ) normal liver tissue . To investigate relationship HO expression hepatitis C virus concentration , duration infection , level fibrosis inflammation , ALT , AST activity , bilirubin level , response standard treatment level apoptosis . AIM 2 . To characterize HO expression PBMC patient chronic hepatitis C , week 12 standard treatment ( PEG-IFN+RBV ) . To correlate HO expression PBMC viral concentration serum response standard treatment.AIM 3 . To investigate HO polymorphisms patient chronic hepatitis C. AIM 4 . To investigate UGT1A1 28 polymorphism responsible benign hyperbilirubinemia . Expected result : 1 . This study could elucidate relationship development liver fibrosis inflammation HO expression . 2 . This project may , first time , show relationship chronic HCV infection regulation HO expression PBMC . 3.This project answer question whether genetic predisposition , length polymorphism HO promoter responsible low transcriptional activity , could risk factor fibrosis/cirrhosis development patient infect hepatitis C virus . UGT1A1 28 polymorphism connect low prevalence disease oxidative stress increase . We suggest HCV infect person might low prevalence polymorphism polymorphism might connect low efficacy antiviral treatment person .</detailed_description>
