	<brief_summary>The purpose study , first clinical trial JI-101 , determine maximum tolerate dose JI-101 give orally patient solid tumor . Safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , effect drug tumor metabolism also study . JI-101 inhibitor new blood vessel growth may provide benefit patient solid tumor fail standard therapeutic regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 , Open-Label , Dose-Escalation Study JI-101 , Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>JI-101 compound develop treatment patient solid tumor ; specifically patient approve therapy standard care available solid tumor fail standard care therapy . JI-101 inhibitor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta ( PDGFRβ ) , EphB4 receptor , play important role drive vascularization ( angiogenesis vasculogenesis ) normal development tumorigenesis . JI-101 inhibits growth new blood vessel , turn , may slow prevent growth tumor . The purpose open label study treat patient advance solid tumor , increase dos JI-101 , thereby provide information maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The study also examine safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , may evaluate effect drug tumor metabolism . During dose-escalation study , least two patient dose dose level ( cohort ) . The patient must complete 21 day dose safety result review prior patient assign next high dose level . A continuous reassessment method utilized escalate JI-101 dos cohort . Doses increase , anticipated high dose 800mg per day . If MTD reach , optimal biologic dose ( OBD ) determine base high dos tolerable acceptable efficacy . The cohort MTD OBD expand include 30 patient solid tumor explore safety tolerability orally-administered JI-101 .</detailed_description>
