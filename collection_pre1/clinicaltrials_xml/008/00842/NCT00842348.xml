	<brief_summary>The primary purpose extension study assess long term safety patient nonfunctioning enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumour ( NET ) , treat open label lanreotide Autogel ( 120 mg every 28 day ) participate previous study , 2-55-52030-726 ( NCT00353496 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Lanreotide Autogel 120 mg Patients With Non-functioning Entero- Pancreatic Endocrine Tumour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While somatostatin analogue treatment primary medical therapy patient hormone relate symptom indicate treatment hormone relate symptom many international country , reference standard medical therapy asymptomatic patient . A 96-week study ( Study 2-55-52030-726 ( 726 ) , NCT00353496 ) conduct investigate effect lanreotide Autogel progression free survival ( PFS ) patient well moderately differentiate nonfunctioning enteropancreatic NET . While Study 726 ongoing , sponsor consider therapy lanreotide Autogel continue option patient stable disease end 96-week treatment period . This extension study therefore initiate ( Study 2-55-52030-729 ( 729 ) ) investigate long term safety treatment lanreotide Autogel enable investigator continue treat patient stable disease , well treat placebo patient experience disease progression initial 96-week study ( Study 726 ) .</detailed_description>
