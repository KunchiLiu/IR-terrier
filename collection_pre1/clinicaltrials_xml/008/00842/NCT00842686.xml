	<brief_summary>The use preoperative chemoradiation adjuvant chemotherapy 5-FU base chemotherapy reduce local recurrence rate le 10 % , limited effect overall survival due constantly high ( 30 % ) rate distant metastasis . However , show complete eradication primary tumour observe histopathological specimen ( pathological complete response , pCR ) correlate favourable overall prognosis obtain pCR might beneficial . The aim study investigate whether addition bevacizumab preoperative fluoropyrimidinebased chemoradiation improve pathological complete remission rate locally advance rectal cancer acceptable toxicity . Secondary objective evaluate pathological downstaging rate , histopathological R0 resection rate , sphincter preservation rate , perioperative surgical complication rate , local control , DFS , OS , late toxicity quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- radiotherapy : 45 Gy pelvis ( 25x 1.8 Gy day 1-33 , exclude weekend ) plus 5.4 Gy day 36-38 boost primary tumour ( 3 fraction 1.8 Gy ) .Three- dimensional CT plan four field box technique high energy photon ( 15 MV ) use . All field treat daily . Multileaf collimator use shape individual radiation field . Patients irradiate prone position full bladder use belly board minimize exposure small bowel . - capecitabine 825 mg/m² p.o . twice daily day 1-38 ( include weekend ) , - bevacizumab : dose 5 mg/kg day -14 , 2 , 16,30 . - Radical surgery ( TME ) : undertaken ideally 6-8 week follow completion chemoradiation . Postoperative treatment ( patient achieve histopathological R0 R1 resection ) : capecitabine 1250 mg/m² p.o . twice daily 14 consecutive day every three week ; 4 cycle ( R0 ) 6 cycle ( R1 ) begin 6-8 week surgery</detailed_description>
