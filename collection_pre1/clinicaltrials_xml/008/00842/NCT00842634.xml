	<brief_summary>This research study carry study new way possibly treat HIV . This agent call `` Zinc Finger Nuclease '' ZFN short . ZFNs proteins delete another protein name CCR5 . This CCR5 protein require certain common type HIV ( CCR5 tropic ) enter infect T-cells . T-cells one white blood cell use body fight HIV . The important T-cells call `` CD4 T-cells . '' Some people bear without CCR5 T-cells . These people remain healthy resistant infection HIV . Other people low number CCR5 T-cells , HIV disease less severe slow cause disease ( AIDS ) . In order delete CCR5 protein T cell , study isolate large number T-cells subject , deliver ZFNs use delivery vehicle call viral vector . The viral vector use study call adenoviral vector . The vector add cell begin manufacture process ZFNs knock CCR5 protein . By time T-cells return subject , minimal adenovirus ZFN present . The removal CCR5 protein T-cells subject receive , however , permanent . The purpose research study find whether `` zinc finger '' modify T-cells 1. safe give human 2. find `` zinc finger '' modify T cell affect HIV This experimental study . Laboratory study show CD4 T-cells modify `` zinc finger '' , HIV prevent kill CD4 T cell . On basis laboratory result , potential `` zinc finger '' may work human infected HIV improve immune system allow CD4 T-cells survive longer ( HIV usually kill T cell infects ) . All subject receive ZFN Modified CD4+T cell enroll Long Term , Follow-up study monitor subject . Subjects follow every 3 month four year . If ZFN Modified CD4+T cell longer find blood four year , subject contact yearly next 6 year . If ZFN Modified CD4+T cell find blood year four , subject continue see year ZFN Modified CD4+T cell longer find blood maximum 10 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cohort 1 - Patients fail two HAART regimen ( 6 subject ) Cohort 2 - Patients well stable antiretroviral medication ( 6 subject ) Cohort 3 - Patients undetectable viral load HAART exhibit suboptimal CD4+ T cell gain long term antiretroviral therapy . This group participate structure treatment interruption . ( 6 subject ) 1 . Eligibility : Physical Exam , Medical History , Blood Draws clinical lab research . 2 . 1st Procedure collect T cell ( call apheresis ) 3 . 2nd Procedure collect T cell ( call apheresis occur ~3 week 1st Apheresis ) Rectal Biopsy 4 . Clinic visit : Physical Exam , Blood Draw clinical lab research ( ~1 2 week 2nd Apheresis ) 5 . Infusion ZFN modify T cell ( ~2weeks Clinic Visit ) Cohort 1 Cohort 3 : 6 . Follow Clinic Visits 48 , 72 hour ; 1,2,3,6 week ; 2,3,6 , 9 month ZFN infusion . Cohort 2 Only : 6 . Stop Antiretroviral Medications 4 Weeks ZFN modify T cell Infusion . 7 . Follow-up Clinic Visits 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , week ZFN modify T cell Infusion . 8 . Restart Antiretroviral Medications 20 week ZFN modify T cell Infusion . 9 . Follow-up Clinic Visits : monthly visit detectable HIV find blood .</detailed_description>
