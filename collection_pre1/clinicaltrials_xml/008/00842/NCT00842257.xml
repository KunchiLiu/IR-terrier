	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn whether panitumumab help treat colorectal cancer participant respond treatment cetuximab . Panitumumab human monoclonal antibody . Antibodies proteins recognize foreign substance body attach make expose destruction . Panitumumab attach protein cancer cell call `` epidermal growth factor receptor '' EGFR . EGFR help cancer cell grow , block EGFR help prevent cancer cell grow .</brief_summary>
