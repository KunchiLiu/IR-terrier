	<detailed_description>This treatment study also provide u opportunity explore molecular genetics BDD , well genetic predictor response extinction-based treatment . We take hypothesis-driven approach focus gene system previously show mediate fear acquisition NMDA-dependent extinction learn include NMDA-related glutamatergic locus ( GRIN1 , GRIN2A , GRIN2B , DAAO , DAOA ) three gene strongly implicate fear extinction ( BDNF , NTRK2 , CNR1 ) . Other loci interest molecular genetics BDD include : serotonin transporter gene , dopamine , GABA-A , cytochrome P450 gene .</detailed_description>
