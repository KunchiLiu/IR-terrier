	<brief_summary>Long term effect treatment childhood obesity well document grow evidence parental involvement behavioral change strong predictor child weight loss . However , form content parental involvement effective study . In present randomize control study compare effect parent manualized group treatment ( `` experimental group '' ) effect parent self-help group change child Body Mass Index , food intake , physical activity , quality life self esteem . We pose follow hypothesis : 1 . Parents participate experimental group child achieve large reduction BMI child parent control group . 2 . This treatment effect mediate change one several element parent ' cognition : outcome expectancy , perceive control , perceive value outcome , self-efficacy , perceive reduction barrier , subjective norm . 3 . Reduction BMI correlate increase quality life , reduce number severity mental health problem , increase self-concept .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Childhood Obesity : Study Group Treatment Targeting Parents Behaviour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity increase dramatically substantial part world last decade , weight increase also see child . This epidemic also reach Norway , worry increase prevalence overweight obese school age child . Reports US study show substantial increase diabetes II among overweight child . Such increase currently detect among Norwegian child . However , increase childhood obesity continue worsens , expect onset weight relate disorder Diabetes II Cardio-vascular take place earlier life . In addition , would expect increase psychosocial problem ( poor self-concept , social isolation ) psychiatric symptom disorder associate obesity ( e.g . eat problem depression ) . Hence , preventive treatment effort call . Parents need include The treatment obesity among child traditionally address child mean diet exercise , often involve in-patient treatment . Slowly , evidence concern importance include parent treatment emerge well need address child 's wider social context . Hence , childhood obesity first foremost conceived behavioral problem . Generally , behaviorally orient approach emerge successful . Such behavioral procedure conduct within framework individual consultation child/family . It report family orient behavioral treatment 30 % previously overweight child longer qualified overweight , whereas 34 % sustain minimum 20 % reduction overweight . The best predictor long term course overweight reduction family eat exercise environment , addition support friend family . Notably , intervention group target child parent fare best . Such finding concurs conclusion family parent base approach associated weight loss among obese child . Less known concern specific effective parental involvement , form parental involvement effective content effective intervention . Therapies target individual family costly undertake time consume family . We therefore need balance benefit family treatment cost , aim optimal intervention level provide best therapeutic result low degree investment . We therefore adopt group treatment paradigm . Lessons learn treatment childhood behavioral problem . Moreover , intervention within pediatric obesity surprisingly little extent drawn upon mount knowledge successful intervention regard type childhood behavioral problem , e.g . conduct problem . Such intervention generally try strengthen general parenting practice ( e.g . limit setting , consistency , anger management , affective availability ) order increase parent ' competency regulate child 's problem behavior . The behavioral technique traditional obesity intervention program try get parent adapt home ( e.g . get child exercise eat small portion ) seem require basic parenting skill . When parent fall short actually learn , may due fact regard eat physical activity , behavior obese child especially demand put parent skill test . Hence , specific train skills increase likelihood behavioral change parent child include intervention program . In , manualized treatment encourage order facilitate replication clinical use , often leave want . Although exception exist , many study include short-term post-treatment outcome . Thus , child need follow long time period , due fact short-term weight reduction achieve numerous intervention strategy , whereas long-term weight reduction primary goal . Lessons learn general model health behavior Within preventive framework several theoretical model devise pinpoint cognitive social factor determine health promote behavior , also include health behavior important development adiposity childhood . The predictive power model determine future health behavior high , also eat physical activity child adolescent consider . Such basic knowledge limit extent integrate treatment model obesity childhood . We hence aim target behavior parent may facilitate health promote behavior offspring . Numerous model health behavior exist . Their construct overlap extent , merit . Our vantage point therefore arguably widely accept model health behavior , namely Ajzen 's Theory Planned Behavior , supplement barrier towards health promote behavior element stem `` Health Belief Model '' Bandura 's concept self-efficacy ( 1977 ) , viz . person 's belief her/his ability perform behavior question . Figure 1 depicts theoretical model content parent base group intervention program . In addition , expect weight reduction imply additional positive outcome child include increased quality life , increase self-concept reduction psychiatric symptom . However , expect characteristic child may moderate effect intervention . The consideration imply treatment program childhood obesity : 1 . Aim endure life-style change respect eat physical activity . The treatment target family member ' habit cognition . Low intensity intervention one applicable practical context , program demand less extensive effort change family 's way living , one also potential success long run . 2 . Target child 's behavior mean involve parent . We contend effective parent regulate child 's eat exercise behavior health personnel try directly treat child . Parents thus regulate stimulus condition govern child 's eat exercise behavior reduce cue possibility excessive intake fattening food , increase cue opportunity physical activity healthy eating . 3 . Strengthen general specific parent skill . Teaching parent importance healthy eating , meal preparation , physical activity enough achieve endure effect . The main challenge parent know , rather actually able carry behavior front challenge barrier ( e.g . bereave opportunity snack ; guilt-inducing behavior child ) . By address behavior teach specific skill overcome barrier , parent may learn new parent skill alter condition child 's behavior long-term perspective . 4 . Target parent ' cognition effect behavior . The treatment address cognition maintain weight relate behavior towards child . These cognition outline Figure 1 . 5 . Treat parent group . Group treatments cost-effective . In addition , parent obese child may learn experience parent , may provide emotional social support . Finally , social control element report completion failure perform homework session underestimate . However , order secure need family/child met , individual session include weight control schedule . 6 . Focus mastery solution . In order promote treatment optimism treatment address family actually achieve expense failure . At present little knowledge demographic psychosocial characteristic clinic-referred child adiposity Norway . We provide descriptive information population concern medical condition nutritional status , well psychological factor potential psychiatric symptom associate overweight . Moreover , address issue whether successful treatment also alleviate psychosocial problem self-concept problem increase quality life . Finally , ask whether weight reduction child associate change parent ' health belief , whether expect change parental health belief mediate effect intervention .</detailed_description>
