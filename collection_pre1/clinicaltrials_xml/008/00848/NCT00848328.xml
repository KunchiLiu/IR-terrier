	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving lenalidomide together rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give lenalidomide together rituximab work treat patient follicular small lymphocytic non-Hodgkin lymphoma relapse responded treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Rituximab Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine response rate patient relapse refractory follicular small lymphocytic non-Hodgkin lymphoma treat lenalidomide rituximab . Secondary - To determine time disease progression , duration response , overall survival patient . - To determine tolerability regimen patient . - To assess change serum cytokine treatment correlate change response . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive rituximab IV day 15 22 course 1 day 1 8 course 2 . Patients achieve complete response 2 course rituximab may receive 4 additional dos rituximab weekly 4 week . Blood sample collect baseline treatment cytokine analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
