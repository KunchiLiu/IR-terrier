	<brief_summary>Refinements laparoscopic surgery , couple advancement therapeutic flexible endoscopy , set stage surgery move even less invasive technique treat condition GI tract peritoneal cavity . Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) offer mean reduce ultimately eliminate need abdominal incision gain access peritoneal cavity . In NOTES , flexible endoscope accessory instrument inserted natural body orifice pass wall organ reach abdominal cavity . By reduce eliminate need abdominal incision , NOTES may provide least invasive surgical option reduce pain , recovery time , complication , systemic inflammatory response compare laparoscopic surgical approach . In study , propose use NOTES technique eliminate need 1.5-2.5 cm umbilical incision . Hypothesis 1 : We hypothesize combined endoscopic laparoscopic approach able eliminate 1.5 2.5 cm infraumbilical incision perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Hypothesis 2 : Closure gastrotomy facilitate Ethicon TAS system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , propose use surgical technique eliminates need 1.5-2.5 cm umbilical incision . All patient receive pre-operative antibiotic . A Veress needle use create pneumoperitoneum insufflation carbon dioxide gas standard laparoscopic insufflator . A 5 mm laparoscopic port insert abdominal wall right mid-abdomen 5 mm laparoscope insert view abdominal cavity . A flexible endoscope , position within multi-lumen 18 mm therapeutic access device , insert mouth stomach . Using commercially available endoscope , endoscopic instrument accessory , small incision make gastric wall endoscope advance insufflated peritoneal cavity . Additional laparoscopic trocars may place abdominal wall laparoscopic instrument insertion manipulate , retract cut tissue . The flexible endoscope provide visualization surgical field flexible endoscopic instrument may use augment surgical manipulation laparoscopic instrument . Intraoperative cholangiogram laparoscopic ultrasound perform discretion surgeon . Once dissected free , gallbladder remove stomach mouth aid endoscopic retrieval bag . Commercially available endoscopic clip , FDA approve tissue anchor use close gastrotomy . Additionally , gastrotomy closure test leak laparoscopically oversewn suture . Operative recovery room time well hospital length stay collect . During hospital stay , severity pain , use pain medication complication record . Patients discharge per standard practice laparoscopic cholecystectomy . All study patient receive call surgery clinic nurse post-op day 2 7 . We develop check list contain follow ( yes/no ) element use prior discharge , post-op day 2 7 phone call , 2 week post-op clinic visit : pain control med , nausea , emesis , fever , chill , redness incision , drainage incision , shortness breath , chest pain , yellow eye , dark urine , clay-colored stool . If `` yes '' response checklist prior discharge , patient discharge hospital . If `` yes '' response checklist post-op day 2 7 phone call , patient advise immediately come GI surgery clinic go near emergency room . If `` yes '' response checklist 2 week clinic visit , patient undergo necessary standard care medical evaluation ( labs , test , etc . ) may admit hospital . These checklist review one investigator , collect store lock file cabinet . Patients return evaluate surgeon two week follow procedure . At visit , post-operative complication note patient 's medical record . Additionally visit preoperative visit , patient complete standardize Quality Life ( QOL ) assessment ( i.e. , SF-36 ) . Perceived pain level type frequency pain medication record patient 's medical record . The potential advantage patient enter study include mention regard elimination post-operative wound infection hernia also lack abdominal incision great 5 mm length may reduce pain recovery time likely cosmetic advantage well . Potential risk study involve risk standard laparoscopic procedure include bleeding , infection , injury surround structure port/trocar site pain . Potential risk associate use flexible endoscopic instrument include esophageal perforation , bleed sore throat . In addition , possibility may new , unanticipated complication modify surgical technique . Patient risk mitigate procedure perform surgeon expertise laparoscopic surgery flexible endoscopy , well involvement skilled interventional gastroenterologist deem necessary . This feasibility study initially evaluate potential benefit , risk impact patient 's quality life modify surgical technique 10 patient . Once standardized technique establish risk show low , prospective comparative evaluation plan compare modify technique standard laparoscopic approach .</detailed_description>
