	<brief_summary>Smoking induces inflammatory reaction airways ultimately result persistent damage development Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . However , subject smoke end COPD . After long-term smoking , approximately 20 % subject develop COPD . At time , unclear subject develop COPD , whereas others maintain normal lung function . In addition , smoke important consequence asthma . Patients asthma smoke severe asthma often experience asthma exacerbation . In addition , show inhaled corticosteroid less effective smoking asthmatic . With research project , researcher investigate effect smoke airway . To end , researcher compare marker airway inflammation , lung function symptom healthy smoker non-smokers vary age . In addition , researcher compare healthy subject patient asthma COPD characterize early study .</brief_summary>
