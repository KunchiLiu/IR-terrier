Pack year = Number cigarette per day x Number year smoke 20 They exhibit moderate response 1500 grass pollen grains/m3 2 hour Vienna Challenge Chamber , define nasal symptom score least 6 . ( Nasal symptom score sum nasal obstruction , rhinorrhoea , nasal itch sneeze , score scale 0 3 ) They positive skin prick test ( wheal ³ 4mm ) grass pollen within 12 month precede screen visit . They positive RAST ( Radioallergosorbent Test ) ( ³ class 2 ) grass pollen within 12 month precede screen visit . They TNSS score ( Total Nasal Symptom Score ) less 3 score 1 single symptom TNSS prior screen allergen challenge . There condition factor would make subject unlikely able stay trial Able provide write informed consent . The subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction . Demonstrated ability use intranasal device satisfactory repeatable manner . As result medical interview , physical examination screen investigation , principle investigator delegate physician deems subject unsuitable study . Subjects must systolic blood pressure 150 mmHg diastolic pressure 90 mmHg unless Investigator confirm satisfactory age . The subject treat diagnosed depression within six month screen history significant psychiatric illness . Pregnant nursing female . Women childbearing potential unwilling unable use appropriate method contraception outline ( Inclusion Criteria 2 ) On examination subject find structural nasal abnormality nasal polyposis , history frequent nosebleed , recent nasal surgery recent ( within 2 week ) ongoing upper respiratory tract infection Responsible Physician 's opinion render subject unsuitable participation study .

The subject likely unable abstain salbutamol use 8 hour challenge . The subject screening QTcB value &gt; 450msec ( base single average QTc value triplicate ECGs obtain brief recording period ) , PQ interval outside range 120 200msec ECG suitable QT measurement ( e.g . poorly define termination Twave ) . In addition subject exclude history atrial ventricular arrhythmia . The subject history drug allergy , opinion physician responsible , contraindicate participation . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion physician responsible , contraindicate participation .
