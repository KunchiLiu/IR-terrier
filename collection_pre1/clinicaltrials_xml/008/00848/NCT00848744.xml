	<detailed_description>Acne vulgaris follicular disorder occur pilosebaceous unit skin face , neck , upper trunk . These sebaceous follicle follicular channel adjacent multiacinar sebaceous gland . In lubrication process normal skin , sebum travel follicular canal skin surface , carry along desquamate cell follicular epithelium . Acne develop specialized follicle undergo pathologic alteration result formation non-inflammatory lesion ( comedo ) inflammatory lesion ( papule , pustule , nodule ) 1 . The basic cause acne remain unknown , manifestation think product four pathogenic event : 1 ) increase sebum production fuel androgenic stimulation pubertal period ; 2 ) obstruction pilosebaceous unit due abnormal keratinization process ; 3 ) proliferation Propionibacterium acne , anaerobic diphtheroid normally reside pilosebaceous follicle ; 4 ) inflammation mediate action chemotactic factor various enzyme , initiate part interaction P. acnes toll-like receptor . Impaction pilosebaceous follicle give rise microcomedo thought precursor lesion acne1 . Topical salicylic acid common well-established agent know keratolytic property use treatment acne vulgaris . The safety profile topical salicylic acid well delineate . The common side effect attribute salicylic acid product include irritation , dryness , scaling , burn sting .
