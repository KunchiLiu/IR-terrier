	<brief_summary>Background : - Essential tremor ( ET ) neurological disorder characterize uncontrollable shaking . Several medication use treat ET ; however , often partly effective side effect . - Research study show octanol , food additive similar alcohol , improve tremor animal . Octanol less likely make people drink alcohol . Two early NIH study find one form octanol , call 1-octanol , improve tremor people side effect . - In body , 1-octanol convert octanoic acid . Researchers interested find whether octanoic acid help people ET . Objectives : - To find octanoic acid improve hand tremor people essential tremor . - To measure level octanoic acid blood take . Eligibility : - Patients 21 year age old ET , willing abstain alcohol , caffeine , medication require study willing able fast 12 hour time . - Participants may Asian Native American ancestry genetic susceptibility intoxicate effect study drug . Design : - This study require 3-day hospital admission well two outpatient visit . - Visit 1 ( outpatient ) : Screening visit blood alcohol level test - Medical history , physical neurological examination , blood test , electrocardiogram measure heart function . Women able get pregnant urine pregnancy test . - Patients consume 1.5 ounce alcohol per drink ( three drink least 30 minute apart ) , test evaluate tremor responds . Researchers draw blood measure blood alcohol level 1 hour first drink closely monitor patient sign intoxication . - Inpatient examination - Preparation : Researchers prepare schedule stop tremor medication patient might . Patients may drink alcohol eat drink anything caffeine , include chocolate , least 2 day admission . - Day 1 : Vital sign , blood ( urine pregnancy ) test , electrocardiogram . Patients ask wear tremor monitor , similar wristwatch . Patients also IV line insert blood draw . - Days 2 3 : Randomized study medication ( octanoic acid one day , placebo day ) . Patients fast take drug , allow eat drink test complete ( around noon ) . - Blood drawn take study drug ( total nine time ) take drug . - Tremor measure study , take drug . - Visit 2 ( outpatient ) : 4 7 day discharge - Blood test electrocardiogram , series questionnaire regard study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double-Blind , Placebo Controlled Pilot Study Octanoic Acid Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : We propose study examine safety efficacy octanoic acid essential tremor ( ET ) . STUDY POPULATION : We study 19 adult subject ethanol-responsive ET . DESIGN : Octanoic acid test double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , cross-over design 19 patient essential tremor . The active study medication placebo administer oral single morning dos consecutive day randomize sequence . All subject receive dose define safe accord available toxicity data ( 4mg/kg ) monitor closely total inpatient study phase three day ( day 0 : baseline ; day 1-2 : active study day ) . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome measure study effect tremor power dominant hand , 80 minute administration study substance , compare placebo . Tremor power measure use accelerometry load test central tremor component . Secondary outcome measure include recording tremor power measure accelerometry multiple time point 300 min administration , also record non-dominant hand without load . The change tremor severity document spirography actigraphy well data collect regard drug safety ( laboratory testing , documentation vital sign , adverse event questionnaire intoxication scale ) well pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic property act secondary outcome parameter .</detailed_description>
