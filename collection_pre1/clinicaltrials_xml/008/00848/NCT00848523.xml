	<brief_summary>The drug LBH589 ( panobinostat ) experimental ( investigational ) drug test recurrent ( return ) malignant glioma . An investigational drug one approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . It belong new class drug call `` histone deacetylase inhibitor . '' Histones protein locate nucleus cell bind DNA , chemical make gene . These protein help control gene turn `` '' `` .

	<brief_title>Study LBH589 ( Panobinostat ) Treat Malignant Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis recurrent malignant glioma remain dismal despite advance neurological surgery , radiation oncology chemotherapy . Median overall survival remain mere 14.6 month 2 yr survival 25 % ( Stupp et al . ) Novel treatment clearly need recurrent glioma . Preclinical data suggest histone deacetylase inhibition may effective treatment recurrent malignant glioma . In 1999 , Proceedings National Academy Sciences , Saito report MS-27-275 , benzamide derivative inhibitor histone deacetylase , inhibited growth several different human tumor cell line . The drug ask take call LBH589 panobinostat . It belong new class drug call `` histone deacetylase inhibitor . '' Histones protein locate nucleus cell bind DNA , chemical make gene . These protein help control gene turn `` '' `` '' . Studies show drug like panobinostat ( LBH589 ) may lead tumor cell death . Before start on-study , require standard blood test do . You may test do well . LBH589 ( panobinostat ) drug take three time weekly mouth Monday , Wednesday Friday . You take capsule 8 ounce glass water ( grapefruit orange juice ) empty stomach least 2 hour meal 2 hour next meal . Cycles twenty eight ( 28 ) day long . The study drug may affect heart rhythm . Therefore , closely monitor heart electrocardiogram ( ECG ) take study drug . On first day start take drug , record ECG several different time point : three ECG 's 5 minute interval take first dose 2 hour , 4-6 hour 24-32 hour take first dose . On day 5 19 first cycle ( first twenty eight day ) also obtain ( 3 ) ECG 's : one take daily dose two 2 hour 4-6 hour take medication . On future cycle ( cycle 2 thereafter ) obtain single ECG 's day # 5 22 prior abnormal reading . You return clinic follow-up examination midway first cycle upon completion first cycle follow cycle . Follow-up blood test obtain end first , second fourth week first cycle end follow cycle . Follow-up MRI ( CAT ) scan obtain accord standard care second cycle unless medically indicated time point . Other scan , PET scan , may obtain medically indicate per standard care .</detailed_description>
