	<brief_title>Gossypol Acetic Acid Treating Patients With Recurrent , Metastatic , Primary Adrenocortical Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine proportion patient recurrent , metastatic , primary unresectable adrenocortical carcinoma achieve objective response R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : : I . To evaluate safety drug patient . II . To determine progression-free overall survival patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
