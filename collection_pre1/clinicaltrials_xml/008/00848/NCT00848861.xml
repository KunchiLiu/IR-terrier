	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Propofol Midazolam Plus Meperidine Sedation Outpatient Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy important diagnostic therapeutic procedure . It invasive procedure , well tolerated patient perform without sedation . There considerable variability practice sedation endoscopic procedure worldwide . There center perform significant proportion gastroscopy colonoscopy without sedation . On hand , general anesthesia give 90 % patient undergoing colonoscopy France . Most center use conscious sedation , usually form benzodiazepine and/or narcotic , propofol sedation reserve difficult case . Benzodiazepines narcotic effective safe . However , onset sedation delay , patient conscious sedation inadequate , result poor experience procedure . Moreover , significant post-sedation side effect , nausea , vomit , prolonged recovery period . This substantially increase procedure cost due need prolonged monitoring endoscopy . Propofol , general anesthetic agent , routinely use various procedure surgery . It fast onset action ( within 30-60 second ) , short half life ( 1.8-4.1 minute ) narrow therapeutic window . The current package insert propofol state person train administration general anesthesia administer propofol physician involve procedure patient continuously properly monitor due risk respiratory depression . No death associate propofol sedation report since first introduce gastrointestinal endoscopy mid 1980 . However , need mechanical ventilation result propofol sedation report . In number small trial propofol show superior recovery profile follow various endoscopic procedure include gastroscopy , colonoscopy endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . Indeed , propofol sedation use routinely elective adult procedure center . However , low cost recovery offset need anesthesiologist . Therefore , use propofol sedation limit select endoscopic procedure patient . Although number small randomized trial explore efficacy propofol sedation , evidence definitive . Thus conduct study determine propofol sedation lead short recovery time elective outpatient colonoscopy compare usual care .</detailed_description>
