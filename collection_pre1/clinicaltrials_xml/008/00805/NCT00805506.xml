A physiological lag ISF glucose relative capillary blood glucose note , probably due relatively low blood perfusion sample site . 9 This physiological lag result accuracy error , manifest significant bias blood tissue glucose , particularly period rapid glucose change . This lag error might particularly meaningful glucose rapidly drop towards hypoglycemia .</detailed_description>
