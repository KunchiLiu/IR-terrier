	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , clinically manifest deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , common elusive illness cause significant disability death promptly diagnose effectively treat . The annual incidence VTE United States estimate 1 per 1000 . Death occur approximately 12 % PE case within 1 month diagnosis . At present , clinical management VTE PE hamper gap understand pathogenic mechanism , wide variety patient population , incomplete understand long term risk recurrence death . Given complex presentation risk associate condition , proper risk assessment subsequent prophylaxis at-risk patient crucial . While clinical prediction rule recently develop associate short-term risk stratify patient acute PE , dearth objective biomarkers relate long-term prognosis disease . In addition clinical information , clot burden know strongly associate clinical outcome recurrent VTE . The quantification clot burden require image . CT Pulmonary Angiography ( CTPA ) establish reference image standard diagnosis PE . In addition role superb diagnostic tool , CTPA contain wealth information include characteristic clot may use biomarkers associate prognosis PE . The work propose application take advantage widely available CTPA image biomarker data extends advance clinical PE risk prediction model include long term ( 2-year ) survival well clinically important outcome recurrence . The primary objective proposal develop identify CTPA image biomarkers associate short-term long-term prognosis patient positively diagnose PE CT . The rationale proposal CT image rich source image biomarkers may associate prognosis PE . This information help advance understand risk recurrence PE provide new insight prognosis clinical management treatment PE . This propose research innovative develop new CT imaging biomarkers design clinical trial ass validate prognostic value biomarkers . Our central hypothesis CT image biomarkers associate risk death recurrence patient PE . The specific aim proposal : ( 1 ) quantify characterize pulmonary embolus ( volume distribution ) comorbid cardiovasculopulmonary finding CT image patient positively diagnose PE CT ; ( 2 ) identify CT image biomarkers associate prognosis patient positively diagnose PE CT , develop risk prediction tool death recurrence ; ( 3 ) prospectively validate risk prediction tool , identify whether change CT image biomarkers PE initiation therapy improve predictive ability recurrence death .</brief_summary>
