	<brief_summary>To assess initial safety clinical feasibility neuromodulation therapy treat patient document overactive bladder . The specific aim improve urinary frequency urgency 12 week treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulsed Electromagnetic Stimulation Treatment Overactive Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty Forty patient document overactive bladder receive 30 minute treatment one day week 12 week . Treatment consist stimulate posterior tibial nerve area ankle pulse electromagnetic field . Study treatment administer commercially available MagPro R30 , cool figure eight coil , surface electrode place afferent pathway sacral nerve . The specific aim improve urinary frequency urgency 12 week treatment . Secondary goal . - To estimate extent device decrease number episode involuntary urine loss due frequency/urgency comparison historical control . - To evaluate potential device improve patient quality life measure clinically validate scale , Incontinence Quality Life Instrument ( I-QOL ) equivalent - To periodically employ micturition diary record variable day/night urgency/frequency episode , number void per day , severity leak , number absorbent product use per day , etc .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Urinary Bladder , Overactive</mesh_term>
	<criteria>The patient &gt; 18 year old . The patient â‰¥ 6 month history document overactive bladder . The patient fail conventional therapy ( i.e . Kegel exercise , biofeedback methodology , etc. ) . The patient free mechanical urethral obstruction document cystoscopy pressure flow criterion . The patient demonstrate understanding neuromodulation therapy , benefit , potential risk . The patient willing able keep accurate record void provide void diary . The patient willing able comply Study Protocol . The patient agree capable answer quality life questionnaire . The patient normal function upper urinary tract . The patient intact peripheral neurosensory system . If patient is/was pharmacologic treatment urgency/frequency syndrome , 10day washout period prior treatment must complete . The patient sufficient outlet resistance urinary sphincter ( i.e . patient intrinsic sphincter deficiency ) . The patient pregnant intend become pregnant course study . ( Patients become pregnant course study immediately terminate study . ) Warning : The effect neuromodulation develop fetus unknown The patient active urinary tract infection . The patient abnormal cystoscopy , concern indicative malignancy . The patient urinary fistula . The patient bladder stone . The patient ankle injury surgery result inability stimulate tibial nerve discomfort use foot cradle The patient metal implant surgery metallic foreign body either leg ( distal ) knee . The patient cochlear implant . The patient hyperreflexic neurogenic bladder urodynamically proven instability secondary know neurourologic cause ( i.e . stroke , Parkinson 's , Multiple Sclerosis ) . The patient four urinary tract infection past year . The patient chronic disease diminish mental capacity , Principal Investigator 's judgement , would impair ability successfully understand comply protocol . The patient history gross hematuria glycosuria within last year . The patient chronic constipation ( less two ( 2 ) bowel movement per week ) . The patient significant pathology would compromise sphincter competency . The patient uncontrolled diabetes . The patient diagnose peripheral neuropathy diabetes peripheral nerve involvement . The patient concomitant medical condition would limit success procedure confound study result , include limited patient nerve damage , pacemaker implantable defibrillator . The patient unable unwilling sign inform consent . The patient pharmacologic treatment could affect bladder function . The patient know moderate severe ureteral reflux hydronephrosis . The patient severe urethral stricture ( ) .</criteria>
