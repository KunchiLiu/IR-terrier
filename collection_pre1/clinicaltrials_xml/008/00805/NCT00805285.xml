	<brief_title>The Use Oral Budesonide Rectal Hydrocortisone Treatment Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) common chronic inflammatory condition intestine result bloody diarrhea , abdominal pain , extraintestinal manifestation disease . The disease course typically chronic , characterized periodic exacerbation follow symptom- free interval ; le commonly symptom continuous unrelenting . The symptoms disease course profound , detrimental impact quality life patient UC . The initial therapeutic approach depend upon extent colonic involvement severity disease process presentation . Typically , patient treat base pyramid `` Step '' approach . If patient mild symptom , receive less powerful therapy low pyramid few side effect . Patients disease confine distal colon typically treat topical therapy include either 5-ASA steroid enema . However , symptom worsen severe time diagnosis , patient receive aggressive therapy higher pyramid include steroid . Despite medical therapy , 50 % colectomy become steroid dependent one year receiving steroid . Steroids associate significant side effect . Adverse consequence steroid relate dose duration exposure , include limited cosmetic side effect , ocular disease ( glaucoma , cataract ) , diabetes , hypertension , vascular disease , osteoporosis , neuropsychiatric complication , increase risk infection . Newer `` designer '' corticosteroid include budesonide reduce systemic bioavailability high local anti-inflammatory activity ; result associate few less severe side effect . Studies prove efficacy budesonide induce remission active Crohn 's disease . However , data use oral budesonide patient UC less extensive . However , data regard efficacy topical therapy left-sided UC extensive . Randomized controlled trial budesonide enemas demonstrate similar efficacy safety profile hydrocortisone enema induction remission leave sided UC . We choose utilize hydrocortisone enema study widely available United States . A 52-week open-label pilot study perform University Maryland Medical Center . Subjects include patient previously newly diagnose extensive ulcerative colitis . Patients treat oral budesonide rectal hydrocortisone 8 week follow predetermined taper . All patient undergo research clinic visit enrollment week 8 . During visit , patient complete series questionnaire measure patient 's disease activity , quality life , side effect , medical compliance , parameter . Blood draws stool study require study visit monitor blood count , electrolyte , liver function , inflammatory marker , adrenal function . Additionally , week 16 , ACTH ( cosyntropin ) stimulation test perform . After obtain basal cortisol level , 250 ug cosyntropin give intravenously . Plasma sample cortisol drawn 30 minute assess adrenal insufficiency . Close follow-up eight 30-min telephone session ( every 2-3 week ) also conduct assess disease activity adverse event . The goal study determine whether combination therapy use oral budesonide topical hydrocortisone result induction remission patient active extensive ulcerative colitis . Further , aim show combination therapy well tolerate less severe side effect compare conventional therapy prednisone .</detailed_description>
