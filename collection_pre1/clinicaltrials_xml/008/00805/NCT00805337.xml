	<brief_title>Low Levels Electromagnetic Fields Treat Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We previously show intrabuccal administration low safe level electromagnetic field , amplitude-modulated frequency 42.7 Hz mean battery-powered portable device modifies electroencephalographic activity healthy subject ( 1 , 2 ) associate subjective objective relaxation effect ( 3 ) . These result prompt u study effect 42.7 Hz frequency patient suffer insomnia . A randomized control trial reveal difference 42.7 Hz treatment placebo ( 4 ) sequential administration four insomnia-specific frequency , include 42.7 Hz , result significant decrease sleep latency significant increase total sleep time patient suffer chronic insomnia ( 5 ) . Dosimetric study show amount electromagnetic field deliver brain patient approach 100 1000 time lower amount electromagnetic field deliver handheld cellular phone result heat effect within brain ( 4 ) . The U.S. FDA determine device significant risk device . Lastly , long-term follow-up survey 807 patient receive therapy revealed rate adverse reaction low associate increase incidence malignancy coronary heart disease ( 6 ) . Given advantageous safety profile athermal , non-ionizing radiofrequency electromagnetic field emerge evidence low level electromagnetic electric field may modify growth tumor cell ( 7-9 ) , decide test hypothesis low level electromagnetic field modulate tumor-specific frequency may alter growth human malignancy . We develop novel patient-based biofeedback method goal identify cancer-specific frequency examine patient approach . Following identification frequency total 163 patient , offer compassionate treatment 28 patient advanced cancer limit palliative therapeutic option .</detailed_description>
