	<brief_summary>The elderly fast grow proportion population . Ageism imply decline physical function affect functional safe ambulation . Based ICF model intervene walk capacity could favourable impact quality life frail elder . Over ground walk train indicated possible exercise . However , achieve positive result walk capacity , exercise-dose response need . A intensive way promote walk train add skiing pole walk , technique call Nordic Walking ( NW ) . This study first compare NW usual walking training . It aim estimate frail elderly relative efficacy improve functional walk capacity two gait training strategy : NW usual walk train explore impact fear fall . This study hypothesize participant receive Nordic Walking walk longer , faster fear less . NW proven effective positively impact functional capacity quality life frail elder provide intense method walk training .</brief_summary>
