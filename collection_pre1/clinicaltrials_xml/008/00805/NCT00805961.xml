	<brief_summary>In phase II trial investigator plan incorporate two targeted agent , bevacizumab everolimus , first-line multimodality therapy glioblastoma . In first portion treatment , bevacizumab add standard concurrent radiation therapy plus temozolomide . After complete radiation therapy , patient continue treatment combination bevacizumab everolimus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although maintenance regimen depart standard treatment single agent temozolomide , feel approach may add overall efficacy treatment follow reason : 1 ) result bevacizumab/everolimus renal cell carcinoma suggest least additive efficacy drug use combination ; 2 ) efficacy single agent temozolomide follow standard concurrent radiation therapy/temozolomide proven , 3 ) use three-drug maintenance program ( i.e. , bevacizumab/everolimus/temozolomide ) would probably tolerate well chronic basis patient population ; 4 ) bevacizumab/everolimus combination potential advantage maintenance therapy , since well tolerate many month patient malignancy .</detailed_description>
