	<criteria>Patients must diagnosis urothelial carcinoma bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis , histological confirmation MSKCC . Patients must progressive metastatic disease . Progressive disease define new progressive lesion crosssectional imaging . Patients must least one measurable site disease ( accord RECIST criterion ) previously irradiate . Patients must previously treat , define follow : Treatment least one prior cytotoxic agent four prior cytotoxic agent . Up four prior chemotherapy agent allow , since conventional chemotherapy range one drug ( e.g. , gemcitabine ) regimens contain four agent ( e.g. , MVAC fourdrug regimen contain methotrexate , vinblastine , doxorubicin , cisplatin ) . The prior therapy must include least one following : cisplatin , carboplatin , paclitaxel , docetaxel , gemcitabine . The prior cytotoxic agent may administer perioperative metastatic setting may administer sequentially ( e.g. , firstline treatment follow secondline treatment time progression ) part single regimen . Patients must pretreatment tumor tissue available analysis mTOR pathway marker . One paraffin block 10 freshlyprepared unstained slide ( positively charge slide immunohistochemistry ) representative single paraffinembedded tumor tissue block . Slides primary tumor prefer . If primary metastatic tumor block available , 10 slide site submit . If tissue primary tumor available , paraffin block unstained slide metastatic site acceptable . Fine needle aspirate ( FNAs ) insufficient tumor tissue permit . Age ≥ 18 year Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60 % Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L , Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN INR &lt; 1.3 ( &lt; 3 anticoagulant ) ALT AST ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN patient liver metastasis ) Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : If patient 's lipid value exceed either one criterion upon screen , patient become eligible successful initiation appropriate lipidlowering medication . After lipidlowering therapy , patient must meet criterion i.e . fast serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN eligible study treatment Signed informed consent . Testing hepatitis B viral load serological marker ( HBVDNA , HBsAg , HBsAb , HBcAb ) follow patient : All patient currently live ( live ) Asia , Africa , Central South America , Eastern Europe , Spain , Portugal , Greece Patients follow risk factor : Known suspect past hepatitis B infection Blood transfusion ( ) prior 1990 Current prior IV drug user Current prior dialysis Household contact hepatitis B infect person ( ) Current prior highrisk sexual activity Body pierce tattoos Mother know hepatitis B History suggestive hepatitis B infection , e.g dark urine , jaundice , right upper quadrant pain Additional patient discretion investigator Testing hepatitis C infection ( use quantitative RNAPCR ) patient follow risk factor : Known suspect past hepatitis C infection ( include patient past interferon `` curative '' treatment ) Blood transfusion ( ) prior 1990 Current prior IV drug user Household contact hepatitis C infect person ( ) Current prior highrisk sexual activity Body pierce tattoos Additional patient discretion investigator Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , etc . ) Patients major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) , patient may require major surgery course study . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week . Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent , except corticosteroid daily dosage equivalent prednisone ≤ 20 mg . Patients receive corticosteroid must stable dosage regimen minimum 4 week prior first treatment Everolimus . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period . Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastasis . Evidence another active cancer , except nonmelanoma skin carcinoma , insitu carcinoma cervix curatively treat , adenocarcinoma prostate surgically treat posttreatment PSA nondetectable Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III IV . Unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , clinically significant cardiac disease . Severely impaired lung function evidence : ( TLC ) &lt; 50 % predict , OR ( FVC ) &lt; 50 % predict OR , ( DLCO ) &lt; 40 % predict Uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 x ULN . Active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection . Liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis , chronic persistent hepatitis . A known history HIV seropositivity . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption Everolimus ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . Patients active , bleeding diathesis . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding , Women childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration Everolimus . Adults reproductive potential use effective birth control method . Men woman childbearing potential must willing use effective barrier method contraception trial least three month thereafter . Patients encourage continue barrier method contraception two year longer treatment . Hormonal contraceptives acceptable sole method contraception Patients receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Patients know hypersensitivity Everolimus ( RAD001 ) rapamycins ( sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients . History noncompliance medical regimen . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol .</criteria>
