	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine measure level protein call Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ( KIM-1 ) urine help healthcare provider detect problem transplant kidney laboratory investigation use routine basis . This approach may allow doctor intervene earlier point rejection episode may thereby prolong survival transplant kidney .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urinary Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ( KIM-1 ) Excretion As Biomarker Injury Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS : 1 . To investigate role urinary Kim-1 excretion marker delay graft function , acute kidney allograft rejection and/or virus-induced allograft nephropathy and/or calcineurin-inhibitor nephrotoxicity . 2 . To determine role urinary Kim-1 excretion predict long term outcome kidney transplantation compare standard diagnostic test . 3 . To determine role reduction urinary Kim-1 excretion rejection episode and/or viral infection marker repair renal tubule . HYPOTHESIS : Monitoring urinary KIM-1 kidney transplant recipient facilitate detection delay graft function , acute allograft rejection infectious cause proximal tubular injury , allow early intervention well long-term graft survival . Detection urinary KIM-1 precede increase serum creatinine detect acute graft injury urinary KIM-1 decrease faster serum creatinine predict responsiveness ( lack thereof ) intervention accurately .</detailed_description>
