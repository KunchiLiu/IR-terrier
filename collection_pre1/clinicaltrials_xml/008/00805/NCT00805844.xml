	<detailed_description>Motor Evoked Potential ( MEP ) monitoring spine surgery use routinely . However affected variety anesthetic include fluctuate and/or excessively deep light level anesthesia . A common problem maintain overall constancy adequacy anesthesia . Individual patient ' response anesthesia differ greatly population mean complicate interpretation MEPs . False alarm significant consequence . One strategy minimize anesthetic induced variability MEPs , thereby improve monitor overall , keep patient 's anesthetic state ( `` depth '' ) narrow range surgery . This study test whether use commercially available depth anesthesia monitor addition usual clinical practice improve quality MEPs . The hypothesis study SedLine Monitor , use EEG derive assessment anesthetic depth , may facilitate MEP monitor keep within narrow range spine surgery . Because SedLine recommend maintain Index 30 40 surgical anesthesia , range use primary hypothesis .</detailed_description>
