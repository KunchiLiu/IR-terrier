	<brief_summary>In between-subject randomized control trial investigator test impact three novel structure financial incentive : atomistic , altruistic team-based . These incentive scheme use motivate one month daily use software design improve cognitive function ( include memory , reaction time , attention executive function ) among elderly . The 400 participant member retirement community Pennsylvania . Three outcome monitor analyzed : activity complete use software ( primary ) , performance activity , change cognitive functioning . This study design pilot study . The investigator 90 % power find mean daily difference 4 activity complete control group versus 7 activity complete incentive group assume standard deviation 3.5 alpha 0.017 ( bonferroni correct significance level account multiple comparison ) . In addition three month `` follow-up period '' participant continue access software , however , incentive provide use . This period use assess impact initial incentive long run use financial incentive cease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study , 4-arm randomize control trial , test three novel incentive system intend promote daily use computer program design improve memory mental acuity among resident retirement community . Three outcome measure use assess effectiveness incentive program : number activity complete use software ( primary outcome interest ) , performance activity , difference pre post measure mental acuity ( use standardize test mental function ) . Incentives use software offer individual experimental condition first month 4 month study . After initial month incentive , individual continue access software , however , incentive provide use . Incentives : Three incentive structure test one control group : 1 . Control : Access software program , reward use . 2 . Atomistic : Each individual reward individual participation 3 . Altruistic : Participants pair individual different retirement community reward accord individual 's participation 4 . Combination cooperative/competitive : Individuals pair team compete . Each team reward accord relative participation , member within team receive amount . Pairs match gender , age , education , pair randomly assign different incentive condition . Rewards incentive condition range maximum $ 5 per day , award differently depend incentive condition . Although participant informed winning day ( give frequent positive reinforcement ) , pay cumulated amount month ( reduce transaction cost ensure actual payment substantial ) . The number activity complete use software ( 10 daily , approximately 30 minute use ) basis daily incentive payment reward effort avoid discourage highly skilled . Cognitive test do NueroTrax Mindstreams cognitive test software . Subjects : Roughly 400 participant recruit local retirement community offer compute service resident . Subjects age 55 85 require sign inform consent form admit study . Due focus population face cognitive decline , extra care take ensure participant understand information provide informed consent document . We enroll potential participant able verbalize understanding content consent form . Participants train basic computer use operation software use Carnegie Mellon University mobile research van ( see http : //www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2007/June/june20_datatruck.shtml ) . This pilot study serve basis larger-scale study financial incentive elderly individual engage mentally challenge task help improve cognitive function . In addition , research help u determine relative effectiveness different type incentive design could use study use financial incentive encourage elderly engage variety healthy behavior .</detailed_description>
