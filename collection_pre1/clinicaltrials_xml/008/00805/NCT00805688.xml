	<brief_title>Identifying Role Symptom Outcomes Biomarkers Survival Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers want try improve patient care advance pancreatic cancer look symptom create great burden daily life . They also want find `` marker '' blood . Biomarkers substance find blood , cytokine , certain protein , DNA change . These biomarkers may help doctor predict `` symptom burden '' therapy . Researchers would also like collect data physical function part study . If agree wear pedometer , wear pedometer every day month waking hour . The pedometer use study small box weigh less ounce small deck playing card . It use measure number step take day . Researchers help set pedometer show use . You also keep diary record use pedometer month . Researchers meet clinic visit chemotherapy 2 week 4 week collect data . If agree take part study , follow 4 type study procedure perform : Questionnaire : Before chemotherapy schedule GI Medical Oncology Clinic start , ask complete questionnaire visit clinic . The questionnaire measure physical emotional symptom . It take 5 minute finish . During visit , research staff also teach use telephone system measure symptom . You tell research staff convenient time telephone call week system set call time . Blood Draws : Before begin chemotherapy treatment , sample blood drawn ( around 3½ tablespoon ) . The sample blood use measure level cytokine ( biomarkers blood ) DNA ( genetic material cell ) blood treatment start . These cytokine may relate symptom experienced treatment cancer . You 2½ tablespoon blood drawn complete first second cycle chemotherapy , 2 month 4 month start date chemotherapy . Each blood sample draw routine blood draw continue chemotherapy . Symptoms Review : You MDASI-GI symptom assessment face face , regular mail , phone call . These used measure symptom burden time treatment treatment . The assessment do weekly 4 month twice month additional 14 month . If assessment do phone , may do study staff member use interactive voice response telephone system ( IVRS ) . During study , automate telephone system call week ask rate symptom much symptom get way daily life . The information collect call use research study . This phone call take 5 minute complete . This investigational study . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
