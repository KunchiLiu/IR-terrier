	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate potential [ 18F ] -ML-10 serve image tool early detection response brain metastasis radiation therapy . Such early detection may help early identification responsive non-responsive lesion . The experimental design present study aim evaluate potential PET image [ 18F ] -ML-10 address currently unmet clinical need early ( within one day ) assessment response therapy . Currently , response assessment available several week month completion therapy , tumor shrinkage detect anatomical imaging ( MRI ) . Early detection tumor response treatment widely-recognized highly-desirable goal oncology , respectively target intense research worldwide . In future , option know early upon treatment administration , treat tumor non-responsive , may improve clinical management patient brain metastasis solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early assessment efficacy anti-cancer therapy highly desirable unmet need clinical oncology . Currently , treatment efficacy mostly measure follow tumor size anatomical imaging ( CT scan MRI ) . However , change tumor size may observe several week several month completion treatment . Meanwhile , case response , patient unnecessarily expose treatment 's side effect , precious time may lose initiation alternative , potentially beneficial line therapy . Therefore , urgent serious need well tool monitor tumor response anti-cancer treatment . To address need , [ 18F ] -ML-10 , novel small molecular-weight probe ( MW 205 ) develop clinical detection apoptosis vivo positron emission tomography ( PET ) . [ 18F ] -ML-10 member Aposense family compound , novel class molecular probe molecular image cell death . The propose indication [ 18F ] -ML-10 develop early assessment response solid tumor radiation chemoradiation therapy . Previous preclinical clinical study substantiate safety [ 18F ] -ML-10 , high stability vivo , favorable biodistribution profile , efficacy clinical detection cell death . In preclinical study , selective retention [ 18F ] -ML-10 focus neurovascular cell death cerebral ischemia demonstrate respective animal model . [ 18F ] -ML-10 examine two clinical trial Uppsala Imanet , Sweden , find safe administration healthy subject elderly subject acute ischemic cerebral stroke . In clinical trial , [ 18F ] -ML-10 also find efficacious clinical imaging apoptosis , either physiological apoptosis observe testis young healthy male , pathological cell death , observed brain patient acute ischemic cerebral stroke . Additional Phase 2 study demonstrate suitability safety 18F-ML-10 , design serve PET radiotracer early detection cellular apoptosis brain metastasis response WBRT . The relationship early change 18F-ML-10 uptake tumor , observe upon completion treatment , subsequent tumor shrinkage observe MRI eight week completion WBRT , demonstrated.18F-ML-10 demonstrate good safety profile drug-related AEs effect safety parameter .</detailed_description>
