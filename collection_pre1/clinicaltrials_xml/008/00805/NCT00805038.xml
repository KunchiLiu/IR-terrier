	<brief_summary>Compared chronic dialysis treatment , kidney transplantation generally offer longer life span , good quality life , low health care cost 500,000 Americans End Stage Renal Disease . Despite Medicare fund virtually kidney transplant , minority , female , poor patient End Stage Renal Disease decrease access kidney transplantation . In prior work , investigator identify step transplant process responsible create disparity . These include medical suitability , interest receiving transplant , referral transplant center pre-transplant workup , placement wait list identification live donor , receipt kidney decease living donor . The investigator propose train transplant recipient act transplant navigator test value use transplant navigator help patient provider complete step . The propose community-based randomized control trial involve approximately 75-100 adult hemodialysis patient intervention dialysis facility approximately 75-100 patient control facility compare transplant navigator intervention usual care 24 month interval . Baseline evaluation include sociodemographic medical characteristic , specific step complete transplant process , barrier move forward transplant process . At periodic interval , navigator provide tailor information assistance patient nephrologists help complete task require step . The major outcome completion additional step transplant process . Secondary analysis examine impediment successful intervention among subject fail move forward transplant process despite assistance navigator . The propose project test novel intervention target patient nephrologists together make transplant-related decision . Future work involve determine impact navigator disparities transplant rate , examine cost-effectiveness transplant navigator , disseminate intervention use across country . Helping patient complete step transplant process may lead improved access kidney transplantation also well patient survival , decrease health care cost , increase quality life .</brief_summary>
