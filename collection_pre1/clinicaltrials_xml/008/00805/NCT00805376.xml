	<brief_title>DNX-2401 ( Formerly Known Delta-24-RGD-4C ) Recurrent Malignant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : DNX-2401 ( formerly know Delta-24-RGD-4C ) virus work kill brain tumor cell . It make common cold virus , call adenovirus , type 5 . This virus normally cause common cold , people around world expose many time common , naturally-occurring virus life . Two ( 2 ) change make adenovirus make DNX-2401 . The first change make virus grow cancer cell . The second change make allow DNX-2401 enter cancer cell easily . These change make DNX-2401 able multiply kill cancer cell less likely multiply normal cell . Study Groups : Participants eventually divide 2 group ( Groups A B ) . At first , participant enrol Group A . Participants Group A receive study drug recurrent malignant glioma tumor remove surgery . Enrollment Group B start FDA review initial result treatment participant Group A effect brain tumor cell body general . Once approval enrollment give , eligible participant assign Group B receive study drug tumor remove surgery . If receive surgery , ask sign separate surgical consent form help explain operation . If find eligible take part study , assign dose level DNX-2401 base join study . Up 8 dose level DNX-2401 test . Three ( 3 ) participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose DNX-2401 found . You inform dose receive . Study Drug Administration : DNX-2401 give surgical procedure neurosurgeon precisely inject DNX-2401 catheter ( small tube ) insert brain tumor . You stay hospital watch closely afterward 48 hour , may longer doctor feel ready go home . After receive DNX-2401 , participant must wear mask . You must also stay away pregnant woman , baby , child three year age , elderly people large group people may weaker defense disease spread disease . You must also stay away patient may immune system problem , people AIDS , people get chemotherapy radiation therapy . The study doctor decide long need follow precaution . You donate blood sperm least 6 month receive DNX-2401 . Group A : Before receive DNX-2401 , participant Group A sample ( stereotactic biopsy ) brain tumor tissue collect confirm recurrent malignant glioma present . On morning biopsy , MRI ( dye ) . A metal frame place head MRI brain do . Before MRI , dye inject help give doctor good picture brain . The head frame allow surgeon use MRI identify precise location tumor within brain . The frame stay place several hour procedure perform . A portion head shave biopsy . You small incision ( cut ) head ( 2-3 inch ) . The protective covering brain ( dura ) open piece brain tumor remove . If , microscope , biopsy show tumor still malignant glioma , injection DNX-2401 . The anesthesiologist ( doctor give anesthesia ) may give medication make sedate ( anesthesia ) . They place needle vein ( intravenous line `` IV '' ) give medicine . The anesthesia give feel pain discomfort move MRI surgery . A small catheter place tumor metal frame help guide proper placement . Some anti-inflammatory medication ( steroid call dexamethasone ) give vein . Then DNX-2401 slowly inject tumor 10 minute . After injection , incision close standard cosmetically acceptable manner . Group B : Before receive DNX-2401 , participant Group B biopsy confirm tumor recurrent glioma . The procedure exactly describe Group A . This call `` Stage 1 . '' However , end biopsy study drug injection procedure , catheter clip next skull portion tube remain inside tumor place next 2 week . The scalp close clip catheter prevent possibility infection . The next day , CT scan check tumor placement catheter . Group A Follow-up Visits : You come back study center check-ups 4 , 7,14 28 day , 2 , 3 , 4 month injection , every 2 month 2 year . After , ask return clinic every 4 month rest life . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You ask give information new medication therapy , include vitamin , herb , supplement may take . - You ask describe change health feel . - You neurological exam . - Your weight measure Day 28 2 , 3 4 month . - Your vital sign measure . - You ask provide blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) , urine sample swab nose throat take . - You blood test ( 4 teaspoon ) evaluate clinical status Days 4 , 7 , 28 , 2 , 3 4 month . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect look presence anti-AD5 virus . - Women able become pregnant must blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test 1 4 month visit follow-up visit . - You MRI visit except Day 4 . - After 4 month visit , evaluation see respond treatment first 2 year every 4 month . Group B Follow-up Visits : You see study center check-ups Days 4 , 7 , 13 injection craniotomy . At visit follow test procedure perform : - You ask give information new medication therapy , include vitamin , herb , supplement may take . - You ask describe change health feel . - You neurological exam . - Your vital sign measure . - You ask provide blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) , urine sample swab nose throat take . - You blood test ( 4 teaspoon ) evaluate clinical status . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect look presence anti-AD5 virus . - Women able become pregnant must blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test Day 13 , 1 4 month visit follow-up visit . - You MRI Days 7 13 . If feel well 14 day first injection study drug , bring back operating room second procedure remove tumor . You undergo craniotomy , skull tumor remove get brain tumor . The neurosurgeon try remove tumor completely possible catheter tip first procedure place . After tumor remove , receive another dose DNX-2401 inject brain tissue surround tumor try kill remain tumor cell . This call `` Stage 2 . '' The skull replace skin close . Within 6 hour craniotomy Day 14 , neurological exam vital sign measure . On day resection , sample remove brain tumor tissue collect stored study . Analysis tissue perform look presence activity virus , well additional test necessary protocol purpose . Group B Follow-up Visits Craniotomy : After surgery , see hospital come back center Days 15 , 18 , 21 , 28 , 42 , 2 , 3 4 month , every 2 month 2 year . After , ask come back every 4 month rest life . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You ask give information new medication therapy , include vitamin , herb , supplement may take . - You ask describe change health feel . - You neurological exam . - Your weight measure Day 28 , 42 2 , 3 4 month . - Your vital sign measure . - You ask provide blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) , urine sample , swab nose throat . - You blood test ( 4 teaspoon ) evaluate clinical status . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw look presence anti-AD5 virus . - Women become pregnant must blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test visit except Day 15 18 . - You MRI . For participant clinically unable wait 14 day surgery tumor 's size and/or location , experience serious neurological symptom , study chair may decide skip biopsy . Group B Follow-up Visits ( Stage 2 -- Craniotomy Only ) : After surgery , see hospital come back center Days 1 , 4 , 7 , 14 , 28 ; 2 , 3 , 4 month ; every 2 month 2 year . After , ask come back every 4 month rest life . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You ask give information new medication therapy , include vitamin , herb , supplement may take . - You ask describe change health feel . - You neurological exam . - Your weight measure Day 28 2 , 3 , 4 month . - Your vital sign measure . - You ask provide blood sample ( 1 teaspoon ) , urine sample , swab nose throat . - You blood test ( 4 teaspoon ) evaluate clinical status . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw look presence anti-AD5 virus . - Women become pregnant must blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test 1- 4-month visit follow-up visit . - You MRI . This investigational study . At time , DNX-2401 use research . Up 96 patient take part study ( 48 Group A 48 Group B ) . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
