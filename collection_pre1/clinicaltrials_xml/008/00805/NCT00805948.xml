	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate long-term safety effectiveness Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System treatment descend thoracic aneurysm ( DTA ) follow U.S. market approval .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-Approval Clinical Study Talent Thoracic Stent Graft Treat Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms ( THRIVE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A descending thoracic aneurysm bulge aorta . The aorta large blood vessel carry blood away heart organs rest body . Your aneurysm cause weaken artery wall . If leave untreated , bulge may continue grow large may ultimately rupture ( break open ) extend size seriously affect major artery area . In clinical study Talent Thoracic Stent Graft place inside aorta block weaken part artery wall circulatory system . Medtronic Vascular submit Pre-Market Application ( PMA P070007 ) FDA February 28 , 2007 , receive market approval Talent Stent Graft System June 5 , 2008 . As condition approval , FDA request post-market trial . In collaboration FDA , Medtronic design post-approval study document long-term performance Talent Stent Graft System post market condition . This study examine post-market performance Talent Thoracic Stent Graft System . This study prospective , non-randomized five-year trial . Originally , total 451 subject go analyzed . That group consist 195 enrolled subject VALOR Test Group Talent Thoracic PMA Submission , 256 plan `` de novo '' subject enrol PMA approval . However , Medtronic discontinue manufacture study device US commercialization , result , enrollment terminate May 2014 , determine proximal device available either inventory site . A total 349 subject analyze , base 195 VALOR Test Group subject 154 `` de novo '' subject .</detailed_description>
