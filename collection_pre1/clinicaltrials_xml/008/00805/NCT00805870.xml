	<brief_title>The Effects High Dose Fish Oil Supplementation Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness Inflammatory Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When person exercise high intensity start new exercise program , muscle soreness develop . Muscle soreness peak 24-72 hour exercise diminish 5-7 day characterize delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) . DOMS associate eccentric phase exercise , muscle actively create force lengthening . The onset muscle soreness part inflammatory response due muscular damage cause exercise . Research show fish oil anti-inflammatory property . Direct intake various polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) alters cell membrane fatty acid composition , , turn modulates cell/tissue response infection , injury inflammatory event . These property may beneficial relieve muscle soreness . Therefore , purpose study determine effect fish oil supplementation ( Lovaza , GlaxoSmithKline , 3 gram per day 65 day ) muscle strength , muscle soreness inflammation follow exercise . Participants randomly assign one two group : Lovaza ( 3 grams/day ) placebo . Participants consume either Lovaza placebo 65 consecutive day . On Day 60 , participant baseline measurement muscle strength , muscle soreness , creatine kinase activity , muscle inflammatory marker assess . Participants perform eccentric exercise isokinetic dynamometer use quadriceps muscle order induce muscle soreness . On Days 61-65 , muscle strength , muscle soreness , creatine kinase activity , muscle inflammatory marker assess .</detailed_description>
