	<brief_summary>The aim study compare postoperative complication removal low third molar use two different type anaesthetic two different treatment swell inflammation ( methylprednisolone placebo ) . The hypothesis combination long-duration anaesthetic combine methylprednisolone result significantly less postoperative pain inflammation . Patients low third molar remove two separate occasion . Each patient randomly assign receive one type local anaesthetic first time type second time . Furthermore patient randomise receive either methylprednisolone placebo first time opposite treatment second time . During week surgery patient fill questionnaire question level pain swell different time well patient ' perception postoperative complication . The patient examine dentist 2nd 7th day surgery , postoperative complication record thermographic image patient 's face take assess degree inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Operative Course Connection With Removal Lower Third Molars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : After removal lower third molar complication occur , include pain , swell , infection sensory disturbance . As pain intensity show bad first 4-8 hour post surgery , might relevant use local anaesthetic long duration , e.g . bupivacaine , instead traditionally used lidocaine . Several study focus effect non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug ( glucocorticoid , e.g . methylprednisolone ) reduce postoperative swelling . However , study compare effect bupivacaine combine methylprednisolone lidocaine combine methylprednisolone conduct . Aim : To compare postoperative complication removal low third molar use 1 ) lidocaine , 2 ) lidocaine combine methylprednisolone , 3 ) bupivacaine 4 ) bupivacaine combine methylprednisolone . Methods : The study compare type end extension postoperative complication removal low third molar use four different combination local anaesthetic anti-inflammatory treatment . The study conduct double blind , split mouth crossover trial , patient low third molar remove two different occasion . Patients randomise receive one type local anaesthetic first time type second time . Furthermore patient randomise receive either methylprednisolone placebo first time opposite treatment second time . An objective assessment postoperative swell inflammation make mean thermographic image operated side compare opposite side operation 2 7 day post surgery . Each patient fill questionnaire , patient ' perception pain , swell complication register . Furthermore , complication record objectively dentist 2- 7-day post-surgery visit</detailed_description>
