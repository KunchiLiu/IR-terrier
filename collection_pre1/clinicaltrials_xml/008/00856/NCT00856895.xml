In addition KDQOL-SF , examine current level renal function type donor mention prospective part proposal . AIM 3 : To determine difference QOL Hispanic kidney transplant recipient Hispanic transplant program NMH develop . In specific aim , test hypothesis cultural educational orient approach Hispanic transplant program improve QOL Hispanic kidney transplant recipient minimize difference compare Non-Hispanic kidney recipient . To achieve compare information cross-sectional evaluation Aim 2 prospective evaluation Aim 1 provide information inception Hispanic transplant program . AIM 4 : To Evaluate social impact service NMH Hispanic Transplant program provide patient participate . Subjects give survey complete experience and/or ask participate interview experience Northwestern Memorial 's Transplant Program .
