	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose topotecan hydrochloride give together doxorubicin hydrochloride treat patient small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) come back period improvement ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan hydrochloride doxorubicin hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Doxorubicin hydrochloride may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving topotecan hydrochloride doxorubicin hydrochloride may better treatment small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety efficacy , term clinical disease benefit , ( complete partial response stable disease stable improve quality life score ) combination oral topotecan ( topotecan hydrochloride ) give weekly doxorubicin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) patient SCLC . II . Determine dose limit toxicity oral topotecan give weekly doxorubicin patient SCLC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate topoisomerase I II level peripheral blood mononuclear cell correlate presence absence grade 3 4 hematological toxicity . II . Estimate topoisomerase I II level peripheral blood mononuclear cell correlate efficacy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study topotecan hydrochloride . Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 3-5 minute day 6 course 1 day 6 , 13 , 20 course 2-5 . Patients also receive topotecan hydrochloride orally ( PO ) day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
