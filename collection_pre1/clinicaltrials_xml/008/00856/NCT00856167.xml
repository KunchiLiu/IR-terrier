	<brief_title>Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) Temporomandibular Dysfunction ( TMD ) : A Whole Systems Multi-site Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) show chronic pain temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) and/or masticatory muscle affect 10 % adult one time one-third adult experience TMD lifespan ( Von Korff et al . 1988 ) . TMD include wide range symptom : facial pain , jaw-joint pain , headache , earache , dizziness , masticatory musculature hypertrophy , limited mouth opening , close open lock TMJ , abnormal occlusal wear , click pop sound jaw joint , complaint ( NIH 1996 ) . Although etiology poorly understood , longitudinal data suggest TMD enduring , recurrent condition resistant problem many ( Dworkin et al . 1992a ; Dworkin et al . 1989 ; Moss 1982 ; Gale 1978 ) , affect individual socioeconomic ethnic group ( Smith &amp; Syrop 1994 ) . In study TMD patient Kaiser Permanente Northwest ( KPNW ) 1990-1995 , mean age 40.5 year , 80 % patient female . TMD subject use 1.6 time service health plan member ( White 2001 ) . The Research Diagnostic Criteria TMD ( RDC/TMD ) propose Dworkin et al . ( Dworkin &amp; LeResche 1992b ) use dual axis system diagnose classify TMD patient . Axis I assign physical diagnosis commonly occur masticatory muscle and/or TMJ disorder ( arthralgia , arthritis , arthroses TMJ ) . Axis II assess behavioral , psychological psychosocial factor ; functional mandibular limitation ; psychological distress , include depression ; Graded Scale Chronic Pain ( GCP ) ( Von Korff et al . 1992 ) . The RDC/TMD criterion Axes I II use numerous clinical research study around world ( Ohrbach &amp; Dworkin 1998 ; List et al . 1996 ; Rudy et al . 1995 ; Garofalo &amp; Wesley 1998 ; Yap et al . 2002 ) . An NIH-supported international consortium RDC/TMD clinical researcher establish foster multinational study TMD use core RDC/TMD standardize method criterion ( http : //www.rdc-tmdinternational.org/ ) . The RDC/TMD suggest model system diagnosis assessment chronic pain condition ( Garofolo &amp; Wesley 1997 ; Dworkin , Sherman et al . 2002 ) . The RDC/TMD use study primary endpoint . Epidemiological study TMD focus estimate prevalence describe characteristic person without condition ( Carlsson &amp; LeResche 1995 ) . In 75 % study review , TMD adequately define . Epidemiologic clinical study TMD confirm fundamental status chronic pain problem ( Bell 1986 ; Fricton et al . 1987 ; Dworkin et al . 1992a ) . Yap et al . ( 2003 ) find 39 % TMD patient also depress , 55 % exhibit elevated level somatization . Similarly , Lee et al . ( 1995 ) find TMD patient frequently present ear pain , neck pain , shoulder pain , headache , previous head neck trauma . In spite number TMD clinical trial , approach find persistently significantly reduce pain disability condition . Our recent phase II RCT ( n=110 woman ) show Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) , include acupuncture herb , comparable well comprehensive specialty usual care reduce pain , good improve disability . The improvement persist , however , TCM treatment end . We hypothesize may due part lack education self-care management . Thus , pain return , know option return TCM practitioner permit protocol . This suggest appropriate way incorporate TCM TMD care include self-care component participant . This proposal test TCM versus self-care management ( SC ) realistic manner consistent integrative , step care strategy , one begin minimal self-care intervention increase intensity relation patient need . At multiple assessment point , participant already TCM randomize self-care TCM depend self-reported TMD pain level . This study design clinically meaningful customary two-group randomization , consider patient outcome ( see study Schema ) . We propose multi-site ( Tucson Portland ) phase II trial ( n=150 ) evaluate potential short-term pain disability benefit TCM follow 18 month compare long-term TCM self-care management . Our specific hypothesis : ( 1 ) among patient fail adequately improve self-care management , randomize TCM less pain disability short term ( 8 week ) randomize enhance extend self-care ( SC ) ; ( 2 ) patient place TCM due inadequate improvement SC show long-term ( 12-18 month ) outcomes similar continue benefit SC . We expand patient population beyond previous study include men woman , well individual receive previous TMD care ( TCM ) continue experience TMD pain . The TCM arm incorporate whole system research , attempt understand component system care relation patient experience . Specific domain consider study include patient-practitioner interaction , patient-centered outcome , process diagnosis treatment proceeds time vary practitioner .</detailed_description>
