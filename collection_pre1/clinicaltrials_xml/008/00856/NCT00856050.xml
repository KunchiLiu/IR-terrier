	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine letrozole effective control growth spread estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive uterine leiomyosarcoma . This drug use research study cancer currently approve FDA use breast cancer . Because letrozole lower hormone level body , may helpful control tumor express hormone receptor ( ER/PR ) .</brief_summary>
