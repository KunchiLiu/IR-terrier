	<brief_title>Venous Thromboembolism Pregnancy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) pregnancy serious , rare condition . There epidemiological data patient group Norway , generally little literature immediate long-term outcome pregnancy . Approximately 50 % woman VTE pregnancy know thrombophilia . These woman also carry considerably increase risk intrauterine fetal death ( IUFD ) . In project want identify new thrombophilias risk factor VTE IUFD pregnancy . Aims : Using case-control design investigate follow issue : - Risk factor VTE pregnancy IUFD - Association thrombophilia , VTE , vascular pregnancy complication include IUFD - Association thrombophilia IUFD - Long term effect VTE pregnancy IUFD future health include quality life - Association `` single nucleotide polymorphism '' ( SNP ) gene cod specific coagulation- , fibrinolysis- , inflammatory , relevant protein phenotypic expression - Association relevant phenotype coagulation , fibrinolysis , inflammation , relevant pathway risk disease - Association frequency specific SNPs cod coagulation- , fibrinolysis- , inflammatory , relevant protein risk VTE Materials Methods : - 300 woman history VTE pregnancy 150 woman IUFD identify Norwegian patient registry ( NPR ) Medical Birth Registry ( MFR ) . The medical record patient check . The epidemiological data collect help questionnaire patient fill blood sample collect . Blood sample analyze aim check know coagulation factor thrombophilias well new gene polymorphism . - 600 control woman , maternity ward Ullevål/Aker University Hospitals time period , match age ethnicity , also answer questionnaire donate blood sample . The medical record woman check . Ethical problem : This study raise new ethical problem . The study base voluntary participation invite informed consent analyze biological test material . The study design , data procedure store biological material , use method assure patient privacy level . The participant invite fill questionnaire concern information thrombosis pregnancy take one simple blood test . Women symptoms post thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) offer clinical examination low extremity verify condition . The data de-identified individual able identify concession patient register establish study . Blood test store biobank Ullevål University Hospital ( UUS ) establish study , use research relate problem study . Some patient could psychological reaction illness experience many year ago . The project leader co-worker Hematology Department/Research Laboratory handle problem . These patient offer additional information thrombosis pregnancy .</detailed_description>
