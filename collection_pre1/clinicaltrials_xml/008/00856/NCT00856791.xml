	<brief_summary>ON 01910.Na undergone preclinical clinical phase I study show activity patient progress ovarian cancer resistant platinum-based chemotherapy . This study look large population patient determine whether treatment ON 01910.Na effect progression free survival rate patient platinum-resistant ovarian cancer . ON 01910.Na give intravenous infusion 2 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 28-day cycle . Patients treat 6 cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect 2-h Infusion ON 01910.Na Ovarian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II single arm study ON 01910.Na administer 2-hour infusion biweekly patient progressive ovarian cancer resistant platinum-based therapy . The primary objective evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . The secondary objective document measure outcome [ objective response rate ( ORR ) , duration response , duration stable disease , overall survival ( OS ) ] , tolerability study drug . Thirty-seven ( 37 ) patient progressive ovarian cancer resistant platinum-based therapy enrol single arm study treat ON 01910.Na administer 2-hour infusion Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 18 28-day cycle . Patients treat disease progression withdrawal cause ( unacceptable toxicity , patient investigator decision ) ON 01910.Na . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE v3.0 ) . Progression-free survival , objective response , duration response , duration stable disease assess use RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumor ) guideline , well overall survival . Grades 3 4 hematologic toxicity , grade &gt; 2 non-hematologic toxicity monitor . A futility analysis perform 17 evaluable patient enrol evaluate overall objective response . If 3 few objective response ( CR PR ) observe , study close accrual deem futile . An extension study additional 25 week complete monitoring consider patient progress week 25 . The ON 01910.Na dose use study ( 2-hour infusion 2400 3200 mg twice weekly 3 week 4-week cycle ) select base maximum tolerated dos activity document phase 1 protocol .</detailed_description>
