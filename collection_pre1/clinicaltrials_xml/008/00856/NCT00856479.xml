	<brief_summary>We invite individual , diaphyseal fracture ( broken bone ) non union participate research study . A non-union lack bone healing ( bone growth break bone occur ) 3 month operation . The diaphyseal area specific bone ( usually near middle ) fracture occur . The bone interested clavicle ( collar bone ) , tibia ( low leg ) , femur ( upper leg ) , humerus ( upper arm ) forearm ( low arm ) . Treatment goal type fracture minimize late surgery , assist heal process , decrease time heal . The ability patient non-union ( lack bone heal 3 month post operation ) return work force normal activity quickly good financial impact society ( community ) , also improve over-all physical mental well-being patient . `` Infuse '' synthetic bone morphogenic protein mean ability help bone form heal inserted fracture site . `` Infuse '' may first commercially available product approve Health Canada accelerate heal long bone non-unions require surgical intervention . Although safety efficacy Infuse demonstrate numerous pre-clinical study , human clinical trial need evaluate safety power produce effect product particularly respect non union long bone . The purpose study evaluate safety power produce effect Infuse implant treatment long bone non union reduce later surgery require augment heal process accelerate time heal . Given , orthopaedic community plan study order scientifically establish effective treatment method restore function type injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Cost Study Infuse BMP 2 v Iliac Crest Autograft Non Union Long Bone Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose multi-centre Canadian randomize Study wherein 80 patient randomize ( put group standard pattern ie . flip coin ) receive autograft ( sample bone : iliac crest ) allograft ( bone chip bone bank ) `` infuse '' ( synthetic bone morphogenic protein ) allograft use lock plate . Locked plat surgical plate place fracture screw lock plate completely screw bone hole plate . Our objective ass total cost patient treat study group benefit Infuse compare new bone formation fracture site . We monitor critical aspect operative care rehabilitation regular interval , 2 year surgery . We independently monitor revision surgery ( surgery repair previous surgery ) rate . We also assess patient functional health quality life outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion eligible entry study : ) Patients must require open surgical treatment nonunion diaphyseal fracture tibia , humerus , femur , radius ulna sustain secondary trauma . c ) Patients must candidate surgical treatment intramedullary nail lock unlocked plate . ) Patients must fracture diaphysis define specific bone . e ) Patients must show radiographic evidence skeletal maturity ( closed epiphyseal plate ) . Patients follow criterion , eligible entry study : 1 . Patients require mechanical fixation Intramedullary nailing plating ( i.e . external fixation ) 2 . Patients fracture fall outside diaphysis define specific bone question , i.e . metaphyseal fracture . 3 . Patients segmental circumferential bone loss &gt; 4cm . 4 . Patients whose fracture result tumour 5 . Infection per se , result exclusion must treat soft tissue envelope close prior randomization 6 . Patients know metabolic bone disease ( osteoporosis ) would negatively impact bone heal process . 7 . Patients know sensitivity collagen . 8 . Patients pregnant breastfeeding time study enrolment . 9 . Patients currently treat radiation , chemotherapy , immunosuppression , steroid therapy . 10 . Patients receive investigational drug treatment . 11 . Patients injuries condition unable communicate consent ) Patients know breast prostate cancer f ) Patients must able willing provide inform consent , complete study assessment , follow period study .</criteria>
