	<brief_title>Autonomic Correlates Impulsivity Preschool Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assessing biological marker ADHD among preschooler potential elucidate biology-environment interaction , may important implication treatment , understand etiology ADHD . Although impulsivity highly heritable , long-term change biological system implicate impulsive behavior effect intervention show 61 % increase electrodermal activity 6-8 year later at-risk preschool child randomize intervention condition compare control randomize treatment condition . Early intervention may therefore essential dysregulated trajectory respond within system prevent and/or alter . Atomoxetine ( ATMX ) block NE transporter ( NET ) , increase extracellular level NE throughout brain . It first nonstimulant drug approve FDA treatment ADHD . Recent clinical study show ATMX significantly reduce symptom ADHD observe parent teacher . ATMX show improve response inhibition ADHD . In proposed research , pre- post-treatment bio-behavioral autonomic marker impulsivity assess preschool child ADHD participate double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled crossover treatment selective NET inhibitor , atomoxetine , placebo .</detailed_description>
