	<brief_summary>Respiratory difficulty one primary factor lead death patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) Multiple Sclerosis . Both disease progressive degenerate disease cause difficulty breathe , airway protection swallow . Patients PD MS typically become sedentary lose endurance , maximal fitness level overall pulmonary function . Much research focus motor symptom PD MS yet pulmonary swallowing complication perhaps ultimately important disability diseases progress . The inability generate adequate respiratory pressure responsible reduce cough magnitude cough response time . Cough critical clearance foreign material airway help reduce infiltration bacteria subsequent respiratory infection . With reduced cough function increase risk pulmonary disease occurs due reduce ability protect airway . There number promising outcome expiratory strength-training program . By increase expiratory muscle strength expiratory pressure generation , effective breathing , clearance airway , improve swallowing occur . These explicit outcome predict base experience use innovative device-driven , home-based expiratory strength training program focus expiratory muscle respiration . This project focus follow patient PD MS initial 5 week strength train test outcome caregiver program maintaining treatment effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expiratory Muscle Training Persons With Neurodegenerative Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose investigation : Determine 5 week Expiratory Muscle Strength Training ( EMST ) increase maximal expiratory driving pressure ( MEP ) improve swallow , cough breathing function individual PD MS . Following post assessment 5 week EMST program evaluate three different module monitor continuation treatment assess patient quality life caregiver burden/satisfaction . This help u determine one particular home training method result different physiological functional outcome . Aim 1 . Determine effect EMST program swallow function , voluntary cough production breathe function individual PD MS identify normal limit age sex ( via physiological measure ) . Hypothesis 1 : There significant positive treatment effect follow 5 week EMST measure swallow , cough production breathe function PD MS follow 5 week treatment . Aim 2 : Determine outcome three uniquely structure home treatment monitor program maintain EMST post treatment effect patient MS PD . These program refer : Education Module ( A ) , Question Only ( B ) , Education Module plus Question ( C ) . The monitoring system provide VitelNet , lead provider home health monitoring , clinician-based telemedicine Hypothesis 2 : Program C provide great maintenance EMST treatment effect patient group compare program A B . Aim 3 : Determine effect home monitoring program improve patient quality life caregiver burden/satisfaction . Hypothesis 3 : Program C provide great improvement patient quality life caregiver burden compare program A B .</detailed_description>
