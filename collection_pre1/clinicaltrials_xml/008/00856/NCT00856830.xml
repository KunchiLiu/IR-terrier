	<brief_summary>SCLC constitute approximately 15 % 170,000 new case lung cancer diagnose annually United States ( 1 ) . Extensive-Stage SCLC comprise two third new case generally consider sensitive chemotherapy , despite median time progression 4 month ( 2 ) . SCLC one aggressive lethal type cancer , median survival 9 month ( range 7-11 month ) patient diagnose extensive disease ( 3 ) . Overall , majority patient SCLC die less 2 year ( 2-year survival rate generally less 10 % ) , 5-year survival rate 2.3 % patient extensive disease ( 4 ) . The regimen etoposide combination platinum ( cisplatin carboplatin ) generally consider `` standard care '' although recent Phase III trial suggest improved survival combination cisplatin/irinotecan ( 5 ) . Further evaluation new agent combination regimens attempt overcome intrinsic drug resistance see extensive-stage SCLC warrant attempt improve survival achieve palliation disease-related symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine With Irinotecan Followed Etoposide/Carboplatin Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose novel combination bendamustine plus irinotecan follow standard regimen etoposide carboplatin . This allow investigation response novel combination well improvement outcome compare historical control .</detailed_description>
