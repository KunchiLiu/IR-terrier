	<brief_summary>Background : - Obesity lead number health problem , include diabetes , heart disease , stroke , low back pain , fatty liver disease , osteoarthritis . The medical treatment currently available obesity limit . - Exenatide injectable medication approve treatment Type 2 diabetes cause weight loss diabetic subject . If exenatide work weight loss nondiabetic person know . Objectives : - To determine whether nondiabetic obese individual treat exenatide compare treat placebo lose great amount weight body composition change 24-week period , whether loss body composition change maintain 24-week extension period . - To determine whether exenatide lead decrease food intake . - To determine whether change caloric intake correlate exenatide-induced change stomach empty time . - To determine effect exenatide energy expenditure . - To determine effect exenatide carbohydrate versus fat use body energy need . - To determine effect exenatide activity level . - To determine whether exenatide alters hormonal level , association change energy intake expenditure , future weight loss , percent body fat change . - To determine whether exenatide alters responses behavioral test via questionnaire specifically address dietary restraint stress-related eating behavior relationship change food intake , hormone level , weight loss , fat loss . - To assess tolerability safety profile exenatide nondiabetic obese subject . Eligibility : - Nondiabetic men ( premenopausal ) woman age 18 55 year body mass index great 30 kg/m ( 2 ) live Phoenix , AZ area . Design : - Participants admitted initial 16-day period research unit , follow occur : - Instructions lifestyle change promote weight loss - Questionnaires determine eating-related behavior attitude toward food - Laboratory test determine glucose tolerance , body composition , stomach emptying time , hormone level , energy expenditure food intake start study medication - Instructions self-injecting exenatide placebo via medication pen - Instructions use blood glucose monitor log - Following release , participant self-administer set dose either exenatide placebo 2 time per day 24 week . Participants know whether receive exenatide placebo . - Outpatient visit occur weekly first 4 week every 4 week , weight loss , compliance self-medication , side effect , lifestyle modification assess . - Participants readmitted metabolic unit 24th week study , study initial stay repeat . - Participants wish continue 24-week open-label extension period see outpatient describe initial part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Exenatide ( Byetta ) Energy Expenditure Weight Loss Nondiabetic Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity lead number health problem include diabetes , heart disease , stroke , low back pain , fatty liver disease , osteoarthritis . The medical treatment currently available obesity limit . Exenatide injectable medication approve treatment type 2 diabetes cause weight loss diabetic subject . The reason exenatide think cause weight loss include decrease food intake , increase feeling fullness nausea . Because level human gut hormone ( glucagon like peptide 1 ) similar exenatide show related rest energy expenditure , also possible exenatide may effect person metabolism , a.k.a . energy expenditure , effect exenatide energy expenditure yet evaluate . Even though exenatide use treat diabetes , administration exenatide non-diabetic lean individual cause frankly low blood sugar . The primary goal study investigate way exenatide give twice day obese ( BMI &gt; = 30 kg/m^2 ) people without diabetes might lead weight loss . Because response weight loss treatment highly variable individual , look role exenatide change food intake energy expenditure possible explanation weight loss . We also assess safety profile exenatide non-diabetic obese people . This study involve use exenatide placebo , determine randomly , obese individual without diabetes 5 week period . The primary measurement include effect exenatide energy expenditure food intake . We also look change body fat level hormone involve sensation hunger fullness . We assess exenatide-induced change predict individual lose weight 5 week . The safety side effect exenatide non-diabetic individual time also determine . Findings study would help determine exenatide work cause weight loss people without diabetes , might benefit , would help improve understanding people respond good weight loss treatment others .</detailed_description>
