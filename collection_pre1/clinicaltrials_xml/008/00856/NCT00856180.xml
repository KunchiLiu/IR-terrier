	<brief_title>Sequential Angiogenic Blockade Treatment Recurrent Mullerian Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess efficacy sequential antiangiogenic blockade regimen bevacizumab cyclophosphamide bevacizumab disease progression patient recurrent ovarian cancer measure proportion patient remain study three month ( 4 cycle ) - Assess safety profile respect gastrointestinal perforation Secondary - Assess toxicity/ safety profile metronomic antiangiogenic approach - Assess preliminary response rate proportion patient study 6 month - Assess progression-free survival , time progression overall survival Correlative - Determine biological correlate angiogenesis alter addition sequential therapy - Determine change biological marker correlate clinical state cancer - Determine whether biomarkers angiogenesis predict measure response - Determine whether oncogenic mutation predict response - Determine whether hypertension urinary biomarkers vary level albuminuria predict response bevacizumab - Determine patient risk factor hypertension proteinuria toxicity bevacizumab STATISTICAL DESIGN : This study use two-stage design evaluate safety efficacy sequential antiangiogenic blockade regimen bevacizumab cyclophosphamide add disease progression . Safety measure incidence grade 3-5 gastrointestinal perforation ( GIP ) first 3 month therapy efficacy completion least 3 month therapy . The sample size determine base efficacy null alternative therapy completion rate 50 % 80 % , respectively . If 6 patient enrol stage one cohort ( n=9 patient ) complete least 3 month therapy accrual would proceed stage two ( n=11 patient ) few 2 case grade 3-5 GIP . There 0.75 probability stop trial stage one true therapy completion rate 50 % . If 13 few patient remain therapy least 3 month end stage two , regimen would deem ineffective . The power reject null hypothesis one-sided binomial test 87 % assume 5 % significance .</detailed_description>
