	<brief_summary>The present study aim evaluate relationship level SCI impairment Colonic transit time ( CTT ) Total transit time ( TTT ) use SmartPill device . The SmartPill , FDA approve device , wireless capsule ingest transmits value GI pH , temperature , pressure travel throughout digestive system . The SmartPill also use assess CTT TTT . In compare value CTT , TTT , pH , temperature , pressure SCI patient healthy , able-bodied control , SmartPill device may provide valuable insight pathophysiological implication SCI GI function . This information may allow medical professional provide effective plan care population , subsequentially enhance quality quantity life . The SmartPill device may also provide less invasive alternative assess variable , compare traditional modality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Total Transit Time Total transit time ( TTT ) simply amount time ( hour ) take meal travel mouth , digestive tract waste by-product eliminate bowel movement . Inter-individual TTT vary greatly due dietary habit , age , climate , exercise habit , immobility , medication lifestyle variable . Due multiple variable , general TTT public determine . It clear however , healthy person total transit time range 8 14 hour , result one three loose bowel movement every 24 hour . People good physical condition , consume fiber-rich diet , take constipate medication likely normal TTT . Colonic transit time ( CTT ) amount time take partially digest meal travel terminal ileum , large bowel waste by-product eliminate bowel movement . There several way measure TTT . Each require ingest track device tracer monitor move throughout digestive system . Total transit time traditionally measure use radiopaque markers1 . This technique simple inexpensive perform radiology department . Several method suggest , include single-marker bolus technique ( ingestion marker specific day follow several x-rays marker pass ) multiple-marker bolus technique ( ingestion marker day several day follow single multiple abdominal x-ray ) . Radiopaque marker widely use measure total transit . This technique provide valuable clinical information proven reliable reproducible . Scintigraphy use alternative radiopaque marker technique measure TTT . The tagged material surround substance dissolve arrive colon . Another technique widely use past Hydrogen Breath Test measure transit time meal mouth cecum . The meal reach colon indicate rise relative hydrogen content exhale air2,3 . While many valid GI assessment technique exist , many invasive impose many inconvenience patient . A relatively new device , SmartPill , offer ability assess many GI variable include temperature , pressure , pH , transit time minimize invasive nature investigation . The SmartPill small wireless capsule ingest patient . Values pressure , temperature , pH transmit continuously capsule receiver carry patient capsule excrete normal evacuation . This information download onto master computer express graphically comparative purpose . Purpose measure TTT Measuring TTT useful evaluate patient constipation , abdominal bloating , refractory irritable bowel syndrome . It provide quantitative information total transit , enable identification characterization transit abnormality , allow assessment severity problem well response therapy . Disorders Affecting TTT Intestinal Motility Disorder ( IMD ) may due primary secondary cause depend endogenous exogenous etiology . This would include several asymptomatic condition , maldigestion , achalasia , alkaline bile reflux duodenum stomach . Intestinal pseudo-obstruction ( Ogilvie syndrome ) , irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , fecal incontinence , constipation condition relate disordered intestinal motility . Many common drug ( tricyclic antidepressant , diuretic , laxative , lithium salt , vinca alkaloid , chemotherapy agent , etc . ) may interfere intestinal motility receptor level interfere parasympathetic nervous system , largely control GI motility . Drugs benzodiazepine , lithium salt , laxative , codeine cause secondary stasis4 . The latter produce narcotic bowel syndrome , usually observe patient abuse opiate chronic pain . Endocrine disorder , myxedema , also cause gastrointestinal obstruction due decrease thyroid hormone level well imbalance sodium potassium metabolism . CTT SCI patient The magnitude bowel dysfunction spinal cord injury patient document several study . Spinal cord injury affect colorectal motility , transit time , bowel emptying , often leading constipation , fecal incontinence combination two . Although symptoms life-threatening , may negatively impact quality life well increase level anxiety depression5 . Abnormal bowel function one bothersome problem patient SCI . While know bowel dysfunction affect quality life , research examine pathophysiological cause bowel dysfunction limit . Moreover , study provide partial information bowel dysmotility , focus CTT anal dysfunction , rather identify comprehensive neurogenic bowel pattern accord different neurological abnormality clinical manifestation . Constipation , obstructive defecation , fecal incontinence know frequent complication SCI . However , presence severity homogeneous patient depend integration mechanism abdominal compression , colorectal motor activity , anal sphincter function well digitalization bowel evacuation . Paralleling complication , CTT increase SCI subject compare normal population . Recent clinical study individual SCI identify prolonged CTT 57 % subjects6 . While study investigate correlation intestinal symptom level SCI , relationship intestinal symptom change CTT evaluate . While several study identify prolonged CTT SCI patient , investigation produce consistent findings7 , 8 . The present study aim evaluate multiple variable GI function patient SCI able-bodied control use SmartPill device . In compare value TTT , CTT , pH , temperature , pressure patient SCI healthy , able-bodied control , SmartPill device may provide valuable insight pathophysiological implication SCI GI function .</detailed_description>
