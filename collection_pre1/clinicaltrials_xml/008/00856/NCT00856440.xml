	<brief_summary>Periodic screen colon cancer become standard care individual age 50 . In context , generally accept colonoscopy sensitive modality detection colon cancer and/or pre malignant colon pathology . As currently perform , however , colonoscopy require stool eliminate colon examination . If stool remain colon , visualization bowel partially completely impaired limit effectiveness screen . A number method employ purge bowel waste material generally involve either administration lavage ( like flush ) solution ( Colyte Golytely ) osmotic laxative ( sodium phosphate magnesium citrate ) . Neither approach uniformly effective individual neither without potential complication , especially kidney . It intent propose research study relative efficacy safety preparation able-bodied individual well people spinal cord injury . To end , randomize group lavage solution , laxative combination two prior routine , clinically indicate colonoscopy . The quality preparation directly assess colonoscopy effect preparation kidney function determine . We suspect come preparation colonoscopy , one shoe fit size . The propose research allow u determine form preparation least harmful achieve optimal effectiveness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy routine evaluation screen colorectal cancer people 50 increase genetic risk . Despite large number individual require screening , little randomized , control research determine relative renal safety oral colon preparation solution use evacuate bowel patient `` normal '' kidney function , best frequency laxative dosing ( e.g . 1 day vs. 2 day ) , quality colon cleanse result different approach . Reports acute renal failure , secondary nephrocalcinosis , follow commonly use oral phosphosoda preparation increasingly recognize . It belief project yield clinically relevant information would immediate clinical application person receive colonoscopy . Since preparation screen colonoscopy involve vigorous purge stool individual without GI complaint , also represent opportunity study prevalence clostridium difficile ( C. diff ) population . This may reveal important information regard epidemiology increasingly virulent common enteric pathogen . A pilot screen program asymptomatic C. diff , common nosocomial pathogen , may reveal finding clinical importance prevent spread infection , allow use presumptive treatment period increase risk .</detailed_description>
