	<brief_summary>Magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate phosphate binder absorbs phosphate food , reduce amount body absorb . The purpose study assess efficacy magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate subject require hemodialysis , compare marketed phosphate binder , lanthanum carbonate placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Study Investigate Safety Efficacy Fermagate Lanthanum Carbonate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High level phosphate blood link serious effect , due calcium imbalance ( high level parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , bone disease , formation calcium deposit body blood-vessel disease . Current guideline indicate blood phosphorous level maintain 1.13 1.78 mmol/L patient receive hemodialysis . This 2-stage re-randomization design Stage 1 randomize , open label comparison fermagate lanthanum carbonate ( non-inferiority design ) Stage 2 randomize double blind comparison fermagate placebo ( superiority design ) . Objectives Stage 1 : Primary Objective : The primary objective establish efficacy fermagate demonstrating noninferiority ( possible assessment superiority ) fermagate lanthanum carbonate lower serum phosphate hemodialysis patient . Secondary objective : The secondary objective : 1 . Determine safety fermagate hemodialysis patient . 2 . Compare effect fermagate lanthanum carbonate measure mineral metabolism , albumin , pre-albumin iron status . Objectives Stage 2 : Stage 2 use patient complete 3-month maintenance period Stage 1 originally randomize fermagate . Primary Objective : The primary objective establish efficacy fermagate demonstrating superiority fermagate placebo lower serum phosphate hemodialysis patient . Secondary objective : The secondary objective : 1 . Determine safety fermagate hemodialysis patient . 2 . Compare effect fermagate placebo measure mineral metabolism , albumin , pre-albumin iron status .</detailed_description>

( ) Subject receive phosphate binder medication ( ) screening , must stable regimen ( dose medication ) least 1 month prior screen remain regimen entry washout period OR ( b ) Subjects ( ) currently receive phosphate bind medication screening ( medication likely act phosphate binder ) ( ii ) must do least one month ( iii ) sustain hyperphosphatemia . 6 . Willing abstain take phosphate binder oral magnesium , oral aluminum oral ironcontaining product preparation study medication . 7 . If require take &gt; 6000 mg/day fermagate , subject willing least three meal per day . Specifically , randomization inclusion treatment period , one follow criterion must fulfil : 8 . ( ) Is receive phosphate binding medication screen screen serum phosphate value 3.0 mmol/L ( 9.3 mg/dL ) OR ( b ) Has serum phosphate value ≥1.94 mmol/L ( ≥6.0 mg/dL ) Washout Visit 2 4 3.0 mmol/L ( 9.3 mg/dL ) visit 1 washout . Exclusion : Subjects consider eligible entry study meet one follow criterion . 1 . Participation clinical trial use investigational product device 30 day precede Screening Visit . 2 . Previous experience fermagate treatment . 3 . A significant history alcohol , drug solvent abuse opinion investigator . 4 . Any disease condition , physical psychological , opinion investigator , would compromise safety subject likelihood achieve reliable result increase likelihood subject withdrawn . 5 . Laboratory finding screen , opinion investigator , clinically significant subject population . 6 . A screen serum magnesium concentration &gt; 3.0 mg/dL ( &gt; 1.25 mmol/L ) . 7 .
