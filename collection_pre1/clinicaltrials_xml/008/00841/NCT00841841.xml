	<brief_title>Dipyrone Versus Acetaminophen Control Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patient schedule surgical removal impact third molar Discipline Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Traumatology Dental School Araçatuba , São Paulo State University , Brazil , select study review approval research protocol institutional Research Ethics Committee ( Protocol # 2006-01083 ) . All patient receive verbal write explanation study purpose procedure , sign informed consent form prior enrollment . Patients good general health fulfil follow criterion exclude : systemic disorder ; know hypersensitivity study medication ; pregnancy nursing ; local contraindication surgery judge oral surgeon ; use analgesic agent 24 hour surgery . All patient premedicated oral dexamethasone 4 mg one hour surgery modulation postoperative edema . The surgical procedure perform single operator accord standardized surgical protocol compliance principle surgical technique . All patient receive standard verbal write postoperative instruction regard diet , oral hygiene general care . The patient randomly assign 2 group 15 patient , accord drug prescribe postoperative medication : Group I : dipyrone 500 mg every 6 hour ( 4 male , 11 female , mean age = 25.2 year ) Group II : paracetamol 750 mg every 6 hour ( 3 male , 12 female , mean age = 26.8 year ) . Amoxicillin 500 mg prescribe patient . All surgery complete within 1 hour perform local anesthesia injection average volume 3.6 mL 2 % mepivacaine 1:100,000 adrenaline per surgical site . No relevant perioperative complication observe . In Group I , 3 maxillary right third molar , 9 maxillary leave third molar , 10 mandibular leave third molar 9 mandibular right third molar extract . The following impaction position observe : vertical ( n=22 ) , horizontal ( n=4 ) medio-angulated ( n=4 ) . During surgery , osteotomy necessary 2 surgical site osteotomy associate tooth section require 8 case . In Group II , 1 maxillary right third molar , 9 maxillary leave third molar , 12 mandibular leave third molar 3 mandibular right third molar extract . The following impaction position observe : vertical ( n=18 ) , horizontal ( n=2 ) medio-angulated ( n=3 ) . During surgery , osteotomy , tooth section osteotomy associate tooth section perform 6 , 3 6 case , respectively . Pain intensity rat patient use 4-point visual analog scale ( VAS ) : 0 ( pain ) , 1 ( mild pain ) , 2 ( moderate pain ) , 3 ( severe pain ) , 4 ( unendurable pain ) . Measurements pain intensity perform immediate postoperative period every 6 hour surgery complete 48 hour . Reports relief different pain intensity obtain patient pre-established interval ( 6 hour ) use ordinal scale order obtain mean pain intensity score patient group . The use nonparametric statistical test thus require data comparison . Mann-Whitney test use compare study group analyze mean pain intensity score obtain every 6 hour , first 24 hour , final 24 hour total 48-hour period . Significance level set 5 %</detailed_description>
