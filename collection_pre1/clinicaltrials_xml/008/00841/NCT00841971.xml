	<brief_title>Anidulafungin Versus Fluconazole Prevention Fungal Infections Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number well characterized risk factor show portend high risk opportunistic mycoses liver transplantation . Retransplantation renal failure amongst significant risk factor invasive fungal infection patient . Most Invasive fungal infection high-risk patient occur within first month posttransplant . Studies utilize universal prophylaxis primarily employ fluconazole . A recent meta-analysis prophylactic trial document beneficial effect morbidity attributable mortality , emergence infection due non-albicans Candida spp . patient receive prophylaxis . The availability echinocandins lead expanded armamentarium antifungal drug potentially promise role agent target prophylaxis invasive fungal infection high-risk liver transplant recipient . Anidulafungin unique amongst echinocandins eliminate body almost exclusively biotransformation slow non-enzymatic degradation blood , without hepatic metabolism renal elimination . Anidulafungin demonstrate good safety profile . We hypothesize anidulafungin effective well tolerate antifungal prophylactic agent setting .</detailed_description>
