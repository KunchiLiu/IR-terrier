	<brief_title>Sulindac Preventing Melanoma Healthy Participants Who Are Increased Risk Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine sulindac metabolite level healthy participant atypical nevi benign nevus increase risk melanoma treat sulindac versus placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect sulindac apoptosis atypical nevus participant . II . To assess effect sulindac VEGF expression atypical nevus participant . III . To assess sulindac metabolite level plasma association drug level target tissue . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Participants randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Participants receive oral sulindac twice daily . ARM II : Participants receive oral placebo twice daily . In arm , treatment continue 8 week absence unacceptable toxicity . Blood tissue sample collect baseline and/or completion study therapy analyze sulindac metabolite level via high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ; detection apoptotic cell via TUNEL assay ; VEGF expression via immunohistochemistry assay . After completion study therapy , participant follow 2 week .</detailed_description>
