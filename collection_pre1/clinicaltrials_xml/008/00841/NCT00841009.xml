	<brief_summary>Obesity affect 43 million Americans associate increase incidence heart failure , sudden death , cardiovascular death . We show increase obesity independently associate potentially detrimental LV structural functional , metabolic change . Thus order increase understand effect obesity heart , wish study effect significant weight loss parameter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Gastric Bypass-induced Weight Loss Myocardial Structure , Function Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty obese patient weigh &lt; 350 # , weight limit PET table , undergo gastric bypass enrol study . Written , informed consent approve Institutional Review Board Washington University School Medicine obtain subject his/her participation study . Subjects compensate time . Subjects undergo Medical Screening ( Visit 1 ) consist comprehensive medical evaluation : history ( questionnaire ) , physical examination , EKG , blood chemistry , kidney function , complete blood count , lipid profile pregnancy test woman childbearing age . Subjects weigh &lt; 300 # fat-free mass ( body composition ) determine use machine call DEXA . Measurement Insulin Resistance ( Visit 2 ) : Subjects undergo hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp nonradiolabeled glucose infusion order define level insulin resistance total body glucose turnover . This study perform GCRC . Measurement Myocardial Metabolism , Efficiency , Structure , Function Measures Total Body Fatty Acid Metabolism ( Visit 3 ) : Subjects admit GCRC even PET image 6 pm receive standard meal . The next morning 18-gauge intravenous catheter insert arm vein . A catheter ( small tube ) also place radial artery total body fat metabolism measurement &amp; blood pressure monitoring . If subject wish , may Foley place urination PET scan study . Myocardial PET image . Studies perform fasting condition 8 end 1:00 pm . Each subject position within scanner , 2-min data collection acquire verify proper position 5-min . scan performed generation attenuation correction factor . Heart blood flow , oxygen consumption , measure fat metabolism obtain use PET image sequential injection radiolabeled tracer report previously group . Blood pressure heart rate monitor continuously record throughout image acquisition . During scan , 5 blood sample ( 0 , 2 , 10 , 20 , &amp; 30 min ) obtain measurement hormone , heart fuel ( e.g . fat , lactate ) carbon dioxide level . Anonymous Genetic Tissue Data Sampling : Draw store 1 tablespoon subject 's blood , period 10 year , use future study screen difference gene related heart membrane protein heart energy metabolism ( include limit gene know KV1.5 , KV2.1 , PPAR , FATP , ACS , PGC-1 ) . Echocardiography : Immediately follow PET image oxygen consumption determination , subject undergo complete 2D- , 3D- , Doppler echocardiographic examination . Optison Definity , depend availability , clinically use intravenous contrast agent may administer aid acquisition ultrasound image . Total body fatty acid metabolism measurement : Simultaneous PET imaging , subject undergo infusion tracer amount nonradioactive fat measurement total body fat metabolism . Blood sample drawn predetermine time measurement . 3 Months s/p Gastric Bypass Surgery ( Visit 4 ) . Blood sample 1 Year s/p Gastric bypass Measurement Body Composition , Blood Chemistries , Lipid Levels , Insulin Resistance ( Visits 5 6 ) . After subject undergone gastric bypass clinical reason weight stable 2 week ( approximately 1 year post-gastric bypass ) .</detailed_description>
