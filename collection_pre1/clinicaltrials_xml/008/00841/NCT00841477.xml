	<brief_summary>The goal propose study use HBV vaccine model future HIV vaccine trial , examine efficacy community-based outreach intervention well accelerated vaccine schedule method increase acceptance/adherence HBV vaccination protocol among not-in-treatment drug user . This study also examine effect HBV vaccination couple community-based outreach intervention reduce incidence HIV , HBV HCV infection frequency needle use sexual risk behavior related viral transmission . A secondary purpose ass antibody response HBV vaccination measurement immunological response drug user .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project evaluate HBV vaccination program model future HIV vaccine efficacy trial community-based study drug user . Two component analyzed effort increase vaccine acceptance/adherence - behavioral intervention &amp; accelerated vaccine schedule . The study also examine effect variable risk behavior incidence HIV , HBV , &amp; HCV infection . To accomplish objective , propose randomized behavioral intervention field trial . We enroll 1600 current cocaine heroin user negative HBV &amp; HIV marker two closely match , low-income , high drug endemic community Houston . All participant offer HBV vaccination follow-up viral testing . One community randomly assign receive outreach behavioral intervention design increase vaccine awareness vaccine compliance . The community receive standard care . Participants elect vaccinate randomize either 0,1,6 month 0,1,2 , month vaccine schedule . Groups follow two year determine rate HBV vaccine acceptance/adherence 3-dose protocol . We also measure change risk behavior &amp; incidence HIV/HBV/HCV infection well HBV vaccine immune response , vaccinate . Drug user large group newly diagnose HIV case create model HIV vaccine 's acceptance adherence population important public health goal . This study serve model future HIV vaccine trial provide information effectiveness outreach program increase immunization among drug user . Unless effective model base upon empirical experience develop , attempt implement HIV vaccination program among drug user likely frustrate . If HBV vaccination couple outreach intervention reduce risk behavior decrease incidence HIV/HCV infection , study tremendous impact current HBV/HIV/HCV prevention strategy .</detailed_description>
