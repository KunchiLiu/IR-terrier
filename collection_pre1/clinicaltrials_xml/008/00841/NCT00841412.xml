Research staff collect baseline measure relate organizational characteristic , include staffing , nutritional care process resident outcome include oral food fluid intake weight status . All LTC unit two site divide two group program implementation purpose ( total 4 group across 2 site ) base proximity unit unit , resident staff characteristic . The program implement staff resident unit first site/group ; , second site/group remain usual care continue monitor monthly care process resident outcome measure . Research staff train LTC staff implementation program protocols 12-week intervention period . Research staff monitor LTC staff implementation program monthly follow intervention determine sustainability program absence research staff . All staff train monitoring repeat LTC unit group three four . The intent program evaluation study determine effectiveness cost translate efficacious research protocols care practice improve nutritional status LTC veteran .
