	<brief_title>A Safety , Efficacy Pharmacokinetic Study Siltuximab ( CNTO 328 ) Participants With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2-part , Phase 1/2 , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , multiple-dose dose-escalation study intravenous ( directly vein ) siltuximab participant malignant solid tumor . The study test safety effectiveness experimental drug , siltuximab , participant advance cancer ( abnormal tissue grow spread body ) . This study also test siltuximab clear body body react . For reason blood test perform characteristic tumor analyze . Siltuximab give intravenous infusion ( fluid medicine deliver vein way needle ) 1 hour . In Phase 1 ( Cohort 1-4 ) dos administer range 2.8-15 milligram per kilogram ( mg/kg ) . Cohort 5 Phase 1 receive recommend dose schedule determine Cohort 1-4 . Participants Phase 1 ( Cohort 1-4 ) receive 4 administration siltuximab 10-13 week period , participant Cohort 5 Phase 2 receive 12 administration 33 week period . Follow-up visit 12 week last dose schedule . Participants may contact 1 year last dose follow-up survival disease status information . Efficacy primarily evaluate per response evaluation criterion solid tumor ( RECIST ) criterion . Participants ' safety monitor every visit .</detailed_description>
