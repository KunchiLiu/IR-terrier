	<brief_summary>The search metabolic abnormality patient neurological disorder represent important challenge 1 ) identify new potentially treatable inherit metabolic disease , 2 ) identify biomarkers new treatment common neurodegenerative neurogenetic disorder . This approach currently limit fact technique aim identify abnormal metabolite human fluid ( metabolomics ) detect subset molecules general assay available detect abnormality metabolism complex molecule take place within cell organelle . As consequence , limited part metabolism study simultaneously . The aim study evaluate whether NRM spectroscopy body fluid ( urine , cerebrospinal fluid ) could allow detect new metabolic abnormality patient complex neurological disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It establish inborn error metabolism may present adulthood neurological disorder . The diagnosis diseases essential , unlike so-called neurodegenerative disease , metabolic disease often accessible specific treatment . Conversely , many patient follow complex neurological disease unknown cause . We hypothesize significant proportion patient carry yet undetected inborn error metabolism . Recently , use Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( NMRS ) uncover new metabolic disease lead sometimes specific treatment . However , place technique investigation patient complex neurological disease remain determined . The primary goal project assess interest NMRS urine CSF search metabolic abnormality , detect conventional biochemical technique . It open study . The study conduct close collaboration neurology genetic department Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital , one hand nuclear medicine department Poitiers . 250 patient included period 2-3 year divide 4 group : Group 1 : patient complex neurological disease unknown cause ( 200 patient ) urine CSF collect . Group 2 : positive control ( 25 patient ) : patient already know metabolic disease already CSF urine . Group 3 : negative control ( 25 patient ) : patient non metabolic neurological disorder know cause hospitalize lumbar puncture .</detailed_description>
