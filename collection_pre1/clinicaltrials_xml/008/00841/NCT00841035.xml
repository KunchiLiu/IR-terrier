	<detailed_description>Our current clinical trial proposal include short course pre-operative , single agent erlotinib follow post-operative erlotinib-gemcitabine neo-adjuvant/adjuvant approach treatment patient resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma . The short course pre-operative erlotinib treatment serf two objective : 1 ) erlotinib , cytostatic effect , may hinder ability tumor cell metastasize time surgical resection minimal toxic effect delay surgical treatment ; 2 ) true effect erlotinib potential determinant response best assayed pancreatic cancer since model well resemble patient authentic tumor microenvironment . The post-operative treatment component protocol attempt improve demonstrate effect gemcitabine add erlotinib adjuvant setting , drug combination , mention , already proven advantageous patient advance pancreatic cancer . Traditionally , chemotherapy cancer conduct empiric fashion first select regimen base clinical trial evidence clinical parameter , assess objective response regimen employ clinical radiographic imaging mean . This approach suffer many disadvantage , conspicuously inability select well patient candidate prior initiation therapy , thus spar risk expense ineffective treatment patient unlikely respond . Since pancreatic cancer expression EGFR protein predictive therapeutic response , alternative method patient selection seem essential success EGFR-targeted treatment . The understanding EGFR molecular signaling allow drug development process shift empiric random screen approach rational mechanistic , target-directed approach . Among multiple attempt identify molecular determinant tumor cell sensitivity EGFR inhibitor , two main paradigm stand : 1 ) activation downstream pharmacodynamic effector associate response drug ( i.e . phosphorylation Akt extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) ; expression c-fos ) , 2 ) prediction sensitivity base `` static '' analyte ( detection epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) sensitize mutation ; epithelial-mesenchymal transition profile ) . However , give complexity factor govern pancreatic cancer response erlotinib , biologic heterogeneity malignant phenotype , overall relatively low response rate , believe unlikely analysis single biomarker useful patient selection . A comprehensive analysis dynamic panel biomarkers relevant EGFR signal erlotinib mechanism action seem useful sense . Furthermore , limited ability pancreatic cancer tissue sample often preclude biomarker correlation assay work xenograft model in-vitro condition . The translational rationale proposal therefore develop predictive chemotherapy sensitivity-resistance assay ( CSRA ) pancreas carcinoma patient treat erlotinib gemcitabine . This represent major advance , CSRA would enable prediction clinical response prior initiation therapy .</detailed_description>
