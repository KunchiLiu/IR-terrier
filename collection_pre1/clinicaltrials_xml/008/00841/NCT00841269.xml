	<brief_summary>The purpose study see investigational medication uridine reduces depression symptom adolescent bipolar disorder . Uridine naturally occur chemical make human liver . Uridine part family compound call pyrimidine , normally involve many body 's process use energy cell . Uridine consider experimental , approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat bipolar depression adolescent . The study use standard method assess adolescent 's mood , rating scale questionnaire . In addition , study use Magnetic Resonance Imaging Spectroscopy ( MRI/MRS ) brain scan see level certain chemical brain change adolescent treat uridine . These scan use magnet create image brain , expose patient radiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label study investigational drug uridine treatment adolescent depression bipolar disorder . Uridine show positive result Phase II study bipolar disorder adult ( http : //clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00322764 ) . This study enroll 30 depressed adolescent participant meet DSM-IV-TR criterion bipolar disorder type I , type II bipolar disorder otherwise specify . Participants currently take psychotropic medication ( ) continue current regimen , uridine add adjunctive therapy . Participants untreated informed alternative study participation . This include inform parent ( ) guardian ( ) Lithium , Risperdal Abilify FDA-approved treatment adolescent bipolar disorder would available child community care . The study three objective : 1 ) To use Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) brain imaging measure level beta-nucleoside triphosphate ( b-NTP ) anterior cingulate cortex 30 adolescent bipolar disorder , before-and-after 6 week treatment investigational drug uridine ; 2 ) To measure antidepressant response uridine 30 participant Children 's Depression Rating Scale ( CDRS ) ; 3 ) To acquire structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) data 30 participant bipolar disorder 30 healthy control , establish regionally-specific structure/neurochemical relationship . Adolescent participant bipolar disorder treat uridine 500mg twice daily six week . The primary clinical outcome measure Children 's Depression Rating Scale ( CDRS ) , response define 30 % reduction CDRS score . In addition standardize clinical assessment , participant undergo magnetic resonance image magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRI/MRS ) brain scan baseline , six week treatment uridine . This novel approach design explore objectively measurable biomarkers illness treatment response pediatric bipolar disorder . The investigator hypothesize participant whose depression respond uridine demonstrate increase concentration beta-nucleoside triphosphate ( b-NTP ) anterior cingulate cortex . This would support hypothesis depressive state associate abnormality brain energy metabolism . As neuroimaging comparison group participant bipolar disorder , 30 healthy adolescent control history psychiatric illness recruit MRI/MRS scanning . The investigator hypothesize control high level b-NTP anterior cingulate cortex participant depression associate bipolar disorder , support connection brain bioenergetics depression .</detailed_description>
