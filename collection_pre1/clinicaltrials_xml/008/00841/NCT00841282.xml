	<brief_summary>Our aim perform randomized-controlled trial compare air insufflation sedate colonoscopy ( conventional method ) vs. water infusion sedate colonoscopy ( study method ) supervise trainee . Randomized trial demonstrate reduce need sedation medication without compromise patient ' comfort , cecal intubation rate polyps detection may cause paradigm shift positively alter way traditional colonoscopy perform future endoscopists train .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT Air Insufflation Versus Water Infusion Colonoscopy Supervised Trainees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : A novel water method permit 52 % patient accept on-demand sedation complete colonoscopy without medication significantly increase successful cecal intubation 76 % 97 % patient accept schedule unsedated colonoscopy . Aim : To perform randomize controlled trial compare air insufflation ( conventional method ) vs. water infusion lieu air ( study method ) colonoscopy minimally sedate patient supervised trainee . Hypothesis : Compared conventional method , patient examine study method lower pain score require less medication similar cecal intubation rate willingness repeat future colonoscopy . Setting : Outpatient colonoscopy single VA hospital Methods : After inform consent standard bowel preparation , patient receive pre-medications administer 0.5 increment Fentanyl ( 25 Î¼g ) 0.5 increment Versed ( 1 mg ) plus 50 mg Diphenhydramine . The conventional study method colonoscopy implement previously describe . Additional pain medication administer patient ' request . Outcome measure : Increments medication , pain score , cecal intubation willingness repeat colonoscopy . Limitations : Single VA site , old male population</detailed_description>
