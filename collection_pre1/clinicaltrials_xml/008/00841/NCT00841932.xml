	<brief_title>Performing Fractional Flow Reserve Without Anticoagulation During Diagnostic Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An experienced interventional cardiologist perform FFR brief period time . This procedure safely perform without anticoagulation , thereby lower associate procedural risk avoid bleed groin complication may occur anticoagulation . Performing FFR without anticoagulation may also decrease facility cost femoral artery closure perform use standard protocol diagnostic procedure , instead standard protocol interventional procedure patient anticoagulated . Performing FFR without anticoagulation increase risk injury coronary artery thrombus coronary artery .</detailed_description>
