	<brief_summary>The purpose study follow : 1 . To assess safety document local systemic toxicity peptide vaccine ( E75 ) 2 . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) optimal biologic dose ( OBD ) peptide vaccine 3 . To evaluate vivo cellular immune response peptide vaccine 4 . To evaluate time recurrence vaccinate patient vs. match control</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study HER2/Neu ( E75 ) Vaccine Node-Positive Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common malignancy second common cause cancer-specific death among woman United States . Despite advance diagnosis treatment breast cancer , one third woman develop disease die disease , account approximately 46,300 deaths/year . While good primary therapy available treat early stage breast cancer , substantial failure rate therapy advance disease . Advances understand immune response cancer lead genesis immunotherapeutic approach . Specifically , development anti-cancer vaccine hold promise adjuvant preventive therapy patient primary surgical medical treatment breast cancer , high risk recurrence . Patients great four lymph node positive 87 % chance recurrence post standard surgical medical therapy 10 year . While patient hormone receptor positive tumor option undergo hormonal therapy , recurrence especially high among estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor ( ER/PR ) negative patient . For patient , currently good treatment option completion primary therapy ; close surveillance watchful wait standard . It population patient vaccine strategy induce cellular immunity would target . We propose vaccinate patient immunogenic peptide HER2/neu protein . If successful , vaccine strategy could utilize adjuvant currently accept first line therapy future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
