	<detailed_description>A double-blind , single centre comparative study fourteen group 40 male female adult &gt; 18 year age randomly allocate receive 1.7 , 5 , 15 45 Âµg quantity whole virion ( WV ) , Aluminium -adjuvanted WV ( Al-WV ) , virosomal ( V ) influenza A/Hong Kong/1073/99 ( H9N2 ) vaccines intramuscular injection deltoid muscle ; 5 15microg WV vaccine administer intradermal injection . A second dose vaccine contain quantity antigen first dose administer 21 day later . Subjects observe local systemic reaction 30 minute immunisation ( day 0 21 ) , monitor reaction adverse event 7 day immunisation . Blood immunogenicity study obtain day 0 ( pre-immunisation ) , day-21 ( +4 day ) , day-42 ( i.e. , 21 +4 day second immunization ) . Immunogenicity evaluate haemagglutination inhibition , virus neutralization , , single radial haemolysis , neuraminidase inhibition cellular mediate response ( subset 5-10 subject group ) .</detailed_description>
