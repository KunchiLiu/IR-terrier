	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer That Has Spread Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine objective response rate brain 2 course sunitnib malate patient previously untreated recurrent brain metastasis secondary renal cancer follow radiotherapy surgery . Secondary - Evaluate duration response . - Evaluate objective response non-CNS target . - Evaluate time disease progression . - Evaluate overall progression-free survival . - Evaluate neurological symptom associate tumor . - Evaluate feasibility overall tolerance drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily 4 week . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
