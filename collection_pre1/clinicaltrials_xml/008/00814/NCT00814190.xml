	<brief_summary>Management diabetes evolve challenge health care professional . The fluctuation glucose level lifetime patient diabetes lead complication nephropathy , neuropathy , retinopathy cardiovascular disease . Although diabetes chronic disease , control use medication ( pill insulin ) , and/or change life-style diet . These intervention aim keep blood glucose level normal range acceptable level . An important aspect diabetes care monitor blood glucose level order ass effectiveness treatment modify treatment achieve desirable glucose level . Patients type 2 DM treat insulin recommend perform test blood glucose level ; however , often require intervention health professional order prevent immediate serious complication hyper hypoglycemia . The frequent self-monitoring blood glucose effective intervention health professional may eventually allow tight control blood glucose level delay prevent complication associate diabetes . In study , investigator wish evaluate effect Internet base remote monitoring system allow patient upload blood glucose reading online health care professional view provide feedback therapeutic intervention . The Internet base system feature present blood glucose reading accord time day automatically calculate daily average plus standard deviation . A visual graph glucose reading 24-hour period also generate view . In addition , doctor give feedback send message system . The patient 's personal information keep secure outline privacy policy Internet base system doctor patient view upload glucose reading . The investigator propose standardized encounter use Internet improve outcome treatment patient type 2 DM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Internet Therapeutic Intervention A1C Levels Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( DM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To determine whether use Internet-based glucose monitoring system improve A1C level patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . Hypothesis : We propose standardized encounter patient health care profession use Internet improve outcome treatment patient type 2 DM . Justification : The standard treatment involve glucose monitoring test blood glucose 3 time daily , perform laboratory test blood hemoglobin every three month , visit doctor every three month standard care . All subject standard care ; however , half also use Internet system report glucose reading allow health care professional view result provide feedback . Research Method : Type 2 diabetes patient satisfy inclusion criterion recruit St. Paul 's Diabetes Teaching Training Centre . They randomize 2 group ( Intervention Control ) . There equal chance , 50/50 chance , place either group . The control subject group receive standard care ask perform self-blood glucose monitoring 3 time daily 6 month . The control subject group also make visit endocrinologist every 3 month laboratory test A1c serum creatinine measurement 3-month interval 6 month . The Intervention group also receive standard care ask perform self-blood glucose monitoring 3 time daily 6 month . However , Intervention group also ask report blood glucose reading every 2 week Internet base glucose monitoring system . The Intervention group also make visit endocrinologist every 3 month A1c serum creatinine measurement 3-month interval 6 month . The laboratory measurement group record use data analysis . Statistical Analysis : The primary endpoint A1c level change A1c level . The secondary endpoint include severe hypoglycemia define require external aid , hospital admission CVD relate intervention , adverse event unplanned hospitalization cause last 24 hour . Patients required number SBGM test perform patient require new laser therapy ask discontinue study . For group , A1C level start study compare A1C level 3 6 month start study . Paired t-tests random effect model ( longitudinal analysis ) examine difference A1C value study duration . Unpaired , independent t-tests do examine difference A1C value two group intervention . The planned sample size 50 .</detailed_description>
