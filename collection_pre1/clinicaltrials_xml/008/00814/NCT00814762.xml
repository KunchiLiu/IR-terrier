	<criteria>All subject must satisfy follow criterion screen vaccination : A male female , age include 1855 year time first vaccination . Known HIV1 infect care HIV physician minimum 6 month . However , subject initially present primary HIV infection need diagnose care 12 month . Written inform consent obtain subject prior study procedure . Subjects investigator believe comply requirement protocol . If subject female , must nonchildbearing potential , childbearing potential , must practice adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test continue precaution throughout duration study . CD4 count ≥ 450 cell per mm³ Additional inclusion criterion subject enrol first cohort ( HIVinfected subject receive HAART ) : Stable highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) least one year . Undetectable viral load Additional inclusion criterion subject enrol second cohort ( treatmentnaïve HIVinfected subject ) : HAARTnaïve ( never receive antiretrovirals HIV diagnosis ) VL 500080000 copies/mL screen Commencement HAART expect base current assessment within next year . The following criterion check time screen vaccination . If apply , subject must include study : Infection HIV2 Had AIDS define illness ( CDC Classification ) . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) within 30 day precede first dose study vaccine/placebo , plan use investigational nonregistered product study vaccine study period . Drug therapy immunomodulators steroid within three month precede first dose study vaccine/placebo plan administration study period Administration immunoglobulins and/ blood product within three month precede first dose study vaccine/placebo plan administration study period . Planned administration vaccine foreseen study protocol period start 30 day first dose study vaccine/placebo end Month 4 It recommend vaccination history subject review health care provider encourage fully vaccinate accord country vaccination schedule HIV infect person enrolment study . Concurrently participate another clinical study , time study period , subject expose investigational noninvestigational product ( pharmaceutical product device ) . Any previous vaccination immunotherapy HIV . History immune reconstitution disease commence antiretroviral therapy ( HIVinfected subject receive HAART ) A family history hereditary immunodeficiency . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine . Acute chronic infective hepatitis ( A past history hepatitis B C exclusion criterion ) . Acute chronic , clinically relevant pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic renal functional abnormality , determine physical examination laboratory screen test . Pregnant lactate female . Female plan become pregnant planning discontinue contraceptive precaution . Any condition ( include alcohol drug abuse ) , opinion investigator , could compromise subject 's safety adherence study protocol History medically confirm autoimmune disease History malignancy , squamous cell basal cell skin cancer , unless surgical excision consider achieved cure Asthma require daily steroid long act ß agonist prevention Unstable asthma define : Sudden acute attack occur less three hour without obvious trigger .
