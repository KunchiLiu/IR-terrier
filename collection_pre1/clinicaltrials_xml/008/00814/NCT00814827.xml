	<brief_summary>Opportunistic infection cause bacteria , mycobacteria , fungi virus normally cause infection people healthy immune system . Some infection cause public health concern , especially area limited access treatment . People acquire opportunistic infection usually diseases affect immune system , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , enough white blood cell fight infection . However , people acquire opportunistic infection even though normal amount white blood cell free know disease harm immune system . This study investigate reason otherwise healthy people get opportunistic infection learn people likely . This study include 210 HIV-negative male female older 18 year age opportunistic infection . The patient draw multiple site Thailand Taiwan include Khon Kaen University Hospital , Siriraj Hospital , Ramathibodi Hospital , National Taiwan University Hospital , National Cheng-Kung University Hospital Patients undergo initial evaluation include physical examination , medical history , blood urine testing . Additional test conduct researcher consider test medically necessary treat opportunistic infection ; result test review save study purpose . Depending severity infection , initial evaluation may take 1 day complete . After evaluation , patient give standard appropriate medicine treat infection . Patients return follow-up visit allow researcher monitor condition ass well patient respond treatment . Patients evaluate study researcher least year 2 year follow initial treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mycobacterial Opportunistic Infections HIV-Negative Thai Taiwanese Patients Associated With Autoantibodies Interferon-gamma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acquisition opportunistic infection causally link innate acquire immunodeficiency . We recently identify population Asian woman autoantibody interferon gamma ( IFN ? ) , diagnose virtue nontuberculous mycobacterial infection . Similar patient population report Thailand , find similar autoantibody anonymous serum sample . In addition , many Thai patient disseminate lymphatic nontuberculous infection opportunistic infection ( OI ) , salmonella , penicilliosis , histoplasmosis . However , normal lymphocyte count human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) negative . Therefore , identification autoantibody critical cytokine , occurrence opportunistic infection , lack common explanation suggest important population study . We propose enroll patient natural history study non-HIV opportunistic infection explore presence autoantibody cytokine , examine potential immunogenetic factor influence development disease . Plasma , cell , DNA sample obtain store use study . This study accrue 210 patient 3 year per group describe section 4.3</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must meet follow criterion time evaluation eligible enrollment study cohort : Group 1 ( NTM alone ) : 1 . Past current infection NTM proven culture specific DNA detection presence compatible clinical picture judge responsible clinician PI site . 2 . NTM felt iatrogenic ( indwell catheter associate postoperative wound infection ) 3 . HIV negative within 3 month either prior diagnosis OI , prior enrollment study , HIV status unknown time OI 4 . No evidence active malignancy 5 . No systemic corticosteroid time diagnosis OI ( define great 4 week dose great 10 mg per day prednisone within 3 month prior diagnosis NTM ) 6 . No preexist immune deficiency Group 2 ( nonNTM OI without NTM ) : 1 . Patients must prove infection one follow organism : disseminate Salmonella , Listeria , Penicillium , Burkholderia pseudomallei , Cryptococcus , Histoplasma , Herpes zoster involve 2 noncontiguous dermatome , extradermal involvement opportunistic infection list , relevant , determined PI . 2 . Patient may infection NTM addition one infection ( ) . 3 . HIVnegative within 3 month either prior diagnosis OI , prior enrollment study , HIV status unknown time OI diagnosis 4 . No evidence active malignancy 5 . No systemic corticosteroid time diagnosis OI ( define great 4 week dose great 10 mg per day prednisone within 3 month prior diagnosis NTM ) 6 . No preexist immune deficiency Group 3 ( diseased control pulmonary MTB ) : 1 . Active pulmonary MTB , i.e . patient sputum either culture positive MTB AFB positive respond therapy MTB . 2 . Diagnosed past 6 month . 3 . No concurrent infection due NTM OI list inclusion criterion study subject 4 . No clinical evidence HIV Group 4 ( diseased control disseminate MTB ) : Disseminated MTB include infection involve great equal 2 noncontiguous site , one may include pulmonary disease great equal 2 separate group lymph node . 1 . Active disseminate MTB cure disseminate MTB 2 . No concurrent infection due NTM OI list inclusion criterion study subject 3 . HIV negative within 3 month either prior diagnosis MTB , prior enrollment study , HIV status unknown time MTB diagnosis 4 . No evidence active malignancy 5 . No systemic corticosteroid time diagnosis OI ( define &gt; 4 week dose &gt; 10 mg per day prednisone within 3 month prior diagnosis NTM ) 6 . No preexist immune deficiency . Group 5 ( Blood Specimen Donors ) : Eligibility criterion applicable . Blood collect volunteer , medical evaluation perform . To blood donor person exclude per exclusionary criterion : 1 . Patient &lt; 18 &gt; 85 2 . Weight &gt; 45 kg ( 99 lb ) 3 . Receiving chemotherapy cancer 4 . Receiving immunosuppressant medication 5 . Have history heart , lung , kidney disease bleed disorder . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude follow reason : 1 . HIVpositive serostatus group 1 , 2 4 ( group 3 5 routinely perform HIV test ) 2 . Active malignancy 3 . Medical condition require immune modulate therapy ( i.e . corticosteroid , biological agent , antimetabolite ) /or chemotherapy 4 . Any medical condition unsuitable study determine principal investigator 5 . Age le 18 year 6 . Receiving investigational study agent enrol study .</criteria>
