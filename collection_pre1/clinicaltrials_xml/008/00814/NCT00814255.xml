	<brief_title>Novel Therapies Resistant FSGS ( FONTII ) : Phase II Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS A significant percentage patient primary FSGS resistant corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication . In view rise incidence disease grim prognosis patient resistant disease , imperative new therapeutic approach evaluate efficient systematic manner . This enable accurate assessment risk-benefit ratio novel therapy guide design future Phase III randomize clinical trial . Specific Aim # 1 : To evaluate two novel therapy resistant FSGS -- anti-TNF-α antibody galactose -- standard therapy Specific Aim # 2 : To identify one novel agent candidate future study Phase III randomize clinical trial OVERALL STUDY DESIGN Screening/Run-In : There formal run-in period phase II trial patient resistant FSGS eligible study often unstable kidney function prone sudden decline glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . An effort make achieve randomization within 2 week screen visit . In order achieve comparable baseline assessment prior initiation one novel therapy , patient must immunosuppressive medication 30 day . In addition , patient place maximal tolerated dos angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) , angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) , lipid-lowering drug define base upon measurement blood pressure , serum K+ , creatinine , cholesterol concentration . Patients stable dos ACEI/ARB treatment minimum 2 week prior randomization FONT Phase II study insure initiation novel therapy coincide hemodynamically induced change proteinuria . In order implement part conservative medical therapy , 2-12 week Screening/Run-In period precede randomization . Rescreening necessary patient randomize one three treatment arm within 12 week initial screen assessment . Duration novel therapy : Novel therapy administer 6 month assess efficacy , i.e. , &gt; 50 % reduction proteinuria . Although novel therapy target renal fibrosis , anticipated period treatment sufficient document beneficial effect proteinuria . Screening/Run-In : There formal run-in period phase II trial patient resistant FSGS eligible study often unstable kidney function prone sudden decline GFR . An effort make achieve randomization within 2 week screen visit . Frequency visit : Patients evaluate 0 , 2 , 8 , 16 , 26 week treatment novel therapy conservative medical therapy alone . Thus , total 6 visit treatment period . A follow-up evaluation perform 1 month , 3 month , 6 month discontinuation novel therapy , every 6 month end funding period . Baseline study 1 . Interval History physical examination 2 . Urine protein creatinine excretion Proteinuria ( Up/c ) express protein : creatinine ratio ( mg : mg ) early morning specimen . 3 . Serum creatinine calculate GFR , glucose , albumin , pregnancy test 4 . A urine , plasma , serum DNA sample collect storage NIDDK FSGS-CT Biorepository . A request make store residual renal tissue collect clinical indication FONT trial NIDDK Biorepository . Follow-up assessment : Week 2 , 8 , 16 Visits 1 . Interval history , physical examination , assessment adverse event 2 . First morning urine protein excretion 3 . Laboratory analysis chart . Urine pregnancy test 8 16 week visit Final Outcome Visit ( Week 26 ) 1 . History physical examination 2 . Morning urine protein creatinine excretion x 2 ( The value represent average two sample collect week visit . ) 3 . Serum creatinine calculate GFR , Serum Na+ , K+ , HCO3 , Cl- , glucose , CPK 4 . Blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , albumin , cholesterol , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase , complete blood count ( CBC ) , antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) , C3 level , pregnancy test 5 . Urine , serum plasma biorepository 6 . TSQM patient questionnaire Preliminary safety , patient tolerance , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data two novel therapy , rosiglitazone adalimumab , use Phase II trial generate successful performance Phase I study . In phase I study , total 21 patient enrol . 11 assign receive rosiglitazone , 10 assign receive adalimumab . The patient evenly divide gender pubertal stage . All patient GFR &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 . There serious adverse event necessitate withdrawal study drug . Rosiglitazone stop one child due questionable allergy . The patient tolerate experimental medication adequately base result Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Medication ( TSQM ) administer week 16 . The PK analysis indicate rosiglitazone dose need increase account increase clearance reduce area curve patient resistant FSGS nephrotic range proteinuria . For adalumimab , clearance also enhance especially receive multiple dos . However , result adalimumab PK analysis indicate dose adjustment require . The PK data drug present abstract form annual meeting American Society Nephrology manuscript summarize complete finding patient treat rosiglitazone submit publication . This Phase II rely considerable investment time resource part study investigator NIH/NIDDK gain FSGS-CT ( UO1-DK-63455 ) Phase I portion FONT study ( DK70341 ) . Schneider Children 's Hospital ( SCH ) University North Carolina-Chapel Hill ( UNC ) resource include GCRCs utilized R21phase study available R33 portion FONT project .</detailed_description>
