	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Tapentadol Immediate Release ( IR ) Oxycodone IR Treatment Acute Post-op Pain Following Elective Arthroscopic ( Surgery Using Thin Flexible Scope ) Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind ( neither patient study doctor know name assign study drug study ) , randomize ( study drug select chance like flip coin ) , active-comparator ( patient get active drug inactive drug ) , outpatient study evaluate efficacy well patient tolerates multiple dos tapentadol immediate release ( IR ) versus oxycodone IR short-term moderate severe post-operative pain arthroscopic ( surgical technique whereby doctor insert tube-like instrument joint visually inspect repair tissue ) shoulder surgery . About 370 patient enrol either receive tapentadol IR oxycodone IR approximately 150 patient treatment group enrol . After obtain informed consent , patient screen visit procedure determine study eligibility . Visit 1 ( screen ) may begin 21 day prior surgery . Pre-operative assessment ( e.g. , physical examination , clinical laboratory assessment ) conduct part routine procedure . Patients urine drug test woman able child urine pregnancy test perform part screen prior study . Height weight take sleep questionnaire also complete screen . Study staff conduct pre-operative teach regard post-operative pain include : pain intensity assessment study ( 11-point numeric rating scale 0=no pain 10=pain bad imagine ) ; description mild , moderate severe pain ; instruction dose study medication ; complete study diary . Eligible patient post-operative men woman undergone elective outpatient arthroscopic shoulder surgery . Patients must receive regional interscalene ( within scalene muscle ) nerve block primary anesthetic ( numbing medication ) procedure require intravenous ( vein ) patient-controlled analgesia post-operatively . Patients expect moderate severe acute post-operative pain shoulder surgery appropriate candidate outpatient pain management oral opioid ( narcotic ) pain medication eligible . In addition , appropriate patient expect require oral opioid pain medication post-operatively . Patients continue meet study criterion post-operatively assign study drug group prior PACU discharge ( PACU consider Visit 2 ) send home study medication . All patient prescribe standard regimen cold pack application surgical shoulder . Patients instruct take first dose study medication first oral pain medication least `` moderate '' pain ( prior discharge home ) . Patients remind instruction post-operative pain discuss pre-operative screening visit . Patients also instruct complete diary assessment current pain intensity take first dose study medication . Day 1 calendar day patient take first dose study medication . Starting Day 1 , patient instruct complete assessment paper diary morning evening relate pain intensity , pain relief , occurrences vomit . All patient contact telephone member study staff day follow surgery . The staff verify first dose study medication take baseline pain intensity assessment record . All patient receive second telephone call study staff Day 3 . During telephone call , site personnel inquire patient 's overall status reinforce diary compliance . If study staff determines necessary , patient require return study site unscheduled visit . Patients may take 2 pill ( form ) acetaminophen pain post-operative shoulder pain ( e.g. , headache , back pain ) per day total 2 day study . Patients take 325 mg/day aspirin prevention heart condition permit enter study continue study medication provide stable dose least 1 month prior study entry plan continue dose study . Patients complete study return study site final visit ( Visit 3 ) Day 7 . Patients discontinue early reason ( i.e. , lack efficacy , adverse event , patient 's choice ) contact study staff take supplemental pain medication schedule his/her final visit . Patients complete final assessment pain intensity pain relief . In addition , patient complete sleep questionnaire , Patient Global Impression Change assessment satisfaction treatment . The study doctor complete Clinician Global Impression Change record medical resource utilization note office chart ( e.g. , unplanned call subject , unscheduled office visit , emergency room visit ) . Vital sign obtain study medication collect count . Patients adverse event assess change concomitant medication ( medication take time study medication ) record . All patient post-study medication prescribe study doctor 's discretion . A patient may elect take supplemental pain medication treat post-operative shoulder pain time study ; however , patient take supplemental pain medication consider discontinue study . Patients assign chance equally ( 1:1 ) blind ( neither patient study doctor know ) fashion get tapentadol immediate release ( IR ) 50 100 mg v oxycodone IR 5 10 mg , every 4-6 hour need . Treatment 7 day start Day 1 one capsule study medication . A `` re-dose '' permit may administer soon one hour first dose . For subsequent dos , patient may take one two capsule every 4 6 hour need .</detailed_description>
