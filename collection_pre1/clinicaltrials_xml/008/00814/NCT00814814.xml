	<brief_summary>Management cardiac arrest complicate lack readily available tool identifying individual likely successfully resuscitate . S100 beta protein originate astroglial cell brain , NSE ( Neuron Specific Enolase ) another protein originate neuron . In laboratory , concentration protein correlate evidence brain damage head trauma , stroke exposure low level oxygen . The concentration proteins blood human survivor cardiopulmonary resuscitation human much high patient resuscitate survive . However , still unclear whether survivor cardiopulmonary resuscitation high level protein blood survive neurological injury secondary arrest resuscitation . Hypothesis : In human , blood concentration protein S100 beta NSE resuscitation predict die despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation survive neurological injury secondary arrest resuscitation .</brief_summary>
