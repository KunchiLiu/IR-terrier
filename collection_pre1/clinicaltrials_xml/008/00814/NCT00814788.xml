	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , bicalutamide , may lessen amount androgen make body . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study bicalutamide everolimus see well work compare bicalutamide treat patient recurrent metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bicalutamide With Without Everolimus Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To compare PSA response rate patient hormone-independent recurrent metastatic adenocarcinoma prostate treat bicalutamide everolimus first-line androgen deprivation therapy . - To evaluate time treatment failure overall survival patient . - To assess toxicity bicalutamide everolimus patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease status ( metastatic disease vs biochemical recurrence without measurable disease ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Patients receive oral bicalutamide oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28-42 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
