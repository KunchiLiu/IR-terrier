	<brief_summary>Warfarin effective prevention blood clot ( thrombosis ) . A test coagulation , prothrombin time ( PT ) use monitor effect . The PT response warfarin fluctuate result interaction large number drug , food herbal agent well apparent reason . Thus , frequent monitoring PT dose adjustment accord result require . One third patient remain maintenance dose 6 month . However , also patient sometimes PT result moderately outside therapeutic range without obvious explanation . Too short PTs may due miss dose ( ) dark green vegetable diet . Too long PTs may due course antibiotic therapy less dark green vegetable . Laboratory error may also occur cause deviation direction . Most likely , unnoticed fluctuation PT occur well time point monitor . There guideline manage treatment situation typical `` behaviour '' . Behavior A : Some physician simply let patient continue dose . `` It extremely unlikely temporary dose adjustment effect PT result 4 week later `` cosmetic procedure '' . '' Behavior B : Others recommend patient take Â½ - 1 additional dose case short PT skip dose take half dose case long PT , thereafter continue usual dose . `` The investigator need quickly correct temporary aberration order avoid thrombotic bleeding complication next day . This may seem like issue importance . The investigator however perform series study evaluate stable patient manage blood test less often every 4 week . For purpose important know often aberrant result occur , implication extent ignore . The investigator hypothesis patient stable PT-results unchanged dose 3 month , continue exactly maintenance dose , even result unexpectedly slightly therapeutic range . The investigator believe occasional PT-results outside therapeutic range due laboratory error , perhaps missed dos patient temporary change diet medication .</brief_summary>
