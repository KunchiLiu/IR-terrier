	<brief_summary>People acute respiratory failure usually require use artificial breathing machine , know mechanical ventilator . Sedative medication , help keep people calm reduce anxiety , often prescribed child mechanical ventilator . However , longer sedative medication use , long child may need remain mechanical ventilation . This study evaluate effectiveness team approach sedation management aim reduce number day child acute respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sedation Management Pediatric Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure ( The RESTORE Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People hospitalize acute respiratory failure typically support mechanical ventilation , delivers oxygen continuous level pressure damage lung . Over 90 % infant child support mechanical ventilation receive form sedation medication , help keep safe , calm , comfortable . Unfortunately , use sedation medication may prolong duration mechanical ventilation , lead increase risk pneumonia complication . Recent study among adult intensive care unit ( ICUs ) show doctor nurse work together team manage use sedation medication , patient take mechanical ventilation sooner few side effect . This team strategy include follow : - Training discussion doctor nurse regard sedative medication use - Having doctor nurse jointly identify patient 's progress daily sedation medication goal patient - Having nurse use decision-making tool help guide change patient 's sedative medication dose - Keeping track patient care , allow doctor nurse evaluate effectiveness manage patient 's sedative medication use This study examine use sedation management strategy infant child pediatric ICUs acute respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation . The purpose study evaluate whether team approach sedation medication management effective usual approach reduce amount time child remain mechanical ventilator . Study researcher also examine cost-effectiveness approach associate quality life factor . All participant enrol within 24 hour start mechanical ventilation monitor receive last dose sedative medication , hospital discharge , Day 28 ( whichever come first ) . During 3-month baseline period , participate pediatric ICUs provide usual sedation management , study researcher review participant ' medical record daily basis . Each pediatric ICU randomly assign either control group team approach group . Pediatric ICUs control group continue provide usual care sedation management . Pediatric ICUs team approach group implement team approach sedation management guideline . For group , pain sedation level monitor daily , study researcher review participant ' medical record daily basis , . Six month hospital discharge , half participant parent complete follow-up survey take part telephone interview ass quality life , psychological factor , health-related resource use .</detailed_description>
