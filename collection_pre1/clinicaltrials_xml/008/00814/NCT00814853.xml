	<brief_summary>Neurally adjust ventilatory assist ( NAVA ) FDA approve mode mechanical ventilation . This mode ventilation currently routine use adult , pediatric neonatal intensive care unit . The electrical activity diaphragm , large muscle use respiration , measure . The ventilator apply support proportion measure electrical activity diaphragm ( Edi ) . This electrical activity measure feed tube also multiple-array esophageal electrode . Whenever patient get extubated MSICU , conduct routine extubation readiness test . This standard care ICU . If patient fails test , patient stay ventilator . If pass , get extubated . We wish conduct study monitor electrical activity diaphragm test . If patient pass extubation readiness test , study complete . If fails , resume ventilator . In study , would use measured signal diaphragm guide ventilator . This mode ventilation call NAVA . We currently use mode ventilation ICU , could since FDA approve . However , wish use protocol gain expertise mode ventilation ICU control fashion . We wish enroll 20 pediatric patient . Patients ICU routinely variety different model ventilator . Usually , respiratory therapist determines ventilator use . All patient study would Servo-I ventilator , FDA approve ventilator capable monitoring electrical activity diaphragm currently use MSICU .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Specific Aims /Objectives Specific Aim 1 : To determine Edi predictor extubation readiness . ( Hypothesis : increase 20-50 % Edi baseline ( prior ERT ) predict successful extubation . ) Specific Aim 2 : If patient fail ERT - We hope determine NAVA provide information patient fail ERT . ( Hypothesis : decrease peak inspiratory pressure baseline ( post ERT failure ) predictive high frequency diaphragm fatigue subsequent successful ERT . 2 . Background Significance The diaphragmatic function play pivotal role patient 's ability breathe ventilator , successfulness wean ventilator extubation . However , diaphragmatic function routinely measure ICU , would like trial . When mechanical load respiratory system large continue long period time , diaphragm develop contractile fatigue [ 1 ] . This fatigue short long term . Short term also know high-frequency fatigue result accumulation inorganic phosphate [ 2 ] [ 3 ] , less extent intramuscular acidosis [ 4 ] . On hand long term fatigue , otherwise know low-frequency fatigue consistent muscle injury [ 5 , 6 ] persist day . Being able identify type diaphragm fatigue present could help u understand patient 's readiness extubated . Despite frequent use mechanical ventilation , determine appropriately discontinue mechanical ventilation extubate patient remain challenge . Many wean protocol exist typically extrapolate adult study . These protocol consist limited use sprint wean utilizing T-piece ( support , oxygen ) , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) pressure support ( PSV ) trail . Usually , data gather spirometry ventilator ( shallow breathing index , tidal volume , etc . ) vital sign record [ 7 , 8 ] . Despite use protocol extubation failure range 15-24 % ( Randolph ) pediatric population . Investigators explore physiological evidence improve lung function help determine appropriate time discontinue mechanical ventilation . One notable effort Hubble et al obtain dead space tidal volume ratio ( Vd/Vt ) determine extubation success 30 minute PSV trail prior extubation [ 9 ] . They conclude Vd/Vt ratio less equal 0.5 reliably predict successful extubation ( 96 % ) . However , provide one part equation - lung function- necessarily central nervous system interaction work breathing associate . Currently , MSICU use extubation readiness test ( ERT ) . This test determine patient eligible discontinuation mechanical ventilation . This test consist daily screen change FIO2 ( fraction inspire oxygen ) 50 % ( left current set low 50 % ) decrease PEEP 5 cmH2O . Patients unable maintain saturation ( SpO2 ) 95 % , become tachypneic , appear uncomfortable failed test ; maintain SpO2 95 % high mode ventilation change minimal pressure support ( PSV ) . Minimal PSV determine endotracheal tube ( ETT ) size . Patients classify fail test time two hour period SpO2 le 95 % , exhale tidal volume le 5 mL/kg ideal body weight , respiratory rate outside acceptable range age . If patient fails ERT return previous ventilator set evaluate extubation readiness 24 hour . It understand sedation one primary cause extubation failure , however additional concern regard diaphragmatic function . When mechanical load respiratory system large continue long period time , diaphragm develop contractile fatigue [ 4 ] . This fatigue short long term . Short term also know high-frequency fatigue result accumulation inorganic phosphate [ 5 ] , failure membrane electrical potential [ 6 ] , less extent intramuscular acidosis [ 7 ] , recover quickly . On hand long term fatigue , otherwise know low-frequency fatigue consistent muscle injury [ 8 , 9 ] persist day . Being able identify type diaphragm fatigue could lead u hold extubation readiness test re-injury . When patient extubated early , respiratory failure occur [ 10 , 11 ] . When extubation delay , lengths time mechanical ventilation ICU stay increase . This lead additional respiratory complication ventilator associate pneumonia overall lung damage [ 12 ] . Thus , decision extubate make basis accurate , objective reproducible criterion . The diaphragmatic activity likely one criterion yet measure . We aim add additional information body knowledge may link respiratory pump ( diaphragm ) lung function , muscle fatigue , and/or central nervous system depression . 3 . Preliminary Studies/Progress Report To knowledge previous data determine Edi predict extubation success . However , limited study low high-frequency diaphragm fatigue adult animal . Dr. Laghi colleague carefully examine 11 failed extubation eight adult successfully wean mechanical ventilation . They conclude wean cause low-frequency fatigue [ 13 ] . While Edi examine six health adult high frequency fatigue level . Edi find successfully assess neural drive diaphragm fatigue affect respiratory drive . Limits study mention plan address : none do child highly resistive endotracheal tube , length mechanical ventilation examine ( low vs. high frequency diaphragm fatigue risk ) , formal ERT , examination low high frequency diaphragm fatigue patient population do . 4 . Design Methods . Study Design In prospective , blind ( Edi information blind team ) clinical trail study diaphragmatic activity occur prior follow standard extubation readiness test ( minimum pressure support trial ) . We examine diaphragmatic activity examine Edi prior , , post trial every patient qualifies . Furthermore , patient fail ERT ventilate NAVA mode ventilation . The entire protocol conduct Maquet Servo I ventilator</detailed_description>
