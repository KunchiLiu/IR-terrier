	<brief_summary>The investigator wish investigate efficacy target repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) expressive language patient Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . In rTMS , magnetic pulse use noninvasively stimulate focal area cortex square centimeter area . rTMS approve United States diagnosis peripheral nerve condition . Depending frequency stimulation , rTMS preferentially stimulate inhibit cortical area . In stroke rehabilitation , example , inhibition contralateral , uninvolved hemisphere low frequency rTMS improve movement affect limbs less aberrant inhibition affect hemisphere healthy hemisphere . The effect rTMS also investigate find useful treat refractory depression depression Parkinson 's disease . In addition , rTMS improve naming patient Alzheimer 's disease improve cognitive ability memory non-demented older adult . Two study find rTMS improve aphasia patient stroke . While study small , review literature suggest may beneficial role rTMS patient chronic neurological condition . In addition , rTMS appear well tolerate , transient headache common side effect . In small open label study , investigator wish investigate usefulness bilateral stimulation brain region term dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) patient AD naming language deficit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects study recruit Dr. Devi 's clinical practice . Eligible subject must diagnosis possible probable Alzheimer 's disease use NINCDS-ADRDA criterion . The patient legally authorize representative need available sign inform consent . The assent incapable subject obtain prior enrol subject study . Once informed consent assent obtain , subject functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan brain anytime 2 week prior first study visit . At Visit 1 , subject undergo baseline battery cognitive test last approximately 30 minute . Subsequently , subject undergo rTMS . During visit , Dr. Devi locate area brain stimulate mark area scalp indelible skin marker wash time . In addition , subject provide ear plug use stimulation . This process locate area stimulate take hour occur . Then rTMS start procedure take approximately 20-30 minute ( please see full protocol complete description process ) . Each rTMS stimulation session last 30 minute , 2 consecutive day week 2 week . Both immediately prior onset first rTMS session , end fourth final rTMS session , subject test cognitive language skill . These two testing session last 30 minute . Subjects another fMRI scan anytime 2 day fourth final rTMS stimulation session . Subjects continue receive usual care throughout study period . Any change usual treatment note study file . All subject see 4 week final study treatment session undergo brief cognitive battery fMRI scan . The investigator expect recruit two subject time study subject enrol 5 week baseline visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must diagnosis probable possible Alzheimer 's disease , diagnose use standardized criterion . If subject determine PI lack decisional capacity consent study , legally authorize representative must available sign inform consent behalf subject . In case assent subject obtain well . If time subject withdraws assent , subject disenrolled study . Subjects score 30 60 item naming section Boston Diagnostic Aphasia and/or 50 % Controlled Word Association ( CFL ) Category Naming . Subjects newly diagnose AD yet receive usual care eligible . Subjects must pacemaker . They must history implant metal object . They must history seizure epilepsy . There must recent history migraine . There must history uncontrolled depression . They must medication significantly low seizure threshold . Any medical condition judge PI make rTMS unsafe subject .</criteria>
