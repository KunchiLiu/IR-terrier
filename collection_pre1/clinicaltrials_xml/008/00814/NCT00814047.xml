	<brief_summary>Blood flow autoregulation define ability tissue maintain relatively constant flow , despite moderate alteration perfusion pressure . Similar cerebral , renal , coronary skeletal muscle circulation , ocular vascular bed show property flow autoregulation . This homeostatic mechanism allow blood supply eye match metabolic demand daily activity , change posture , critical condition . Autoregulation find complex phenomenon , show heterogeneity site time course action . Since metabolic , myogenic , neurogenic possibly endothelium-related mechanism may involve , several factor may vary depend challenge stimulus , vessel tone , degree impairment autoregulation . To study dynamic ocular autoregulation , necessary introduce step disturbance ( stimulus ) ocular perfusion pressure record responses ocular blood flow continuously step disturbance . The investigator employ mechanical noninvasive technique induce ocular perfusion pressure step disturbance without drug change concentration vasoactive substance blood use thigh cuff technique induce small step decrease ocular perfusion pressure . With technique investigator could show significant difference time response blood velocity ophthalmic middle cerebral artery . This clearly indicate different mechanism responsible autoregulatory mechanism distal vessel . Interestingly result indicate ophthalmic artery late vasoconstriction occurs . Many previous investigation demonstrate sympathetic nerve stimulation cause vasoconstriction ocular circulation . Accordingly , present study test hypothesis α2-adrenoceptors involve dynamic regulation blood flow ophthalmic middle cerebral artery step decrease perfusion pressure .</brief_summary>
