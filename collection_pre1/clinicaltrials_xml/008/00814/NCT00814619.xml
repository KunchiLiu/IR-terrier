	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy use 3-dimensional ( 3-D ) image tumor help focus thin beam radiation directly tumor , give radiation therapy high dos shorter period time , may kill tumor cell few side effect . Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether give capecitabine together 3-D conformal radiation therapy effective without panitumumab treat patient advanced rectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study give capecitabine together radiation therapy see well work without panitumumab treat patient advanced rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Radiation Therapy With Without Panitumumab Treating Patients With Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess efficacy safety neoadjuvant capecitabine concurrent 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy v without panitumumab patient advance K-ras unmutated rectal cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , T stage ( T3 v T4 ) , tumor localization measure caudal part tumor anocutaneous line ( &lt; 10 cm v ≥ 10 cm ) , number EGFR gene copy ( &lt; 2.9 v ≥ 2.9 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive panitumumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 oral capecitabine twice daily day 8-40 . Beginning day 8 , patient undergo daily fraction 3-D conformal radiotherapy 5 day week 5 week . Beginning approximately 6 week completion panitumumab chemoradiotherapy , patient undergo surgery . - Arm II : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-33 . Patients undergo concurrent 3-D conformal radiotherapy 5 day week 5 week . Beginning 6 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient undergo surgery . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
