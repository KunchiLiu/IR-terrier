	<brief_title>Hepatectomy Versus Radiofrequency Ablation Hepatocellular Carcinoma Adjacent Major Blood Vessels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , serious disease high incidence home abroad still show rise trend . In recent decade , overall survival rate disease enter platform stage little advance despite diversified method treatment . The prognosis HCC satisfying . In recent year , lots clinical practice small amount evidence-based medicine show : ①.Surgical treatment still preferred choice treatment HCC . ② . The standardization comprehensive treatment put top priority current treatment HCC . Rational treatment method adopt accordance specific condition patient . The best late treatment method also provide improve efficacy large extent benefit majority patient HCC . Today , tumor remain patient therapy curative intent ( eg . surgical resection cure ) categorize system know R classification . That show : RX : presence residual tumor assess ; R0 : residual tumor ; R1 : microscopic residual tumor ; R2 : macroscopic residual tumor ; The residue application R classification refers residual tumor margin surgical excision also residue distant metastasis . The high R classification , bad prognosis becomes . Most study lead good result By percutaneous radiationfrequency ablation ( PRFA ) efficacious safe patient HCC . In patient HCC small 3cm , PRFA may comparable suegical resection long-term outcome . At present , radical resection ( final R0 R1 ) perform HCC deep complex site ( include caudate lobe HCC , 8th segment hepatoma adjacent trunk inferior vena cava , hepatic vein portal vein , etc ) often lead serious damage major blood vessel ( i.e. , hepatic vein , short hepatic vein , portal vein inferior vena cava ) hemorrhage surgery . Therefore , surgeon performs surgery near major site , excise normal liver tissue possible avoid above-mentioned hazard . However , resection margin may complete thus affect radical effect . In addition , tumor rather deep locate , lot normal liver tissue surface tumor excise massive bleeding serious damage . In view situation , surgeon adopt alternative ( PRFA rather common ) achieve efficacy similar liver excision greatly reduce risk vascular injury complication like hepatic insufficiency . However , study efficacy comparison treatment method efficacy liver excision , time recurrence ( TTR ) stage , disease-free survival overall survival condition . This study compare analyze difference hepatectomy deep complex sit patient HCC PRFA prognosis , recovery treatment well incidence complication establish treatment standard HCC site .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Identify patient HCC accordance clinical diagnostic criterion HCC pass Chines Eighth National Live Cancer Academic Conference . Patients HCC shall diagnose pathology . There least one measurable lesion . Hepatoma involve research complex site locate eighth segment liver , substantial depth liver hepatic integument adjacent trunk inferior vena cava , hepatic vein portal vein . The tumor locate hepatic caudate lobe . The maximal diameter &lt; or=3m , AJCC/UICC—TNM stage stage II . Lesions determine three senior hepatobiliary expert independently , therefore radical resection possible . There possibility extrahepatic metastasis tumor thrombus portal vein , hepatic vein , vena cava bile duct . Criteria liver function : Child A level , serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal value , alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 2 time upper limit normal value . It 's appropriate perform liver resection minimally invasive treatment . No dysfunction major organ ; Blood routine , kidney function , cardiac function lung function basically normal . Patients understand trial , male female , age 1870 voluntarily participate clinical trial sign information consent . Patients apparent cardiac , pulmonary , cerebric renal dysfunction , may affect treatment liver cancer . Patients disease may affect treatment mention . Patients medical history malignant tumor . Subjects participate clinical trial . Women pregnancy breastfeed . Patients tumor AJCC/UICC—TNM stage IIIA period .</criteria>
