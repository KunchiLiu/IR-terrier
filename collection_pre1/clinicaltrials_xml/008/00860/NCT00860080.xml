	<brief_title>Safety Study Investigating Local Tolerability Pharmacokinetics PXL01 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective investigate local tolerability safety PXL01 dose 10 , 20 , 40 mg , placebo . The secondary objective investigate pharmacokinetic property PXL01 single dos 10 , 20 , 40 mg . This single-blind , placebo-controlled , single dose administration study male healthy volunteer . Each Subject visit centre three time ; one screening visit , one dose administration visit one follow-up visit period approximately 3 week . At Visit 1 ( screen visit ) , Subject give verbal write patient information inform consent sign . Thereafter , Subject assess eligibility . Demography , concomitant medication , medical history document . A physical examination perform blood/urine collect safety analysis . Tests HIV , Hepatitis B C , drug screen alcohol breath test perform . Vital sign 12-lead ECG record . At Visit 2 ( dose administration visit ) , occur 7±3 day screen visit , Subjects first perform alcohol breath test PXL01/placebo administer abdominal subcutaneous injection . Blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis drawn , pulse blood pressure record , local tolerability assessment perform prior 15min , 30min , 45min , 60min , 1h 15min , 1h 30min , 2h , 4h , 8h 24h injection . A 12-lead ECG body temperature record prior dose , 1h , 2h , 4h , 8h 24h injection . Blood collect prior 24 hour injection . Adverse Events ( AEs ) record telemetry heart rythm monitor continuously . The Subjects stay clinic 26 hour injection . Visit 3 ( Follow-up visit ) perform 5-8 day Visit 2 . A physical examination local tolerability assessment perform . Vital sign , 12-lead ECG AEs record . Blood/urine collect safety analysis . Each group start dose two Subjects . One Subject receive placebo active treatment . If safety/tolerability concern within 48 hour , another three Subjects receive dose . Prior dose escalation , safety monitor board discus safety data . In case safety/tolerability concern , dose may discontinue .</detailed_description>
