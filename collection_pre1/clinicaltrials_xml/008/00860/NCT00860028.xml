	<brief_title>Varenicline Smoking Cessation Heavy Drinking Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking rate elevate among drinker compare non-drinkers ( Marks et al. , 1997 ) . Moreover , evidence smoker drink alcohol less successful quit smoking ( Leeman , Huffman , &amp; O'Malley , 2007 ) . Thus , identify intervention effective reduce smoke heavy drinking population warrant . Varenicline , medication recently approve FDA , result smoke cessation rate high 50 % , significantly good bupropion placebo . There preliminary experimental evidence animal human laboratory research varenicline reduce alcohol seek consumption ( McKee , 2008 ; Steensland et al. , 2007 ) . The typical dose schedule varenicline involve 1 week pretreatment phase prior quit smoking ( Gonzales et al. , 2006 ; Jorenby et al. , 2006 ; Nides et al. , 2006 ) . However , great quit rate observe 1 month use varenicline compare 1 week . Therefore , possible extended pretreatment varenicline may also yield good cessation outcomes standard 1 week lead period . This may particularly true pretreatment also reduce alcohol consumption prior quit attempt . Thirty regular smoker drink alcohol heavily receive open-label varenicline 5 week accord recommended titration schedule 1mg varenicline twice daily . Prior smoke quit date , subject randomize receive either extend pretreatment varenicline ( titration 1mg ) 4 week short-term varenicline pretreatment ( 3 week placebo follow 1 week varenicline ) . The primary aim study examine : ( ) efficacy extend varenicline pretreatment smoking cessation , ( b ) safety tolerability varenicline heavy drinking smoker , ( c ) efficacy varenicline reduce alcohol consumption human participant . Effect size estimate prolong smoke abstinence heavy drinking generate NIH grant application .</detailed_description>
