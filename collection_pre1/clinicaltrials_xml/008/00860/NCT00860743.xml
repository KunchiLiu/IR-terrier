	<brief_summary>The prevalence obstructive sleep apnea high Veteran population . If treat promptly , sleep apnea may result daytime fatigue may lead increase prevalence accident drive workplace . Recent large scale epidemiological study show prevalence excessive daytime sleepiness increase individual suffer obstructive sleep apnea . Obstructive sleep apnea may also result development hypertension cardiovascular disorder . Previous finding show subject sleep apnea great risk develop coronary vascular disease compare individual suffer sleep apnea Thus , significant amount evidence suggest sleep apnea major health concern Veteran population . Consequently , determine mechanism may impact severity sleep apnea increase prevalence cardiovascular incident associate disorder important , discover novel treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 8 % Veteran population United States suffers sleep apnea . Consequences untreated sleep apnea include increase daytime fatigue , hypertension stroke . Thus , sleep apnea major health concern . One primary hallmark sleep apnea exposure intermittent hypoxia ( IH ) occur consequence central obstructive apnea . Exposure IH may lead neural plasticity ( i.e . change system performance base prior experience ) respiratory autonomic nervous system . One adaptation show manifest animal follow exposure IH long-term facilitation ( LTF ) ventilation sympathetic nervous system activity ( SNSA ) . This phenomenon characterize gradual increase respiratory motor activity SNSA successive period normoxia separate hypoxic episode activity persist baseline level 90 minute follow exposure IH . Although LTF minute ventilation well establish animal observe consistently healthy human individual obstructive sleep apnea . Similarly , although study show exposure IH lead increase SNSA healthy individual magnitude response vary significantly . Findings animal study suggest manifestation LTF human might part dependent variety factor , include prior exposure IH , arousal state ( wake vs. sleep ) gender . Thus , initial aim proposal establish whether LTF induce healthy human individual obstructive sleep apnea whether magnitude response dependent factor mention . Moreover , initial aim explore whether presence LTF minute ventilation promote mitigates apnea severity . Animal study also indicate LTF respiratory autonomic activity may part induce increase oxidative stress . Thus , second objective proposal explore whether administration antioxidant cocktail impact respiratory autonomic nervous system plasticity wakefulness sleep follow IH . Likewise , second aim explore whether administration antioxidant cocktail alters apnea severity follow exposure IH . Establishing whether LTF minute ventilation exist individual sleep apnea important since activation phenomenon could impact apnea severity across night . Similarly , LTF SNSA activity possibly long-term depression ( LTD ) parasympathetic nervous system activity ( PNSA ) could ultimately lead persistent increase blood pressure heart rate . Furthermore , give exposure IH may lead long-term plasticity respiratory autonomic activity physiologically detrimental , explore mechanism ultimately lead treatment may mitigate prevent manifestation phenomenon important .</detailed_description>
