	<detailed_description>The purpose research develop tool help people paralyze . These tool call brain computer interface ( BCIs ) . BCIs would let person use brain signal operate technology . The investigator want make BCI use operate commercially available technology communication , environmental control computer access . The BCI would replace keyboard let people operate technology without move . However , investigator need people test BCI investigator see well replace keyboard . The investigator want understand well work investigator make useful people paralyze . The investigator ask people use BCI thing like make communication system speak type word computer .</detailed_description>
