	<brief_summary>Uterine leiomyoma ( i.e. , fibroid , myoma ) common gynecologic tumor woman reproductive age ( 1 ) . Clearly , majority lesion asymptomatic ( 2 ) . Symptoms directly attributable benign tumor represent common reason laparotomy non-pregnant woman United States ( 3,4 ) , also Taiwan ( 5 ) . Whereas decade past , hysterectomy see almost panacea uterine leiomyoma , recently attention pay development pharmaceutical agent less-invasive procedure ( 6 ) . Frequently , procedure design retain uterus ( 6 ) . Of , myomectomy may choice among uterine-sparing treatment symptomatic uterine myoma ( 7,8 ) . The surgical mode access usually employ myomectomy traditional exploratory laparotomy modificationâ€”mini-laparotomy ( MLT ) ( 9 ) ultra-mini laparotomy ( UMLT ) ( 10,11 ) , though recently , laparoscopy ( 12-14 ) combination laparoscopy MLT ( 9 ) , vaginal surgery ( 15 ) , hysteroscopic myomectomy ( 16-21 ) represent valid alternative . However , myomectomy alone provide vary degree symptom control high percentage recurrence , tumor , also symptom . For example , one study report symptom resolution vary 84.0 % 100 % depend different item 21 ( 19.4 % ) 108 patient experienced recurrence average interval 16 month ( range , 1.8-47.4 month ) ( 22 ) . Therefore , alternative additional therapy might require provide longer durable symptom control minimize tumor recurrence . One strategies laparoscopic uterine vessel occlusion ( LUVO ) , also know laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion ( LUAO ) ( 23,24 ) . The rationale use LUVO management symptomatic myoma find successful experience uterine-artery embolization ( UAE ) , introduced 1995 alternative technique treat fibroid ( 25 ) . Since become increasingly accept minimally invasive , uterine-sparing procedure , study report relief excessive menstrual bleeding pressure 80-90 % patient ( 26-32 ) . LUVO provide similar relief symptom ( 89.4 % symptomatic improvement 21.2 % complete resolution symptom ) 2001 7- 12-month follow-up 87 patient LUVO ( 33 ) . Since time rapid growth use treatment various modification , simultaneous accompaniment myomectomy either laparoscopy ML , considerable research outcome ( 22,34-42 ) . However , previous data , find combination LUVO myomectomy provide definite effectiveness symptom control woman symptomatic uterine myoma ( 98.1 % 100 % symptom resolution depend various kind item ) , minimize tumor recurrence , render vast majority re-interventions unnecessary ( 22 ) . Myomectomy perform laparoscopic approach ML patient undergo LUVO procedure . Before 2002 , often use ML perform myomectomy ( 22 ) . However , shorten incision le 4 cm , create ultramini-laparotomy ( UMLT ) perform myomectomy ( 10,11,43 ) . Since many conservative therapy might provide less therapeutic effect symptom control disease status , aim prospective study try evaluate therapeutic outcome symptomatic uterine myoma different kind therapy come 5 year Taipei Veterans General Hospital .</brief_summary>
