	<brief_summary>Background : - Incidence breast cancer low Mongolia ( 6.6/100,000 ) , especially rural area . Over past 15 year , considerable economic growth Mongolia , result migration urban center capital , Ulaanbaatar , area nomadic semi-nomadic lifestyle . This recent migration offer opportunity study endocrine profile premenopausal woman acculturate Western lifestyle . Objectives : - To obtain new data premenopausal endocrine growth factor concentration ass possible variation migration status within Ulaanbaatar ; , compare woman live Ulaanbaatar long period time recently move Ulaanbaatar . - To compare data Mongolia data United States ( possibly China ) , woman high risk breast cancer . Eligibility : - A sample 375 premenopausal woman draw large sample mother whose child participate study conduct Harvard Medical School . Only mother girl include cross-sectional study . Women age 25 44 year pregnant breastfeeding eligible . Design : - A total 30 ml ( three 10 ml sample ) whole blood collect . Women ask provide spot urine sample . These sample send periodically NCI biorespository course study test . A portion sample participant keep Ulaanbaatar case problem delivery United States . - The following hormone evaluate : testosterone , androstenedione , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , DHEA-sulfate , estrone , estradiol , estriol , progesterone , prolactin , placental lactogen , IGF-1 IGFBP-3 , VEGF , soluble endoglin , possibly angiogenic protein . - Socioeconomic status medical lifestyle information assess questionnaire , include ethnicity , occupation , education , migration status ( e.g. , whether move rural area time since migration ) . Breast cancer risk factor age first pregnancy , age first menstruation , gravidity ( total number pregnancy ) , parity ( total number childbirth ) , smoke status , alcohol use , dietary intake also determine . ( These questionnaire pilot test revised start study . ) The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire , develop World Health Organization , assess physical activity . - Mean median premenopausal hormone concentration previously collect blood sample woman United States high breast cancer risk compare Mongolian sample .

	<detailed_description>There strike difference breast cancer incidence rate Asian North American Western European population , within Asia variation also wide . Incidence Mongolia one low world ( 6.6/100,000 ) China , neighbor south , three time rate ( 18.7/100,000 ) . Furthermore , rate appear high urban rural area Mongolia . Over last decade half Mongolia experience profound economic change result mass migration nomadic semi-nomadic existence western lifestyle capital city Ulaanbaatar , back migration rural area . Together contrast exposure traditional urban setting , migration present opportunity study woman acculturate western lifestyle . We propose collect blood urine sample premenopausal Mongolian woman live UlaanBaatar , capital Mongolia , describe concentration several steroid hormone growth factor play role breast cancer development . The purpose study ass whether endocrine profile differs degree Western acculturation among recently migrate capital . Subjects recruit among mother girl participate study milk consumption hormonal status presently conduct colleague Harvard Medical School . In addition blood draw urine collection , participant height weight measure complete questionnaire reproductive medical history , migration status lifestyle factor . Premenopausal blood sample accompany information medical history lifestyle factor woman participate Project Viva Boston , Massachusetts provide comparison group US woman high breast cancer risk . In general , Asian country treat one entity substantial variation breast cancer incidence among country make large geographic area address . This variation among Asian country may provide opportunity hypothesis generate seek determine factor explain difference breast cancer rate population . Studies range biological parameter premenopausal woman among different racial/ethnic population vary breast cancer incidence would informative .</detailed_description>
