	<brief_summary>This study compare radiosurgery ( focused radiation , Gamma Knife Radiosurgery ) temporal lobectomy ( standard surgical care ) treatment temporal lobe epilepsy . Patients seizures begin temporal lobe control medication trial offer entry . Patients high likelihood seizure control open surgery treatment randomize standard surgery radiosurgery . A prior study show focused radiation ( radiosurgery ) may also reduce eliminate seizure arise temporal lobe . The main study hypothesis radiosurgery safe effective temporal lobectomy treat patient seizure arise medial temporal lobe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiosurgery Open Surgery Epilepsy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare effectiveness Gamma Knife radiosurgery temporal lobectomy treatment patient drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy . Aim 1 design compare seizure-free outcome morbidity radiosurgery patient drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy open temporal lobectomy . Our primary hypothesis radiosurgery non-inferior lobectomy respect seizure-free rate 25-36 month follow therapy ( one-year seizure freedom begin 2 year treatment ) . Aim 2 design compare neuropsychological outcome patient undergo radiosurgery temporal lobe surgery , particular respect verbal memory function language-dominant hemisphere treat patient . Our hypothesis patient treat speech-dominant temporal lobe seizures temporal lobectomy show great reduction verbal memory patient treat radiosurgery . Aim 3 design determine change occur quality life patient temporal lobe epilepsy follow radiosurgical treatment compare open surgery . Our primary hypothesis improvement ( compare baseline 3 year post-treatment ) quality life measure group . Our secondary hypothesis open surgery radiosurgery subject undergo transient reduction quality life measure cause treatment effect first year follow treatment , quality life improve subject become seizure-free , independent treatment group . Aim 4 design compare cost-effectiveness radiosurgery compare open surgery . Specifically , marginal cost-utility ratio fall $ 50,000/QALY , threshold think indicate outcome consider worth cost .</detailed_description>
