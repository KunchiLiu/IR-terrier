	<brief_summary>1 . Statement Problem According National Fire Protection Association ( NFPA ) , 43.7 % firefighter die job experience sudden cardiac death . The job also affords incredible amount stress . Cholesterol therapy well demonstrate reduce coronary plaque progression . However certainly factor evaluate progression coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , factor must play role . Garlic therapy show retard atherosclerosis independently . 2 . Hypothesis Specific Aims The hypothesis proposal : In comparison placebo group , Aged Garlic Extract ( AGE ) therapy + Coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ) effective slow progression coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) firefighter establish atherosclerosis , independent baseline blood pressure , statin use cardiovascular risk factor . Specific Aims : 1 . Compare effect cholesterol lower effect firefighter population patient influence Aged Garlic Extract + CoQ10 placebo . 2 . Compare whether degree change atherosclerotic coronary artery plaque burden change different rate influence Aged Garlic Extract + CoQ10 compare placebo treatment . 3 . Compare whether Aged Garlic Extract + CoQ10 therapy induces change baseline value include biological biochemical parameter , LDL cholesterol , homocysteine , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , endothelial function .</brief_summary>

The density measure Hounsfield unit , score 1 130-199 HU , 2 200-299 HU , 3 300-399 HU , 4 400 HU great . Secondary Change blood value endothelial function 6 12 month : 1 . Plasma lipid : total plasma cholesterol triglyceride , LDL-Cholesterol , HDL-Cholesterol , VLDL-Cholesterol determine precipitation method ; 2 . Endothelial marker inflammation : C-reactive protein Homocysteine , well GSH</detailed_description>
