	<brief_summary>Children born heart defect undergo surgery infant correct defect . However , many treatment use pediatric heart patient originally develop adult may best option child . This study analyze tissue sample newborns infant undergo surgery heart defect learn child 's heart develop first year life . This information may help identify possible treatment gear specifically pediatric heart patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining Developmental Changes Heart Contractions Children With Congenital Heart Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital heart defect abnormality problem structure heart present birth . Examples congenital heart defect include hypoplastic left heart syndrome , condition occur left side heart develop completely , tetralogy Fallot , condition involve four specific type structural defect within heart . Many advance make recent year field pediatric heart surgery , child bear congenital heart defect able undergo heart surgery infant repair defect . However , little known difference infant 's heart function adult 's heart function . Thus , therapy use treat child heart defect originally develop adult may best option infant young child . The purpose study gain good understanding heart change child 's first year life , newborn less 1 week old infant 3 12 month old . During surgical repair congenital heart defect , tissue ventricular structure heart sometimes remove part surgery . In study , researcher examine ventricular tissue remove surgical procedure newborns hypoplastic leave heart syndrome infant tetralogy Fallot . Study researcher compare newborn infant tissue sample term difference excitation-contraction coupling , also refer contraction response . Excitation-contraction couple heart process wherein electrical activity heart translate contraction heart muscle , result pump blood body . Study researcher also examine calcium , require heart contraction , flow heart cell determine whether process differs among newborns infant . Acquiring data excitation-contraction coupling role calcium important increase strength heart contraction key component treatment option child congenital heart defect . This study grant waiver consent de-identified tissue collect waste sample . The number participant represent number sample collect .</detailed_description>
