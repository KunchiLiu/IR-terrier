	<brief_summary>This study patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) yet receive treatment disease . Current therapy disease include use combination chemotherapy regimens contain Fludarabine Rituximab , find effective CLL . In study , subject receive Fludarabine Rituximab . After 3 cycle 6 cycle Fludarabine Rituximab treatment , receive Lenalidomide . We research attempt improve response , outcome , Fludarabine Rituximab previously untreated CLL patient . Lenalidomide drug alters immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Lenalidomide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) . MDS MM blood disorder involve different type blood cell . It approve chronic lymphocytic leukemia . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider experimental . This research do attempt find good treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia . We know effect Lenalidomide follow regimen Fludarabine Rituximab . The hypothesis study add Lenalidomide standard treatment regimen Fludarabine Rituximab well outcomes treatment Fludarabine Rituximab alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Following Fludarabine/Rituximab ( FR ) Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single institution Phase II study enrol patient untreated CLL receive fludarabine rituximab ( FR ) combination therapy . Subjects demonstrate Stable disease Progressive disease complete 3 cycle FR receive lenalidomide monotherapy maximum 6 cycle . Subjects achieve &gt; /= PR receive 3 cycle FR receive 3 additional cycle FR ( maximum 6 cycle ) . Upon completion FR treatment subject receive lenalidomide monotherapy maximum 6 cycle . Response assessment perform Module A ( FR ) : every cycle , would include imaging cycle 3 clinically indicate . Response assessment perform Module B ( Lenalidomide monotherapy ) : Before start Lenalidomide therapy , every cycle completion therapy . Imaging Module B would obtain start lenalidomide therapy , completion therapy . Bone marrow biopsy perform prior start therapy Module A ( FR ) , prior start Module B ( Lenalidomide ) , completion Module B . Bone marrow biopsy obtain Lenalidomide therapy discretion investigator . Minimum residual disease assessment bone marrow specimens include immunohistochemistry flow cytometry . Additional study bone marrow specimen send flow cytometric analysis ( standard four color flow ) , ZAP-70 immunohistochemical stain FISH analysis ( 13q deletion , trisomy 12 , 11q deletion , 17p ) perform time interval describe . Response assess accord Cheson Criteria . Blood specimens optional correlative study draw Day 0 prior FR , prior start lenalidomide , 90 day initiation lenalidomide , 7 day last dose lenalidomide .</detailed_description>
