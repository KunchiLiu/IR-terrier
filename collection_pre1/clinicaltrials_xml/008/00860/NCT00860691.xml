	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - determine neutrophil activity patient colon cancer , - determine level sFas , sFasL IL - 17 serum healthy volunteer colon cancer patient establish prognostic value , - elucidate relationship serum sFas , sFasL IL - 17 level clinicopathologic feature colon cancer , - compare influence laparoscopic conventional procedure postoperative serum sFas sFasL level colon cancer patient - compare influence laparoscopic conventional procedure postoperative serum IL - 17 level colon cancer patient - compare influence laparoscopic conventional procedure postoperative neutrophil function - confirm expression FasL protein human colorectal cancer elucidate relationship FasL expression clinicopathologic feature disease , establish prevalence Fas primary colon adenocarcinoma elucidate relationship FasL expression clinicopathologic feature disease - determine functional activity tumour infiltrating neutrophil</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer lead cause death worldwide . Tumour cell extravasation play key role tumour metastasis . There evidence tumour cell-leukocyte interaction may support tumour cell invasion could create optimal microenvironment tumour growth metastatic site . Neutrophils produce free radical protease ; could cause tumour cytolysis , well promote tumour growth metastasis . It seem neutrophils play important role context tumour angiogenesis . It well understood FasL induces immune privilege organ elicit inflammation . To explain apparently conflict phenomenon , important investigate mechanism FasL-induced inflammation detail . Fas/FasL serve potential target effective antitumor therapy . This research useful eludicate importance neutrophil colorectal cancer . We investigate possible role neutrophil activity FasL-induced neutrophil infiltration tumor growth colorectal cancer . sFas sFasL could way measure balance apoptotic immunoescape effect surgical resection colon cancer . If number neutrophil peripheral blood mirror situation tumor tissue , data could support investigation neutrophil-targeted therapy anti-cancer strategy . Inflammation-dependent angiogenesis seem central force tumor growth expansion , concept support observation use anti-inflammatory drug , lead angiogenesis inhibition . The mechanisms inflammatory angiogenesis could provide new approach target , cure , prevent tumor angiogenesis . Investigation physiologic regulation IL-17 may thus useful treatment clinical setting characterize persistent neovascularisation . Inhibition neutrophil elastase might reduce inflammatory response , could also prevent cancer cell progression . Anti-neutrophil elastase therapy tumour resection might important strategic approach manage postoperative complication prevent cancer recurrence . Patients allocate laparoscopic conventional open colorectal surgery eligibility confirm informed consent give . Randomization perform computer ; sequence base list variable block size single centre without stratification . The randomization list opaque envelope generate independent personnel otherwise involved trial . Information operation remain consecutively number sealed envelope store specific box clinical site . The envelope contain allocation add patient 's file shortly enter operate theatre . The envelope open surgeon perform assign procedure . Until day discharge participant , nurse medical staff blind type surgery perform patient colorectal cancer apply cover abdominal bandage . During trial , blood sample retrieve assessed cytologist molecular biologist blind study arm .</detailed_description>
