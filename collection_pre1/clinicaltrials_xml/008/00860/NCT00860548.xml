	<brief_summary>The Scleroderma Cyclophosphamide Or Transplant ( SCOT ) Trial Phase II/III interventional trial compare two treatment early , severe scleroderma . These two intervention high dose immunosuppressive therapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation monthly high dose pulse cyclophosphamide ( later 12 dos ) . While standard care might consider optimal control arm trial one , standard care available population scleroderma patient define eligibility criterion trial . The rheumatologist protocol team believe SCOT cyclophosphamide regimen represent best control arm study . However , give concern use treatment arm control establish standard care , registry establish . The registry prospective , observational study subject severe systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) eligible participate Scleroderma Cyclophosphamide Transplantation ( SCOT ) Study deny insurance coverage decline participate prior randomization . Subjects accrued period SCOT study . Subjects follow course treatment prescribe treat physician interference registry . The primary purpose study document disease course outcome group participant eligible SCOT study , decline participate , order determine whether outcome well , bad , different participate treatment phase trial .</brief_summary>
