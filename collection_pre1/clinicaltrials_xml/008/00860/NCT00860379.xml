	<brief_title>The Effect Selenium Supplementation Among Pediatric Patients With Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Title : The effect selenium supplementation among pediatric patient burn Primary Investigator : Maggie L. Dylewski , PhD , RD Co-investigators : RL . Sheridan , MD ; C Ryan , MD ; K Prelack , PhD , RD ; M Lydon , RN ; J Weber , RN , BSN , CIC Approved : FDA ( IND # 78963 ) , Partners IRB ( # 2007-P-001176 ) . Funding : private grant Boston Burn Foundation Background Information : Selenium , essential dietary nutrient , component glutathione peroxidase ( antioxidant ) thioredoxin reductase , enzyme regulates cytokine expression thus play role immune system . Previous study among adult burn patient show IV selenium supplementation relate decreased infection mortality . Please refer study protocol detail . Previous Research : We previously show child burn ( n = 20 ) &gt; 20 % TBSA low plasma selenium value compare reference data healthy American child . Results study also find significant relationship plasma selenium incidence infection . Study Design : Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial Specific Aims : 1. determine impact supplemental selenium plasma selenium , glutathione peroxidase activity , urine selenium among pediatric patient burn &gt; 20 % TBSA . 2. determine association selenium supplementation , biomarkers Se status indicator stress infection . Subjects : N = 75 pediatric patient burn . Inclusion criterion : - Between 1 18 year age admit Shriners Burns Hospital - TBSA burn &gt; 20 % - Existing IV catheter - Enrolled study within 3 week burn injury Treatment : All subject randomize 1 3 group receive treatment 8 week , 95 % wound closure , central venous catheter access discontinue . 1 . Placebo ( IV 0.9 % sodium chloride ) 2 . 2 mcg/kg/day IV Selenium 3 . 4 mcg/kg/day IV Selenium Biological sample collection : - 4 mL 8 mL ( 8 every week ) plasma week - 24-hour urine collection week Sample analyse : - Samples freeze analysis - Samples send outside lab analysis . - Plasma also send Massachusetts General Hospital every week plasma selenium analysis ( assess toxicity ) Primary outcome measure : - Plasma selenium - Plasma glutathione peroxidase - Urine selenium Secondary outcome measure : â€¢ occurrence pneumonia infection ( bacterial fungal ) wound , blood , urine Risks : - Supplement dos determine use data previous study , current RDAs upper tolerable limit , ASPEN guideline parenteral selenium , dietary data record previous study . According reference weight ( NHANES III ) supplement dos exceed upper tolerable limit child . - Selenium toxicity rare . However plasma assess every week selenium level . Monitoring Quality Assurance : - All subject monitor treatment-related adverse event 2 week follow discontinuation study therapy - Any adverse event report Partners Human Research Committee FDA per guideline . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board , consist 4 knowledgeable staff member , meet 2 time per year monitor data safety .</detailed_description>
