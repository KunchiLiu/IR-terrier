	<brief_title>Iodine I 131 Monoclonal Antibody BC8 Before Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximally tolerate dose 131I-BC8 ( anti-cluster differentiation [ CD ] 45 ) ( iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8 ) deliver prior autologous stem cell transplantation patient relapsed/refractory B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , T-NHL , Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To optimize protein dose ( antibody [ Ab ] ) deliver favorable biodistribution majority patient . II . To assess radiation dose deliver tumor sit normal organ therapy . III . To evaluate dose-response relationship radiation-dose tumor clinical response . IV . To estimate overall progression-free survival regimen patient . V. To evaluate toxicity tolerability therapy . VI . To evaluate feasibility deliver high-dose 131I-BC8 autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) B-Cell NHL , T-NHL , HL patient . VII . To evaluate ability reduce infusion reaction via unlabeled BC8 preinfusion . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive dosimetric dose iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8 intravenously ( IV ) day -20 therapeutic dose day -11 . Before day -20 , patient may also receive 2 additional dosimetric dose iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8 IV approximately 1-2 week apart . Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplantation day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
