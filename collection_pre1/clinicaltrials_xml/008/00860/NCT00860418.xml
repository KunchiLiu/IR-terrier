	<brief_summary>Young inner-city child asthma high emergency department ( ED ) visit rate . Relying emergency department asthma care dangerous sign poorly control asthma . This research focus whether specialized asthma nurse join family child 's doctor visit ED visit asthma make sure child parent keep follow-up appointment nurse remind child 's doctor prescribe preventive asthma medicine asthma action plan home ( PAAL intervention ) result young child asthma few day wheeze cough . The investigator hypothesize : 1 . Significantly child receive PAAL intervention attend great 2 non-urgent visit great 6 refill child 's anti-inflammatory medication 12 month compare child control standard asthma education group . 2 . Children PAAL intervention group experience less morbidity caregiver experience increase quality life compare child control standard asthma education group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma number one cause pediatric emergency department ( ED ) visit young child result significant economic impact society use health resource . Reliance ED asthma care costly also dangerous index poorly control asthma . Recent update national asthma guideline recommend daily inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) cornerstone treatment patient persistent asthma . When properly use ICS prevent exacerbation , ED visit hospitalization maintain asthma control . However , &gt; 50 % inner city minority child asthma receive use recommend anti-inflammatory preventive medication . In fact , many child encounter repeat ED visit provision appropriate preventive medication component guideline-based preventive care inconsistent follow-up primary care provider ( PCP ) . The overall goal study evaluate whether standardized caregiver physician prompt intervention , Pediatric Asthma Alert Leader ( PAAL ) , improve guideline-based preventive asthma care include increase anti-inflammatory use preventive PCP visit child frequent ED visit . This study build experience parent-child-PCP communication intervention ( `` Improving Asthma Communication Minority Families '' , ACE ) find teach parent child asthma communication skill result increased anti-inflammatory medication use 6 month child persistent asthma . However , beneficial effect intervention see primarily caregiver child remind nurse interventionist relay specific health information PCP . Furthermore , intervention associate decreased ED visit appropriate PCP follow-up sustain preventive care . The propose PAAL intervention potential substantially improve care child high risk asthma morbidity propose establish ( 1 ) whether positive effect ACE study replicate specific group high-risk child repeat ED visit ; 2 ) whether effect intervention enhance incorporating consistent clinician prompting assure provision component guideline-based asthma care ( ICS use , asthma action plan , sustain regular follow-up care monitor asthma control ) ; 3 ) whether family achieve optimal care respond intensive tiered intervention . We propose caregiver clinician prompting/feedback intervention use pediatric asthma alert leader ( PAAL ) nurse 1 ) organize relay critical , individualized child health information ED home set PCP feedback letter , 2 ) ensure child caregiver attendance follow-up visit PCP 3 ) empower family prompt PCP guideline-based treatment decision PCP visit . We hypothesize PAAL intervention improve preventive care reduce morbidity health care cost high-risk child asthma compare Standard Asthma Education ( SAE ) control group .</detailed_description>
