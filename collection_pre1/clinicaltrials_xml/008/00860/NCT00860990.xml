	<brief_summary>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) often result reduce bowel function regularity , lead decrease quality life affect . Evidence-based research indicate , survey , individual SCI express great reduction quality life derive bowel routine able-bodied subject . In addition , extent reduction quality life direct relationship level Injury . Those tetraplegia score worse paraplegia paraplegic score bad control . The development adequate quality life questionnaire need effectively identify impact bowel care quality life patient SCI compare able-bodied control . The purpose study determine discriminatory ability survey various diagnosis SCI , CVA , TBI , chronic back pain , radiculopathy Rehabilitation Service able bodied person .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In abstract `` A Bowel Care Survey Assess Quality Life Persons With Spinal Cord Injury '' Journal Spinal Cord Medicine 2006 , JP Lirio , et al survey 20 subject ( 10 control , 5 para , 5 tetra ) . The survey consist 42 item relate GI function , bowel program/routine quality life . Survey item weight across range outcome ( e.g. , complete continence=0 frequent incontinence solid evacuate=5 ) . Total survey score compare among group ANOVA Scheffe post hoc test . In SCI , level injury ( LOI ) convert numeric value relationship LOI total score determine simple regression . The range score across group 2 111 point . The control score significantly low Para group significantly low Tetra group ( 6 5 vs. 46 38 vs. 92 24 , P &lt; 0.01 , respectively ) . Within SCI , 43 % variance total score explain level injury . ( r2=42.5 , P &lt; 0.05 ) , suggestive potential good content validity tool . The author conclude preliminary result survey show person great degree neurological impairment also manifest great negative impact bowel care QoL . These result encourage able develop sensitive tool capture change bowel care status therapeutic intervention would expect influence QoL . Innovative potentially efficacious treatment bowel care develop . There clinical/investigative need valid survey sensitive quality life ( QoL ) change relate intervention bowel care spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . This ongoing project develop self-reported gastrointestinal ( GI ) survey measure impact bowel function QoL individual SCI . This research seek develop quality life questionnaire use assess bowel function able bodied individual well spinal cord patient . This tool essential measuring change bowel function due intervention age , rehabilitation , medication , etc .</detailed_description>
