	<brief_title>Alimta Plus Gemcitabine Advanced Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soft tissue sarcomas represent 0.7 % malignancy diagnose United States . The peak incidence occur child young adult second peak occur middle age , result significant morbidity mortality young , productive individual . Although limbpreserving surgery radiation therapy improve primary treatment tumor , therapy advance , metastatic tumor unsatisfactory . The purpose phase II study evaluate efficacy treatment Alimta gemcitabine give day 1 14 day cycle patient unresectable metastatic soft tissue sarcoma . Gemcitabine establish salvage therapy soft tissue sarcoma combination docetaxel . Alimta multitargeted antifolate drug inhibits several folate dependent enzyme require cell proliferation . Alimta show efficacy several solid tumor type single agent combination agent . The combination Alimta gemcitabine synergistic likely efficacy soft tissue sarcoma . The primary objective study determine response rate among patient unresectable soft tissue sarcoma treat combination . Secondary endpoint evaluate median survival patient population , well time objective tumor response , time treatment failure overall survival . The toxicity regimen population also analyze . Given desperate need new agent treat patient , phase II trial combination therapy pursue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven soft tissue sarcoma ( except follow histology : gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) , Kaposi 's Sarcoma , mesothelioma ) . Age â‰¥ 18 year Recurrent progressive disease define increase size exist tumor mass , development new tumor mass mass , amenable definitive surgical therapy . Patients may another cancer must convince clinical evidence sarcoma disease require therapeutic intervention . ( i.e . Several sarcoma patient prior cancer [ Hodgkin 's disease breast cancer ] treat year previously develop clinically active sarcoma . ) Patients may receive prior chemotherapy , may fail 02 prior cytotoxic regimen . Measurable disease define lesion measure least one dimension physical examination mean medical image technique . Ascites pleural effusion consider measurable disease . Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % . At least 3 week since prior chemotherapy least 6 week since prior radiation therapy . Soft tissue sarcoma follow histology : gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) , Kaposi 's sarcoma , mesothelioma .
