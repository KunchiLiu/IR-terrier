	<brief_summary>This Phase II , open label , fix dose , repeat injection , single institution study . Eligible subject receive six dos Ad-ISF35 inject directly select lymph node ultrasound guidance . The primary goal determine monitor clinical biological response patient treat repeat intranodal injection Ad-ISF35 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Repeat Intranodal Injection Memgen 's Cancer Vaccine , Ad-ISF35 , Subjects With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( CLL/SLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II clinical trial study subject treat multiple dos Ad-ISF35 give via intranodal injection use fix dose 3.3 x 10^10 ISF35 viral particle . Intranodal injection administer every 2-4 week six total injection . Because first time repeat administration Ad-ISF35 perform via intranodal injection , order allow sufficient time evaluate safety toxicity procedure , treat subject 1 thru 3 one month interval inpatient admission 24 hour observation . After subject three receives second ISF35 injection proceed enrollment cohort four patient per month one week interval study enrollment complete . These subject treat outpatient observe 3 hour prior discharge . ISF35 already use Phase I clinical trial . The trial demonstrate ISF35 treatment well-tolerated patient experience significant unexpected adverse event . Patients report flu-like symptom ISF35 , disappear within one three day . ISF35 abbreviation Immune Stimulatory Factor 35 , offspring technology discover Dr. Thomas J. Kipps , MD , PhD , Professor , Department Medicine Deputy Director Research , UCSD Moores Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
