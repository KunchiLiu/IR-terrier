	<brief_summary>Previous gestational diabetes ( GDM ) predispose affected woman diabetes . Pregnancy , essence , serve metabolic stress test uncovers underlie insulin resistance ß-cell dysfunction . Cumulative incidence rate type 2 diabetes ( DM2 ) among woman history GDM vary widely depend length follow underlie risk diabetes population . Like DM2 , incidence postpartum diabetes appear increase The cumulative incidence DM2 vary 2.6 &gt; 70 % study postpartum follow-up range 6 week 28 year . Among woman history gestational diabetes , generally accept race , age , parity , family history diabetes , pre-pregnancy weight , postpartum obesity , weight gain risk factor develop DM2 . Other suspected risk factor include smoking , physical inactivity , diet , drug adversely affect glucose metabolism . Despite high increase rate DM2 Louisiana , medical community reliable estimate number woman live southern Louisiana develop diabetes subsequent GDM . At Woman 's Hospital , investigator 8246 delivery 2007 ; 7873 mother ( 95 % delivery ) either African American Caucasian . Of group woman , 665 diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus . Thus , around 8.5 % African American Caucasian woman deliver baby Woman 's Hospital 2007 glucose abnormality . The incidence diabetes impaired glucose metabolism immediate postpartum period within 12 month delivery population unknown . There long-term study perform Louisiana compare benefit different screen strategy evaluate optimum testing frequency GDM reduce rate DM2 cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) high-risk woman . The investigator plan use study outreach effort provide screen previous gestational diabetic mother without adequate medical coverage follow delivery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comprehensive Postpartum Screening Strategies Women With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ( GDM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women previous gestational diabetes constitute ideal group development , test , implementation clinical strategy primary diabetes prevention . One-third one-half woman history GDM develop type 2 ( DM2 ) within 3-5 year 70 % develop DM2 follow &gt; 10 year . Studies show measure fast glucose level postpartum sufficiently sensitive identify woman impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) DM2 . Data present Fifth International Workshop-Conference GDM indicate , postpartum , 34 % woman IGT DM2 impair fast glucose 44 % DM2 fasting level 100 mg/dl ( &lt; 5.5 mmol/l ) . The recommended process detect permanent diabetes woman GDM might become pregnant 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) 6-12 week post partum every year thereafter . Postpartum management woman GDM critical markedly increase risk DM2 comorbidities future Follow-up study woman GDM necessary establish efficient most-effective approach postpartum screen type 2 diabetes . This study examine diagnostic effectiveness OGTT-derived glucose tolerance , insulin secretion insulin sensitivity index compare index derive fast value glucose insulin subject GDM perform post-partum . We establish whether post-partum fast and/or glucose-stimulated index insulin sensitivity secretion accurately estimate degree insulin resistance relative ß-cell function race/ethnicity group woman delivery pregnancy complicate gestational diabetes predict risk development diabetes CVD . .Primary Objective1 ) We identify , recruit test 100 individual prior GDM order : § Determine best way ass glucose tolerance disorder ' prevalence pregnancy complicate GDM southern Louisiana.§ Determine effective screening strategy identify woman prior GDM develop high risk develop DM2 comorbidities postpartum.A 2 hr , 75-gram OGTT measurement insulin glucose perform 6-12 week 1-year post-delivery check-up ; compare result single fast glucose insulin value.Secondary Objectives1 ) We measure cardiometabolic marker ( lipid , blood pressure ) COPS-GDM study order : § Identify frequency value CVD risk marker woman glucose abnormality persist pregnancy GDMGlucometabolic perturbation carry particularly high risk metabolic syndrome woman prior GDM . Woman prior GDM show high blood pressure alter lipid profile increase LDL cholesterol triglyceride level decrease HDL cholesterol level correlate cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors2 ) We measure anthropometric measure ( body weight , BMI , abdominal girth ) liver aminotransferase level ( ALT , AST ) order : § Determine high prevalence postpartum glucose abnormality woman prior GDM predict BMI category and/or abdominal adiposity § Determine elevate abnormal aminotransferase activity prominent prior GDM woman relationship subsequent diabetes Former gestational diabetic mother compare woman history GDM find high body mass index ( BMI ) visceral adiposity . The distribution postpartum glucose abnormality BMI category find common increased BMI.3 ) We investigate impact breastfeeding woman prior GDM glucose tolerance CVD risk factor : § Determine lactation immediate long-term favorable effect patient population postpartum.Breast-feeding associate significantly low triglyceride level , high HDL cholesterol , low total cholesterol/HDL ratio , low mean fast glucose , low prevalence postpartum abnormality glucose tolerance , include diabetes . Breastfeeding also report low rate overt diabetes develop later life woman history gestational diabetes .</detailed_description>
