	<brief_summary>Patients locally advance metastatic gastric carcinoma carcinoma esophagogastric junction without prior palliative therapy treat 8 cycle FLOT scheme ( 12 cycle response favourable ) . Prior enrollment unique detail clinical evaluation dissemination disease do include differentiate regard metastatic status . patient classify either ( A ) locally advance , ( B ) limit metastatic , ( C ) extensive metastatic disease . In arm A B surgical intervention plan operability reach . The hypothesis classify patient individually state disease , patient arm B significantly prolong overall survival compare patient arm C .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study With FLOT Patients With Locally Advanced , Limited Metastatic Extensive Metastatic Adenocarcinoma Stomach Esophagogastric Junction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>250 patient locally advance metastatic gastric carcinoma carcinoma esophagogastric junction without prior palliative therapy treat 8 cycle FLOT scheme ( 12 cycle response favourable ) . Prior enrolment unique detail clinical evaluation dissemination disease do include differentiate regard M-category TNM classification . A prospective stratification classify patient either ( A ) locally advance , ( B ) limit metastatic , ( C ) extensive metastatic disease . In addition , pharmacogenetic risk profile patient evaluate combined analysis two genetic polymorphism metabolism apply substance ( XPD312 , GSTT1 ) . For assessment disease , reference region examine CT MRI scan applicable endoscopy prior start study , every 2 month end therapy progression disease occur . Evaluation quality life ( standard form like EORTC-Q30 others ) continue progression . Clinical examination ( blood count , assessment toxicity , anamnesis ) perform every two week evaluation toxicity application chemotherapy . After informed consent give , peripheral blood patient analyse pharmacogenetic risk profile . Representative tumor material analyse immunohistochemistry quantitative PCR expression several molecular factor .</detailed_description>
