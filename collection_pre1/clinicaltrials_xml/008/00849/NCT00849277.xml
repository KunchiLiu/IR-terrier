	<brief_title>Study Effect Probiotics Respiratory Morbidity After Influenza Vaccination Elderly Nursing Homes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza virus member orthomyxovirus family cause acute viral disease respiratory tract . The illness usually self-limiting . Hospitalization death mainly occur high-risk group ( elderly , chronically ill ) . Response vaccination subject high level variability due age , stress , nutritional stage , etc . Lactic acid bacteria naturally commensal bacteria small large intestine . These bacteria protect host potential pathogen competitive exclusion also production antibacterial agent know bacteriocins . It recently show another mechanism whereby probiotic bacteria may provide health benefit modulate immune response . Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota ( LcS ) widely consume ferment milk product . Several study , animal well human , report immunomodulatory function LcS . The aim multicentre , randomize , placebo control , double blind study ( RCT ) ass probiotic treatment Lactobacillus casei Shirota improve protection influenza ( -like ) infection vaccination trivalent influenza vaccine elderly reside nursing home . Trial endpoint : 1 . Clinical outcome : difference incidence upper respiratory tract infection ( influenza-like illness ) 2 . Serological outcome : difference influenza vaccine specific serum IgG probiotic control treatment</detailed_description>
