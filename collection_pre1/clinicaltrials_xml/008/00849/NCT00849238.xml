	<brief_summary>The rationale study determine Campath-1H use liver transplant recipient induce state immunological unresponsiveness would eliminate need calcineurin inhibitor maintenance therapy , also reduce corticosteroid utilization , decrease incidence acute cellular rejection perhaps reduce severity histologic recurrence certain autoimmune disease responsible cause liver failure . The investigator propose randomize prospective open label trial 50 liver transplant recipient receive calcineurin inhibitor free immunosuppressive protocol consist single dose Campath-1H induction therapy association maintenance mycophenolate mofetil ( CellCept® ) low dose steroid . The second group receive standard immunosuppressive regimen , consist IV steroid induction therapy maintenance steroid , together tacrolimus full therapeutic dose induction antibody therapy .</brief_summary>
