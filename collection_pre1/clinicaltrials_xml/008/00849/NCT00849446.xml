	<brief_summary>Background : Accelerometry recently introduce clinical stroke research . However , whether accelerometry valid reliable tool stroke need establish . From literature becomes clear exist accelerometer show shortages patient stroke specific deficit patient . Purpose : The aim study investigate validity test-retest reliability SenseWear Pro armband objective measurement physical activity chronic stroke patient . Patients Methods Subjects : Fifteen patient fifteen healthy subject include study follow write informed consent . The following demographic clinical data record : age , gender , height , length , medication use , self-reported handedness , Edinburgh Handedness Inventory , Rivermead Gross Function , Functional Ambulation Categories , medical surgical history . Methods : During one test session subject carry amount activity accord standardise protocol exist lying , sit , stand , walk , step exercise cycling . These activity present activity daily live . Measures : Subjects wear arm SenseWear Pro Armband . De data measuring device compare data retrieve 2 Yamax pedometer ergospirometry device . The outcome measure : count , heartbeat , oxygen use , energy expenditure , METabolic equivalent , time lying .</brief_summary>
