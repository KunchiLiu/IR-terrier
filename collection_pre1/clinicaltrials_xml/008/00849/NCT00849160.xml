	<brief_summary>Darunavir boost ritonavir ( darunavir/r ) powerful protease inhibitor , able reduce viral load patient infect multi-resistant HIV strain ; In vitro vivo study show induction resistance mutation protease gene much difficult association darunavir/r compare ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor ( PI/r ) , testify significantly higher genetic barrier resistance . Moreover , tolerance darunavir good , pharmacologic profile molecule allow daily administration 800/100 mg dose patient infected wild HIV strain slightly resistant darunavir/r strain . Thus , propose evaluate efficacy darunavir/r association daily substitute protease inhibitor regimen administer twice daily patient undetectable viral load receive tritherapy include protease inhibitor administer twice daily .</brief_summary>
