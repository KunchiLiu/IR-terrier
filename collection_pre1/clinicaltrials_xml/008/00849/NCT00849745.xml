	<detailed_description>Our targeted illness : - Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) : SLE involve virtually organ system , commonly involve various combination arthritis , dermatitis , glomerulonephritis , central nervous system manifestation hematologic complication . Although overall five ten-year survival rate SLE 86 % 80 % , respectively , rate reduce 60 % 50 % , respectively , patient poor prognosis SLE ( proliferative glomerulonephritis chronic change , elevate serum creatinine , nephrotic syndrome , anemia , low serum C3 , inadequate response treatment ) . - Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) : SSc condition divide two form ( diffuse limit ) characterize excessive often relentless fibrosis skin internal organ . Visceral involvement manifest esophageal hypomotility , interstitial lung disease , pulmonary hypertension renal failure . There satisfactory treatment systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) , diffuse form 5-year mortality 40 % , similar many malignancy . In clinical trial , alpha-interferon demonstrate clinically significant effect low dose methotrexate show conflicting result .</detailed_description>
