	<detailed_description>GSK1482160 new drug develop treat inflammatory pain ( example , arthritis ) . It act structure inflammatory cell , know P2X7 receptor . Blocking receptor reduce release important inflammatory chemical exist within body think play important role promote inflammatory pain . This study start low dose study drug , gradually increase subsequent dos . This know dose-rising way ass safety tolerability ( side effect make take drug unpleasant ) . Effects compare see placebo ( `` dummy '' drug ) take . Up 4 group 8 healthy male female volunteer enrol study . In addition , part study use check difference blood level study drug take without high fat meal .</detailed_description>
