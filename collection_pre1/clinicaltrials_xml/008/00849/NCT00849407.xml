	<brief_summary>Though generally accept exposure sunlight major causative factor skin cancer , risk develop melanoma directly link sun exposure non-melanoma skin cancer . Therefore , dual pathway propose , distinguish melanoma develop skin chronically expose sunlight occur skin normally protect . The risk type melanoma believe determined part genetic factor . To define marker reproducibly , investigator plan establish large cohort comprehensive information regard sun sensitivity ( skin type ) , history experience sun exposure , skin pigmentation phenotype , total number nevus , type skin tumor central European population . The investigator obtain blood participant DNA well serum analysis . Based find genetic variant melanocortin-1 receptor ( MC1R ) gene , associate red hair fair skin , show associate increase risk melanoma , particularly harbor BRAF mutation , investigator focus study recently discover genetic variant associate pigmentation . Furthermore , investigator study relation variant oncogenic mutation melanoma BRAF , RAS c-Kit . The study genetic variant follow , sufficiently large cohort establish reveal independent genetic risk factor multivariate analysis include potential covariates mention . The identification genetic risk factor melanoma help identify individual increase risk also improve understand molecular background development melanoma .</brief_summary>
