These condition , especially routine one shift follow another , may contribute accumulated workload , associate sleep deprivation . Such condition may considerable impact cognitive function response time concentration , fundamental medical personal 's function . The drive simulator base software ( STIS Drive Simulation software , System Technology INC , Hawthorne CA ) hardware consist computer , screen , two console , one include stir wheel press button , second include acceleration break paddle . Each test drive several stage , follow measure - ability maintain constant speed , ability maintain drive lain , follow another vehicle break abruptly . Additionally , test drive , several arrow appear screen , subject request push curtain button appear accord direction . This simulator use several prior report drive skill evaluation .
