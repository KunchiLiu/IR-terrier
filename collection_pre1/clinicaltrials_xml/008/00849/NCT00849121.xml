	<brief_summary>The investigator try find new method treat prostate cancer . The approach try enhance patient ' immune response cancer . In study , investigator test safety vaccine may able help body fight prostate cancer . The vaccine , call pTVG-HP , piece DNA genetic material contains genetic code protein make prostate gland , call prostatic acid phosphatase ( PAP ) . The vaccine give together substance call adjuvant . Adjuvants typically give vaccine improve effect vaccine . The adjuvant use study call granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . The main purpose study find whether vaccine generate long-lived immune response , whether good schedule vaccination find frequent laboratory test immune response . The investigator also want see vaccine stimulate immune reaction cancer cell .</brief_summary>
