	<brief_summary>The aim study calibrate ( adjust tune ) CAS FORE-SIGHT Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) monitor use measure tissue oxygen saturation internal organ ( StO2 ) . This measure amount oxygen carry blood within internal organ . In addition study assess degree similarity StO2 mean mixed venous oxygen saturation - measure amount oxygen carry blood return heart .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NIRS cerebral oximeter FDA-approved device use measure oxygen saturation within brain , similar manner pulse oximeter measure oxygen saturation finger tip . The sensor pad place surface forehead shine near-infrared light skull brain tissue brain tissue oxygen saturation estimate . The principle apply sensor pad place internal organ abdomen , example , liver . Currently way accurately measure oxygen saturation internal organ invasive placement intravenous line blood vessel organ . This study determine NIRS sensor reliably estimate tissue oxygen saturation non-invasively place pad skin abdomen . The study conduct pediatric patient undergoing cardiac catheterization , procedure invasive line place order get information heart . The procedure always conduct general anesthesia . During cardiac catheterization procedure blood sample routinely take oxygen saturation analysis . In study two oximeter sensor pad place forehead ( one side ) two oximeter sensor pad place abdominal wall . The oxygen saturation value oximeter sensor record continuously throughout cardiac catheterization procedure compare oxygen saturation value blood sample . In addition routine blood sample take part cardiac catheterization , one blood sample take invasive line within right hepatic ( liver ) vein . The information study determine well oximeter sensor estimate oxygen saturation internal organ ( StO2 ) blood return heart ( mean mixed venous oxygen saturation ) .</detailed_description>
