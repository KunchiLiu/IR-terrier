	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow cancer . Giving pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride together bortezomib , cyclophosphamide , dexamethasone may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect give pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride together bortezomib , cyclophosphamide , dexamethasone see well work treat patient multiple myeloma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Hydrochloride , Bortezomib , Cyclophosphamide , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy novel combination newly diagnose patient multiple myeloma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity novel combination regimen previously treat patient newly diagnose patient multiple myeloma . OUTLINE : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) orally ( PO ) 1 hour , bortezomib IV 3 minute , dexamethasone IV PO day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients also receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 1 hour day 8 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
