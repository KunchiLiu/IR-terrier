	<brief_summary>After major surgery , abdominal thoracic surgery , majority patient experience moderate severe pain may optimally control . Inadequate pain relief may lead complication hind rehabilitation slow recovery . Morphine ( MO ) commonly use opioid treatment post-surgical pain ( 14 ) . The preferred method administration nowadays intravenous patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) . In contrast , Continuous infusion intravenous morphine ( CIVM ) seldom use Post-Anesthesia Care Units ( PACUs ) acute postoperative pain , due concern cardio-respiratory deterioration , even though different study find technique administration effective safe ( term opioid-related symptoms.As part effort improve postoperative pain management Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center 's PACU , wish determine combine CIVM IV PCA superior IV PCA treatment postoperative pain follow major abdominal thoracic surgery.Our hypothesis continuous infusion , even give relatively low dose , would enable build-up pharmacologically effective MO blood level , thus provide overall well control pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study objective To compare efficacy two MO administration-protocols : PCA MO ( ) v combination continuous background infusion plus PCA MO ( combine dosage ) patient abdominal thoracic surgery . Methods Inclusion criteria The study conduct prospective , randomize , double blind one , enroll patient age 18-80 year undergo major abdominal procedure ( e.g . laparotomy , nephrectomy , gastrectomy , gastric bypass , pancreatectomy , splenectomy , abdominal aortic aneurysm ) thoracic surgery ( segmentectomy , lobectomy pneumonectomy ) institution year 2008-9 . Exclusion criterion We exclude study patient history drug alcohol abuse , psychiatric disturbance , senile dementia , Alzheimer 's disease , seizures suicide risk , use psychotropic drug , pregnancy nursing , hypersensitivity MO , non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) excipients , chronic acute pain origin , respiratory failure insufficiency , uncompensated congestive heart hepatic failure schedule emergency palliative procedure . We also exclude patient use antidepressant , anticonvulsant muscle relaxant , patient use monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 2 week surgery . Post enrollment dropouts Patients drop study one follow reason : need immediate postoperative artificial ventilation last 4 h , lack coherence ( &lt; 5/10 ) constant sedation ( &gt; 5/10 VAS ) , combative behavior PACU , postoperative requirement re-intervention and/or transfer intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Other suitable patient recruit replace one drop . Intra-study non-replaced dropout include protocol violation , patient 's decision withdraw ineffective drug protocol ( pain &gt; 5/10 VAS despite full evidence protocol implementation ) . Intra-operative management Anesthetics surgical management perform similarly patient . All patient receive prophylactic antibiotic . All premedicated oral 10 mg diazepam night surgery 40-75 min preoperatively . After sedative dose IV midazolam ( 1.5-2 mg ) fentanyl ( 1.5 μg/kg ) , propofol ( 1-2 mg/kg ) slowly inject IV patient loss consciousness . A non-depolarizing muscle relaxant enable endotracheal intubation . General anesthesia maintain accord institutional protocol , use nitrous oxide/oxygen 2/1 L/min enrich isoflurane , aim deliver 1 MAC anesthesia . A non-depolarizing muscle relaxant fentanyl continually infuse give repeated portion maintain muscle relaxation analgesia , hemodynamic ventilatory stability . Cardiovascular respiratory parameter monitor standard manner , intraoperative fluid administration blood replacement follow common cardiovascular , renal laboratory index . Towards end surgery , drug turn minimal dos atropine neostigmine administer reverse muscle relaxation obtain return normal spontaneous respiration . All patient transfer PACU observation . Study design Consented postoperative patient randomly assign one two group ( use closed-envelope technique ) : Group 1 receive PCA bolus injection MO , practice institution , whereas group 2 receive basal ( infusion ) administration PCA bolus injection . Dosage basal infusion PCA combination base preliminary dose-response pain control study data obtain previous study , technique provide satisfactory reduction even elimination pain along tolerable level side effect . For reason safety efficacy , maintain dos basal ( infusion ) demand ( bolus ) portion body weight basis . Study phase drug use Upon arrival PACU , patient connect oxygen face-mask vital sign monitor . Upon first complaint moderate severe rest pain ( ≥5/10 visual analog scale [ VAS ] ) , PACU drug-blinded attend physician establish patient coherent cooperative , PCA system connect patient 's IV line . The physician start device , deliver first bolus . The subsequent drug boluses self-administered patient . Group 1 patient receive MO infusion ( 10 μg/kg/h ) + MO bolus ( 10 μg/kg/bolus , request ) , whereas group 2 administer bolus 1.5 mg/bolus MO . A 7 min lockout time bolus prevent excessive dispense drug . If need , physician could administer two extra bolus optimal pain control within first 15 min postoperatively . Rescue diclofenac 75 mg IM allow help prompt start analgesia instead opioid titration , 6h later . No hourly dose limit set protocol . All patient treat accord designate study protocol long need ; use 12 h prompt patient standard pain care surgical department . Patient assessment Outcome measurement assess document every 15 min first 2 h study hourly , POD3 . Primary outcome include demand/delivery ratio MO rescue drug ( assess hourly activation IV-PCA device , 12 h total drug consumption ) . Secondary outcome : pain intensity ( evaluated patient ' self-rated pain , via VAS blind assessor ) , self-rated level sedation satisfaction , time dependence device urinary catheter , time discharge , time patient sits , stand leave bed . Adverse effect evaluate : respiratory depression ( respiratory rate , room air saturation , time extubation re-intubated patient ) ; vomiting/nausea ; allergic event , severe complication ( e.g . morbidity ) . The demographic data ( age , gender , weight ) , background characteristic ( pre-study heart respiratory rate , SpO2 , systolic diastolic blood pressure ) , patient ' American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical class , duration surgery intraoperative fentanyl usage also record ; analyze end study . Study hypothesis benefit The present study aim assess whether addition MO infusion commonly use PCA , although total dose inferior currently use institution , provide good pain control compare commonly use technique . We believe occurs , safer patient possibly allow early recovery , rehabilitation home discharge .</detailed_description>
