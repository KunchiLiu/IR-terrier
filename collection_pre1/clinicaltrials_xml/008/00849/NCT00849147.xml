	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Transplant From Partially Matched Donors Nonmyeloablative Conditioning Blood Cancers ( BMT CTN 0603 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leukemia lymphoma type blood cancer . Chemotherapy common treatment option people type cancer , cancer respond well chemotherapy , cancer return , bone marrow transplant another treatment option . In bone marrow transplant procedure , healthy bone marrow take donor transplanted patient . Bone marrow donate family member unrelated donor similar type bone marrow . Most bone marrow transplant perform use donor perfect close-to-perfect tissue match . However , participant study , researcher determine completely match donor unavailable within participant ' family , unrelated donor match find either . Participants , however , family member partial tissue match . Typically , people undergo bone marrow transplant receive high dos chemotherapy transplant prepare body accept donor bone marrow . In study , participant undergo new type bone marrow transplant call nonmyeloablative transplant , reduce intensity method transplantation require high dos chemotherapy . The purpose study examine safety effectiveness nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplant use partially match bone marrow donate family member treatment option people leukemia lymphoma . This study enroll people leukemia lymphoma family member partial tissue match . Participants admit hospital first receive type chemotherapy call fludarabine , give intravenously 5 day . In addition , another type chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , give intravenously first second day . After 5 day , participant receive small dose radiation . The next day , participant undergo bone marrow transplant . The third fourth day transplant , participant receive high dos cyclophosphamide help prevent two complication , graft rejection , occur body 's immune system reject donor bone marrow , graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , attack donor cell body 's normal tissue . On fifth day transplant , participant receive two additional medication , tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , help prevent GVHD ; participant may receive cyclosporine instead tacrolimus . Participants receive MMF 5 week tacrolimus 6 month . Also begin fifth day transplant , participant receive daily injection growth factor call granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , natural protein increase white blood cell count ; G-CSF continue participant 's white blood cell count normal . Participants remain hospital approximately 2 3 month , possibly longer complication . While participant hospital , blood sample collect regularly evaluate response possible side effect treatment , include GVHD . If necessary , participant receive platelet red blood cell transfusion . Follow-up study visit occur 6 month 1 year transplant . At Months 1 , 2 , 6 , 12 transplant , blood bone marrow sample obtain . Study researcher keep track participant ' medical condition phone call mailing participant doctor year rest participant ' life .</detailed_description>
