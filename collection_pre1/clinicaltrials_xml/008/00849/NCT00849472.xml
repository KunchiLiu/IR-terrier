	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether treatment doxorubicin combination cyclophosphamide follow combination pazopanib combination paclitaxel prior surgery result pathological complete response female breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With Pazopanib Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II non-randomized , multi-center study aim evaluate efficacy safety combination pazopanib paclitaxel follow treatment cyclophosphamide doxorubicin treatment neoadjuvant breast cancer . Patients receive standard dos AC every 21 day 4 cycle . This follow weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV Days 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day 4 cycle give concurrently pazopanib 800 mg PO daily start first paclitaxel dose continue 7 day surgery . Clinical complete response rate determine tumor assessment perform palpation two time point : follow AC ( paclitaxel/pazopanib begin ) 2-4 week follow last dose paclitaxel ( surgery ) . Following recovery preoperative therapy , patient undergo clinically-indicated surgery . Pazopanib resume 4-6 week surgery continue daily 6 month postoperative pazopanib therapy .</detailed_description>
