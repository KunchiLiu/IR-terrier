	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving bortezomib together gemcitabine hydrochloride rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose bortezomib gemcitabine hydrochloride give together rituximab see well work treat patient progressive relapse B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary : I . To evaluate safety feasibility combine VELCADE ( bortezomib ) gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) patient recurrent lymphoma standard therapy . II . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) gemcitabine Rituxan ( rituximab ) administer combination VELCADE give 21-day ( old schema - Schema I ) 28-day ( amend schema - Schema II ) schedule . Secondary : I . To obtain preliminary data response regimen patient population . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study bortezomib gemcitabine hydrochloride follow phase II study . Patients receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) , gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 3-4 hour , rituximab IV day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
