	<brief_summary>Many graft place dialysis access fail cause patient undergo additional operation , decrease quality life , increase health care cost . The purpose study see dialysis access graft function long patient receive additional oxygen mean nasal cannula 42 day placement graft . Patients periodic blood test measure oxygen level blood . A series ultrasound examination patient 's dialysis graft take ensure graft open measure cellular proliferation ( intimal hyperplasia ) comparison receive extra oxygen oxygen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Oxygen Healing Artery From `` Injury '' Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular bypass graft commonly perform procedure vascular cardiovascular surgery preferred bypass graft autogenous vein . Creation vascular anastomosis ( AVA ) require 2 site ( proximal distal anastomosis ) every synthetic bypass graft . It estimate 50 % vascular bypass failure due anastomotic intimal hyperplasia ( AIH ) . Intimal thicken artery wall normal response heal anastomosis . Progression intimal thicken lead pathological , hyperplastic , occlusive lesion - AIH , turn result myocardial infarction , stroke , limb loss , death , graft failure , repeat operative procedure , increase medical cost . Our laboratory demonstrate rabbit model AIH : 1 ) significant decrease delivery oxygen peri-anastomotic artery wall follow creation prosthetic vascular graft artery anastomosis , 2 ) oxygen gradient across artery wall area prosthetic vascular graft anastomosis normalizes period 6 week heal occurs , 3 ) gradient normalize immediately follow anastomosis administration supplemental oxygen , 4 ) amount AIH smooth muscle cell proliferation reduce immediately administer supplemental oxygen follow creation anastomosis . The long-range goal program understand role oxygen blood vessel wall pathology . The specific objective project , next step pursuit long-range program goal , determine supplemental oxygen inhibit AIH human graft model . METHODS : Following review inclusion exclusion criterion suitable patient undergo surgical placement graft hemodialysis . Following surgery , patient randomize oxygen breathe 5L supplemental oxygen waking hour 42 day . Periodic ultrasounds take ass graft function patency measure intimal thickness . Patients follow two year graft fails .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 1880+/ refer consider candidate synthetic hemodialysis access graft . 2 . Baseline room air arterial blood concentration &gt; 70 arterial carbon dioxide concentration 45 mmHg . Pulmonary function test &gt; 75 % predict value 3 . Currently undergo dialysis 4 . No previous synthetic hemodialysis graft place arm ( fistula ipsilateral arm permit ) 5 . Ability use 5L/minute supplemental oxygen nasal cannula 6 . Nonsmoker , able avoid situation would constitute risk use oxygen 7 . Medical condition &gt; 1 year life expectancy 8 . Currently medication would interfere wound healing ( i.e . steroid , chemotherapeutic agent ) 9 . Not pregnant plan become pregnant study period 1 . Failure meet inclusion criterion 2 . Failure comply study protocol 3 consecutive day 6 wk oxygen/nonoxygen supplement period immediately follow graft placement 3 . Medical condition develop study period cause significantly worsen pulmonary function require supplemental oxygen &gt; 3 day 4 . Need take medication study period would interfere wound heal time 6 week period immediately follow graft placement need take chronic medication ( &gt; 6 week ) remainder study period . 5 . Patient desire withdraw 6 . Failure evidence adequate increase arterial blood oxygen concentration ( pa02 &gt; 115 oxygen supplement pa02 &gt; 55 mmHg control obtain arterial access port dialysis run 7 . Failure use supplemental oxygen ( supplemental oxygen group ) least 18 hour per day ( record journal )</criteria>
