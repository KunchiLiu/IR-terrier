	<brief_summary>Background : - P. falciparum , one virulent form malaria , cause 300 million episode malaria 1 million death year . The spread drug-resistant parasite , insecticide-resistant mosquito , persistent socioeconomic condition poverty compound difficulty malaria major global health problem . New mean disease vector control vitally need . - Several promising strategy rely target mosquito population vulnerable , dry season mosquito find difficult reproduce . Large region West African country Mali prolong dry season ( 8 month ) , mosquito population dramatically decline within month rainfall cease . Clearly , mosquito survive dry season ( evident robust number wet season ) process enable remain unknown . Targeting small fragile mosquito population end dry season could reduce eliminate number mosquito certain region , provide great benefit community dry region . Objectives : - To determine common malaria-carrying mosquito survive dry season Mali village Thierola estivation ( go dormant , hibernate , dry period ) . - To identify examine mosquito mark special paint previous protocol , mark mosquito capture investigation . Eligibility : - All activity protocol take place Thierola village , Banamba district , Koulikoro region , Mall , West Africa . The village choose isolated community least 6 km small community le 300 inhabitant live 90 house . - Participants healthy adult men 18 65 year age . Design : - Thirty adult men live Thierola recruit participate mosquito collector human-baited trap method work teams two . - The first collector expose low leg attract human-seeking mosquito . Using mouth aspirator , second collector collect mosquito land first collector 's leg . - The collection conduct indoors outdoors 6 p.m. 6 a.m. follow morning 14 consecutive day . - All study volunteer train proper collection technique supervise throughout study mobile team lead study investigator . Volunteers monitor sign malaria treat accordingly develop symptoms disease . - Researchers collect mosquito sample end dry season ( April-May ) start rainy season ( May-June ) . - Mosquitoes collect study analyze NIH researcher learn survive dry season .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Estivation Malaria Vector Mosquitoes Sahelian Region Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria cause one million death annually . A promising control strategy relies target mosquito population vulnerable , dry season . Prolonged dry season larval sit scarce mosquito population decline prevail Sahel cover large part Mali . How mosquitoes withstand dry season remain unknown . Some evidence support adult estivation hypothesis whereby mosquito remain protected site , except sporadic journey obtain blood-meals sustain rather produce egg . Alternatively , mosquito survive dry season locally ; rather , migrate area reproduction continue permanent water body . We aim determine An . Gambiae estivate dry season Sahel ; , identify hidden resting site . As mosquito population decline , standard sample technique yield zero mosquito . Because estivate female take blood meal intermittently , promise sample technique human land catch ( HLC ) . Finding mosquito dry season report , could determine estivate migrant village , larval site persist . This study resolve capture marked release 5000 mosquito dry season ( November 2008 ) . We aim collect mosquito end dry season ( April 2009 ) onset rainy season ( June 2009 ) find bear mark previous wet season . Finding single mark specimen ultimate proof estivation hypothesis . Experiments take place Sahelian village Thierola , Koulikoro Region , Mali , dry season exceed 7 month . The village choose permanent larval sit small community ( &lt; 300 inhabitant ) live 90 house , allow collection house single day . Thirty adult male reside Thierola recruit collector HLC . A collector expose lower legs attract mosquito . Using mouth aspirator , mosquito collect land collector 's leg , ideally , blood meal take . Collection conduct 6pm 6am 14 consecutive day April 2009 rain begin June 2009 . Collectors inform proper collecting procedure consent procedure . During time year propose conduct work , mosquito population minima survive mosquito take blood meal infrequently . Therefore , HLCs conduct malaria transmission extremely low risk volunteer essentially nil . In summary , knowledge mosquito survive dry season would open novel way vector malaria control .</detailed_description>
