	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , clofarabine cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving clofarabine together cytarabine may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This pilot phase II trial study well give clofarabine together cytarabine work treat patient acute myeloid leukemia minimal residual disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine Cytarabine Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Minimal Residual Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test ability clofarabine + ara-C ( cytarabine ) eliminate minimal residual ( MRD ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient whose bone marrows exhibit complete remission morphology . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration complete remission treatment minimize MRD . OUTLINE : Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) day 1-5 clofarabine intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour cytarabine IV day 2-5 . Beginning approximately 1 month later , patient may receive one additional course treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
