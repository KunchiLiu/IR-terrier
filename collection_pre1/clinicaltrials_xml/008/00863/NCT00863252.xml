	<brief_summary>IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ) commonest primary glomerulonephritis worldwide . In Hong Kong , IgAN account approximately 30 % primary glomerular disease , significant proportion young patient ( &lt; 50 year age ) dialysis therapy sufferer primary IgAN . To date , specific therapeutic agent consistently show halt progression IgAN end-stage renal failure , particularly patient persistent significant proteinuria presence chronic tubulointerstitial inflammation kidney biopsy . In recent year , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) find capable significantly reduce proteinuria IgAN patient , others , particularly ACE DD genotype , show either absent unsatisfactory response angiotensin blockade . Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) market immunosuppressive drug act release mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) inhibit de novo pathway purine synthesis , hence relatively selective lymphocyte . Apart efficacious prophylaxis renal allograft rejection induction remission severe lupus nephritis , MMF anecdotally report avert progression allograft failure recurrent IgAN transplant kidney . Data clinical efficacy MMF treatment primary IgAN , however , lack . In current proposal , aim study clinical efficacy MMF patient biopsy-proven IgAN clinically significant proteinuria despite angiotensin blockade . Patients follow least 5 year track survival difference group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>( ) STUDY DESIGN This prospective , randomize , open-label , case-controlled study . Patients either gender biopsy-proven IgAN clinically significant proteinuria despite ACEI treatment potential candidate ( see selection criterion ) . Eligible patient randomize either follow group : Group I ( Intervention arm ) : Patients give MMF daily dose 1.5 g orally 2 divided dos addition concurrent medication , include ACEI . Duration therapy expect six month . Group II ( Control arm ) : Patient continue receive concurrent medication , include ACEI angiotensin receptor blocker , discretion attend renal physician . ( ii ) PATIENT SELECTION CRITERIA Inclusion criterion - Males female age 18 70 year - Renal biopsy show histological diagnosis IgAN , predominant codominant mesangial deposition IgA immunofluorescent study - Daily urinary protein excretion &gt; 1 g least 3 separate occasion - Serum creatinine &lt; 400 umol/L - Patients willing give write informed consent participate comply study protocol Exclusion criterion - Presence concomitant glomerular disease - Patients know hypersensitivity MMF - Patients receive treatment cytotoxic agent - Serum creatinine &gt; 400 umol/L - Women lactate , pregnant childbearing potential use , unwilling use , reliable contraceptive method 6 week follow conclusion MMF therapy . A pregnancy test exclude pregnancy perform woman childbearing potential prior recruitment - Patients unable unwilling give write informed consent participate comply study protocol - Presence systemic infection malignancy require therapy time entry study - Patients simultaneously participate another study participate another study within last 30 day entry study ( iii ) PATIENT MONITORING Patient record The record every recruit patient contain follow information : - Demographic data - Medical history include concomitant illness - All concomitant medication - Other significant information Timing Assessments All study assessment calculate date study entry . The study follow-up schedule follow : - Baseline , - Two-weekly first month , - Monthly 2nd - 6th month , end MMF withdrawn , - Three-monthly least 5 year follow</detailed_description>
