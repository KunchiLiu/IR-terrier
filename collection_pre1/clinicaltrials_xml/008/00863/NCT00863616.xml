	<brief_summary>Patients Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) tend cough , excess mucus production breathlessness cardinal feature . The excess mucus production often lead frequent infection , exacerbation poor quality life . Mucociliary clearance may impact improve symptom , exercise tolerance , quality life reduce exacerbation . High frequency chest wall oscillation ( HFCWO ) device use percussion chest wall deliver pump close fit inflatable vest . This technique show enhance mucus clearance patient cystic fibrosis Bronchiectasis . This pilot study design explore feasibility , tolerance effectiveness HFCWO patient advance COPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.1 Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) major health problem across world medical , societal economic impact continue grow . COPD characterize chronic obstruction expiratory flow affect peripheral airway , associate chronic bronchitis ( mucus hypersecretion goblet cell submucosal gland hyperplasia ) emphysema ( destruction airway parenchyma ) , together fibrosis tissue damage , inflammation small airways1 . The beneficial effect smoke cessation slow decline lung function progression disease clearly establish . Whether factor mucus hypersecretion , respiratory infection airway hyper-reactivity contribute disease progression independent cigarette smoking still debated2 . Patients COPD often distress mucus hypersecretion one hallmarks disease little known impact current therapy mucus hypersecretion due logistical challenge objectively quantify mucus clinical study 3 . Mucus hypersecretion occur direct result airway inflammation . Neutrophils die necrosis disgorge protease reactive oxygen specie lumen . It conclude neutrophil death via necrosis lead high concentration free neutrophil elastase reactive oxygen specie sputum patient airway neutrophilia mucus hypersecretion . Inflammatory cell ( neutrophil ) , molecule ( neutrophil elastase reactive oxygen specie ) , signal pathway ( EGFR ) , cellular process ( neutrophil necrosis ) contribute mucus hypersecretion COPD4 . Mucus hypersecretion lead increase work breathing , reduce exercise tolerance , deteriorate lung function increase dyspnoea cough . Often mucus hypersecretion also interfere nocturnal sleep negative impact health relate quality life . Combined mucus hypersecretion , reduce clearance , impairment lung defence mechanism explain COPD patient even stable condition , carry potential respiratory pathogen significant concentration , pave way infection acute exacerbation COPD5 ; 6 . In natural history COPD chronic mucus hypersecretion think link accelerated decline force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) 5 7 . Although mucoactive drug ( improve ease mucus clearance ) may effective mucus hypersecretion , uncertainty surround effectiveness , due primarily relative lack evidence randomise controlled trial uncertainty epidemiological study link mucus hypersecretion mortality8-11 , lead poor diffusion adoption international guideline 7 . However , combination newer therapeutic strategy currently research development phase target airway inflammation thus reduce mucus hypersecretion , renew interest re-evaluating mucus clearance strategy improve HRQL , exacerbation morbidity associate COPD 12 ; 13 . Airway clearance form vital part management patient CF14 , Bronchiectasis neuro-muscular diseases15 positive impact lung function , infection rate mortality16 ; 17 . Individually tailored chest physiotherapy18 force expiratory manoeuvre often consider gold standard airway clearance19 , although self-administered technique may equally effective20 preferred patients17 ; 21 . Self-administered airway clearance technique use device create turbulent airflow thus encourage shear mucus bronchial wall , show promise improve HRQL function COPD patients22 . High frequency chest wall oscillation ( HFCWO ) 23 know reduce respiratory rate improve ventilation patient COPD24 CF25 . Experimental result suggest shear air-mucus interface could significant factor enhance tracheal mucus clearance HFCWO26 . Unlike CF patient often great support family member show high level motivation thus compliance adhere self-administered airway clearance technique , COPD patient low motivation poor compliance . Thus self-administered technique mucosal clearance may less effective clinical setting away dedicate research program . Thus HCFWO may offer passive modality airway clearance consequently high compliance , find equally effective well-tolerated group patient . If HFCWO show improve HRQL , symptom exercise tolerance may significant role reduce exacerbation hospital admission well allow effective management community set . The cost benefit improvement need explore large study future .</detailed_description>
