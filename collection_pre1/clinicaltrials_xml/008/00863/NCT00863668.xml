	<brief_summary>The reduction antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) HIV RNA blood , HIV RNA infect cell virus associate follicular dendritic cell ( FDC ) network lymphatic tissue , typically follow two-phase pattern decline . The half-life first-phase 1 day second phase 14 day , comparable estimate first-phase decay SIV-infected rhesus macaque . While substantial evidence support current view first-phase decay reflect death activate CD4+ T cell infect ART begin , source viral RNA second phase yet conclusively establish . Possible source viral RNA invoke mathematical model , experimental evidence , include longer-lived infected cell macrophage rest CD4+ T cell , dissociation virus FDC network , productively infected CD4+ T cell subject clearance host immune response wan level HIV antigen . Raltegravir ( MK-0518 ) belong new class integrase inhibitor potently suppress HIV SIV replication , reportedly markedly alters second phase HIV decline way challenge current view longer-lived infected cell source virus phase . While mathematical model decay HIV RNA blood consistent 1 ) cell newly infect long-lived cell , 2 ) activation latently infected cell full-length unintegrated HIV DNA source second phase virus , think data also quite consistent great efficacy integrase inhibitor particular cell type and/or anatomic site gut . In protocol test hypothesis rapid decrease HIV replication associate raltegravir due complete suppression viral replication lymphatic compartment lymph node gastrointestinal lymphatic tissue . We also investigate compartment-specific intracellular level raltegravir potentially explain difference change compartment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study evaluate rate HIV elimination peripheral blood comparison secondary lymphatic tissue , include inguinal lymph node ( LN ) gastrointestinal lymphatic tissue ( GALT ) . HIV-infected patient antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) naive fit criterion initiate ART randomize either Truvada ( tenofovir/emtricitabine ) + Sustiva ( efavirenz - 600mg qDAY orally - standard care ) Truvada + Isentress ( raltegravir - 400mg BID orally ) . Patients blood draw , colonoscopy biopsy , inguinal lymph node excision day 0 , 2 , 7 , 14 , week 52 . Plasma HIV RNA CD4+ T cell quantitation perform conventionally . HIV mRNA quantitated LN GALT use in-situ hybridization ( ISH ) . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) perform quantitate change CD4+ cell number time tissue respective ART regimen .</detailed_description>
