	<brief_summary>Background : The ability immune system function decline age . This reflect marked decrease responsiveness vaccination infectious agent . Consequentially , profound reduction quality live increase dependency health system . Studies show production B lymphocytes bone marrow decline age long-lived B cell accumulate periphery . Thus , instead juvenile repertoire B cell capable recognize new pathogen , repertoire elderly becomes restrict fails respond new antigen . Working hypothesis aim : We hypothesize dramatic change cellular composition age reflect homeostasis pressure set long-lived peripheral B cell . Here , investigator hypothesize alter homeostasis , active depletion peripheral B cell , revive B lymphopoiesis BM rejuvenate peripheral repertoire B cell age . Consequentially , significantly improve immune responsiveness age individual new antigenic challenge . Methods : The investigator propose parallel study human mouse . For clinical study use old lymphoma patient treat B cell deplete therapy , RITUXIMAB , transient B cell depletion establish full B cell reconstitution . We test responsiveness patient hepatitis B vaccine compare aged-matched control group . The investigator also use old human CD20 transgenic mouse B cell depletion impose anti human CD20 antibody . In experiment study physiological immunological change understand age mechanism B lineage . Expected result : We expect old patient treat B cell depletion increase responsiveness hepatitis B vaccine relative control group . Importance : The investigator propose efficient approach improve immune response elderly population . This increase efficacy vaccination , reduce morbidity improve quality life . It also reduce cost medical treatment . In addition , study show senescence B lineage reverse , contrast general concept age . Probable implication welfare health age population Medicine : Improving immune competence increase efficacy vaccination , reduce morbidity , reduce dependency health system . This significantly improve quality life .</brief_summary>
