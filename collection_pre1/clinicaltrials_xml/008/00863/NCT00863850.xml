	<criteria>Key The patient must histologically cytologically confirm , relapse refractory malignancy , except uveal melanoma , sarcoma primary brain tumor . Additionally , malignancy must consider unresponsive poorly responsive accept treatment modality . The patient World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status 02 . The patient estimate life expectancy least 3 month . The patient , woman , surgically sterile , 2 year postmenopausal , , child bear potential , use medically accept method contraception , agree continue use method duration study 90 day discontinuation study drug . Acceptable method contraception include abstinence intrauterine device ( IUD ) know failure rate le 1 % per year . The patient , man , surgically sterile , , capable produce offspring , currently use approve method birth control agree continue use method duration study ( 90 day take last dose study medication ) . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1000 cells/mm3 , platelet count ≥100000 cells/mm3 , hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL . The patient adequate hepatic function . For patient without liver metastasis , adequate hepatic function define ≤2.5 x upper limit normal range [ ULN ] aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] , ≤1.5 x ULN total bilirubin . For patient liver metastasis , adequate hepatic function define ≤5 x ULN AST ALT , ≤1.5 x ULN total bilirubin . Patients nonclinically significant elevation bilirubin due know suspect Gilbert 's disease eligible ; must document medical history page case report form ( CRF ) . The patient calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/minute determine CockcroftGault equation . Key The patient chemotherapy , radiotherapy , radioimmunotherapy , immunotherapy within 28 day prior first dose study drug recover adverse event due agent administer previously . For patient receive therapy mitomycin C , interval 42 day . The patient know cerebral metastasis . The patient receive treatment bendamustine hematologic/nonhematologic malignancy . The patient previous treatment bendamustine . The patient treat hematopoietic growth factor within 14 day study entry ( patient chronic erythropoiesis stimulate agent allow ) . The patient pregnant lactating . The patient serious infection , medical condition , psychiatric condition , opinion investigator , preclude patient participate study . The patient know positive test result human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) history HIV disease . The patient presence inflammatory bowel disease , occlusion gastrointestinal tract , significant constipation , condition result clinically significant obstruction urinary tract . The patient require treatment cytochrome P450 1A2 ( CYP1A2 ) inducer inhibitors day 1 8 cycle 1 , use CYP1A2 inhibitor within 14 day 1st administration study drug , use CYP1A2 inducer within 30 day 1st administration study drug . The patient smoker exsmoker stop smoke less 3 month 1st dose study drug use use topical oral nicotine preparation smoke cessation within past 3 month 1st dose study drug . The patient know hypersensitivity bendamustine component ( i.e. , mannitol ) .</criteria>
