	<brief_summary>Ablation atrial fibrillation well establish treatment method restore normal sinus rhythm eliminate need continue antiarrhythmic therapy anticoagulation . Absence symptomatic asymptomatic atrial fibrillation consider necessary discontinuation anticoagulation therapy . Presently , recurrence atrial fibrillation usually determine use non loop event monitor typically use subject time symptomatic arrhythmia . This method detect asymptomatic atrial fibrillation . Random asymptomatic recording add , chance detect recurrence arrhythmia great . Too frequently , success rate AF ablation procedure inflate insufficient follow patient 's limited compliance report record episode recurrent arrhythmia . Often time , inconvenient patient wear external event recorder . Allergies sticky pad need external monitoring device continue problem . Implantable loop recorder advantage detect symptomatic asymptomatic atrial fibrillation continuously . They also offer convenience monitoring 18 24 month without significant patient discomfort . However , implantation explantation device involve limited surgical procedure well considerable experience . In study attempt assess difference two type monitor system assess long term efficacy AF ablation .</brief_summary>
