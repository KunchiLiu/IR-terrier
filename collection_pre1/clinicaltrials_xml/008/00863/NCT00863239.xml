	<detailed_description>The aim SELECT-2 study compare safety efficacy Locteron PegIntron . SELECT-2 72-week Phase 2b , multicenter , international trial treatment-naïve genotype-1 chronic HCV subject randomize 1:1:1:1 dose one three dos [ 640ug ( n=29 ) , 480ug ( n=29 ) , 320ug ( n=28 ) ] q2week Locteron weekly dos 1.5ug/kg PEG2b ( n=30 ) . Subjects receive regimen combination weight-based ribavirin ( 800-1400 mg ) 48 week . Subjects staff blind Locteron dose first 12 week . Subjects without early virologic response 12 week , without viral negativity 24 week , discontinue treatment lack efficacy . Adverse event include flu symptom depression , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , Short Form-36 , HCV RNA safety lab measure standard interval clinic visit Week 72 .
