	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Treating lymphocytes laboratory may help lymphocyte kill tumor cell put back body . Aldesleukin may stimulate lymphocyte kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide fludarabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving laboratory-treated lymphocyte aldesleukin together cyclophosphamide fludarabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well laboratory-treated autologous lymphocyte aldesleukin work give cyclophosphamide fludarabine treat patient metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laboratory-Treated Autologous Lymphocytes Aldesleukin After Cyclophosphamide Fludarabine Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine ability treatment short-term culture autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) combination high-dose aldesleukin nonmyeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen comprise cyclophosphamide fludarabine phosphate mediate tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma . - Determine toxicity treatment regimen . Secondary - Determine rate repopulation young TIL cell . - Establish vitro immunological correlate predict vivo persistence clinical response . OUTLINE : - Conditioning regimen : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day -7 -6 fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute day -5 -1 . - Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) infusion high-dose aldesleukin : Patients receive short-term culture autologous TIL IV 20-30 minute day 0 . Patients also receive high-dose aldesleukin IV 15 minute every 8 hour day 0-4 . Patients stable disease , partial response , recurrent disease initial response may receive 1 additional course treatment ( ) begin 8 week completion aldesleukin . Blood sample collect baseline , 1 week 1 month TIL infusion , periodically thereafter research study . Samples analyze difference function phenotype prior TIL infusion . The immunological correlate treatment also evaluate use FACS , cytokine release assay , ELISPOT assay , flow cytometry , PCR . TIL cryopreserved time infusion analyze determine cell phenotype function ; correlation vitro characteristic infused cell vivo antitumor activity ; activity , specificity , telomere length use flow FISH . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
