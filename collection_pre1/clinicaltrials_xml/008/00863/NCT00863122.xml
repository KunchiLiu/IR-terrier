	<brief_summary>Tumors grow auditory nerve cause hearing loss . A common type tumor vestibular schwannoma ( VS ) , acoustic neuroma . These tumor cancerous . Most often , people one VS . Occasionally , people one VS may condition call neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) . Because VS cause hearing loss , many people VS treatment preserve hearing . This treatment usually involve surgery radiation therapy . There risks procedure , sometimes work prevent hearing loss . Because surgery radiation risk able help everyone VS , method treatment explore . One area exploration look see drug take might prevent VS grow large cause hearing loss , might possibly even cause VS shrink size . This study explore whether drug approve FDA currently use treat breast cancer might also work treat VS . This study measure amount drug travel bloodstream arrive tumor . This drug safe side effect . If drug show reach tumor , might use future treat VS without need surgery radiation . This study recruit people surgery VS . If go surgery treat VS , may eligible participate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder incidence approximately 1/40,000 . The common tumor type NF2 vestibular schwannoma majority NF2 patient develop progressive hearing loss adolescence young adulthood due bilateral vestibular schwannoma ( VS ) . In addition hearing loss , VS cause significant morbidity , case mortality , due brain stem compression . Currently , accept modality treatment VS patient NF2 surgical resection . Although surgical resection effective tumor reduction , often associate morbid complication hear loss , facial palsy , CSF leak , chronic headache infection . In addition , tumor often recur surgery . Radiation therapy ( RT ) propose alternative , however , safety NF2 population establish concern long term efficacy . For distinct population NF2 patient , surgery RT feasible additional therapy currently available . Hence , systemic therapy need . Sporadic VS common roughly 3,000 new case per year United States grow incidence recent year . These tumor cause unilateral hearing loss , tinnitus , vertigo . The primary treatment modality tumor surgical resection radiosurgery . Surgery associate complication list NF2-related VS . Hence , RT often offer place surgery . Although consider safe sporadic VS , may good long term efficacy may complicate future procedure . Again , systemic therapy could control tumor progression obviate need invasive procedure need . As understanding tumor molecular biology continue advance , increase number attractive target VS growth inhibition . EGFR ErbB2 identify important target VS . In study 21 sporadic 17 NF2-related VS sample , EGFR ErbB2 find upregulated majority tumor . In addition , anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody reduce schwannoma cell proliferation vitro . Collectively , data suggests abnormal signal via EGFR ErbB2 major contributor tumor growth progression sporadic NF2-related VS , inhibition signal pathway result decreased tumor growth . Although agent target pathway commercially available , little pre-clinical data assist prioritize agent advance clinical trial . Given relative rarity disorder enormous patient , financial time commitment efficacy study require , need carefully select agent test best chance success . In trial , propose assess delivery lapatinib , commercially available inhibitor ErbB2 EGFR , VS via tissue sample time clinically indicate surgery . Demonstrating lapatinib reach meaningful intratumoral concentration important data recommend drug small molecule inhibitor efficacy trial VS . The primary objective determine steady state concentration lapatinib VS patient NF2 patient sporadic VS . Patient plan surgical resection tumor clinical indication give lapatinib 15 day prior resection . At time resection , VS tissue assess drug concentration molecular marker drug activity . Demonstrating lapatinib reach meaningful concentration within VS would support select agent investigation efficacy study VS , tissue-based molecular study provide corollary information behavior VS general lapatinib specifically VS tissue . This may understand pathophysiology VS , similarity difference NF2-related sporadic VS , inform design subsequent efficacy trial .</detailed_description>
