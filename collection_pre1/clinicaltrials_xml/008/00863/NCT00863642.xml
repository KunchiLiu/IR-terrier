	<brief_summary>While exists consensus among surgeon patient gallstone pancreatitis undergo cholecystectomy prevent recurrence , precise timing laparoscopic cholecystectomy mild moderate disease remain controversial . We hypothesize laparoscopic cholecystectomy perform within 48 hour admission , regardless resolution abdominal pain abnormal laboratory value , result shorter hospital stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis common diagnosis worldwide , 220,000 case report annually United States alone . The lead etiology gallstones.1 Gallstone pancreatitis think occur due transient obstruction common channel drain biliary pancreatic duct , result inflammation pancreas . The pancreatitis ensue usually mild self-limited treatment initially supportive subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) . However , small subgroup patient develop severe pancreatitis and/or concomitant cholangitis . When latter present , ERC sphincterotomy stone extraction indicate typically perform . While clear consensus patient present gallstone pancreatitis undergo cholecystectomy prevent recurrence , precise timing surgery remain controversial . In patient severe pancreatitis ( Ranson 's &gt; 3 ) , consensus surgery delay pancreatitis resolve early operation associate high complication rate . 2 However , despite 30 year debate surgical literature , optimal timing surgery mild moderate pancreatitis ( Ranson 's ≤ 3 ) remain unclear . With recurrence rate gallstone pancreatitis report high 63 % 3 repeat attack occur within two week initial index presentation1 , investigator recommend cholecystectomy initial hospitalization.4,5 Still , actual timing surgery initial index hospitalization unsettle . In practice , surgeon often delay surgery evidence complete resolution inflammatory process , evidence absence abdominal pain normalization liver functional test pancreatic enzymes.6 Unfortunately , strategy may result prolongation hospitalization without proven benefit . A previous prospective , non-randomized study institution suggest early cholecystectomy could safely perform within 48 hour admission patient mild moderate pancreatitis , regardless resolution abdominal pain abnormal laboratory value . In study , compare retrospective control group surgery delay resolution clinical laboratory parameter , hospital stay significantly reduce median 7 day 4 day , without additional complications.7 In order address optimal timing surgery definite fashion , prospective randomize study perform patient mild moderate gallstone pancreatitis allocate either early group ( surgery within 48 hour presentation ) control group ( surgery resolution abdominal pain normalization laboratory value ) assess overall outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All adult include age 18 100 mild moderate gallstone pancreatitis . A subject classified gallstone pancreatitis follow : 1. upper abdominal pain , nausea , vomit epigastric tenderness ; 2. absence ethanol abuse ; 3. elevate amylase level least twice upper limit normal elevated lipase level lease three time upper limit normal ; 4. image confirmation gallstone . The classification mild moderate pancreatitis define presence following : 1. three few Ranson 's criterion admission : age &gt; 55 year , glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL , LDH &gt; 350 mg/dL , AST &gt; 250 units/L , WBC &gt; 16 K/mm3 ; 2. clinical stability admission nonmonitored ward bed ; 3. absence acute cholangitis : defined temperature &gt; 38.6°C , right upper quadrant pain tenderness , significant hyperbilirubinemia ; 4. low suspicion retain common bile duct ( CBD ) stone ( total bilirubin &lt; 4 mg/dl admission ) . Severe pancreatitis ( define presence three Ranson 's criterion admission ) ; Suspected concomitant acute cholangitis ; High suspicion retain common bile duct stone ( total bilirubin ≥ 4 mg/dl admission ultrasound demonstration CBD stone ) ; Patient refusal participate ; Severe preexist medical comorbidities contraindicate cholecystectomy ( determined primary physician ) ; Pregnancy , Prior gastric bypass surgery ( make ERC difficult ) Admission monitor unit . The need admission monitor bed determine admit surgeon guide primarily need aggressive fluid administration demonstrate severe volume depletion ( e.g. , admission tachycardia &gt; 110 beats/minute , blood urea nitrogen &gt; 15 mg/dl ) evidence cholangitis .</criteria>
