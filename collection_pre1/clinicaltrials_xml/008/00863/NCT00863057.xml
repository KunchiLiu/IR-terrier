	<brief_summary>Neuropathy result damage nerves foot leg . It usually experience pain , tingle numbness . In HIV-infected people , neuropathy result infection side effect antiretroviral treatment . The purpose study determine whether two different drug , methadone duloxetine , reduce neuropathy-associated pain HIV-infected people . This study also examine whether utilization drug effective treatment one .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripheral neuropathy recognize common neurological complication HIV disease treatment . Before highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) introduce , prevalence HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy ( DSP ) already estimate 35 % , mostly contain population moderate advanced immunosuppression . Now , since advent HAART , prevalence HIV-associated neuropathy increase 52 % , possibly due combination antiretroviral toxic neuropathy ( ATN ) , decreased mortality , accumulate medical comorbidities . Successful treatment neuropathic pain inherently difficult , treatment HIV-associated neuropathic pain particularly complicate . To date , evidence support effective therapy neuropathic HIV-associated pain lacking , despite several type class drug evaluate clinical trial . This study evaluate safety efficacy duloxetine , methadone , combination duloxetine methadone painful HIV-associated neuropathy . Both drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) purpose unrelated HIV-associated neuropathy , previous study utilize two treatment purpose . For study , 120 participant painful HIV-associated neuropathy recruit . The trial last approximately 23 week . Each participant receive total 4 study treatment . The following treatment pairing give sequence determine randomization : 1. duloxetine methadone placebo 2. methadone duloxetine placebo 3. duloxetine methadone 4. duloxetine placebo methadone placebo Each treatment period last 4 week follow 1-week combined taper washout . People wish enroll study screen visit last 3 hour . During visit , participant HIV test , physical exam , neurologic exam , blood drawn , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , pregnancy test , applicable . Participants also ask current health medication may take . They also ask mood give result test perform screen visit . If screening qualifies participant study , return pre-entry visit last 2 hour . During visit , participant limit physical exam ask change health medicine since screen . Participants also give pain diary instruction record neuropathy pain every day 7 day begin study throughout study . After begin study , participant return clinic another 8 visit . These visit end 4-week treatment period end 1-week crossover period . At visit , limited physical exam participant answer question health medication . Participants also tell result routine lab test pregnancy test perform study .</detailed_description>
