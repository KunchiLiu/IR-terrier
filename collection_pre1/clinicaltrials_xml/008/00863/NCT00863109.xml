	<brief_title>Quality Life During Treatment Chronic Hepatitis C ( P05278/MK-4031-336 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As widely show previous report Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) patient commonly experience fatigue , anxiety , depression . These symptom negatively affect patient ' functional health , ability work , self-perceived health , HRQL well-being . Psychosocial issue reduce HRQL frequently experience HCV patient . HCV patient HRQL impairment general population . There evidence HCV patient experience great fatigue , great psychiatric symptom , poorer HRQL likely discontinue treatment prematurely , negative impact virological response . In addition well-known side effect interferon , one important determinant HRQL anti-viral therapy HCV development RBV-induced anemia . Treatment anemia improves HRQL , potentially impact adherence antiviral regimen improve virologic response . These issue emphasize importance investigate physical psychosocial experience HRQL HCV patient . The sample size study must allow evaluate HRQL HCV patient base SF-36 PEG treatment follow study visit . To able detect difference 4.2 point vitality dimension basal visit follow visit , estimate standard deviation 22 point , statistical power 80 % , level significance 0.05 , 216 patient need . Considering loss follow 15 % , total 238 patient plan study .</detailed_description>
