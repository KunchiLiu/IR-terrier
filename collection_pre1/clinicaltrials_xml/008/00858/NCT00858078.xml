	<brief_summary>Background : - Mutations detect BRCA1 BRCA2 gene show produce high risk breast ovarian cancer ( high 90 % 60 % , respectively ) , well accompany risk several type cancer . Women genetic anomaly cancer aware high-risk status , effect ability make decision personal choice health care . - Researchers interested learn people know cancer risk status make decision personal relationship , family formation , risk-reduction option . Objectives : - To study young woman experience decision-making process regard family history , genetic testing , couple relationship , family formation , cancer risk management within context experience BRCA1/2 mutation carrier . Eligibility : - Women age 18 35 year age old identify BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation . Participants must contemplate experienced couple relationship , family formation , and/or risk management reduction . - Participants must willing interview digitally record Design : - Researchers conduct 30 50 telephone interview study participant . Each interview approximately 90 minute length . The interview consist open-ended question ask participant experience , , underwent genetic test BRCA1/2 . - At least one focus group coordinate national conference individual aware genetically base cancer risk . If 25 individual interested participate group , additional focus group convene . - No medical treatment specifically offer part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Qualitative Exploration Impact Positive BRCA1/2 Mutation Status Lives Young Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - BRCA1/2 mutation present approximately 1 800 individual US , high frequency among population ( e.g. , Ashkenazi Jews ) - Mutations confer lifetime breast cancer risk approach 90 % , ovarian cancer risk high 60 % , less increase absolute risk select cancer ( e.g. , male breast , prostate , pancreas ) . - We successfully conduct follow-up interview woman original study know mutation less six month , glean useful longitudinal data . We propose conduct additional follow-up interview participant process make significant decision risk-management , relationship , family formation , pertinent issue time initial interview . - Additionally , previous research indicate woman undergo genetic test early young adulthood ( i.e. , prior 25th birthday ) genetic counsel support need different broad BRCA-positive population . - Research regard young mutation carrier manage accommodate risk scarce . We propose conduct two focus group woman consider and/or underwent genetic testing BRCA prior 25th birthday , attend Joining FORCES annual conference Orlando , FL June 23-25 , 2011 . - The Study Application update amendment reflect follow change : 1 ) inclusion male may enrol Family Group Interview component study &amp; 2 ) inclusion old individual woman may wish include male old member family Family Group Interview portion study . To reflect change maximum age study participant increase 100 year age males longer list exclude study . Objectives : - For follow-up previous study : -- Conduct follow-up telephone interview participant newly-tested time original data collection increase understand mutation-positive experience longitudinally . - For 25 &amp; Under study : - Conduct two ( 2 ) focus group session Joining FORCES Annual Conference , focus unique genetic counseling support need woman consider undergo genetic testing BRCA1/2 prior age 25 . Eligibility : - For follow-up previous study : -- Individuals process make decision relative status mutation positive time previous interview re-interviewed , order learn longitudinal experience expand data set . - For 25 &amp; Under study : - Women age 18-24 receive positive BRCA1/2 mutation test result . - Women age 25-30 consider complete genetic testing BRCA1/2 prior 25th birthday - English-speaking - Attending 2011 Joining FORCES Annual Conference . Design : - For follow-up previous study : - Individuals invite participate second telephone interview , ask describe mutation-related experience since previous interview ( approximately two year ago ) . - Questions participant specifically tailor base previous interview data . Telephone interview anticipate approximately 60 minute length . - **Note : In case individual eligible follow-up also participate multi-generational family interview ( see Amendment A ) , individual interview conduct part study take place follow-up telephone interview . - For 25 &amp; Under Study - Individuals meet eligibility criterion invite participate either two focus group session hold FORCE conference . - Following conference , participant contact via telephone complete brief family history interview , order provide context data collect focus group . - Focus group conduct use prepared guide ( see attachment ) . - Participants enter raffle session , one participant session win $ 50 gift card . - Focus group session telephone family history interview audio record ; , transcribe analyze use modify grounded theoretical design QSR NVivo v8 software .</detailed_description>
