	<detailed_description>Background Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) common inflammatory rheumatic disease prevalence 0.5-1.0 % . Men commonly affect disease compare woman , ratio 2.6-4:1 . Pain back frequent symptom debut . This pain often associate sacroilitis . In late stage also lumbar , thoracic cervical spine hit disease . Peripheral joint , eye , heart , lung urinary tract may also influence . Osteoporosis AS In AS risk osteoporosis increase . However , field yet significantly study probably due several reason predominance men disease men seldom investigate osteoporosis compare woman . When AS progress syndesmophytes spine developed make difficult assess bone mineral density ( BMD ) correctly conventional method , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . Fractures spine easy foreseen since pain patient might misjudge relate increased disease activity . Fractures also overlook radiograph AS . AS associate increase bone formation increase bone resorption . The bone remodel process spine render spine less flexible stiffer consequence also quite small trauma may result fracture . These fracture often instable risk injure spinal cord nerve . Aims study - To investigate prevalence osteoporosis osteoporosis related fracture patient AS Western Sweden . - To identify risk factor osteoporosis osteoporosis related fracture AS . - To study fracture spine may influence pain back , flexibility spine posture patient . - To study extent patient AS investigated treated osteoporosis . - To investigate method reliable measure BMD AS . Design methods This observational study consist questionnaire , examination patient , blood test , measure BMD different technique , DXA , frontal-dorsal lateral projection , Quantitative Computed Tomography ( QCT ) Xtreme CT . Patients AS three rheumatology clinic western Sweden definite AS invited participate . It estimate 250 patient include trial . All patient give inform write consent accord Declaration Helsinki . The study approve Regional Ethics Committee .</detailed_description>
