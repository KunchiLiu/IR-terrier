	<brief_summary>Obesity national epidemic multiple cause complex solution . Research animal human suggest inclusion dairy food moderate calorie restrict diet increase weight loss fat loss . Our propose project extend prior finding determine , first time , inclusion dairy calorie-restricted diet change amount visceral adiposity overweight obese subject . The investigator also propose unique study evaluate potential mechanism ( ) dairy promotes weight fat loss dieting , examination adipocyte size , gene expression , inflammatory marker . The hypothesis investigation ( 1 ) inclusion dairy food modest energy restrict diet significantly increase body fat loss compare control diet ; ( 2 ) dairy product modest energy restrict diet result great fat loss intra-abdominal adipose tissue compare control , 3 ) component dairy product up- down-regulate secretion metabolically-relevant hormone postprandial inter-meal period , 4 ) dairy product promote satiety and/or satiation , 5 ) dairy food reduce adipocyte differentiation and/or enhance adipocyte apoptosis , lead concomitant white adipose tissue ( WAT ) expression change gene play role process , 6 ) dairy food reduce adipocyte lipid storage enhance pathway associate thermogenesis mitochondrial function WAT , reflect gene expression change reduce adipocyte size , 7 ) dairy food include modest energy restrict diet decrease inflammation WAT tissue , thus decrease circulate cytokine , increase zinc status , decrease expression inflammatory marker WAT , reduce WAT macrophage infiltration .</brief_summary>
