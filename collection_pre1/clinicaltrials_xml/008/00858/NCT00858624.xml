	<brief_summary>A cough last 2 month know chronic cough , affect 12-23 % adult non-smoking population . Chronic cough many associated complication include incontinence , muscular chest pain , blackout depression . Current treatment often ineffective patient . To develop new medication investigator need understand mechanism lead excessive coughing . This study plan compare group 12 healthy volunteer 12 patient chronic cough . The investigator hypothesise chronic cough patient sensitive cough reflex result central nervous system hyper-excitability ( central sensitisation ) . The investigator measure cough reflex sensitivity administration ketamine , medication block important receptor central nervous system .</brief_summary>
