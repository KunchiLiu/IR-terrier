	<detailed_description>The PRIMARY goal study investigate association perilipin gene polymorphism , obese subject `` resistant '' weight loss define program . The SECONDARY goal study investigate additional candidate obesity gene previously associate obesity energy metabolism show association resistance weight loss subject energy restrict diet . Additionally , would like investigate metabolic syndrome parameter , dyslipidemia abnormal fast glucose associate perilipin variation obesity-related gene .</detailed_description>
