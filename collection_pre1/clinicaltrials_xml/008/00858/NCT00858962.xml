	<brief_summary>The main purpose protocol study effect HIV medication know Raltegravir Buprenorphine people receive dose Buprenorphine least 3 week study entry . This determine give Raltegravir along Buprenorphine measure amount Raltegravir Buprenorphine blood . The investigator also learn effect Buprenorphine Raltegravir safety take two medication together .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Buprenorphine/Raltegravir Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large number people infect HIV acquire injection drug use . Some people currently treat Buprenorphine addiction medication HIV infection . Raltegravir medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment HIV infection . Raltegravir act make difficult virus cause AIDS multiply cause damage immune system someone HIV infect . Earlier study look effect Buprenorphine HIV medication show Buprenorphine HIV medication act differently take together . It important learn take Buprenorphine HIV medication together result change blood level either medication . If HIV medication affect level Buprenorphine blood , individual take Buprenorphine HIV medication may experience symptom withdrawal , even take usual dose Buprenorphine . On hand , Buprenorphine decrease amount HIV medication blood , HIV medication may less effective control HIV infection . It therefore important learn Raltegravir Buprenorphine affect take together . In order learn effect Buprenorphine Raltegravir , need measure amount Buprenorphine blood 24 hour take Raltegravir compare amount Buprenorphine blood take Buprenorphine Raltegravir together .</detailed_description>
