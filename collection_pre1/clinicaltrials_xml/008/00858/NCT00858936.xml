	<brief_summary>This clinical trial investigate safety effectiveness IK-1001 ( liquid form sodium sulfide ) use Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) patient potentially reduce damage do heart surgery . This study 2 part . Part 1 first test 36 subject different dos ( amount ) study drug . There 6 different group 6 subject receive study drug placebo . A placebo substance prepare look like study drug contain active ingredient . In Part 1 , five subject group receive study drug ( IK-1001 ) one receive placebo . This first part study also dose ( amount ) escalation . This mean group receive different dose study drug . The first group receive low dose , second group receive slightly high dose , third group slightly high dose six group test . You choose group prior start new dose level , data ( information ) previous dose level review group qualify individual determine safe proceed next high dose level . Part 2 expand study treat least 158 ( 632 ) subject dose level deem safe information collect Part 1 . Subjects Part 2 study 1 2 ( 50 % ) chance receive study drug placebo . Whether subject get study drug placebo randomly assign ( like toss coin ) . The study drug placebo give intravenous infusion ( vein ) six hour subject CABG surgery . The subject follow 6 month CABG surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter , dose escalation dose-expansion , study evaluate safety , PK , POC-efficacy IK-1001 subject undergo pump CABG surgery increase risk I/R mediate tissue damage . Study subject undergo plan CABG surgery cardiopulmonary bypass . The study conduct two part . Part 1 study involve dose escalation evaluate safety , PK , preliminary efficacy IK-1001 . Up 36 eligible subject enrol Part 1 portion randomize receive either placebo ( n = 6 ) IK-1001 ( n = 30 ) 6 dose escalating level 0.2 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 1.0 , 1.25 , 1.5 mg/kg/hr infusion 6 hour . The study drug administration begin operate room induction anesthesia prior surgical incision . After safety , efficacy , PK data evaluate Part 1 , optimum dose determine dose expand Part 2 . Initially 158 eligible subject randomize receive either IK-1001 placebo 1:1 ratio . Part 2 aim establish safety , PK well POC efficacy . In event none 4 primary endpoint reach least 15 % decline compare placebo , Sponsor may decide amend protocol explore high dose . After 6 subject dose high dose level , data review Sponsor designee safety PK remain subject enrol . If safety PK data favorable , study complete high dose level .</detailed_description>
