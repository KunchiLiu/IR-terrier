	<brief_title>Using Clonidine Improve Leg Weakness People With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure common condition , affect approximately 5 million people United States . People heart failure encourage exercise lose weight . However , many people heart failure develop weakness leg muscle , make exercise difficult . Increased sympathetic nerve activity , involve nerve carry adrenaline , also occur people heart failure . It possible increase sympathetic nerve activity may actually cause leg muscle weakness . Clonidine , medication use treat high blood pressure , find decrease sympathetic nerve activity . This study examine connection leg weakness sympathetic nerve activity . It also evaluate effectiveness clonidine decrease leg weakness people heart failure . Results study may explain people heart failure unable exercise may help identify way leg strength increase . This study enroll people heart failure . Participants randomly assign wear either clonidine patch placebo patch 3 month . Participants wear patch upper arm , replace patch week . At study visit baseline Month 3 , participant undergo follow procedure : - Sympathetic nerve activity recording , record nerve activity lower leg , use small electrode insert skin - Muscle biopsy , small piece muscle tissue obtain participant ' leg - Heart rate blood pressure measurement - Arterial baroreceptor measurement , nerve body respond change blood pressure examine participant receive different medication increase decrease blood pressure - Echocardiography obtain image heart - Magnetic resonance scan leg - Passive exercise procedure , study researcher conduct arm exercise participant There follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
