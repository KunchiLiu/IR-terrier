	<criteria>Subjects stage IV NSCLC ( recurrent restaged ) . Expected receive least 2 additional cycle ( least 6 total week ) first line myelosuppressive cyclic chemotherapy randomization . Subjects expect receive maintenance chemotherapy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 1 assess within 21 day prior randomization . 18 year age old screening . Life expectancy great 6 month base judgment investigator document screening . Hemoglobin level less equal 11.0 g/dL assess local laboratory ; sample obtain within 7 day prior randomization ( retest screen acceptable ) . Adequate serum folate ( great equal 2 ng/mL ) vitamin B12 ( great equal 200 pg/mL ) level assess central laboratory ( supplementation retest acceptable ) screening . Subjects must baseline scan ( CT , MRI , PET/CT ) chest assess disease burden start first line chemotherapy NSCLC image must review investigator prior randomization . If scan perform 28 day prior randomization , additional scan must perform reviewed investigator confirm patient progress randomization . Before studyspecific procedure , appropriate write informed consent must obtain subject legally accept representative . Known primary benign malignant hematologic disorder cause anemia . History , current active cancer NSCLC , exception curatively resect nonmelanomatous skin cancer , curatively treated cervical carcinoma situ , primary solid tumor curatively treat know active disease present curative treatment administer last 3 year . Received prior adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy NSCLC . Subjects history brain metastasis . Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic BP &gt; 160 mmHg diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg ) , determine investigator screening . History neutralize antibody activity rHuEPO darbepoetin alfa . Uncontrolled angina , uncontrolled heart failure , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia determine investigator screening . Subjects know myocardial infarction within 6 month prior randomization . Subjects history seizure disorder take antiseizure medication within 30 day prior randomization . Clinically significant systemic infection uncontrolled chronic inflammatory disease ( eg , rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease ) determine investigator screening . Known seropositivity HIV diagnosis AIDS , positive hepatitis B surface antigen , seropositive hepatitis C virus History pure red cell aplasia History deep venous thrombosis embolic event ( eg , pulmonary embolism ) within 6 month prior randomization . Transferrin saturation &lt; 20 % ferritin &lt; 50 ng/mL assess central laboratory screening . Subjects must exclude ( supplementation retest acceptable ) . Abnormal renal function ( serum creatinine level &gt; 2X ULN ) assess central laboratory screening . Abnormal liver function ( total bilirubin &gt; 2X ULN liver enzymes ALT AST &gt; 2.5X ULN subject without liver metastasis ≥ 5X ULN subject liver metastasis ) assess central laboratory screening . Subjects document Gilbert 's Disease may eligible . Received RBC transfusion within 28 day prior randomization . Plan receive RBC transfusion randomization study day 1 . Known previous treatment failure ESAs ( eg , rHuEPO , darbepoetin alfa ) . ESA therapy within 28 day prior randomization .
