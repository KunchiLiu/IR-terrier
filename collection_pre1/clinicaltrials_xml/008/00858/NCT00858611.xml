	<brief_summary>Objectives : - To evaluate safety tolerability prime-boost study regimen include recombinant DNA vaccine follow licensed 2008/2009 FluLaval ( Registered Trademark ) adult age 18-50 year adults age 51-70 year compare control group receive license vaccine . - To evaluate whether study participant age group receive prime-boost schedule great frequency H1 H3 neutralize antibody compare age group receive 2008/2009 trivalent influenza vaccine . - To evaluate difference antibody T cell response ( quantity , quality , durability ) two group . Eligibility : - Participants age 18 70 year age available clinic follow-up Week 24 previously undiagnosed clinically significant chronic disease . Participants provide blood sample test determine eligibility . Females must become pregnant study . - Volunteers immunize current season FDA-approved influenza vaccine ( 2008-2009 ) , treat tuberculosis may participate . Design : - The study last 24 week . - Week 0 : The first day Week 0 ( i.e. , Day 0 ) define day enrollment first injection . Specific eligibility review . Participants receive injection either DNA vaccine VRC-FLUDNA047-00-VP ( 4 mg dosage ) placebo . - Week 4 : All study participant receive injection trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine , accord manufacturer 's package insert direction . - Participants give 7-day diary card record temperature symptom ( e.g. , muscle ache , headache , chill , nausea ) injection site reaction ( e.g. , pain , tenderness ) . Participants may also enter information via Internet . Presence symptom may require additional visit clinic . - Participants return clinic 2 week injection follow procedure : - Blood draw test determine immune system 's response vaccine ( ) Clinical evaluation : vital sign weight , examination lymph node , target physical exam visit indicate interim complaint laboratory finding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I , randomize study healthy young ( 18-50 year ) old ( 51-70 year ) adult . For age group , study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity prime-boost vaccination regimen seasonal influenza virus investigational plasmid DNA vaccine prime follow 4 week later seasonal influenza trivalent inactivate vaccine ( TIV ) boost compare seasonal TIV alone . Equal number healthy adult age group receive DNA vaccine first injection control injection phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) first injection . The hypothesis DNA vaccine safe human administration prime-boost schedule elicit high titer antibody response seasonal TIV alone . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability induce antibody titer investigational prime-boost regimen , dose 4 mg DNA vaccine 45 microgram ( ( Micro ) g ) seasonal TIV vaccine . Secondary exploratory objective related humoral cellular immune response . Product Description : The inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine trivalent subunit virion vaccine 2008-2009 season . Each dose compose 45 ( Micro ) g hemagglutinin ( HA ) 0.5 mL ; recommend ratio 15 ( Micro ) g HA follow 3 strain : A/Brisbane/59/2007-like ( H1N1 ) ; A/Brisbane/10/2007-like ( H3N2 ) , A/Uruguay/716/2007 , B/Florida/4/2006-like . The VRC-FLUDNA047-00-VP vaccine develop manufactured VRC , NIAID compose 3 closed-circular DNA plasmid , CMV/R promoter encode 2008-2009 strain H1 , H3 B proteins . DNA vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL dose 1 mL . The placebo DNA vaccine PBS . Vaccination administer intramuscularly ( IM ) deltoid muscle use needle syringe seasonal influenza vaccine Biojector ( Registered Trademark ) 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System ( Biojector ) DNA vaccine ( placebo ) injection . Subjects : A total 80 healthy adult enrol ; 40 18-50 year age group 40 51-70 year age group . Study Plan : There two group study base age . Subjects group randomize one two vaccination schedule . Each age group randomize ratio 1:1 either DNA prime-TIV boost schedule placebo-TIV schedule . Subjects clinicians blinded assignment DNA vaccine placebo first injection subject complete Study Week 8 . All subject receive seasonal influenza TIV vaccine second injection . The initial enrollment group occur faster 4 first week . Before complete enrollment , study pause review Protocol Safety Review Team ( PSRT ) least 1 week safety follow-up initial group 8 subject ' ( 4 group ) first injection . Half subject receive placebo ; therefore time safety review 4 injection investigational DNA vaccine administer . A report provide Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , review study twice per year . The protocol require 6 clinic visit 2 telephone follow-up contact group . This study also include substudy consent process collaboration NIH Clinical Center Department Bioethics . Group 1 ( 18-50 year ) , 40 subject enrol , Group 1A : n=20 Group 1B : n=20 receive DNA IM Biojector Day 0 Flulaval ( Registered Trademark ) IM Needle Day 28 ( plus minus 7 day ) Group 2 ( 51-70 year ) , 40 subject enrol , Group 1A : n=20 Group 2B : n=20 receive DNA IM Biojector Day 0 Flulaval ( Registered Trademark ) IM Needle Day 28 ( plus minus 7 day ) TOTAL : 80 subject ; Day 0 injection blind Day 28 open label . Study Duration : Each participant complete 24 week clinical follow .</detailed_description>
