	<brief_summary>Trastuzumab ( HerceptinÂ® ) increase chance cure patient Her-2 overexpressing early breast cancer . Unfortunately , chemotherapy drug use setting ( anthracyclines ) trastuzumab know cause cardiac dysfunction proportion patient . Patients develop heart problem take trastuzumab might stop treatment , could jeopardise chance cure . N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT pro-BNP ) cardiac biomarker measure blood , level show indicate presence heart failure . Some early research suggest may correlation elevate NT pro-BNP heart damage due cancer chemotherapy also trastuzumab . Troponin another substance measure blood indicate heart damage . Finally , certain variation individual 's genetic makeup ( call polymorphism ) could put increase risk heart damage trastuzumab . Here study whether factor ( NT pro-BNP level , troponin level , certain genetic polymorphism ) accurately predict high risk trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity . The principal aim study evaluate utility NT pro-BNP predictive biomarker development trastuzumab relate cardiotoxicity ( TRC ) . The investigator also examine single nucleotide polymorphism HER2 gene Fc-gamma-receptor gene predict TRC .</brief_summary>
