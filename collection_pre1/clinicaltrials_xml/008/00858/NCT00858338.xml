	<brief_title>Adjuvant Intraperitoneal Floxuridine Added Chemoradiation Fully Resected Advanced Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patient diagnosed stomach cancer US fail cure gastric resection , trial adjuvant chemotherapy improve survival rate . However , show chemo-radiotherapy substantially increase survival rate gastric resection recent intergroup randomize study ( INT 0116 ) use adjuvant chemoradiation 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) leucovorin concurrently total dose 4500 cGy external-beam radiation treatment ( RT ) abdominal tumor nodal field patient resect , locally advanced gastric cancer . However , since common recurrence arm ( surgery vs. surgery follow chemoradiation ) regional , typically abdominal carcinomatosis , may indicate need adjuvant ip floxuridine add adjuvant chemoradiation . Our experience ip floxuridine lead u hypothesize addition type therapy adjuvant chemoradiation may increase cure-rate patient under-going potentially curative gastric resection . It seem important convincingly demonstrate effect ip floxuridine treatment combine chemoradiation regimen . This become basis design Phase II study , test toxicity efficacy ip floxuridine add chemo-radiation INT 0116 study . The protocol complete three year , may become springboard plan initiation pivotal multi-institutional trial .</detailed_description>
