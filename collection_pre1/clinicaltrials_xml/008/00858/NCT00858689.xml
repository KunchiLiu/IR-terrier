	<detailed_description>Fragile X Syndrome ( FXS ) common know inherited form mental impairment also associate range learn disability , neurological problem , seizure , behavioural difficulty . For many individual FXS , behavioral difficulty result severe problem within family community , particularly form agitation , temper outburst , hyperactivity , aggression . These problem often require variety psychopharmacological behavioural approach . Although variety medication helpful FXS target intervention base molecular abnormality study . Defects dendritic spine formation find brain patient Fragile X , suggest structure may represent anatomical physiological basis cognitive deficit associate disorder . Recent research suggest minocycline may specific benefit treatment FXS . Minocycline antibiotic find inhibit activity matrix metallo-proteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , up-regulated hippocampus FMR1 KO ( Fragile X Mental Retardation-1 Knockout ) mouse may responsible immature dendritic spine profile hippocampal neuron . Minocycline recently use treat FXS KO mouse model Fragile X , find rescue abnormal phenotype induce formation mature dendritic spine FMR1 KO hippocampal neuron , vitro vivo . Minocycline treat FXS KO mouse also perform significantly well elevate maze , cognitive performance test measure activity anxiety . Exciting preclinical effect minocycline regard FXS disease model lead pilot proposal , design generate preliminary data could use support large clinical trial . The overall hypothesis minocycline specific molecular target treatment FXS display beneficial effect disruptive behaviour possibly associate feature FXS via reduction MMP-9 activity .</detailed_description>
