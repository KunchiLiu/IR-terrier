	<brief_title>The Role Lipoaspirate Injection Treatment Diabetic Lower Extremity Wounds Venous Stasis Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic low extremity wound venous stasis wound two challenging , costly medical problem population . Moreover , Veterans Affairs population high percentage diabetes venous stasis wound . Foot ulcer common reason diabetic patient admit hospital , occur approx 25 % patient ( CDC ) average stay 3 week cost 25,000 $ / per treatment ( 21,22 , 23 ) . The pathophysiology diabetic wound heal characterized microcirculatory ischemia abnormal wound heal cascade due glycosylated cell protein . Venous stasis disease affect 10-35 % US population ( 24 ) characteristically difficult treat , recurrent costly . The dermal microcirculation aberrant cellular stasis , capillary leak , edema prone chronic wound . As venous pressure increase patient , microcirculatory ischemia predisposes wound formation . In skin , normal wound heal cellular cascade mechanism act restore epithelial component end collagen deposition scar formation . Imperative process angiogenesis , cellular signaling , cellular mitosis . These wound heal process promoted stem cell transplantation . It known lipoaspirate obtain standard small volume liposunction technique contain autologous mesenchymal stem cell . We propose autologous stem cell transplantation via lipoaspirate injection recalcitrant wound could safe effective treatment modality . Because cellular derangement diabetic wound venous stasis wound derive abnormal cell signal , micro-ischemia abnormal capillary , stem cell treatment aid angiogenesis cellular signaling may treatment option aim directly root cause disease . Aim 1 : A prospective , single blind randomized clinical study perform determine injection lipoaspirate diabetic venous stasis wound promote wound heal wound closure faster rate conventional treatment . Rationale : Despite considerable effort , successful heal diabetic low extremity wound venous stasis wound remain difficult therapeutic challenge . We examine whether autologous lipoaspirate injection safe effective treatment option diabetic low extremity wound venous stasis wound . Hypothesis : Injection lipoaspirate subcutaneously around diabetic wound venous stasis wound promote wound heal effectively conventional treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients diabetic low extremity wound venous stasis wound present 6 month whose wound fail heal conventional medical therapy include . Only fully consentable compliant patient already schedule undergo surgical wound treatment wound debridement operating room clinic include . Only patient palpable distal pulse include . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow criterion exclude : HIV + patient patient anticoagulant stop correct patient cellulitis , infection , osteomyelitis , stage III IV ulcer , *those patient safe donor site availability dialysis dependent end stage renal disease . Following normal operate room protocol , anticoagulant aspirin stop prior procedure . Patients randomly choose enter intervention arm control arm study . Even social security number choose undergo treatment arm odd social security number choose undergo control arm . After randomization , control group intervention group analyze ensure statistically significant difference patient profile include : albumin level , hematocrit , smoke status , Hgb A1C value . Both insulin dependent noninsulin dependent diabetic patient include Hgb A1C value use ensure group similar .</criteria>
