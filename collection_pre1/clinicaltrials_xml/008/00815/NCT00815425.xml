	<detailed_description>RA chronic condition cause inflammation joint surround tissue . Symptoms may include pain , stiffness , swell , sometimes destruction joint . RA affect joint , common wrist finger . More woman men get RA , often start age 25 55 . The course severity disease differ significantly person person . Some people RA may disease short time , symptom might come go , severe form RA last lifetime . The purpose study identify genetic factor determine severity RA African Americans . Participants study include African Americans RA healthy African Americans RA . There two arm : ( 1 ) longitudinal ; ( 2 ) cross-sectional . The longitudinal arm complete enrollment still follow-up phase . This consist visit baseline ( less 2 year disease duration ; 3 year disease duration ; 5 year disease duration ) . For cross-sectional arm , one study visit participant , last approximately 1 2 hour participant without RA ( control ) 2 3 hour participant RA . For participant , visit include medical history review ; questionnaires regard health , functional ability , family , education , work history ; blood urine collection . For participant RA , visit also include examination joint pain swell , X-rays hand foot , physical examination . The urine sample store future analysis protein chemical marker . The blood sample use three different way : ( 1 ) isolation DNA ; ( 2 ) isolation serum plasma ; ( 3 ) isolation RNA . Part blood sample use investigator identify gene protein may predispose people develop RA may influence disease outcome treatment response . If participant agree , blood cell put procedure call immortalization , provide researcher sufficient DNA future study associate study related project . If immortalization process fails , participant may ask additional blood sample repeat procedure . However , participant provide information gene .</detailed_description>
