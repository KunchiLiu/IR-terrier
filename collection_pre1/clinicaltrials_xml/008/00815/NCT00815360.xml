	<brief_summary>To investigate role ranibizumab angiographically-directed peripheral scatter laser therapy patient clinically-significant diabetic macular edema ( CSME ) peripheral nonperfusion . We propose novel treatment CSME subgroup patient define combination ultrawide-field angiography ( UWFA ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . Within classification scheme , patient CSME subdivide presence : 1 ) focal macular leakage , 2 ) vitreomacular interface traction , and/or 3 ) peripheral nonperfusion . The successful treatment diabetic macular edema would dictate pathophysiology-directed therapy base classification . The subgroup interest clinical trial characterize diabetic macular edema , peripheral nonperfusion UWFA , absence macular traction OCT . This group patient previously well recognize characterize due limitation previous , standard angiographic evaluation retinal periphery . We postulate subcategory represent one high rate failure accept therapy give persistence basic pathophysiologic mechanism CSME , namely ischemia-induced production Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) retinal periphery . This also represent population patient likely recurrence CSME despite treatment anti-VEGF therapy alone reason .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy lead cause moderate severe visual loss develop country . It paramount socioeconomic impact prevalence diabetes sharply increase , diabetic macular edema lead cause vision loss work age patient , significant cause vision loss patient older 65 year age , frequently affect patient bilaterally , cost therapy increase . Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) common cause vision loss diabetic retinopathy . The pathophysiology DME complex multifactorial . Chronic hyperglycemia , protein kinase C ( PKC ) formation , free radical accumulation , advanced glycation end-product ( AGE ) proteins , ischemia-driven release vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) well understood factor contribute chronic retinal arterial capillary damage increase permeability . The RIDE RISE Studies demonstrate superiority anti-VEGF monotherapy ranibizumab sham therapy , group allow receive macular laser therapy month 3 base predefined criterion . Furthermore , study demonstrate VEGF inhibitor beneficial DME , either monotherapy combination macular laser . The benefit VEGF antagonists treat DME validates VEGF pathway key target . The need repeat anti-VEGF injection maintain benefit treatment beg question whether persistent peripheral retinal ischemia may drive VEGF production least subset patient DME . Fluorescein angiographic study mid- far-periphery diabetic patient Shimizu 1980 's demonstrate area peripheral retinal nonperfusion diabetic patient . These finding reproduce substantiate recently utilize novel , commercially-available imaging system ultrawide-field angiography ( UWFA ) employ scan laser ophthalmoscope ellipsoidal mirror . We investigate whether patient diabetic macular edema associate peripheral nonperfusion UWFA would improve visual acuity , resolution retinal thickening OCT , durability therapy use novel strategy single intravitreal injection Ranibizumab , VEGF-A inhibitor + UWFA-guided peripheral Scatter Laser , RaScaL . A second goal study guide DME treatment image signature UWFA OCT .</detailed_description>
