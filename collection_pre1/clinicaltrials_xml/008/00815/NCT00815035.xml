	<brief_summary>Peanut allergy know cause severe anaphylactic reactions.The goal proposal produce new treatment would benefit subject peanut allergy lower risk anaphylactic reaction ( desensitization ) , change peanut-specific immune response subject peanut allergy ( tolerance ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Immunotherapy ( OIT ) Peanut Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peanut allergy know cause severe anaphylactic reaction . Compared food allergy tend persistent also prevalence seem rise . Currently prove treatment strict avoidance . We attempt decrease risk anaphylaxis accidental ingestion desensitize subject peanut use peanut oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) . We also study effect peanut OIT peanut specific immune response determine tolerance peanut protein develop . Children age one six year age peanut allergy randomize peanut OIT placebo ( active subject ) . Thirty subject also recruit control . These subject receive peanut placebo skin prick test lab work addition history physical exam . Active subject undergo modify rush immunotherapy first day increase dos least every two week maintenance dose 4 gram ( equivalent 13 peanut ) . Doses take daily home except dose increase do research unit . Outcome variables interest include response double-blind placebo control food challenge , skin prick testing , peanut specific IgE , adverse event . These result compare start end peanut OIT use appropriate statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
