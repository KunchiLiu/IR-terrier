	<brief_summary>The aim study examine whether tamoxifen-treated Israeli breast cancer patient CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( CYP2D6*4/*4 genotype ) high cancer relapse risk 2.5-5-year follow-up period initial diagnosis primary treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CYP2D6 Genotyping AmpliChipTM CYP450 Tamoxifen-Treated Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tamoxifen , first-line drug prevent breast cancer relapse , typically prescribed 5-year follow-up period diagnosis primary treatment estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer . Recent study show tamoxifen pro-drug , major active metabolite , endoxifen , form vitro liver enzyme CYP2D6 . Preliminary observation US Italy suggest tamoxifen less efficacious cancer relapse prevention patient deficient CYP2D6 activity . The FDA currently review new data likely modify tamoxifen label accordingly . It suggest aromatase inhibitor drug letrozole might beneficial patient . The propose study would retrospectively test CYP2D6 genotype 200 - 300 estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive breast cancer patient treat tamoxifen post-operatively . Blood collect informed consent would use examine patient CYP2D6 genotype , identify CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( CYP2D6*4/*4 genotype ) , measurement endoxifen blood level woman drug . AmpliChipTM CYP450 microarray chip contain million tiny DNA molecule , provide comprehensive coverage gene variation play role metabolism approximately 25 % prescription drug . The AmpliChipTM CYP450 test intend aid physician individualize treatment dose patient receive therapeutic metabolize enzymes . The clinical data collect would examine individual , well treat CYP2D6 inhibit drug paroxetine fluoxetine , high cancer relapse rate . The study , combine similar finding country , possibly integrate later international network study , would imperative modify treatment recommendation breast cancer therapy . Specifically , US Italian finding confirm , might advisable switch 5-year follow-up treatment breast cancer patient ER positive primary tumor CYP2D6 poor metabolizers tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor drug letrozole .</detailed_description>
