	<brief_summary>Uterine sarcoma account le 5 % carcinomas uterine corpus . The prognosis patient extremely limited . Recurrence rate 50-60 % report even early-stage disease ( FIGO I/II ) . Median overall survival 12 month patient advance metastatic disease . Ovarian carcinosarcoma extremely rare among ovarian malignancy ( &lt; 2 % ) . That insufficient data basis establish gold standard . As result , case tend treated way uterine sarcoma epithelial ovarian malignancy clinical practice . On basis data publish date treatment mixed mesenchymal-epithelial tumor , clear treatment commonly use date limited activity produce clinically relevant toxicity . The regime verify far ( Cisplatin / Ifosfamide , Ifosfamide/Paclitaxel Gemcitabine/Docetaxel ) exhibit considerable side effect spectrum rarely feasible clinical everyday life condition , e. g. rate withdrawal due toxicity study collective select female treat last combination 40 % . The physician check every individual case one mention combination feasible . The search alternative effective well tolerate treatment option essential . The toxicity data carboplatin-PLD combination know , efficacy identify small cohort . The objective study explore efficacy combination PLD-carboplatin treatment large patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Trial With PegLiposomal Doxorubicin Carboplatin Combination Chemotherapy Gynecological Sarcomas Mixed Epithelial-Mesenchymal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study patient mesenchymal mixed epithelial mesenchymal tumor ovary uterus design prospective single-arm , open - label , multicenter phase II study evaluate efficacy PegLiposomal Doxorubicin Carboplatin combination chemotherapy . 40 patient recruit receive PegLiposomal Doxorubicin ( PLD ) continuous i. v. infusion least 60 minute dose 40 mg/m2 Day 1 , follow 30-minute i. v. carboplatin infusion accord AUC 6 ( formula devise Calvert et al ) . Patients get outpatient treatment . At screen patient ' eligibility assess , baseline demographic characteristic obtain , baseline value effect variable collect . Patients measurable lesion , non-measurable lesion histological documentation include trial . Measurable lesion non-measurable lesion document x-ray , ultrasound , compute tomography MRI . The patient ' safety monitor therapy recovery toxicity . In patient measurable lesion baseline , ( post ) -treatment value effect accord RECIST criterion collect show table 6 . CR , PR SD confirm repeat measurement interval least four week . Follow-up schedule every three month first two year end treatment . As year 3 follow-up take place outside study context general aftercare .</detailed_description>
