	<brief_summary>Immersion pulmonary edema ( IPE ) condition fluid fill lungs dive swimming , particularly cold water . Some individual appear predispose develop IPE . DNA sample collect store , order compare genetic profile individual experience IPE . In individual experienced IPE , plan measure effect cold water immersion blood pressure , cardiac output pressure pulmonary artery . These compare similar measurement already obtain normal individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Immersion pulmonary edema ( IPE ) condition sudden onset swimmer diver , characterize cough , shortness breath , decrease blood oxygen level , hemoptysis . The purpose study examine effect cold water immersion dive reflex pulmonary arterial pressure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure already experience IPE , well explore possibility genetic predisposition . Healthy nonsmoking subject experience IPE recruit several cold-water immersion experiment DNA analysis . Their pulmonary arterial pulmonary arterial wedge pressure measure undergo immerse rest exercise trial thermoneutral cold water . If pressure increase trial hypothesize , effect sildenafil administration ( pulmonary vasodilator ) test second trial . Blood also draw DNA analysis certain gene possible relation IPE . Results test compare general population .</detailed_description>
