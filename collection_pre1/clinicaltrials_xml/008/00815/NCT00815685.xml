	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Eicosapentaenoic Acid ( EPA ) Patients With Cancer Cachexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People cancer get call cancer cachexia ( CC ) . The symptom CC include get full quickly eat ( early satiety ) , loss appetite , weakness result weight loss loss lean body mass . Even weight loss 5 % cancer patient reflect poor health , hospitalization , high rate illness . Research show elderly high risk deficiency vitamin trace mineral . Other pre-existing chronic disease drug therapy population may increase need certain nutrient . Recent study also show advanced malnutrition much difficult treat elderly young adult , consequence failure treat delay recovery decrease function quality life . At time , way treat CC include give medication increase appetite give nutritional supplement high calorie protein . Recent study show certain type fat present fish , walnuts food eat call Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) may help weight gain , especially gain muscle improve quality life patient pancreatic cancer . However , EPA never study prevention cancer cachexia cancer patient show early sign weight loss . Based early , small study , clear need study EPA prevent loss muscle weight cancer patient prevent become worse .</detailed_description>
