	<brief_title>Decision Making Unaffected First-Degree Relatives Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 - The purpose part research study conduct individual interview focus group ( group discussion ) learn thing behavior help men stay healthy decision make process prostate cancer screen . We discuss men 's general health concern , knowledge , belief , concern regard prostate cancer screen prostate cancer . We use result study develop decision aid help first-degree relative prostate cancer patient make informed decision whether undergo test undergo test prostate cancer . The new decision aid include digital videodisc ( DVD ) accompany booklet . We hope learn need concern first-degree relative , information include decision aid , language use , best way present information . Phase 2 - The purpose part research study test usefulness acceptability new decision aid develop specifically first-degree relative ( FDRs ) prostate cancer patient . We compare new decision aid another widely available decision aid develop specifically first-degree relative . The goal see new decision aid change knowledge ( prostate cancer screen ) increase satisfaction decision making ( intention decision make ) . If find evidence new decision aid relevant ( useful ) acceptable , large study several hundred men determine definitively whether new decision aid well already exist general decision material men work best . Because correct decision ( whether undergo screen undergo screening ) know time , goal decision aid present ( balanced manner ) potential harm benefit screen . Therefore , study focus inform decision making ( knowledge satisfaction decision ) .</detailed_description>
