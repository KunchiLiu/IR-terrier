	<brief_summary>This extension ongoing clinical trial use ex vivo expand autologous Cytokine-induced killer ( CIK ) cell adoptive cellular immunotherapy haematological malignancy . The pre-existing clinical trial target patient acute myeloid leukemia MDS , relapse disease post allogeneic transplant . Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) disease good response kinase inhibitor . There however patient transform phase disease respond treatment . A small proportion patient response Imatinib may develop mutation result drug resistance . In addition , vast majority patient good response kinase inhibitor still persistent CML cell detectable molecular level . It known CML progenitor sensitive kinase inhibitor . On hand , immune mediate mechanism know able eradicate CML show efficacy donor lymphocyte infusion allogeneic transplant setting . Early clinical trial show clearance bcr-abl use peptide vaccination . There also convince mouse data show eradication CML molecular level autologous CIK cell , clinical trial do use CIK cell CML . We therefore plan expand current CIK trial include CML disease , CML patient various degree response kinase inhibitor already offer maximal effect . We aim study whether autologous CIK cell may improve disease response , either eradiation minimal residual disease , conjunction chemotherapy control high tumour load disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Cytokine Induced Killer Cells ( CIK ) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML ) Patients Standard Drug Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients CML fall various group base disease stage response kinase inhibitor . In context currently available kinase inhibitor , allogeneic transplant various available new drug trial , still patient achieve satisfactory sustainable response . For patient , aim employ CIK cell immunotherapeutic modality concurrent original CML-specific therapy . This enable u explore additional activity CIK cell CML without compromise ongoing , establish treatment . The following group patient potential candidate : 1 . Blast crisis / accelerate phase patient fail response kinase inhibitor fit undergo induction chemotherapy acute leukemia . Repeated cycle CIK give phase plan chemotherapy cycle , observe achievement remission durability . 2 . Blast crisis / accelerate phase patient achieve haematological cytogenetic response kinase inhibitor , definitive curative option eg allogeneic transplant . In absence long term data Dasatinib Nilotinib , justifiable study efficacy addition CIK therapy baseline best response achievable drug therapy . 3 . Patients resistance currently available kinase inhibitor due T315I mutation undefined mutation , progressive relapse either molecular , cytogenetic haematological level , transplant curative option . In group patient additional CIK current treatment show activity CIK drug-resistant mutant CML cell . 4 . Patients achieve stable residual molecular evidence CML , willing explore additional mean hope eradication MRD . Since role immunotherapy relevant MRD , CIK infusion provide proof principal observation whether imatinib-resistant CML Philadelphia stem cell eradicate ex vivo activate expanded cytotoxic T cell .</detailed_description>
