	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) important cause morbidity occasional mortality congenitally infected infant immuno-compromised child adult , especially human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected individual transplant recipient . Newborn infant represent particularly high-risk group . This study cell-mediated immune response cytomegalovirus GB/MF59 vaccine substudy Division Microbiology Infectious Diseases , NIAID , NIH , DHHS ( DMID ) protocol 04-039 , `` A Randomized , Double-Blind , Placebo-Controlled , Phase II Study Assess Safety Efficacy Cytomegalovirus gB/MF59 Vaccine Preventing Systemic Cytomegalovirus Infection Healthy Adolescent Females . '' This vaccine trial design test safety efficacy CMV gB/MF59 vaccine . Primary goal study ass whether injection 3 dos CMV gB/MF59 vaccine induces significant CD4+ , CD8+ and/or regulatory T cell immune response ; evaluate boost affect gB/MF59 CMV-specific T cell responses 3 dos vaccine ; evaluate persistence CMV-specific T cell response vaccination ; evaluate CMV-specific T cell response subject seroconvert vaccine trial . New technique enumeration characterization antigen specific T cell available facilitate precise analysis magnitude functional capacity influenza virus-specific T cell . All subject enrol CMV gB/MF59 trial Vanderbilt Cincinnati study site eligible enrollment cell-mediated immune response sub-study . Blood draws assessment cellular immune response obtain 3 phase . Phase 1 , N=50 : visit 1 , initial 100 consented subject recruit approximately 50 seropositive subject ( base 60 percent seropositive rate ) . Samples phase study use establish optimal condition assay compare natural infection vaccine induce T cell response . Phase 2 , N=50-100 : day 0 ( 1st dose vaccine ) , day 30 ( second dose vaccine ) , day 60 ( 1 month second dose vaccine ) , day 210 ( 1 month last dose vaccine ) , day 390 ( 7 month last dose vaccine ) . Samples phase use evaluate boosting affect gB/MF59 3 dos vaccine evaluate persistence CMV-specific T cell response . Phase 3 : visit ( S1-S8 ) subject seroconvert ( i.e . subject seroconverts visit 10 blood obtain visit S1-S8 ) . These sample use compare CMV-specific response subject either receive vaccine seroconvert study . These time point base vaccine study design previous work evaluate T cell response vaccination 1 month 6 month immunization . Researchers collect 30 ml blood per draw trial enrol 100 healthy adolescent females 12-17 year age , inclusive . Blood volume determine ensure sufficient number cell establish stimulation protocol evaluate cell-mediated immune response . The study duration 43 month . Subject duration 31 month , unless subject seroconverts enroll shed study . This study link DMID protocol 04-039 .</detailed_description>
