	<brief_summary>In Netherlands , human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccination add National Vaccination Program girl protect development cervical cancer . The vaccine protect HPV type 16 &amp; 18 , cause 75 % cervical cancer . Studies show vaccine effective healthy subject prevent infection HPV 16 &amp; 18 . However , evidence exists immunogenicity safety HPV vaccination patient immune system disorder , primary humoral immunodeficiency ( i.e . hypogammaglobulinemia ) autoimmune disease . Concerns exist vaccination may cause aggravation underlie disease . In addition , immune response vaccination may diminish due immunosuppressive therapy underlie disease . Objective : The primary goal current study study immunogenicity HPV vaccination patient autoimmune disease primary humoral immunodeficiency . Based retrospective analysis vaccine hypothesize patient autoimmune disease immunosuppressive medication patient immune system disorder decrease serological response HPV vaccination , produce HPV antibody titer decrease rapidly healthy individual . The secondary objective explore safety HPV vaccination immune regulatory mechanism induce vaccination subset patient . The investigator hypothesize HPV vaccination safe HPV-induced regulatory T cell able prevent increase activity autoimmune disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : prospective observational cohort study . Study population : Females age 12 - 18 year one autoimmune diseases Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ( JIA ) , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) Juvenile Dermatomyositis ( JDM ) include . Included female treat rheumatology unit University Medical Center Utrecht . A small control group healthy girl age 13 -17 year also include compare kinetics HPV serology healthy individual . Intervention : Starting September 2009 girl age 12 year offer HPV vaccination via National Vaccination Program . Prior , national campaign start March 2009 vaccinate girl age 13-17 year once.We use national vaccination campaign opportunity analyze serological response safety vaccine large group immune system disorder . The vaccine administer national health organisation . The effect monitor clinic . Main study parameters/endpoints : - Primary outcome immunogenicity measure antibody level HPV serotype 16 &amp; 18 time . We consider HPV vaccination immunogenic antibody titer cutoffs 20 24 mMU/ml HPV 16 18 , respectively ; â‰¥2 fold increase antibody level serotypes . The antibody level measure prior vaccination , 3,7 12 month . - The secondary outcome safety vaccination , measure activity underlie autoimmune disease . In addition , frequency common adverse effect , immunological change induce HPV vaccination , number function cytotoxic T cell Tregs describe . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Burden : included patient ask visit hospital 4 time period 12 month . During visit , physical examination perform blood obtain serological immunological analysis . Most visit combine routine follow-up venous puncture patient . However , one extra visit hospital vena puncture expect . 5 ml ( extra ) blood obtain four time patient serological analysis . Included healthy control ask visit one plenary information meeting evening . Controls venous puncture four time study , 5 ml blood obtain . These sample obtain hospital evening clinic school . In subset patient ( n=50 ) healthy control ( n=10 ) , additional 15 ml obtain immunological analysis . Risks : participant may experience adverse event HPV vaccination . Benefits : Protection human Papillomavirus infection therefore reduce risk cervix carcinoma , certainty protection HPV 16 &amp; 18 safety HPV vaccination . Group relatedness : This study do patient need vaccination ( i.e . female age group 12-24 year ) immune system disorder , JIA , SLE JDM . Appropriate comparison healthy control must perform age-matched healthy female also recruit National HPV vaccination campaign , case girl age group 13-17 year .</detailed_description>
