	<brief_summary>The clinically widely use X-ray compute tomography examination low-grade radiation effect recently attract much attention concern possible adverse effect radiation human body [ ref . 1-5 ] . The radiation harmful human tissue cell mainly interact water ( make 80 % cell ) generate reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , especially formation hydroxyl radical . So far reach , report concern relation X-ray compute tomography examination blood ROS level . Therefore , wish conduct study clarify cardiac compute tomography angiography ( cardiac CTA ) may induce high level ROS peripheral blood . Study subject OPD patient arrange cardiac CTA examination suspect coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . In total , twenty case enrol study . The formal consent deliver explain patient family arrangement cardiac CTA . It retrieve performance cardiac CTA . For enrolled case , peripheral blood sample three time ( twice performance cardiac CTA ) . Totally 60 blood sample collect 20 study subject within 3 month ( January 1 ~ March 31 , 2009 ) . ROS level collect blood sample measure , compare , analyze .</brief_summary>
