	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Alefacept Treatment Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris ( PRP ) therapeutic challenge , many different medication regimen exist treat condition . Clinical response variable , single treatment emerge leading therapy . Biologic agent emerge effective treatment many skin disease , include psoriasis . Given clinical overlap PRP psoriasis , logical attempt use agent PRP . Since majority patient PRP unresponsive current therapy , new treatment modality must evaluate . This study evaluate treatment adult 30 year old diagnosis PRP , either subtypes 1 2 . In study , safety efficacy alefacept evaluated adult patient PRP refractory current treatment . Alefacept dimeric fusion protein contain CD2 extracellular bind region human leukocyte function antigen-3 ( LFA-3 ) link Fc portion human IgG1 . The drug bind T-lymphocyte antigen CD2 block interaction LFA-3 antigen present cell body . The CD2/LFA-3 interaction key co-stimulatory signal activation T-lymphocytes central pathophysiology psoriasis . It theorize interaction play role pathophysiology PRP . Alefacept currently approve treatment adult moderate severe , chronic , plaque-type psoriasis . The medication administer weekly intramuscular injection 12 week course . In study , dose 15mg alefacept administer intramuscularly weekly interval 12 week . This dose regimen currently approve treatment psoriasis . Patients follow total 24 week .</detailed_description>
