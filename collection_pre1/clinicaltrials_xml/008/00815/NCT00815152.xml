Data Analysis Risk/Safety Issues : With 10 subject per group statistical power direct hypothesis test . Nevertheless , p-values present analysis ( chi-square test , t-tests , Spearman correlation ) simply aid interpretation result . In way p-values use declare statistical significance non-significance test result . Accordingly , primary focus mean , variance , covariance study endpoint , well change score endpoint across study intervention 95 % confidence limit .</brief_summary>
