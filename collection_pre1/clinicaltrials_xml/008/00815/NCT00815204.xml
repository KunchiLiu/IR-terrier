	<brief_summary>Approximately , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) occur 8 % adult population time . Exposure traumatic event increase risk poor physical health often lead disability . The biology PTSD continually explore order help find good treatment debilitate disorder . In study , propose understanding PTSD . Prior research find patient PTSD change stress hormone pathway . In pathway , release certain hormone pituitary gland brain feed blood stream tell adrenal gland produce stress hormone . The pituitary gland locate base brain control hormone body , include stress hormone . Research psychiatric disorder find change pituitary volume along change hormone . This investigated yet PTSD . Therefore , propose study measure pituitary volume people PTSD look change stress hormone pathway . Moreover , investigate whether hormone affect PTSD . In way , understand biology PTSD help develop new therapy intervene hormonal system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lifetime prevalence post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) estimate 8 % . Exposure traumatic event increase risk poor physical health , chronic PTSD often lead disability . The pathophysiology PTSD continually explore order help find well treatment modality debilitate disorder . Proposed mechanism alter stress axis PTSD include change level pituitary . Though pituitary stress hormone axis explore , work do evaluate change pituitary volume response change stress axis PTSD . We design study ass difference pituitary volume . We compare volumes patient PTSD , non-PTSD subject history trauma , healthy control . We test HPA axis dexamethasone/CRH test , standardize diagnostic test , correlate finding change pituitary volume . Moreover , assess change endocrine axes protein . We propose understand PTSD establish direct link structure function . By establish link structure function , novel therapy intervene endocrine system may prove benefit treating PTSD</detailed_description>
