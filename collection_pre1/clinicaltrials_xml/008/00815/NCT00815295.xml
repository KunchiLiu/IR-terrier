	<brief_title>Study Sorafenib/Cetuximab Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized phase I B/II trial enrol 43 patient recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN candidate surgical salvage definitive radiation . Subjects receive Cetuximab sorafenib disease progression . Cetuximab give standard approve dose : 400 mg/m2 load dose follow 250 mg/m2 weekly . Sorafenib give 200 mg twice daily oral , continuous dose 6 patient cohort 1 . If less 3 patient experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) 200mg BID dose , 6 patient accrued 400mg BID dose level toxicity examine . Sorafenib give 400 mg twice daily oral , continuous dose patient cohort 2 . One cycle equal 28 day . Tumor assessment perform every 8 week . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable side effect . Participating subject ask take part optional correlative study provide previously archive diagnostic therapeutic tumor sample obtain course routine medical care cancer head/neck . The optional tissue repository project Duke University Health System ( DUHS ) Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve ( eIRB # 11138 / `` Tissue Acquisition Protocol Analysis Effects Novel Chemotherapeutic Compounds ) . Subjects ask sign separate consent form participate tissue collection study .</detailed_description>
