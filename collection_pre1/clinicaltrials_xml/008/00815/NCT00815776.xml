	<brief_title>Treatment Outcomes Temporomandibular Disorders ( TMD ) Via Clayton Intra-aural Device ( CID ) Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After provide consent , subject assess whether meet inclusion criterion study . Subjects complete 4 week diary measure TMD symptom record pain level Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) twice daily . Standardized Research Diagnostic Criteria ( RDC ) use classify type TMDs . The formal assessment tool know RDC/TMD . It empirically-based operationalized system diagnose classify RDC/TMD use biopsychosocial model disease framework . The CMI/TMD ( hereafter refer CMI ) design provide basis evaluate severity TMD sign symptom . The CMI score calculate dysfunction index ( DI ) palpation index ( PI ) . The majority question find CMI also include RDC/TMD , exception five question . As part baseline medical history , subject ask five question include RDC/TMD include CMI . Data CMI five RDC/TMD question combine database score accord score guideline RDC/TMD order diagnose classify TMDs study subject . Subjects may categorize one three diagnostic group , include muscle disorder ( myofascial pain ) , arthralgia , disc displacement reduction . Subjects examination use CMI screen visit . Subjects meet inclusion criterion randomize one three group : The study device ( Clayton Intra-aural Device ( CID ) ) group , mouth splint group , exercise group . Subjects group return clinic baseline visit , follow visit one month , two month three month post-baseline return complete 4 week VAS diary complete follow-up testing . At baseline visit , subject target physical examination , result document investigator CMI questionnaire . Subjects complete in-office VAS score , Modified SSI questionnaire , also complete TMJ Scale , questionnaire design measure possible improvement use 10 point scale . At follow-up visit , subject complete questionnaire ( include Modified SSI questionnaire in-office VAS score ) target physical examination , result document investigator CMI questionnaire . At follow-up visit , subject issue new monthly diary complete VAS score twice daily , ( morning 10:00 a.m. bed ) well track device wear time exercise compliance , applicable . At three month follow-up visit , subject also complete TMJ Scale . Adverse event assess visit .</detailed_description>
