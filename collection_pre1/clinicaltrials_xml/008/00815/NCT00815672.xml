	<detailed_description>Numerous study show vast majority patient experience cancer-related fatigue ( CRF ) cancer treatment . Research group show 71 % percent 84 prostate cancer patient report CRF radiation . Unlike fatigue cause overexertion , CRF pervasive , whole-body experience alleviate rest sleep often linger long complete standard treatment like radiation therapy . It detrimental effect patient ' quality life interfere completion prescribe treatment regimen . In addition , last fatigue many patient impedes resumption normal life follow treatment . Unfortunately , effective , well-accepted treatment CRF lack . Although research suggest exercise may promise intervention reduce CRF , physician still hesitant prescribe exercise fatigue patient , , fact , often encourage rest conserve energy , may exact opposition need . One probable peripheral physiological mechanism may affect influence CRF loss skeletal muscle mass , , ultimately , effect weakness strength . This muscle loss result deconditioning effect stem reduced physical activity result cancer treatment . It plausible patient may enter radiation therapy certain degree muscle loss , reduce strength substantially decrease level physical activity result cancer diagnosis associate stress , surgical systemic treatment , and/or subsequent symptomology . Additionally , physical activity may decline even radiation escalate loss muscle decrease strength . Recently , researcher propose deconditioning response , well generalized inflammatory response result cancer and/or treatment result skeletal muscle loss strength deficit , may play significant role etiology CRF . Although mild exercise counteract deconditioning , current research show cancer patient decrease amount physical activity engage diagnosis well treatment . Additionally , substantial number patient never return prediagnosis level physical exercise meet minimal ACSM CDC guideline achieve health-related benefit ( e.g. , increased muscle mass , strength , cardiorespiratory fitness ) think etiologically involved CRF , suggest need formal intervention . We propose test individually tailored physical exercise intervention , include aerobic resistance exercise , reduce CRF prostate cancer patient receive radiation therapy . The propose research provide detail information efficacy acceptance home-based aerobic resistance exercise program CRF among prostate cancer patient receive radiation . Data regard influence intervention potential factor related CRF , include loss strength , muscle atrophy inflammatory biomarkers gather . The purpose propose study extend positive finding feasibility study show tailor home-based aerobic ( walk ) progressive resistance exercise program effective reduce CRF improve strength , skeletal muscle mass , aerobic capacity quality life small sample prostate breast cancer patient ( N=38 ) . The Primary Aim study examine influence home-based aerobic progressive resistance exercise program CRF prostate cancer patient receive radiation therapy . The propose study phase II randomize , 2-arm , control clinical trial employ repeated-measures design ( baseline , post intervention , 3-month follow-up ) accrue 122 male prostate cancer patient receive radiation therapy . This project build upon promise pilot data include diverse research team substantial experience exercise intervention , survivorship , cancer control research . This grant allow u discern efficacy novel , tailor , home-based aerobic resistance exercise intervention reduce CRF among prostate cancer patient radiation , identify potential factor ( e.g. , loss strength , muscle atrophy , dysregulation bodily immune function } may contribute development CRF , turn , effectively target tailoring future exercise intervention improve impact exercise intervention reduce CRF . These result direct potential reduce suffer experienced prostate cancer patient radiation treatment , positively impact future research exercise cancer control side effect management , practice evidence-based medicine treatment CRF , , eventually , public health policy oncology practice .</detailed_description>
