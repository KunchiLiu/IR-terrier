	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine effectiveness bortezomib ( Velcade ) plus prednisone treating chronic graft versus host disease ( cGVHD ) safety drug combination patient population . Chronic GVHD medical condition may occur allogeneic stem cell transplantation . The donor 's immune system may recognize participant body ( host ) foreign attempt `` reject '' . Bortezomib use research study , information study suggest drug may help control abnormal immune response underlie cGVHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Plus Prednisone Initial Therapy Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Each treatment cycle last five week , time participant come clinic receive bortezomib intravenously week first 4 week . Prednisone take orally daily basis dose reduction may initiate 1 cycle therapy . - During treatment cycle , participant follow : physical exam blood work . At end cycle 3 ( week 15 ) participant cGVHD evaluate . These assessment may include eye examination , skin examination , pulmonary function test and/or , flexion assessment test . - Participants receive 3 cycle bortezomib .</detailed_description>
