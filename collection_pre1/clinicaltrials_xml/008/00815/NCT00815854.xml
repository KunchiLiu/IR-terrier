	<brief_title>Examining Risk Factors Atypical Antipsychotic Metabolic Side Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antipsychotic medication use treat severe symptom mental illness , hallucination irrational outburst . Atypical antipsychotic ( AAPs ) group new , second generation antipsychotic medication effectively treat psychotic symptom also severe side effect . One side effect increase risk metabolic syndrome , cluster condition together increase risk heart disease , stroke , type 2 diabetes , endothelial dysfunction—dysfunction cell line inner surface blood cell . Schizophrenic patient take atypical antipsychotic twice likely general population experience metabolic syndrome . Certain genetic variant associate folate metabolism , well low dietary folate , may lead development metabolic syndrome associate disease . These factor study general population , group schizophrenic patient take antipsychotic . This study examine relationship among folic acid , variant gene methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase , metabolic syndrome associate disease people schizophrenia take atypical antipsychotic . The study also evaluate use folic acid supplementation treat metabolic syndrome population . Participation study involve two phase . The first phase involve recruitment , screening , test participant take antipsychotic last 4 year . During phase , participant attend one study visit undergo screen metabolic syndrome follow measure : endothelial functioning , body size , diet , physical activity , medication history , genetic makeup . Participants metabolic syndrome invited participate Phase 2 . Phase 2 run concurrently Phase 1 , extend 5 year , order give participant opportunity continue one phase next meet entry criterion . Participants Phase 2 attend four study visit course 3 month : one begin phase one month study . After first study visit , participant give folic acid take daily 3 month . At study visit , participant ask thought , illness , functioning , diet , medication side effect , recent medication history , smoke history , alcohol intake , exercise habit . On first last visit , participant undergo additional test genetics , blood hormone level , blood vessel functioning , additional measurement make height , weight , vital sign , body size . The Phase 2 study inactive . Phase 2B active currently recruit participant . This randomized , placebo control study folate supplementation . Participants phase 2B attend 6 study visit course 6 month . At first study visit randomize either folic acid 5mg daily 4 month placebo . This 4 month period follow 2 month follow visit , supplementation give . At study visit , participant ask thought , illness , functioning , diet , medication side effect , recent medication history , smoke history , alcohol intake , exercise habit . On first last visit , participant undergo additional test genetics , blood hormone level , blood vessel functioning , additional measurement make height , weight , vital sign , body size .</detailed_description>
