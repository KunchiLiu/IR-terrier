	<brief_summary>Background : - Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection necessary development cervical cancer . Worldwide , infection HPV type 16 18 account approximately 70 percent cervical cancer case . Available data suggest prophylactic vaccination HPV type 16 18 nearly 100 percent effective preventing persistent cervical infection resultant disease type least 5 year follow vaccination . This study extension 2004 study 7,466 woman Costa Rica randomize vaccinate control group . The study describe proposes extend follow-up woman recruit trial vaccinate HPV-16/18 vaccine start CVT additional 6 year , total 10 year follow-up . We expect provide HPV-16/18 vaccine woman control arm trial initial 4 year follow-up complete , propose follow additional period well . We also enroll follow new group approximately 3000 woman follow state-of-the-art screening serve unvaccinated control group ( UCG ) extend follow-up period . Objectives : - To evaluate 10-year global impact HPV-16/18 vaccination young adult woman . - To evaluate determinant immune response HPV vaccine marker long-term protection . - To evaluate natural history HPV cervical disease vaccinate unvaccinated population . Eligibility : - Participants original 2004 study live Guanacaste province area Puntarenas close Guanacaste eligible LTFU study . Women receive HPV-16/18 vaccine start CVT invite 6 year additional follow-up , woman originally control arm CVT offer HPV-16/18 vaccine crossover also invite additional follow-up . Newly recruit control ( 3,000 ) match participant original study . Women original study bear July 1978 November 1987 , live Guanacaste nearby Puntarenas province , history cervical cancer hysterectomy . Design : - At enrollment , newly recruit control receive extensive screening treatment cervical neoplasia . - All woman ( vaccinated control ) follow 2-year interval 6 year . Questionnaire data collect . Pelvic examination perform visit . Cervical secretion cell collect . Women evidence cervical abnormality accelerate screen refer colposcopy evaluation treatment need . - A subset woman extra clinic visit extra blood saliva sample collect allow study immune response vaccine disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection necessary development cervical cancer . Worldwide , infection HPV type 16 18 account approximately 70 % cervical cancer case . Currently available data suggest prophylactic vaccination HPV types-16 18 nearly 100 % effective preventing persistent cervical infection resultant disease type least five year follow vaccination . Intramural NCI group Costa Rican investigator long-time involvement study elucidate natural history HPV cervical cancer , development prophylactic HPV vaccine . In 2004 , initiate community-based randomized clinical trial Costa Rica evaluate safety efficacy bivalent virus-like particle HPV-16/18 vaccine . The study successfully randomize 7,466 woman ; active follow-up woman underway plan 4 year . Herein , propose extend follow-up woman recruit trial vaccinate HPV- 16/18 vaccine start CVT additional 6 year , total 10 year follow-up . We expect provide HPV-16/18 vaccine woman control arm trial initial 4 year follow-up complete , propose follow additional 2 year , monitor vaccine safety maximize detection persistent infection lesion resultant HPV exposure occur cross-over HPV vaccination ( subset woman follow entire 10 year ) . We also enroll follow new group approximately 3000 woman follow state-of-the-art screening serve unvaccinated control group ( UCG ) extend follow-up period . Women screen two year interval . Women evidence cervical abnormality accelerate screen refer colposcopy evaluation treatment need . Questionnaires biological specimen collect follow-up period allow many unique scientific woman 's health question address . There three overarch objective effort . They follow : 1 . To evaluate 10-year global impact HPV-16/18 vaccination young adult woman ; 2 . To evaluate determinant immune response HPV vaccine , marker long-term protection ; , 3 . To evaluate natural history HPV cervical disease vaccinate unvaccinated population . This research provide invaluable data allow continued investigation risk benefit prophylactic HPV vaccine .</detailed_description>
