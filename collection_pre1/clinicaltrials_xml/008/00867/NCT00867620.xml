	<brief_summary>Bladder cancer rank ninth worldwide cancer incidence . Approximate 90 % bladder cancer malignancy urothelium tissue , urothelial cancer ( UC ) . The mortality bladder cancer mainly due recurrence metastasis . Unfortunately , currently available cytology cystoscopy examination limit value low sensitivity early disease . New biomarkers well detection technology thus require improve early diagnosis . By aid quantitative methylation-specific PCR ( QMSP ) , allow detect tumor-derived DNA tissue body fluid , DNA methylation-based assay thus develop early detection prognosis . The goal propose project develop panel DNA-methylation base biomarkers UC diagnosis , prognosis , prediction response therapy ( especially recurrence , invasion , survival , responses therapeutic agent ) . Although numerous study investigate aberrant promoter hypermethylation bladder cancer UC , inconsistent result observe . DNA hypermethylation determination may rely condition QMSP , also biopsy specimen different race , environmental expose factor , regional variation . We thus need profile DNA methylation pattern UC patient Taiwan establish panel potential prediction biomarkers local patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Non-Invasive DNA Methylation-Based Assay System Risk Assessment Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , technology genomics , expression analysis proteomics bring guide study risk assessment early detection cancer . This propose study aim develop non-invasive DNA methylation-based assay system elucidate panel aberrantly hypermethylated gene urothelial tumor urine sediment , improve risk assessment urothelial carcinoma ; early diagnosis , prognosis , prediction response therapeutic regime . This proposal establish several technique study methylation status gene promoter region . Three task achieve study : ( 1 ) Profiling aberrant DNA methylation urothelial carcinoma determine potential prediction biomarkers . ( 2 ) Establishing non-invasive assay detect DNA hypermethylation status exfoliate cell collect void urine ; ( 3 ) Mapping DNA hypermethylation change normal malignant urothelial tumor study underlying mechanism . Through collaboration genetic toxicologist ( Te-Chang Lee , PhD , IBMS ) , urologist ( Yeong-Shiau Pu , MD/PhD , NTUH ) epidemiologists ( Hung-Yi Chiou , PhD , Taipei Medical University ) , explore risk biomarkers urothelial carcinoma .</detailed_description>
