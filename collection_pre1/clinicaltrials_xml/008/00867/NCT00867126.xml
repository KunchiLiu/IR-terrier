	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer That Progressed After Treatment With Gemcitabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To describe change marker insulin resistance , include serum adiponectin level , standard glucose tolerance testing , fast serum glucose insulin level , patient previously treat metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas treat pioglitazone hydrochloride second-line therapy . - To describe change weight patient . - To describe change ECOG performance status patient . - To describe change symptoms quality life patient use validated FACT-Hep scale version 4 questionnaire . Secondary - To determine tumor response measure RECIST criterion patient . - To determine time disease progression patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral pioglitazone hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire baseline , every 4 week therapy , completion therapy . Patients undergo blood sample collection baseline , every 4 week therapy , completion therapy laboratory biomarker study . Samples analyzed level insulin resistance marker ( adiponectin , glucose , insulin ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow monthly 6 month every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
