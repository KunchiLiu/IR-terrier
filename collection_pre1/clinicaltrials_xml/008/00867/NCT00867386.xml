	<brief_title>Desensitization Highly Sensitized Recipients Pancreas Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Please note study observational . The treatment patient discretion care physician . The study investigator ONLY perform data collection analysis . Post transplant patient receive one additional cycle plasma exchange moderate dose Intravenous Immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) ( 0.4 mg/Kg ) . Antibody titer monitor prior plasma exchange immediately follow treatment . At point , since donor antigen know , antibody antigens test minimize cost . We anticipate patient , especially original titer donor-specific antibody ( DSA ) high ( &gt; 1:128 ) , rise DSA observe follow transplant . If indeed DSA present , additional monitoring initiate patient treat plasma exchange/IVIg cycle , antibody monitor immediately cycle . If DSA detect , patient monitor every day schedule first week ; weekly next 3 week monthly 6 month post transplant . Additional testing perform event clinical evidence graft dysfunction , follow sever infection event . Patient follow 12 month post transplant one end point reach : 1. pancreas graft failure : defined return hyperglycemia resume insulin therapy ; 2. patient death due cause function graft</detailed_description>
