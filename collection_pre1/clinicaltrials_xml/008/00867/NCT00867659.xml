	<brief_summary>This pilot study aim address whether prophylactic use Cetrorelix Acetate long gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist protocol post-hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin ) administration significantly reduce incidence OHSS oocyte donor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Cetrotide Acetate Prevention Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome ( OHSS ) Oocyte Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With vary complication , OHSS iatrogenic condition cause ovarian stimulation . Classified mild , moderate , severe , mild OHSS relatively common occur 1/3 woman undergo ovarian stimulation . Symptoms include abdominal ascites , nausea , vomit , increase abdominal girth weight gain , increase range mild moderate . Severe OHSS occur 1 % include hemodynamic instability , thrombosis , pulmonary difficulty , oliguria , rarely death . Therefore , strategy prevent severely decrease incidence OHSS sorely need . More aggressive ovarian stimulation increase risk OHSS , easy predict develop OHSS . Certain patient type , however , consider high risk others , include oocyte donor . OHSS oocyte donor manifest early , i.e . within day oocyte retrieval , yet continue complication pregnancy observe IVF patient . Therefore , vulnerable patient population , oocyte donor ideal study . GnRH antagonists recently use high risk patient undergo IVF . Aside reduction OHSS observe traditional utilization antagonist protocol , alternative us also suggest favorable outcome . Two retrospective , cohort match study evaluate Ganirelix Acetate substitution woman high risk develop OHSS ( E2 &gt; 2,000 pg/ml cycle day 6 project peak E2 &gt; 5,000 pg/ml &gt; 25 follicle day HCG administration ) down-regulated use GnRHa ( use microdose flare protocol ) undergo ovarian stimulation The GnRHa stop low dose hMG continue Ganirelix Acetate start . The Ganirelix Acetate use result average drop 41-49.5 % peak E2 level . While two study provocative , retrospective control . In prospective study evaluate use Ganirelix Acetate prevention OHSS compare coasting , `` historic '' gold standard , Ganirelix Acetate result 36 % drop E2 level one injection 59 % drop peak E2 3 day use ( 46.8 % required one injection , 38.3 % require two , 14.9 % required 3 injection ) oppose 9 % increase E2 level 24 hour coast . The use Ganirelix acetate result significant decrease OHSS risk ( 2.1-2.3 % two retrospective study , 0 % prospective study vs 9-38 % prior publication ) without affect pregnancy outcome . The mean number Ganirelix Acetate injection 1.74 + 0.91 . Although , Ganirelix Acetate appear successful lower OHSS risk previous hCG administration suggest study , pilot study question effect ovulation induction administer . To date , study ask question . All donor evaluate daily hormonal level ( FSH , LH , E2 , P , CBC , comprehensive metabolic profile ( include liver function test ) least 3 day oocyte retrieval . Daily weight abdominal circumference also measure . All oocyte donor also present one last visit one week oocyte retrieval . The incidence OHSS main outcome measure .</detailed_description>
