	<brief_summary>Background : - Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia ( ICL ) condition decrease level CD4+ lymphocytes ( type white blood cell ) , lead opportunistic infection autoimmune disorder disease . Objectives : - To characterize natural history regard CD4+ T cell count onset infection , malignancy , autoimmunity . - To describe immunological status patient affect ICL provide best possible standard therapy eradicate opportunistic infection . - To establish timeline CD4 lymphocytopenia , particular focus define subgroup patient accord decline , stabilization , rise CD4+ T cell count time . - To characterize opportunistic infection occur ICL patient microbiologic molecular level . - To characterize immunophenotype possible genetic immunodeficiency cause ICL . - To determine whether measurable immunologic parameter correlate development opportunistic infection comorbidities lymphoma patient ICL . - To determine whether association ICL autoimmunity . - To determine CD4+ T cell turnover , survival , functionality , cytokine responsiveness ICL patient . Eligibility : - Patients 2 year age old absolute CD4 count le 300 child 6 year old adult less 20 % T cell child younger 6 two occasion least 6 week apart . - Patients negative result HIV test ELISA , Western Blot , viral load . - Patients must underlie immunodeficiency condition , receive cytotoxic chemotherapy ( anti-cancer drug kill cell ) , cancer . Design : - At initial visit National Institutes Health , follow evaluation conduct : - Personal family medical history . - Physical examination , include rheumatology evaluation consultation medically indicate ( e.g. , dermatology , pulmonology , ophthalmology , image study ) . - Blood sample analysis red white blood cell count , liver function , immune hormone , antibody autoantibody level , white blood cell growth function , DNA . - Urinalysis urine pregnancy test female patient childbearing age . - Evaluation treatment active infection medically indicate , include biopsy , buccal swab , pulmonary function test , image study . - Follow-up visit take place approximately every 12 month frequently indicate , continue minimum 4 year maximum 10 year . - Evaluations follow-up include blood sample ( i.e. , CBC differential , biochemical profile , HIV testing , etc . ) urinalysis rheumatology consults .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia ( ICL ) disorder characterize decreased number circulate CD4+ T lymphocytes absence know cause CD4+ lymphocytopenia . ICL define absolute CD4+ T cell count le 300 cells/microliter patient human immunodeficiency virus infection know immunodeficiency syndrome . The cause frequency disorder remain unknown . The condition typically diagnose patient present serious infection . In natural history protocol , evaluate patient CD4+ T cell count 300 cells/microliter . We propose follow 200 ICL patient minimum 4 maximum 14 year , particular focus association ICL autoimmune disease . In addition ICL patient enroll blood relative household contact well understand pathogenesis etiology syndrome . We collect blood immunologic , rheumatologic , genetic test effort identify understand underlie defect cause ICL follow course cohort patient receive best standard therapy opportunistic infection .

	<criteria>ICL PARTICPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible study , patient must satisfy follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Age great equal 18 year 2 . Absolute CD4 count &lt; 300 cells/microL &lt; 20 % total T cell least two occasion least 6 week apart 3 . Ongoing care refer primary care physician 4 . Willingness allow storage blood tissue sample future analysis ICL PARTICPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients ineligible study satisfy follow criterion : 1 . Known infection HIV1 , HIV2 , human Tcell lymphotropic virus ( HTLV1 HTLV2 ) demonstrate ELISA Western blot and/or viral load test 2 . Known underlying immunodeficiency syndrome ICL 3 . Evidence active malignancy 4 . Receipt medication , herbal substance , biologic agent know diminish CD4+ count within 30 day CD4+ lymphocytopenia detect 5 . Any condition judgment investigator would place subject undue risk compromise result study . BLOOD RELATIVE INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible study participation blood relative , subject must ( Bullet ) 18 year age blood relative individual meet meet CDC criterion ICL . HOUSEHOLD CONTACT INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible study participation household contact , subject must great equal to18 year age live within household ICL subject participate protocol . Blood relatives household contact eligible participate .</criteria>
