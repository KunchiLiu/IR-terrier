	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective surgery treat patient bladder cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy see well work compare surgery treat patient bladder cancer receive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine feasibility patient acceptability radical cystectomy v selective bladder preservation ( SBP ) neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma bladder . - To determine compliance rate patient assign treatment . - To determine bladder preservation equivalent radical cystectomy , term overall survival , responder neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Secondary - To compare overall survival patient receive SBP v radical cystectomy . - To determine rate salvage cystectomy patient undergo bladder preservation . - To determine compare toxicity treatment arm . - To determine compare quality life patient treat regimen . - To compare locoregional progression-free metastasis-free survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord cancer center randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Patients assess completion 3 course pre-study neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Patients poor response ( ≥ pT2 , residual pT2 , macroscopic invasive tumor ) undergo immediate radical cystectomy ( within 6 week fo complete chemotherapy ) . Patients* responsive disease ( ≤ pT1 tumor macroscopically normal bladder ) proceed course 4 chemotherapy ( on-study ) follow treatment accord randomization arm . NOTE : *Patients clear bladder unsure histological result prior course 4 also proceed chemotherapy . - Course 4 neoadjuvant chemotherapy : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 cisplatin IV 4 hour day 1 . - Arm I ( radical cystectomy ) : Patients undergo radical cystectomy , include pelvic lymphadenectomy , 4 6 week initiate course 4 chemotherapy . - Arm II ( selective bladder preservation ) : Patients visible residual tumor ( cT0 pT0 ) residual superficial tumor ( pTa , pT1 ) undergo radiotherapy begin within 4-6 week day 1 course 4 continue 6.5 week . Health-related quality life assess periodically . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
