	<detailed_description>This single center , open label , phase 1/2 study two thirty three patient Intermediate-1 , Intermediate-2 , High risk MDS receive ON 01910.Na intravenous continuous infusion ( IVCI ) 24 hour 5 consecutive day every 2 week . In phase 1 component trial maximum tolerate dose ON1910.Na patient Intermediate-1 , Intermediate-2 High Risk myelodysplastic syndrome determine . A standard `` 3+3 '' dose escalation scheme follow six patient treat 800 mg/m2/day dose level . Patients observe 2 cycle dose escalation occur . If none initial three patient 800 mg/m2/day cohort experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , first two cycle , new cohort three patient treated 1500 mg/m2/day dose level . If none initial three patient 1500 mg/m2/day cohort experience DLT first two cycle , three additional patient treated 1500 mg/m2/day level . If one six patient 1500 mg/m2/day dose level experience DLT , dose level confirm MTD dose escalation occur . If one three patient 800 mg/m2/day cohort experience DLT first two cycle , three additional patient treat dose level . Escalation 1500 mg/m2/day proceed one six patient experience DLT 800 mg/m2/day dose level . If two patient 800 mg/m2/day cohort experience DLT first two cycle , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) exceed , dose escalation occur , full safety review determine enrollment patient proceed . If 800 mg/m2/day dose level consideration MTD ( i.e . ≥ 2 patient experience DLT 1500 mg/m2/day dose level ) , three patient treat escalation 1500 mg/m2/day , three additional patient accrue . If one six patient 800 mg/m2/day dose level experience DLT , dose level confirm MTD . Once phase 1 portion study complete , accrual phase 2 portion begin . Patients treat MTD phase 1 portion include phase 2 component evaluate response secondary end point . The total study duration 29 week , include 2-week screening phase , 23-week dosing phase , 4-week follow-up phase begin last dose ON 01910.Na . Patients assessed response undergo follow . Patients drop reason replace . Patients achieve complete partial response stabilization disease week 25 eligible receive additional 24 week ON 01910.Na dose receive first 24 week treatment ( 800 1500 mg/m2/day IVCI 5 day Q2W ) .</detailed_description>
