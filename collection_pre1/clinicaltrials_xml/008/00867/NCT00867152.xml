	<brief_title>GSK1349572 Drug Interaction With Etravirine Either Darunavir/Ritonavir Lopinavir/Ritonavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study three period , randomize , open label study . Approximately 18 healthy subject receive GSK1349572 50mg q24h 5 day ( Treatment A ) Period 1 . Subjects administer GSK1349572 50mg q24h combination either LPV/RTV 400/100 mg q12h etravirine 200mg q12h ( Treatment B , n=9 ) DRV/RTV 600/100 mg q12h etravirine 200mg q12h ( Treatment C , n=9 ) 14 day Period 2 follow washout period . GSK1349572 PK data obtain Periods 1 2 use inform decision make Period 3 . If GSK1349572 Cτ reduce 50 % Period 2 compare Period 1 , subject return clinic receive GSK1349572 50mg q12h combination ETV either DRV/RTV LPV/RTV Period 3 . Safety evaluation serial PK sample collect treatment period . A follow-up visit occur 7-14 day last dose study drug . All dos study drug take follow moderate fat meal .</detailed_description>
