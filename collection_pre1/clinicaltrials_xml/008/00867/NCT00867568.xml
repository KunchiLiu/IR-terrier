	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate new investigational drug ( TPI 287 ) neuroblastoma medulloblastoma alone combination temozolomide ( currently approve drug ) . An investigational drug one yet approve Food Drug Administration . This investigational drug call TPI 287 . This study look safety tolerability TPI 287 alone combination temozolomide , look establish safe dose agent . The study also look tumor 's response drug , primary objective study . TPI 287 show effective stop tumor growth also show safe three different animal specie . TPI 287 test human four clinical trial , approximately 100 subject various type cancer receive drug . All subject receive TPI 287 adult . TPI 287 test pediatric population study . Temozolomide test recurrent neuroblastoma show activity recently publish study . Preclinical study TPI combination temozolomide show minimum additive effect . The ability temozolomide TPI 287 effective combination suggest two drug show even great activity use together .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TPI 287 Patients With Refractory Recurrent Neuroblastoma Medulloblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroblastoma : Neuroblastoma common pediatric extracranial solid tumor account 7 % 10 % childhood cancer ( American Cancer Society 2008 ; Bernstein et al . 1992 ) . Whereas prognosis infant neuroblastoma generally good , currently 30 % child diagnose 12-15 month age survive despite aggressive multimodal therapy ( Brodeur et al 1993 ; Park et al 2008 ) . High-dose chemotherapy ( HDC ) follow hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) maintenance therapy retinoic acid improve survival 35 % child present metastatic NB , 5-year event-free survival remain 50 % ( Matthay et al , 1999 ; Hartmann , et al , 1999 ) . Consequently , evaluation new drug strongly need disease . 1.2 Medulloblastoma : Medulloblastoma common malignant brain tumor child account 16 % brain tumor child 0-14 year old 6 % adolescent 15-19 year old ( CBTRUS 2008 ) . Current therapy child disseminate disease associate severe long-term toxicity , lead cure minority case . ( Partap et al , 2007 ) . Thus , development new therapies—especially one favorable toxicity profiles—would represent significant improvement treatment disease . Although report survival rate child chemosensitive relapse medulloblastoma approach 40 % follow intensive chemotherapy combine autologous stem cell support , recent data look survival patient relapse modern combination chemotherapy radiation also order 10-15 % . ( Rood , et al , 2004 ) As , new therapeutic approach need treat child . 1.3 The Investigational Product TPI 287 1.3.1 Preclinical Studies : Tapestry Pharmaceuticals , Inc. develop novel anti-microtubule agent , TPI 287 , Archer Biosciences , Inc. sponsor . TPI 287 synthetically manufacture naturally occur taxanes extract yew start material . The synthesis involve modification side chain make drug lipophilic , modification baccatin ring structure intent circumvent MDR-based resistance allow bind mutant tubulin . Selection TPI 287 also make basis high potency drug several neuroblastoma cell line xenograft model ( see ) . In vitro , TPI 287 show comparable cytotoxicity paclitaxel several MDR- cell line , 5 - 3900-fold active several comparator compound MDR+ cell line . In MCF-7-AR breast cancer cell , display MDR-based resistance , TPI 287 20-times active paclitaxel . Similar finding observe MDR+ cell derive colorectal , breast prostate cancer , well neuroblastoma , noted.TPI 287 also evaluate variety xenograft model . As vitro , TPI 287 superior paclitaxel vivo MCF-7-AR xenograft . TPI 287 also superior activity compare SN-38 HCT-15 HCT-116 colon cancer xenograft ; compare docetaxel PC3 prostate cancer xenograft ; compare docetaxel doxorubicin MV522 NSCLC xenograft . Activity glioblastoma show transplanted xenograft , efficacy demonstrable use IV oral administration . In addition , orthotopic xenograft use U251 cell implant brain nude mouse , treatment either TPI 287 , temozolomide , combination compare control animal , evaluate median survival ( 10 animal per group ) well animal whose survival extend beyond 110 day . The result study , repeat corroboration outside facility , show Table 4 . Significant synergy improvement long term survival see combination temozolomide ( TMZ ) plus TPI 287.Potent activity also show neuroblastoma cell line previously note , also demonstratable transplanted xenograft , show great activity paclitaxel , docetaxel nab-paclitaxel . Studies recently complete ( Sholler , et al , personal communication ) show TPI 287 activity additional neuroblastoma cell line well medulloblastoma cell line increase efficacy TPI 287 combine TMZ neuroblastoma.Toxicology study demonstrate TPI 287 generally well tolerate . The MTD rat 48 mg/kg dog , 12.5 mg/kg . Toxicity primarily characterize bone marrow suppression mucositis .</detailed_description>
