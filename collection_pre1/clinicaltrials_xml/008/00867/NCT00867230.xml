	<detailed_description>FTS design interfere cancer cell 's ability reproduce . Before start receive drug study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your complete medical history record , physical exam . You ask side effect medication take . Your weight vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature ) measure . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . You ask ability perform everyday task . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . A bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy collect check status disease . To collect bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount ( 1 teaspoon ) bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . If find eligible study , take FTS mouth , morning night food , Days 1-21 28-day study `` cycle . '' The amount study drug receive base enter study . At least 3 participant take FTS dose level . Doses increase next group 3 participant base side effect see previous group . Each new group participant receive high dose level previous group , level reach side effect consider intolerable . After cycle , doctor may decide increase dose intolerable side effect benefit study drug . If experience intolerable side effect cycle therapy FTS , dose may reduce , delay , may take study . On Day 1 study , weight vital sign measure . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect routine test . You take even dose FTS Day 1 . On Days 8,15 , 22 first cycle , weight vital sign measure . You ask side effect , medication take . On Day 15 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) also draw routine test . During Cycle 1 , Days 1 , 8 , 15 , blood ( 1 tablespoon per draw ) drawn find much drug blood different time point . This help researcher learn FTS process body . This call pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . Blood drawn morning dose FTS , 30 , 60 , 90 minute take morning dose , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 24 hour take morning dose . During Cycle 1 , Days 1 15 , blood ( 3 tablespoon per draw ) drawn determine FTS work leukemia cell . This blood drawn 24 hour , take morning dose Day 1 take dose Day 15 . On Day 1 cycle Cycle 1 , weight vital sign measure . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . You ask ability perform everyday task . You ask side effect , medication take . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 every cycle Cycle 1 , ask side effect medication take . On Day 15 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) also draw routine test , weight vital sign measure . You may remain study long benefit . You take study benefit experience intolerable side effect . Thirty ( 30 ) day longer take study drug , end-of-study visit . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . Your weight vital sign measure . You ask ability perform everyday task . You ask side effect , medication take . You ECG evaluation disease , may include bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy . This investigational study . FTS FDA approve commercially available , authorize use research . Up 30 patient take part multicenter study . Up 20 patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
