	<brief_summary>Objectives : - To find chance develop serious illness get AIDS le patient start take HIV medicine time cluster-of-differentiation-4 ( CD4 ) + cell count still fairly high , instead wait CD4+ count level good evidence start medicine . - To learn strategy start HIV medicine early might affect aspect care , chance develop illness resistance HIV medicine , frequency doctor visit , cost medical care , general health satisfaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Most guideline agree number CD4+ cell ( cell blood help fight infection ) drop 350 cells/mm3 , symptom AIDS , start take HIV medicine . There randomized trial support recommendation . ( Randomized trial usually consider strong form evidence support treatment decision . Other study , like observational study , provide evidence , evidence often consider weak evidence randomize trial . A randomized trial give certain information well treatment work randomization make sure group similar except treatment receive . ) Some expert believe HIV treatment start even number CD4+ cell 350 cells/mm3 . For example , guideline issue US December 2009 include new recommendation start HIV medicine CD4+ cell count 350 500 cells/mm3 . However , recommendation base information observational study , randomize trial . We study find chance get serious illness get AIDS less people start take HIV medicine time CD4+ cell count still fairly high , instead wait take HIV medicine CD4+ count good evidence start medicine . Objectives : - To find chance develop serious illness get AIDS le patient start take HIV medicine time CD4+ cell count still fairly high , instead wait CD4+ count level good evidence start medicine . - To learn strategy start HIV medicine early might affect aspect care , chance develop illness resistance HIV medicine , frequency doctor visit , cost medical care , general health satisfaction . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age older infect HIV , CD4+ cell count great 500 cells/mm3 , never antiretroviral therapy treat HIV . Design : - Initial screen visit ( 2 ) draw blood CD4+ cell count provide full medical history - Patients randomly split two group : Early : Patients begin receive HIV medication start study . Deferred : Patients begin take HIV medication CD4 drop 350 cells/mm3 , develop AIDS symptom HIV infection . - HIV medication patient determine study doctor . - Evaluations treatment period : - Physical examination , include vital sign body weight check , pregnancy test woman become pregnant . - Questions daily life , include sexual behavior . - Blood urine test . - Heart test electrocardiogram . - Patients return evaluation 1 4 month randomization , every 4 month thereafter duration study . Substudies take advantage START randomization compare outcomes people start ART early vs. later . The purpose randomize study determine whether immediate initiation antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) superior deferral ART CD4+ decline 350 cells/mm ( 3 ) term morbidity mortality HIV-1 ( subsequently refer HIV ) infect person antiretroviral naive CD4+ count 500 cells/mm ( 3 ) . The study enroll estimate 4,000 participant . Participants follow least 3 year enrollment , common closing date . Substudies take advantage START randomization compare outcomes people start ART early vs. later . These measure outcomes require entire sample size START determine whether early ART relate difference outcome course study .</detailed_description>
