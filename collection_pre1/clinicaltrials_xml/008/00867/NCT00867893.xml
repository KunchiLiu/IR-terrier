	<brief_title>Suggested Immobilization Test ( SIT ) Test Early Detection Restless Legs Syndrome ( RLS ) Augmentation - Proof Concept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long term dopaminergic treatment RLS produce exacerbation RLS symptoms bad treatment significant percentage ( 5 - 70 % ) treat . This appear related half-life , dose duration treatment . Shorter half-life medication appear produce augmentation . Once start augmentation appear progressive many patient end result patient much severe RLS symptom treatment . These symptom still temporarily reduce add dopaminergic treatment , eventually fail suffice even high dopaminergic dos . The problem find way detect augmentation early dopamine treatment determine true rate occurrence problem change treatment strategy problem become severe . The suggested immobilization test create stimulus situation protract rest lie provokes RLS symptom . It provide sensitive test severity symptom.. It therefore provide early detection exacerbation symptom occur RLS augmentation . In addition diphenhydramine also create exacerbation RLS symptom . This exacerbation would amplify current severity RLS could provide tool enhance degree augmentation . Thus test diphenhydramine challenge dose SIT test could provide even sensitive measure augmentation The investigator specifically hypothesize : 1 . The objective measure SIT test reveal increase severity RLS occur RLS augmentation time augmentation detect usual subjective clinical assessment . 2 . An oral dose 25 mg diphenhydramine take 45 minute SIT test amplify augmentation effect show objective measure SIT . This provide enhance detection augmentation time detect either SIT test alone clinical evaluation . This study may first time provide standard highly repeatable objective measure RLS augmentation sensitive careful clinical evaluation someone well trained detect RLS augmentation . As would prove clinically useful evaluate RLS treatment progress . It would also provide efficient method evaluate augmentation potential new medication RLS . .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Primary RLS ( exclude secondary RLS include related neuropathy medication ) 2 . Adult adolescents 18 year age old 3 . One follow 2 criterion must meet : RLS treatment either ropinirole pramipexole nonDA treatment ( opioid GABA active hypnotic ) , first dose day take 4:30 PM . ( Note allow patient enter usual tapered withdrawal another medication concurrent gradual start DA agonist opioid period 12 month . In case initial evaluation must occur least 6 week discontinue prior drug treatment . ) OR Off RLS medication treatment least 6 week AND plan start DA agonist nonDA treatment ( opioid GABA active hypnotic ) RLS medication treatment . 1 . Pregnant lactating . 2 . Inadequate birth control female able become pregnant . 3 . History allergic reaction diphenhydramine . 4 . History major psychiatric chronic neurological disorder would affect RLS treatment judgment . These include limited bipolar depression , major affective disorder , schizophrenia , obsessivecompulsive disorder , neurodegenerative disease . 5 . History another major sleep disorder RLS insomnia : narcolepsy , significant sleepdisordered breathing ( DBR &gt; 15/hr ) , circadian rhythm disorder . 6 . History use dopamine antagonist within last year reason treat nausea . 7 . History use tramadol within last 3 month . 8 . Unable give inform consent .</criteria>
