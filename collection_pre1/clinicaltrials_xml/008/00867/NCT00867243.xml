	<brief_title>Prediction Hepatitis C Recurrence Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish whether in-vitro donor-specific immune reactivity pattern differentiate liver transplant recipient positive Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) high risk low risk graft loss secondary early recurrence HCV . An assessment recipient 's donor-specific immune status achieve measure T-cell activity , specifically alloreactive prim ( donor-specific ) T cell activity . It show detection IFN-y short-term enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-spot ( ELISPOT ) assay consistent presence prim memory T cell ( 6 ) . In transplantation setting , T cell allograft recipient secret IFN-y short in-vitro exposure donor cell represent prior sensitization recipient donor antigens vivo . Clinically interpreted - prim event may signify presence up-coming , on-going , rejection episode . Our limited preliminary data suggest additional potential clinical value in-vitro assessment donor-specific IFN-y production predict liver transplant recipient high risk recurrence Hepatitis C .</detailed_description>
