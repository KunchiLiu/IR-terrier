	<detailed_description>This study design randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multiple dose study evaluate safety tolerability Cat-PAD cat allergic subject allergic rhinoconjunctivitis control asthma . The efficacy Cat-PAD also explore subject use EPSR , LPSR , CPT , level cat specific IgE . A single centre initiate first , second centre include backup , need , enable recruitment number meet . Three cohort study , depend treatment use control subject 's asthma : Cohort 1 - inhale salbutamol , Cohort 2 - inhale corticosteroid , Cohort 3 - inhale corticosteroid plus LABA The study consist 3 study period . In Period 1 , Screening perform maximum 8 week randomisation may consist one two visit clinic , investigator 's discretion . Baseline Challenge consist single visit 1 4 week randomisation . In Period 2 , subject cohort comply inclusion/exclusion criterion randomise either 3 nmol Cat-PAD placebo . Treatments administer every 2 week ( ±2 day ) 14 week In Period 3 , Post Treatment Challenge consist single visit 24-28 week first administration treatment period assessment perform identical baseline challenge . Follow-up conduct 3-10 day PTC .</detailed_description>
