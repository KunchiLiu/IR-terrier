	<brief_title>Improving Sleep Daytime Functioning Among Children Diagnosed With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parents , researcher , clinician long suspected inadequate sleep many child diagnose Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) exacerbate symptom hyperactivity inattentiveness , lead cognitive behavioral disruption . Extant sleep study report upwards 50 % child diagnose ADHD display behavior associate chronic sleep disruption ( comparison non-diagnosed youth ) . Although study attempt alleviate sleep difficulty , intervention study use one treatment modality . This study incorporate systematic , multi-method treatment intervention protocol combine behavioral pharmacologic strategy aim improve sleep functioning among child ADHD . The specific aim study ( ) examine effect structure sleep behavioral/pharmacologic intervention protocol improve sleep onset efficiency , ( b ) examine improvement may alleviate daytime neuropsychological ( i.e. , response time ) behavioral deficit associate ADHD . The study take place ADHD Clinic . Twelve child ( age 6-12 ) , follow confirm diagnosis ADHD meet criterion evaluation , sign parent/child consent/assent , randomly assign immediate treatment delay treatment group ( 6 group ) . Children immediate treatment group receive sleep intervention protocol , delayed treatment group initially receive sleep , activity , daytime assessment schedule treatment group without treatment method . They offer treatment method immediate treatment group week 5 . The study occur separate phase . Phase one consist intake session ADHD Clinic determine eligibility study . Phase two immediately follow ( eligible participant ) consist one-week baseline gather sleep , neuropsychological functioning daytime behavior data . Sleep functioning measure use subjective ( i.e. , parent sleep log ) objective measure ( i.e. , actigraphy ) , response time assess use device measure continuous reaction-time performance . Attention ADHD-related behavior collect use parent- teacher rating scale baseline . Phase three , last 4 week , consist parent child treatment group come Clinic learn specific sequence intervention , first begin behavioral method , follow melatonin ( necessary ) improve sleep functioning ( 80 % baseline ) . Parents child delay treatment phase come Clinic phase three , contact brief phone interview per week . They ask question pertain change sleep daytime behavior . Finally , Phase 4 consist parent return ADHD Clinic , measure administered end Baseline repeat . At time , delayed treatment group may enter treatment phase . A repeated measure ANOVA use group status ( treatment vs. treatment ) across two time point ( baseline , post-sleep intervention ) ass change sleep daytime functioning time . Although group-by-time interaction indicate treatment efficacy , small pilot study ; small number participant group likely preclude power determine statistically . Instead , effect size subjective measure use describe justify , appropriate , expansion study subsequent grant application .</detailed_description>
