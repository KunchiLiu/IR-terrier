	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bevacizumab sorafenib may also stop growth liver cancer block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This randomized phase I/II trial study best dose bevacizumab give together sorafenib first-line therapy treat patient locally advance metastatic liver cancer . ( Phase I close accrual 11/03/2010 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Sorafenib First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose bevacizumab combination sorafenib tosylate patient locally advance metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma . ( Phase I close accrual 11/03/2010 ) - Determine time progression patient . ( Phase II ) Secondary - Determine safety regimen patient . ( Phase I close accrual 11/03/2010 ) - Assess tolerability regimen patient . ( Phase I close accrual 11/03/2010 ) - Determine overall survival patient . ( Phase II ) - Determine tumor response ( 6 month ) patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) - Determine progression-free survival patient . ( Phase II ) - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) - Assess occurrence adverse event patient . ( Phase II ) Tertiary - Determine relationship tumor biomarkers circulate biomarkers vascular response clinical outcome patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose escalation study follow randomized phase II study . - Phase I ( close accrual 11/03/2010 ) : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-28 bevacizumab IV day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Phase II : Patients stratify accord gender ( female v male ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , Child-Pugh class ( A v B7 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate day 1-28 twice daily bevacizumab IV day 1 15 . - Arm II : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically analysis circulate endothelial cell circulate endothelial progenitor cell angiogenic protein plasma ELISA . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
