	<brief_summary>The overall objective three-armed randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) determine comparative efficacy three treatment hypersensitive noncarious cervical lesion ( NCLs ) : chemoactive dentifrice use , dentin bonding agent ( DBA ) sealing , flowable resin-based composite restoration . The primary outcome study reduction/elimination hypersensitivity effect treatment measure patient-reported outcome . Secondary outcome , determine laboratory evaluation intraoral replica pre- posttreatment NCL surface , tubule occlusion , retention resin coating , retention restoration , change lesion size . Outcomes ascertained via follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To compare reduction hypersensitivity study teeth measurement patient-reported outcome among three treatment group . Specific Aim 2 : To recruit subject teeth hypersensitive NCLs , measure baseline sensitivity subject quality life , administer one three different treatment three randomize group subject , determine immediate posttreatment hypersensitivity . Specific Aim 3 : To compare degree tubule occlusion three treatment associate finding posttreatment hypersensitivity , patient-reported outcome , restoration retention . Treatment NCLs remain controversial . Few study compare treatment method financial implication . This RCT determine reduction NCL hypersensitivity patient-reported outcome 6-month period three different treatment . This first practice-based research network RCT combine objective clinical assessment NCL treatment patient-reported outcome laboratory examination dentin tubule occlusion lesion size .</brief_summary>
