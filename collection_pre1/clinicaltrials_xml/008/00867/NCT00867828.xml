	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) irreversible , progressive neurodegenerative disorder , characterize gradual cognitive deterioration , change behavior personality . These symptom relate neurochemical change , neural death , breakdown inter-neural connection . Loss short-term memory often first sign , follow cognitive deficit involve multiple function . Early stage AD mild cognitive impairment characterize milder form memory loss cognitive impairment could precede onset dementia AD . Prevention cognitive decline inpatient possible precursor condition paramount importance give reversibility AD possible . It estimate currently 5.1 million people Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) United States ( Alzheimer 's Association , 2007 ) number expect reach 13.2 million 2050 ( Hebert et al. , 2003 ) . Alzheimer 's rank 7th lead cause death US people age 5th people age 65 old ( National Center Health Statistics , 2004 ) . In Canada 280,000 people 65 estimate AD , 750,000 expect disease 2031 ( Alzheimer Society Canada , 2006 ) . It estimate 10 % North Americans age 70 year early stage AD mild cognitive impairment . Older age , low educational level APOE ε4 allele risk factor AD ( Lindsay et al. , 2002 ) . Moreover , patient APOE ε4 allele show earlier faster cognitive decline ε2 allele relate slow decline . Homozygotous ε4 patient show even earlier faster decline heterozygote ( Martins et al. , 2005 ) . While symptomatic treatment focus therapeutic investigation AD , recent research effort target toxic effect amyloid beta ( Aβ ) peptides order modify underlie pathophysiology disease . The presently approve treatment give small clinical improvement prevent progression disease , mild cognitive impairment dementia death ( Birks et al. , 2000 ; AD2000 Collaborative Group , 2004 ; Birks , 2006 ; Birks &amp; Harvey , 2006 ; Loy &amp; Schneider , 2006 ) . Alzheimer 's disease characterize two main pathological feature brain : intracellular neurofibrillary tangle form abnormal protein τ ( tau ) ; extracellular neuritic plaque form β-amyloid peptide ( Aβ ) ( Kuo et al. , 1996 ) . The overproduction Aβ42 genetically induce environmental risk factor require get fully symptomatic AD ( Grant et al. , 2002 ) . Among risk factor , low docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) one important dietary risk factor AD ( Morris et al. , 2005 ) . The reason impact DHA learn memory association AD unclear could result loss synapsis ( Montine et al. , 2004 ) , normally rich DHA ( Salem et al. , 2001 ) , particularly important postsynaptic transmission neuroprotection ( Bazan , 2003 ) . Studies animal model consistently show brain n-3 fatty acid content highly dependent dietary intake age ( Favrere et al. , 2000 ; Youdim et al. , 2000 ; Calon &amp; Cole , 2007 ) . Several animal study , show increase DHA intake find increase hippocampal acetycholine level derivative , neuroprotectin DI , decease cell death ( Aid et al , 2005 ; Lukiw et al. , 2005 ) . A study conduct aged mouse show DHA intake improved memory performance ( Lim et al . 2001 ) . In another Alzheimer 's disease mouse model , reduction dietary DHA show loss postsynaptic protein associate increased oxidation , localize dendrite . However , group DHA-restricted mouse give DHA , show sign DHA intake protect dendritic pathology , imply DHA could useful prevent cognitive impairment Alzheimer 's Disease ( Calon et al. , 2004 ) . Several epidemiological study show protective effect associate increase fish intake ( direct source omega 3 fatty acid ) dementia cognitive impairment decline ( Kalmijin et al . 1997 , Barberger-Gateau et al . 2002 ; Morris et al 2003 ) . Recently , one large randomize double-blind placebo-controlled study find 1.6 g DHA 0.7 EPA may beneficial reduce risk AD ( Freund-Levi et al , 2006 ) . In addition , mount evidence dietary supplementation Omega 3 Fatty acid may beneficial different psychiatric condition mood behaviour , depression dementia ( Bourre et al. , 2005 ; Peet Stokes , 2005 ; Stoll et al. , 1999 ) . Krill small crustacean thrives deep cold ocean water form important part life chain , provide nutrition array marine mammal , bird fish . Neptune Krill oil ( NKO ) rich source omega-3 omega-9 fatty acid phospholipid , carry thus functionalize omega-3 fatty acid ( EPA/DHA ) attach . Phospholipids important protect membrane toxic injury free radical attack ( Everson , I et al . 2000 ) . NKO contain two main potent antioxidant ; carotenoid ( astaxanthin ) flavonoid ( novel due animal source ) . Astaxanthin show strong antioxidant activity alpha-tocopherol , beta-carotene , lycopene lutein . Flavonoids , traditionally extract fruit , plant , vegetable algae study 60 year antioxidant activity undoubted . The hypothesis NKO effective AD base high content phospholipid DHA antioxidant cross blood - brain barrier well essential brain nutrient . In addition , NKO proven increase HDL-C relate decreased plague formation relate decrease blood supply brain , one factor cause AD progression . The aim current study challenge hypothesis randomize double blind study .</detailed_description>
