	<brief_summary>The study design non-randomized , open label , single center Phase II trial . Eligible patient woman confirm diagnosis ovary , fallopian tube cancer primary peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma relapse refractory therapy primary treatment disease . Patients treat bendamustine Hydrochloride 90 mg/m2 intravenously day 1 ( ± 1 day ) 2 ( ± 1 day ) every 28 day . If grade ≥3 hematologic adverse event appear dose escalate 120 mg/m2 day 1 ( ± 1 day ) 2 ( ± 1 day ) every 28 day cycle 2 . 20 patient enrol study . OBJECTIVES Hypothesis/Rationale : To determine efficacy safety bendamustine hydrochloride , woman platinum taxane refractory ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Trial Bendamustine Hydrochloride Women With Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bendamustine , non-cross resistant cytotoxic , potential offer new regimen treatment ovarian cancer woman refractory standard drug regimen . Non-cross resistance platinum critical development effective salvage regimens platinum resistant population . In addition bendamustine 's cytotoxic effect think occur via several mechanistic pathway , apoptosis , DNA repair , DNA replication , DNA transcription . The study seek determine efficacy safety bendamustine woman advance ovarian cancer .</detailed_description>
