	<brief_summary>The purpose study test two quit smoking therapy study brain function therapy use . You randomly assign ( like flip coin ) one two group . The first therapy Extinction-Based therapy ( EBT ) . If group , switch smoke denicotinized cigarette wear 21 mg/d nicotine patch one month prior quit date . The second therapy standard Nicotine Replacement therapy ( NRT ) . If group , smoke usual brand cigarette quit date . Following quit date , group undergo standard nicotine replacement therapy ( 21 mg/d 6 week ; 14 mg/d 2 week , 7 mg/d 2 week ) . In addition , recruit sample former smoker regular user e-cigarettes . This group [ ECIG ] undergo screen baseline assessment EBT NRT group completion fMRI1 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree study , ask sign consent form prior test procedure . You ask come laboratory screen session . The screening session take approximately 1.5 hour complete , include questionnaire , physical sample collection . Pregnant nursing mother allow participate study . If test positive illegal drug use , allow participate study . Depending result screen procedure may eligible study . If medical condition would make participation risky , feel comfortable participate study , give instruction regard rest study session ask return . Smoker participants complete screen visit ( describe ) meet study requirement complete 8 lab visit , 1 fMRI training session , 3 fMRI session , 2 follow-up visit . ECIG participant complete screen visit meet study requirement complete 1 fMRI training session 1 fMRI session . First randomly assign ( like draw hat ) study group , either EBT NRT group . In extinction-based therapy ( EBT ) group , participant switch smoke denicotinized cigarette wear 21 mg/d nicotine patch one month prior quit date ; meanwhile , smoker assign nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) group smoke usual brand cigarette quit date . Following quit date , group undergo standard nicotine replacement therapy ( 21 mg/d 6 week ; 14 mg/d 2 week , 7 mg/d 2 week ) . Eight lab visit ( V1 - V8 ) conduct 16 week follow enrollment study . These visit largely identical , except instruction reminder upcoming event vary session session . At lab visit follow collect : vitals ( heart rate , blood pressure weight ) ; breath CO ( Carbon Monoxide ) saliva sample test smoke nicotine level ; measure smoke withdrawal mood . You give daily diary record smoking behavior study medication . You give instruction use study material . Advice quit minimal support provide request visit . Each lab visit require 20-30 minute time . Directly follow V1 undergo training session , familiarize aspect fMRI session include tasks equipment . You situate scanner simulator , simulate sound equipment use fMRI scanner . One task require view picture people smoke people everyday activity . After task , quizzed picture saw . During another task , present stream gray , yellow , blue color circle instructed press button every time see `` Go '' trial inhibit response ( press button ) present `` No-Go '' trial . The training session require 1 hour participant time . fMRI Sessions : You ask complete three fMRI scan session : baseline scan ( fMRI-1 ) ; scan 4 week start treatment ( fMRI-2 ) ; final scan 24 hour quit date ( fMRI-3 ) . The first 20 minute scan session follow protocol lab visit . Following , fMRI-1 fMRI-2 ask smoke cigarette ( usual brand denicotinized depend session group ) . No cigarette smoke prior fMRI-3 . After smoke cigarette sit quiet room read magazine 30 minute . Following 30 min rest period , escort fMRI suite Duke University Medical Center . Once inside , complete questionnaire regard current mood withdrawal symptom . We take CO saliva sample begin scan . If wearing nicotine replacement patch , remove enter scanner . Then give specific instruction regard data collection procedure place scanner . During scan perform task , lie still take picture brain . After removed scanner , complete post-session withdrawal mood questionnaire replace remove patch . End-of-session instruction provide : - At end fMRI-1 , ECIG participant release study . Smoker participant randomly assign either EBT NRT group , give supply information regard upcoming session . - At end fMRI-2 , remind quit date agree upon previously , give supply information regard quitting . - At end fMRI-3 , give reminder upcoming session . You instructed consume alcohol night scan session . We ask breath saliva sample session make sure follow direction wear patch smoke usual brand denicotinized cigarette instruct . If test indicate follow direction , send home ( consider miss visit ) visit re-scheduled . If occurs 2 consecutive visit , participation study terminate . Follow-Up Sessions : After complete study visit , ask return two follow-up session , one 6 month one 12 month visit 1 . At follow-up session ask breath saliva sample , fill paperwork regard mood current smoking status .</detailed_description>
