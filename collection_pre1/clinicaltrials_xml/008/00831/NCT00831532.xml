	<criteria>Healthy ( healthy define absence clinicallyrelevant abnormality identify detailed medical history , full physical examination , 12lead ECG clinical laboratory test ) . Free medical surgical condition might significantly interfere gastrointestinal absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion Dimebon . Demographically comparable subject mild moderate hepatic impairment . Subjects hepatic impairment : Screening medical history , physical examination , vital sign , 12lead ECG , clinical laboratory test perform within 28 day first dose study medication , abnormal finding relate subject 's underlying condition acceptable . Satisfy criterion Class A , B , C modify ChildPugh classification [ Mild ( ChildPugh Scores 56 point ) , moderate ( ChildPugh Scores 79 point ) , severe ( ChildPugh Scores &gt; 9 &lt; 12 point ) ] within 14 day first dose study medication . A diagnosis hepatic impairment due cirrhosis , secondary disease , confirm documented medical history , physical examination , liver biopsy hepatic ultrasound , CT scan MRI . Subjects present follow included trial : CYP2D6 PM genotype , identify screen genotyping . A known sensitivity Dimebon . Exposure within previous three month drug know negative effect skeletal muscle reproductive organ . History febrile illness within 5 day prior first dose . Any condition possibly affect drug absorption ( e.g. , gastrectomy , active peptic ulcer within last 3 month ) .</criteria>
