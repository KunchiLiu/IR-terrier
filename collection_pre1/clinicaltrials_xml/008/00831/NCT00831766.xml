	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study Idarubicin + Cytarabine Lenalidomide Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) , Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All three drug FDA approve treat patient United States America . Idarubicin Cytarabine combination therapy standard treatment patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Lenalidomide FDA approve retreat patient Multiple Myeloma Myelodysplastic syndrome specific change DNA . Loss specific part DNA also see patient AML . This phase 1/2 , dose-escalation trial Lenalidomide give combination idarubicin + cytarabine . During phase 1 , enroll patient AML involve del 5q31 ; 2 ) patient MDS RAEB-2 associate monosomy 5 segmental deletion involve 5q31 , either alone additional cytogenetic abnormality , 3 ) old patient type karyotypic profile effective reliable standard care remain develop . All 3 group patient define population patient poor prognosis . Dose escalation lenalidomide use standard 3x3 design . Dose escalation Lenalidomide take place , dose idarubicin cytarabine constant . This trial induction component , consolidation component , maintenance component . Overall safety MTD determine induction phase . During phase 2 , enroll patient AML age ≥ 60 year . During phase 2 , efficacy combination Lenalidomide + idarubicin + cytarabine , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Lenalidomide ( determine phase 1 ) , test .</detailed_description>
