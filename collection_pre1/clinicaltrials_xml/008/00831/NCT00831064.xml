	<brief_title>A Trial Four Different Bowel Cleansing Regimens Prior Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adequate bowel preparation imperative diagnostic accuracy therapeutic safety . Several bowel cleanse preparation approve Health Canada commonly use prior colonoscopy . Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) consider `` gold standard '' bowel preparation . It nonabsorbable solution pass bowel without net absorption secretion . Significant fluid electrolyte shift therefore avoid . However , large volume ( 4 liter ) , salty taste sulphur smell frequently lead poor tolerability compliance , sometimes result inadequate bowel preparation . Several bowel cleanse preparation develop include sodium phosphate ( NaP ) , magnesium citrate , sodium picosulphate plus magnesium oxide ( PSMC ) -containing preparation . NaP low volume hyperosmotic solution draw plasma water bowel lumen promote colonic cleansing . As result , significant fluid electrolyte shift occur . The advantage low volume well patient tolerance compare PEG . However , even healthy individual severe electrolyte disturbance report 2 required dos take 12 hour apart . Therefore Health Canada recommend 2 dos NaP take 24 hour apart . Patients renal failure , congestive heart failure liver failure avoid preparation ( Grade I A ) . PSMC hyperosmotic saline laxative increase intraluminal volume result increased intestinal motility . Magnesium , constituent PSMC , stimulate release cholecystokinin also stimulate intestinal motility . Since magnesium eliminate kidney , patient renal insufficiency failure also avoid preparation . Many randomize controlled trial compare efficacy tolerability various bowel cleanse regimen . Studies compare full-volume ( 4 liter ) PEG low-volume ( 2 liter ) PEG combine magnesium citrate bisacodyl demonstrate equal efficacy colonic cleanse improved patient tolerance . However , little data low volume PEG compare NaP . The meta-analysis twenty nine trial optimal bowel preparation conclude NaP effective bowel cleanse 4-liter PEG PSMC . However , three trial compare NaP PSMC meet inclusion exclusion criterion meta-analysis result conflict . Also three trial compare PEG PSMC meta-analysis inconclusive data . Moreover , mean number patient per trial small 223 , high number patient trial 500 . A consensus document prepare three lead American gastrointestinal society ( American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy , American Society Colon Rectal Surgeons Society American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons ) well position paper Canadian Association Gastroenterology identify lack ideal bowel preparation meet criteria . Furthermore , need study identify follow area : 1 . Two-liter PEG v NaP 2 . PSMC v NaP Outpatients need undergo routine colonoscopy recruit . Each patient randomly assign one four bowel preparation give consent participate study : 1 . Group 1 . 4L PEG . 2 . Group 2 . 2L PEG plus 4 tablet bisacodyl . 3 . Group 3 . 90 cc NaP . 4 . Group 4 . PSMC plus 1 bottle Mg-citrate ( 300 cc ) .</detailed_description>
