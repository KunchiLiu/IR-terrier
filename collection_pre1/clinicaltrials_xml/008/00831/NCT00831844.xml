	<brief_title>Cixutumumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate IMC-A12 ( cixutumumab ) administer various stratum recurrent/refractory malignant solid tumor childhood young adulthood . II . To define describe toxicity IMC-A12 . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics IMC-A12 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine relationship tumor expression insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -I , IGF-II , IGF-I receptor ( IR ) response IMC-A12 . II . To determine human anti-human antibody ( HAHA ) response treatment IMC-A12 . III . To evaluate effect IMC-A12 circulating level proteins involve linear growth glucose homeostasis , include IGF-I , IGF-II , IGF-BP3 , growth hormone , insulin , C-peptide . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease type . Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically correlative laboratory study . Samples analyze IGF-I , IGF-II , IGF-BP3 , growth hormone , insulin , C-peptide level immunogenicity .</detailed_description>
