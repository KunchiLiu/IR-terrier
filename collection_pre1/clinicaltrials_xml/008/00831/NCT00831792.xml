	<brief_title>TKI258 Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : TKI258 design perform several anti-tumor function , include cut blood supply tumor . Researchers think may help slow stop growth prostate cancer . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take 4 capsule TKI258 1 time day 5 day row follow 2 day rest ( Days 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 28-day study `` cycle '' ) . You take TKI258 capsule 8 ounce water least 1 hour meal ( breakfast ) least 2 hour follow meal ( breakfast ) . If want , may take drug meal few 500 calorie 20 gram fat . Study Visits : Every 28 day make 1 study `` cycle . '' On Day 1 Cycle 1 cycle , follow test procedure perform : - Your complete medical history record . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - You ask side effect may experience . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status evaluate . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) collect routine test . This blood also test measure PSA . - You triplicate ECG ( 3 ECGs row ) take study drug . You also 1 ECG 6 hour take study drug . On Day 12 ( +/- 3 day ) Cycles 1 2 , day 26 Cycle 1 ( +/- 3 day ) blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect routine test . Part Cycle 2 blood draw use measure amount TKI258 system . Note Day 26 Cycle 1 visit could end scheduled day Day 1 Cycle 2 visit describe . On Day 1 Cycle 2 every odd number Cycle ( Cycles 3 , 5 , 7and ) , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - Urine collect test marker relate bone . At end every cycle ( Day 26 ) , ECG . Every 3 Cycles ( every 12 week ) , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure level heart enzymes - You echocardiogram MUGA scan like one screen visit check heart function . About 7-10 week first dose study drug , another bone marrow biopsy aspiration perform check status disease biomarker test . CT and/or bone scan perform every 8 week first 6 month every 3 month check status disease . Length Study : You may remain study long benefit . You take study intolerable side effect occur disease get bad . End-of-Study Visit : Within 4 week last dose study drug , return clinic end-of-study visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , weight . - Your performance status evaluate . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - You ask side effect experience since last visit . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . This blood also test measure certain hormone , heart enzyme , PSA . - You chest x-ray , bone scan , either compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan abdomen pelvis check status disease . - You ECG either echocardiogram MUGA scan . - You bone marrow biopsy aspiration perform check status disease biomarker test . Long-Term Follow-up : Once longer study , research staff check every 3 month . This update consist phone call , e-mail , review medical and/or record . You extra test , procedure , study visit . If contact phone , call would last 5 minute . This investigational study . TKI258 FDA approve commercially available . It use study research purpose . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
