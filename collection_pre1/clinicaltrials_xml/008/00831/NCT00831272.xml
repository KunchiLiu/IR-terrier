	<brief_summary>The aim study test treatment outcome difference alcohol dependent subject randomly assign 12 week treatment NTX ( 50mg/day ) placebo among one two copy Asp40 allele mu-opioid receptor compare homozygous Asn40 allele . Thus , design study 2X2 cell double-blind randomization NTX placebo stratify genotype . To meet aim , 150 alcohol dependent outpatient one two copy Asp40 variant mu-opioid receptor 190 subject homozygous Asn40 variant recruit across four participate site .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenetic Response Naltrexone For Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite well establish efficacy naltrexone , significant variation individual response naltrexone . A critical question remain : circumstance patient naltrexone ( NTX ) beneficial ? Recent work center provide evidence mu-opioid receptor ( OPRM1 ) gene polymorphism A118G ( Asn40Asp ) impart significant change treatment response . We show patient 1-2 copy Asp40 variant significantly well treatment responses patient Asn40 variant ( absence heavy drink -73.9 % v/s 49 % response ) . To consolidate knowledge , wish test relationship A118G polymorphism response treatment naltrexone . This work focus subject European Asian descent A118G polymorphism occur less 1 % African descent . The study consist 12 week outpatient treatment 50mg/day naltrexone placebo . Up 340 subject recruit across four site . The inclusion criterion include adult male female European Asian descent DSM-IV diagnosis alcohol dependence heavy drinking per TLFB criterion . Patients major psychiatric disorder psychotropic medication , substance dependence problem ( except nicotine ) , severe cognitive impairment , active suicidal/homicidal thought serious medical condition ( include liver disorder ) exclude . The ultimate aim line investigation establish genetic link alcohol dependence treatment define endophenotype associate treatment response . Based upon promising finding , aim study examine prospectively interaction functional polymorphism mu-opioid receptor ( A+118G ( Asn40Asp ) ) response treatment naltrexone . A secondary aim study examine role Asp40 allele alternate subjective effect alcohol use alcohol dependent individual demonstrate human laboratory experiment . We hypothesize naltrexone - placebo - produce great clinical response 12 week trial subject one two copy Asp40 variant ( `` Asp40 positive '' ) subject homozygous Asn40 allele . Response naltrexone measure reduction number heavy drinking day ( define &gt; 5 drinks/day male ; &gt; 4 female ) 12 week trial . We also expect interaction medication genotype , compare group placebo homozygous Asn40 , Asp40 positive subject randomize naltrexone report less `` high '' alcohol consumption ( Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale ) , low level alcohol crave time ( Penn Alcohol Craving Scale ) .</detailed_description>
