	<brief_summary>The purpose multicenter , pilot , open-label , Phase II clinical trial discover Everolimus ( RAD001 ) safe effective people advance kidney cancer ( renal cell carcinoma - RCC ) . Since 2002 , Everolimus study 2500 patient various type cancer single agent ( drug use alone treat cancer ) combination number well know anticancer therapy . Various study , animal mice cancer human cancer show Everolimus slow growth cancer . Everolimus take pill form mouth daily 3-5 week follow surgery remove effect kidney .

	<brief_title>Everolimus ( RAD001 ) For Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) Before Kidney Removal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Everolimus significantly improve outcome follow prior therapy . This study biomarker drive Phase II trial ass activity everolimus first-line therapy renal cell carcinoma . Following initial kidney tumor biopsy , everolimus administer 3-5 week cytoreductive nephrectomy everolimus resume continued tumor progression intolerable toxicity . Any correlation tumor tissue biomarker change initial biopsy nephrectomy specimen long-term progression-free survival determine . This trial may enable identification factor predictive significant benefit everolimus administer first-line therapy employ neoadjuvant therapy paradigm .</detailed_description>
