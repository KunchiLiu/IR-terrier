	<brief_title>Study Hypofractionated Proton Beam Radiation Therapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy long establish role curative treatment organ-confined prostate cancer . However , optimal radiation dose treatment schedule remain unknown . The use hypofractionation long generally successful history conformal proton beam therapy . Several report detail efficacy safety hypofractionated conformal radiation therapy ( x-rays ) prostate cancer find literature . Hypofractionated conformal proton beam radiation therapy become institutional routine treatment numerous solid tumor . The purpose study determine shorten overall treatment schedule result equivalent tumor control rate increase side effect compare current institutional standard treatment equivalent dose give longer period time .</detailed_description>
