	<brief_summary>The long-term goal proposal provide pre-treatment evaluation assist rational selection patient undergo appropriate definitive therapy prostate cancer . In , may possible improve number percentage cancer patient receive effective therapy cure disease maximize quality life follow therapy . - Aim 1 : To evaluate accuracy T2W MRI , DCE-MRI combine data stag prostate cancer . - Aim 2 : To evaluate accuracy MRI determine tumor volume prostate gland . - Aim 3 : To evaluate accuracy MRI grade prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization Prostate Cancer With 3T MR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In laboratory combine use new 3T clinical magnetic resonance ( MR ) technology , dynamic-contrast enhancement ( DCE ) , unique endorectal-coil ( ERC ) probe order non-invasively obtain image prostate gland high signal-to-noise resolution well spectral dispersion previously achieve . This image strategy acquire higher-resolution image small voxel sizes possible prior MR technology comprehensive tissue sample compare pre-surgical assessment . This methodology make feasible assess prostate-tissue morphology additional feature prostate cancer tissue metabolism , tissue kinetics , vascular microenvironment , thus provide non-invasive tool : 1 ) detect extra-capsular spread , 2 ) detect specific area within prostate harbor cancer , 3 ) determine aggressiveness cancer 4 ) direct biopsy treatment specifically diseased area . In order prospectively validate goal recruit successive patient schedule prostate removal participate protocol . Each patient study ERC MRI 3T use T2-weighted ( T2W ) imaging , DCE 3D T1-weighted image MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) . A pathologist use whole mount preparation independently analyze patient 's prostate specimen . The whole mount data use standard compare observation data obtain 3T MRI finding . Aim 1 : To evaluate accuracy T2W MRI , DCE-MRI combine data stag prostate cancer . Supplementing T2W image high-resolution capability 3TMR , apply standard morphologic criterion use 1.5T determine presence absence extracapsular extension ( ECE ) disease . The possible incremental value high spatial resolution , dynamic contrast-enhanced data investigate . MRI result compare ECE determination whole-mount pathology . Aim 2 : To evaluate accuracy MRI determine tumor volume prostate gland . Using dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI parametric analyse T2-weighted image , small voxel size use previously , approach . Tumor volume determine MRI compare determine pathology . Aim 3 : To evaluate accuracy MRI grade prostate cancer . The enhanced resolution available 3T offer new opportunity compare Gleason grade independent combined assessment tissue kinetics metabolism . Pixel pixel parametric analysis obtain . Furthermore , choline citrate choline plus creatine citrate ratio determine use MRS technique obtain . Single voxel technique first employ , follow 3D chemical shift imaging , latter becomes available 3T . DCE MRS data compare separately combination histologic Gleason score comparable tumor identify whole mount pathology .</detailed_description>
