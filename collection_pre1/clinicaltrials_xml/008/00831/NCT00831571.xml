	<brief_summary>This research study examine often hypersensitivity , allergic reaction , occur patient receive chemotherapy medication oxaliplatin . Hypersensitivity reaction vary transient skin rash fever severe symptom shortness breath , chest tightness , severe allergic reaction affect blood pressure call anaphylaxis . We examine often hypersensitivity reaction occur severe reaction occur . We also examine whether factor place people risk develop hypersensitivity reaction oxaliplatin . In optional portion study , examine whether allergy skin test predict whether someone develop hypersensitivity reaction . Participants develop moderate severe allergic reaction oxaliplatin invited participate additional portion study examine desensitization process . This part study examine whether desensitization process prevent future hypersensitivity reaction oxaliplatin patient previously develop moderate severe hypersensitivity reaction allow therapy oxaliplatin continue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Analysis Hypersensitivity Reactions Oxaliplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants come chemotherapy treatment schedule oncologist . The frequency visit depend upon chemotherapy regimen participant receive . - With visit , participant physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . At visit , routine blood work take monitor participant 's health . - While participant receive oxaliplatin , infusion nurse monitor evidence hypersensitivity reaction . Participants also leave diary record symptom may occur 24 hour complete infusion oxaliplatin . - In optional portion study , participant undergo allergy skin test Allergy Service Brigham Women 's Hospital The skin test do three time point : first dose oxaliplatin , 5th dose oxaliplatin , 10th dose oxaliplatin . - Desensitization method use help person allergy tolerate exposure specific allergic agent . Desensitization medication oxaliplatin involve give medication slowly increase amount , start tiny dos , end full dose prescribed physician . Patients participate part study desensitization Brigham Women 's Hospital Medical Intensive Care Unit ( ICU MICU ) ensure close supervision . Desensitization oxaliplatin involve multi-step procedure oxaliplatin dose start small dos rate infusion increase every 15 minute `` target rate '' achieve . This rate maintain full dose medication infuse . This usually take approximately 6 hour adverse reaction experience .</detailed_description>
