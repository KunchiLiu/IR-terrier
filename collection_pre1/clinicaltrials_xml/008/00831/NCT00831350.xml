	<brief_summary>This study subject retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) specifically look difference outcome patient posterior vitreous detachment ( PVD ) without PVD . Posterior vitreous detachment condition gel-like substance occupies space retina lens eye liquefies separate retina . 20 subject Barnes Retina Institute enrol study . Based pre-treatment ultrasound ( test utilize high-frequency sound wave look inside eye ) , high resolution OCT ( noninvasive procedure call optical coherence tomography check thickness retina ) clinical exam , subject assign one 2 group baseline : Group 1 PVD Group 2 without PVD . Then subject receive monthly intravitreal ( inside eye ) injection Ranibizumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several retinovascular disease show VEGF dependent include retinal vein occlusion , wet age-related macular degeneration , diabetic retinopathy . The role vitreous composition vitreous cavity examine diabetic retinopathy many occasion past clinically felt posterior vitreous separation lead quiet involution diabetic retinopathy , proliferative well pre-proliferative retinopathy . This clinical observation never basic science data support . However , recently show cat eye posterior vitreous separation vitreous cavity much low VEGF concentration cat eye attach posterior vitreous . This may due fact flow oxygen retinal vasculature increase PVD . Vitreous oxygen level inversely associate vitreous VEGF level . As oxygen tension increase , VEGF level decline . This suggest high amount VEGF present eye without PVD perhaps powerful anti-VEGF drug , ranibizumab , may great benefit treat VEGF dependent retinovascular disease . To try answer question clinically , suggest analysis vitreous status treatment naive eye retinal vein occlusion begin ranibizumab therapy undertaken see eye without posterior vitreous separation would achieve great improvement vision return normal retinal physiology compare eye posterior vitreous separation . No study assess PVDs RVO patient receive potential treatment .</detailed_description>

Retinal venous occlusive disease ( BRVO CRVO ) Clear ocular medium adequate papillary dilation permit good quality stereoscopic fundus photography , scheimpflug photography high resolution OCT Ability return study visit Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) lactation . Premenopausal woman use adequate contraception . The following consider effective mean contraception : surgical sterilization use oral contraceptive , barrier contraception either condom diaphragm conjunction spermicidal gel , IUD , contraceptive hormone implant patch . Prior RVO study eye Duration RVO great 6 month Laser photocoagulation macular edema within 3 month Day 0 Patients prior eye treatment include antiVEGF therapy ( within 3 month ) , intravitreal corticosteroid therapy ( within 6 month ) Prior vitreoretinal surgery . Had ocular surgery within past 60 day study eye . Concurrent use two therapy glaucoma . Uncontrolled glaucoma study eye ( defined intraocular pressure &gt; 30 mm Hg despite treatment antiglaucoma medication ) . Neovascular glaucoma Concurrent use systemic antiVEGF agent Has active infection study eye . Inability obtain photograph . Has receive investigational therapy within 60 day prior study entry . Patients significantly compromise visual acuity study eye due concomitant ocular condition . Has condition investigator considers sound reason exclusion ( e.g. , lack motivation , history poor compliance , concomitant illness , personality disorder , mental condition , drug abuse , use neuroleptic , physical social condition predict difficulty longterm followup ) . Has allergy fluorescein sodium dye . Inability comply study followup procedure .</criteria>
