	<brief_summary>The purpose study test new monitoring technology use sound depress person 's speech ass severity depression symptom . The Vocal Social Signals Platform ( VSSP ) software analyze non-verbal characteristic person 's speech . This study test software see could useful measurement tool assess depression symptom . Participation study require come research headquarters twice three-month period . The first visit determine eligibility . Throughout study , participant connect telephone system five time , answer question depression symptom . After answer question , voice record use structure speech sample participant read loud . The participant also give unstructured speech sample , involve describe typical day last movie s/he saw . The voice sample analyze compare result depression symptom questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Conversation Acoustic Signals Measuring Depression Severity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conduct 24-month study include test-retest reliability , criterion validity sensitivity change measurement novel monitor technology might provide objective measure monitor depression symptom . There randomization control experimental group reliability/validity study measurement tool . In order evaluate technological measure psychometric property , recruit 60 subject recently diagnose depression . We recruit recently diagnose patient maximize likelihood person improve depressive severity study . Even though subject refer clinician depress patient use CES-D Centers Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale confirm depressive symptom patient . CES-D PHQ-9 screener . We also recruit 20 non-depressed subject ( also screen CES-D ) . This do validate ability VSSP discriminate non-depressed individual individual present depressive symptomatology . The subject depression recruit Boston Medical Center 's ( BMC ) Psychiatry Clinic well BMC 's two primary care practice . The non-depressed individual recruit post ad Boston Metropolitan area daily newspaper . We administer combine TLC-VSSP subject 5 time three month period . This mean subject receive TLC-PHQ-9 5-time encounter study . The time interval five evaluation session 1 , 3 , 4 , 4 week respectively . The first two data collection point include test-retest reliability TLC-PHQ9 VSSP . The third , fourth fifth data collection point include follow-up assessment detect change . In addition , first last data collection include evaluation criterion validity VSS administration Inventory Depressive Symptomatology ( IDS ) human professional ( Validity ) . The first last data collection also use assess ability VSSP , TLC-PHQ9 combination detect change severity depression ( measured IDS ) . The first last evaluation conduct research headquarters intermediate evaluation occur telephone . The IDS interview tape-recorded conduct researcher . Another researcher listen sample tape throughout study ass interviewer¿s fidelity IDS clinician administration protocol 30 item score questionnaire independently interviewer . In addition , subject provide ¿structured¿ ¿unstructured¿ voice sample random order assessment point . Baseline Visit 2 Visit 3 Visit 4 Visit 5 ( telephone ) ( telephone ) ( telephone ) Week 0 Week 1 Week 4 Week 8 Week 12 We design study 5 data collection point order observe change symptom severity level intermediate point final assessment visit 5 . We expect majority patient type treatment , either receive antidepressant medication regimen form therapy ( concern specific type treatment ) . It report approximately 60 % patient antidepressant medication respond treatment . Thus , anticipate certain improvement depressive symptom among substantial proportion subject take antidepressant . We also aware subject treat antidepressant may experience side-effects . We estimate approximately 15 % patient antidepressant might discontinue treatment due significant side-effects lack efficacy . In addition , subject may completely adherent medication and/or therapy regimen variety reason . These factor make possible explore change symptom severity two different direction improvement deterioration . We collect information event ( treatment , stop treatment , non-adherence adherence mediation taking , miss therapy session , etc . ) provide subject diary ask write treatment related event diary . The diary include specific question possible event treatment regimen .</detailed_description>
