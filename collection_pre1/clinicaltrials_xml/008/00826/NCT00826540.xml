	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give sorafenib together bevacizumab work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Sorafenib bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving sorafenib together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate proportion patient progression-free 3 month ( historic comparison result single-agent bevacizumab ECOG 3200 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Response rate ( RR ) II . Overall survival ( OS ) III . Safety IV . Feasibility OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally twice daily day 1-5 8-12 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study treatment laboratory biomarker pharmacogenetic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
