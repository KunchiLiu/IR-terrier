	<brief_title>Trans Sodium Crocetinate ( TSC ) Study Intra-tumoral Oxygen Concentration , Safety , Pharmacokinetics Patients With High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In open-label , one-site study , 48 patient high grade glioma ( HGG ) undergo biopsy partial debulking tumor part standard care oxygen monitoring probe place residual tumor tissue . Oxygen level tumor tissue measure prior administer single bolus injection TSC . Safety assessments occur throughout trial , include 7 14 day follow-up visit . Pharmacokinetic assessment perform prior first 24 hour TSC dosing .</detailed_description>
