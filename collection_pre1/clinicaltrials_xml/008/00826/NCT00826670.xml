	<brief_summary>Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases ( hereafter call ESBLs ) emerge important cause bloodstream infection hospitalize patient urinary tract infection community . As case multidrug-resistant organism chronic colonization frequent , case ESBLs mostly intestinal urinary carriage . To investigator knowledge randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial perform study efficacy systematic ESBL eradication strategy . Eradication ESBL carriage would cause benefit individual patient - reduce risk infection - community - reduce transmission . Even eradication turn impossible , transient suppression ESBL might reduce likelihood transmission thus still beneficial ecologic perspective . The purpose propose study test hypothesis administration 10 day course oral antibiotic active ESBLs lead decolonization ESBL carriage hospitalize patient .</brief_summary>
