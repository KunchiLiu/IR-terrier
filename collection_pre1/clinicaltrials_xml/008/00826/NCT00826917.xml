	<detailed_description>Conventionally volume measurement make use multiplanar VOCALTM ( Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis ) . Recently , new technique , XI VOCALTM ( eXtended Imaging VOCAL ) describe . Combined inversion mode , measurement liquid-filled structure also make . The potential use clinical diagnosis prediction pathology volume measurement particularly first trimester yet investigate . 3D ultrasound find superior 2D parameter volumetry measurement . However , currently , still study do evaluate potential use volumetry measurement clinical practice , especially validity reproducibility XI VOCALTM ; variation result obtain within different ultrasound machine . Due potential use volumetry measurement clinical practice , accuracy volumetry measurement important development new technique need fully explore benefit fully use contribution clinical practice . So far research do evaluate difference result obtain different ultrasound machine , particularly volumetry measurement . This important significant difference result difference machine , accumulate result machine study , include variety sample . Furthermore , much easy compare result one machine another similar study . Both Voluson 730 Accuvix use widely research study 3D volumetry comparison result obtain two machine do . We know whether result generate one machine extrapolate machine clinical research purpose . Thus research need do area . Thus , study carry evaluate potential use new modality XI VOCALTM volumetry measurement regular irregular shape object , comparison result obtain different widely use machine , potential use volumetry measurement prediction common important clinical pathology αº-thalassemia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For objective 1 2 Samples recruit prenatal diagnostic clinic Ysan Yuk Hospital 1114 week ' gestation . They come routine scan refer general antenatal clinic hospital pregnancy risk homologous alphaº thalassaemia . For objective 3 Recruitment except sample obtain normal pregnancy . For objective 4 Recruitment . However , study divide intervention group control group . For intervention group , data collect pregnancy risk homozygous αºthalassemia control group , data collect normal pregnancy . If woman refuse participate study Patients coexist illness</criteria>
