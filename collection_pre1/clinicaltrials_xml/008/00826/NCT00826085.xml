	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study ThermoDox With Approved Hyperthermia Treatment Breast Cancer Recurrence Chest Wall</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common malignancy woman United States world . Despite variety hormonal , cytotoxic biologic approach , significant number tumor recur chest wall axillary area follow primary treatment . Any local recurrence breast cancer mastectomy generally regard poor prognostic indicator . However , also generally agree present without measurable metastatic disease time loco-regional recurrence ( LRR ) favorable disease may experience long-term survival . Overall 35 % woman operable breast cancer experience isolate LRR follow primary treatment . Patients LRR suffer disfigure tumor clinical sign symptom include pain , lymphedema limit range motion affect extremity , foul-smelling wound , visual reminder tumor progression . Up 40 % patient undergoing mastectomy primary treatment experience recurrence chest wall overlie skin ( RCW ) . For initial curative intent LRR , available intervention include surgical resection patient whose tumor clinical status permit anesthesia surgical removal , radiation therapy patient whose tumor clinical status permit additional radiation , systemic hormonal and/or cytotoxic chemotherapy patient whose tumor sensitive drug combination aforementioned . For unresectable LRR tumor , radiation chemotherapy use manage disease . In set success achieve ; however , patient reoccurs follow treatment often treat palliative intent . Diathermy refers therapeutic generation local heat body tissue high-frequency electromagnetic radiation , electric current , ultrasonic wave . In mild hyperthermia local tissue temperature restrict range 39-45°C . Two type external device , microwave system ultrasound system , approve FDA deliver mild hyperthermia chest wall . Mild hyperthermia either microwave ultrasound device use safely breast cancer treatment . In conjunction external beam radiation , type device use heat chest wall device demonstrate enhanced effect compare radiation therapy without additional hyperthermia . Doxorubicin hydrochloride cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic . The recommended single-agent dose doxorubicin HCl ( Adriamycin® ) injection 60 75 mg/m2 intravenously ( IV ) three-week cycle . Acute myelosuppression long term , cumulative , cardiotoxicity ( congestive heart failure ) dose-limiting . Doxorubicin active breast cancer single agent use drug multi-agent chemotherapy regimen . In LRR breast cancer , single agent doxorubicin achieve response rate comparable combination chemotherapy . Lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin ( ThermoDox® ) temperature sensitive liposomal drug delivery system selectively accumulate tumor result leaky vasculature . During ThermoDox/hyperthermia therapy , tumor heat locally rest body remain normal temperature . When liposome encounter temperature 39.5°C , release doxorubicin locally heat area . Liposomal doxorubicin administer intravenously , particulate , eventually remove circulation reticuloendothelial system liver spleen . Pharmacokinetic data liver cancer patient treat radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) ThermoDox show major portion exposure ThermoDox ( 95 % liposomal doxorubicin plasma AUC0-∞ ) occur first six hour follow infusion , establish time period optimal application hyperthermia . Animal study repeatedly show high tumor doxorubicin concentration enhance tumor cell kill ThermoDox combine hyperthermia compare doxorubicin without hyperthermia .</detailed_description>
