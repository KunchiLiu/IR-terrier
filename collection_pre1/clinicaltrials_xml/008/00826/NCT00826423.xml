	<detailed_description>The goal pilot study assess safety efficacy short course ( 3 month ) multiple drug antimicrobial therapy adult MAC pulmonary disease associate multifocal bronchiectasis multiple small nodule . We propose evaluate clinical radiographic response , ass whether macrolide ( either Clarithromycin Azithromycin ) resistance develop , assess quality life measure . No evidence efficacy require proceed long term study ; however , need confirm lack development macrolide resistance pilot study proceed additional study evaluate efficacy short course MAC treatment . Once demonstrated feasibility short course therapy confirm resistance macrolides develop , hope apply external funding support long term randomize control trial compare `` standard '' MAC therapy ( usually consist period eighteen twenty-four month least three antimicrobial ) short course ( three month ) MAC antimicrobial treatment , alternate year nine month non-MAC bronchial hygiene measure two consecutive year . If large study confirms efficacy approach , would propose even large multi-site study test hypothesis short course MAC therapy alternate every year non-MAC bronchial hygiene therapy consider adult patient MAC pulmonary disease associate multifocal bronchiectasis multiple small nodule throughout life . The long term goal research develop optimal treatment strategy patient ( MAC likely persist indefinitely ) result well quality life , less evidence long term lung damage , less risk drug-related morbidity , well tolerate patient compare current treatment strategy . The specific aim pilot study follow : Primary Aim : 1 . Confirm macrolide ( either Clarithromycin Azithromycin ) resistance develop result short course treatment . Secondary Aims : 2 . Assess change quality life metric ( St. George Respiratory Questionnaire SF 12 ) baseline conclusion study period ( six month ) . We expect see improvement quality life measure result short course treatment trial . 3 . Assess change pulmonary function baseline conclusion study period . We expect see improvement particularly FEV1 , FEV1/FVC , diffuse capacity carbon monoxide result short course treatment trial . 4 . Assess change high resolution computerize tomography ( HRCT ) chest , evidence MAC pulmonary disease ( multifocal bronchiectasis associate multiple small nodule ) baseline conclusion study period . We anticipate able demonstrate improvement HRCT evidence MAC lung disease short period trial since change usually occur quite slowly .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All patient must meet diagnostic criterion nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease per ATS/IDSA Official Statement ( AJRCCM Vol 175 pp 367416 , 2007 ) 2 . Confirmation chest radiologist investigator multifocal bronchiectasis multiple small nodule HRCT scan chest 3 . Repeatedly positive sputum culture and/or bronchial washing MAC ( accordance microbiologic diagnostic criterion outline American Thoracic Society ) 4 . MAC must prove macrolide ( either Clarithromycin Azithromycin ) sensitive onset study 5 . Age great 18 6 . No active treatment MAC lung disease within past two year 7 . Patients physician must willing discontinue nonMAC antimicrobial may use part prestudy bronchial hygiene program . 1 . History Cystic Fibrosis HIV disease 2 . Known allergy intolerance propose antibiotic 3 . Inability return three month interval test six month study period 4 . Inability complete quality life questionnaires 5 . Pregnancy 6 . Presence abnormality baseline ophthalmological examination would preclude use ethambutol . 7 . Coexistence nontuberculous mycobacteria MAC</criteria>
