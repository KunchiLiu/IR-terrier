	<brief_title>Trial Using 125I Embedded Stent Patients With Advanced Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer rank fourth lead cause death cancer China sixth worldwide . Although prognosis surgical resection esophageal cancer improve , 50 % patient inoperable undergo palliative treatment late stage cancer metastasis . Dysphagia predominate symptom patient inoperable esophageal cancer . To relieve dysphagia improve quality life patient , brachytherapy previously utilize . Recently , stent placement widely accept option palliation symptom due esophageal stricture . However , recurrence neoplastic stricture remain challenge stent placement . To combine advantage immediate relief esophageal dysphagia stent placement radiation therapy brachytherapy , novel esophageal stent load 125I seed develop author ' institute . The technical feasibility safety new stent demonstrate adequate healthy rabbit model . The following preliminary clinical study single institute demonstrate long survival time , good quality life less restenosis stent whose conventional stent . This prospective multiple center trial design demonstrate clinical outcome irradiation , stent patient compare use conventional covered stent .</detailed_description>
