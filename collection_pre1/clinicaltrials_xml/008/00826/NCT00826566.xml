	<brief_summary>Nowadays become evident chronic systemic inflammation present patient suffer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The role nuclear enzyme poly ( adenosine diphosphate-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) key mediator within systemic inflammatory process well COPD associate exercise intolerance muscle weakness could recently identify . The attenuate effect dietary ingredient PARP inhibit activity systemic inflammation support data vitro vivo study , group well lab . We identify several caffeine metabolite potent inhibitor abundant PARP-isoform PARP-1 in-vitro , animal model well ex-vivo experiment whole blood COPD patient . However , clinical data respect anti-inflammatory effect COPD patient currently available none substance . Therefore , current clinical pilot study intend establish first time clinical data ( proof principle ) anti-inflammatory potential caffeine metabolite .</brief_summary>
