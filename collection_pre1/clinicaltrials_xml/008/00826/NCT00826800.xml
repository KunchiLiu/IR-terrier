	<brief_summary>The purpose study see give chemo-therapy colon cancer surgery shrink cancer lead high rate cure operate first give chemotherapy . Standard treatment colon cancer first operate , , tumor advance , give chemotherapy 6 month . However , surgery delay time chemotherapy start , since body need time heal operation . During time cancer cell remain body removed operation may allow grow . Giving chemotherapy first could attack cancer cell right start , tumor site know , also site cancer cell may spread part body . Another possible reason give chemo therapy first might work well blood vessel fee cancer cell intact surgery thus chemotherapy travel directly cancer . This study also use drug bevacizumab , addition standard chemotherapy . Bevacizumab market since 2004 colon cancer spread organ , use earlier stage colon cancer , plan trial , still study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>NOTE : Patients may sign consent register protocol prior completion assessment criterion 6.1.1 6.1.2 , ( assume eligibility criterion meet ) endocolonic ultrasound biopsy may perform study ; procedure may necessary determine TNM stag and/or histopathology ; however criteria 6.1.1 6.1.2 must successfully meet prior patient receive chemotherapy trial . 6.1.1 Clinical T1N12/T2N12/T3N0/T3N12/T4NiN2 adenocarcinoma colon determine endocolonic ultrasound ( ECUS ) perform MSKCC . 6.1.2 Colonoscopy endoscopic biopsy tumor MSKCC disease confirmation correlative study . Pathological confirmation adenocarcinoma poorly differentiate carcinoma primary histology . CT MRI scan ( do within 30 day registration ) Chest , Abdomen Pelvis without clear evidence distant metastatic ( M1 ) disease . Candidates systemic therapy FOLFOX bevacizumab base opinion primary treat medical oncologist . Candidates complete surgical resection prior administration therapy . Performance status ECOG 0 1 . Patients must age ≥18 year . ANC ≥ 1.5 cells/mm3 , PLT &gt; 150,000/mm3 . Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 OR creatinine clearance ( measure calculate ) great 60 ml/min . Primary tumor clearly unresectable . Tumors neuroendocrine histology . Patients tumor require placement endocolonic stent prior treatment initiation . Patients history stroke TIA . Patients history thrombotic episode deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , MI , CVA occur 12 month prior enrollment may consider protocol participation provide stable dos anticoagulant therapy . Similarly , patient anticoagulated atrial fibrillation condition may participate provide stable dose anticoagulant therapy . Clinicians must note high risk bevacizumab therapy amongst patient history thromboembolic disorder consideration participation discretion treat physician . No experimental therapy ( include chemotherapy , radiation , hormonal treatment , antibody therapy , immunotherapy , gene therapy , vaccine therapy , angiogenesis inhibitor , matrix metalloprotease inhibitor , thalidomide , antiVEGF/Flk1 monoclonal antibody experimental drug ) kind permit patient receive study treatment . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period 6 month study . Subjects men must also agree use effective contraception . Note : Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 6 month study manner risk pregnancy minimize . WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal [ define amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month ; woman hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35mIU/mL ] . Even woman use oral , implanted injectable contraceptive hormone mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy practice abstinence partner sterile ( e.g. , vasectomy ) , consider child bear potential . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour prior start study medication . Women pregnant breast feeding . Note : woman positive pregnancy test enrollment prior study drug administration remove study . Patients concurrent medical psychiatric condition disease , investigator 's judgment , would make patient inappropriate entry study . Patients history past five year prior malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer situ cervical cancer .
