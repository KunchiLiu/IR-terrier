	<brief_title>The Effect Short Term Amiodarone Treatment After Catheter Ablation Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common cardiac arrhythmia , associate increased mortality morbidity due increase risk stroke , poor quality life risk develop heart failure . Today , catheter ablation become standard procedure treatment symptomatic atrial fibrillation , far official recommendation regard use antiarrythmic drug procedure . Nevertheless , common standard practice prescribe antiarrhythmic drug first 2-3 month intervention prevent early recurrence . To knowledge , effect antiarrythmic drug follow ablation atrial fibrillation evaluate recent study . None evaluate long term effect short term antiarrythmic drug treatment . In addition , none trial conduct placebo-controlled . In study patient paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation consider randomisation . Following ablation procedure , patient randomize receive either amiodarone placebo period 8 week . Clinical visit include physical exam , 12 lead ECG record blood sample , schedule follow-up time . Furthermore patient evaluate Quality Life questionaires Holter monitoring . The primary endpoint study freedom atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter atrial tachycardia 6 month follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients symptomatic paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation undergo catheter ablation atrial fibrillation . ( persistent episode may last 12 month ) Contraindication intolerance amiodarone . Prolonged amiodarone treatment within 3 month plan ablation procedure . Previous participation study . Other cardiac arrythmias ( patient coexist atrial flutter include ) . Antiarrhythmic treatment indication atrial fibrillation ( atrial flutter ) . Heart failure ( NYHA class III IV leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35 % ) . Significant heart valve disease . Significant lung disease , thyroid dysfunction liver disease . Inability unwillingness treat anticoagulation study . Females birth give potential Failure give inform concent .</criteria>
