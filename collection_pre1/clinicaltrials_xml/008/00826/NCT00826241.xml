	<brief_title>Dose-Dense Temozolomide + Lapatinib Recurrent Ependymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Temozolomide design kill cancer cell damage DNA ( genetic material cell ) . This could cause tumor cell die . Lapatinib design prevent slow growth cancer cell block protein inside cancer cell , call Her2/neu receptor epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , every day , take lapatinib mouth day morning . You take lapatinib 1 hour 1 hour eating , least 1 cup ( 8 oz . ) water . On Days 1-7 15-21 cycle , take temozolomide mouth 1 time day . You start take low dose temozolomide first 2 cycle , take high dose Cycles 3 beyond tolerate treatment . It take least 2 hour 2 hour eat 1 cup ( 8 oz . ) water . You swallow temozolomide and/or lapatinib whole , one right , without chew either study drug . If vomit take temozolomide lapatinib , take capsule next schedule dose . You report miss pill trouble take pill study doctor . Your study doctor give form ( patient diary ) fill keep track treatment . You ask return complete diary pill bottle visit doctor . Each study `` cycle '' 28 day . Study Visits : Every 2 week , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test check blood 's ability clot . Every 8 week , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You neurological exam . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . - You complete quality life questionnaire . - You MRI scan check status disease . - You either MUGA scan ( doctor think need ) echocardiogram . Length Study : You study treatment 2 year . You take study treatment early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . After study , may able continue take lapatinib long doctor think best interest . Your doctor discus . End-of-Study Visit : After go study treatment , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . - You neurological exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test check blood 's ability clot . - You complete questionnaire . - You MRI scan check status disease . - You either MUGA scan ( doctor think need ) echocardiogram . Long-Term Follow-up Visit : If go treatment ( complete maximum 24 month study drug treatment ) stable disease response , MRI scan check status disease every 2 month first year study , every 3 month second year , every 4 month third year , every 6 month . If continue take lapatinib complete 24 month study treatment , clinic visit MRI scan check status disease every 2 month long doctor think need . At clinic visit , ask . If go study treatment disease get bad experienced intolerable side effect , end-of-study visit , study staff call every 3 month check . Each phone call take 5 minute . This investigational study . Temozolomide FDA approve commercially available treatment tumor nervous system . Lapatinib FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer . However , lapatinib FDA approve treatment brain tumor . The use lapatinib temozolomide treatment brain tumor spinal tumor investigational . Up 50 patient take part multicenter study . Up 30 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
