	<brief_title>Evaluation Solifenacin Treatment OAB Symptoms Patients Who Have Successfully Undergone GreenLight Photoselective Vaporization Prostate ( PVP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstruction urinary tract secondary benign prostatic hyperplasia result obstructive irritative urinary symptom . In last year , photovaporization prostate emerge popular teatment problem . This outpatient procedure use GeenLight KTP laser manufacture Laserscope vaporize obstruct aspect prostatic urethral tissue create central cavity . After obstruction relieve , uncommon patient leave irritative symptom frequency , urgency nocturia , either procedure short-term due change develop bladder due long-standing obstruction . Clinical experience procedure indicate mechanical obstruction prostate relieve , medical therapy antimuscarinic agent able alleviate irritative urinary symptom without risk urinary retention . By add solifenacin early post operative period ( 2-12 week ) subset patient still experience irritative symptom , improvement bladder symptom achieve .</detailed_description>
