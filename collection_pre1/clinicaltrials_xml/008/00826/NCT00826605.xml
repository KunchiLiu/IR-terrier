	<brief_title>Urobilinogen , Maternal Weight Loss Impending Parturition Term</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale/Background : This study retrospective review record examine possibility two marker onset active labor ( contraction result change uterine cervical dilatation ) routine clinical prenatal assessment . The marker question elevation urobilinogen routine dipstick slight maternal weight loss . An apparent clinical correlation presence urobilinogen , maternal weight loss onset active labor observe patient population . Our hypothesis marker term gravida indication delivery within week appearance routine prenatal evaluation . Should correlation exist , clinician would relatively inexpensive way identify patient could deliver within week could possibly predict patient would success induction , normal labor process may begin . The purpose study , , search exist clinic hospital record answer follow two question : ( 1 ) Do pregnant woman least 37 week gestation increase urobilinogen urine dipstick prenatal appointment statistically significant short average time go active labor negative counterpart ? ( 2 ) Do pregnant woman least 37 week gestation show modest weight loss two prenatal appointment statistically significant short average time go active labor counterpart lose weight ? In human , signal initiate labor completely understood . While many theory explore , exact pathway yet determine . Urobilinogen form conversion conjugate bilirubin intestine bacteria . A fraction urobiliogen reabsorb bloodstream filter kidney , become colorless component urine . Normally , 1-4 mg urobilinogen excrete urine per day . Hemolytic process , hepatocellular damage , cholestasis elevate urobilinogen urine . Routine dipstick test normal urobilinogen range 0.2 1 mg/dl ( 1 ) . In study , examine urine dipstick increase change urobilinogen level within last two prenatal appointment prior delivery . No previous study could locate regard link elevation urobilinogen and/or minor maternal weight loss parturition , labor , onset . There study suggest rationale clinical observation , however . Estrogens progesterone play role growth contractility uterine myometrial cell . Progesterone tend promote uterine relaxation , hence name `` pro-gestâ€¦ '' . In specie , progesterone level dramatically fall , 'withdrawal ' , prior onset labor . However , human high level primate , progesterone estrogen level elevate later gestation parturition . The `` withdrawal '' human , therefore , may mediate change myometrial responsiveness progesterone ( 2 ) . Estrogens induce myometrial contractility . Estriol abundant estrogen pregnancy produce placenta . It first appear approximately ninth week gestation last menstrual period ( 3 ) . Plasma concentration estrogen increase throughout gestation along estrone estradiol ( 3,4,5 ) . In week precede parturition , concentration estriol dramatically increase continue rise birth ( 6 ) . Estriol 's role include prepare uterine tissue contraction possibly signal parturition high primate human ( 3,4,7,8,9,10 ) . A rise estriol , monitor saliva , show precede parturition , regardless whether labor begin preterm , term , postterm ( 11,12 ) . Estrogens ' effect liver study extensively . The active transport biliary component canaliculi impaired estrogen ( 13 ) . The pregnant state cause change bile acid production secretion , presumably due high level estrogen , also progesterone 's effect GI motility . This lead mild subclinical cholestasis . Studies show conflict evidence whether increase bile acid level pregnancy . As estrogen increase know induce cholestasis , urobilinogen level increase cholestasis , hypothesis increase estrogen level within last week pregnancy may slow clearance bile even yield rise urobilinogen level notice routine dipstick . An depth literature review perform effort find correlation maternal weight loss onset labor . No support literature validate explained clinical observation . Methodology This study retrospective chart review eligible patient present labor delivery Oklahoma State University Medical Center date January 1 , 2002 December 31 , 2006 . We select particular time period chart review , recent enough accessible , estimate yield usable data 200 woman . The study population include mother age 18 34 year age single intrauterine pregnancy 37 week 41 week gestational age . ( Both young mother woman 35 old increase risk premature delivery . ) The patient admission diagnosis either active labor spontaneous rupture membrane . Active labor define uterine contraction result change either cervical dilatation , effacement cervix and/or descent fetal head pelvis . This study review chart data collect obstetrical clinic , OSU Obstetrics Gynecology , well OSU Medical Center record . We first search hospital 's record patient admit diagnosis active labor . These chart examine inclusion/exclusion criterion enter study eligible ( later define ) . Once chart obtain , search correspond clinic chart define parameter study . Eligibility Criteria : Our study population consist woman age 18 34 deliver single , viable , term infant OSU Medical Center January 1 , 2002 December 31 , 2006 . Gestational age must great 37 week less 41 week , ascertain certain last menstrual period and/or first trimester ultrasound . The chart must include diagnosis active labor spontaneous rupture membrane , patient must least two third-trimester prenatal checkup OSU Houston Center OB/GYN , include one last two week gestation . We define term infant 37 week gestation great ( 3 ) . Our study population consist mainly Medicaid patient . The ethnic blend study population include Caucasian , African-American , Hispanic , American Indian , Asian woman . We exclude woman multiple gestation , risk preterm labor . We also exclude anyone else preterm delivery . In addition , exclude woman diagnosis liver disease , include intrahepatic cholestasis hepatitis , chronic hypertension , intraamniotic infection , preeclampsia variant , HELLP syndrome , cholelithiasis , inadequate prenatal care , preterm labor , induction labor ( due premature rupture membrane ) . Data Collection Only investigator access patient ' data collection sheet . Individual physician involve care specific patient access patient 's information . All individual compliance HIPPA guideline set forth university medical center . Patient record lock file cabinet keep regular chart patient record department OSU Houston Center OB/GYN clinic . Any information obtain hospital labor delivery chart collect Dr. Harris . It directly transport hospital clinic , keep person time en route , store lock folder transit . The following data collect patient ' hospital record . 1 . Name 2 . Birthdate 3 . Age patient ( year ) 4 . Medical Record Number ( MRN ) 5 . Gestational age ( week day ) /Determined : 6 . Initial sterile vaginal exam result ( normal yes/no ) 7 . Date time admission 8 . Admission Diagnosis 9 . Date time delivery 10 . Co-morbidities , pregnancy complication 11 . Delivery Mode 12 . Indication Cesarean Section applicable Note possible determine time onset active labor , time hospital admission . We assume woman go active , natural labor present hospital within 12-18 hour . The day hospital admission , , serve rough , best estimate onset natural , active labor . The following data collect patient ' clinic record . 1 . Patient 's Name 2 . Birthdate 3 . Age 4 . MRN ( megawest number ) 5 . Date delivery ( hospital record ) 6 . Date first clinic visit 7 . Number clinic visit 8 . Weight first clinic visit 9 . Total pregnancy weight gain 10 . Date last clinic visit 11 . Weight visit 12 . Urine dipstick result visit 13 . Sterile vaginal exam ( SVE ) ( dilation , effacement , station ) visit 14 . Date Visit prior last clinic visit 15 . Weight visit 16 . Urine dipstick result visit 17 . SVE visit 18 . Pregnancy Complications Note 36 week gestation , prenatal visit schedule weekly OSU Clinics . Therefore , unless patient compliant routine visit , natural labor term pregnancy take place longer seven day last clinic visit . No data collect patient chart . Analysis : Data analyze use PC SAS Version 9.1 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . The two component study analyze separately . The weight loss leg study utilize independent t-test effort determine relationship weight loss ( yes/no ) time delivery . For urobilinogen component study , utilize correlation technique ass relationship time delivery urobilinogen level . Significance determine 0.05 level . Confidentiality : All record lab result maintain Oklahoma State University Medical Center , department medical record laboratory storage hospital 's Meditech system . All document link patient name number chart destroy data collection complete .</detailed_description>
