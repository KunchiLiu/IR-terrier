	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety efficacy acupuncture complementary therapy pain medication joint pain associated aromatase inhibitor breast cancer treatment . Breast cancer patient live longer largely due benefit hormonal therapy . Aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) new class hormonal agent block estrogen synthesis postmenopausal woman . However , musculoskeletal pain occur 50 % patient treat AIs often respond conventional pain medication . AI-induced joint pain interfere patient compliance may cause major disability . Therefore , safe effective treatment need alleviate AI-induced musculoskeletal pain . Acupuncture traditional Chinese method medical treatment popular modality treat musculoskeletal pain . Acupuncture involve use thin needle stimulate specific point body lead pain control release endorphin central nervous system . Clinical trial find benefit acupuncture treatment knee back pain . Given lack effective treatment AI-induced joint pain safety efficacy acupuncture , therefore reasonable evaluate whether acupuncture effective breast cancer patient experience musculoskeletal pain related AIs . This randomize control pilot study , twenty participant recruit arm directly oncologist Breast Oncology clinic Columbia University Medical Center . The study include postmenopausal woman age 45 year , currently take aromatase inhibitor treatment early stage breast cancer experience musculoskeletal pain one joint . We hypothesize acupuncture reduce AI induce joint symptom</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This aa randomize , control , pilot study determine safety efficacy acupuncture adjunct pharmacological treatment compare pharmacological intervention alone treatment musculoskeletal pain related aromatase inhibitor postmenopausal breast cancer patient . Twenty participant ( 20 arm ) enrol Breast Oncology clinic Columbia University Medical Center ( CUMC ) . Patients treatment arm receive acupuncture administer twice weekly six week allow take pain medication necessary . The control patient initially receive pain medication alone , cross-over acupuncture arm six week . The primary endpoint study compare change joint pain related aromatase inhibitor breast cancer patient treat acupuncture pharmacological therapy compare pharmacological intervention alone treatment . The primary efficacy endpoint change Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form ( BPI-SF ) treatment . Secondary objective study include change Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis ( WOMAC ) index , dosage analgesic ( acetaminophen , NSAIDs selective COX-2 inhibitor ) consume , quality life measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Breast ( FACT-B ) , blood level IL TNF , frequency severity adverse event accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0 , assessment attitude towards complementary alternative medicine . The primary hypothesis acupuncture conjunction pharmacological treatment decrease joint pain relate use aromatase inhibitor breast cancer patient compare pharmacological therapy alone . This hypothesis test use logistic regression acupuncture ( yes/no ) predictor change BPI-SF score treatment ( six week ) compare baseline outcome . The logistic model allow adjustment possible confounders age , body mass index year since menopause . Secondary outcome include change WOMAC index , FACT-B quality-of-life measure , dosage analgesic consume , blood level IL-and TNF treatment compare baseline . The change efficacy outcome assess patient ( include delay cross-over acupuncture ) acupuncture treatment . For patient receive immediate acupuncture treatment , efficacy outcome reassess twelve week examine duration effect upon completion acupuncture . All treatment-related adverse event report treatment arm . For secondary endpoint , difference baseline , six week twelve week study efficacy outcome measure use descriptive statistic graphical tool . Correlations biologic marker inflammation efficacy measure evaluate tabular graphical form . The study enroll total 40 patient , half randomized one two arm receive acupuncture plus pharmacological treatment ( arm A ) pharmacological treatment alone ( arm B ) . Joint pain assess BPI-SF score baseline six week . All patient baseline BPI bad pain item ( # 2 ) â‰¥3 point scale 0-10 .</detailed_description>
