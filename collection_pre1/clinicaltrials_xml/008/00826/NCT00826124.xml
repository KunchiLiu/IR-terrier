	<brief_summary>Epidural steroid injection ( ESI ) frequently perform procedure pain clinic . When perform ESI , consensus best select candidate intervention , level ( ) inject . Some expert advocate base injection level MRI finding , whereas others recommend clinical symptom . In order determine whether MRI necessary refer patient chronic LBP radiate leg ( ) pain management intervention , perform randomize comparative study involve 131 patient chronic low back leg pain clinically candidate epidural steroid injection two group . Group I receive two ESI base solely historical physical exam ( PE ) finding . Group II receive treatment MRI review . The investigator ' hypothesis MRI significant effect treatment outcome , minimal impact patient care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One hundred thirty-one patient refer Blaustein Pain Treatment Center back leg pain randomize receive one two treatment . Sixty-three patient allocate group I 68 group II ( see statistical analysis ) . All patient candidate ESI base history physical exam . All 63 group I patient receive two ESI base solely history PE ( i.e . treat physician blind MRI result ) . Group II receive treatment base MRI , history PE . This probably may include ESI ( i.e . conceivable normal MRI might result conventional therapy instead ESI , though chemical irritation nerve root often occur without disc protrusion . We estimate occur 10 % case ( probably less ) ; hence , plan randomize 68 patient group II . If ESI do , patient receive two injection , similar patient group I. Randomization do research assistant via computerize randomization system group 13 . In order ensure serious pathology miss group I subject , separate doctor knowledge treatment allocation review film . If serious pathology evidence spinal metastasis infection , patient exclude study . There `` control '' group study . Both evaluate physician patient blind exit study .</detailed_description>
