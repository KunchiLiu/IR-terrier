	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety efficacy D-serine early intervention treatment schizophrenia prodrome condition . This study placebo-controlled trial D-serine symptomatic treatment patient schizophrenia prodrome . Seventy two subject meet criterion schizophrenia prodrome include study , 24 site ( Yale , Nathan Kline Institute Zucker Hillside Hospital ) . The primary outcome measure include symptom neuropsychological measure . The duration study two half year . This research D-serine hold prospect direct benefit patient 's current symptom . Subjects may also benefit close monitoring symptom , , schizophrenic psychosis occur , psychosis recognize treatment may begin minimal delay . This study also could benefit suggest promise lead early intervention schizophrenic prodrome . Overall Design Summary . We propose prodromal patient randomize D-serine v placebo 16 week . To insure subject opportunity receive D-serine , optional 16 week cross-over trial alternate study medication . No subject D-serine longer 16 week . Admission criterion , Assessment Procedures , Study Design across site . The procedure timeline show Table 1 . The procedure timeline initial randomize 16 week trial optional cross-over trial alternate study medication . If patient 's opt 16 week treatment alternate medication , use assessment end initial treatment baseline 16 week treatment alternate medication . Subjects see two preliminary visit , treatment , subject see weekly first 5 visit biweekly thereafter . A safety blood urine collection do day 3 ( 3 day start study medication ) . Vital sign weight , blood draw urine collection safety measure , urine pregnancy test urine toxicology repeat throughout treatment . Adverse effect rating symptom assessment repeat visit . Neuropsychological assessment optional `` Biomarker study '' visual , auditory ERPs task administer one two preliminary visit study endpoint . Any patient convert frank psychosis referred/offered immediate treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1. treatment seek subject age 1335 meet criterion schizophrenia prodrome ( see criterion ) able give write informed assent consent . 2 . Subjects must score least 20 SOPS total score visit 1 . 3 . Patients may receive ongoing treatment antipsychotic , antidepressant antianxiety medication prescribe treat physician , may medication free . 4 . Patients may enroll treatment phase fix medication dosage least 4 week . If possible , medication hold constant course study . Subjects exclude drop study psychiatric diagnosis must start new medication unless diagnosis `` psychosis '' . Medication change increase decrease medication permit discretion treat physician , , occur , treat secondary outcome measure . Exclusion criterion : 1. inability give inform assent consent , 2. history psychosis ( e.g . frank delusion , hallucination , think disorder ) , 3. psychotropic medication begin dose adjust within 4 week visit 0 , 4. contraindication study medication , 5. inclusion symptom well account comorbid diagnosis , 6. treatment need comorbid diagnosis outweigh prodromal symptom , 7. unstable medical illness , 8. female childbearing potential take adequate contraceptive precaution pregnant breast feeding , 9. alcohol drug abuse dependence past three month , 10. either follow : Subjects significant renal disease estimate GFR 60 ( MDRD , http : //www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.cfm ) exclude ( see detail ) . Any subject take unwilling avoid nephrotoxic agent course study ( NSAIDS , ACE inhibitor , ARB 's , calcineurin inhibitor , aminoglycosides ) also exclude . Therefore , patient ask study take acetaminophen ( e.g . headache ) avoid take ibuprofen . For adolescent ( age 1317 ) , stringent renal exclusion criterion adhere : 1. estimate GFR &lt; 89 cc/min/1.73 m2 calculate Schwartz formula ( http : //www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculatorPed.cfm ) , 2. difference â‰¥0.3mg/dl two baseline serum creatinine value , 3. baseline proteinuria define spot urine protein : creatinine 0.2 great , 4. baseline glucosuria ( presence glucosuria ) . Schizophrenia Prodrome Criteria : We enrol Attenuated Positive Syndrome ( APS ) [ 1 ] , Genetic Familial Risk ( GFR ) [ 1 ] Clinically High Risk Negative ( CHR ) symptom prodrome study . A separate analysis do APS CHR patient . 1 . Attenuated Positive Syndrome : One 5 SOPS positive item score prodromal range ( rating 35 ) AND Symptoms begin within past year increase 1 point within past year AND Symptoms occur least per wk last month . 2 . Genetic Familial Risk : First degree relative history psychotic disorder OR Criteria schizotypal personality disorder meet patient AND GAF drop least 30 % last month vs 1 year ago . In experience , patient meet criteria syndrome . 3 . CHR : To make criterion , social isolation must present along either flat affect impairment occupational role . Therefore meet criterion CHR , Social Anhedonia ( N1 ) present score 3 , , addition , one two symptom ( N3 N6 ) list must also present minimum level 3 . Note : score `` 6 '' item consider exclusionary .</criteria>
