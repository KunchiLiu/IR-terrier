	<brief_title>Treatment Study Steroid Injection Physical Therapy Acute Lateral Epicondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Much write lateral epicondylitis/tennis elbow reflect existence many treatment condition . However , consensus treatment give best result . Based late meta-studies review Cochrane Library , one may conclude evidence short-term effect topical per oral NSAIDs . The true manipulation exercise . Corticosteroid injection also show short-term effect , beyond 6 week . Ultrasound possible short-term effect base one meta-analysis . Extra corporeal shock wave therapy seem effective . The treatment acupuncture , orthosis , surgery long-term NSAIDs support literature , impossible draw conclusion effect absence thereof . In fact , scant support long-term treatment literature . We find two study special interest ( see citation ) . Both do primary care set one-year follow . One study compare corticosteroid injection physical therapy ( ultrasound , manipulation exercise ) wait-and-see group . The compare corticosteroid injection naproxen orally placebo-medication . Both conclude corticosteroid injection safe effective treatment pain-relief first 6 week , effect treatment well physical therapy , wait-and-see naproxen orally within time-frame . Physical therapy one study give , statistically significantly well long-term ( one year ) effect wait-and-see treatment . There seem indication corticosteroid injection good alternative first 6 week . We find good reason investigate long-term effect physical therapy . At time , would interest see whether good initial response corticosteroid injection may extend combined physiotherapy . This randomised , placebo-controlled study conduct general practice Ostfold County , Norway include patient age 18-70 year pain recent onset lateral part elbow . After treatment-period 6 week , patient follow total 12 month . Patients recruit interested general practitioner city Sarpsborg surroundings remit two study-physicians make initial evaluation inclusion- exclusion criterion , well treatment , follow-up outcome assessment whole study-period . The patient treat one two study-physicians 6-weeks treatment-period . From 6. week , patient see physician , unaware allocate intervention , registration assessment .</detailed_description>
