	<brief_summary>Approximately 60 patient enrol highly suspected lung cancer , head neck cancer . The patient must also start radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy regimen ( except 5-fluorouracil ) . The patient undergo 3 visit . One screening , one pre therapy PET/CT image visit , one ( 3-5 week start therapy ) post PET/CT image visit . This study evaluate FLT FDG image tumor proliferation rate early assessment tumor response radiation chemo-radiation combo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PHASE : II/III OBJECTIVES : Primary : To investigate clinical value serial quantitative [ F-18 ] FLT positron image assessment tumor proliferation rate early assessment tumor response radiation chemoradiotherapy regimen ( except 5-fluorouracil ) comparison serial quantitative [ F-18 ] FDG image Secondary : To gain additional clinical information experience [ F-18 ] FLT guide design future , pivotal , Phase III trial change tumor proliferation pre-treatment baseline value use early indicator response therapy regimen . DESIGN : Open label , nonrandomized , uncontrolled , single group assignment DURATION : Pre treatment [ F-18 ] FLT PET scan follow clinical [ F-18 ] FDG PET scan follow post treatment [ F-18 ] FLT PET scan post treatment , clinical [ F-18 ] FDG PET scan 4 week ( ±1 week ) monitor radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy . PROCEDURES : Informed consent , collection demographic information , medical history , physical examination , vital sign , 12-lead ECGs , concomitant medication collection , monitor adverse event , pre treatment [ F-18 ] FLT PET scan post treatment [ F-18 ] FLT PET scan SUBJECTS : Approximately 60 patient enrol confirmed lung cancer , head neck cancer . The patient must also start radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy regimen ( except 5-fluorouracil ) eligible . This allow approximately 40 evaluable patient complete study approximately four eight site conduct United States .</detailed_description>
