	<brief_title>Safety Feasibility Algisyl-LVR™ Method Left Ventricular Restoration Patients With DCM Undergoing Open-heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart Failure ( HF ) progressive condition diverse etiologies 50 percent patient present diagnosis define reason develop disease . However , estimate half patient present HF coronary artery disease ( CAD ) primary etiology . The common etiology among HF patient without CAD report systemic hypertension valvular disease . Irrespective etiology , majority patient HF symptom due impairment leave ventricular ( LV ) myocardial function . HF progressive condition result myocardial damage . This damage cause predisposing condition acute event lead cardiac remodeling . The principal manifestation progression cardiac remodel change geometry structure leave ventricle ( LV ) , chamber dilates and/or hypertrophy become spherical . The cardiac remodel maladaptive progression lead worsen clinical symptom HF , characterize limited exercise tolerance edema . Despite optimal medical management , HF progressive nature patient mortality rate 50 percent 5 year . Structural heart abnormality know play central role HF , clinical evidence support strong causal relationship cardiac chamber dilation heart failure . Because dilation , contractile dysfunction , appear responsible severity disease , mitigation prevention deleterious dilation process appear important therapeutic target HF patient . Hence , therapy specifically target progressive LV dilatation remodel reshape reduce LV chamber size may offer important new alternative treatment HF . Algisyl-LVR™ single use , multiple component device development indication prevent reverse progression heart failure ( HF ) provide implant space-occupying material myocardium affect LV shape prevent reverse LV enlargement . The intended clinical benefit Algisyl-LVR™ improve fail heart 's structure function associate improvement patient 's clinical status quality life . Data current study use evaluate initial feasibility novel therapeutic device . The objective pilot study evaluate feasibility safety Algisyl-LVR™ device . No formal hypothesis test perform . Descriptive statistic use summarize operator ( surgeon ) experience patient outcomes . The result study used ass design device feasibility procedure use device . The study also guide design sample size future study . This study conduct several center Europe . The surgeon 's experience use device collect evaluated . Measures safety tolerability Algisyl-LVR™ evaluate analysis adverse experience , clinical laboratory test , electrocardiogram , physical examination , echocardiographic measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Measurements specify time interval compare baseline value obtain prior treatment . Patients evaluate prior procedure , immediate post operative period , , return clinic 8 day , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month , 18 month 24 month procedure follow-up evaluation .</detailed_description>
