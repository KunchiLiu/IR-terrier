	<brief_title>A Study MORAb-004 Subjects With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MORAb-004 monoclonal antibody direct endosialin , cell surface glycoprotein , express cell involve tumor vasculature . Studies find endosialin play key role tumor growth neovessel formation numerous cancer type include ( limited ) renal , breast , colon , pancreatic , lung , endometrial , ovarian , melanoma , sarcoma , neuroectodermal tumor . Preclinical pharmacological study show MORAb-004 potentially useful anti-cancer agent . This clinical trial perform determine safety MORAb-004 subject solid tumor , well establish serum pharmacokinetics antibody , assess tumor antigen may serve predictor response MORAb-004 . Study Part 2 add enroll subject specific histological diagnosis ( colorectal cancer soft tissue sarcoma ) characterize safety tolerability 5 dose level MORAb-004 previously test dose escalation Part 1 .</detailed_description>
