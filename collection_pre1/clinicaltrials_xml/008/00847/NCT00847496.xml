	<brief_title>Awbat Versus Biobrane Partial Thickness Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently `` best cover '' standard `` approve care '' treat partial thickness burn . Several option available ; however , shortcoming . The application topical antimicrobial dressing time consume regular dressing change often associate pain . Homograft cadaver skin often unavailable great shortage skin transplant . Biobrane® , biosynthetic wound dress construct silicone film nylon fabric partially imbed film , available use institute many year skin substitute . It show reduce pain number necessary dressing change , significantly reduce healing time ( 1 ) . Its main side effect , although rare , occasional occurrence infection allergic reaction material . Recently , new product , AWBAT , develop coverage partial thickness burn . AWBAT similar Biobrane® term silicone membrane thickness , structure nylon fabric give dermal substitute strength , use collagen peptide inner side membrane . These peptide use purpose react fibrin wound order achieve good initial adherence accelerate re-epithelialization . The key novelty AWBAT different pore size modality collagen peptide attachment . These two key modification aim reduction mention adverse reaction . The purpose study compare AWBAT Biobrane® cover partial thickness-burn injury . We wish determine AWBAT , use treat partial-thickness burn , would provide good healing , pain control , control infection , short length hospital stay , improve scar long term recovery compare Biobrane® .</detailed_description>
