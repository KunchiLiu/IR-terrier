	<brief_title>Pressure Ulcer Prevention Ventilated Patients Using Two Repositioning Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pressure ulcer ( PUs ) pose major healthcare challenge associate increase risk infection sepsis , long hospital stay , high hospitalization cost . Their reported incidence critical care patient vary widely 1 % 56 % . Therefore important take appropriate preventive measure , often successful less costly treatment establish ulcer . Among measure use pressure-reducing surface reposition strategy protocolized way . Though general agreement critical care patient , include mechanical ventilation must use pressure-reducing surface , enough evidence literature best reposition schedule new , high technology mattress use . The use new technology lead propose reposition less frequent . In clinical trial subject ( time interval turn ) address ( Vanderwee et al , Journal Advanced Nursing ) , conclude turn regimen every 4 hour equally effective 2-hour turning , use kind mattress . Nonetheless study make critically ill patient , risk factor develop PUs , reason don´t share finding recommendation generalize . The study hypothesis patient use APAMs , turn regimen every 2 hour compare 4-hour effective prevention PUs could equally safe . The objective study investigate effect postural turning every 2 hour compare every 4 hour incidence grade &gt; II pressure ulcer ( PU ) patient ICU mechanical ventilation ( MV ) ≥ 24h use alternating-pressure air mattress ( APAMs ) The study open label , randomize , control clinical trial . The main variable incidence Pus grade ≥ II . As secondary variable measure efficacy safety patient register . The study take place 26 bed medical-surgical ICU APAMs . Randomization do 24h-48h beginning MV . The final analysis intention treat .</detailed_description>
