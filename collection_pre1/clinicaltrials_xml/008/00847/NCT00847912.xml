	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) skin cream prevent growth new skin cancer face ear . The cost try prevent skin cancer compare usual cost treat skin cancer . Participants ask part study participant treat two skin cancer within past five ( 5 ) year . At least one cancer occur face ear . Having two skin cancer past 5 year make likely participant develop additional skin cancer future . Exposure ultraviolet radiation sun artificial source tan bed major cause basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Using lotion , cream , gel contain sunscreen help protect skin premature age damage may lead skin cancer . The 5-FU skin cream use study FDA-approved treat type skin cancer spot might become skin cancer . However , 5-FU skin cream never study see prevent skin cancer . This drug approve FDA use study . In study , one half patient use 5-FU cream half use skin cream look identical 5-FU cream 5-FU active drug . Approximately twelve VA medical center work together study . About one thousand ( 1000 ) patient study . The study sponsor U.S. Department Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CSP # 562 - The VA Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) skin , keratinocyte carcinoma ( KCs ) , account half cancer United States , 100,000 diagnosis per year VA . The standard treatment KCs excision lesion , cost US health care system $ 2.5 billion annually $ 100 million annually VA . There proven mean prevent KCs ( except perhaps modest benefit intensive daily sunscreen use ) . An effective prevention strategy would dramatically change way high-risk patient manage could substantially reduce cost care . The investigator ' preliminary analysis indicate saving $ 116 per high-risk patient account total national saving $ 11 million . These finding imply study would pay end 4 year . The investigator hypothesize topical 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) chemoprevention prevent skin cancer surgeries cost-saving . To test investigator propose randomize controlled trial 5-FU compare vehicle control face ears high-risk population . In study , 1000 Veterans high-risk skin cancer define least 2 KCs prior 5 year , least one face ear , randomize 5-FU vehicle control cream , follow 2 4 year . The primary endpoint surgery KC face ear . The investigator also assess cost care , quality life , side effect associate treatment , prevalence number actinic keratoses , skin cancer precursor cause morbidity cost . By target patient high-risk , study focus high-cost patient treatment could improve outcome ( cancer quality life ) reduce cost .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Veteran high risk develop skin cancer define 2 keratinocyte carcinoma past 5 year , least one locate face ears Participants unable speak English Participants KC randomization Participants currently use use field therapy AKs face ear past 3 year . The vast majority field treatment would 5FU cream . The investigator allow recent use therapy apply individual AK lesion ( e.g . cryotherapy ) , use entire area ( field ) study treatment area Participants currently use use systemic 5fluorouracil oral capecitabine ( Xeloda ) within past 3 year Participants know allergy sunscreen , triamcinolone and/or 5fluorouracil . Exclusions 6l0 : The investigator exclude small proportion get KCs special reason ultraviolet radiation exposure ( see list ) , since etiologic difference , associate prognostic difference , could associate biologic difference response chemoprevention effort . These include : Solid organ transplant recipient , renal , hepatic , cardiac transplant patient Individuals genetic disorder associate high cancer risk : basal cell nevus syndrome erythrodysplasia verruciformis xeroderma pigmentosum Arsenic exposure PUVA ( Psoralen plus UVA ) treatment Cutaneous Tcell lymphoma Prior current radiation therapy face and/or ear . Additional exclusion ( 1215 ) : Those , opinion recruiting investigator , high mortality risk randomization ( le 50 % chance survive 4 year ) due co morbid illness metastatic cancer COPD . For woman childbearing potential initial pregnancy test ongoing birth control require participation . Patients know dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) enzyme deficiency self report note medical record ( increase toxicity systemic 5FU , although screen part dermatologic practice part study ) . Patients methotrexate ( constitute 1 % potentially eligible individual ) may severe reaction topical 5FU .</criteria>
