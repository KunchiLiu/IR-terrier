	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux disease recognize common persistent medical problem US adult population . Gastroesophageal reflux disease comprise spectrum acid-related disorder include symptomatic nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease erosive esophagitis . It affect men woman nearly equal proportion , severity intensity heartburn symptom may similar type patient . Dexlansoprazole modify release dual delayed release formulation consist two type granule contain single capsule . This dual delayed release formulation design extend duration drug exposure maintain pharmacologically active level long time period . The purpose study demonstrate participant gastroesophageal reflux disease whose symptom well-controlled twice daily proton pump inhibitor , remain well-controlled switched dexlansoprazole MR .</detailed_description>
