Our research group others find depression recognition treatment appear particularly limit among patient acute cardiac illness , though population may vulnerable deleterious effect depression . We propose project , build successful collaborative care depression management program outpatient setting , address important issue . The specific hypothesis behind propose research collaborative care depression management program successfully adapt inpatient cardiac unit , program lead great rate adequate depression treatment improvement secondary outcome . The follow specific aim capture stepwise goal program : 1 . To determine whether collaborative care depression management program ( 'Enhanced Care ' ) lead significantly increase rate adequate depression treatment compare usual care ( screen feedback ) ( Primary Aim ) . 2 . To assess whether Enhanced Care program lasting impact adequate depression treatment , depressive symptom , health-related quality life , adherence medical recommendation 6 week , 12 week , 6 month , compare usual care .</brief_summary>
