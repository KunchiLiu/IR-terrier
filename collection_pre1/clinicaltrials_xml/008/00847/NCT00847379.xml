	<brief_summary>Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy ( DMD/BMD ) genetic disorder develop boy . It cause mutation gene dystrophin , protein important maintain normal muscle structure function . Loss dystrophin cause muscle fragility lead weakness loss walk ability childhood teenage year . A specific type mutation , call nonsense ( premature stop codon ) mutation cause DMD/BMD approximately 10-15 % boys disease . Ataluren ( PTC124 ) orally deliver , investigational drug potential overcome effect nonsense mutation . This study Phase 2b extension trial evaluate long-term safety ataluren ( PTC124 ) boys nonsense mutation DMD/BMD , determine adverse event laboratory abnormality . The study also assess change walk , muscle function , important clinical laboratory measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2b Extension Study Ataluren ( PTC124 ) Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD/BMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2b , open-label , safety efficacy study anticipate perform 37 site 11 country . The study enroll 174 boy nonsense mutation DMD/BMD participate previous Phase 2b study ataluren ( PTC124 ) ( PTC124-GD-007-DMD , NCT00592553 ) . Subjects receive study drug 3 time per day ( breakfast , lunch , dinner ) approximately 96 week ( approximately 2 year ) . Study assessment perform clinic visit screen , every 6 week 2 visit every 12 week end study . Additional safety laboratory test , may perform investigational site accredit local laboratory clinic , require 3 time course study .</detailed_description>
