	<brief_summary>The purpose research study use two different drug find melanoma might spread remove tissue . We believe tumor cell melanoma first move lymphatic system ( system clear fluid move around body carry white blood cell , much like blood system ) lymph node orderly way . If identify first lymph node receive tumor cell , remove examine . We currently use one drug , call `` technetium-99m sulfur colloid '' detect 90 % first lymph node tumor cell would move . Technetium-99m radioactive compound detect skin special instrument read radioactivity . As part research , would like use second drug call `` fluorescein '' ( Fluorescite® ) see identify lymph node additional one examine . This drug fluorescent detect even skin use blue light . This drug approve Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) injection vein diagnostic aid safely use people many year . In study , inject skin , different use currently approve FDA . In past another drug use , call `` isosulfan blue '' ( Lymphazurin® ) , availability drug currently limit , high risk associate . This study conduct Dr. Robert Andtbacka , Dr. Dirk Noyes , Dr. James McGreevy University Utah . This study Phase I/II do find drug use safely give skin work purpose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The primary goal study evaluate ability intradermal fluorescein detect sentinel lymph node ( SLNs ) patient stage I stage II melanoma . Primary Objectives To determine co-localization fluorescein technetium-99m label sulfur colloid SLNs . Secondary Objectives 1 . To evaluate ability detect fluorescein fluorescence transdermally fluorometer . 2 . To evaluate correlation SLN ex-vivo fluorescent intensity SLN ex-vivo gamma radiation intensity . 3 . To evaluate correlation SLN ex-vivo fluorescent intensity SLN metastasis . 4 . To evaluate fluorescein fluorescence detect SLN fixation histological processing . 5 . To evaluate toxicity safety intradermal fluorescein injection . The management regional lymph node patient clinically localized primary melanoma controversial . An elective lymph node dissection time removal primary melanoma favor many . The proponent elective lymph node dissection base opinion hypothesis melanoma spread orderly fashion primary site regional lymph node systemically . Thus early removal lymph node tumor deposit may prevent subsequent systemic dissemination.1-7 Four prospective randomize trial elective lymphadenectomy test hypothesis.8-11 In trial , elective lymphadenectomy result significant survival benefit . In one trials8 , subgroup analysis indicate elective lymphadenectomy may benefit patient young 60 year age , especially nonulcerated primary melanoma melanomas 1-2mm thickness . Based result , elective lymphadenectomy patient stage I II melanoma advocate result selective evaluation regional lymph node development sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) technique . The sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) concept base hypothesis tumor cell primary melanoma metastasize lymphatic system regional lymph node orderly fashion map lymphatic system identify first `` sentinel '' lymph node receive metastatic tumor cell . This sentinel lymph node become involved metastasis node regional lymph node basis involve reflect pathologic status entire regional nodal basin . Morton et al.12 first evaluate SLN concept patient stage I melanoma . In study 237 lymph node basins 233 patient , SLN identify 82 % time predict pathologic status nodal basin 99 % case . Since preliminary study , substantial progress make improve standardize technique lymphatic mapping SLNB . Use vital blue dye 1 % isosulfan blue ( Lymphazurin® ) part lymphatic mapping SLNB since introduction . At time operation , 3-5 ml vital blue dye inject intradermally around intact primary melanoma tumor biopsy site . The dye rapidly diffuse lymphatic system carry afferent lymphatic trunk SLN . An incision make drain nodal basin blue afferent lymphatic channel follow first drain lymph node ( ) , sentinel lymph node . With use vital blue dye , SLN identify approximately 87 % cases.13 This leave 13 % patient unable benefit SLN evaluation . Gershenwald et al . demonstrate SLN identification improve 87 % 99 % technetium-99m labeled sulfur colloid combine vital blue dye . 13 To increase detection rate SLNs , two additional technique commonly use : ) pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy use technetium-99m label sulfur colloid human albumin radiotracer 14 , 15 good delineate lymphatic drainage identify multiple drainage basin b ) intraoperative use handheld gamma probe well localize SLN . Currently , use vital blue dye technique combination radiotracer identifies SLN 99 % cases.13 , 16 , 17 Based finding , clinician recommend use combine modality approach consider `` gold standard '' SLN localization patient primary melanoma . Although technetium-99m labeled sulfur colloid add great detection ability , formal study report use alone . Informal observation find one pick radioactivity node blue often one pick blue node radioactive , ideal situation able use two tracer . Although 1 % isosulfan vital blue dye increase detection SLNs combine radiotracer , several drawback . First , dye diffuse throughout operative wound make dissection SLN identification difficult . This especially concern afferent lymphatic channel cut . Second , 1 % isosulfan blue dye associate anaphylactoid reaction life threaten anaphylactic shock 0.1 - 2 % patient undergoing lymphatic mapping SLNB.18-23 Third , recent shortage 1 % isosulfan blue result decreased access compound patient clinician . Thus , great need develop new lymphatic mapping SLN identification technique . Fluorescein orange-red powder compound , designate formula C20H12O5 , exhibit intense greenish-yellow fluorescence alkaline solution . It use extensively surgery medicine decade diagnostic purpose . Topical fluorescein routinely use ophthalmology ass corneal lesions.24 Intravenous fluorescein use vascular surgery measure vascular perfusion25 skin melanoma surgery ass viability skin flaps.26 , 27 Intradermal fluorescein injection use identify pedal lymphatics facilitate lymphangiography.28 This study design look safety efficacy use 10 % fluorescein mix 1:1 1 % lidocaine hydrochloride . Cooper et al . report intradermal injection fluorescein 1,047 patient without adverse reactions.28 In study , `` single immunologic reaction identify . In two patient , local skin sloughing occur injection site due inadvertent administration 3 ; 1 fluorescein-lidocaine mixture rather prescribe 1:1 ratio '' . Dan et al.29 use intramural bowel injection fluorescein 120 patient colon cancer map lymphatics patient colon cancer . Fluorescein able identify sentinel lymph node 97 % patient none 120 patient suffer adverse reaction . We previously show Cy5-cobolamine bioconjugate inject intradermally hind limb pig able identify inguinal sentinel lymph nodes.30 More recently , also determine fluorescein inject intradermally limb pig also able identify sentinel lymph node . Additionally , 1 % isosulfan blue inject location fluorescein , two detection technique co-localizes afferent lymphatics sentinel lymph node . The fluorescent signal fluorescein provide improved detection afferent lymphatic sentinel lymph node compare 1 % isosulfan blue . Moreover , fluorescein fluorescence clearly visualize transdermally enable improved localization sentinel lymph node prior perform skin incision . ( Andtbacka RH , McGreevy JM , Grissom CB et al . unpublished result ) . This transdermal fluorescence may enable elimination radiotracer sentinel lymph node detection . Based finding propose phase I/II clinical trial melanoma ass safety feasibility intradermal fluorescein detection SLNs patient stage I stage II melanoma .</detailed_description>
