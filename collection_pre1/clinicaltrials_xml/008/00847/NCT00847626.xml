	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Azilsartan Medoxomil Combined With Chlorthalidone Participants With Moderate Severe Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According World Health Organization ( WHO ) , hypertension common attributable cause preventable death develop nation , uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure . As population age , prevalence hypertension continue increase broad effective preventive measure implement . Despite availability antihypertensive agent , hypertension remain inadequately control ; one third patient continue maintain control successfully . Although antihypertensive agent effective appropriate dose , majority side effect limit use . As class , angiotensin II receptor blocker generally consider tolerable class antihypertensive agent . TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) angiotensin II receptor blocker evaluate Takeda treat essential hypertension . Treatments essential hypertension commonly include use thiazide-like diuretic , either alone part combination treatment . This study design compare antihypertensive effect safety tolerability azilsartan medoxomil plus chlorthalidone fixed-dose combination product ( TAK 491CLD FDC ) azilsartan monotherapy chlorthalidone monotherapy 8 week treatment . Participants study randomize receive one 11 possible dose combination azilsartan medoxomil , chlorthalidone placebo 8 week period . The total duration study approximately 13 week . Participants make 12 visit clinic . Each participant also contact telephone 14 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
