	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vaccines make gene-modified tumor cell may help body build immune response kill tumor cell . Giving trastuzumab together cyclophosphamide vaccine therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give trastuzumab together cyclophosphamide vaccine therapy treat patient high-risk metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety allogeneic sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) -secreting breast cancer vaccine combination trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) cyclophosphamide patient high-risk metastatic HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer . - To measure HER2/neu-specific CD4+ T-cell response delayed-type hypersensitivity . - To measure magnitude HER2/neu-specific CD8+ T-cell response ELISPOT . Secondary - To assess impact trastuzumab immune prim vivo IHC . - To measure impact cyclophosphamide pretreatment CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell flow cytometry . - To determine time disease progression . Tertiary - To develop tandem tetramer/CD107a cytotoxicity assay HER2/neu-specific CD8+ T cell . - To measure novel T-cell response induce trastuzumab cyclophosphamide-modulated vaccination . OUTLINE : Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) IV 30-90 minute weekly begin day -1 first course vaccination continue completion last course vaccination . Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day -1 allogeneic sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) -secreting breast cancer vaccine intradermally day 0 . Treatment cyclophosphamide vaccine repeat every 27-42 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive fourth course cyclophosphamide vaccine approximately 6-8 month first course . Patients undergo delayed-type hypersensitivity test blood sample collection baseline periodically study immunologic laboratory study . Blood sample analyze serum GM-CSF level pharmacokinetic study immune monitor ELISPOT flow cytometry . Skin punch biopsy also perform periodically analyze IHC . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
