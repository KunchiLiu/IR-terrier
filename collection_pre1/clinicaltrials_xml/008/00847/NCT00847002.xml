	<detailed_description>A pilot randomize trial Flexitouch® adjunctive treatment venous ulcer Objectives To determine Flexitouch® compression therapy system , add standard venous ulcer ( VU ) treatment , result : 1 . Greater complete heal 12 week compare standard treatment alone . 2 . Greater percentage reduction ulcer area 12 week compare standard treatment alone . 3 . Less time complete healing compare standard treatment alone 4 . A great reduction leg volume affect leg Hypothesis We hypothesize add Flexitouch® system standard venous ulcer treatment result 1 ) great complete healing , 2 ) great percentage reduction ulcer area 3 ) reduce time complete healing , compare use standard treatment alone , 4 ) great reduction affect leg volume compare standard treatment alone . Patient recruitment , eligibility , exclusion Patients present clinic venous leg ulcer , judge clinical presentation history , recruit participation research study . For pilot study total 16 patient recruit . Protocol Procedures After verify eligibility administer approve informed consent , patient randomize one study arm ( A B ) . Study patient see one two time per week ( per physician 's discretion ) 12-weeks standard wound care treatment . For group , sustain compression achieve FarrowWrap™ Classic device . This device wear continuously except twice-weekly treatment Flexitouch therapy undertaken ( Group B ) . Group B use Flexitouch home every day ( twice daily ) ; Group A use Flexitouch . Once per week , treatment parameter assessment undertaken describe . Standard Wound Care Treatment Standard wound care treatment include gentle wound ulcer cleanse saline solution visit , maintain moisture balance wound periwound appropriate dressing ( e.g Acticoat , Aquacel Ag , Mepilex Ag foam dressing ) , remind subject importance proper nutrition , leg elevation rest activity , include frequent ambulation ankle range motion exercise day . The FarrowWrap Classic device apply dress achieve suitable compression pressure important component standard treatment . For venous ulcer treatment apply full stretch . The patient give instruction apply FarrowWrap home . Flexitouch System Use Patients randomize Group B provide home Flexitouch unit . They give instruction use twice daily basis . They instruct remove FarrowWrap time use Flexitouch . The Flexitouch System work apply dynamic low-pressure compression trunk affect limb use gentle , rhythmic massage action . The system consist controller unit four eight-port connector garment set trunk leg . The garment place around trunk affect limb connect controller tube harness . The controller inflate deflates air chamber within garment pre-determined pattern assist lymphatics move fluid adjacent lymph node region trunk . The controller inflate individual chamber garment 1-3 second per inflation . Potential Treatment modification The patient 's welfare , determine principal investigator , take precedence study procedure . Any intervention necessary patient 's welfare undertaken necessary . Wound Photography The wound photograph use digital camera zoom capability supply sponsor study . All photograph take camera point directly wound angle camera plane-of-the wound near 90o possible . Flash avoid adequate lighting . The vertical distance wind camera critical distance 20 cm use possible . Prior take photograph , suitable dimensional scale calibration standard place contact skin near , outside wound margin . In case one-dimensional scale , place wound , position along long dimension wound . A suitable calibration standard supply sponsor study . The framing photo include 1 ) complete wound bed , 2 ) small sample surround periwound tissue 3 ) calibration standard scale . The composed image , view camera LCD viewport , large possible still include require element . The camera orient horizontal dimension LCD viewport parallel horizontal calibration scale leg . Wound Tracing After photograph , wound margin trace place transparent grid wound . The grid commercial product ( E-Z Graph ) design purpose . It consist two layer ; bottom layer contact wound upper layer trace do use colored pen . The upper layer grid system 1 x 1 cm square imbed material . After trace bottom layer discard . The patient 's study ID , visit number visit date record space provide upper trace grid . Assessment Leg Volumes Leg volumes right leave legs ankle knee determine . This do use calibrate tape measure ( Gulick-type ) measure circumferences 4 cm interval start malleoulus progress toward knee . From circumference measurement , limb volume determine use well establish truncate cone model together validate software algorithm . Using method wound assessor enters circumference standardize form appropriate volume automatically determine . Assessment Complete Wound Healing At visit wound carefully inspect Principal Investigator presence absence complete wound healing note record . For study , wound heal consider occur wound fully cover epithelium drainage . In addition , visit , study-related case report form complete Principal Investigator document various clinical feature wound note relevant study-related action event . This form embed within password protect software wound descriptor able enter documented simple mouse click . Analysis Wound Areas Related Parameters Wound Areas Photo Images : The digital image wind cod Principal Investigator suitably rename photographic image file unique identifier . He keep record cod file name group , patient , visit date number correspond . A copy image file make stored CD . The CD send scientific advisor work study sponsor . The advisor responsible analysis image , include determination wound area via computerized planimetry subsequent data statistical analysis . The analyst blind actual group image correspond . At completion data acquisition phase study , analyst tell image belong common group , still know common group belong arm study . He thus remain blind subsequent statistical analysis . Wound Areas Tracings : As complementary comparison approach , wound area also assess wound tracing . The analyst supply copy cod tracing . The tracing scan wound area determine computerized digital planimetry previously describe . Areas determine method serve check measurement use backup case ( ) photographic quality inadequate . Leg Volumes : In addition photograph tracing , analyst supply coded electronic copy leg circumference form . This data use determine , extent , change leg volume edema occur , differences parameter group A B . Wound Descriptors : A coded electronic version case report form , contain wound descriptor parameter data , supply analyst . This information use primarily final analysis summarize clinical progression wound .</detailed_description>
