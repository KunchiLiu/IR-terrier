	<brief_summary>The treatment clinically N0 neck malignancy oral cavity controversial . The option include policy `` wait watch '' ( close observation follow-up ) , elective irradiation neck , elective surgery neck ( neck dissection ) . In elective neck dissection , procedure commonly perform modified radical neck dissection-III ( functional neck dissection ) selective ( supraomohyoid ) neck dissection depend site primary lesion within oral cavity . There trial IIb preserve neck dissection cancer oral cavity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgery cervical lymphatic system evolve lot since introduction classical radical neck dissection Crile 1906 , later establish Martin ( 1945 ) . It include removal cervical lymphatic level I-V along removal non-lymphatic structure namely submandibular gland , tail parotid , omohyoid muscle , cervical plexus nerve , spinal accessory nerve , internal jugular vein sternocleidomastoid muscle . The main morbidity radical neck dissection trapezius muscle dysfunction shoulder drop , result pain shoulder dysfunction . The morbidity radical neck dissection cosmetic deformity neck , painful neuroma , increase facial swelling , numbness neck ear . In last three decade , many modification classical radical neck dissection ( modified radical neck dissection ) , describe increasingly apply . The main modification preservation one non-lymphatic structure remove classical radical neck dissection mainly spinal accessory nerve , internal jugular vein , sternocleidomastoid muscle ( Bocca Pignataro , 1967 ) . The reason develop modification functional cosmetic , preserve oncological safety procedure . Much later 1980s , concept selective neck dissection , Lindberg ( 1972 ) Skolnik ( 1976 ) lay important basis , introduce . In selective neck dissection group lymph node remove , , depend upon location primary tumour , likely contain metastasis ( Shah , 1990 ) . The first selective neck dissection introduce supraomohyoid neck dissection , include removal lymph node level I-III , preserve non-lymphatic structure functional neck dissection . Medina Byers prospective study demonstrate utility supraomohyoid neck dissection patient clinically negative neck node ( N0 ) malignancies oral cavity . The posterolateral neck dissection remove lymph node level II-V well retroauricular suboccipital node , use primarily treatment tumour scalp post auricular skin . The lateral neck dissection , include removal lymph node level II-IV , do tumour larynx hypopharynx N0 neck . The anterior compartment neck dissection include removal lymph node level VI do thyroid malignancy evidence lateral lymphadenopathy , combine lateral neck dissection ( anterolateral ) lymphnodes involve . Recently concept superselective neck dissection introduce . It less radical selective neck dissection , remove less number at-risk lymph nodal group . H Coskun ( 2004 ) find IIb preserve superselective neck dissection oncologically safe procedure N0 laryngeal cancer , functional preservation trapezius muscle hence negligible shoulder disability . In study , find even selective neck dissection , degree spinal accessory nerve dysfunction shoulder disability occur result retraction nerve clearance lymph node posterior superior nerve ( IIb ) . If lymph node remove left place , would stretch spinal accessory nerve neck dissection shoulder disability could avoid</detailed_description>
