	<brief_summary>This study observational study analyze biopsy sample collect subject participate Study 3115A1-303 ( NCT00675688 ) . These endometrial biopsy sample de-identified anatomical laboratory send molecular biology lab RNA extraction analysis perform . The purpose study compare specific endometrial gene regulation level mRNA expression sample placebo , bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogen , raloxifene treat group know set gene previously identify associate estrogenization , endometrial hyperplasia , endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>
