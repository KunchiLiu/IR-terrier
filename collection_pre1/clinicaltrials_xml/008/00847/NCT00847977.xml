	<brief_title>Interest Using Balanced Fluid Infusion Early Phase Acute Cranial Trauma Limiting Hyperchloremic Acidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participation study last 7 day per patient . Both solution crystalloids receive MA France ISOFUNDINE , MA Germany pending MA France TETRASPAN , include indication infusion . Both solution consistent recommendation intensive care traumatize brain : iso-osmolar without glucose . The study emergency : resuscitation head injury , plasma crystalloids may delay . J0 : Day Inclusion On arrival emergency operate room diagnosis serious head injury alone , anaesthetist support patient initial phase include patient study . A H0 , hold patient randomization continue rehabilitation lot fluid allocate . If want use macro-molecules , may use HydroxyEhtylAmidons ( HEA ) . Each batch assign patient include crystalloids HEA : witness arm include saline solution HEAfusine interventional arm include Isofundine tetraspan . These treatment indistinguishable provide laboratory Braun . They keep operate emergency readily available , upon arrival patient . If health patient require refill crystalloids emergency even randomization take place , clinician us originally Saline start protocol soon possible soon patient take minute need achieve inclusion . The first biological assessment include determination natremia , kaliemia , magnesemia , ionized calcium , lactatemia albumin , osmolarity plasma blood gas . These strengths Biological standard care traumatize brain . Apart contribution crystalloids , rest therapeutic discretion clinician . The indication monitor intra-cranial pressure sensor intra-parenchymatous left discretion clinician without obligation associate study . As require usual care pathology , patient transfer intensive care . J1 J2 In accordance Memorandum service , basic daily infusion crystalloids ( 30 ml / kg / day ) prescribe patient first 48 hour . The crystalloids use basic input lot assign inclusion . If indication plasma refer hemodynamic boli solute remain free indication doctor take care patient , type fluid use batch assign patient ( Isofundine-Physiologic serum ) , include use macromolecule available lot assign patient ( Heafusine-tetraspan ) . Biological monitoring TBI usually base biological assessment every 12 hour . It include ionograms blood blood gas . On sample without extract large volume blood , collect specifically biological assessment : - ionized calcium , magnesemia , natremia , kaliemia . - lactatemia . - albumin . - plasma osmolarity . No blood gas . Neurological base monitoring request clinician change value either PIC transcranial doppler . The contribution treatment study stop 48th hour , time , inflow fluid pursue accordance wish doctor , type product impose study . J7 exit resuscitation The end study 7th day inclusion ( trauma ) , day release resuscitation precedes 7th day . This end collection clinical data biological weapon . From J2-J7 , treatment record impose study . This simple monitoring period assess future clinical neurological patient .</detailed_description>
