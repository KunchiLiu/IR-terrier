	<detailed_description>Physical therapist use many way treat joint move well . One way take 1-2 second . Another way may take 1 minute . Both stretch seem work , know . Certain change brain spinal cord may cause joint become flexible kind stretch . Right , much information might work people injured ankle . This study find change brain cause well flexibility ankle joint different kind stretch . In study , subject certain kind ankle sprain limit ankle joint flexibility assign 1 3 group . Subjects get choose group . The first group ankle stretch last 1-2 second . The second group stretch last 1 minute . The third group foot hold without stretch . We use machine stimulate brain spinal cord find stretch affect brain spinal cord . The machine send magnetic signal brain , measure much signal get leg muscle use electrode skin . We also use 3 flexibility test find well stretch work . One test subject lie stomach , others subject stand . To start study , subject get brain stimulate . They get brain stimulate one hour later . After second stimulation , subject flexibility test get 1 3 treatment . After treatment , subject get last brain stimulation test flexibility test . We think subject get fast stretch well brain function flexibility subject get slow stretch stretch . To test idea , compare group brain stimulation flexibility test . We also look relationship brain function flexibility .</detailed_description>
