	<detailed_description>Zarnestra® administer 300 mg administer orally twice daily first 21 day 28-days cycle . Tipifarnib treatment stop later day 21 cycle . Subjects receive total 4 cycle treatment . Two additional cycle might administer patient show improvement PR 4 cycle . After test drug 11 patient first stage , trial terminate 1 few respond drug consider effective . If two patient respond first stage , trial go second stage include total 27 patient .</detailed_description>
