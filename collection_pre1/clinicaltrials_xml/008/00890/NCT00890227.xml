	<brief_title>Incidence Proximal Junctional Kyphosis ( PJK ) Long Posterior Spinal Fusion : A Study Comparing Traditional Open Surgery Minimally Invasive Percutaneous Technique Proximal Fusion Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , two different surgical method use treatment problem . One method include open posterior spinal fusion ( large incision open muscle ) ; also know traditional technique . The second method involve open surgery portion spine require fusion except top area , minimally invasive technique ( small incision without open muscle ) use . One possible side effect either method surgical repair condition call proximal junctional kyphosis ( PJK ) . PJK occur form fracture top vertebra involve surgery loss correction spinal alignment achieve , gradual bend forward spine time . In study want compare rate PJK two group patient undergo long posterior spinal instrumentation fusion . People undergo long posterior spinal instrument fusion may join . About 68 people join .</detailed_description>
