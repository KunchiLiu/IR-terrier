	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer major health problem Western society contribute high mortality rate . Treatment option majority patient metastasis limit cytotoxic chemotherapy . The first line chemotherapy contain oxaliplatin recommend guideline . The use antiangiogenic agent , either alone combination therapy may provide alternative treatment modality management patient . Metronomic chemotherapy refers close , regular administration chemotherapeutic drug , prolong period . The advantage metronomic chemotherapy include reduce acute toxicity sometimes surprisingly good activity drug resistant tumor via antiangiogenic effect . Thalidomide agent , show potential treatment hematological solid tissue malignancy multiple myeloma via antiangiogenic mechanism . Tegafur/uracil ( UFUR ) one effective chemotherapeutics report effective antiangiogenic agent animal model metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRCs ) . In present study , investigator try use low dose metronomic schedule thalidomide tegafur/uracil regimen see anti tumor efficacy recurrent metastasis colorectal cancer patient oxaliplatin-contained chemotherapy . The primary endpoint overall response rate clinical benefit secondary endpoint determine progression free survival , duration objective response , overall survival ( OS ) ass safety profile . This prospective phase II study . After checked eligibility criterion , patient treat Tegafur/Uracil ( TU ) regimen . About 34 patient enrol .</brief_summary>
