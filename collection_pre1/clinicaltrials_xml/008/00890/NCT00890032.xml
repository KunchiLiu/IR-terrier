	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate feasibility safety autologous brain tumor stem cell messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) -loaded dendritic cell vaccine adult patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . Secondary - To assess humoral cellular immune response vaccination . - To compare proportion vaccinated patient alive 6 month time surgery recurrent tumor match historical cohort . OUTLINE : Patients undergo surgical resection tumor . Tumor tissue sample collect isolate brain tumor stem cell ( BTSCs ) extraction amplification BTSC-specific mRNA . Within 4 week surgical resection , patient undergo leukapheresis 4 hour generate dendritic cell ( DCs ) . Patients also undergo leukapheresis 1 week third vaccination least every 3 month need generation additional DCs . Patients receive autologous BTSC mRNA-loaded DC vaccine intradermally weekly 3 week monthly absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
