	<brief_summary>Malaria affect around 515 million people year , million die disease . It major problem live affect area well traveller affect area . There great need safe , effective malaria vaccine . The purpose study test 2 new vaccination regime include new malaria vaccine candidate , ability prevent malaria infection . The vaccine different type virus contain genetic information ( DNA ) malaria parasite . This genetic material name ME-TRAP . The aim use viruses help body make immune response malaria parasite . Both virus inactivate unable multiply within body . The first vaccine virus weaken version common cold virus . Such adenovirus occur many strain type commonly infect chimpanzee well people vaccine use strain originally derive chimpanzee . The vaccine call AdCh63 ME-TRAP . The virus Modified Vaccinia Ankara Virus , ( MVA ) , safer form vaccine virus previously widely use smallpox vaccination . The vaccine call MVA ME-TRAP . This study enable investigator assess : 1 . The ability different vaccine combination prevent malaria infection 2 . The safety vaccine combination healthy volunteer 3 . The response human immune system vaccine</brief_summary>
