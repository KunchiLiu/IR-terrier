	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate utility measure coagulation factor activity set acute ischemic stroke , potential marker inherit thrombotic risk . The investigator determine relationship exist coagulation factor , include factor VIII , factor IX , factor XI clinical diagnosis , classification , outcome . The investigator determine significant elevation factor activity independent thrombotic risk factor . Null Hypothesis : There statistical difference coagulation factor , include factor VIII , IX , XI activity level patient acute ischemic stroke compare acute stroke mimic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Factor XI Levels Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased factor XI level associate venous thromboembolic disease acute myocardial infarction . However , check factor XI level currently indicate assess individual thromboembolic risk . Factor XI important protease link extrinsic arm coagulation cascade intrinsic arm dual activation factor XII thrombin . Since thrombin downstream product factor XI , feedback loop create amplifies thrombin production ultimately result formation stable fibrin clot . Sufficient thrombin generation via pathway also contribute activation Thrombin-Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor ( TAFI ) . Activated TAFI downregulates fibrinolysis implicate part association elevate factor XI level venous thromboembolic disease . One study find functional TAFI level &gt; 120 % increase risk ischemic stroke approximately 6-fold , however , association Factor XI ischemic stroke yet firmly establish . We recently perform preliminary retrospective analysis 78 patient stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) find patient factor XI activity level 95th percentile age sex match reference population relative risk 5.3 stroke TIA . Factor XI measurement may able help identify thromboembolic disease , aid determination stroke etiology .</detailed_description>
