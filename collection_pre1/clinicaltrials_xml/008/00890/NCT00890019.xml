	<brief_summary>This open label phase I study , assess safety novel malaria vaccine , AdCh63 ME-TRAP , simian adenovirus encode Plasmodium falciparum antigen . This follow promise phase I clinical study MVA ME-TRAP preclinical study AdCh63 MVA ME-TRAP use together prime-boost regime . All volunteer recruit healthy adult . They prim various dos AdCh63 ME-TRAP administer intradermally intramuscularly . Some volunteer receive booster vaccination MVA ME-TRAP various dos administer via intradermal intramuscular route . Safety data collect eight regimen . Secondary aim study assess immune response generate regime .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study AdCh63 ME−TRAP Alone With MVA ME−TRAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ME-TRAP insert contain fusion protein multiple epitope ( ME ) Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic thrombospondin-related adhesion protein ( TRAP ) . The 'ME ' string 20 epitope fuse thrombospondin-related adhesion protein . TRAP select well characterize protective homologue rodent . We safely administer ME-TRAP 700 volunteer UK Africa . MVA vector prove non-contagious avirulent . Viral replication block late infection cell importantly viral recombinant protein synthesis unimpaired even abortive infection . Replication-deficient recombinant MVA view exceptionally safe viral vector . When test animal model study recombinant MVAs show avirulent , yet protectively immunogenic vaccine viral disease cancer . Recent study macaques severely immuno-suppressed SIV infection support view MVA safe immuno-compromised human . Simian adenovirus use previously clinical trial human . However , active development vaccine HIV , ( GSK ) , HCV , ( Merck ) .</detailed_description>
