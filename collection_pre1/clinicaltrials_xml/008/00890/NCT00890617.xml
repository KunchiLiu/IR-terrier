	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Cryotherapy kill tumor cell freeze . Giving cryotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study well cryotherapy work treat patient primary stage I non-small cell lung cancer lung metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cryotherapy Treating Patients With Primary Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Lung Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate histologic result treat patient primary stage I non-small cell lung cancer lung metastasis neoadjuvant percutaneous cryotherapy ( PTC ) . Secondary - Provide qualitative assessment histology ablation tumor margin , compare histologic observation imaging-enhancement pattern CT PET scan PTC . OUTLINE : Patients undergo CT-guided percutaneous cryotherapy ( PTC ) 2 hour . Approximately 3 week completion PTC , patient undergo thoracotomy consist lobectomy primary lung cancer wedge resection adequate margin metastatic lesion , mediastinal lymph node dissection . Tissue sample ablation tumor margin collect thoracotomy compare imaging-enhanced pattern CT PET scan take baseline PTC . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 6 month .</detailed_description>
