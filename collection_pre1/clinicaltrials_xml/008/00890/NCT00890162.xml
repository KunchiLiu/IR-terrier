	<brief_summary>Background : - Omalizumab approve drug treatment asthma Food Drug Administration . - Researchers study drug double-blind placebo-controlled manner assess efficacy patient idiopathic anaphylaxis ( recurrent hypersensitive allergic episode cause identify ) . - The study improve understand mechanism involve anaphylactic reaction response downregulation ( decrease number receptor surface cell ) mast cell ( resident cell several type tissue ) activation , lead development strategy well prevent treat anaphylaxis . Objectives : - To determine whether treatment omalizumab reduce prevent episode unprovoked anaphylaxis ( acute allergic reaction ) subject history idiopathic anaphylaxis . - To assess pharmacodynamics ( physiological effect drug ) identify patient undiagnosed mastocytosis ( rare disorder cause many mast cell ) . - To investigate cellular molecular mechanism signal effect omalizumab mast cell basophil ( cell leukocyte family release histamine , affect allergic response ) explore regulatory pathway may involve modulation mast cell degranulation . Eligibility : - Patients 18 70 year age diagnose idiopathic anaphylaxis , diagnosis make cause anaphylaxis consider . - Patients document anaphylaxis episode ( mild severe ) least six time within past 1 year period , least within last 4 month , least one following : - Elevated serum tryptase baseline within 2 hour event . - Emergency room visit document anaphylaxis without know cause establish acute onset illness ( minute several hour ) involvement skin , mucosal tissue , ( generalized hive , itch flushing , swollen lips-tongue-throat ) least one following : ( 1 ) respiratory compromise gastrointestinal involvement ( shortness breath , wheeze-bronchospasm , throat tightness , low oxygen level , nausea , vomit , abdominal pain ) ; ( 2 ) reduce blood pressure associate symptom end-organ dysfunction ( collapse , loss consciousness , loss bladder bowel control ) . - Hospitalization anaphylaxis . - Patients must provide letter referral , copy pertinent medical history laboratory test , prospective participant local physician , ability give inform consent . - Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test , must agree practice abstinence effective birth control start protocol 3 month follow last injection study drug . Design : - Participants undergo clinical evaluation , blood test , bone marrow biopsy aspirate . - Participants randomize either drug placebo receive two dos omalizumab match placebo hospitalize , follow continued outpatient therapy , every 2 4 week , 6 month . - Participants remain assigned regimen 6 month experience new onset severe adverse event one occasion within 24 hour study medication relate study drug , whichever come first . At time , participant discontinue drug administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double-Blind , Placebo-Controlled Study Omalizumab Idiopathic Anaphylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anaphylaxis severe systemic reaction cause release mediator mast cell basophil . Manifestations include cutaneous , respiratory , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal sign symptom . Although anaphylaxis frequently attribute exposure specific food , drug , insect venom sensitive individual , causative factor identify 30 % 50 % patient recurrent anaphylactic episode ( idiopathic anaphylaxis ) . Currently , therapeutic option treatment idiopathic anaphylaxis limit variable efficacy . This pilot study examine hypothesis omalizumab ( Xolair ) decrease episode unexplained anaphylaxis patient idiopathic anaphylaxis . Omalizumab approve use asthma . We examine safety profile efficacy omalizumab patient anaphylaxis . In addition , study investigate whether patient anaphylaxis unique molecular cellular defect mast cell result cell susceptible degranulation . The study enroll patient idiopathic anaphylaxis . Patients undergo clinical evaluation , blood test , bone marrow biopsy aspirate . Patients randomize either drug placebo receive , double-blind placebo-controlled approach , 2 dos omalizumab match placebo hospitalize , follow continued outpatient therapy , every 2 4 week , 6 month . Patients remain assigned regimen experience anaphylactic event ( post 24-hr window ) determine unrelated study drug follow 6 month , whichever come first . These unrelated event would determine PI jeopardize patient safety restrict use additional therapy corticosteroid control symptom . After point , patient may discontinue drug administration unblinding . This design ensure patient anaphylactic episode placebo therapy medically indicate . Research study conduct elucidate marker pathways mast cell regulation . The primary outcome reduction number time anaphylactic event randomize phase . Secondary outcome include reduction surface IgE receptor basophil , identification mutation c-kit , evaluation efficacy omalizumab mediator-induced symptom associate anaphylaxis . The study improve understand mechanism involve anaphylactic reaction response downregulation mechanism involve mast cell activation could , turn , lead development strategy well prevent treat anaphylaxis .</detailed_description>
