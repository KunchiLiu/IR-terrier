	<brief_summary>Background : Fluid resuscitation cornerstone initial management critically injured trauma patient yet numerous controversy surround common practice . As result , controversy subject numerous clinical trial , evidence-based guideline systematic review . With publication landmark SAFE Study equipoise 2 treatment ( representative solution colloid crystalloids respectively ) , 4 % albumin saline , establish . This however bring doubt paucity data use hydroxyethylstarches ( HES ) , less costly less side effect albumin , trauma . More recent finding Gruen colleague show much 5 % trauma death result fluid overload base North American fluid management model trauma ( pure crystalloid fluid management ) . A meta-analysis do Kern Shoemaker find supranormal fluid resuscitation crystalloids beneficial give onset organ failure critically ill surgical patient . Balogh colleague find supranormal fuid resuscitation crystalloids apply victim severe trauma , result statistically significant increase incidence mortality , multiple organ failure , intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) . More recently , Kirkpatrick colleague review defined 'secondary ' ACS direct result fluid resuscitation . They conclude `` excess resuscitation crystalloid fluid might harm patient contribute increased occurrence ACS . '' This study serve pilot test hypothesis significant difference clinical outcome patient severe trauma treat colloid ( HES ) plus crystalloid crystalloid fluid management regimen , notably incidence IAH ACS . It hop hybrid colloid ( HES ) plus crystalloid fluid management regimen provide mean avoid untoward fluid overload and/or complication pure crystalloid fluid management costs/complications albumin administration .</brief_summary>
