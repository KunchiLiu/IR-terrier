	<brief_summary>When fever present patient stroke , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , brain hemorrhage , associate bad outcome include large area tissue death , increase length stay , bad degree coma , low ability function , high mortality . Both adult pediatric TBI national guideline state maintenance normal body temperature standard care . However , standard option present specifically guide practice . The current ischemic stroke guideline state fever treat fever-reducing agent offer `` cooling device '' option provide specific guide practice . Over 50 % patient Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) Harborview Medical Center develop fever course stay . With elevated temperature body consume oxygen temperature normal , cause less oxygen available brain . This may lead injury brain cell diminish capacity heal . Thus , temperature management neurologically vulnerable patient prevalent problematic challenge . Based information goal present proposal evaluate 1 ) A standardized , step-wise approach temperature management use Normothermia Protocol successful achieve maintain normal temperature Neurosurgical ICU patient ; 2 ) If maintenance normal temperature associate few episode diminish responsiveness neurological exam evidence measure depth coma , measure Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) compare control group treat accord usual care .</brief_summary>
