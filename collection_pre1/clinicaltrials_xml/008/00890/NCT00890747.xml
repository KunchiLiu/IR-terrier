	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating HIV-Positive Patients With Cancer Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety investigate pharmacological interaction administer sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) subject cancer also HIV positive anti-retroviral regimen contain protease inhibitor and/or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy sunitinib treat non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) define cancer ( NADCs ) subject . II . To detect alteration antiretroviral drug pharmacokinetics due sunitinib . III . To detect alteration immune parameter , include total leukocyte count , cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4 viral load , sunitinib therapy . IV . To correlate variation gene involve sunitinib absorption , metabolism , elimination , include cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A , polypeptide 4 ( CYP3A4 ) , cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A , polypeptide 5 ( CYP3A5 ) , ATP-binding cassette , sub-family B ( MDR/TAP ) , member 1 ( ABCB1 ) , breast cancer resistance protein ( ABCG2 ) , drug pharmacokinetics . V. To explore potential pharmacological interaction sunitinib new antiretroviral agent integrase chemokine ( C-C motif ) receptor 5 ( gene/pseudogene ) ( CCR5 ) inhibitor . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
