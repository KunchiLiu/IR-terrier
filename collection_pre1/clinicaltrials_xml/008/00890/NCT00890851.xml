	<detailed_description>The TUNA know already old technique . There exist , literature , certain number study show long-term effectiveness ( 5 year ) , evaluate IPS flow mictional . This effectiveness slightly low endoscopic resection prostate . This technique present disadvantage surgery prostate sufferer ejaculation . Moreover , carry short hospitalization ambulatory case particular States Unis . The aim study lead AP-HP thus test feasibility TUNA hospitalization less 24h . Objective one : To test feasibility procedure TUNA time hospitalization le 24h . Number patient : A sample N=70 patient make possible estimate frequency success precision ± 10 % frequency high 75 % . Analyse statistical : Principal analyze : Count hold aim study principal analyse descriptives . For variable qualitative semi-quantitative bilateral confidence frequency interval 95 % ( IC95 ) present . If condition use asymptotic estimator would fill , exact estimator use . For quantitative average IC95 % , median variable outdistances interquartile calculate . Together analysis present general population center . Secondary analyze : In case rate important failure , exploratory analysis end identification predictive factor failure make analysis multivariate logistic regression . Awaited result : The precise evaluation carry present study make possible evaluate benefit report/ratio risk short run procedure feasibility within framework hospitalization surgery ambulatory . The implication important . Indeed , technique do ambulatory high rate success , technique treatment could propose alternative medical treatment bad responder medical treatment .</detailed_description>
