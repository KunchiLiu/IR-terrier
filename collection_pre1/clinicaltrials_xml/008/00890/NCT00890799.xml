	<brief_title>Transcatheter Closure Versus Surgery Perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perimembranous Ventricular septal defect ( VSD ) common congenital cardiac malformation constitute 20 % congenital cardiac disease . Though conventional surgery VSD widely accept procedure minimal operative mortality , carry small definite risk morbidity mortality associate cardiopulmonary bypass surgical closure . The newly appear transcatheter device closure technique provide alternative surgical closure . However , mid-to-long term effect technique use occluders clear . The aim study evaluate safety effectiveness transcatheter closure perimembranous ventricular septal defect use septal occluders .</detailed_description>
