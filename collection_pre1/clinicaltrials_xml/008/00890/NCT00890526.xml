	<detailed_description>Hyperacusis intolerance sound level normally judge acceptably loud others . The presence hyperacusis ( diagnose undiagnosed ) important reason person reject amplify sound hearing aid . Tinnitus Retraining Therapy ( TRT ) , originally propose treatment person debilitate tinnitus , offer significant secondary benefit increase Loudness Discomfort Levels ( LDLs ) , along expansion dynamic range loudness . TRT use counsel sound therapy daily exposure soft sound bilateral noise generator device ( NGs ) promote intervention hyperacusis . The hypothesis investigational study counsel sound therapy principle use TRT apply successfully treat hearing-impaired hearing-aid candidate reduce sound tolerance otherwise benefit hearing aid . The current study implement randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial ass efficacy TRT-based intervention reduce sound tolerance hearing-aid eligible person hyperacusis and/or restrict dynamic range . The trial design allow evaluation efficacy partial treatment , include effect counsel separately effect sound therapy . Forty hearing-impaired subject ( without primary tinnitus ) assign randomly one four treatment group : 1 ) full treatment , counsel sound-therapy ( n=10 ) ; 2 ) counsel placebo sound therapy ( n=10 ) ; 3 ) sound therapy without counsel ( n=10 ) ; 4 ) placebo sound therapy without counsel ( n=10 ) . Subjects evaluate least monthly , typically five month , variety audiometric test , include LDLs , Contour Test Loudness tone speech , word recognition measure session 's comfortable loud level , electrophysiological measure .</detailed_description>

Each patient demonstrable hyperacusis , free tinnitus , must willing wear usc binaural intheear sound generator ( placebo generator ) chronically prescribe . Evidence conductive , mixed hearing loss , CNS disease . Abnormal tone and/or acoustic reflex decay also preclude subject participation potential patient adapt chronic sound therapy .</criteria>
