	<brief_summary>The integration magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) treatment plan process prostate cancer reduce uncertainty delineation prostate gland , enable delineation urethra , penile bulb , internal pudendal artery . The integration daily cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) markedly reduce set-up uncertainty , thereby reduce minimum planning target volume ( PTV ) margin . By combine MRI simulation daily CBCT , adapt radiation delivery accordingly , investigator reduce dose deliver rectum , bladder , urethra , erectile structure . In study , investigator seek determine whether dose reduction translates improve patient outcome . In prospective , 2-stage design , 190 patient enrol . In first stage , advance imaging integrate without alter dose plan technique . Stage 2 reduce dose deliver normal tissue , collect toxicity outcome measure . This clinical trial conduct 3 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced Imaging Radiotherapy Treatment Planning Guidance Low-Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer ( Margin )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances medical imaging , integration treatment plan daily guidance radiotherapy , stand improve therapeutic ratio . Improved imaging reduce uncertainty 1 ) improve accuracy reproducibility organ tumor delineation , 2 ) guide adapt delivery account organ motion . This paradigm widely accept radiotherapy community , much research address technical dosimetric aspect sound clinical implementation . However , direct evidence clinical translation improve patient outcomes limited . In study , hypothesize integration advance image treatment plan guidance safely enable reduction dose deliver normal tissue , improve toxicity quality life ( QOL ) outcomes patient receive external beam radiotherapy low intermediate risk prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
