	<brief_title>Effectiveness Supplementary Feeding During Infection Among Moderately Malnourished Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Under nutrition contribute factor least third child death . Whilst severe malnutrition high mortality risk , malnutrition-related death think related mild-moderate malnutrition.This moderate malnutrition common , directly increase risk death common infectious disease may progress severe malnutrition . Malnutrition may arise poverty , food insecurity inadequate nutrition offer , may begin early life . Malnutrition exacerbate multiple effect infectious disease gastroenteritis , pneumonia , malaria HIV . All common infection associated net protein loss diversion essential amino acid produce acute phase immune response protein . Fever associate increase rest energy expenditure 7 13 % per degree Centigrade . Activation inflammatory cascade also cause reduced appetite loss lean tissue fat . Acute infection therefore associated growth faltering , result vicious cycle . Acute infection therefore potential target intervention interrupt vicious cycle malnutrition infection child . This study aim evaluate strategy give short-term RUSF supplement usual diet home , without daily observe feeding , administer exist health service Kilifi District Hospital , Kenya . RUSF low moisture content essentially lipid-enveloped paste , microbiologically stable long shelf life tropical temperature preserve delicate micronutrient vitamin A .</detailed_description>
