	<brief_title>Methacholine Challenge : Comparison Doubling Quadrupling Methacholine Dose Regimes Using Tidal Volume Method</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study confirm tidal volume technique methacholine delivery may employ methacholine challenge use quadruple dose schedule instead standard double dose schedule similar diagnostic efficacy , increase patient adverse event , short investigational duration . This previously show true use dosimeter technique methacholine challenge .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>You must 18 year age ; You must diagnosis asthma ; Excluding asthma , aware lung condition disease . You know hypersensitivity ( i.e . overreaction immune system ) methacholine parasympathomimetic agent cholinesterase inhibitor ( i.e . agent act similar way via nervous system â€” discuss study personnel ) ; You nurse mother woman child bear potential , may , intend become pregnant testing effect methacholine inhalation situation know ; Your baseline lung function poor ( ie . FEV force expiratory volume one second , le 65 % predicted value ) . This perform explain study personnel prior commence methacholine inhalation test ; You respiratory infection last four week ; If allergy , expose agent trigger asthma within last four week ; If significant chronic medical condition .</criteria>
