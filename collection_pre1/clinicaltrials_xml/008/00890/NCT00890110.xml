	<brief_summary>While different line evidence support notion renal cell cancer amenable immunologic vaccination , clinical benefit associate vaccine limit . One reason probably whole immunological state patient RCC tumor release various substance promote tolerance immune system towards carcinoma . Recent data demonstrate sunitinib effect immune system might enhance effectivity anti tumor vaccine . Since kidney cancer quite common resect primary tumor metastasis metastatic tumor resect ( metastasis ) , investigator plan use tumor source grow autologous carcinoma cell line use method use world wide many year institution decade modify cell dinitro phenol use irradiate cell patient vaccination combination sunitinib treatment . The investigator monitor clinical immunological parameter patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Vaccination Stage 4 Renal Cell Carcinoma Combined With Sunitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) constitute around 3 % solid tumor cure metastatic sidease report less 5 % patient . Together melanoma consider immune responsive tumor , moreover common practice resect primary tumor large metastasis even metastatic setting . Antiangiogenesis treatment currently favor antitumor drug , however use rarely result complete response/ cure . Recently demonstrate drug elicit shift immune environment RCC patient ( improve T1 response reduce Treg response ) .Our department experience treatment 200 melanoma patient cellular vaccination preparation primary tumor cell line various tumor include RCC . Interestingly , immune modulators antiCTLA-4 Ab demonstrate impressive activity patient previously vaccinate cellular vaccination . Working hypothesis : Vaccination autologous cellular vaccine RCC patient induce clinical immunological response help formulation well combine vaccination strategy cancer . Our aim : 1 ) Growth characterization primary RCC cell lines,2 ) vaccination autologous cellular vaccine combination sunitinib . 3 ) Clinical immunologic characterization derivation prognostic predictive factor . Methods : primary metastatic tumor resect one several Israeli hospital use derive autologous cell line use vaccination follow DNP modification combination regular Sunitinib treatment . Immunological clinical followup patient perform primary cell line grow in-vitro test include possible future use allogeneic vaccine . Expected result Good safety profile combine significant clinical immunological response expect . Importance : This research might result clinical benefit treat patient important formulation effective immune strategy kidney cancer . Probable implication Medicine : RCC vaccine combination therapy potential lead longer survival even cure propose study help formulation vaccine .</detailed_description>
