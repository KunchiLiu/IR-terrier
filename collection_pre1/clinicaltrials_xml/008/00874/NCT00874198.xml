	<brief_title>European Study Prediction Outcome Patients With Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study background : The selection patient idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus ( INPH ) shunting remain difficult . The upcoming guideline diagnosis management INPH state accept standard clinical presentation , result image various test provide information CSF dynamics 1 . Hebb Cusiamo could find single test reliably predict outcome shunt systematic review INPH 2 . To properly evaluate predictive value diagnostic test outcome shunt patient receive shunt irrespective test result . Only study set examine diagnostic reliability test CSF dynamic fulfil condition . The common finding study predictive value positive test high negative predictive value disappointingly low . In Dutch Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Study , contain 101 patient , positive negative predictive value lumbar constant flow infusion 92 % 34 % Rout 18 mmHg/ml/min 100 % 27 % Rout 24 3 . External lumbar CSF drainage 4 day result positive negative predictive value 87 % 36 % 4 . The predictive value cerebrospinal fluid tap test report Wikkelso et al 1986 100 % positive 45 % negative test 5 Another parameter CSF dynamic elastance express pressure volume-index ( PVI ) . In group 30 patient NPH high elastance , i.e low PVI best predictor mark rapid reduction ventricular size shunt 6 . One major issue whether false negative test mostly occur population . In patient INPH might cause much CSF circulation disorder parenchymal disease . From clinical experience think different patient false negative test , frequently encounter case positive tap test negative infusion test reverse . This also show study Kahlon et al . perform infusion test tap test 68 patient suspected NPH . Both test agree 45 % negative 31 % patient 7 . An important drawback INPH study far rather limited number patient , `` mixing '' idiopathic NPH patient ( primary NPH ) know cause ( secondary NPH ) trauma , subarachnoid hemorrhage stroke.INPH consider multfactorial condition disturbance CSF circulation well parenchymal abnormality vulnerable population much comorbidity . Because many outcome variable study prediction outcome need large number INPH patient . With exception , previous study CSF dynamic INPH conduct single high quality institution . We also demonstrate even good result obtain international cooperation provide high patient number . Therefore intend conduct large European multicentre study INPH include least 200 patient . All patient receive shunt system followed-up standardize protocol use primary secondary NPH outcome measure . Because continue controversy respect appropriate shunt open pressure many problem over- underdrainage insertion shunt , choose Codman Hakim programmable valve 8 . STUDY AIMS To determine primarily sensitivity , specificity , positive- negative predictive value resistance outflow CSF ( Rout ) CSF-Tap-Test prediction effect shunt surgery patient idiopathic NPH ( INPH ) prospective `` blind '' confirmative study . Secondarily predictive value elastance CSF biochemical marker evaluate population . Further , predictive value test rCBF vascular reserve capacity ( PET SPECT ) , MR investigation ( i.e . fMRI , MRS and/or diffusion tensor image etc . ) , continuous CSF drainage , B-wave analyse investigation evaluate cooperation individual centre . General study design : A prospective `` blind '' confirmative study least 200 consecutively included patient INPH fulfil clinical radiological inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients include period 2 year 20 centre enrol least 5 patient per year . All patient study receive ventriculo-peritoneal shunt , use Codman Programmable valve . After inclusion prior surgery 4 obligatory test perform . We measure resistance outflow CSF ( Rout ) intracranial elastance , CSF-Tap-Test carry CSF biochemical marker determine . The caretaker blind result . Rout result tap test primary investigation . Optional test rCBF vascular reserve capacity ( PET SPECT ) , MR investigation ( i.e . fMRI , MRS and/or diffusion tensor image ) , continuous CSF drainage B-wave analysis also perform prior surgery . The number patient include study optional test least 30 order qualify record data database . The patient evaluate battery consist handicap scale ( modified Rankin scale ) 7 test measure gait , cognition bladder function , 3 12 month surgery establishment work shunt . The patient also check one month surgery secure shunt efficacy . The change clinical sign disability surgery correlate result obligatory optional test . The primary outcome measure differences pre-operative 12 month score Rankin Scale composite NPH scale . These correlate result two primary investigation , resistance CSF outflow ( mmHg/ml/min ) CSF Tap Test ( % change ) . Patients data store electronically web-based central data base use special data security system data transfer . Access database provide official homepage protect certify username/password base authenticity mechanism .</detailed_description>
