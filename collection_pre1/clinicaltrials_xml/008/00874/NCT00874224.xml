	<brief_title>Surgical Recovery After Left Lateral Hepatic Sectionectomy : Laparoscopic Versus Open Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent development liver surgery include introduction laparoscopic surgery enhance recovery programme . Laparoscopic surgery enhance recovery programme focus fast recovery consequently short hospital length stay . The ORANGE-II trial prospective randomise controlled parallel group superiority trial double-blinded experimental prospective registry design determine whether laparoscopic surgery prefer open surgery patient undergo left lateral hepatic sectionectomy within enhanced recovery programme . The experimental design produce two randomised arm ; ( ) open LLS ( b ) laparoscopic LLS . An additional registry arm base surgeons/patients want randomise explicit preference either laparoscopic LLS open LLS ( c ) . The primary endpoint ORANGE II trial time functional recovery . The functional recovery criterion consist adequate pain control oral analgetics , mobility restore independent level , absence intravenous fluid administration , ability eat solid food finally normal decrease serum bilirubin level . A patient fully functionally recover five criterion satisfy . Secondary endpoint trial postoperative length hospital stay , readmission percentage , ( liver specific ) morbidity , quality life , body image cosmetic result , hospital societal cost one year long-term incidence incisional hernia . The ORANGE-II trial randomise control multicentre trial provide evidence merit laparoscopic surgery patient undergo left lateral hepatic sectionectomy participate enhanced recovery programme .</detailed_description>
