	<brief_summary>Acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) lead cause admission hospital US , associate high mortality , morbidity , major cost health care system . Much cost relates prolong hospitalization acute deterioration kidney function ( AKI ) , turn associate cardiovascular event recurrent ADHF . Strategies early detection minimization prevention AKI would therefore tremendous benefit patient health care system . A common reason hospitalization ADHF alter volume status renal impairment . Also , many patient ADHF underlying hypertension and/or recent acute coronary syndrome . Hypertension , diabetes chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) independent risk factor cardiovascular disease , diabetes lead cause CKD . Therefore , patient present ADHF high risk CV event , develop AKI . Therefore , strategies detect change renal status early may allow rapid intervention appropriate drug therapy attenuate AKI subsequent complication , may turn result prevention early readmission HF . Most ADHF patient underlie chronic heart failure ( CHF ) . CHF major cost health care system . About two third cost relate hospitalization acute deterioration heart failure ( HF ) . Strategies minimize prevent HF hospitalization therefore tremendous benefit patient health care system . The frequent reason hospitalization CHF patient alter volume status renal impairment . Therefore , ADHF , strategies early detection change renal status may allow intervention appropriate drug therapy attenuate , even prevent , need patient return hospital . Many approach study relation concept . Deterioration renal function harbinger need hospitalization , indeed predictor medium term mortality . However , current measure renal function relatively crude considerable lag insult kidney translation measurable deterioration renal function reflect worsen serum creatinine . Thus , diagnostic test evaluate renal injury modulate early time course process may considerable utility ADHF setting also predict decompensation CHF setting .</brief_summary>
