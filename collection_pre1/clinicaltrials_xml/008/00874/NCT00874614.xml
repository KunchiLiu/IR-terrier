	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Ultratrace Iobenguane I131 Patients With Malignant Relapsed/Refractory Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Azedra™ Ultratrace® ( Iobenguane I 131 ) , commonly refer Ultratrace Iobenguane I 131 , high specific activity form iobenguane I 131 , produce use Molecular Insight 's proprietary Ultratrace® platform . Based well characterized cellular active transport mechanism , high specific activity iobenguane I 131 , great cellular uptake radioactivity hence great tumor uptake . During study subject receive two ( 2 ) Therapy Doses give three ( 3 ) month apart . Prior administration first Therapy Dose , subject give Imaging Dose Ultratrace Iobenguane I 131 undergo iobenguane I 131 scan evaluate tumor uptake measure normal organ distribution allow calculation radiation dose normal organ . Screening procedure eligibility need do image therapeutic dos Iobenguane I 131 administer . Hospitalization require approximately one ( 1 ) week two ( 2 ) Therapeutic Doses . Frequent follow necessary first year follow visit may do visit health care professional subject ' home . Subjects follow treatment study one ( 1 ) year additional four ( 4 ) year long-term follow .</detailed_description>
