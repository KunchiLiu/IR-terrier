	<brief_title>Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Basal Insulin Dosing Requirements Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects teach CHO counting introduce insulin pump . They wear insulin pump three week adjust pump function . Then subject wear Continuous Glucose Monitoring System determine rate change need achieve short-term near normal glucose control . The primary endpoint mean number change basal infusion rate mean difference mean duration change . The secondary endpoint mathematical formula describe relationship dose factor significantly differ previously establish King Armstrong .</detailed_description>
