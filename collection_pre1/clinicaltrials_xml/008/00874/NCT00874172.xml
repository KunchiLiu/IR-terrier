	<brief_summary>Quality life adult patient sickle cell disease deeply impair severe adverse medical event inadvertently occur throughout time life . Indeed , patient present life threaten condition often present emergency department sickle cell disease crisis relate pain . Currently , effectiveness specific analgesic strategy treat sickle cell disease crisis relate pain mostly base acetaminophen opioid derivates combination along oxygen delivery . Those strategy effective may last half hour obtain pain relief . This delay mostly depend availability venous access individual patient response treatment . Nitrous oxide volatile efficient analgesic therapy repeatedly show allow rapid analgesia emergency department set . The investigator hypothesise new analgesic strategy ( rapid optimize analgesic strategy ) include nitrous oxide nefopam would safe rapidly effective current analgesic strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose study : The main objective evaluate effectiveness optimize combination analgesic therapy treat uncomplicated sickle cell disease crisis initial visit emergency room Henri Mondor hospital . Secondary objective : - Total amount morphine require first 4 hour hospital emergency . - Overall amount morphine administer duration patient stay hospital Henri Mondor . - Side effect analgesic strategy - Adverse medical event - Length hospital stay . - 7-day 1-month follow-up collection follow data : 1 . Total number sickle cell disease crises 2 . Number subsequent readmission and/or visit ED 3 . Quality life ( EuroQol EQ-5D , SF-36 ) 4 . Patient satisfaction : pain treatment satisfaction scale . Study design : prospective monocentric open-label randomize control trial Number patient : 200 Follow per patient : 1 month , Study enrolment period : 25 month . Contraindications nefopam administration : hypersensitivity nefopam , benign prostatic hypertrophy glaucoma , history seizure . - contraindication morphine administration hypersensitivity morphine , decompensate respiratory failure , acute head trauma , uncontrolled epilepsy , severe hepatocellular failure , intracranial hypertension , use buprenorphine nalbuphine Contraindications MEOPA administration , intra-cranial hypertension , non cooperative patient ( sleepiness ; encephalopathy , refusal participate ) , pneumothorax , emphysema , pneumoperitoneum , digestive occlusion , pneumomediastinum , air embolism , dive accident , facial trauma , patient recent administration ophthalmic gas ( SF6 , C3F8 , C2F6 ) &lt; 3 month ) . - contraindication use oxygen : no-absolute contraindication health insurance , adult tutelage Main criterion : Proportion patient relieve ( pain intensity simple numerical scale &lt; 4 ) 30 minute arrival emergency department . Secondary criterion : - amount morphine administrate within first 4 hour presentation emergency department - overall amount morphine administrate hospital stay - adverse event relate study treatment - adverse medical event hospitalization - length stay . - 7-day 1-month follow-up collect follow data : 1 . Total number sickle cell disease crises 2 . Number subsequent readmission and/or visit ED 3 . Quality life ( EuroQol EQ-5D , SF-36 ) 4 . Patient satisfaction : pain treatment satisfaction scale .</detailed_description>
