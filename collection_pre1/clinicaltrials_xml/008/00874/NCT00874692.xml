While reduce temperature domestic hot water tank recommend injury prevention strategy , UK slow adopt 'passive ' safety measure . However , Camden Council employ Boiler Management System ( BMS ) boiler house centrally set hot water temperature part social housing stock , provide opportunity evaluate various impact 'passive ' safety measure , include quantify effect BMS average hot water temperature delivery , annual energy cost , annual greenhouse gas emission ; model reduction scald injury ; identify cost-effectiveness system public health intervention ; well describe experiences/ perception risk scald identify health social benefit BMS . Boiler house BMS randomise remain constant set temperature BMS reduce temperature sterilisation programme . A process evaluation also undertaken assess acceptability water temperatures tenant .</detailed_description>
