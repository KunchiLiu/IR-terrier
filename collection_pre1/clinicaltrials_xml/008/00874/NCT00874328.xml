	<brief_summary>The irinotecan cisplatin combination show significant anti-tumor activity . In first-line setting , investigator show regimen significant anti-tumor activity 47 % chemo-na√Øve NSCLC patient 1-year survival rate 64.2 % . Again , investigator show second-line Irinotecan cisplatin active well-tolerated regimen patient advance NSCLC pretreated non-platinum base chemotherapy . TS-1 ( Jeil Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd , Seoul , Korea ) oral anticancer drug comprise tegafur , 5-chloro-2 , 4-dihydroxypyridine potassium oxonate , molar ratio 1:0.4:1 . Tegafur prodrug generates 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) blood via metabolism liver enzyme , 5-chloro-2 , 4-dihydroxypyridine enhance serum concentration 5-FU competitive inhibition dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase , enzyme responsible 5-FU catabolism . Potassium oxonate also reversible competitive inhibitor orotate phosphoribosyl transferase , phosphoenzyme 5-FU . Diarrhea induce 5-FU administration though attributable phosphorylation 5-FU enzyme gastrointestinal tissue . After oral administration potassium oxonate , concentration potassium gastrointestinal tissue high enough inhibit enzyme concentration blood tumor report either slight nil . Because mechanism , oral TS-1 administration generate high concentration 5-FU protract intravenous infusion 5-FU give dose equimolar tegafur S-1 , whereas incidence adverse event concern GI tract increase . In phase II trial TS-1 first-line set NSCLC , response rate 22 % median survival time 10.2 month . As expect , incidence severe gastrointestinal adverse event low , severe hematologic toxicity . Recently 3-weekly TS-1 plus cisplatin show activity NSCLC response rate 32.7 % safety acceptable .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic cytologic diagnosis NSCLC , Stage IV select stage IIIB ( malignant pleural pericardial effusion ) accord American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) . 2 . In phase I , previous chemotherapy include cytotoxic chemotherapy except irinotecan cisplatin therapy , target therapy and/or radiotherapy allow ; patient require discontinued previous antitumor treatment least 4 week . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy allow regarded onetime systemic chemotherapy . 3 . In phase II , prior chemotherapy , radiotherapy target therapy allow . ( Prior radiation therapy allow long irradiated area source measurable disease . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy allow . ) 4 . Performance status 0 , 1 , 2 ECOG criterion . 5 . At least one unidimensionally measurable lesion meeting Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 2000 ) . 6 . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . 7 . Patient compliance allow adequate followup . 8 . Adequate organ function . 9 . Metastasis CNS regard exclusion symptom control properly supportive care include corticosteroid . 10 . Informed consent patient 11 . If female : childbearing potential either terminate surgery , radiation , menopause , attenuate use approve contraceptive method ( intrauterine device [ IUD ] , birth control pill , barrier device ) 3 month trial . If male , use approve contraceptive method study 3 month afterwards . Females childbearing potential must urine negative hCG test within 7 day prior study treatment . 1 . MI within precede 6 month symptomatic heart disease , include unstable angina , congestive heart failure uncontrolled arrhythmia 2 . Serious concomitant infection include postobstructive pneumonia 3 . Second primary malignancy ( except situ carcinoma cervix adequately treat basal cell carcinoma skin prior malignancy treat 5 year diagnosis without recurrence ) 4 . Pregnant nursing woman 5 . Psychiatric disorder would preclude compliance . 6 . Major surgery biopsy within past two week . 7 . Patients receive concomitant treatment drug interact S1 flucytosine , phenytoin , warfarin et al .</criteria>
