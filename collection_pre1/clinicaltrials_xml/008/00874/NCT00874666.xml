	<brief_title>Allicin Bioavailability From Garlic Supplements Garlic Foods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The bioavailability allicin , main active compound garlic , garlic supplement garlic food highly questionable unpredictable vitro test , due dependence upon alliinase activity condition challenge alliinase activity ( heat , gastric acid , intestinal protease ) . It likely garlic supplement manufacturing procedure coating , meal condition supplement consume ( high low protein ) , garlic food preparation condition ( temperature , surface area ) greatly affect allicin bioavailability . Such variability may account many conflict see clinical trial cardiovascular disease risk factor . To resolve issue , study determine actual bioavailability allicin several type garlic supplement garlic food various condition . Bioavailability determine measure area 32-hour curve breath concentration allyl methyl sulfide , main metabolite allicin .</detailed_description>
