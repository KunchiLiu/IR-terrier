	<brief_summary>Current evidence indicate fruit vegetable intake dietary pattern rich fruit vegetable may associate reduced insulin resistance may reduce risk metabolic syndrome . If prove , relationship may partly explain inverse association fruit vegetable intake cardiovascular disease risk . There currently publish dietary intervention examine detail relationship fruit vegetable intake insulin resistance . There , however , preliminary evidence whole diet intervention diet rich fruit vegetable may beneficial effect insulin resistance . Evidence date indicate investigation direct association fruit vegetable intake insulin resistance carefully control intervention study warrant . This study investigate dose−response effect fruit vegetable intake insulin resistance people overweight high−risk CVD use state−of−the−art technique .</brief_summary>
