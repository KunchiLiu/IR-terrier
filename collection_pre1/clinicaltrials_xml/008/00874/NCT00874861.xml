	<brief_summary>This pilot vaccine study adult recurrent WHO Grade II glioma . The purpose study test safety efficacy experimental tumor vaccine make peptide combination study drug Poly-ICLC . Poly-ICLC , manufacture Oncovir , Inc. , already receive generally well tolerated subject earlier study show decrease size brain tumor case . The immunological safety data use decide whether large study clinical efficacy warrant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HLA-A2-Restricted Glioma Antigen-Peptides Vaccinations With Poly-ICLC Recurrent WHO Grade II Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study vaccination regime design efficiently induce anti-tumor T-cell response patient recurrent WHO grade II glioma . The propose regime combine subcutaneous injection glioma-associated antigen ( GAA ) -derived cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) epitope-peptides simultaneous intramuscular ( i.m . ) administration poly-ICLC . The overall objective pilot study collect immunological safety data use decide whether large study clinical efficacy warrant patient . All patient study follow minimum 2 year , actual 2-year overall survival ( OS ) , 6-month 2-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate determine exploratory manner .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Participants must recurrent supratentorial WHO grade II astrocytoma , oligoastrocytoma oligodendroglioma histologically confirm either previous biopsy resection , time reoperation ( reoperation entry current study allow ; however postsurgery Decadron must least 4 week administration first vaccine ) . Patients may receive prior external beam radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy . With regard prior therapy , patient may treatment 2 prior relapse . Relapse define progression follow initial therapy ( i.e . radiation +/ chemo use initial therapy ) . The intent therefore patient may 3 prior therapy ( initial therapy treatment 2 relapse ) . If patient surgical resection relapse disease , anticancer therapy institute 12 week , patient undergoes another surgical resection , consider 1 relapse . 2 . HLAA2 positive base flow cytometry . 3 . Tumor recurrence define increase maximum tumor diameter , base axial and/or coronal T2 FLAIR MR image . Increase tumor size base comparison previous scan perform prior 3 year allow assessment slowgrowth tumor . 4 . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy : 4 week investigational agent , 4 week prior cytotoxic therapy and/or least two week vincristine , 4 week nitrosoureas , 3 week procarbazine administration , 1 week noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . ( radiosensitizer count ) . Any question relate definition noncytotoxic agent direct Principal Investigator . With regard previous RT , must least 6 month completion RT ( radiosurgery ) . 5 . Participants must least 18 year old . For patient 18 year old , separate , similar vaccine study Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh . 6 . All participant must sign informed consent document . 7 . Participants must Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 ( Appendix I ) . 8 . Documented negative serum HCG female participant childbearing age . Males female must agree , consent form , use effective birth control method course vaccination . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother peptidebased vaccine polyICLC , breastfeed discontinue mother treat study . 9 . Participants must free systemic infection . 10 . Participants adequate organ function measure white blood count ≥ 2500/mm3 ; lymphocyte ≥ 800/mm3 ; platelet ≥ 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL , AST , ALT , GGT , LDH , alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit , total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL , serum creatinine within 1.5 X upper limit normal limit . Coagulation test PT PTT within normal limit . 1 . Presence gliomatosis cerebri , cranial spinal leptomeningeal metastatic disease . 2 . Even initial diagnosis WHO grade II glioma , pathological diagnosis recurrent disease demonstrate transformation high grade ( i.e . WHO grade III IV ) glioma , patient exclude eligibility . 3 . Concurrent treatment medication include : Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Interferon Allergy desensitization injection Growth factor Interleukins Any investigational therapeutic medication 4 . Participants must prior autoimmune disorder require cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy , autoimmune disorder visceral involvement . Participants active autoimmune disorder require therapy also exclude . Mild arthritis require NSAID medication exclusionary . 5 . Use immunosuppressive within 4 week prior study entry anticipate use immunosuppressive agent . Dexamethasone , corticosteroid medication , use perioperative period and/or radiotherapy , must taper discontinue least 4 week administration first vaccine . Topical corticosteroid Inhaled steroid acceptable . 6 . Participants another cancer diagnosis , except follow diagnosis allow : squamous cell cancer skin without know metastasis basal cell cancer skin without know metastasis carcinoma situ breast ( DCIS LCIS ) carcinoma situ cervix cancer without distant metastasis treat successfully , without evidence recurrence metastasis 5 year 7 . Participants know addiction alcohol illicit drug . 8 . Because patient immune deficiency expect respond therapy , HIVpositive patient exclude study . 9 . Patients previously participate UPCI 07057 exclude .</criteria>
