	<brief_title>Comparison 50 % Tilt Tuned Waveforms Single-Coil Active Can Configuration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There one prospective study find benefit use tune waveform 50/50 % tilt waveforms.11 Other study fail show much change defibrillation efficacy different duration biphasic waveform . A vast majority patient study test dual coil lead . Although dual coil lead low defibrillation threshold , know dual coil lead make lead extraction difficult , lead venous obstruction prone failure . Results recent study show single coil configuration adequate vast majority patient DFT test perform tuned waveform . This make use single-coil lead ICD/ CRT-D implant attractive option . Theoretical analysis show difference tune 50 % tilt waveform amplify high impedance level tune waveform superior ( unpublished ) . Accordingly , study design prospectively compare DFT estimate tune 50 % tilt waveform left-sided , active pectoral defibrillation lead system SVC coil turn OFF part shock circuit .</detailed_description>
