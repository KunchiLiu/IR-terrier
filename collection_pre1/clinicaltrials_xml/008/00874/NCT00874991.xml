	<brief_summary>The aim research apply cardiac tissue characterization order ass leave ventricular function cardiac surgical patient pre post cardiopulmonary bypass . The procedure use include retrospective review transesophageal image obtain conventional intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) cardiac surgery , well secondary analysis Tissue Doppler . The result compare hemodynamic data obtain pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients include study age 18 99 year age , present operating room cardiac surgery , receive pulmonary artery catheter routine intra-operative TEE . We look patient whose TEE image good quality . Subjects underwent cardiac surgery receive PAC routine TEE exam . We review data PAC , image conventional TEE exam , secondary analysis Tissue Doppler . A potential benefit society novel mean assess leave ventricular function . Our research benefit subject directly . There additional risk subject beyond insertion PAC TEE probe , routinely place patient under-going cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
