	<detailed_description>Background : Because little impact ventilatory requirement dyspnea , muscle electrostimulation appear promise alternative general physical reconditioning advance COPD feasibility confirm population . However , physiological mechanism underlie propose benefit electrostimulation training explore . Objective : To evaluate COPD patient physiological mechanism change exercise tolerance electrostimulation training . Method : We propose conduct control , randomize double blind clinical trial compare efficacy muscle electrostimulation train low limb sham train 24 patient COPD . Patients include either 6 week electrostimulation training ( active treatment group ) 6 week sham electrostimulation . Before training , patient perform endurance shuttle walk test , muscle function testing , muscle biopsy , blood sample health-related quality life questionnaire . Planning analysis : The main outcome change strength quadriceps 6-week electrostimulation program . The end-points mid-thigh calf muscle cross-sectional area , low limb muscle endurance , ventilation , dyspnea , leg fatigue , operational lung volume iso-time walking time endurance shuttle walk , muscle hypertrophying/atrophying pathway muscle aerobic capacity . For group , pre- post-training comparison make use repeated measure design . The magnitude pre- post-training change also compare group two-way ANOVA ( group , train effect ) repeat measure second factor ( train effect ) . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
