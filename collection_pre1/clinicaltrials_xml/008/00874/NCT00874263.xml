	<brief_summary>The recently develop endoscopic Confocal probe microscopy system allow image surface epithelium ongoing endoscopy ( upper low ) potential immediate diagnosis various GI pre-malignant malignant lesion . The purpose study determine use new Confocal probe system find pre-cancerous abnormality stomach colon . Hypothesis : The confocal endomicroscopy image colorectal lesion standard colonoscopy could help classification vivo colorectal neoplastic non-neoplastic lesion . This could direct endoscopic intervention target biopsy early colorectal cancer lesion endoscopic resection lesion screen colonoscopy . Primary Aim 1 . To determine key confocal image feature neoplastic pre-neoplastic colorectal lesion include flat raise adenomatous polyp , intraepithelial neoplasia cancer well benign lesion hyperplastic polyp normal colonic epithelium estimate morphologic feature best distinguish neoplastic non-neoplastic tissue . Secondary Aims : 2 . To determine initial sensitivity specificity confocal microendoscopy image classification adenomatous hyperplastic polyp colon . 3 . In exploratory phase study develop library confocal microendoscopic image characteristic GI pathology : 1 . Barrett 's esophagus comparison Barrett 's esophagus dysplasia , normal squamous esophagus . 2 . Other encounter inflammatory neoplastic condition within GI tract biopsy removal tissue would routinely indicate . The second phase study focus establish sensitivity , specificity , accuracy confocal image colorectal lesion GI pathology well inter-observer agreement learn curve interpretation confocal image .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer second common cause cancer-related death U.S . Although removal pre-malignant polyp show reduce risk colorectal cancer , 50 % remove colonic polyp hyperplastic malignant potential . Removal benign polyp expose patient polypectomy-related complication cost without benefit . Current standard endoscope use accessory confocal endomicroscopy probe allow routine confocal microscopy imaging . Colonoscopies upper endoscopy perform routine include conscious sedation . A special fiber scope , combine small amount dye call fluorescein give vein , use obtain microscopic view endoscopic procedure . If colorectal lesion GI lesion find would normally require biopsy , site biopsy evaluate confocal image Cellvizio-GI Fiberoptic probe prior biopsy removal suspicious tissue . Following image acquisition , lesion biopsied remove per standard clinical care . Standard endoscopic variable lesion record include : name record number , date , time , exact time fluorescein injection time image acquisition , lesion location , size , suspect finding ( inflammation , dysplasia , type polyp ) final histological diagnosis .</detailed_description>
