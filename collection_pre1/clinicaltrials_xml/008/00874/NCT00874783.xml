	<brief_summary>Human fibroblasts possibly human somatic cell may reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cell force expression transcription factor ( 1-5 ) . The iPS cell seem share many property human embryonic stem cell . Induced pluripotent stem cell potentially may useful future unlimited source cell transplantation . The major goal project develop human iPS cell cell culture skin biopsy patient 's hair . The iPS cell develop primarily model disease drug discovery well basic research , develop technology may eventually allow use iPS cell future transplantation therapy . The iPS cell develop course application intend use transplantation therapy . Future development iPS cell clinical transplantation therapy subject appropriate authorization ethical regulatory committee .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The derivation human iPS cell ( 1-5 ) open new avenue model human disease since may possible develop iPS cell fibroblasts somatic cell patient various condition . These iPS cell may direct differentiate cell affect specific condition . Abnormalities development affect cell well alter survival function cell may study . Thus iPS cell may serve invaluable model study pathogenesis human disease may also serve development new drug , high throughput screen molecule toxic therapeutic effect . In addition great potential iPS cell disease model transplantation therapy , cell may broad application basic research various area reprogramming , basic development others . At present , still unclear whether property iPS cell identical hESCs . Initial data suggest human iPS cell indeed similar hESCs phenotype , epigenetic status pluripotent self-specific gene , telomerase activity , gene expression profile capability differentiate progeny three germ layer vitro vivo teratoma ( 2 , 3 , 5 ) . In mouse system , direct differentiation iPS cell bone marrow repopulating hematopoietic stem cell functional dopaminergic neuron demonstrate ( 6 , 7 ) . However , incomplete silence constitutive expression transcription factor use induce reprogramming probably interfere differentiation ( 1 ) . Further study require confirm developmental potential biological property iPS cell identical hESC . Currently , retroviral vector commonly use introduce express transgene reprogram somatic nucleus ( 1-5 ) . The use retroviral vector , integrate host cell genome , may cause hazardous insertion mutagenesis . Moreover , use potentially oncogenic transcription factor , c-Myc , significantly limit clinical use human iPS cell future cell therapy . However , successful derivation iPS cell demonstrate without forced expression c-Myc . The decreased efficiency reprogramming , absence overexpressed c-Myc , may improve molecule act via epigenetic mechanism . Moreover , successful derivation iPS cell recently report use non-integrating adeno viral vector repeat transfections . Thus appear development , may possible future safely induce pluripotent cell somatic cell therapeutic application .</detailed_description>
