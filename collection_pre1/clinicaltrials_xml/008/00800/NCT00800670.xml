	<brief_title>Study Safety Immunogenicity Adenovirus-based Tuberculosis Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As global tuberculosis ( TB ) epidemic continue , incidence latent active TB expect rise . HIV-infected person especially susceptible TB . An improved TB vaccine present BCG vaccine need . The general objective TB vaccine research program develop safe effective vaccine person increase risk contract TB reactivate latent tuberculosis develop safe booster vaccine person previously vaccinate BCG . This open-labeled phase 1 single institution trial investigate recombinant genetic TB vaccine AdAg85A give intramuscular injection healthy subject without history BCG vaccination . Ad5Ag85A recombinant replication-deficient adenoviral vector express M. tuberculosis immunogenic antigen Ag85A . We show safe , immunogenic associate enhanced protection challenge virulent M Tb murine , bovine guinea pig model . Clinical grade AdAg85A manufacture Robert E Fitzhenry Vector Laboratory , Centre Gene Therapeutics , McMaster University , Hamilton , Ontario , Canada . The effect pre-existing adenovirus antibody safety immunogenicity recombinant AdTB vaccine evaluate result PPD skin test follow vaccination evaluate subset subject history negative PPD skin test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy human subject 18 55 year age without history BCG vaccination . HIV antibody negative For woman , negative pregnancy test practise two acceptable form contraception duration study ( barrier contraceptive , birth control pill , surgically sterile , postmenopausal 2yrs , abstinence ) For men , use barrier contraception duration study Pregnant lactate woman Subjects acute chronic illness include active tuberculosis receive drug treatment opinion investigator likely affect immune system . Subjects symptoms suggestive upper respiratory tract infection ( include cough , runny nose , sore throat ) Subjects history active latent TB infection whose PBMCs strongly responsive ESAT6/CFP10 stimulation use commercial interferon gamma release assay TB [ consistent latent TB infection ] . Subjects laboratory value outside normal range . Not available schedule followup visit . Subjects enrol trial must follow 7 day , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 24 week postvaccination . Failure provide write consent . Known allergy vaccine component Known exposure active TB within past 6 month subject whose occupation put increase risk TB exposure ( base Hamilton Health Science/St Joseph Healthcare list high risk personnel ) Any abnormality chest xray suggestive active remote tuberculosis infection . PPD skin test within last 12 month BCG status unknown</criteria>
