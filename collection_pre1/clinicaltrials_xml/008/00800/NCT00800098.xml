	<detailed_description>General Procedure : Subjects screen : history knee pain surgery questionnaire ; kidney disease determine blood creatinine level ; knee diameter le 17cm body diameter le 60 cm due physical constraint MRI . Prior X-rays MRIs examine evaluate subject 's level OA . X-rays MRIs old 2 year , use potential subject receive one set 2 knee x-rays prior enrollment . If qualify wish enroll , match age , sex degree OA assign 3rd party investigator either placebo group active treatment group . Subjects ask complete baseline questionnaire , functional test , blood draw MRI screening start treatment . Enrolled subject apply 2.5 gram active placebo cream 3 time per day skin affect knee 12 week . Further measurement take periodically throughout course study , detail . MRI : Subjects receive MRI scan affect knee 3 time : enrollment , 12 week , 15 month . The MRI scan session take place Lucas Center MRI Stanford University . In preparation MRI scan , subject require fill standard MRI screen form ensure condition could interfere MRI imaging could make scan way hazardous . During session , subject lie scanner table back legs straight . We scan one knee . The time scan approximately 1 hour . This entire session take approximately 1 1/2 hour , include setup time . Subjects may ask receive small dose intravenous gadolinium contrast agent , administer Dr. Gold . This improve evaluation articular cartilage . Questionnaires : Subjects receive physical activity , pain function questionnaires enrollment , 4 week , 8 week , 12 week , 14 week , 16 week , 20 week , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month , 15 month . They also keep log use pain medicine , aspirin . Blood/Urine Samples : A small amount blood ( 2 tablespoon 30 ml ) drawn urine collect 11 time throughout investigation study blood marker cartilage breakdown ( COMP , CTX2 , Glc-Gal-PYD ) synthesis ( PIIANP ) well inflammation ( HA , CRP ) joint vascularity ( TNF-alpha , IL-6 , osteocalcin ) . Blood creatinine level test baseline . Functional Testing : Subjects also participate functional test include walk test , rise chair , climb stair 11 time throughout 15-month study . The `` 6-minute Walk '' test good indicator cardiovascular capacity . We ask subject cover much ground possible 6 minute maintainable pace , record distance travel .
