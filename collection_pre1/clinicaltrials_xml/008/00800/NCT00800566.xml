	<brief_title>Oral Clofarabine Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Clofarabine design interfere growth development cancer cell . Screening Tests : Before begin take study drug , `` screening test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test procedure perform : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - You also ask drug currently take . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You also bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . - Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . The blood would draw part routine sample describe . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level clofarabine base join study . Up 7 dose level clofarabine test . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose clofarabine find . The dose clofarabine may lower delay help reduce side effect . Study Drug Administration : On Days 1-21 28-day study `` cycle '' , take clofarabine mouth day ( morning ) time everyday . - You take clofarabine empty stomach . - You try fast ( eat anything drink anything water ) midnight night dose 1 hour take clofarabine . - Clofarabine take 4 ounce ( 1/2 cup ) water . - You drink coffee caffeinated liquid 1 hour take study drug . - If vomit 15 minute take drug , replace make drug . If vomit le 15 minute take drug , retake dose . If vomit within 15 minute retake dose , take drug day make note diary . Study Visits : - On Day 1 every cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - You ask experienced intolerable side effect feel . Once week Cycle 1 , physical exam . Once week every cycle , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test ( blood count platelet ) . Your blood drawn often doctor feel necessary . After Cycles 3 6 , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease . If go study Cycle 3 doctor think necessary , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy may take go study . If complete 6 cycle study drug , every 6 month ( +/- 2 month ) , physical exam blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw check status disease overall health . The study doctor tell test may need . Length Study You study drug 6 cycle ( 6 month ) . You take study early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . Additional Information : You need stay Houston Cycle 1 ( 28 day ) . After , may return home still return Houston cycle unless choose check-up visit blood test local doctor . This investigational study . Clofarabine FDA approve commercially available give vein pediatric patient treatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) come back responded treatment . The use clofarabine mouth FDA approve . At time , oral clofarabine use research . Up 36 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
