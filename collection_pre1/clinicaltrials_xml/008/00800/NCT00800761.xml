	<brief_summary>Myocardial iron overload lead cause death patient beta-thalassemia major ( TM ) . Therapy deferoxamine ( DFO ) combine deferiprone ( DFP ) reduce myocardial iron improve cardiac function . However , prognosis TM patient establish cardiac disease switch DFO monotherapy combine DFP/DFO chelation unknown . Twenty-eight TM patient cardiac disease enrol prospective study last 42Â±6 month . Fifteen ( 9 high-ferritin 6 low-ferritin ) place DFP/DFO ( DFP , 75 mg/kg t.i.d . ; DFO , 40-50 mg/kg 8-12 h night 5-7 d/wk ) , 13 ( 5 high- 8 low-ferritin ) receive DFO alone . No cardiac event observe among high-ferritin patient combination therapy , whereas 4 cardiac event ( p=0.0049 ) , include three death , occur high-ferritin patient DFO monotherapy . These finding demonstrate TM patient well-established cardiac disease combine iron-chelation therapy DFP/DFO superior DFO monotherapy .</brief_summary>
