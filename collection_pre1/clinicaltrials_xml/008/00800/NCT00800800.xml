	<criteria>Mild moderate AS define peak Doppler aortic valve velocity 2.5 4 m/sec Baseline LDLC value must within target level risk category accord Canadian Guidelines Baseline triglyceride level must within target level risk category Very mild AS define peak Doppler AS velocity &lt; 2.5m/sec , rate progression well define ; Females child bear potential practice adequate contraception . Severe AS define peak Doppler AS velocity &gt; 4m/sec . These patient exclude high probability aortic valve replacement even without AS progression . Greater moderate aortic regurgitation , define aortic jet width aortic outflow tract ratio &gt; 0.45 ; Patients diabetes fast blood sugar level &gt; 7.0 mmol/L ( must confirm one repeat assay within 14 day ) . Significant concomitant mitral valve disease , define &gt; moderate mitral regurgitation ( MR ) mitral valve area ( MVA ) &lt; 1.5 cm2 ; A high risk CAD ( 10 year risk &gt; 30 % ) , accord Canadian Guidelines .</criteria>
