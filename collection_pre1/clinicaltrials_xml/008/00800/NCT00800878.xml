	<brief_summary>The Indo-Asian developing country face epidemic chronic disease include hypertension , diabetes chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Diagnosis early CKD essential institution effective timely prevention complication ; costly late stage treatment end stage renal disease currently unfeasible option population . GFR estimate kidney function provide common reference standard people therefore readily applicable physician understood patient . However , exist GFR equation yield widely discrepant result Indo Asian population , none currently available estimate equation validate population . The main objective develop tool use screen subject high risk develop CKD ( hypertension diabetes ) well general population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study conduct Aga Khan University collaboration Tufts-New England Medical Center Imperial College , UK . It population base cross-sectional study use 2-stage cluster design . The study would perform 650 adult subject general population Karachi . A new GFR equation specific Pakistani population would develop validated use gold standard measure Insulin GFR . The performance new equation compare exist one develop population respect bias , precision , accuracy . The project likely contribute significantly move field kidney disease forward , result likely far reach implication understand CKD , ultimately , prevention Indo-Pakistani population worldwide .</detailed_description>
