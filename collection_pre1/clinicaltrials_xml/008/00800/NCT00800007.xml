	<brief_title>Study Safety Tolerability Multiple Intravenous Doses ANZ-521 Adults With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/2 Randomized , Placebo Controlled , Double-Blind clinical trial evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacodynamics ANZ-521 , investigational product weaken form ( attenuate ) Listeria monocytogenes , type bacteria commonly find environment . ANZ-521 alter lab reduce ability cause disease , maintain stimulation immune system . ANZ-521 also genetically modify recombinant DNA encode consensus sequence antigen call NS5B polymerase NS3 proteinase correspond viral protein find virus cause Hepatitis C. It hop ANZ-521 stimulate immune response Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) liver , thereby demonstrate effective therapy individual chronic HCV infection . The purpose first clinical trial ANZ-521 identify appropriate dose investigational agent later clinical study explore safety give consent adult HCV . Immunological response ANZ-521 study participant also measure . Patients choose enter study must meet study entry criterion . The first part study ( Part A ) enroll subject receive prior treatment standard care therapy HCV . The second part study ( Part B ) enroll subject previously receive standard care therapy HCV intolerant standard care . Qualifying study patient assign receive one least 2 dose level ANZ-521 placebo . Each patient may receive 3 intravenous administration ( 28 day apart ) ANZ-521 placebo assign dose level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Chronic liver disease consistent chronic hepatitis C infection , genotype 1 , least 6 month For Part A : patient full course interferon ribavirin define NIH Consensus Statement Management Hepatitis C : 2002 ( Management hepatitis C : 2002 , 2002 ) detectable viral titer Screening . For Part B : patient HCV treatmentnaïve know contraindication ( i.e. , history depression ) interferon ribavirin combination therapy ; patient start interferon ribavirin stop therapy early due intolerance ; patient receive interferon ribavirin refuse therapy Plasma HCV RNA viral titer ≥ 2 log assay cutoff measure Screening . Females must nonchild bear potential [ i.e. , 1 year post menopausal document surgically sterile ] . Men must agree use acceptable form birth control study 28 day final dose ANZ521 . Liver biopsy within last 3 year Ishak Score &lt; 3 FibroSURE test score &lt; 0.59 . Compensated liver disease ( ChildPugh class A ) adequate organ function define studyspecific laboratory test . Signed Informed Consent willing able comply study procedure . Patients null responder interferonbased therapy define less 1log decrease viral titer baseline treatment . Treatment antiHCV therapy within one month prior study . History infection Listeria . History receive experimental HCV vaccine ( therapeutic preventive ) . Known allergy penicillin sulfa drug , component study drug product ( e.g. , glycerol ) . Current prior history certain studyspecified heart , liver , kidney , lung , neurological , immune medical condition . Artificial ( prosthetic ) joint artificial implant device easily remove . History malignancy type , surgically excise nonmelanomatous skin cancer situ cervical cancer within 5 year . Taking certain medication 2 g acetaminophen per day , systemic antibiotic within 14 day study entry , another investigational product within 28 day study entry . Recent hospitalization plan surgery require general anesthesia sedation . Drug screen positive cocaine . Positive HIV Hepatitis B antibody . Blood donation 450 mL within 8 week study entry . Other condition might affect subject 's ability give inform consent comply study requirement .</criteria>
