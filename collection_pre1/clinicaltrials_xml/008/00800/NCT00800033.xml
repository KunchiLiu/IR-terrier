	<brief_summary>The investigator specific objective determine effectiveness pulse-based diet combine exercise training program reduce risk metabolic syndrome old adult . The metabolic syndrome cluster risk factor predispose one development diabetes cardiovascular disease . These risk factor include increased abdominal obesity , high blood triglyceride level , low blood high-density lipoprotein , high blood pressure , high blood glucose insulin level , increase inflammation . The investigator hypothesize pulse-based diet combine exercise training effective reduce risk metabolic syndrome intervention act different component metabolic syndrome . The design involve randomize single-blind cross-over pulse-based diet , single blind randomize parallel group assignment exercise-based intervention . 100 subject randomize receive pulse-based diet regular diet 2 month cross-over receive opposite diet 2 month , separate one-month `` wash '' . Subjects randomize exercise `` exercise placebo '' group duration trial ( i.e . 5 month ) . The exercise intervention involve aerobic training effective reduce metabolic syndrome risk . Dependent variable measure 4 time point : baseline , first 2-month diet , second 2-month diet ( i.e . washout ) end second 2-month diet . These variable include : Serum triglyceride , high density lipoprotein , C-reactive protein ( inflammatory marker ) , glucose , insulin , trunk body fat , blood pressure . A composite metabolic syndrome score determine convert variable Z-scores determine mean Z-scores . Secondary variable include serum lipid , include low density lipoproteins total cholesterol .</brief_summary>
