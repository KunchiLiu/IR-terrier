	<brief_title>Do Physiotherapy Techniques Improve Posture During Admission Chest Infection Adults With Cystic Fibrosis ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental design A prospective , single blind , randomise control trial . Methods 50 subject recruit admit physiotherapist inpatient ward Royal Brompton Hospital . Using stratified computer randomisation , subject allocate either control ( treatment group ) treatment group . The randomisation carry independent member Department Cystic Fibrosis outcome measure record observer blind randomisation . Method : - Two key investigator involve study perform treatment intervention outline paragraphs - The subject ' record review key investigator ensure meet inclusion criterion - Prospective subject give write verbal information project give 24 hour consider entry study - Subjects give write consent participate project . The top copy include patient 's medical record copy place patient 's study file - A letter write subject 's General Practitioner outline purpose study invite him/her make contact discus study detail query concern - The subject withdraw clinical deterioration negate inclusion criterion discharge home intravenous antibiotic treatment - Three independent observer ( senior &amp; junior physiotherapist usually work patient group ) train ensure good intra &amp; inter-relater reliability record measurement Intervention treatment group : The treatment group receive intervention top usual chest physiotherapy medical care . A treatment series gentle joint muscle movement ( musculoskeletal intervention ) undertake physiotherapist , alternate day duration admission . The physiotherapy musculoskeletal assessment intervention may last 45 minute alternate weekday may include one combination follow technique document population postural change , thoracic stiffness , discomfort and/or pain : - Specific , gentle oscillatory mobilisation rib cage thoracic spine subject improve joint alignment mobility , reduce pain . These technique optimise chest wall mechanic , improve length-tension relationship muscle normalise movement dysfunctional area ( Maitland , Banks et al . 2001 ; Mulligan 2005 ) - Treatment specific muscle dysfunction tight muscle group optimise muscle length biomechanical relationship area ( Massery 2005 ) , lead improved efficiency recruitment improve power output ( Travell &amp; Simons 1983 ) - Postural education awareness discussion improve subject 's joint alignment ability functional manner . A short programme reinforce progress treatment session consist three specific stretch strengthening exercise may give . Control Group : The control group receive usual medical physiotherapy management placebo intervention . Data Collection : The outcome measure undertaken one three independent observer pre-agreed protocol , first intervention session , intervention session day five , day ten day discharge . The questionnaire CF-38 Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale complete initiation completion study . Sample size calculation : The number patient need study base test posture musculoskeletal intervention outpatient adult cystic fibrosis randomise control trial ( `` Do physiotherapy musculoskeletal technique improve force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) adult cystic fibrosis ? `` ; Ethics reference number : 06/Q0404/81 ) . To test three point change thoracic index 5 % significance level , use square-root within-mean standard error three would require least 50 patient achieve 90 % power . Analysis Statistical advice give Mr Michael Roughton , Statistician , Royal Brompton Hospital Imperial College London . The data analyse use appropriate test e.g . t-tests Mann-Whitney test . The intra &amp; inter-rater reliability repeatability measurement , independent observer , determine use Bland Atman plot ensure lie within clinically acceptable limit agreement .</detailed_description>
