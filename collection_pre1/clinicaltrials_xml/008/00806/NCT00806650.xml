	<brief_summary>This research trial study development blood test detect anti-insulin-like growth factor II mRNA bind protein 3 ( anti-IMP3 ) antibody micro ribonucleic acid ( microRNA ) patient renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) spread part body ( metastatic ) limit tissue organ begin ( localize ) . Anti-IMP3 tumor marker detect many human cancer , include RCC likely present serum ( blood ) patient metastatic localized RCC . Alterations microRNA expression also show play critical role cancer progression may promise biomarker patient RCC . Developing blood test anti-IMP3 antibody microRNA serum tissue sample patient laboratory may help doctor find diagnose RCC earlier , find far disease spread , plan effective treatment RCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To develop blood test monitoring titer IMP3 autoantibody and/or microRNA ( miRNA ) /small non-coding RNA ( snRNA ) expression patient ' serum early detection RCC recurrence/metastasis . OUTLINE : Serum sample collect prior treatment analyze anti-IMP3 autoantibody titer via via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) total RNA via sequencing , microarray , and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( q-PCR ) . Previously collect tissue sample analyze IMP3 via immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) .</detailed_description>
