	<brief_summary>Randomized , double blind , multi-site , study healthy adult , compare safety immunogenicity two dosage level Norwalk VLP Vaccine adjuvant/excipients placebo control Primary Objective : - Safety determine occurrence local intranasal symptom symptom report self-administered memory aid 7 day vaccination hematology , blood chemistry physical examination perform clinical research staff - Subjects also monitor Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) , onset new medical condition 180 day follow last study vaccination ( Day 201 ) . Secondary Objectives Evaluations immunogenicity determine : - Geometric mean titer seroconversion rate serum anti- Norwalk VLP IgG IgA - Stimulation anti-Norwalk VLP IgA antibody secrete cell ( ASC ) - Presence antigen specific memory B-cell response Cells collect store possible future evaluation Norwalk VLP-specific cell-mediated immune ( CMI ) responses Study Hypothesis : The incidence adverse event intranasal Norwalk VLP Vaccine incidence adverse event intranasal adjuvant/excipients alone . Norwalk VLP Vaccine adjuvant/excipients high incidence mild moderate nasal adverse event compare placebo similar incidence adverse event . Two dose 100 µg Norwalk VLP Vaccine immunogenic two dos 50 µg Norwalk VLP Vaccine . The post-vaccination serum antibody response , number antibody secrete cell ( ASC ) IgG IgA memory B-cell response direct Norwalk Virus antigen increase Norwalk VLP Vaccine compare adjuvant/excipients placebo .</brief_summary>
