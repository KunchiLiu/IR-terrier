	<brief_summary>It always know cause PAH best treatment . The doctor study would like understand people develop PAH . They also would like learn treatment might help PAH people might respond good treatment . Doctors think test certain substance find blood cell might help answer question . These substance normally release body protect u infection tell difference normal foreign substance body . Finally , new test study small molecule call microRNA control gene express . This study do see blood sample test determine might develop PAH , well drug work treat PAH learn development PAH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>You ask donate blood right heart catheterization also 3-4 month follow-up visit . The amount blood collect heart catheterization 20cc ( 4 teaspoon ) . This blood discard part clinical catheterization procedure , ask use research study . Then , follow-up right heart catheterization , ask donate 20 cc ( 4 teaspoon ) blood . If second right heart require clinical purpose ask give blood sample 3-4 month follow clinic visit . If require additional right heart catheterization , within one year , ask donate additional sample subsequent RHC .
