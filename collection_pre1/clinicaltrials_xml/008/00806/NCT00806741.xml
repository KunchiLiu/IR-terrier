	<brief_summary>Autoregulation define ability vascular bed adapt vascular resistance change perfusion pressure . In eye , several study report retinal blood flow autoregulated wide range ocular perfusion pressure . The investigator recently show nitric oxide ( NO ) key metabolite regulation vascular tone eye play important role blood flow autoregulation choroidal circulation . However , data yet available optic nerve head . Thus , present study design test hypothesis NO play also role optic nerve head blood flow autoregulation . Therefore , subject perform squat increase systemic perfusion pressure administration either nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ( L-NMMA ) , Î±-receptor agonist ( phenylephrine ) placebo . Optic nerve head blood flow continuously measure procedure investigate optic nerve head autoregulation .</brief_summary>
