	<brief_summary>Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) procedure people coronary artery disease ( CAD ) may undergo increase blood flow heart . During CABG procedure , people leak one valves heart—the mitral valve—may time undergo procedure repair valve . This study evaluate whether people moderate mitral valve leakage would better undergo CABG plus mitral valve repair procedure undergo CABG alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Effectiveness Mitral Valve Repair Procedure Combination With Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ( CABG ) Versus CABG Alone People With Moderate Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CAD occur artery supply blood heart become block result plaque buildup . In severe case , CAD cause chest pain , shortness breath , heart attack . CABG one treatment option people CAD . During CABG procedure , healthy artery vein another part body connect blocked coronary artery . Blood flow rout around blockage heart . After heart attack , people may leak mitral valve heart . This condition know ischemic mitral regurgitation ( IMR ) associate poor health outcome , include worsen heart failure . In people severe mitral valve leakage , CABG procedure mitral valve repair procedure routinely perform together ; however , people moderate valve leakage , consensus medical community whether mitral valve repair procedure beneficial time CABG . The purpose study determine whether people moderate mitral valve regurgitation undergo mitral valve repair procedure addition CABG undergo CABG alone . This study enroll people CAD require CABG procedure moderate mitral regurgitation . At baseline study visit , participant undergo physical examination ; blood collection ; neurocognitive test ; questionnaire regard medical history , medication history , quality life . In operating room , participant randomly assign undergo either CABG surgery mitral valve repair procedure CABG surgery . Blood , urine , tissue sample may collect participant surgery ; optional do prior approval participant . All participant attend study visit Months 6 , 12 , 24 . At visit , participant take part medication history review , physical examination , echocardiogram , cardiopulmonary exercise test , neurocognitive test , quality life survey .</detailed_description>
