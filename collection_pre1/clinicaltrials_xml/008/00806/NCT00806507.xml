	<detailed_description>Echocardiogram : Because heart-related side effect chemotherapy trastuzumab , regular doctor monitor heart 's function part routine care . You echocardiograms performed begin treatment , every 3 month . An echocardiogram us sound wave check heart 's health . If decide take part study , researcher take several additional picture heart regularly schedule echocardiograms . The additional picture make procedure take 5-10 minute longer regular echocardiogram . These picture view different way standard echocardiogram picture . Researchers hope view picture way help researcher find heart problem earlier usual test . Blood Tests : Blood ( 4 teaspoon time ) drawn routine blood draw occur close regularly schedule echocardiograms . The heart produce hormone call BNP NT-proBNP . These hormone measure blood . BNP NT-proBNP level higher heart work well . Researchers measure hormone time echocardiogram . Researchers hope learn whether measure hormone help identify heart-related side effect chemotherapy trastuzumab earlier usual test . Researchers also measure metabolic protein ( sugar acids ) blood . Researchers hope learn whether measure metabolic protein help identify heart-related side effect chemotherapy trastuzumab earlier usual test . Because protein , sugar acid level may temporarily change eat , ask eat overnight blood drawn . Study Visits : You 6 study visit around time echocardiogram . These visit occur take Herceptin , begin Herceptin , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month later . These study visit schedule day already make visit regular doctor . You make special visit hospital research study . During study visit , ask symptom may experience , medication may take . Your blood pressure heart rate measure . You also take quality life questionnaire study visit . This questionnaire ask cancer may interfere daily life . It take 15 minute complete . Length Study : You consider off-study complete 6 study visit . This investigational study . Up 100 patient take part multicenter study . Up 20 patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
