	<brief_summary>Acute leukemia life threaten illness strike people age . In addition survive direct effect disease , treatment leukemia generally require chemotherapy burden . Infection one common secondary problem face patient . Simple infection common easily treat aggressive antibiotic . However , treat progressive infection lead loss vital organ function term severe sepsis . Severe sepsis associate increase risk death need specialize care intensive care unit . Besides appropriate use antibiotic , little known clinical patient factor associate development severe sepsis . Recent evidence suggest certain practice like frequent transfusion blood product control glucose level effect outcome critically ill patient . In addition , advance knowledge certain gene may predispose people severe infection . It possible factor important people yet critically ill , risk development severe sepsis . This observational study look genetic , clinical therapeutic factor associate development severe sepsis . This help doctor understand treatment may helpful prevent serious complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary hypothesis : Hyperglycemia inpatient therapy AML associate increase mortality ( few hospital free day Day 60 , see ) . - H1a : Hyperglycemia result increase risk develop clinical sign infection ( fever ) . - H1b : Hyperglycemia associate increase risk develop severe sepsis onset clinical sign infection ( fever ) . H1b1 : Hyperglycemia associate development acute lung injury onset sign infection ( fever ) . - H1c : Hyperglycemia associate increase risk ICU admission . H1c1 : Hyperglycemia associate increase risk ICU admission severe sepsis . - H1d : Hyperglycemia associate increase risk death subject severe sepsis ( few hospital free day Day 60 , see ) . Secondary Aim : To investigate whether TSP-1 important modulate course sepsis-induced acute lung injury . Secondary hypothesis : In patient sepsis , increased level functional TSP-1 associate low incidence less severe course lung injury . - H2a : In human sepsis , increase TSP-1 level associate low incidence lung-injury . - H2b : In human sepsis , increase TSP-1 level associate less severe course lung-injury . - H2c : In human sepsis , patient Asn682Ser polymorphism TSP-1 gene associate high incidence lung-injury . - H2d In human sepsis , patient Asn682Ser polymorphism TSP-1 gene associate severe course lung-injury .</detailed_description>
