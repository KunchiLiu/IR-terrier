	<brief_summary>The primary objective study investigate whether give prophylactic metoprolol prior anthracycline trastuzumab therapy decrease incidence anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy . Patients randomize receive metoprolol treatment prior anthracycline trastuzumab treatment . The ejection fraction , measure nuclear ventriculography measure treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , control exploration . Consent obtain patient receive care cancer anthracycline trastuzumab University Of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center prior initiation anthracycline trastuzumab treatment initial oncology visit . Patients evaluate initial consultation oncology clinic time consent obtain , patient bradycardia ( HR less 50 ) contraindication exclude study . The patient randomly assign metoprolol vs. control group initial visit . Individuals control group receive study drug metoprolol group give prophylactic metoprolol prior initiation anthracycline trastuzumab treatment . Metoprolol tartrate provide patient randomized metoprolol group . Also time initial consultation , baseline MUGA obtain evaluation leave ventricular ejection fraction . Additionally , post-treatment MUGA obtain final course chemotherapy . Lastly , also initial visit , one vial blood obtain patient test genetic polymorphism , describe background section , may contribute response beta blockade prevention anthracycline trastuzumab induce cardiomyopathy . Each participant metoprolol group start 25 mg metoprolol tartrate twice day prior initiation anthracycline trastuzumab . After one week , dose increase 50 mg twice daily , tolerate . Prior increase dose , patient see cardiology research clinic study doctor evaluate side effect . After another week dose increase 100 mg twice daily . The dose decrease time side effect occur bradycardia HR le 50 hypotension SBP le 90 . The beta blocker hold two day prior post-treatment MUGA acutely affect heart rate , decrease heart rate would expect increase EF14 . Abrupt cessation metoprolol tartrate lead withdrawal beta-blockade . This study end post-treatment MUGA . The primary end point study change EF anthracycline trastuzumab treatment . A pill diary maintain document compliance study medication .</detailed_description>
