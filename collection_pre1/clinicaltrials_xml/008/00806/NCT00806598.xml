	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combine drug thymoglobulin , methylprednisolone , cyclosporine , G-CSF ( NeupogenTM NeulastaTM ) help control severe aplastic anemia ( AA ) hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . The safety combination therapy also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thymoglobulin Cyclosporine Patients With Aplastic Anemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aplastic anemia condition involve low level red blood cell ( anemia ) , white blood cell , platelet without evidence another bone marrow disease . Anemia lead fatigue , shortness breath , heart problem . Low platelet count lead bruise bleeding , low white blood cell count may cause increase risk infection , include pneumonia . Some treatment AA include transfusion , antibiotic combination anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) cyclosporine without steroid , growth factor G-CSF . For eligible donor , stem cell/bone marrow transplantation may use . MDS bone marrow disorder usually affect old adult . Treatment bone marrow failure accompany MDS usually supportive care red blood cell platelet transfusion , antibiotic , combination hematopoietic growth factor , may partially improve blood cell count . It often difficult distinguish hypoplastic variety MDS severe AA result bone marrow test low cell count number . Earlier study show patient hypoplastic MDS , low blood count respond immunosuppressive treatment ATG cyclosporine . ATG make horse plasma . Thymoglobulin type ATG make rabbit plasma . Thymoglobulin successfully use treat patient AA previously treat horse ATG whose disease return . G-CSF growth factor help raise white cell count receive chemotherapy . Methylprednisolone steroid commonly use treat number medical condition associate people 's abnormal immune response . If find eligible take part study , receive combination thymoglobulin , cyclosporine , G-CSF , methylprednisolone . Treatment thymoglobulin , dose depend age weight . It give vein several hour day total 5 day . You receive steroid methylprednisolone vein dose thymoglobulin decrease risk develop allergic reaction thymoglobulin . After 5 day receive methylprednisolone vein , start take mouth day decrease dose 3 week . The first 5 day treatment give M. D. Anderson treat outside hospital rest time unless complication develop . You start cyclosporine well G-CSF completion thymoglobulin . You take cyclosporine mouth twice day 6 month . Your physician may continue cyclosporine long discretion . You receive G-CSF injection skin 3 month ( long ) day discretion treat physician start time cyclosporine start . You also receive antibiotic pill help decrease risk infection . You take levofloxacin , valacyclovir , fluconazole , similar antibiotic mouth every day length study treat physician find appropriate . If history heart disease take aspirin , treat physician may consider stop aspirin low platelet count result disease . This may increase risk heart attack . You blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) twice week first month every 2-4 week end study check blood count improve . The level cyclosporine blood also check time . It require 1 tablespoon test . Monitoring cyclosporine level routine test do patient receive drug order avoid toxic blood level side effect . At 3 month , repeat bone marrow biopsy aspiration well blood test ( 3 tablespoon ) evaluate response treatment . You continue cyclosporine 6 month ( long doctor feel interest ) receive G-CSF 3 month ( long interest ) . If develop serious side effect disease get bad time take study . At time doctor feel best possible response treatment come study , blood test ( 3 tablespoon ) repeat . Your doctor continue remain touch ensure disease remain control . This may do arrange follow-up visit phone mean communication . This investigational study . All drug use study FDA approve commercially available . Their use together study experimental . A total 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
