	<brief_summary>Pedestrian injury among leading cause morbidity mortality American child age 7-8 , exist behavior-oriented intervention achieve modest success . One limitation exist intervention fail provide child repeat practice need develop complex perceptual cognitive skill require safe pedestrian activity . Virtual reality ( VR ) offer highly promising technique train child pedestrian safety skill . VR permit repeat unsupervised practice without risk injury ; automate feedback child success failure crossing ; adjustment traffic density speed match child 's skill level ; appeal fun environment training . The propose research design test efficacy virtual reality tool train child pedestrian safe street-crossing behavior . A randomized control trial conduct four equal-sized group child age 7-8 ( total N = 240 ) . One group receive train interactive immersive virtual pedestrian environment . The virtual environment , already develop , demonstrate face , construct , convergent validity . The second group receive pedestrian safety training via video computer strategy widely use American school today . The third group receive judge efficacious treatment currently available , individualized behavioral training streetside location . The fourth final group serve no-contact control group . All participant group expose range field- laboratory-based measure pedestrian skill baseline post-intervention visit , well six-month follow-up assessment . Primary analysis conduct linear mixed model design test change time four intervention group . We hypothesize child active learn group increase pedestrian safety skill , large increase among child virtual reality group .</brief_summary>
