	<brief_summary>This study perform University Washington . Forty subject Cystic Fibrosis enrol , 20 randomize usual care arm 20 randomize intervention arm . All subject enrol 6 month 3 study visit . One baseline , midpoint , final . The intervention arm subject may study visit depend respiratory symptom . The intervention arm subject perform home spirometry twice week PiKo-6 hand hold spirometer . They also home-based telemonitoring system connect phone line . They prompt twice week answer question regard health via telemonitor . Subjects able utilize home-based telemonitoring system answer question regard health via internet home computer . If subject 's spirometry fall great 10 % baseline CF respiratory symptom change 3 8 respiratory symptom capture telemonitor questionnaire , subject call research staff clinically evaluate study PIs within three day .

	<detailed_description>The study design single center , randomize non-blinded controlled clinical trial compare usual care program early identification treatment pulmonary exacerbation adult CF . Forty subject enrol University Washington 20 subject randomize usual care arm , 20 randomize intervention arm . Usual care define regular quarterly CF visit acute visit trigger call patient clinic . Neither home assessment spirometry standardize home symptom assessment component usual care . Treatment pulmonary exacerbation base standard protocol employ standard definition treatment regimen . This study employ current standardize CF pulmonary exacerbation order use University Washington . Usual care arm subject 3 study visit baseline , midpoint , final , period 6 month . The early intervention protocol employ twice week assessment home spirometry CF respiratory symptom ; employ home base monitoring system Philips call Philips Remote Patient Monitoring system ( TeleStation ) . The home monitoring system connect patient 's phone line ; system currently use clinical practice care patient diabetes heart failure . Subjects home phone line answer CF respiratory question via internet home computer . The home spirometry do use PiKo-6 hand hold spirometer 84 spirometry value . If subject 's spirometry fall great 10 % baseline CF respiratory symptom change 3 8 respiratory symptom capture questionnaire , subject call research staff clinically evaluate study PIs within three day . This evaluation include history physical exam along repeat spirometry clinic . The intervention arm subject 3 study visit baseline , midpoint , final , period 6 month .
