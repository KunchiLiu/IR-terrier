	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause mortality woman . In fact , CVD responsible third death woman worldwide half death woman 50 year age develop country . Historically , woman underrepresented clinical trial . The lack good trial evidence concern sex-specific outcome lead assumption CVD treatment woman , turn may result inadequate diagnosis suboptimal management , greatly affect outcomes . This knowledge gap may also explain cardiovascular health woman improve fast men . Over last decade , mortality rate men steadily decline , woman remain stable . The treadmill exercise test classic initial investigation diagnosis coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , significant ST depression ECG commonly use indicator positive test . Compared men , woman know ST depression less likely associate CAD . False positive rate treadmill exercise testing report high 67 % , positive predictive value around 48-50 % . Coronary angiography one frequently perform procedure woman ; however , non-obstructive ( ie , &lt; 50 % stenosis ) CAD frequently report . Additionally , approximately 30 % woman undergo PTCA positive exercise test find normal coronary artery . A successful outcome current study significantly improve non-invasive diagnosis CAD woman may reduce number unnecessary invasive procedure perform .</detailed_description>
