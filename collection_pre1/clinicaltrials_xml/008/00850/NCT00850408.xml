	<brief_summary>Weakness arm hand result long-term disability many person suffer stroke . After initial recovery phase , limited gain achieve retrain weak limb perform daily task . However , new treatment strategy repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) show promise enhance motor recovery stroke . rTMS noninvasive technique modify brain activity aim improve motor function correct abnormal pattern occur stroke . We believe give rTMS right therapy session prepare brain patient well able participate benefit training hand arm . The goal study test well new strategy work improve recovery people mild moderate weakness arm hand stroke . Participants receive magnetic stimulation movement area brain prior arm hand training series eight session . We evaluate change hand arm function intervention one month later see change maintain . We also test whether group people benefit others intervention . If improvement hand arm function observe intervention , test rigourously future clinical trial participant randomly assign different treatment condition . This research show whether brain stimulation use improve effectiveness rehabilitation care .</brief_summary>
