	<brief_summary>Pulmonary hypertension , complication associate increase risk death , common patient sickle cell disease . Despite frequency , remain standard treatment complication patient sickle cell disease . In small study , investigator evaluate effect monthly transfusion red blood cell patient sickle cell disease-associated pulmonary hypertension . The investigator speculate increase hemoglobin level decrease amount sickle red blood cell , patient would experience improvement PHT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Chronic Red Blood Cell Transfusion Sickle Cell Disease-Associated Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) age , recurrent vaso-occlusive episode lead progressive end-organ damage . Pulmonary hypertension ( PHT ) represent example end-organ damage . Pulmonary hypertension , common complication patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , result shorten survival . The high mortality report SCD patient PHT appear occur particularly patient moderate severe elevation pulmonary artery pressure . The overall objective proposal evaluate effect chronic red blood cell transfusion PHT SCD . We hypothesize increase hemoglobin concentration decrease amount HbS , patient would experience improvement PHT . Thus , specific aim clinical trial evaluate effect RBC transfusion pulmonary hypertension SCD , well effect chronic RBC transfusion plasma marker thrombin generation , platelet activation , nitric oxide metabolite . Study subject transfuse monthly 6 month investigate safety efficacy RBC transfusion SCD patient PHT . All pack red blood cell extend antigen match C , D , E Kell minimize risk alloimmunization . Subjects receive routine treatment SCD . Specific outcome variable evaluate 1 month , 3 month , 6 month . All study subject receive simple transfusion pack red blood cell achieve post-transfusion hemoglobin ( Hb ) great 10 g/dL . For subject may baseline hemoglobin post transfusion Hb would exceed 10 g/dL , require limited exchange transfusion , i.e . phlebotomy 1 unit blood , follow transfusion 2 unit pack RBC . All study subject return assessment safety and/or efficacy measure every two week first month , subsequently every four week till completion study . Study subject experience document worsen disease ( decreased SaO2 , worsen 6-minute walk ) least two consecutive follow visit take study . At end study , subject option continue chronic RBC transfusion .</detailed_description>
