	<brief_title>Study Early Detection Drug Interactions Older Hospitalized Patients Using Line Software</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A drug interaction ( DI ) mutual action two drug way increase action , even toxic level , reduce minimum . Adverse drug event ( ADE ) important health problem . In book To Err Is Human : Building Safer Health System author Kohn , Corrigan Donaldson `` Committee Quality Health Care America , Institute Medicine '' ( U.S.A. ) express 2 every 100 hospital admission due ADE . That result average increase U $ D 4,700 extra admission 2.8 million U $ D annually 700-bed teaching hospital . In study consider direct cost . No indirect cost take account , like day work , rehabilitation , death , lose quality life , etc . In 2003 , cohort study do people Medicare elder 65 year old , detect 50.1 ADE / 1000 person year . Of number ADE 13.8 consider preventable . In Switzerland 3.3 % hospitalisation consider due ADE . Among ADE , DI important part problem . In Canada demonstrate certain drug association responsible increase number hospital admission . They would occur prescription would properly control never do . In Mexico 3.8 % patient elder 50 year old receive prescription drug , avoid accord interaction . In hospital setting DI endanger even health people 's life . In Spain demonstrate prevalence clinical relevant DI 3 % hospitalized patient , Switzerland percentage rise 11 % . This phenomenon increase later year , Rotterdam DI compromise lethal risk patient elder 70 year old , climb 1.5 % 1992 2.9 % 2005 . Drug interaction directly proportional : number administer drug ( &gt; 2 drug &gt; 4 ) ; age patient number prescribe physician . Older person , detriment physical condition pathology suffer , prone suffer DI prescribe drug even herbal medicine . In Brazil ambulatory patient elder 60 year old 2.5 pathology diagnose consume average 1.3 2.3 drug . During hospitalisation number prescribe drug reach 9.9 13.6 per patient . In survey do six European country number drug consume ambulatory patient 7 . In Argentina accord Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas Censos ( INDEC ) number citizen elder 65 year old 3,587,620 ( 9.89 % total population ) . Unfortunately information polypharmacy prevalent pathology INDEC medical database national institution web site . In 1995 , publish article JAMA state possibility 28 % ADE could prevent non-obstetric hospitalize adult . Fifty six percent due mistake do prescription , 34 % administration , 6 % transcription indication 4 % dispensation . This astonishing result pose need develop strategy cut number . Many list drug potential produce ADE develop prevent DI relate drug damage . Beers criterion ( BC ) one example . In Amsterdam demonstrate 80 % improvement drug regimens patient elder 81 year old therapeutic indication review adjust use BC Medication Appropriateness Index suffer ADE . In study , list 10 drug combination also use show benefit . In Argentina , Adminstración Nacional de Medicamentos , Alimentos Tecnología ( ANMAT ) publish web page list 16 risky drug , consider disadvantage pharmacological action , information usefulness . Much software develop later year alert physician DI . Some even sensible search DI bedside , software overestimate prevalence serious DI . The usage computerized alert system prescription significantly reduce potential ADE , however many physician tend override different reason . Finally Cochrane´s review show reduction hospitalization day drug toxic effect use computerized warning system drug dosing . The grow number drug , apart always well-proven benefit , implies risk health ; specially sick old people even hospitalization . Nowadays software alert physician DI ADE could help prevent real contribution still matter debate . For reason develop trial test usefulness line software detect DI hospitalize elder patient .</detailed_description>
