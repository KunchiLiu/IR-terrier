	<brief_summary>As type 2 diabetes prevalence increase United States , burden diabetes fall group great barrier care , language cultural difference , low economic resource . Healthy People 2010 target diabetes one six diseases elimination racial ethnic health disparity . These disparity extend US Territory American Samoa , proportion adult &gt; 18 year diabetes 19.6 % 2002 , compare 6.4 % US adult . There report diabetes intervention Samoans US . The overall purpose application translate recent advance diabetes care clinical practice American Samoan community improve method health care delivery method diabetes self management . We conduct randomized clinical trial test effectiveness community health worker ( CHW ) primary-care coordinate intervention provide outreach , education support 352 type 2 diabetes patient family American Samoa . The CHW intervention utilize evidence-based algorithm protocol prompt risk behavior intervention , communication health care team , visit schedule . The individual treatment action plan also guide Precede-Proceed Model . The outcomes one-year follow-up include glycosolated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , cardiovascular disease risk factor , diet exercise behavior , adherence diabetes care guideline . The study hypothesis diabetes patient CHW trial arm lower HbA1c level , low cardiovascular disease risk factor level , increase exercise behavior healthy dietary intake great adherence diabetes care adherence prescribe medication , keep medical appointment diabetes care specialty referral . The intervention build upon best clinical practice CHWs diabetes care translate effective strategy American Samoans , also extend prior CHW research , use model potentially replicable ethnic minority population suffer burden diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We perform clinical trial test effectiveness community health worker ( CHW ) primary-care coordinate intervention provide outreach , education support diabetes patient family . The outcomes one-year follow-up include glycosolated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , CVD risk factor , diet exercise behavior , adherence diabetes care guideline . The intervention build upon best practice date CHWs , translate effective strategy Samoans , ethnic minority population prior intervention research , also extend prior CHW research , use model potentially replicable anywhere use outreach strategy context primary care . This application build current limited activity CHWs Tafuna Family Health Center ( TFHC ) , primary care health center establish 1998 , operate American Samoa Government Department Health , designate community health center U.S. Bureau Primary Health Care 2003 . We conduct randomize controlled trial test effectiveness CHW outreach intervention , compare usual care ( UC ) wait-list control group . The specific aim : A.1 . To improve control diabetes : We hypothesize CHW outreach intervention group great one-year reduction glycosolated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) level compare UC group . A.2 . To improve cardiovascular risk factor : We hypothesize CHW outreach intervention group great one-year reduction systolic diastolic blood pressure , BMI , abdominal circumference compare UC Group . A.3 . To improve diet physical activity behavior : We hypothesize diabetes patient randomize CHW intervention great one-year increase favorable dietary physical activity behavior associate self-management diabetes compare UC group . A.4 . To improve adherence process diabetes care . The CHW group higher percent diabetes patient follow American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) standard care : 1 ) least two HBA1c test last year ( least 3 month apart ) , 2 ) percent patient documentation self-management goal past 12 month , 3 ) percent patient dental exam past year , 4 ) percent patient dilate eye exam past year , 5 ) percent patient documented foot exam past year . We hypothesize CHW intervention outperform UC variables one year .</detailed_description>
