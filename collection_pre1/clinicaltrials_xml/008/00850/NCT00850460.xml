	<brief_summary>The propose study focus possible effect statin muscle strength become tire easily , quality life , measurement understand muscle able fully utilize fat . The investigator specifically interested statin user impact muscle symptom daily activity quality life . This study hypothesize patient likely statin-associated myopathy metabolic dysregulation fuel utilization compare patient continue statin , placebo show : 1. improved Individualized Neuromuscular Quality Life ( INQoL ) Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) score ( primary end point ) 2. alleviation muscle symptom , 3. increase utilization fatty acids fuel source reflect metabolic test result 4. decreased intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) 5. improved insulin sensitivity .</brief_summary>
