	<brief_summary>Isoniazid preventive therapy ( IPT ) well studied clinical intervention primary secondary prevention active tuberculosis ( TB ) infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis . It widely use industrialized country TB outbreak management , focus high risk group close contact family , congregate setting , workplace amongst others . Individuals infect Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) markedly high risk acquire TB-infection develop consequently active TB , make HIV-infected individual target population IPT . Studies IPT HIV infect person ninety demonstrate efficacy IPT prevention active TB Sub -Saharan Africa recent study suggest protective effect remain present individual antiretroviral therapy . Despite proven efficacy IPT intervention take HIV TB control program Africa burden TB/HIV high . The reason low uptake IPT many vary include fear expansion isoniazid resistance subsequently development multi -drug resistant TB widespread use IPT . Additionally screen protocol exclude active TB selecting person IPT uniformly agree upon . There also concern programmes design provide IPT may shift TB control program primary responsibility find treat active TB . Finally unclear programme , HIV TB control programme , primary responsibility manage provision IPT intervention . The World Health Organization technical agency engage global TB control recently re-emphasize need scale IPT . In proposal outline operational research study evaluate introduction IPT community level measure effectiveness prevent TB . The study base context expansion Community-Based Direct Observed Therapy Short Course ( CB-DOTS ) , home-based care concept HIV prevention positive ( PwPs ) , real opportunity focus household source HIV-associated tuberculosis . The study design cluster randomize trial . It compare incidence TB household contact include child 5 identify TB/HIV co-infected patient , receive IPT proactive community intervention control group community handle `` usual way '' . In intervention group household contact index case HIV positive , smear positive PTB visit home consenting contact screen active TB use simple questionnaire . Those found fit receive isoniazid 300mg ( 5 mg per Kg child ) daily 6 month , regardless HIV-status . Those found fit refer evaluation near TB diagnostic centre . In control group , routine care follow national guideline offer . This consist contact invitation assessment eligibility IPT , especially , child le 5 year . Both group follow monthly household visit . Follow total 24 month include six month IPT provide . A confidential HIV screen test provide consent contact intervention control group appropriate counseling . The primary outcome incidence TB intervention control household contact . The difference incidence two group measure efficacy intervention . In addition efficacy intervention estimate stratified HIV status household contact data allows . Secondary outcome incidence adverse event , incidence TB-related symptom , measure uptake IPT ( proportion contact start discontinue IPT , treatment adherence ) programmatic indicator , i.e . percentage person eligible IPT resource need .</brief_summary>
