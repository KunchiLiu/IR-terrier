	<criteria>1 . Patient male female , age 18 80 year old . 2 . Patient weigh ≥ 50 kg ( 110 lb ) . 3 . Patient urinary incontinence result neurogenic detrusor overactivity period least 3 month prior screen result spinal cord injury multiple sclerosis , determine documented patient history . In addition : Spinal cord injury patient must stable neurological injury level T1 ( cervical injury exclude ) occur ≥ 6 month prior screen . Multiple sclerosis patient must clinically stable investigator 's opinion ≥ 3 month prior screen Expanded Disability Status Scale score ≤ 6.5 . 4 . Patient detrusor overactivity ( define phasic rise bladder pressure fill phase determine urodynamics ) demonstrate screening period Day 1 ( prior randomization ) . 5 . Patient able complete study requirement include bladder diary completion attend study visit ( telephone clinic ) , opinion investigator . 6 . Patient adequately manage one anticholinergic urinary incontinence , opinion investigator . Not adequately manage define inadequate response intolerable side effect least one month anticholinergic therapy optimize dose . 7 . For patient take anticholinergic medication neurogenic overactive bladder , dose stable patient willing maintain dosing study participation . 8 . Patient negative pregnancy result female childbearing potential . The following criterion also require entry study Randomization/Day 1 : 9 . Patient experience ≥ 14 episode urinary incontinence per week 2 incontinentfree day determine completion patient bladder diary screening period . 10 . Patient currently use willing use clean intermittent catheterization ( CIC ) empty bladder ( indwell catheter permit ) . Patients currently CIC willing maintain establish CIC frequency throughout study . Caregiver may perform CIC . 11 . Patients negative urine culture result must take antibiotic medication 3 day immediately prior Randomization/Day 1 agree continue antibiotic medication least 3 day follow treatment . Patients positive urine culture result indicate urinary tract infection ( UTI ) must take antibiotic identify organism sensitive least 5 day immediately prior Randomization/Day 1 continue 3 day follow procedure ( longer need ) patient asymptomatic UTI day treatment . A UTI define either positive urine culture result bacteriuria count &gt; 105 CFU/mL conjoint leukocyturia &gt; 5/hpf screen positive urine culture , investigator 's opinion , require antibiotic therapy . 1 . Patient history evidence pelvic urological abnormality include limited following : elevate serum creatinine &gt; 2 time upper limit normal ( reference range ) history current hematuria , 1 ) hematuria determine pathologic condition 2 ) uninvestigated interstitial cystitis opinion investigator bladder stone within 6 month screen surgery bladder disease detrusor overactivity may impact bladder function exception surgery bladder stone ( &gt; 6 month ) stress incontinence , uterine prolapse , rectocele , cystocele ( &gt; 1 year ) screen 2 . Patient previous current botulinum toxin therapy serotype urological condition , treatment within 3 month Randomization/Day 1 condition use . 3 . Patient immunize botulinum toxin serotype . 4 . Patient discontinue anticholinergic medication overactive bladder &lt; 21 day prior Randomization/Day 1 . 5 . Patient history current diagnosis bladder cancer urine cytology result may indicate bladder cancer rule investigator Randomization/Day 1 . Suspicious urine cytology abnormality require investigator 's assessment ensure finding indicative malignancy . 6 . Patient male previous current diagnosis prostate cancer . Patients PSA level great 4.0 ng/mL require biopsy rule prostate cancer , unless prostatic biopsy perform patient within past 12 month . 7 . Patient 24 hour total volume void &gt; 3000 mL urine determine completion patient bladder diary collect one consecutive 24 hour period 7 day diary collection period prior Randomization/Day1 . 8 . Patient post void residual volume 200 mL patient micturate mixed catheterization/spontaneous micturition pattern . 9 . Patient active genital infection , genital wart , either concurrently within 4 week prior screen . 10 . Patient us antiplatelet anticoagulant therapy use medication anticoagulative effect within 3 day prior treatment . Some medication may need withhold &gt; 3 day per clinical judgment investigator ( refer Section 8.2.2 Prohibited Medications/Treatments detail ) . 11 . Patient hemophilia clot factor deficiency disorder cause bleed diatheses . 12 . Patient concurrent treatment treatment within 6 month Randomization/Day 1 capsaicin resiniferatoxin . 13 . Patient currently use plan use implant nonimplantable electrostimulation/neuromodulation device treatment overactive bladder . 14 . Patient know allergy sensitivity component study medication , anesthetic antibiotic product associate treatment general study procedure . 15 . Patient medical condition may put patient increase risk exposure BOTOX® include diagnose myasthenia gravis , EatonLambert syndrome amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . 16 . Patient female pregnant , nurse plan pregnancy study , childbearing potential unable unwilling use reliable form contraception study . 17 . Patient currently previously participate another therapeutic device study within 30 day screen . 18 . Patient condition situation , , investigator 's opinion , put patient significant risk , could confound study result , may interfere significantly patient 's participation study .</criteria>
