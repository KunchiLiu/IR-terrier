	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , also know sickle cell anemia , inherit blood disease cause intense pain episode may lead organ failure . Preliminary study show adult SCD may brain abnormality contribute problem cognitive functioning , include attention memory difficulty . This study use brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) neuropsychological test examine difference cognitive function adult SCD treat anemia monthly blood transfusion 6 month versus adult SCD receive usual care 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining Cognitive Function Brain Abnormalities Adults With Sickle Cell Disease - Pilot Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCD inherit blood disorder . Symptoms include anemia , infection , organ damage , intense episode pain , call `` sickle cell crisis . '' In past , SCD consider fatal disease , many people SCD die young age . Due advance medical care , people SCD living longer live ; however , often experience deterioration quality life due progressive organ failure . Past research suggest child SCD commonly frontal lobe dysfunction syndrome , brain disorder affect cognitive function area attention , concentration , information processing , decision making . Often time , however , neurocognitive brain disorder diagnose treated people SCD . In preliminary brain imaging study , least half adult participant SCD visible cognitive dysfunction , participant without SCD rarely visible change brain . Brain dysfunction may one important least-studied problem affect adult SCD . Most people SCD anemia , low level red blood cell , cell carry oxygen body 's tissue , especially brain . Research show people anemia SCD , memory attention problem decrease receive treatment anemia . The purpose study determine whether people SCD receive monthly blood transfusion treat anemia experience great cognitive functioning adult SCD receive usual care . The first phase study observational study enrol adult SCD control group healthy adult SCD . Study procedure include questionnaire , neuropsychological testing , MRI test . At end first phase , participant ask willing take part second phase overall study future . Enrollment first phase end February 2008 . This current pilot study second phase overall study . In study , participant begin complete questionnaire , medical history review , physical exam , neurological exam , blood collection . Women provide urine sample pregnancy test . An MRI neuropsychological testing also occur . Participants randomly assign receive either blood transfusion usual care 6 month . Participants assign blood transfusion receive transfusion every 3 4 week 6 month . Before transfusion , participant undergo blood collection review medical history medication history . Participants assign usual care receive telephone call study researcher Months 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , time medical medication history review . At study visit Months 3 6 , participant also undergo blood collection . At Month 6 , participant complete health quality life questionnaire , neuropsychological testing , MRI .</detailed_description>

( This pilot transfusion 6 month transfusion utilize . The likelihood iron overload induce toxicity transfusion 6 month small . Furthermore , ferritin disproportionately elevate SCD overestimate iron burden . Therefore , quantitative liver iron and/or ferritin level include criteria exclusion . ) Major infarct identify Phase I MRI Currently Procrit relate drug stimulates red blood cell production In addition exclusion criterion list , people complete Phase I ( complete Phase I 1 year prior enrollment study ) disqualify enrollment study meet follow criterion : Overt stroke Previous evidence abnormal MRI compute axial tomography ( CT ) scan small periventricular watershed lesion History head injury result neurological symptom medical visit Abnormal neurological exam focal finding Alcohol consumption exceed 14 drinks/week female 21 drinks/week male Drug abuse , define use nonprescribed medication History claustrophobia and/or presence metallic implant pacemaker , surgical aneurysm clip , know metal fragment embed body Baseline blood pressure great 140/90 mm Hg two repeat measurement .
