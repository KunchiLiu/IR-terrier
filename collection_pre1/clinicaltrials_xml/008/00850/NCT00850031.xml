	<detailed_description>The loss near vision ability perform task require near vision part normal age process . This natural transformation eye occur result loss accommodation crystalline lens , condition know presbyopia . The crystalline lens responsible accommodative property human eye , establish Young 1801 , 200 year ago.1 During accommodation , ciliary muscle contract , decrease tension zonule , allow crystalline lens thicken , increase refractive power . This mechanism accommodation thicken lens provide eye adequate refractive power near vision . The loss accommodation age result change crystalline lens composition prevent natural accommodative process occur . This associated gradual loss near vision without external correction , generally form spectacle . The AcuFocusâ„¢ ACI 7000PDT represent new technology base well-established concept small-aperture optic . In early camera , depth focus control reduce aperture light enters . The small aperture , great depth focus . This concept also apply human eye . In eye presbyopic emmetrope , lens accommodate sufficiently focus light ray near object onto single point retina . Thus , point object image blur circle retina , image extend object degrade well . If opaque disc small aperture center place front eye , peripheral ray obscure central ray pas unaffected . Since peripheral ray enter eye large angle , create large blur circle retinal image plane . Eliminating peripheral ray reduces size blur circle , improve image resolution . In presbyopic subject , object closer arm 's length focus behind retina , thus create blur retinal image ( compose blur circle ) . A small aperture inlay place front eye subject allow see near reduce size blur circle . AcuFocus , Inc. develop stationary intracorneal inlay design create small aperture effect . The implant intend place intra-stromally either corneal flap corneal pocket . Placement ACI center pupil non-dominant eye . The ACI expect increase depth focus eye reduce circle blur . Based theoretical calculation small aperture optic , ACI expect provide presbyopic subject improvement near intermediate vision .</detailed_description>
