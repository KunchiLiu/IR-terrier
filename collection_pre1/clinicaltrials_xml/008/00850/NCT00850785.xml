	<brief_summary>This pilot single institution study DRibble vaccination + GM-CSF patient stage IIIB IV NSCLC undergone 0-1 chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease . The primary objective trial evaluate immune response induce autologous DRibble vaccine vivo vitro autologous allogeneic lung cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Tumor DRibble Vaccine Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten patient enrol . Study treatment follow : Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 give day 1 . Intradermal vaccination DRibbles 5-20 x 106 cell equivalent per vaccine begin 14 day docetaxel . Immediately follow vaccination , subcutaneous infusion GM-CSF ( 50 micrograms/24 hr ) initiate . GM-CSF infused vaccination site 6 day use CADD-MS 3 pump . A second docetaxel injection give day 29 follow second vaccination 14 day later 3 additional vaccine give 2-week interval . Following vaccination , GM-CSF infuse 6 day via CADD-MS 3 pump . Peripheral blood obtain immune monitoring vaccination . DTH autologous tumor DRibble vaccine test first fifth vaccine . A second leukapheresis immune monitoring obtain 12 week . Clinical tumor response assess fifth vaccination unless clinical evidence tumor progression occur sooner . Immune response assess DTH , T-cell function , T-cell migration vaccine sit cytokine release assay . Sophisticated flow cytometry assay use detect active T-cell subset . Safety monitor physical laboratory exam vaccine visit adverse event record report appropriate . Clinical response assess tumor measurement CT scan and/or physical exam study entry 12 week . PFS OS record .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stage IIIB IV NSCLC . Adequate pleural effusion ( &gt; 600 cc ) subcutaneous metastasis ( &gt; 1 cc ) DRibble vaccine production . Measurable evaluable disease . No one prior chemotherapy regimen advance NSCLC . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 Age &gt; 18 year . CD4 count &gt; 200 per cc . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test must avoid become pregnant treatment . Men must avoid father child treatment . This exclusion require due toxicity docetaxel may form fetus , spermatogenesis nursing child . Also , pregnancy may alter immune function may limit treatment efficacy . Ability give inform consent comply protocol . Patients history psychiatric illness must judge able understand fully investigational nature study risk associate therapy . Anticipated lifespan minimum 6 month . Prior vaccine gene therapy cancer . Untreated brain metastasis spinal cord compression . Active autoimmune disease . Active malignancy . Known hypersensitivity docetaxel . HIV positive and/or Hepatitis B C positive . Patients receive concurrent investigational treatment . Other medical psychiatric condition opinion Principal Investigator would preclude safe participation protocol .</criteria>
