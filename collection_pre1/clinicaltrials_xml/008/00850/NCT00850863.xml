	<brief_summary>COPD rank number 3 WHO list important disease worldwide disease increase mortality . The pathogenesis cigarette smoke-induced COPD obscure , therefore insight need design effective anti-inflammatory agent . Recently become clear cigarette smoke-induced inflammation present lung also blood , systemic inflammation important consequence clinical expression COPD . The investigator hypothesize healthy individual susceptible cigarette smoking demonstrate higher aberrant systemic inflammatory response cigarette smoke . This susceptibility cause heterogeneous factor associate various polymorphic gene interact environment . Objective : - To study systemic inflammation individual susceptible develop COPD . - To characterize switch chronicity systemic inflmmatory response COPD - To determine whether type severity systemic inflammation contribute clinical outcome COPD - To compare subject susceptible develop COPD peripheral blood , corticosteroid responsiveness vitro , unravel underlying mechanism . - To study role candidate gene may play role development fix airway obstruction , identify clue patient 's responsiveness specific drug - To develop new biological clinical marker early diagnosis monitoring COPD - To define possible mediator involve early induction COPD susceptible smoker , define new drug target</brief_summary>
