	<brief_summary>Postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) serious complication . The development therapeutic strategy prevention treatment condition require identification subgroup patient great incidence POCD . Several retrospective analysis raise possibility surgery risk factor accelerate progression Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Moreover , increase evidence inflammatory mechanism involve pathogenesis AD . Major surgery associate profound systemic inflammatory response . Consequently , reasonable suggest link major surgery postoperative development AD patient already high risk complication , e.g . elderly mild cognitive impairment . In addition , several laboratory investigation suggest anesthetic agent increase amyloid peptide level well enhance oligomerization protein . The significance finding , however , unknown . This clinical study seek correlate perioperative inflammatory response , perioperative change amyloid-beta protein level ( marker AD ) neurocognitive functional outcome elderly risk POCD . This knowledge exist , essential effort plan perioperative care reduce incidence POCD well improve functional recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We recruit 50 patient 65 year old schedule spine surgery . The design utilizes prospective serial assessment . The enrolled 50 surgical subject evaluate preoperatively postoperatively 6 time-points ( preoperatively , inta-op , post op day 1 , post op day 7 , three month six month ) use widely accept set neurocognitive test , multiple index functional recovery , well blood test plasma biomarkers inflammation β-amyloids . Enrollees divide 2 group : 25 patient mild cognitive impairment ( diagnosed clinical assessment ) 25 normal elderly patient . The definition normal elderly include : 1 ) . Global Deterioration Scale ( GDS ) &lt; 3 Mini-Mental Exam Score ( MMSE ) &gt; 27 ; 2 ) . Performance neurocognitive testing ( include memory ) within 1.5 Standard Deviation ( SD ) age match normative data ; 3 ) . The informant interview confirm functional impairment subject . The definition MCI include : self-reported memory functional complains , history memory decline functional change corroborate knowledgeable informant , clinical interview result GDS=3 high MMSE=26 low .</detailed_description>
