	<brief_summary>Freezing gait ( FOG ) common yet poorly understood motor symptom person Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Previous study show bilateral uncoordinated gait gait asymmetry relate FOG , intensive treadmill train PD patient improve gait . However , group yet study effect robot-assisted gait training ( RAGT ) FOG . The primary aim study collect pilot data effect robot-assisted gait training reduce episode freeze PD . Subjects Parkinson 's disease experience freeze gait recruit enrol follow informed consent screen eligibility . Each 10 training session last approximately one hour . Neurological evaluation , test gait parameter , quality life assessment conduct . Participants also ask return 1- 3-month post-intervention assessment see train lasting effect . Approximately 10-20 subject enrol , study last 6 month . Robot-assisted gait training conduct Lokomat ( treadmill supplemental robot-assistance move hip knee ) . We monitor change freeze conduct various assessment . There approximately 1 million Americans PD US . PD significant cause reduce functional ability quality life , progressive disability . Patients PD FOG indicate one disturbing symptom , effective treatment . Therefore important additional alternative intervention FOG test develop .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis idiopathic PD UK Brain Bank criterion , without significant neurological problem . Men woman age 1885 year . History FOG selfreport verify MD . Must able walk unassisted freeze use device prevent fall overcome freeze exclusionary . ( Device use visual cueing ) . Cognitively unable understand instruction require study . Presence medical neurological infirmity might contribute significant gait dysfunction ( severe OA , foot drop , sensory neuropathy , blindness , joint replacement , etc . ) , determine physician screening exam . Cardiovascular : recent MI &lt; 4 wk , uncontrolled HTN &gt; 190/110 mmHg . History uncontrolled diabetes . Significant symptoms orthostasis standing . Circulatory problem , history vascular claudication 3+ pitting edema . Body weight 100 kg . Lower extremity injury limit range motion function . Joint problem ( hip leg ) limit range motion cause pain movement despite treatment . Unstable fracture . Pressure sores skin breakdown area contact body harness Lokomat apparatus . Chronic ongoing alcohol drug abuse . Active depression , anxiety psychosis might interfere use equipment test . Inability participate complete training session . Patients determine atypical parkinsonian syndrome neurologist . Patients PD undergone deep brain stimulation . Primarily wheelchair bound .</criteria>
