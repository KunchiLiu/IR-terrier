	<brief_summary>Phase 1 - Optimization Phase : Primary Objective : The primary objective Phase 1 study determine time point maximal Circulating Tumor Cell Burden ( CTCB ) occur follow standard vertebroplasty Kyphoplasty procedure relative baseline CTCB . Phase 2 - Comparison Phase : Primary Objective : The primary objective Phase 2 study determine change CTCB baseline post-treatment measure use CellSearchâ„¢ Assay compare average change treatment group without use Cavity SpineWand . Secondary Objectives : - To determine change self-reported pain level baseline post-treatment measure use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) spine pain compare average change pain level treatment group . - To determine change pain status baseline post-treatment measure use Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) compare average change pain status treatment group . - To determine change baseline post-treatment M.D . Anderson Cancer Center Symptom Inventory ( MDASI ) compare average change treatment group . - To determine change baseline post-treatment time walk 50-foot distance compare average change treatment group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Kyphoplasty Vertebroplasty : Kyphoplasty vertebroplasty type surgery use treat broken bone back , may cause cancer . Both procedure involve inject mixture medical cement break bone ( ) back . The cement design harden become permanent part bone , support bone like `` internal cast '' bring back original shape . The amount cement vary person person , could , example , anywhere fraction teaspoon full teaspoon . The main difference 2 procedure kyphoplasty involves use small medical type balloon , vertebroplasty use balloon . Vertebroplasty also use slightly small needle inject cement . The Study Device : The Cavity SpineWand rod-shaped surgical tool design use type energy call plasma order destroy tissue low temperature surgical method . This may help lessen damage nearby tissue . In study , Cavity SpineWand use remove tissue ( soft tissue , bone tissue , , vary person person ) , include part cancerous tumor area break bone ( ) . This design make extra room cement inject , either vertebroplasty procedure kyphoplasty procedure . Screening Tests : Before receive treatment study , `` screening test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . If test do recently , may need repeat . This study doctor . The following test may perform : - Your medical history record . - You magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan compute tomography ( CT ) scan . These scan show picture break back bone ( ) tumor . Your doctor use picture plan surgery . Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test . Doctors currently fully understand whether kyphoplasty vertebroplasty well treat broken bone back . For reason , study involve randomly assign participant receive one procedure , participant must eligible procedure order take part study . Treatment Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign treatment group . In phase study , equal chance assign treatment group . If one first 20 patient enrol study , enrol Phase 1 . You randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . Phase 1 Group 1 receive vertebroplasty , Phase 1 Group 2 receive kyphoplasty . If one next 60 patient enrol , enrol Phase 2 . You randomly assign ( toss dice ) 1 4 group . Phase 2 Group 1 receive vertebroplasty , Phase 2 Group 2 receive vertebroplasty Cavity SpineWand . Phase 2 Group 3 receive kyphoplasty , Phase 2 Group 4 receive kyphoplasty Cavity SpineWand . Study Tests/Procedures Before Surgery : Within 2-4 week surgery , test procedure perform . If test do recently , may need repeat . The following procedure may perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - You complete questionnaire ask back pain drug take . In total , questionnaire take 10-20 minute complete . - You ask walk 50 foot pace time see long take . This routine test compare walk function surgery . You sign separate consent form surgery drug use surgery . These drug include antibiotic help low risk infection , drug control pain , local anesthesia make area back surgery feel numb , sedative make feel relaxed sleepy . The risk drug explain detail time . Blood Test Day Surgery : On day surgery , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn . This blood compare blood drawn surgery , see surgery tumor cell find blood . Other Procedures Before Surgery : As standard type surgery , special `` bone '' needle place broken bone ( ) back . X-rays use guide needle safe position . A biopsy tumor back bone collect check diagnosis cancer . To collect biopsy , small amount tumor tissue withdrawn bone needle . Surgical Procedures : If Phase 2 Group 2 Phase 2 Group 4 , Cavity SpineWand use remove small amount tissue immediately kyphoplasty vertebroplasty procedure . If Phase 1 Group 2 , Phase 2 Group 3 , Phase 2 Group 4 , kyphoplasty procedure do next . A small balloon place area back tumor locate . Fluid pump tube order fill balloon , create hole back bone . After balloon deflate ( close ) remove , hole fill cement . X-rays use help place cement safely . If Phase 1 Group 1 , Phase 2 Group 1 , Phase 2 Group 2 , vertebroplasty procedure do next ( instead kyphoplasty ) . Cement inject back bone . X-rays use help place cement safely . No matter treatment group , 1 break back bone need treatment , procedure describe repeated second broken bone , right first procedure . In word , vertebroplasty perform without Cavity Spine Wand , procedure would perform second bone . The procedure would repeat 1 additional time , third time . No matter treatment receive , entire procedure take 2-3 hour . If need procedure repeat second broken bone , additional procedure add 45 minute 2-3 hour first procedure alone would take . Blood Testing Phase 1 Participants : Phase 1 participant blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) draw 8 different time point order measure number tumor cell . This blood drawn 10 , 30 , 60 minute , 2 hour , 6-8 hour , 10-18 hour , 20-28 hour , 7 day surgery . Blood Testing Phase 2 Participants : Phase 2 participant blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) draw 4 different time point surgery . The first second blood draw occur 36 hour pass . The third blood draw 36 hour surgery , fourth blood draw 7 day surgery . This blood test measure number tumor cell . Follow-Up Care : You ask return follow-up visit 7 day surgery 4 week surgery . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You complete questionnaire ask back pain drug take . - You ask walk 50-foot distance , walk time . - At Day 7 visit , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn measure number tumor cell . - At Week 4 visit , ask complete questionnaire ask rate satisfy feel surgery . It take 10 minute complete . At 3 month surgery , study staff call home ask back pain drug may take . Length Study Participation : After Month 3 follow-up phone call , active participation study . If determine surgery tumor back cancerous , would still return follow-up visit standard , would need Day 7 blood test measure number tumor cell . This investigational study . The vertebroplasty kyphoplasty procedure commercially available FDA approve way use study . The Cavity SpineWand also commercially available FDA approve way use study . The research-specific part study blood test measure increase number cancer cell blood . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
