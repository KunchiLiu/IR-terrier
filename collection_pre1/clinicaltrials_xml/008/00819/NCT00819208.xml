	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Participating physical activity program design increase free time physical activity receive write health education material may influence chance cancer recur well impact physical fitness , psychological well-being quality life patient undergone surgery chemotherapy colon cancer . It yet know whether give physical activity program together health education material effective give health education material alone patient undergone colon cancer treatment . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study physical activity program give together health education material see well work compare give health education material alone patient undergone treatment high-risk stage II stage III colon cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Health Education Materials With Without Physical Activity Program Patients Who Have Undergone Treatment High-Risk Stage II Stage III Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare disease-free survival ( DFS ) medically fit patient complete surgical resection adjuvant chemotherapy high-risk stage II stage III colon cancer administer physical activity program general health education material vs general health education material alone . Secondary - To compare two intervention arm respect overall survival ( OS ) ; patient-reported outcome use SF-36 , FACIT-F , PSQI , HADS questionnaires ; objective marker physical fitness use body mass index , hip waist circumference , submaximal exercise testing , Seniors ' Fitness Test ; physical activity behavior use Total Physical Activity Questionnaire ( TPAQ ) ; safety profile assess NCI CTCAE version 3.0 ; serum level insulin ( i.e. , IGF-1 , IGF-2 , IGFBP3 ) ; cytokine level ( i.e. , IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 , TNF-α , IFN-γ , GM-CSF ) C-reactive protein level ; economic evaluation include cost-effective cost-utility analysis ; predictor physical activity adherence use Social-Cognitive Determinants Exercise Measure questionnaire . - To evaluate potential prognostic association serum level insulin , IGF-1 , IGF-2 , IGFBP3 , blood glucose , cytokine ( i.e. , IL- 1β , IL-6 , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 , TNF-α , IFN-γ , GM-CSF ) , C-reactive protein DFS , OS , level physical activity , level fatigue patient . - To evaluate potential prognostic association age , gender , country , incremental increase physical activity , change cardiovascular fitness DFS , OS , level fatigue , quality life patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease stage ( II v III ) , participate center , body mass index ( ≤ 27.5 v &gt; 27.5 ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment intervention . - Arm I : Patients receive general health education material regard nutrition physical activity undergo Colon Health And Life Long Exercise Change ( CHALLENGE ) physical activity program consist behavior-support session supervise physical activity session physical activity consultant . - Part I ( intensive intervention 6 month ) : Patients undergo 12 mandatory biweekly face-to-face behavior support session combine 12 mandatory supervise physical activity session increase physical activity goal 10 metabolic equivalent task ( MET ) hours/week . Twelve supervise physical activity session also recommend alternate week . - Part II ( reduce intervention month 6-12 ) : Patients undergo 12 mandatory biweekly face-to-face telephone behavior support session combine 12 recommend supervised physical activity session increase physical activity goal 20 MET hours/week . - Part III ( minimal intervention month 12-36 ) : Patients undergo mandatory monthly face-to-face telephone behavior support session combine recommend supervised physical activity session increase physical activity goal maximum total 27 MET hours/week . - Arm II : Patients receive general health education material regard nutrition physical activity . Patients complete Total Physical Activity Questionnaire ( TPAQ ) ass exercise participation undergo fitness test periodically submaximal exercise test Seniors ' Fitness Test ( SFT ) . Patients complete SF-36 , FACT-F , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) , Social Cognitive Determinants Exercise Measure questionnaires periodically . Patients also complete 30-day resource use diary undergo health economics analysis Work Productivity Activity Impairment ( WPAI ) questionnaire . Blood sample collect periodically correlative study fast glucose . Samples analyze marker insulin level , IGF-1 , IGF-2 , IGFBP3 , cytokine level ( i.e. , IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 , TNF-α , IFN-γ , GM-CSF ) , C-reactive protein level . During 3 year intervention period , patient follow every 6 month 3 year annually 4-10 year .</detailed_description>
