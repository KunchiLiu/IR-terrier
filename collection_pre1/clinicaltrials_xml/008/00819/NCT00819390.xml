	<detailed_description>HIV characterize persistent immune system activation , early course infection body establish immune activation `` set point '' relate amount HIV blood stream . This set point affect rate CD4 cell loss . Without CD4 cell , low level CD4 cell , body fight illness . This known immunodeficiency . If leave untreated HIV lead extreme immunodeficiency AIDS . Immune system activation include activate CD8 cell . These cell attack body cell infected virus . Because , CD4 cell infect HIV frequently destroy CD8 cell . The purpose study learn well chloroquine reduces level activation CD8 cell people infect HIV . Increased activation CD8 cell think lead severe path disease HIV infection . The constant immune activation observe HIV- infected patient also link high level byproduct certain naturally occur bacteria find gut know immune stimulant . By decrease stimulation byproduct chloroquine treatment , HIV disease may slow . The purpose study learn well chloroquine reduces level activation CD8 cell lower level bacteria byproduct people infected HIV , either antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) ( protocol version 1.0 dated December 17 , 2008 ) on-ART ( protocol version 2.0 date October 1 , 2010 ) . The off-ART ( Arms A B ) on-ART ( Arms C D ) participant enrol different time period , study design analyze two study population separately . This study also look well chloroquine tolerate safety HIV- infect participant . Off-ART participant study randomize equal probability one two treatment arm : Arm A : Participants receive 12 week chloroquine treatment follow 12 week placebo Arm B : Participants receive 12 week placebo follow 12 week chloroquine On-ART participant study randomize equal probability one two treatment arm : Arm C : Participants receive 12 week chloroquine treatment follow 12 week placebo Arm D : Participants receive 12 week placebo follow 12 week chloroquine Study treatment give day full 24 week . There additional 4 week follow-up purpose safety . After treatment start , participant ask come clinic Weeks 4 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 22 , 24 . At visit participant give enough study treatment last next visit . Each visit last 30 60 minute . At visit , participant physical exam , answered question medication take feeling , blood drawn safety ass CD4/CD8 cell count viral load . Some additional blood also store immunology testing . At visit , participant ask question medication medical history , pupil dilate , hear test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Some visit require participant arrive fasting . Pregnancy test also conduct participant able become pregnant pregnancy suspect .</detailed_description>
