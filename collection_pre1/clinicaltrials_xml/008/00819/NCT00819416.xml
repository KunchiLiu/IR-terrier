	<brief_summary>Severe infection intensive care unit common accounting 10 % admission death rate approximately 40-50 % . It almost always associate significant reduction blood pressure . Administration fluid often large volume essential normalize blood pressure prevent failure organs death . Two common class fluid solution crystalloid fluid ( salt base , normal saline ) colloid fluid ( protein base , albumin ) . Due property , albumin fluid may remain vascular space well normal saline solution . Hence , may faster attainment normal blood pressure well reduction fail organ death . Preliminary clinical trial data suggest potential benefit albumin set finding require confirmation large clinical trial . There data explain albumin may exert protective effect lead good outcomes patient severe infection . We conduct clinical study examine potential biological mechanism albumin 's protective effect 50 patient across 6 Canadian academic hospital . We also examine ability successfully recruit patient trial . This study provide information help understand biological mechanism albumin severe infection . The information gain guide investigative team future fluid relate mechanistic question . The study also provide essential information aid design conduct future large clinical trial examine death primary outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluid Resuscitation Early Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Severe sepsis septic shock common cause mortality among critically ill patient account approximately 10 % admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) 3 % admission hospital . Despite decade therapeutic investigation , mortality septic shock remain approximately 40-50 % . Fluid resuscitation integral component early treatment , several liter fluid may administer first hour septic shock attempt re-establish hemodynamic stability . The two main class fluid expand plasma volume include crystalloids colloid . In Canada , main crystalloid fluid use resuscitation normal saline ringer lactate ; main colloid fluid use resuscitation hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) albumin . Until recently , randomize control ( RCT ) systematic review confirm benefit harm either colloidal crystalloid fluid patient population . An RCT publish 2008 demonstrate 10 % pentastarch ( HES fluid ) cause acute renal failure define requirement renal replacement therapy . In contrast , subgroup analysis RCT severe sepsis suggest 4 % albumin fluid may reduce death . However , hypothesis-generating finding require confirmation context large RCT . There limited observational mechanistic study design understand potential biological mechanism albumin 's potential protective effect sepsis . Moreover , mechanistic data clinical trial set lacking . The PRECISE pilot RCT ( Five Percent Albumin versus Normal Saline Fluid Resuscitation Strategies Management Early Suspected Septic Shock ) help understand biological mechanism albumin early septic shock explore feasibility issue preparation large RCT . Study Hypotheses : We hypothesize resuscitation 5 % albumin compare normal saline early septic shock may exert protective effect follow biological mechanism : 1 ) Limiting thrombin generation , 2 ) Supporting endogenous protein C activate protein C ( APC ) generation , 3 ) Limiting production systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine chemokines support production cytokine chemokines anti-inflammatory potential , 4 ) Reducing ability septic plasma generate Neutrophil Extracellular Traps ( NETs ) . Study Design/Setting : A multi-centre randomized control trial conduct 6 Canadian academic centre . Participants : The study enroll 50 adult patient identify early suspect septic shock emergency department ( ED ) intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Patients need hypotensive require vasopressor agent , least 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criterion , form shock ( e.g. , cardiogenic , obstructive , hemorrhagic shock ) previous ICU admission severe sepsis septic shock receive least 1 litre crystalloid 250 ml colloid fluid within 8 hour first hypotensive event . Interventions : Participants randomly assign 1 2 arm . Patients , family , clinician , research personnel blind fluid administer ( 5 % albumin 0.9 % normal saline ) . Fluid resuscitation begin immediately randomization continue first 7 day discharge ICU ED occur sooner . Blood urine collect randomization 6 , 12 , 24 , 72 hr 7 day later . Study fluid administer rapidly possible 500 ml fluid challenge . All co-interventions care protocolized mandate study period . Main Outcome Measures : The primary outcome comparison thrombin generation 72 hour , protein C APC level 7 day . Secondary outcome include comparison inflammatory cytokine chemokine level blood urine . Other clinical outcome include mortality ICU , hospital , 30 day , length stay ICU hospital , development organ failure , need organ support ( defined number day require mechanical ventilation renal replacement therapy ) feasibility measure term patient recruitment . Trial Team : The trial lead 3 primary investigator ( Lauralyn McIntyre , Alison Fox-Robichaud , Alan Tinmouth ) , responsibility aspect trial . They expertise hematology , transfusion medicine , basic science clinical trial critical care . Our team include co-investigators ICU ( Drs . Lauralyn McIntyre , Joe Pagliarello , Anand Kumar , Sean Bagshaw , Alison Fox-Robichaud , Alexis Turgeon ) , ED ( Drs . Ian Stiell , Brian Rowe , Andrew Worster , Marcel Emond ) , ICU/ED ( Drs . Robert Green , David Easton ) act clinical champion participate site . Many co-investigators extensive experience conduct multi-centre RCTs ( Drs . Paul Hebert , Deborah Cook , Dean Fergusson , John Marshall , Ian Stiell , Brian Rowe , Simon Finfer , Alan Tinmouth , Lauralyn McIntyre ) . The translational co-investigative team include critical care physician expertise sepsis pathophysiology ( Drs . Alison Fox Robichaud , Paul Kubes , Patricia Liaw , Anand Kumar , John Marshall , Tao Rui , Claudio Martin ) . Significance finding : Results PRECISE pilot RCT may provide biologic rationale beneficial effect 5 % albumin early septic shock resuscitation . If biologic rationale confirm , study also provide essential information determine feasibility aid design definitive phase III trial albumin resuscitation septic shock .</detailed_description>
