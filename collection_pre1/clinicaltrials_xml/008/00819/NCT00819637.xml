	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine best dose nebulized arformoterol , quick onset long act beta agonist , use treat acute bronchospasm asthmatic present Emergency Department . Also study evaluate side effect safety profile arformoterol use situation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Determine Most Effective Dose Arformoterol Treating Acute Asthmatic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute bronchospasm associate exacerbation asthma common problem . Currently mainstay treatment inhalation albuterol , either levalbuterol racemic mixture , repetitive fashion depend resolution airway obstruction . Formoterol long-acting ( &gt; 12 hour ) selective beta2-agonist rapid onset bronchodilatation ( &lt; 3 minute thus similar produce albuterol ) . Patients acute bronchospasm could benefit prn use formoterol would receive acute relief symptom would last prolonged time period . Additionally formoterol report 28-109 time potent albuterol safe dose 54ug healthy subject asthmatic . Racemic formoterol structurally 2 chiral center thus compose 4 enantiomer . The RR form ( arformoterol ) active bronchodilator clear physiologic action 3 enantiomer . This study first evaluate nebulized arformoterol solution therapy acute asthmatic present Emergency Department .</detailed_description>
