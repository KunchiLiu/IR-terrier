	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) highly prevalent medical condition . Patients PAD usually diagnose basis ankle-brachial index . The ankle-brachial index ratio ankle pressure arm pressure base measurement blood pressure arm legs use Doppler device . The need dedicate equipment train personnel , along time require perform test , identify barrier widespread implementation ankle-brachial index screening . The use automate oscillometric device blood pressure measurement determination ankle-brachial index apply variable success . It beneficial investigate reliable oscillometric-based procedure accurately measure leg pressure ankle-brachial index across entire spectrum PAD severity . The purpose study determine optimal oscillometric-based technique estimation Doppler-derived systolic arm ankle blood pressure calculation ankle-brachial index patient without PAD . Subjects suspect arterial disease non-invasive lab enrol . Arm , ankle , toe pressure measurement make supine position use Doppler , oscillometric method , photoplethysmographic sensor . Arm ankle pressure subset subject obtain seated supine position . The ankle-brachial index toe-brachial index calculate .</brief_summary>
