	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate pattern organic volatile compound ( VOCs ) exhale breath detect biosensors adult persistent mild asthma . The analysis VOCs detect biosensors asthmatic adult compare control group healthy subject exhale nitric oxide ( NO ) . Identification breath VOC pattern may completely noninvasive new technique assess airway inflammation . A device contain series nanosensors use breath analysis VOC pattern integration suitable algorithm pattern recognition . Preliminary data indicate exhale breath pattern detect biosensors healthy subject different patient asthma . In patient asthma , analysis exhale breath use biosensors compare exhale NO measurement study possible correlation independent method assess airway inflammation spirometry assess possible correlation lung function . Measurement exhale NO well-established , validated , standardized method assess monitor airway inflammation patient asthma steroid-naive . In patient asthma , exhale NO concentration correlate blood eosinophil cell count airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) . This study could contribute identification development completely new non-invasive technique assess airway inflammation important implication diagnosis therapeutic monitoring patient asthma . Establishing effect anti-inflammatory drug breath analysis biosensors patient asthma relevant future study aim use technique asthma management .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient male female , least 15 year age 70 year . Patient mild persistent asthma ( step 2 ) Guidelines Diagnosis Management Asthma issue National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute National Institutes Health define history symptom least week less daily ( step 2 ) ( 5 ) . Current asthma treatment include shortacting inhaled βagonist alone need . Patient fulfil follow sign symptom asthma : History symptom include , limited dyspnea , wheeze , chest tightness , cough , sputum production least 12 month . A forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) least 80 % predict value ( prebronchodilator ) withhold βagonist least six hour . Patient diagnosis asthma define 1 ) increase FEV1 PEF ≥12 % ( absolute value ) , 20 30 minute inhaled βagonist administration , OR 2 ) positive methacholine PC20 ( provocative concentration cause 20 % fall FEV1 ) 8 mg/ml low perform within previous 12 month , OR 3 ) fall FEV1 least 15 % exercise challenge perform within previous 12 month . βagonist reversibility methacholine exercise challenge test may satisfy within previous 12 month adequate source documentation .
