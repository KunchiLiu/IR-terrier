	<detailed_description>It know 20-60 % rectal cancer patient treat radical resection local recurrence . Therefore , chemo-radiotherapy operation standard treatment protocol rectal cancer patient reduce local recurrence , preserve surround pelvic viscera , improve prognosis eventually quality life . The preoperative chemo-radiotherapy introduced German Rectal Cancer study , compare pre- postoperative chemo radiotherapy . In study , author report preoperative chemo-radiotherapy reduce local recurrent rate 3 4 degree toxicity improve compliance treatment . Since introduction chemo radiotherapy treatment rectal cancer , numerous controversy guideline protocol chemo-radiotherapy . In 1990 , National Institute Health ( NIH ) recommend postoperative chemo- radiotherapy pT3 pN1 rectal cancer patient consensus conference . In study , report good clinical outcome low local recurrence rate obtain surgical treatment pT3N0 rectal cancer patient favourable pathological characteristic . They also insist effectiveness postoperative chemo- radiotherapy evident . Gunderson , et al . retrospectively evaluated five-year survival rate pT3N0 patient . They report patient surgery chemotherapy show similar survival rate patient underwent surgery postoperative chemo-radiotherapy . National Cancer Data Base show similar report . However , problem apply thesis result decision preoperative therapeutic option . Moreover , paper show low local recurrent rate ( le 5 % ) stage II without supplement therapy , TME precisely perform . All result present controversy radio-chemotherapy T3N0 patient term clinical outcome prognosis . In Korea , numerous clinical trial perform rectal cancer patient , however clinical study preoperative chemo- radiotherapy T3N0 rectal cancer patient . In reason , protocol different among institution without unified standard treatment protocol . In study , author compare accuracy diagnosis , functional difference accord preoperative chemo- radiotherapy , local recurrent rate survival rate two group T3N0 patient ; one group preoperative chemo-radiotherapy vs. without . In addition , author evaluate advantage laparoscopic surgery , extensive vision , laparoscopy help rectal surgery well surgical outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically demonstrate cytologically evident rectal cancer ( Glandular carcinoma : locate 412cm anus ) , case without remote metastasis Age : 1870 year old The patient undergo radiation therapy , surgery antitumor agent therapy disease medical history The patient clinical stage T3N0 identify ultrasound MRI Appropriate bone marrow , liver renal function follow ; granulocyte ≥ 1500 , platelet ≥ 80,000 , bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl , Serum Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl , BUN &lt; 30 , The patient understood right withdraw agreement time sign informed consent form without legal representative . Remote metastatic disease When patient concern local recurrence preoperative chemoradiation therapy undergone , patient expect possibility conservation sphincter improve owe preoperative chemoradiotherapy . Pregnancy Radiotherapy , past history operation chemotherapy Familial multiple polyp Uncontrolled psychiatric disorder , chronic alcohol disease drug addiction CNS ( Central Nervous System ) disorder Other malignant disorder After radiotherapy case remote metastasis detect surgery The case splanchnemphraxis risk progression occlusion examination period Those patient agree participate study The patient seem likely stop middle clinical study . The patient undergo regular followup owe follow reason . For instance , patient psychologic , social , family geographic reason patient difficulty observe proper followup clinical examination plan .
