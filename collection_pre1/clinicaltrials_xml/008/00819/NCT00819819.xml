	<detailed_description>From wean age 12 month clinical data , adherence dietary protocol amount intervention baby-food ingest checked every month . Following investigation perform time recruitment , time wean 12 , 18 , 24 , 30,36 , 42 , 48 , 54 60 month take sample blood ( maximum 4 ml ) infant ( ) quick test IgA anti-tTG ab determination ( drop ) ; ( b ) conventional ELISA serum IgA IgG anti-tTG determination ( 0.4 ml ) ; ( c ) serum zonulin determination ( 0.1 ml ) ; ( e ) serum sample T1D-related autoantibody ( 0.25 ml ) ; ( f ) serum sample stock sera bank ( 0.25 ml ) ; ( g ) whole blood sample EDTA validation quick test ( 0.5 ml ) . All serum sample freeze , store -20 Â°C sent ( boxed dry ice ) block centre responsible determination every 2 month . Cases positive quick-test anti-tTG serum sample freeze immediately ship confirmatory determination . If infant develop symptoms intervention period ( 6 12 month ) group infant belongs decode . Infants belong group A ( gluten-containing diet ) presenting symptom suggestive CD undergo complete diagnostic work-up CD . These event report form . After age 1 year , infant develop symptom suggestive active CD ( chronic diarrhea , failure thrive , etc ) in-between schedule visit undergo supplementary serological investigation . A small intestinal biopsy recommend case show either serum anti-tTG ab high cut-off IgG-AGA high cut-off infant selective IgA deficiency . ( Standard medical care part research ) . The evolution composition intestinal microbiota evaluate group 7d , 30d , 4-6 month ( prior weaning ) , 12,18,24,30,36 , 42 , 48 , 54 60 month . The bacterial composition stool also analyze sub-sample child develop active CD non-CD control . All patient develop CD continue study . Definitions : Active CD : Children show positive serology sign immune-mediated damage small intestinal mucosa biopsy ( range isolate increase intraepithelial lymphocytes villous atrophy crypt hypertrophy . ) CD serological autoimmunity positive : Children positive IgA anti-tTG ab two consecutive occasion . Disruption small intestinal barrier : Children increase ratio serum lactulose/mannitol without increased level serum zonulin .</detailed_description>
