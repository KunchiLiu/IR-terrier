Sample selection : This randomize , control prospective study , carry participant diagnose persistent IGT use 1999 World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion . Interested participant fulfil inclusion criterion participate prevention programme . Screening carried work place . The participant advise strenuous work screen period . Interested participant , overnight fast 8 12 hour , underwent capillary blood glucose test 2h PG ingestion 75G glucose . Among subject identify IGT , 2h PG value &gt; 8.9 mmol/l ( ≥ 160 mg/dl ) invite confirmatory OGTT , within week . During 2nd GTT , venous blood sample collect fasting ( 0 minute ) , 30 120 minute glucose intake.Subjects satisfy criterion IGT occasion recruit prevention programme . Randomized base MATLAB 'randperm ' random number generator ( MARSAGLIA RANDOM NUMBER generator algorithm ) . Recruitment : Subjects recruit two group : 1. control arm : advised LSM beneficial effect healthy dietary habit , weight reduction increase physical activity baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month respectively ( standard care advise ) . 2 . Intervention group : receive addition advise would receive frequent text message general well different form physical activity principle healthy diet . The frequency time participant preferred receive message note . Assessments : Both group undergo personal review 6 monthly interval period 2 year . At randomization , participant interview personally elicit demographic , medical , diet , behavioral physical activity detail . 6 &amp; 18 month assessment : Diet physical activity questionnaire , body weight , WC , pulse BP obtain . Two hour post glucose measure . 12 &amp; 24 month assessment : Participants question acceptability project impact life . Changes health document physical examination repeat . They complete dietary , physical activity quality life questionnaire ask use healthcare resource health economic assessment . The OGTT ECG repeat , measurement baseline .</detailed_description>
