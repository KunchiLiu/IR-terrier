	<brief_title>A Trial Licartin Preventing Tumor Recurrence After Liver Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) represent major health care challenge present era , incidence rate 71128 case mortality rate 679871 case 2007 world . Although liver transplantation , resection locally ablative therapy remain useful treatment preference patient early HCC , often avail either disease progression outgrowth treatment criterion , especially liver resection . Moreover , resection , recurrence liver tumor expect many 70 % patient within 5 year lead unsatisfactory long term survival patient HCC , hence prevention effective management recurrence undoubtedly major strategy prolong survival . And although lot different adjuvant therapy try clinic , include TACE , immunotherapy antivirus therapy etc . role prevent recurrence remain controversial . Licartin ( generic name , [ 131I ] metuximab injection ) , member CD147 family therapeutical anti-HCC radioimmunologic agent , generate label 131I murine monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) target fragment HAb18 F ( ab_ ) 2 , approve new drug clinical therapy primary HCC China State Food Drug Administration good concentrate tumor region safe effective treatment HCC . Previous RCT study indicate Licartin prevent post-Orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) tumor recurrence advance HCC patient exceed Milan criterion . The recurrence rate significantly decrease 30.4 % 1-year follow OLT group compare control group show Licartin may promise drug prevent tumor recurrence liver transplantation . But less information know role adjuvant therapeutic drug liver resection . To determine clinical efficacy Licartin prevent tumor recurrence liver resection , set randomize , control trial patient definitely diagnose HCC successfully treat liver resection . Patients HCC receive curative liver resection ( R0 ) positive expression HAb18G/CD147 HCC tissue randomly assign 1:1 doctor receive placebo ( control group ) Licartin ( treatment group ) . All patient treatment group receive Licartin 3 time interval 28 day begin 4th week liver resection . The outcomes patient evaluate 3-years follow .</detailed_description>
