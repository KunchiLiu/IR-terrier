	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety combination RAD001 PKC412 cancer treatment , establish high dose RAD001 give conjunction PKC412 . These drug use research trial individual solid hematology malignancy . Past research PKC412 show block abnormal function enzyme call FLT3 . FLT3 find cell either normal ( wild type ) genetically change form play role survival growth AML cell . RAD001 inhibitor central growth pathway involve protein MTOR . The MTOR pathway overactive cancer cell , cause cell grow abnormally . By inhibit abnormal growth activity MTOR pathway , RAD001 slow possibly stops growth cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAD001 Combination With PKC412 Patients With Relapsed , Refractory Poor Prognosis AML MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This dose-escalation study 3 participant give particular start dose RAD001 certain schedule . If dose schedule well tolerate , next 3 participant enrol assigned new dose schedule and/or high dose RAD001 . This continue maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach RAD001 . - Each cycle treatment consist 28 day outpatient basis . Participants receive RAD001 assign schedule dosage day 1 day 8 28 first cycle . For subsequent cycle RAD001 take daily . Additionally , participant take PKC412 twice day day 2 28 first cycle . For subsequent cycle PKC412 take twice daily . - During course trial follow evaluation procedure complete various time : review medical history ; review concomitant medication ; physical exam ; performance status ; vital sign ; EKG ; chest x-ray ; blood test bone marrow aspirate/biopsy .</detailed_description>
