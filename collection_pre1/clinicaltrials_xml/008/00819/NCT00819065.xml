	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Two Commercial Formulations Botulinum Toxin Type A Treatment Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Botulinum toxin type A use clinically spasticity treatment decade . There , nowadays , three commercial formulation BTA , wich , though type toxin , different biological product differ storage , dilution dosage . The unit one toxin exclusive product , international standard-unit lack . Each kind BTA validation safety study , comparative study . Thus , purpose study compare efficacy two commercial formulation BTA treatment spasticity . We also evaluate safety , adverse effect cost formulation . Will include study patient currently treatment BTA/with indication BTA treatment spasticity , must contraindication drug , Spasticity outpatient clinic Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre . All patient include must agree participate study sign informed consent form.Patients randomize two group 28 individual ( total 56 patient ) receive BTA laboratory Allergan Lanzhou , one time allocation three month , crossover model . These drug approve ANVISA treatment spasticity provide national public health system ( SUS ) . Application perform trained investigator , unaware kind BTA use . Standard dilution toxin employ , within usual dose application spot ( patient already treatment ) standard ( patient yet start treatment ) . Identical dose use , 2ml saline solution 0,9 % dilution 100units , thus , difference patient investigator concern applicated volume , assure appropriate masking . Follow-up visit perform four , twelve , sixteen twenty-four week , investigator unaware kind BTA use . The modified Ashworth Scale apply every visit three medical investigator isolatedly , duly train blind intervention . Life quality assess time allocation , four twelve week , use WHOQOL-Bref , YQOL-R Children 's Life Quality Assessment Questionnaire , respect age patient . Functional capability also evaluate , Functional Independence Measure Scale ( FIM ) adult PEDI scale child , time frame life quality assessment instrument . The primary end-point consist maximum degree effect assess passive measurement muscular tonus quantify modified Ashworth Scale . Secondary end-points presence , kind duration adverse effect treatment perception improvement symptom patient caregiver . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS package Windows descriptive analysis provide absolute relative frequency average±standard deviation quantitative variable percentage qualitative one . The T Student Mann-Whitney test use independent sample , chi-square Fischer 's exact test perform necessary . Significance level 5 % .There additional risk patient , since drug involve trial already test individually efficacy safety currently use medical practice treatment condition . The Public Health State Secretariat responsible provide drug , accord routine pharmaceutical assistance , additional cost hospital health system .</detailed_description>
