	<brief_summary>Subjects receive immunization every week 8 immunization prior clinical immunological evaluation . Patients receive immunization every month one year . Cyclophosphamide administer intravenously 3 day prior first immunization , 3rd , 5th , 7th , 9th , subsequent monthly immunization . Women men &gt; = 18 year age refractory metastatic malignancy express NY-ESO-1 RT-PCR immunohistochemistry . Alternatively , patient may elect basis serum anti-NY-ESO- ! -antibodies detect ELISA . Primary Objective : To evaluate toxicity profile regimens described Section 1.6 . Secondary Objective : To detect quantitate immune response induce propose peptide vaccine protein vaccine association CpG 7909 cyclophosphamide . This endpoint assess IFN-y ELISPOT assay NY-ESO-1-specific tumor-reactive CD8 + T cell . We also look NY-ESO-1 tetramer CD8+ T cell , Delayed-type Hypersensitivity ( DTH ) , NY-ESO-1-specific CD4+ T cell response ELISPOT assay cytokine-release-assays . Tertiary Objectives : To evaluate tumor response term clinical tumor regression progression-free interval . To evaluate survival patient treat regimen describe Section 1.6 . The first 3 patient assign treatment A . All three patient treat observed one month . If DLTs observe first 3 patient , accrual arm A put hold accrual continue Arm B . However , 1 DLT observe Arm A , 3 additional patient treat Arm A , either 2 DLTs observe , 6 patient treat 1 DLT among . If 2 DLTs observe Arm A , study terminate treatment deem intolerable . The principle apply cohort treat B-E : number DLTs ( one month treatment ) zero , accrual proceeds next treatment group ; 1 , accrual continue treatment 3 additional patient ; 2 , patient treat remain treatment arm .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent obtain prior initiation study procedure . 2 . Male female subject &gt; = 18 year age . 3 . Measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . 4 . Tumor must express NYESO1 determine RTPCR immunohistochemistry . Subjects antiNYESO1 antibody measure ELISA , also eligible trial . 5 . No specific HLA expression require systematically perform patient genotypic HLA typing . 6 . Negative serology test HIV 1 2 , Hepatitis B C. 7 . Adequate hematologic , renal , liver function evidence follow : WBC &gt; = 3,000 / mm3 ; lymphocytes &gt; = 1,000 / mm3 ; platelet &gt; = 100,000 / mm3 ; serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Serum Bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 x ULN ; Serum AST / ALT &lt; = 2.5 x ULN . 8 . Subjects stage III/IV cancer eligible progress receive available wellestablished lifeprolonging therapy . 9 . Subjects melanoma must histologically confirm measurable Stage III Stage IV melanoma ( accord current AJCC 6th edition classification ) . Cutaneous , ocular mucosal melanoma eligible . 10 . Subjects Stage III Stage IV prostate cancer receive responded radiation therapy , surgery ( applicable ) hormonal therapy , hormonerefractory . Subjects must two consecutive PSA value , least 14 day apart , &gt; = 5 ng/ml &gt; = 50 % minimum PSA observe castration therapy pretreatment value response . 11 . Subjects Stage III Stage IV breast cancer receive responded radiation therapy ( applicable ) , hormonal therapy ( ER+ ) two regimen standard chemotherapy . 12 . Subjects Stage III Stage IV NSCLC lung cancer receive responded radiotherapy ( applicable ) , surgery ( applicable ) , least one regimen standard chemotherapy . 13 . Subjects locally advance metastatic bladder cancer receive responded radical cystectomy ( applicable ) , radiation therapy ( applicable ) , least one combination chemotherapy regimen . 14 . Subjects Stage III Stage IV head neck cancer receive responded radiotherapy , surgery , least one regimen chemotherapy combination . 15 . Subjects Stage III Stage IV soft tissue sarcoma receive responded radiotherapy , surgery , least one regimen chemotherapy combination . 16 . Subjects Stage III Stage IV ovarian cancer receive progressed surgery least one regimen standard chemotherapy combination . 17 . Subject Stage III multiple myeloma receive least two regimen relapse / refractory multiple myeloma include bortezomib velcade . 18 . Subjects must fully recover surgery , must receive chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiotherapy , biological therapy within precede 4 week . 19 . Life expectancy least 6 month . 20. WHO Performance Status 0 1 . 21 . Normal titer ANA ( &lt; = 1/80 ) antids DNA ( &lt; = 1/10 ) . Patients elevate titer ANAs ( &gt; 1/80 ) antids DNA ( &gt; 1/10 ) exclude protocol symptom active autoimmune disease assess specialized consultation ( rheumatologist ) . 22 . Subjects need recover effect previous treatment ( recovery must document least 1 week prior treatment study ) . 23 . Subjects must free brain metastasis contrastenhanced CT/MRI scan brain metastasis : total number brain metastasis &lt; =3 ; brain metastasis must either completely remove surgery treat stereotactic radiosurgery ( gamma knife ) ; subject must asymptomatic 1 month . 24 . Female subject child bear potential must negative pregnancy test , must breast feeding . 25 . Subjects must agree use effective contraception ( male female ) . We decide include patient NYESO1expressing tumor different histological type melanoma previously do ongoing trial UPCI 00079 . The reason severalfold . First , expect type disease impact main objective ( i.e . safety , toxicity immunological ) . Second , feel important able include eligible cancer patient available therapeutic option willing include novel investigative trial . Finally , experience ongoing trial UPCI 00079 lead u think large majority patient melanoma patient ( 17 patient included date , include 16 melanoma patient one sarcoma patient ) . 1 . Subjects prostate cancer demonstrate antiandrogen withdrawal response , define &gt; = 25 % drop PSA within 4 week ( flutamide ) six week ( nilutamide , bicalutamide ) stop nonsteroidal antiandrogen eligible PSA rise nadir observe antiandrogen withdrawal . 2 . Serious illness , : cardiovascular disease ( uncontrolled congestive heart failure , hypertension , cardiac ischemia , myocardial infarction , severe cardia arrhythmia ) , bleed disorder , autoimmune disease , severe obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease , active systemic infection , inflammatory bowel disorder , severe renal disease . 3 . Any significant psychiatric disease , medical intervention , condition , opinion principal investigator , could prevent adequate informed consent compromise participation clinical trial . 4 . Active infection antibiotic within oneweek prior study , include unexplained fever ( temp &gt; 38.1 degree C ) . 5 . Treatment nitrosources within 6 week prior enrollment . 6 . Systemic steroid immunosuppressive therapy &gt; 10 day within 4 week enrollment . 7 . A requirement systemic immunosuppressive therapy &gt; 5 day develop trial result subject remove study . 8 . Treatment investigational immunization CpG 7909 NYESO1 peptide NYESO1 protein within two year registration treatment investigational product within 28 day registration .</criteria>
