	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate preliminary safety accuracy ActiSightâ„¢ Needle Guidance System patient undergo CT-guided lung aspiration biopsy . This image guidance system use combination CT scan camera image help guide biopsy needle lung lesion . The system display simulate image biopsy needle estimate path biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Accuracy Study ActiSight Needle Guidance System Patients Undergoing CT-Guided Percutaneous Chest Aspiration Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Why study conduct demonstrate safety effectiveness ActiSight Needle Guidance System assist trained physician perform CT guide percutaneous needle biopsy ( PNB ) fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) procedures chest . Subjects , schedule medically indicate chest PNB FNA procedures meet inclusion exclusion criterion , ask participate study . The aim enroll 40 subject complete whole study . Recruited subject go screen test eligible , undergo , within 18 day screen , CT Guided chest PNB FNA utilize ActiSight Needle Guidance system . Subjects observed test least hour procedure detect serious complication . A follow-up conduct within 7-10 day procedure day safety evaluation . Safety accuracy data stage study collect analyzed . The effectiveness guidance system measure primarily frequency reach intend target , determine final CT scan . Other measure include number needle puncture number intermediate CT scan need complete procedure . The safety system measure frequency severity adverse event . Procedure description : First , single-use , disposable pad ( ActiSticker ) attach patient 's skin point needle insertion select interventionist . The pad incorporate reference object easily detectable CT image visually . A volume CT scan , cover least pad , target lesion adjacent structure perform . Next , CT image volume scan transfer ActiSight computer operator mark target procedure , well reference point ActiSticker . Next , optical sensor , also single-use disposable , attached top needle . By optically detect reference point relate know position CT image , system calculate position top tip needle relation target lesion . During procedure , system show user , graphic computer display , whether needle aim directly target far tip needle intend target help user aim insertion guidance needle target .</detailed_description>
