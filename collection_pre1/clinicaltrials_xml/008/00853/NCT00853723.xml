	<brief_summary>This three month comparison trial standard dose parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) ( 1-34 ) two different dos Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein ( PTHrP ) ( 1-36 ) . The investigator want demonstrate daily subcutaneous injection PTHrP ( 1-36 ) postmenopausal woman osteoporosis stimulate bone formation great degree PTH ( 1-34 ) less bone resorption .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis metabolic bone disease characterize low bone mass structural deterioration bone tissue . It result failure osteoblasts form sufficient new bone , excessive rate osteoclastic bone resorption , combination process . The resultant bone fragility lead increase susceptibility fracture , especially hip , spine wrist . There increased mortality rate follow hip vertebral fracture , presence one fracture potent risk factor future fracture . This lead decline quality life associate loss independence among million individual United States worldwide afflict disease . There additional population increase risk fracture due less severe loss bone mass , know osteopenia ( 1 ) . Already ten million individual United States estimate disease thirty four million increase risk due low bone mass ( 1 ) . Approved pharmacological treatment postmenopausal osteoporosis include two class drug : antiresorptive anabolics ( 2 ) . The antiresorptive include estrogen , calcitonin , selective estrogen receptor modulators , bisphosphonates . The antiresorptive medication prevent bone loss inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption formation , slow bone turnover , allow increase mineralization osteoid ( 2 ) . The increase bone mineral density antiresorptive agent generally report range 2-8 % 1-7 year ( 3-7 ) . There one anabolic agent presently approve FDA treatment osteoporosis : parathyroid hormone , PTH ( 1-34 ) , teriparatide . PTH ( 1-34 ) approve FDA 2002 act increase bone density stimulate PTH-1 receptor . This induce increase osteoblast mediate bone formation osteoclast mediate bone resorption . Daily subcutaneous PTH anabolic stimulation bone formation great extent bone resorption . The overall net result biosynthetic PTH ( 1-34 ) increase bone mineral density decrease fracture ( 8 ) . Daily PTH ( 1-34 ) treatment show effectively reduce risk vertebral nonvertebral fracture . Measurements bone mineral density ( BMD ) lumbar spine ( LS ) result increase bone density 9 percent compare placebo ( 9 ) . A daily 20 microgram dose subcutaneous PTH ( 1-34 ) reduce risk get two vertebral fracture 77 % , risk least one moderate severe fracture reduce 90 78 % respectively ( 9 ) . Additionally , one vertebral fracture prevent every 12 patient year treatment , woman 35 % le likely one new nonvertebral fragility fracture ( 9 ) . Parathyroid hormone-related protein PTHrP protein peptide first isolated 1987 factor responsible syndrome humoral hypercalcemia malignancy ( HHM ) ( 10-14 ) . PTHrP find almost every tissue cell type body , appear regulate cellular proliferation , survival , differentiation normal tissue well malignancy ( 15-16 ) . As name implies , PTHrP similar PTH . Both peptide bind receptor , PTH-1 R , activate downstream signal pathway cause similar post receptor effect ( 17 ) . Since PTH potent anabolic agent , hypothesize PTHrP may act anabolic fashion well . We seek demonstrate study PTHrP act anabolic agent treatment osteoporosis similar well efficacy PTH respect bone formation le bone resorption few side effect , hypercalcemia . The current study sequel initial phase 1 trial assess efficacy safety daily subcutaneous injection PTHrP human skeleton . Previous study demonstrate single daily injection ~ 400 mcg/day PTHrP ( 1-36 ) postmenopausal woman estrogen osteoporosis lead 4.7 % increase lumbar spine bone mineral density ( BMD ) three month subject free hypercalcemia adverse effect ( 18 ) . In contrast PTH , dose PTHrP much large , yet well-tolerated , increment spine BMD large rapid subject show increase spine BMD 6-8 % soon three month study do thus far ( 18 ) . PTHrP appear selectively stimulate bone formation without stimulate bone resorption ( 18 ) . This exciting observation may point towards PTHrP pure skeletal anabolic agent ( 21 ) . Preliminary data analysis recent three week dose escalation trial indicate demonstrate dose 500 mcg/day PTHrP cause 38 % increase P1NP 20 % decrease CTX indicating far great bone formation bone resorption hypercalcemia . At 625 mcg/day similar increase P1NP hypercalcemia 10 % subject hypercalcuria 20 % . In contrast subject receive 750 mcg/day 50 % develop hypercalcemia require early termination . The P1NP CTX data three week dose escalation trial use determine dose sample size calculation study .</detailed_description>
