	<brief_title>Discharge ALERT : Quality Improvement Initiative</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) often avoidable hospitalized patient proven prevention strategy establish patient risk ( 1 ) . North American European prophylaxis guideline widely disseminate . However , despite focus strategy prevention VTE hospitalize patient time admission hospital , little focus prevention VTE time discharge hospital ( 2,3 ) . At Brigham Women 's Hospital , undertook previous Quality Improvement Initiative ( BWH protocol # 2000P000328 ) aim increase frequency VTE prophylaxis high risk patient . This novel strategy require : 1 ) devising risk score reliably quickly identify patient high risk VTE , 2 ) randomize high-risk patient without prophylaxis intervention group control group . The intervention group 's physician receive single electronic , computerized alert explain patient high risk , receive prophylaxis , suggest prophylaxis order template available pharmacological mechanical option . In contrast , control group 's physician receive alert ( 4 ) . Each 8 common risk factor weight accord point scale . To label `` high-risk '' VTE , point score must equal exceed 4 point . There 2,506 patient Quality Improvement Initiative : 1,255 intervention group 1,251 control group . The incidence symptomatic VTE 90 day high : 8.2 % control group 4.9 % intervention group ( 4 ) . Currently , investigator initiated Quality Improvement Initiative ( BWH protocol # 2005-P-002527 ) human alert rather electronic , computerized alert , undertaken high risk patient receive prophylaxis . Enrollment 2,500 patient 25 center locate throughout United States complete November 2007 follow-up rate exceed 99 % . Analysis data currently conduct . Limited research focus place high-risk VTE subject community , outside hospital setting . Since VTE prophylaxis focus upon protection high-risk patient time hospital admission , need focus VTE prophylaxis within 48 hour hospital discharge . It clear preparation make hospital discharge , many patient remain high risk DVT acute pulmonary embolism . After discharge , patient even high risk hospitalization prolong immobilization bed rest home ( 5 ) . The Discharge Alert Quality Improvement Initiative determine whether alert physician importance continue VTE prophylaxis prior time plan hospital discharge low incidence outpatient VTE . This new strategy unproven might effective , Quality Improvement Initiative provide definitive answer . We also implement part Discharge Alert Trial in-hospital Quality Improvement Initiative intensive patient education Brigham Women 's Hospital improve patient adherence physician-ordered pharmacological venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) prophylaxis . We hypothesize implementation education program , few patient decline physician-ordered dos enoxaparin unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) compare recent cohort patient risk VTE receive specialize education VTE . METHODOLOGY Identification Patients Risk Venous Thromboembolism ( VTE ) Hospitalized patient await plan discharge within 48 hour evaluate previously validate ( BWH protocol # 2000P000328 ) VTE risk profile . The VTE risk profile compute patient await discharge use 8 common risk factor . Each risk factor weight accord point score . To label `` high risk '' VTE , point score must equal exceed 4 point . Minor ( Low ) Risk Factors ( 1 POINT ) : - Advanced Age ( &gt; 70 year age ) - Obesity ( BMI &gt; 29 , presence word `` obesity '' admission exam note ) - Bed rest / Immobility ( relate surgery ) - Female Hormone Replacement Therapy Oral Contraceptives Intermediate Risk Factor ( 2 POINTS ) : - Major Surgery ( &gt; 60 minute , admission ) Major ( High ) Risk Factors ( 3 POINTS ) : - Cancer ( active ) - Prior VTE - Hypercoagulability Screening Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis If cumulative VTE risk score least 4 , order review detect ongoing mechanical pharmacological prophylactic measure . Mechanical prophylactic measure include graduate compression stocking intermittent pneumatic compression device . Pharmacological prophylactic measure include unfractionated heparin , enoxaparin , dalteparin , fondaparinux , tinzaparin , warfarin . At Brigham Women 's Hospital , also identify new order pharmacological VTE prophylaxis enoxaparin UFH use BWH computerized order entry system part additional component Quality Improvement Initiative . For component Quality Improvement Initiative , eligibility define DVT Risk Score 3 high electronically enter physician 's order appropriate pharmacologic VTE thromboprophylaxis . Quality Improvement Intervention The intervention take place within 48 hour plan hospital discharge . If randomize alert , responsible physician notify : 1 ) patient high risk VTE , 2 ) VTE prophylaxis consider Discharge order . If randomize alert ( control patient ) , responsible physician contact . At Brigham Women 's Hospital , also provide 500 eligible patient prospective cohort one-on-one education use script dialog describe rationale importance pharmacological VTE prophylaxis . Prophylaxis Guidelines Discharge `` Consider Venous Thromboembolism prophylaxis time hospital discharge patient congestive heart failure respiratory disease prolong immobility . '' `` For without contraindication , consider pharmacological prophylaxis low-molecular weight heparin , unfractionated heparin , fondaparinux . '' `` For high risk bleeding , consider mechanical prophylaxis intermittent pneumatic compression device graduate compression stocking . '' Follow Up A 90-day follow-up perform study patient . If patient outcome determine medical record review alone , study representative may contact subject 's Primary Care Physician ( PCP ) necessary information . IRB approval must obtain participate hospital prior contact subject ' PCPs . Data Collection Study Endpoints The primary endpoint clinically diagnose DVT PE 90 day . Safety endpoint include total mortality hemorrhagic event 90 30 day , respectively . These endpoint utilize prior Quality Improvement Initiative ( BWH protocol # 2000P000328 ) . Hemorrhagic event classify accord Global Utilization Streptokinase Tissue Plasminogen Activator Occluded Coronary Arteries ( GUSTO ) trial criterion . Bleeding event classify severe life-threatening intracerebral result substantial hemodynamic compromise require treatment . Moderate bleeding define need transfusion . Minor event refer bleed require transfusion cause hemodynamic compromise . We report rate `` major bleeding '' define GUSTO severe/life-threatening moderate bleeding . For additional component Quality Improvement Initiative Brigham Women 's Hospital , also assess improvement medication adherence enoxaparin UFH follow intensive individualized patient education program compare recently complete cohort study uniform education program target VTE prophylaxis . Statistical Analysis The initial sample size ( power 80 % , two-sided alpha 5 % ) calculate 2,500 patient base estimate 7 % rate primary end point control group , odds ratio 0.59 primary endpoint intervention group patient . This yield sample size requirement 2,138 patient , plus estimate 362 patient withdraw study . We use Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparison distribution continuous variable group , chi-square test Fisher 's exact test comparison categorical variable . The primary analysis difference Kaplan-Meier estimator freedom VTE day 90 intervention control patient . The log-rank test estimate cumulative probability primary endpoint intervention control group . We use proportional-hazards model estimation relative hazard clinical endpoint associate physician alert . All p-values report two-sided .</detailed_description>
