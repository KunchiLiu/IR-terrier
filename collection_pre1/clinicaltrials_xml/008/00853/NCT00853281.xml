	<brief_summary>In Central Vietnam , forest malaria remain difficult control due complex interaction human , vector environmental factor . Untreated bednets significantly protect effect villager , except regularly sleep forest , suffer significantly high number clinical attack . Thus , need target high-risk group new intervention base long-lasting insecticidal material . Hammocks extensively use people work forest , therefore long-lasting insecticidal hammock ( LLIH ) could achieve good individual protection . The Investigators propose evaluate effectiveness community-based trial , compare standard vector control method ( insecticide-treated net ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cluster Randomized Trial Evaluate Long Lasting Insecticidal Hammocks Prevent Forest Malaria Vietnam</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Central Vietnam , forest malaria remain difficult control due complex interaction human , vector environmental factor . A community-based study carry 1999 2001 show regular forest activity strong risk factor malaria infection . Untreated bednets significantly protect effect villager , except regularly sleep forest , suffer significantly high number clinical attack . Thus , need target high-risk group new intervention base long-lasting insecticidal material . Hammocks extensively use people work forest , therefore long-lasting insecticidal hammock ( LLIH ) could achieve good individual protection . The Investigators propose evaluate effectiveness community-based trial , compare standard vector control method ( insecticide-treated net ) : community group cluster 1000 Ã®nhabitants , cluster randomize either active intervention active control , follow 24 month .</detailed_description>
