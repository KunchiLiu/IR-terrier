	<brief_summary>Heart failure ( HF ) major public health problem , affect 5 million Americans.HF heart muscle pump much blood body need . As result , body difficulty keep optimal fluid status . The fluid status body regulate heart kidney . Due strong interaction heart kidney , heart failure result slight decrease kidney function well . It known people primarily suffer chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) high risk develop arterial calcification . Calcification artery cause deposit calcium within wall blood vessel . Calcifications artery may result loss elasticity blood vessel . Recent research study show people CKD stiffer blood vessel people , associate high chance develop cardiovascular disease . However , know whether decrease kidney function people HF result arterial calcification well . In addition , know whether also associate high risk develop cardiovascular disease ( disease heart blood vessel . ) We ask take part study HF combine decrease kidney function . The purpose study see whether people HF decrease kidney function high chance develop arterial calcification . We compare result follow ; 1 ) several blood test , 2 ) picture take heart echocardiogram compute tomography ( CT ) scan , 3 ) measurement elasticity artery . All test routinely use clinical care . However , research study compare result see relate arterial calcification people HF decrease kidney function . We also want see whether people HF decrease kidney function high risk develop cardiovascular disease . This study perform Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , Boston Massachusetts . We expect enroll total 150 subject MGH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcium , Phosphate , Renal Impairment Coronary Artery Disease Cardio-renal Syndrome , The CAPRICORN-CRS Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The interaction cardiac renal ( dy ) function highly relevant , yet poorly understood phenomenon clinician scientist . More 50 % heart failure patient suffers renal impairment , define creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min , renal impairment one powerful predictor outcome heart failure.However , complex mechanism renal insufficiency associate bad outcome , still fully elucidate . It presume set acute heart failure , cardiac output reduces , counteract systemic response decrease renal blood flow , order retain circulate fluid restore cardiac output.Yet , heart failure patient deterioration renal function necessarily poor ventricular function , low cardiac output low blood pressures.It therefore hypothesize renal impairment merely marker end-stage heart failure , associate myriad pathophysiological process may influence prognosis . One consequences renal insufficiency usually remain unnoticed cardiologist , disregulation calcium phosphate homeostasis . Yet , especially hyperphosphatemia present 50 % pre-dialysis patient important independent predictor cardiovascular morbidity mortality population . The pathophysiological mechanism behind process intensively study . In vitro study show elevated phosphate concentration induce differentiation vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) via Cbfa1 osteoblast-like cell . These osteoblast-like cell capable produce bone matrix protein , may subsequently regulate mineralization . Once mineralization initiate , increase Ca x PO4 product ( ab ) normal bone metabolism , secondary hyperparathyroidism , excessive calcium intake may accelerate process lead vascular calcification . Serum phosphate concentration regulate fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF-23 ) , circulate protein may protect transition VSMC osteoblast-like cell lower phosphate concentrations.Studies FGF-23 null mouse reveal extensive vascular calcification medium layer arteries.FGF-3 also strongly related vascular calcification patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , association find atherosclerosis subject normal renal function . Fetuin-A , also circulatory protein , inhibit de novo formation precipitation mineral basic calcium phosphate , dissolve basic calcium phosphate form . Therefore , fetuin-A prevent undesirable calcification circulation without inhibit bone mineralization . Serum level fetuin-A individual dialysis patient indeed inversely correlate coronary artery calcification CT scan . Matrix-carboxyglutamic acid protein ( MGP ) , calcification inhibitor , vitamin-K-dependent protein synthesize chondrocytes VSMC.MGP knockout mouse develop severe calcification arterial medium layer.However , carboxylate MGP seem inhibit process calcification inhibition MGP carboxylation vitamin K antagonist warfarin result extensive calcification artery vitro well vivo.This explain fact warfarin treatment undercarboxylated MGP ( uc-MGP ) synthesize , inactive . It recently find uc-MGP serum concentration negatively associate phosphate level positively fetuin-A intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) concentration , suggest low uc-MGP concentration may marker active calcification.Besides , low uc-MGP concentration inversely relate aortic augmentation index , marker arterial stiffness , well coronary artery calcification diagnose CT. Interestingly , process vascular calcification renal impairment seem process accelerate atherosclerosis , i.e plaque ( de ) formation , severe calcification besides exist atherosclerosis . It show autopsy specimen ESRD patient match control plaque area volume different two group , plaque calcify ESRD population . Furthermore , intimal thickness different two group well , whereas medial thickness significantly great ESRD patient . In addition , 2- 5-fold increase coronary artery calcification find dialysis patient compare age-matched non-dialysis patient angiographically proven coronary artery disease . An elegant , new diagnostic technique seem ideal image coronary calcification , coronary artery calcification score ( CAC-score ) measure electron-beam compute tomography ( EBCT ) .This technique enables objectify coronary artery calcification without application nephrotoxic contrast agent . Although would ideal tool diagnose coronary artery disease patient classical contrast agent could potentially harmful , debate role CAC determination cardiovascular medicine . Indeed , recently AHA/ACC panel expert state role CAC still undetermined . Because variability report data large variance calcium score asymptomatic population , clear definition CAC score threshold application general population problematic . For cutoff threshold 100-200 range Agatston score , population study find although negative predictive value high ( 0.95-0.99 ) , positive predictive value rather low ( 0.02-0.13 ) . Although positive correlation site amount coronary artery calcium percent coronary luminal narrow anatomic site , relation nonlinear large confidence limits.The relation arterial calcification , like angiographic coronary artery stenosis , probability plaque rupture unknown broad variation correlation CAC angiographically proven coronary artery disease patient without renal impairment . Interestingly however , find CAC EBCT correlate well serum concentration calcium phosphate ESRD patient . While uncertainty exact association plaque instability , vascular calcification lead arterial stiffness.Arterial stiffness objectify functional parameter pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) augmentation index ( AIx ) .It previously demonstrate CAC strongly correlate parameter arterial stiffness.Interestingly , find PWV independent predictor future coronary event , patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention increase AIx , high risk future coronary event.Furthermore , population patient renal impairment find PWV significantly correlate vascular calcification CT well serum phosphate concentration . Via increase pressure throughout systole decrease pressure throughout diastole , arterial stiffness result increase cardiomyocyte oxygen demand . While acute increase load increase tension-time index acute oxygen demand , chronic increase enhances basal oxygen requirement . This process increase coronary blood flow requirement , associate decreased ability supply , develop independently coronary narrowing . Although small study indeed suggest heart failure patient higher serum phosphate concentration , prevalence prognostic role hyperphosphatemia disturbance calcium phosphate balance heart failure patient renal impairment never specific subject investigation large population . The correlation coronary artery calcification , arterial stiffness coronary event population unknown well . We design study order investigate prevalence calcium phosphate disturbance correlate marker fetuin-A , uc-MGP FGF-23 , vascular calcification EBCT functional parameter arterial stiffness.Secondly , want optimize application CAC score population , classical contrast agent contra-indicated , add serological functional parameter score . Thirdly , aim study prognostic role parameter .</detailed_description>
