	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Biological therapy , aldesleukin , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Giving bevacizumab together aldesleukin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together aldesleukin work treat patient metastatic clear cell carcinoma kidney .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Aldesleukin Treating Patients With Metastatic Clear Cell Carcinoma Kidney</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate effect combination bevacizumab aldesleukin progression-free survival patient good- intermediate-risk metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma . Secondary - To determine objective response rate patient receive regimen . - To determine time progression patient receive regimen . - To evaluate immunomodulatory effect regimen patient - To evaluate toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day -14 , 1 , 15 , 29 , 42 aldesleukin subcutaneously day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 , 36-40 . Courses repeat every 8 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response completion study therapy may receive 1 additional course therapy . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
