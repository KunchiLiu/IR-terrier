	<brief_title>Effect Sitagliptin Graft Function Following Islet Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Sitagliptin take 12 month islet infusion significantly improve islet function compare control group . Purpose : To determine sitagliptin give time islet cell transplant ( ICT ) result improved islet graft function 3 12 month post-transplant . Study design : prospective , randomize , double-blind , single-centre , placebo-controlled trial . Sample size calculation primary outcome . The primary outcome ( stimulated insulin secretion ) continuous variable normally distribute . Our previous clamp study show expect standard deviation around 20 % wish able detect increase 33 % . The result calculate without adjustment number IE / kg patient receive , since literature clear issue . Analysis do use two-sided test . Sample size estimate use approximation Lehr 's formula 80 % power 2-sided significance level 5 % . = 16 = δ δ = 33 % , σ = 20 % 2 σ The calculation indicate need 6 patient per arm total 12 patient 2 arm . Ability site perform study Since start 2003 , perform 75 islet infusion 31 patient , average one infusion per month . We 1 4 active site North America ( Edmonton , Miami , Minnesota others ) . We list patient activate wait suitable islet donor . We anticipate great majority patient choose participate trial . We easily able perform require 12 islet infusion within 2 year . The advantage perform study single therapy ability keep constant variable eligibility criteria recipient choice immunosuppressive drug differ considerably centre . This approach increase chance question pose answered study . Eligible patient Eligible patient transplant program undergo infusion donor islet . Criteria entry program describe ( Warnock et al Arch Surg 2005 ; 140:735 ) . All eligible patient offer chance enter study . Patients need sign informed consent approve Clinical Research Ethics Board University British Columbia . Randomization Blinding Random number computer generate placed opaque seal , numbered envelope . The ratio sitagliptin placebo 1:1 . The pharmacist associate islet transplant team team member knowledge code sitagliptin placebo . Randomization do block four . The advantage block randomization allow similar distribution among group change performance islet transplantation , new immunosuppression regimen , could arise course study . There stratification . Randomization do prior islet infusion patient receive either placebo sitagliptin give medication receive islet . The subject investigator obtain consent , perform transplant , provide post-transplant care perform hyperglycemic clamp blind whether subject receive sitagliptin placebo . The placebo supply Merck identical appearance sitagliptin . Sitagliptin placebo store VGH pharmacy . When subject consent participate study , investigator obtain consent contact pharmacy . The pharmacy open next randomization envelope dispense medication ( sitagliptin placebo ) . Ongoing supply medication provide pharmacy transplant clinic routine follow-up visit post-transplant care . Patient Care All aspects transplantation procedure , immunosuppressive therapy ancillary care perform describe ( Warnock et al Arch Surg 2005 ; 140:735 ) similar patient duration study . The indication stop restart insulin recommend metabolic monitoring committee Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry . This eliminate subjective investigator judgment could affect one secondary endpoint ( insulin dose ) . Assessment endpoint Primary : Maximum insulin secretory capacity determine hyperglycemic glucose clamp , perform described ( Al Ghofaili et al Transplantation 2007 ; 83:24 ) . This perform 3 12 month ± 2 week islet infusion , subject receive either sitagliptin placebo period . The medication stop 48 hour clamp allow washout . A positive result would suggest sitagliptin increased functional islet mass , act short-term secretagogue . The value express absolute number divide number IE / kg receive clear literature well measurement . A baseline fast C peptide drawn prior islet infusion . Secondary : Patients follow closely post transplant maintain tight glucose control . Insulin adjustment glucose target describe . The average daily insulin requirement week transplant week prior stop study use calculation . A positive result would consistent either increase functional islet mass stimulation insulin secretion .</detailed_description>
