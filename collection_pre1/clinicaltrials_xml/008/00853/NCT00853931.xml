	<brief_title>Biomarker - Panitumumab Response With KRAS Wild Type MCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colon cancer affect 20,000 Canadians year . Despite effort improve screening , 8,500 patient die disease ( 1 ) . The agent use adjuvant metastatic set dramatically change past ten year . Even optimal treatment careful follow-up many patient develop metastasis . For incurable condition median survival patient 2 year ( 2 ) . Therapy 5-Fluorouracil ( FU ) /Leucovorin , oxaliplatin irinotecan without bevacizumab conventionally use first second line therapy metastatic colorectal cancer . Third line therapy option limit anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) therapy Cetuximab Panitumumab either monotherapy combination Irinotecan . Recent data ( see Table 1 ) demonstrate KRAS mutation status predictor benefit anti-EGFR therapy , wild-type tumour demonstrate response rate 10-17 % monotherapy 0 % response rate observe among KRAS mutant tumour . The purpose exploratory study examine correlation biomarkers ( PTEN , BRAF , amphiregulin , c-MET , EGFR ) response rate among patient KRAS wild type tumour treat panitumumab . If high response subgroup identify , may support use Panitumumab combination therapy first line set . Secondary objective determine prognostic predictive value CTCs patient treat single agent panitumumab describe overall survival ( OS ) progression free survival ( PFS ) register patient .</detailed_description>
