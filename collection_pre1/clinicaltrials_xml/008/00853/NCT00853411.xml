	<brief_summary>Asthma clinical syndrome well recognize health care practitioner , yet asthma pathogenesis still remain poorly understood . Asthma affect approximately 20 million Americans , suffer around 5,000 death annually . More 70 % people asthma also suffer allergy . Although many advance understand pathophysiology asthma make past decade , study necessary achieve thorough understand asthma cellular molecular level . The majority murine model suggest asthma `` allergic '' response involve activation Th2 cytokine pathway , include IL-4 -13 . Similarly human , several line evidence support large role Th2 adaptive immunity . These include large majority asthmatic patient atopy ; measurement increase amount Th2 cytokine , include IL-4 IL-13 airway sputum mild asthma ; recently , observe efficacy anti-IgE therapy `` allergic '' asthma . However , data , include large number subject atopy asthma , suggest Th2 adaptive response insufficient explain many aspect asthma . Whether innate adaptive immune pathway interact human asthma clear , study begin address interaction vitro vivo . For reason , investigator study would like prospectively enroll patient know asthma follow asthma exacerbation , treat standardize protocol . Over six week 's duration , investigator would like study patient collect physiologic data spirometry , biologic material form sputum , nasal scraping , venous blood , exhale breath sputum . It aim fully characterize impact prostaglandin/cycloygenase/eicosanoid pathway relate asthma exacerbation recovery . Completion study human asthma may provide new mechanistic insight relationship innate adaptive immune response influence course asthma exacerbation . The information obtain research correspond study may lead innovative medical therapy insight role epithelium interaction innate adaptive immunity .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All adult ( age 18 old ) moderatesevere persistent asthma identify physician Comprehensive Lung Center UPMC network physician , individual selfreferred asthma research center consider enrollment . All subject involve research design first participate clinical test characterize absence respiratory disease severity asthma . Clinical test include : spirometry methacholine challenge ( necessary diagnosis ) allergy test nitric oxide monitor . These test perform part research design adult subject age 1860 . Only patient inhaled corticosteroid ( CS ) regularly dose &gt; 200 micrograms/day ( fluticasone equivalent ) enter trial . There upper limit CS dose . The presence follow exclude patient study enrollment : Subjects mental handicaps Subjects obvious low respiratory tract bacterial infection ( pneumonia ) Subjects unable provide consent directly appropriate legal representative find provide consent Subjects previously indicate wish enrol study . A great five pack year history smoking current smoking . A prior diagnosis vocal cord dysfunction , cystic fibrosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder well lung disease besides asthma , coronary artery disease , hypertension , diabetes renal failure wellcontrolled deem principal investigator . Use 5 lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton Regular use aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory ( intermittent use allow , patient ask take acetaminophen exacerbation phase trial antipyretic/analgesic medication require .</criteria>
