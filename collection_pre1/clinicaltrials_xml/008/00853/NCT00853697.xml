	<brief_summary>Usually , male hormone testosterone make prostate cancer cell grow . Lowering testosterone usually stop growth prostate cancer . However , period time without testosterone , prostate cancer cell learn grow . You able join trial prostate cancer grow even though low level testosterone . Studies show high dos testosterone , situation , cause prostate cancer cell stop grow . The investigator study several year ago investigator give high dos testosterone patient . The investigator show give testosterone situation safe . The investigator also show investigator could , case , make PSA go use high-dose testosterone . The investigator believe improve type treatment combine testosterone another drug call dutasteride . Dutasteride another type hormone . It make testosterone level rise . The investigator believe combination dutasteride testosterone powerful regimen cancer testosterone alone .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients histologically confirm castrationresistant metastatic prostate cancer evidence disease progression . Patients must castrate state either orchiectomy GnRH analogue minimum one year . In detail , meet follow criterion : Adult male &gt; = 18 year age Histologically confirm prostate cancer , currently progressive disease , define rise PSA ( 50 % increase level 2 ng/mL , base least 3 PSA determination obtain least 1 week apart ) , 2 new osseous lesion bone scan , soft tissue disease progression RECIST 1.1 criterion , appearance new site disease ( MRI/CT ) . Evidence metastatic disease , document within 4 week prior dutasteride treatment initiation , base : CT MRI abdomen pelvis , and/or Radionuclide bone scan ( case find suspicious spinal metastasis , MRI spine perform rule epidural disease ) Serum PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL within 4 week prior dutasteride treatment initiation order register protocol Normal organ function acceptable initial laboratory value document within 4 week prior dutasteride treatment initiation : WBC &gt; = 3000/µL Platelets &gt; = 100,000/µL Creatinine &lt; = 2 mg/dL Bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 X ULN ( institutional upper limit normal ) AST/ALT &lt; = 2 X ULN Karnofsky performance status &gt; = 70 % Willingness undergo serial blood draw purpose measure CTCs biomarkers . MSKCC patient need agree participate MSKCC protocol 90040 Molecular study clinical correlation human prostate cancer [ PI : Scher ] . Also , MSKCC patient undergo serial imaging FDHT FDG PET scan , protocol 00095 [ 18f ] fluoro2deoxyDglucose [ 18f ] dihydrotestosterone PET image patient progressive prostate cancer ( PI : Morris ) , depend tracer scanner time availability . If study open center outside MSKCC , center exempt procedure link MSKCC Protocol # 00095 . ADT treatment least 12 month prior study entry serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients meeting follow criterion eligible study entry : Evidence smallcell neuroendocrine pathologic feature Uncontrolled urinary obstruction Osseous metastatic disease imminent risk ( discretion treat physician ) pathologic fracture cord compression ( patient know spinal metastasis raise concern cord compression , MRI spine perform rule epidural disease ) Any situation , discretion treat physician , potential `` tumor flare '' would lifethreatening Sleep apnea ( unless good control current treatment ) Polycythemia vera History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biological composition dutasteride Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness social situation would compromise compliance study requirement Currently active secondary malignancy ( determined treat physician ) nonmelanoma skin cancer Use follow medication prohibit study : Current and/or previous use follow medication : Finasteride ( Proscar , Propecia ) dutasteride ( GI198745 , Avodart ) exposure within 6 month study entry .
