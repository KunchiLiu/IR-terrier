	<brief_title>A Comparison Islet Cell Transplantation With Medical Therapy Treatment Diabetic Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Purpose The purpose study determine islet cell transplantation ( ICT ) effective intensive medical therapy reduce progression diabetic retinopathy . Hypothesis ICT result less progression diabetic retinopathy intensive medical therapy . The null hypothesis state difference ICT intensive medical therapy chance progression diabetic retinopathy . Study design : prospective , single-centre , randomized clinical trial Outcome Assessment Main Efficacy Outcome The primary outcome measure composite consist progression DR , development significant ME , moderate visual loss patient significant ME randomization . The definition term describe . The unit analysis individual eye eye count progress . Rationale Primary outcome Progression either DR DME clinically meaningful since threaten vision . Since chance progression one manifestation diabetic eye disease independent chance progression , combine endpoint progression either designate primary outcome . Progression condition assess differently do use generally accept criterion . The primary eligibility criterion level DR since benefit find initial study identify . We attempt determine benefit intervention ( ICT ) level DR PRP indicate therefore vision threaten . For reason , two three definition progression use surrogate outcome , one use clinical outcome visual acuity . Surrogate outcome use predict clinical outcome interest establish level DR . The appropriate outcome measure ME depend severity . For patient without CSME , surrogate outcome proportion progress CSME . For CSME , appropriate outcome clinical measure incidence moderate visual loss . ( PKC-DRS2 2006 , Hauser 2008 ) Progression Diabetic Retinopathy define either : 1 . An increase 2 grade individual eye 2 . Development PDR ( grade ≥ 61 ) The progression must present 2 consecutive visit separate least 4 month . Progression Macular Edema define either : 1 . In eyes central subfield mean thickness ( CSMT ) measure OCT &lt; 300 μm baseline , development CSMT &gt; 300 μm AND increase &gt; 50 μm . 2 . In eye CSMT measure OCT &gt; 300 μm baseline , vision loss ≥ 15 letter . VA measure use ETDRS protocol . ( ETDRS 1991c ) . The outcome development moderate visual loss , decrease ability read 15 letter 90 letter scale . This correspond loss 3 line visual acuity double visual angle ( eg 20/20 20/40 ) . The progression must present 2 consecutive visit separate least 4 month . Sample Size Calculation Metabolic control , baseline retinopathy diabetes duration independent predictor progression PDR ( Porta 2001 , Skrivarhaug 2006 ) . A recent study examine effect protein kinase C inhibition progression DR enrol subject similar spectrum DR severity plan study ( PKC-DRS 2005 ) . The progression rate 3 year study 50 % , low estimate 64 % ( ETDRS 1991c ) . We use conservative estimate 50 % sample size calculation . We anticipate 30 % subject significant ME time randomization 25 % group experience moderate visual loss 3 year . ( Klein 1998 , PKC-DRS2 2006 , PKC-DRS 2005 ) Of anticipated 70 % without significant ME randomization , 25 % expect develop ME 3 year ( ETDRS 1985 ) . Since risk progression 25 % whether ME present entry , sample size calculation influence proportion recruit population different project 30:70 This literature analysis suggest composite endpoint expect occur 75 % control group 3 year . For conservative purpose , rate 65 % use calculation . We wish able detect 50 % reduction rate 32.5 % . For α = .05 power 80 % , 36 eye ( 18 subject ) need group . We plan recruit 20 subject group ( total 40 ) allow dropout 10 % . Ability perform study Our rate donor pancreases suitable ICT average 1/month since begin March 2003 ( Thompson 2008 ) . Although 2 pancreas usually require allow subject become insulin independent , find benefit ICT microvascular complication begin single islet infusion , whether subject able stop insulin . Therefore , able sufficient donor allow 20 subject receive islet infusion 2 year . For conservative purpose , allow unexpected event decrease availability donor pancreas , allow 3 year subject randomize . Step 1 - Recruitment It anticipate subject identify routine-care examination endocrinologist ophthalmologist . The Islet Transplant Program make ophthalmologist endocrinologist British Columbia aware study believe recruitment come physician . They ask provide subject potentially eligible express interest contact information . Subjects able contact program phone ( 604-875-5997 ) , fax ( 604-875-5925 ) email ( isletlab @ interchange.ubc.ca ) . Step 2 - Initial Meeting When subject identify themself interested study , contact phone study coordinator ask schedule preliminary meeting PI study coordinator provide information study . At end meeting give informed consent document read consider . There time limit give subject determine wish enter study . Subjects remain interested proceed next step . Step 3 - Further Assessment : component step 3 occur simultaneously 3a Suitability ICT Meeting transplant team ensure eligibility subject understand risk transplant procedure immunosuppression . 3b Intensive medical therapy Subjects begin intensive insulin management , current program , ensure able comply aspect study prior randomization randomize medical arm . This necessary ICT compare best available current treatment . Failure maintain regular contact nurse-clinicians , perform regular glucose monitoring achieve A1c &lt; 8.0 end assessment consider reason exclude subject study . 3c Ocular assessment Complete eye examination include 7-field fundus photo , visual acuity OCT confirm eligibility . The photography perform certified photographer Eye Care Centre . These photo read one investigator ( ISB ) locally . The time complete step 3 estimate approximately 2 month . Step 4 Team meeting investigator make decision subject regard enrollment study . Eligible subject ask sign inform consent time . Step 5 Subjects consider enrol study continue intensive medical management base 2008 CDA guideline . Failure comply requirement intensive therapy disqualify patient study . Randomization block : 8 subject per block blood group A O 4 subject per block group B AB . Eight subject chosen common blood group make highly likely least 4 would cross-match negative particular donor thus eligible receive islet infusion donor . The small number use less common group participate study . All subject remain intensive medical therapy block full . Steps 6 7 A complete block activate . Prior activation , subject understanding trial , willingness accept assign treatment group commitment follow-up schedule confirm . Half subject randomly assign receive ICT half continue intensive medical therapy duration study . If study demonstrate ICT effective medical therapy prevent progression diabetic retinopathy , subject receive ICT part study offer chance ICT part ongoing care . The random number sequence generate computer number place numbered , opaque , seal envelope store locked islet transplantation laboratory . These prepared subject enrol . Each number , seal envelope contain two additional seal unmarked envelope - one contain randomization number medical treatment ICT . Randomization occur time donor become available . The two best match subject donor identify . This identification require agreement least two investigator . In presence least 2 investigator , number envelope obtain islet lab open . The name one subject write one seal , unmarked envelope name subject envelope . Only envelop open reveal code . One subject randomize receive ICT continue medical therapy . No new subject blood group activate half receive ICT half randomize medical therapy . At time , another group subject blood group activate . Assessment study outcomes begin time randomization 2 subject ( one ICT , one medical ) . A complete ocular assessment perform within 1 week randomization . Follow-up Phase Blinding The subject investigator administer intervention necessity aware treatment allocation . The outcome assessment blind follow manner . The eye photographer technician perform photograph VA test aware subject receive transplant . Once collect information mark unique identifier ship University Wisconsin Fundus Photograph Reading Center analysis . The assessor center unique identifier number therefore know treatment subject receiving . Outcome Assessment Ocular assessment ( complete eye exam , ETDRS best correct VA , Fundus photo , OCT ) perform every 4 month ± 1 month time randomization . Islet transplantation Islet isolation transplantation perform describe ( Warnock 2005 ) . Subjects receive ≥ 5,000 IE/kg initial infusion consider receive complete islet transplant receive ≥ 12,000 IE/kg 1 - 3 infusion . Post-transplantation Care Subjects follow Solid Organ Transplant Clinic Vancouver General Hospital describe ( Warnock 2005 ) Diabetes Management Diabetes care provide accord standard recommend Canadian Diabetes Association 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines . Subjects follow closely describe ( Warnock 2005 ) Duration Follow-up : 3 year time last patient randomize Statistical Analysis The unit analysis individual eye . Analysis intention-to-treat . At end study , proportion eye treatment group reach primary outcome compare Chi-square analysis . There interim data analysis . The DCCT find transient early worsening DR occur first two year intensive therapy analysis time would provide inaccurate information long-term benefit treatment begin appear three year follow-up ( DCCT 1995b ) .</detailed_description>
