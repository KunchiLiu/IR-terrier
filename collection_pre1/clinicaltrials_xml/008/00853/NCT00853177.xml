	<brief_title>MEOPA Breathing Analgesia Oocyte Retrieval ( KALOVAL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oocyte retrieval major event VITRO-fertilization , without sperm micro-injection . Initially do laparoscopy general anesthesia , oocyte collection carry trans-vaginal control ultrasound puncture . This potential painful event , relate trans-vaginal puncture mechanical movement stimulate ovary , require analgesia anesthesia . General anesthesia certainly effective term collect oocyte . It remain , however , heavy time consumer , personal risk distributor anesthetic agent blood follicular fluid . These product could deleterious effect early embryonic development implantation . Few data available concern risk literature . General anesthesia still essential pusillanimous patient patient heavy surgical past . Nitrous oxide inhale gas property widely use obstetric parturition . It regularly use general anesthesia perform oocyte retrieval . With gas compose 50 % N2O 50 % O2 , main interest provide analgesia state conscious sedation . The effect nitrous oxide form never assess clinical biological Oocyte collection . We conduct preliminary study ass pain patient receive local anesthesia , accord current protocol . Thus , 44 % patient severe pain ( VAS &gt; 40/100 ) transvaginal oocyte retrieval . In preliminary experience , immediate distance post-operative pain high plan evaluate benefit analgesia nitrous oxide term immediate post-operative pain prospective , randomize control study compare local anesthesia associate Alprazolam .</detailed_description>
