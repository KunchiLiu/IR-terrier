These investigator share common interest goal enhance wide-spread adoption CDS tool service improve delivery healthcare domestically world-wide . Our approach project iterative cyclical : begin survey knowledge management lifecycle support infrastructure ( knowledge management system , terminology service data standard ) participate clinical site . We work together define best practice translate knowledge multi-layered array human readable knowledge artifacts public web service . At point process , conduct careful evaluation , document lesson learn site . The ultimate work product fall three main category : First , tangible , actionable knowledge artifact shareable , human-readable computable form clinical practice guideline ( CPGs ) study , public web-services CDS demonstration , CDS Knowledge Portal Repository facilitate widespread adoption artifact . Second , detail guidance recommendation , base learn combine effort , external party Certification Commission Health Information Technology ( CCHIT ) , Health Information Technology Standards Panel ( HITSP ) , clinical practice guideline developer community . Third , set knowledge best practice , method knowledge management lifecycle , development human readable knowledge artifacts machine-interpretable knowledge , management decision-support related organizational change .
