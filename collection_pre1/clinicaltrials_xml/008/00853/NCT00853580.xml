	<brief_summary>The specific aim study determine whether Lovastatin ™ significantly improve visual spatial learn and/or sustain attention child NF1 . Secondary Aims : To evaluate effect Lovastatin ™ measure executive function , behavior quality life child NF1 cognitive deficit . To evaluate toxicity tolerability Lovastatin ™ child NF1 cognitive deficit . Hypotheses It hypothesize Lovastatin ™ improve visual spatial memory and/or attention deficit child NF1 . This base study demonstrate Lovastatin ™ significantly improve impairment visual spatial memory attention NF1 murine model . It expect Lovastatin ™ safe well tolerated 16-week period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study Lovastatin Children With Neurofibromatosis Type 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This prospective multi-centre randomize , placebo-controlled Phase II study determine efficacy Lovastatin ™ visual spatial learn and/or attention ability child NF1 age 8 less 16 year . In addition , effect Lovastatin ™ secondary measure executive function , visual spatial skill , behavior quality life assess . Participants randomize 16-weeks treatment Lovastatin ™ match placebo . It plausible ethical employ placebo group standard therapy establish efficacy withheld . There cross-over study due lack data concern length possible washout effect . The Lovastatin ™ dose begin 20 mg daily/continuous dose escalate two-week period 40 mg daily/continuous dose continue dose 14 week . Participants carefully monitor side effect . The safety Lovastatin ™ evaluate use laboratory test , clinical sign adverse effect , monitor regular interval 16-week period . Primary secondary outcome measure administer baseline , 16 week post-treatment follow-up , 8 week cessation treatment determine carry-over effect . The safety Lovastatin ™ also evaluate , regular monitoring side-effects trial . Study Population This Phase II study involve child NF1 ( age 8 year 15 year 11 month old time enrollment ) evidence cognitive impairment , define score least one standard deviation population mean measure visual spatial learn and/or attention . A total 142 participant NF1 age 8 year 15 year 11 month enrol study . The age limit select basis Lovastatin ™ show safe child age 8 17 year old . In addition , one primary outcome measure ( attention ) normative data 15 year 11 month . Therefore , maximum age limit participant time enrolment 15 year 11 month normative data use determine whether participant impair . The pediatric NF1 population ideal group study cognitive effect Lovastatin ™ represent opportunity early pharmacological intervention cognitive deficit .</detailed_description>
