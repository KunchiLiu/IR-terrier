	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether skin biopsy specimens patient diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis ( dcSSc ) use biomarkers ( measure activity type ) disease predict response various experimental treatment . There various experimental treatment use treatment slceroderma , way predict response give therapy . The investigator use DNA microarray analyze change gene expression skin biopsy response various treatment . Our hypothesis investigator see change gene expression response various treatment give u insight cause scleroderma . The investigator predict able use information predict experimental treatment beneficial individual patient</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) autoimmune connective tissue disease primarily affect young middle-aged woman . The pathogenesis SSc complex involve interplay three seemingly diverse process : autoimmunity , vasculopathy , fibrosis . Patients experience vary degree disable skin thicken potentially life-threatening internal organ fibrosis vasculopathy , way accurately predict disease subtype risk severity progression . Current experimental treatment SSc include oral intravenous cyclophosphamide mycophenolate mofetil blunt immune response , autologous stem cell transplant may reset immune system , imatinib mesylate may reduce fibrosis . Recent excite genomics research lab collaborator suggest skin biopsy sample obtain patient SSc robust alteration gene expression profile compare control . Changes expression gene know involved profibrotic pathway prominent . The present proposal describe novel experiment evaluate genomic approach couple clinical data identify patient subset , predict response treatment , good understand molecular basis disease pathogenesis , treatment response . The Northwestern Scleroderma Program ( NSP ) novel multidisciplinary program accelerate SSc research provide comprehensive care &gt; 400 SSc patient . Standardized clinical information include demographic , laboratory , diagnostic data ( echocardiography , high resolution chest computerized tomography , pulmonary function test ) well DNA currently collect patient enter clinical database . NSP patient offer option donate dermal tissue genomic analysis use previously establish , optimize approach extract RNA tissue sample . We hypothesize DNA microarray technique permit analysis change gene expression skin patient undergo dermal biopsy treatment identify unrecognized profibrotic pathway addition provide new , important information regard know fibrotic pathway . The knowledge gain deepen understanding molecular pathway involve fibrosis , also provide mean reliably predict patient likely respond various treatment . Relevance : SSc devastate orphan connective tissue disease know cure . There disease biomarkers accurately predict disease subtype risk internal organ involvement progression present . Using well-established genomic technique , current proposal investigate change gene expression profibrotic pathway dermal biopsy various treatment correlate clinical response . If , genonic analysis dermal tissue may useful good understand molecular pathogenesis SSc disease biomarker .</detailed_description>
