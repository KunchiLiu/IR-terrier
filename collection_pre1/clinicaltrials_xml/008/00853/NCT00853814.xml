	<brief_summary>Increased access highly reinforce sedentary behavior home TV computer associate overweight youth . Reducing behavior reduces overweight prevents increase overweight youth risk , likely increase physical activity and/or reduce energy intake . Reducing access highly reinforce sedentary activity frees-up time youth must choose reallocate time engage , less reinforce sedentary activity physical activity . Neighborhood environment provide easy access reinforce physical activity park may result great increase physical activity access highly reinforce home sedentary behavior reduce . The investigator find 3 data set youth range age 4 16 year proportion park recreation area residential area within ½ mile child 's home parcel ( park recreation index ) independently predict physical activity youth . The investigator also find increase physical activity access sedentary behavior reduce 3 week relate park area within ½ mile child 's home . The aim study decrease access home sedentary behavior 4 month determine change physical activity habit related access park recreation area neighborhood environment . The investigator propose study 128 sedentary overweight male female 12-14 year-old youth recruit parcel within Erie County , New York high low park recreation index . Groups match racial/ethnic distribution socioeconomic status . Subjects live low high park access parcel equally randomize group reduce target sedentary behavior ( TV , computer use ) time 50 % use TV Allowance device place TV/monitor home control group experimental experience include TV Allowance device place TV/monitor , program limit access target sedentary behavior . Subjects wear accelerometer wrist-watch-type global positioning system determine change duration intensity physical activity various parcel type , include park . The investigator hypothesize differential response physical activity utilization park physical activity . The group youth live parcel high access park incur 50 % reduction sedentary behavior great increase physical activity , number visit park accrue great physical activity park youth 3 treatment group . The investigator hypothesize alteration physical activity mediate parent model physical activity individual difference motivation physically active . The investigator hypothesize main effect reduction access sedentary behavior energy fat intake percent overweight .</brief_summary>
