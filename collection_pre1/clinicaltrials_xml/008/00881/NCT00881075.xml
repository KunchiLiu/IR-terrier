	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness manganese-based agent call SeeMore ( EVP 1001-1 Injection ) enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) patient previously heart attack . It determine whether SeeMore make easy find damaged area heart evaluate well patient feel body react receive study medication . Adult patient previously heart attack stable health may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , brief physical examination blood urine test . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Collection blood urine sample 24 hour receive SeeMore 24 hour . A blood sample also take 3 10 day receive drug . - MRI scan one hour receive SeeMore 10 minute receive drug . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . After first ( baseline ) MRI do , SeeMore give intravenously ( vein ) subject 's vital sign electrocardiogram ( EKG ) monitor 10 minute . Then second MRI do determine whether study medication make easy see area heart affect heart attack . - Check vital sign , EKG physical examination second MRI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase II open-label , baseline-controlled study . Approximately 10 adult male nonpregnant female patient know myocardial infarct ( nonacute ) intend enrol current dose . Prior entry study , subject undergo standard physical examination include medical history , detail regard prior myocardial infarct ( ) , prescription over-the-counter drug questionnaire , vital sign , ECG , evaluation major organ system , hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis . In addition , female subject undergo serum pregnancy test . All subject sign Informed Consent prior entry study . EVP 1001-1 administer intravenously approximately one minute . Safety assess monitor vital sign , ECG , blood test give EVP 1001-1 . MRI perform EVP-1001-1 measure enhancement relative area myocardial infarction .</detailed_description>
