	<brief_summary>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH ) occur diaphragm fails fully fuse leave portal abdominal structure migrate thorax . In severe case , abdominal structure remain thoracic cavity compromise development lung . Infants born defect decrease capacity gas exchange ; mortality rate birth report 40-60 % . Now CDH accurately diagnose mid-gestation , number strategy develop repair hernia promote lung tissue development . Fetal tracheal occlusion one technique temporarily close herniated area Goldvalve balloon allow lung develop increase survival birth . This pilot study cohort fetus affect severe CDH undergo FETO demonstrate feasibility perform procedure , manage pregnancy period tracheal occlusion , removal device prior delivery BCM/Texas Children 's Hospital ( TCH ) . It anticipate fetal tracheal occlusion plug-unplug procedure improve mortality morbidity outcomes compare current management , primary endpoint feasibility study . We perform 20 FETO procedure fetus diagnose prenatally severe extremely severe CDH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fetal Endotracheal Occlusion ( FETO ) Severe Extremely Severe Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrollment Women carry fetus severe extremely severe CDH normal karyotype undergo routine clinical evaluation . The fetus 27+0/7 29+6/7 week gestational age severe CDH early 22+0/7 week gestational age deem `` extremely severe '' case CDH . They ultrasound and/or MRI evaluation rule anomaly , calculation LHR ultrasound measurement , echocardiography , detailed obstetric/perinatal consultation . Patients meet eligibility criterion extensively counsel , wish participate provide write , inform consent study . Procedure The procedure perform spinal anesthesia local anesthesia intravenous sedation . The technique fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion describe . Using standard technique , cannula load pyramidal trocar insert amniotic cavity fetoscope flexible operate endoscope pass cannula amniotic fluid . If , upon evaluation , baby access way describe , uterus access incision belly ( call laparotomy ) . A laparotomy surgical technique make incision abdomen . After incision make , uterus temporarily reposition externally . The baby access use fetoscope ultrasound , describe . The laparotomy do baby reach reposition favorable one external maneuver ( call external version ) FETO procedure . The scope guide fetal larynx either nostril via nasal passage fetal mouth , fetal vocal cord aid direct vision scope cross-sectional ultrasonographic visualization . A detachable latex balloon place fetal trachea midway carina vocal cord . The balloon inflate isosmotic contrast material fill fetal trachea . Postoperative The mother discharge stable . Serial measurement sonographic lung volume LHR begin within 24-48 hour follow surgery continue weekly target ultrasound evaluation . Amniotic fluid level membrane status also monitor weekly interval . Comprehensive ultrasonography fetal growth perform every four week . All discharge patient stay within 30 minute TCH permit standardize postoperative management emergent retrieval balloon event preterm labor premature rupture membrane prior schedule removal . After FETO surgery , prior leave hospital , mother give medical alert bracelet identify patient baby block airway . She encourage wear bracelet time case emergency , others know contact . She also give pamphlet instruction medical personnel describe remove balloon case emergency . She carry time . Balloon retrieval plan 32+0/7 34+6/7 week discretion FETO center . The patient need commit remain 30 minute Texas Children 's Hospital Pavilion Women balloon retrieve . After removal balloon , patient choice deliver Texas Children 's Hospital- Women 's Pavilion CDH manage repair TCH , return obstetrician delivery subsequent repair CDH pediatric surgeon refer facility . Given severity CDH , baby need deliver facility capability immediate pediatric surgery service . We need monitor baby regular interval ( 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 2 year ) delivery see well baby breathe well baby develop . These check- ups may Texas Children 's Hospital- Women 's Pavilion coordinate doctor participant 's choosing . If child continue care another institution , attempt follow review child 's medical record .</detailed_description>
