	<brief_summary>This study patient head neck cancer receive chemotherapy radiation therapy disease . The purpose study see investigator use genetic difference patient select right drug use radiation therapy . This type genetic testing call pharmacogenetics . Currently two drug use treat head neck cancer provide benefit give radiation compare radiation alone previous study . These two drug cisplatin cetuximab ( Erbitux ) . In trial , investigator test whether genetic difference patient use pick drug receive . A recent study look back see well patient head neck cancer respond treatment cisplatin show genetic difference gene associate survive cancer . The investigator take find use test patient genetic difference determine whether receive cisplatin cetuximab . In word , investigator try take essentially flip coin choice two drug , instead use individual patient 's genetic difference make-and hopefully improve- choice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment-naive patient locally advanced , non-metastatic ( Stage III IVB ) squamous cell carcinoma head neck candidate concurrent chemoradiotherapy primary therapy curative intent enrol . Patients genotyped variation four SNP loci 3 gene involve DNA nucleotide excision repair ( ERCC1 , ERCC2 , XRCC1 ) . Patients 3 8 variant receive cisplatin , patient 2 few variant receive cetuximab .</detailed_description>
