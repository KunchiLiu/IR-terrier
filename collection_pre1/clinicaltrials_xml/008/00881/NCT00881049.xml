	<brief_title>Trial Imatinib ( GleevecÂ® ) Selected Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion enrol . The estimated recruitment duration 1 year . Imatinib give dose 400 mg orally day unless disease progression intolerance . The follow-up 12 month . Forty-eight subject recruit study . This sample size justified number patient required establish improvement PFS statistical significance compare historical control . The standardized RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) method unidimensional tumor assessment employ evaluate tumor lesion size per 2 month determination response rate progression free survival . Repeated radiographic assessment 4 week interval consistent general oncological practice associate computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan test . All efficacy endpoint evaluate investigator . Safety characterize term incidence , timing , severity , relatedness adverse event laboratory abnormality . Severity grade accord NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 .</detailed_description>
