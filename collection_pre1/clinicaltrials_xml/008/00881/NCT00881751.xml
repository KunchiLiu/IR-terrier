	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Erlotinib sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bevacizumab , erlotinib , sorafenib may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give bevacizumab together erlotinib effective give sorafenib treat patient liver cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together erlotinib work compare sorafenib first-line therapy treat patient advanced liver cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate overall survival patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma treat bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride v sorafenib tosylate . Secondary - To estimate event-free survival tumor response rate patient . - To evaluate safety tolerability regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . - Arm II : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
