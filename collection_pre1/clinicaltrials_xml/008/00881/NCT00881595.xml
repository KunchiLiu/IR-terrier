	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate effect temozolomide radiation combination treatment intend soft tissue sarcoma . This study also look tumor tissue remove initial biopsy final surgery information may help treat soft tissue sarcoma future . In addition investigator examine sample normal tissue ( optional ) inside mouth/cheek ( compare tumor tissue ) start treatment .</brief_summary>
