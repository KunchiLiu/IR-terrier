	<brief_summary>Patients type cancer call NHL , Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) CLL . The lymphoma , MM CLL come back go away treatment . There standard treatment cancer time currently use treatment work completely case like . This gene transfer research study use special immune cell . The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease , antibodies T cell , investigator hope work together . Antibodies type protein protect body bacterial disease . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include tumor cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer ; show promise , strong enough cure patient . T lymphocytes kill tumor cell normally enough able kill tumor cell . Some researcher take T cell person 's blood , grown laboratory give back person . The antibody use study recognize protein lymphoma , MM CLL cell call kappa immunoglobulin . Antibodies stick lymphoma , MM CLL cell recognize kappa molecule present tumor cell . For study , kappa antibody change instead float free blood join T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . These chimeric receptor-T cell seem kill tumor , n't last long chance fight cancer limit . In laboratory , investigator find T cell work well also add protein stimulates T cell grow call CD28 . By join anti-kappa antibody T cell add CD28 , investigator expect able make cell last long time body ( presence CD28 ) . They hop make cell work well . Previously , patient enrol study , assign one three different dos kappa-CD28 T cell . We find three dose level safe . Now , plan give patient high dose test . These chimeric T cell ( kappa-CD28 ) investigational product approve FDA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To prepare lymphoma , MM CLL specific T cell investigator take 240 ml ( 16 tablespoonful ) blood patient . This would draw 2 ( two ) separate blood collection 120 ml ( 8 tablespoonful ) blood . To get kappa antibody ( CD28 ) attach surface T cell , investigator insert antibody gene T cell . This do virus call retrovirus make study carry antibody gene T cell . This virus also help investigator find T cell patient 's blood 're inject . Because patient receive cell new gene patient follow total 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . Several study suggest infuse T cell need room able grow accomplish function may happen many T cell circulation . Because , level circulate T cell relatively high patient B-CLL , patient may receive treatment cyclophosphamide fludarabine ( Cy Flu ) prior infusion T cell . This drug decrease number patient T cell infusion kappa-CD28 T cell . Although investigator n't expect effect tumor dose patient receive , drug part many regimen use treat lymphoma , MM CLL . If already receive chemotherapy , may need . Patients give injection cell vein IV line . If s/he receives Cy Flu state , T cell give sooner 24 hour afterwards . If patient recently receive chemotherapy , T cell give least 24 hour last chemotherapy . The injection take 20 minute . Investigators follow patient clinic injection . The treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital . If 4-6 week evaluation period infusion , patient seem experience benefit ( confirmed radiological study , physical exam and/or symptom ) , patient may able receive additional dos T cell wish . These additional infusion would least 4-6 week apart dose level receive first time lower dose . If patient 's circulate T cell relatively high prior additional dos T cell , may receive Cy Flu beforehand .</detailed_description>
