	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , proton radiation high tumor dose ( low normal surround lung dose ) combine standard chemotherapy lung cancer . The dose receive tumor high standard dose . This may able increase control tumor . Due accuracy radiation give proton , dose normal lung tissue surround tumor lower standard . This may able reduce frequency severity usual radiation side effect .</brief_summary>
