	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study surgery remove sentinel lymph node axillary lymph node chemotherapy treat woman stage II , stage IIIA , stage IIIB breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery Remove Sentinel Lymph Node Axillary Lymph Nodes After Chemotherapy Treating Women With Stage II , Stage IIIA , Stage IIIB Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter study . Patients plan receive receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy eligible . Patients undergo examination breast axilla lymph adenopathy undergo ultrasound axillary node prior registration confirm eligibility completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Within 12 week complete neoadjuvant chemotherapy , patient undergo mastectomy lumpectomy ( per surgeon discretion ) include sentinel lymph node surgery axillary lymph node dissection . The primary secondary objective study describe . Primary Objective : 1 . To determine false negative rate sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) surgery . Among patient least one sentinel lymph node identify remove , false negative rate define number patient declare evidence cancer SLN find least one positive lymph node ALND divide total number patient least one positive axillary lymph node ALND . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine axillary ultrasound status patient upon completion preoperative chemotherapy ( evidence residual lymphadenopathy ultrasound examination versus evidence lymphadenopathy ultrasound examination ) affect false negative rate SLN sonographic finding correlate residual disease final pathology . 2 . To determine node status patient preoperative chemotherapy . Patients classify node positive determine least one positive lymph node SLN ALND . Patients classify node negative node examine SLN ALND negative . 3 . To determine whether false-negative rate SLN surgery preoperative chemotherapy relate extent residual cancer burden ( RCB ) overall , separately breast regional nodal basin . 4 . To evaluate pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate ( define invasive disease breast lymph node ) disease-free survival ( DFS ) rate node-positive patient receive preoperative chemotherapy . After completion surgery , patient visit office follow-up exam 1-2 week patient follow every 6 month 2 year , yearly 2 year , every year 6 year . The study close accrual treatment 5/29/12 .</detailed_description>
