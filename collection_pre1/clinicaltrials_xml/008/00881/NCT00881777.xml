	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine safety potential effectiveness new surgical procedure treat heart failure . The experimental treatment perform standard coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery , applies radiofrequency energy heat portion damage heart muscle . The tissue heating reduces enlarge heart patient suffer ischemic heart failure , may result heart pump blood efficiently , thereby improve functional status patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Radiofrequency Heating Cardiac Infarction Scar Treat Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure important health-care problem , result significant number patient , hospitalization , economic cost . The etiology heart failure coronary artery disease approximately two-thirds case , majority patient experience prior myocardial infarction . As consequence myocardial infarction , ventricle undergoes change volume shape , process refer `` ventricular remodeling '' . As left ventricle enlarges , global systolic function worsens , result heart failure . There number treatment option available minimize symptom somewhat slow disease progression . Unfortunately , even best conventional drug device therapy , heart failure patient continue high morbidity mortality rate . The experimental therapy investigate study use surgical device employ radiofrequency energy heat epicardial tissue . The application heat myocardial infarction scar cause shrink size , correspondingly reduce ventricular volume . The volume reduction may `` reverse remodel '' enlarge dysfunctioning left ventricle normal size shape . The intent clinical study evaluate whether radiofrequency heat myocardial infarct scar safe , determine result ventricular volume reduction translate improved clinical functional outcome patient suffer ischemic heart failure .</detailed_description>
