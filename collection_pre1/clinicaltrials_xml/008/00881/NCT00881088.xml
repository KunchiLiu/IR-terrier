	<brief_title>Prophylaxis Thromboembolic Complications Trial : Thromboprophylaxis Needed Below Knee Plaster Cast Immobilization Ankle Foot Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : A prospective , randomise , control , single blind , multi-centre trial . Intervention : After meet inclusion criterion state obtain informed consent , patient randomly assign three group : one receive Nadroparine ( 2850 IE anti-Xa = 0,3 ml , give daily ) , one receiving Fondaparinux ( 2,5 mg = 0,5 ml , give daily ) one receive prophylaxis . These dosage standard use thromboprophylaxis . The first two group instruct trained nurse subcutaneous self-injection medicine give pre-filled disposable syrinx once-daily administration duration immobilisation . In light current scientific knowledge placebo effect subcutaneous injection saline control group implausible since outcome measure ( colour duplex sonography ) objective one . Patients receive letter explain symptom suggest development deep-vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism adverse event ask contact emergency room would occur . All patient-information cod trace back individual patient . This coded information use publication . Outcome : At time removal plaster cast symptom sign suggestive DVT note colour duplex ultrasonography treat limb perform patient experienced technician accord strict diagnostic test protocol ( see enclosure 1 ) . When incompressibility vein lack flow diagnosis DVT make . The technician blind treatment . In case suspect pulmonary embolism pulmonary angiography perform . The following risk-factors DVT record : age , sex , body mass index ( BMI ) , current smoking , use estrogen-containing hormonal replacement therapy oral contraception , active cancer ( treatment go stop less one year ) , congenital acquire hypercoagulable state , previous deep venous thromboembolism varicose vein . Safety assess secondary outcome . Adverse event haematoma , bleed allergic reaction record .</detailed_description>
