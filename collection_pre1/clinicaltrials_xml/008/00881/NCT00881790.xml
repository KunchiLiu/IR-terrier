	<brief_title>The Behaviour Dental Nurses Applying Fluoride Varnish Young Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A preliminary study show follow : 1 . Ethical permission work attainable Research Ethics Committee . 2 . Parents willing give consent child participate study . 3 . Dental nurse willing give consent behaviour video record within work setting . 4 . Video recording feasible nursery school child , EDDNs parent present nursery school set . 5 . The technical difficulty collect audio-visual material nursery school setting ( e.g. , camera placement , storage video data field set ) anonymising video data use specialist mask software overcome . 6 . Importing video file Observer XT cod software successful . 7 . Development cod system nurse-child interaction involve clinical procedure achieve ( see Appendix 1 brief version cod scheme ) . We collect video recording 50 varnish application session pilot study separate child 6 nurse three nursery school . The pilot study therefore successfully demonstrated feasibility collect high quality data suitable intensive analysis improve understanding process involve fluoride varnish application nursery school setting . One interesting finding pilot study permission-seeking statement use EDDNs negatively correlate treatment outcome . Summary next phase study : - To confirm suitability preliminary coding scheme potentially refine improve cod scheme use large set observational data collect nursery school setting across three NHS Health Board region . - Further investigation ass generalisability pilot study finding collect large set observation child systematically across wider set nurse pairing ( various level experience ) child ( different age group : 3yrs v 4 yr ) without previous receipt fluoride varnish application Childsmile programme . - To identify key feature nurse-child interaction use predict full completion fluoride application test hypothesis frequent target reinforcement effective . - To explore effect additional factor relation relevant participant ( e.g. , EDDN 's level experience , child 's previous dental experience ) situational factor ( e.g. , general purpose room specialist accommodation ) treatment outcome . - To develop additional training session EDDNs use finding study improve Childsmile programme increase acceptability varnish application . Methods Ethics proposal preparation We obtain ethic approval pilot study . We successfully address dealt ethical issue arise study pilot stage . We experience degree difficulty consent staff child recruitment pilot . We believe obtain ethical approval extend study achievable due previous experience . The difference pilot main study extension number child observation . This require multisite ethic proposal enter IRAS . In term ethical approval NHS Research Development ( R &amp; D ) office , work NHS Research Scotland ( NRS ) , assist obtain approval different NHS R &amp; D office . We welcome set nursing staff adverse effect work school collect 50+ child observation . In main study , collect approximately 500 child observation across several NHS Health Board region . We continue positive work relation EDDNs nursery school staff develop pilot stage . We careful consent recruitment nurse child participant without cause pressure participation . Anonymity personal detail confidentiality information provide participant deal carefully assign unique code participant research team member access code . We foresee additional new factor jeopardise approval application REC . Sample All EDDNs train Childsmile programme participate delivery varnish application nursery school setting three NHS Health Board region ( Tayside , Fife Forth Valley ) identify potential staff participant . All newly train EDDNs deliver varnish application nursery school child three region also include . All nursery school child three region mention whose parent consent Childsmile varnish application programme identify potential child participant . The parent child potential parent participant . Setting record cod system The Observer system consist powerful suite programme integrate input digital video file sound platform computer screen repeat playback real-time coding , diagrammatic display , simple categorical analysis complex sequential analysis . Various option available collection recording may vary accord set . Variables determine optimum system include : obtrusiveness camera microphone , quality video image require , ease use 'field ' . The pilot study show material collect 'field ' transfer onto university computer hard disc ready cod purpose . The picture quality position camera vary optimise study nurse-child interaction varnish application . Pilot observation In order check feasibility new record system use main study ( digital DVD camera instead web camera pilot stage ) , need make small number pilot observation nurse-child interaction . This process important ensure record video data successfully digitalize subsequently transfer Observer XT8.0 cod analysis . Although experience deal process pilot stage , take additional pilot observation still important step use new record system updated version Observer XT software main study . These pilot observation also use double check cod scheme develop pilot data function properly new set data . Preparation cod scheme The preparation cod scheme vital component study require considerable effort think develop suitable system cumbersome also detail enough illustrate various strategy adopt 'actors ' progress intervention . Of particular interest case unexpected behaviour event require inclusion profile interaction . For example child may refuse certain aspect varnish procedure require coax reassurance distraction . Interruptions procedure outside event , e.g . parental nursery nurse involvement , fire alarm present scheme include ignored subsequent analysis . The Observer XT system enable accurate collection code video . The advantage updated version Observer XT system modification cod scheme cod procedure . Previous version software allow 'luxury ' . Other available ( 'freeware ' ) cod system capability . Therefore , cod scheme develop pilot data test fit use new datasets collect main study cod scheme also potentially improve certain behaviour need include and/or modify . Collection observational data Observations nurse-child interaction record field use digital DVD camera . The video observation data , initially store DVD , transfer digital format store computer internal hard drive cod analysis . The Observer XT system stable digital video data read directly computer external hard disc ( e.g. , DVD ) , process digitalize video file store computer , therefore , important step successful behaviour cod data analysis . Each initial raw video file store DVDs assign unique code data protection purpose lock secure place . All digitalized video file store computer internal hard disc permanently remove computer cod analysis complete . These digitalize video file export onto external hard drive data encrypt access data file password protect . An audit record compile allow inspection progress video data file video DVD computer hard disc cod export external medium safe long-term storage . Audit monitor School Ethics Committee 6-month basis . Coding video data The research assistants responsible cod video data . This task labour- intensive highly skilled . There approximately 500 video clip process , require period 9-10 month complete . So far , specific cod scheme develop type nurse-child interactive behaviour . The new coding scheme ( Appendix 1 ) devise pilot study consist 40 code recently conduct reliability analysis scheme . There 86 % agreement use tolerance window 2 second coded event . The kappa statistic 0.84 ( p &lt; .001 ) . Reliability test The Observer XT appropriate reliability ( kappa ) statistical routine build software provide estimate agreement control random chance . See 'Coding video data ' reliability estimate cod scheme . Analysis data Video data The main software use cod analyse video data Observer XT 8.0 . The rationale cod analysis The Observer system two-folded , descriptive element . After verbal non-verbal behaviour nurse child cod accord cod scheme , cod behaviours along time point behaviour take place ( behaviour cod event ) duration time ( coded state behaviour ) store log file one particular nurse-child interaction . Frequencies certain behaviour calculate , example , nurse 's use praise fantasy statement ; whether use statement link positive application outcome . Second , explanatory element . Sequential analysis employ explore behaviour tend facilitate impede occurrence behaviour . The purpose type analysis understand complex behavioural relationship term nurse use motivational strategy encourage cooperative behaviour child receive varnish application .</detailed_description>
