	<brief_summary>The purpose investigator study characterize composition hard soft tissue present root canal teeth previously diagnose necrotic pulp incomplete root formation treat triple antibiotic regeneration protocol . The investigator hypothesis treatment teeth necrotic pulps immature apex triple antibiotic paste stimulate continue root formation deposition dentin root apex . The primary outcome measure histological identification mineralize tissue adherent cell apical third teeth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>'Regeneration ' refer protocol refers stimulation continued root formation deposition apical tissue subsequent disinfection necrotic root canal content creation scaffold upon cell proliferate . While propose treatment protocol currently use clinical practice show successful case report case series , nature proliferate apical tissue remain unknown . Thus , study uniquely position address critical gap knowledge regeneration functional pulp-dentin complex . Moreover , result obtain pediatric case may well provide essential foundation knowledge endodontists apply knowledge difficult situation regenerate pulp-dentin complex full mature permanent tooth .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient Healthy volunteer age 1060 nonrestorable ( determined refer dentist ) , permanent tooth necrotic pulp incomplete root development . Persons seem cooperative dental treatment able indicate willingness obtain treatment participate study capable verbally express dissent . Parents express understand study treatment consent treatment child regenerative procedure . Healthy patient ( ASA Class I II physical status ) systemic health problem may interfere heal cell growth . Tooth inclusion criterion : Permanent tooth necrotic pulp immature root development , schedule extraction due nonrestorability . Clinically confirm necrotic pulp confirm common endodontic pulp vitality test ( No response cold electric pulp test ) . Clinically confirm immature root development assess radiographically confirm nonrestorability diagnose refer dentist . Patient Parents patient unable give consent express dissent . Patients unwilling undergo dental treatment . Patients affect temporomandibular joint disorder . Patients affect known orofacial pain disorder . Patients ASA Class III IV physical status ( Immunocompromised patient include patient selfreport HIV carrier , undergo steroid therapy chemotherapy , selfreport genetic systemic disease could result reduce immune response ) . Tooth Teeth vertical crack extend cementoenamel junction . Teeth isolate use rubber dam . Teeth nonodontogenic pathology . Teeth whose apex fully develop , determine radiographically correlate dental age patient .</criteria>
