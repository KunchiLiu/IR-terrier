	<brief_summary>Since first introduction human 1962 , Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump ( IABP ) commonly use therapeutic option support fail heart cardiac surgery . The main effect IABP increase diastolic blood pressure therefore improvement coronary perfusion reduction ventricular load , thus increase stroke volume cardiac output . IABP-related complication include limb ischemia , bleed site IABP insertion , infection , aortic dissection . IABP could use preoperatively , intraoperatively , postoperatively . However , despite wide use device , optimal timing use IABP high-risk patient undergoing cardiac surgery remain controversial . Time insertion show affect hospital mortality , range 18.8 % 19.6 % preoperative insertion , 27.6 % 32.3 % intraoperative insertion , 39 % 40.5 % postoperative insertion . Several study , randomize non-randomized , conducted address impact preoperative use IABP outcome , study include relative small number patient . In effort increase strength result , two meta-analysis conduct published 2008 . The objective assess effect mortality morbidity use IABP preoperatively high-risk patient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) . Surprisingly , meta-analysis Field co-worker conduct four randomize control trial ( total 193 patient include ) publish author institution , make result conclusive although favourable toward beneficial effect preoperative use IABP . Moreover , two randomized trial conduct Christenson co-worker include mentioned meta-analysis , exclude meta-analysis Dyub co-worker consider duplicate . Unfortunately , one study Christenson co-worker include meta-analysis Dyub conduct off-pump surgery , introduce another bias criterion eligibility . At present unclear whether preoperative use IABP high-risk coronary patient schedule CABG operation lead good outcome . The experimental hypothesis present randomize , control trial ( RCT ) placement IABP immediately begin surgical procedure induces reduction major morbidity operation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perioperative Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump ( IABP ) Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ( CABG ) Operations Patients With Severely Depressed Left Ventricular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RCT include patient schedule elective CABG surgery ( without associate procedure ) leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 0.35 . Exclusion criterion : age &lt; 18 year , patient 's consent , contra-indications use IABP ( severe peripheral arteropathy ; endovascular abdominal aortic prosthesis ) . Patients randomly allocate either control group treatment group . Patients control group receive IABP preoperatively , patient treatment arm receive IABP position immediately induction anesthesia begin surgery . Randomization perform day operation . Primary endpoint : reduction major morbidity rate ( define either prolonged ( &gt; 48 hour ) mechanical ventilation , acute renal failure , mediastinitis , surgical revision , stroke ) . Secondary endpoint : reduction inotropic drug use , shorten mechanical ventilation ICU stay . Interim analyse stop rule : interim analyse do half ( 80 patient ) 2/3 ( 106 patient ) recruitment . The trial could prematurely stop case difference primary endpoint reach P value 0.005 first analysis , 0.01 second.A specific stop rule settle operative mortality ( 30 day ) 0.01 first interim analysis 0.05 second interim analysis . Given invasive nature cost intervention , stop rule futility settle case lack difference primary outcome . This settle relative risk primary outcome include hypothesize value 0.5 within 99 % CI first interim analysis 95 % CI second .</detailed_description>
