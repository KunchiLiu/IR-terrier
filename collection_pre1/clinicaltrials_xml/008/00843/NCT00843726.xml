	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Stereotactic body radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know regimen radiation therapy effective treating patient non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study side effect two radiation therapy regimens see well work treat patient stage I stage II non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage I Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare incidence toxicity two establish stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) regimens patient node-negative , peripheral stage I II non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - To compare quality life , pattern failure , disease-free survival , overall survival patient treatment one two establish SBRT regimen . - To correlate outcome toxicity image patient tumor biomarkers . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord Karnofsky performance status treatment center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo 1 high-dose fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) . - Arm II : Patients undergo 3 high-dose fraction ( approximately 1 week apart ) SBRT . Quality life assess periodically EORTC QLQ-C30 -LC13 questionnaires Blood tissue sample may collect periodically examined biomarkers via ELISA immunoblotting . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
