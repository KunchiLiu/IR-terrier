	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine incidence duration hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) reduce use FreeStyle Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitoring System people Type 1 diabetes mellitus good glycemic control . The investigator hypothesize access real-time continuous glucose concentration data along alarm enable people type 1 diabetes reasonable metabolic control reduce time spend hypoglycaemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Real-time continuous glucose monitoring expect allow patient reduce glycaemic fluctuation improve ability achieve tight glycaemic control without increase incidence fear hypoglycaemia availability high fidelity real-time glucose data alarm throughout day . As well adult , may particularly important child adolescent type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) . Study Overview : This multicentre , prospective , randomise , control , intervention study , conduct 3 study centre ; Ljubljana Slovenia , Tel Aviv Israel Stockholm Sweden . The aim enroll 100 subject ( 50 adult 50 paediatric ) , enrol 120 eligible subject allow dropout . The subject population randomly assign 50:50 either control group intervention group . Subjects asked participate 7 month , consist one-month 'run-in ' period SMBG follow 6-month test period . Enrolment take place within 16-week period . A blood sample take centralized baseline measurement HbA1c . To include study subject must HbA1c level inclusion 7.5 % All subject undergo one-month run-in period . Each subject give FreeStyle blood glucose meter strip perform self monitor blood glucose ( SMBG ) accord standard glycaemic management regime , advise health care professional ( HCP ) . Subjects require return clinic end run-in period another blood sample take centralized measurement HbA1c randomly assign Group 1 ( intervention ) Group 2 ( control ) next 6-month test period . Group 1 require use FreeStyle Navigator CGM manage glycaemic control , wear individual sensor series five day duration , next six month . Group 2 continue study next 6 month use SMBG manage glycaemic control FreeStyle meter strip provide . Every second week subject wear 'masked ' FreeStyle Navigator sensor 5 day . Subjects encourage alternate day wear FreeStyle Navigator sensor , data obtain day week weekend . Subjects return clinic 3 month 6 month ( enter study test-phase ) centralize HbA1c measurement . Subjects ( parent paediatric subject ) within intervention group also ask complete subject satisfaction questionnaire experience device .</detailed_description>
