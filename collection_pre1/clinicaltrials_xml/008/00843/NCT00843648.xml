	<brief_summary>The immune system dynamic , constantly evolve network . Excluding autoimmune disease , healthy individual also know large number circulate antibody recognize protein tissue . These antibody know natural antibody previous study suggest feature `` self '' component share individual certain physiological state . Thus , monitor self immunoglobulin provide overview various state immune system . To , process obtain system biology view immune system , newly develop Antigen Chip technology use . To investigate subject plan carry broad investigation conduct collaboration group Prof. Eshel Ben-Jacob university Tel-Aviv Prof. Irun Cohen Weizmann Institute require experimental analytical expertise facility . The study include follow-up immune state baby mother several month post birth use Antigen Chip analyze Immune holography method . The investigation also include comparative study immune signature different body fluid , effect feed , effect method time labor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Antibody reactivity traditionally study individual reactivity one antigen , whereas small number study focus repertoire antibody large number define antigen . Only recently , new technology system level analysis , immune microarrays ( antigen chip ) introduce [ Quintana 2004 , Quintana Cohen 2004 , Robinson 2006 ] . This technology capable detecting pattern antibody bind many hundred antigen , foreign self thus allow system biology view immune system . To create antigen chip , robotic apparatus use spot antigen molecule choice - protein , peptide , sugar , lipid , nucleic acid - coat glass slide . These antigen covalently link surface slide drop blood serum body fluid test antibody bind hundred antigen spot . The subject 's bound antibody detect use fluorescence-labeled second antibody reaction monitor laser activation .</detailed_description>
