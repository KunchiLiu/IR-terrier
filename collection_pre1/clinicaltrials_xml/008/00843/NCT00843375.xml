	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy current state-of-the-art screening procedure detect colorectal cancer . However , compliance screening procedure public low variety reason . New screen tool need improve detection colon cancer . Biomarkers stool , urine , serum , tissue plasma may provide valuable initial screening tool sort population need colonoscopy likely . This cross-sectional study subject undergo clinically-indicated colonoscopy diagnose colorectal cancer willing provide biospecimens .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Stool Based Markers Early Detection Colorectal Cancers Adenomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recognition fact novel potential biomarkers continually identify need validate rapid , efficient scientifically rigorous manner , NCI make enormous commitment development network facilitate biomarker development validation multiple organ site . As part National Cancer Institute-funded Early Detection Research Network ( EDRN ) , Great Lakes-New England Clinical Epidemiological Center ( GLNE CEC ) propose research study validate potential molecular marker ( `` biomarkers '' ) detection precancerous cancerous condition cancer risk assessment . Although examples biomarkers currently clinical use ( i.e . CEA , CA-125 ) , limitation . Our consortium focus gastrointestinal neoplasia . The goal phase propose research : 1 . Assessment utility individual stool-based , serum-based urine-based biomarkers discriminate patient adenocarcinomas , patient adenomas , patient without adenomas normal subject . 2 . Assessment utility individual stool-based , serum-based urine-based biomarkers detect indicator carcinogenesis know present present adenoma , adenocarcinomas , normal mucosa . 3 . Construction panel marker consider Objectives 1 2 discriminate , number assumption concern prevalence cost misclassification , : Subjects normal colon versus patient without adenoma , patient adenomas patient cancer ; b Subjects normal colon , patient without adenomas patient adenomas , versus subject cancer ; c Subjects normal colon versus patient without patient adenomas versus patient cancer . 4 . Comparison characteristic individual marker panel discriminator establish current standard , Fecal Occult Blood test ( FOBT ) . 5 . Development bank stool sample link serum , tissue , urine clinical data patient colorectal cancer , adenomas normal control validation stool-based marker may develop future . To meet goal investigator propose collect stool , rectal mucus , serum , plasma , urine sample 800 subject ( 200 colorectal cancer , 200 adenoma , 200 high risk normal 200 normal colon control ) . The stool sample assay stool-based biomarkers . EDRN Common Data Elements ( CDEs ) complete recruit site provide laboratory develop assay .</detailed_description>
