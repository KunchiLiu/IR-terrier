	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) multiorgan autoimmune disease characterize fibrosis skin internal organ . Cardio-pulmonary manifestation systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) patient significant impact prognosis . Several element heart lung involvement encounter frequently combination . Clinically apparent SSc cardiac involvement recognize poor prognostic factor , experience frequent cause death among SSc patient . Moreover arrhythmias , diastolic less frequently systolic dysfunction considerably interfere quality life patient . Cardiac involvement include primary cardiac disorder like fibrosis contractile element , ischemia due involve microcirculation and/or epicardial coronary secondary one like consequence systemic pulmonary hypertension . Autopsy identify fibrosis myocardium 80 percent case . Its distribution unrelated epicardial coronary stenosis , inflammatory process think play substantial role evolution . Microvascular disease ( MVD ) cause reduction vasodilatory capacity independently epicardial coronary disease ( CAD ) , know several decade . Short term benefit vasodilatory treatment also report late study . Symptoms element cardio-pulmonary involvement overlap coronary abnormality alike MVD also find asymptomatic patient . Recently prevalence CAD report similar gender , age symptom match control . Atypical clinical presentation predominant nevertheless finding indicate SSc patient free CAD . Clarification cause reduced exercise capacity , chest pain faint SSc challenge task require multidisciplinary approach . Driven high mortality due recent emergence effective therapy SSc patient regularly screen pulmonary hypertension ( PAH ) . Clinical presentation scleroderma relate PAH unspecific . Fatigue , chest pain dyspnea may relate organ , lung , musculoskeletal system esophagus . The definitive diagnosis PAH still depend result right heart catheterization ( RHC ) . As non-invasive diagnostics influence extent restrict multiple clinical manifestation , RHC perform liberally symptomatic patient . Still considerable proportion patient underwent RHC normal pulmonary pressure cause symptom may remain obscure cardiac involvement may correctly diagnose entirely overlook . We intend characterize coronary artery disease symptomatic SSc patient mean prospective cross-sectional study consist organize screen SSc patient systematic leave heart catheterization ( coronary angiography , coronary flow reserve estimation ) patient refer RHC . Prognostic impact different manifestation determine five-year follow-up study .</detailed_description>
