	<brief_title>Combination Revlimid , Melphalan Dexamethasone First Line Treatment Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current multiple myeloma therapy , typically induction regimen follow consolidation therapy high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell rescue ( autologous transplantation ) , induce remission relapse death inevitable . A grow body literature suggest consolidation therapy autologous transplantation confer additional survival benefit may increase procedure-related morbidity mortality patient 65 year old . Autologous transplantation longer recommend standard care population . In addition , certain patient may eligible autologous transplantation due co-morbid medical condition may elect undergo procedure personal reason . The historic standard care multiple myeloma patient eligible autologous transplantation consolidation induction therapy melphalan/ prednisone ( MP ) , often follow form maintenance therapy achievement complete partial remission . A recent phase 3 study show addition thalidomide MP ( MPT ) demonstrate high overall complete response rate . For patient eligible autologous transplantation , thalidomide/ dexamethasone ( Thal Dex ) induction therapy consider standard care , phase 2 study lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) / dexamethasone ( Rev Dex ) induction therapy demonstrate high overall complete response rate compare Thal Dex . In addition , lenalidomide favorable side effect profile compare thalidomide . Based data , hypothesize combination Revlimid/ melphalan/ dexamethasone ( ReMeDex ) induction therapy myeloma patient plan autologous transplantation due age restriction factor may demonstrate high overall and/ complete response rate fewer side effect .</detailed_description>
