	<detailed_description>By use patient screening questionnaire measure hair nicotine , well acknowledge biomarker exposure tobacco smoke , attempt objective study examine association tobacco smoke chronic rhinosinusitis . ( CRS ) Likewise , zinc deficiency document numerous animal human study decrease resistance infectious disease especially common among smoker . We explore hypothesis SHS exposure zinc deficiency contribute CRS . To accomplish , measure serum zinc hair nicotine level CRS patient correlate variety CRS diagnostic indicator . A second objective study investigate alteration within epithelium lining sinonasal cavities patient chronic rhinosinusitis . The alteration may one combination anatomic , genetic , inflammatory , infectious etiology . To investigate possibility plan take residual clinical material endoscopic sinus surgery specimens perform various vitro investigation include limited microarray analysis , northern western blot analysis , ciliary beat frequency analysis , immunohistochemistry , electron microscopy , propagation tissue tissue culture technique . Tissues take non-sinusitis patient undergo sinonasal surgery serve non-chronic rhinosinusitis control source sinus mucosa .</detailed_description>
