	<brief_title>A Comparison Pharmacokinetics Safety Long-acting Injectable Risperidone When Administered Gluteal Deltoid Intramuscular Injection Sites Stable Schizophrenia Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open label , single dose , multicenter , 2-way crossover study comprise screen phase , 2 open-label treatment period , end-of-study evaluation . The study population comprise patient chronic stable schizophrenia . Patients allow continue exist oral antipsychotic treatment throughout study , receive disallow mediation , per protocol . Patients randomly allocate receive treatment 1 2 panel . In panel , patient receive single intramuscular injection long-acting injectable risperidone treatment period , 2-way crossover design . In Panel I , patient receive 25 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via gluteal muscle 37.5 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via deltoid muscle study period . In Panel II , patient receive 50 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via gluteal muscle 50 mg long-acting injectable risperidone via deltoid muscle . There washout period 85 day administration study drug . The primary outcome comparison pharmacokinetic parameter area curve ( AUC ) peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) 37.5 mg deltoid versus 25 mg gluteal , 50 mg deltoid versus 50 mg gluteal . Safety assess screening , throughout open-label treatment phase , end study early withdrawal use combination adverse event ( include occurrence extrapyramidal symptom assess Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale ) , clinical laboratory test ( hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis , pregnancy test ) , vital sign , physical examination , electrocardiogram , injection site evaluation . The study hypothesis intramuscular injection long-acting injectable risperidone via gluteal deltoid sit bioequivalent route administration , measure peak total drug concentration plasma , safety tolerability profile 2 injection site comparable . The patient receive single injection long -- act injectable risperidone ( 25 mg , 37.5 mg 50 mg ) gluteal deltoid muscle 2 treatment period .</detailed_description>
