	<detailed_description>Millions Americans suffer circadian rhythm sleep disorder , include shift work sleep disorder , jet lag , delay sleep phase syndrome possibly winter depression . These condition typically characterize persistent insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness , impaired performance , gastrointestinal distress . These negative symptom result misalignment timing external social world time internal circadian ( body ) clock . Circadian rhythm sleep disorder effectively treat bright light , phase shift circadian clock , thereby realign time external social world . It widely recognize social influence lead increase prevalence sleep restriction modern society . We recently demonstrate first time short sleep episode , compare long sleep episode , markedly reduce phase advance bright light . Thus people cut sleep short , inadvertently reduce circadian responsiveness bright light . The mechanism ( ) behind reduced phase shift light unknown . However , least two aspect short sleep episode could responsible effect . First , short sleep episode associate partial sleep deprivation . Second , humans sleep eye close usually expose light awake , short sleep episode also associate short dark length . Our overall goal determine biobehavioral mechanism short sleep episode impair phase shift bright light . Specific Aim 1 determine effect partial sleep deprivation phase advance light , control dark length . Specific Aim 2 determine effect short dark lengths phase advance light minimize sleep deprivation . We estimate time human circadian clock measure salivary melatonin , neuroendocrine hormone release pineal gland , collect measure sleep via actigraphy , sleepiness , mood , gastrointestinal distress cognitive performance via computerized assessment . Characterization separate effect sleep deprivation dark length circadian phase shift light human critical understanding human respond light daily life activity . Furthermore , finding research produce important practical recommendation avoid decrement phase shift light , thereby optimize bright light treatment circadian rhythm sleep disorder , thus improve public health safety , well-being , mood , cognitive function , quality life .</detailed_description>
