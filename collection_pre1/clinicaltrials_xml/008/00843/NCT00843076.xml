	<brief_summary>Chronic infection hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) common cause liver disease , may progress cirrhosis eventually liver cancer . The therapeutic indication depend mainly importance liver damage ( fibrosis ) , assess physical technique , blood test liver biopsy . The overall objective project understand HCV variability may influence severity steatosis ( accumulation fat liver ) , study 30 patient chronically infect HCV ( half patient infected HCV genotype 3 , versus half infect HCV another genotype ) . A small portion biopsy perform routine pathology examination place special fixation buffer electron microscopy ( EM ) . Counting measure size lipid droplet present liver EM use precisely quantify characterize liver steatosis . A blood sample patient also collect sequence viral genome present patient identify amino acid involve increase intracellular accumulation lipid droplet . This work clarify impact viral variability severity steatosis . Ultimately , identification viral sequence responsible increase phenomenon could crucial understanding mechanism involve steatosis .</brief_summary>
