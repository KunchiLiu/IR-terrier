	<brief_summary>Developmental dysplasia hip common musculoskeletal disorder infancy , report prevalence 2 % newborn . Although newborn screen program base clinical examination Ortolani Barlow test introduce 1950 's 1960 's early abduction splint 2 % test positive , prevalence late case warrant surgery remain stable , around one per 1000 . This led introduction ultrasound additional diagnostic tool , result treatment rate 5-6 % . This three fold increase abduction splint treatment partly due initiation treatment infant mild hip dysplasia hip instability identify . The benefit early treatment mild dysplasia hip neither dislocate dislocatable unclear . Further , abduction splint without risk , avascular necrosis report around 1 % . The investigator conduct masked , randomize , control trial examine whether mildly dysplastic stable instable hip would benefit early treatment , compare watchful waiting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>140 newborn stable ( dislocatable dislocate ) mildly dysplastic hip , bear Maternity Hospital , Haukeland University Hospital , 1997 onwards . The newborn randomly assign one two group ( number seal envelope , see flow chart ) . Because newborn recruit high risk group ( 60 % positive family history 35 % breech ) , risk factor consider equally distribute two study group . Stratification therefore consider unnecessary . For control , treatment start age 1.5 month case persistent dysplasia , i.e . α-angle &lt; 50º , treatment continue treatment group α-angle ≤53º . At 3 month , treatment discontinue α-angle ≥55º start α-angle &lt; 55º . Treatment continue beyond 3 month discontinue AI within two standard deviation accord reference value Tönnis Brunken . The study require randomisation 128 subject two equally sized group obtain 80 % statistical power detect 3º difference α-angle . Less 128 infant require detect similar difference AI radiography . To compensate expect rate ineligibility loss follow-up ten per cent , 140 patient enrol . PRACTICAL ISSUES The clinical hip-examinations perform maternity ward day 1-3 , physician least 2 year pediatric experience . The hip joint classify stable , unstable , dislocatable dislocate . TM responsibility clinical re-examination prior enrollement . Ultrasound screen newborn increase risk CDH common practice maternity unit . Newborns eligible present study recruit high-risk group ( 13 % newborn ) . To avoid inter-examination bias , ultrasound examination perform one examiner ( KR ) , use GE RT 3000 , 5 MHz linear probe KKB , ATL HDI 3000 machine 5 MHz linear probe Acuson 10XP , 5 MHz linear probe Section Pediatric Radiology ) . The ultrasound examination perform accord modify Graf procedure ( Rosendahl ) , include hip morphology hip stability . Newborns stable hip confirm mild dysplasia second ultrasound examination re-examined clinically TM , HR TA prior invitation study . After write informed consent give , patient attend patient clinic BKB . A nurse open seal envelope random number , newborn enter control treatment group . All data export SPSS KR .
