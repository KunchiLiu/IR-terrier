	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) currently fourth lead cause death United States , morbidity mortality COPD continue rise . Despite magnitude problem , therapeutic option limit - particularly comparison cardiovascular disease . Smoking cessation essential treatment prevention COPD . However , although smoking principal cause COPD , minority smoker develop symptomatic COPD many former smoker develop COPD year decades stop smoke . The medical intervention proven reduce mortality COPD supplemental oxygen therapy . There therefore urgent need new understandings pathophysiology COPD might lead development good therapy COPD . MESA-Lung ancillary ongoing Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) . MESA-lung utilize various exist measure endothelial function already collect MESA ( flow-mediated dilatation [ FMD ] relate biomarkers gene polymorphism ) test hypotheses endothelial dysfunction occur clinical COPD .</detailed_description>
