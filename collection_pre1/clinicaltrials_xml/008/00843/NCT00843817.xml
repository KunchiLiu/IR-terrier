	<brief_summary>Serine protease belong elastase family mainly responsible lung tissue destruction observe cystic fibrosis . But anti-inflammatory therapy base systemic aerosolize protease-inhibitors administration , give expect result . One reason would impair access therapeutic inhibitor molecular target . It recently show neutrophil actively secrete neutrophil extracellular trap ( NETs ) make DNA bind cationic protease among molecule . NETs together DNA passively release dead neutrophil contribute viscosity CF expectoration explain rhDNase treatment fluidifies expectorations improve patient status . Preliminary experiment laboratory show DNA degradation associate significant increase proteolytic activity sputum soluble fraction . However efficacy exogenous inhibitor also improve condition . Using specific substrate methodology develop previously measure cell-surface associate proteolytic activity , study effect DNase activity individual protease , biodistribution sputum regulation potential therapeutic inhibitor . Enzymatic , immunochemical microscopic ( confocal scanning ) technique first use ex vivo study sputa freshly collect adult paediatric CRCM Tours , sputa patient administration aerosolize rhDNase . We hypothesize well understanding biodistribution neutrophil serine protease especially bind DNA help design new therapeutic strategy facilitate inhibitor access protease target .</brief_summary>
