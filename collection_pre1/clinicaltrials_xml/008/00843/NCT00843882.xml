	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study lenalidomide see well work without epoetin alfa treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome anemia . Lenalidomide may stop growth myelodysplastic syndrome block blood flow cell . Colony stimulate factor , epoetin alfa , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . It yet know whether lenalidomide effective without epoetin alfa treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome anemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide With Without Epoetin Alfa Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare rate major erythroid response ( MER ) lenalidomide monotherapy combine treatment lenalidomide epoetin alfa erythropoietin non-responsive low-/intermediate-1 ( Int-1 ) -risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) patient erythropoietin treatment naïve patient low probability erythropoietin benefit . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare time MER treatment assignment . II . To evaluate duration MER treatment assignment . III . To estimate frequency MER salvage combination therapy patient fail experience MER lenalidomide monotherapy . IV . To evaluate compare frequency minor erythroid response treatment assignment . V. To investigate mechanism target lenalidomide action patient chromosome 5q31.1 deletion . VI . To evaluate frequency cytogenetic response progression , relationship cytogenetic pattern erythroid response . VII . To evaluate frequency bone marrow response ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) . VIII . To evaluate relationship erythroid response laboratory correlate outline : pretreatment study endogenous erythropoietin level ( Arm A ) ; evaluate effect cluster differentiation ( CD ) 45 isoform profile lenalidomide enhancement erythropoietin-induced signal transducer activator transcription 5A ( STAT5 ) phosphorylation CD71^Hi erythroid precursor relationship erythroid response ; characterize molecular target relevant lenalidomide cytotoxicity del5q31.1 cell ; evaluate frequency cryptic chromosome 5q31.1 deletion patient non-del5q31.1 MDS array-based genomic scan , determine relationship hematologic response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Patients del 5q31.1 karyotype assign Arm A . ARM A : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . ARM B : Patients receive lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 epoetin alfa subcutaneously ( SC ) weekly . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course . Patients achieve major erythroid response ( MER ) may continue treatment beyond 4 course absence disease progression , disease conversion acute myeloid leukemia , unacceptable toxicity . Patients Arm A fail achieve MER achieve MER relapse 16 week treatment lenalidomide may crossover receive treatment Arm B . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
