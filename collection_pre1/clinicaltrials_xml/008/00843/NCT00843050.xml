	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety P276-00 Relapsed and/or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite response rate 97 % first-line standard high-intensity chemotherapy , without stem-cell transplantation , patient mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) relapse.Prognosis MCL first relapse poor median survival around 1 2 year . Therefore , novel therapy require relapse and/or refractory MCL.Overexpression Cyclin D1 result ( 11 ; 14 ) ( q13 ; q32 ) translocation hallmark MCL.It postulate Cyclin D1 may also oncogenic role independent pRb MCL.Therefore , inhibition Cdk4-Cyclin D1 potentially promise target MCL . P276-00 potent Cdk4-Cyclin D1 inhibitor worth explore efficacy MCL . Hence , Phase II study plan examine efficacy safety P276-00 treatment patient relapse and/or refractory MCL . This open-label , single-arm , 2-stage trial . Approximately 35 patient plan enrol study obtain total 25 efficacy evaluable patient ( patient complete least 2 cycle study treatment tumor measurement end 2 cycle ) . A total 15 efficacy evaluable patient plan treated Stage I study . If ≥1 response ( CR PR ) duration ≥2 stable disease ( SD ) ≥4 cycle see Stage I , study continue Stage II , additional patient treat 10 additional efficacy evaluable patients.The study divide 3 period : Screening , Treatment , Follow-up . During Screening Period , patient provide write informed consent evaluate inclusion exclusion criterion . During Treatment Period , patient administer P276-00 intravenous ( iv ) infusion Days 1 5 21-day cycle minimum 6 cycle maximum 12 cycle , progressive disease ( PD ) unacceptable toxicity occur . Safety efficacy evaluation do Days 1 5 11 cycle , Day 21 every 2 cycle . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) assessments do Cycle 1 , Day 1 ( pre-dose post-dose time point ) , optional biomarker assessment do pre-dose within 4 week Day 1 post-dose Day 4 5 . The End-of-Last-Cycle Visit occur end Cycle 6 , patient continue study treatment beyond Cycle 6 , occur end patient 's last cycle ; patient discontinues early , assessment do Early Exit Visit . The Follow-up Visit occur 4 week ( ±1 week ) End-of-Last-Cycle Visit ( Early Exit Visit ) final safety assessments.Objective response rate primary end point study . Response evaluation perform use International Working Group ( IWG ) revise response criterion malignant lymphoma .</detailed_description>
