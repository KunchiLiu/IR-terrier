	<brief_summary>This study do determine whether possible use investigational vaccine consist dendritic cell patient pancreas cancer . Dendritic cell immune cell obtain blood important body 's immune response foreign substance . The vaccine would inject directly tumor spread liver short course radiation therapy give tumor . The study try determine treatment would safe effective treating cancer . This phase 1 pilot study treatment . Phase 1 trial test best way give treatment little known possible risk benefit . Phase 2 study test possible benefit treatment may show specific situation see . Promising treatment test Phase 3 trial compare new treatment standard treatment large group patient . Phase 4 trial conduct treatment approve general use outside research . A pilot study test treatment small number patient learn treatment could test large group . Pilot study perform phase commonly perform early phase research treatment .</brief_summary>
