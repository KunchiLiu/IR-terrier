	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Fondaparinux Prevention Venous Blood Clots Patients With Plaster Cast Other Type Immobilization Below-knee Injury Not Needing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design evaluate efficacy safety fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg ( 1.5 mg patient creatinine clearance 30 50 mL/min ) daily versus Low-Molecular Weight Heparin ( nadroparin 2850 anti-Xa IU , 0.3 mL , daily ) , respect occurrence venous thromboembolism , death bleeding complication patient require rigid semi-rigid immobilization least 21 day 45 day isolated nonsurgical below-knee injury . Treatment continue complete mobilization , e.g . plaster cast brace removal , maximum 45 day . The study European , multicentre , randomize , open-label , control , two-parallel-group , phase III study 1350 male female patient 18 year age old , present least one additional major risk factor VTE . After randomization ( Day 1 ) , subject receive subcutaneously , daily , either fondaparinux nadroparin complete mobilization . After cast brace removal , systematic , bilateral compression ultrasound do patient . Patients contact five week ( ± one week ) complete mobilization . All suspect venous thromboembolic event , include asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis , death , bleed event ( exception certain type minor bleed event define protocol ) review independent adjudication committee blind treatment assignment .</detailed_description>
