	<detailed_description>Aphasia ( difficulty speak ) one dread consequence stroke . It associate high mortality severe motor , social , cognitive disability . During past decade , therapy administer stroke team make great stride limit damage due stroke . Unfortunately , progress aphasia rehabilitation experience rapid advancement . Evidence suggest brain may untapped potential recovery aphasia stroke . Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , researcher able examine area brain responsible language recovery stroke . Such data may explain brain recovers stroke , may lead new therapy help individual suffer aphasia-causing stroke . In study , researcher examine change brain undergoes recover aphasia-causing stroke mechanism underlie recovery , test effectiveness new promise method aphasia rehabilitation call constraint-induced aphasia therapy ( CIAT ) . The scientist perform fMRI study brain activation people suffer aphasia-causing stroke order well understand underlie mechanisms recovery aphasia . Specifically researcher compare language activation adult stroke child perinatal postnatal stroke ( previous study ) ; map change language activation , characterize pattern language reorganization occur follow stroke ; use fMRI measure assess recovery use CIAT . The study last one year , time participant language test evaluate degree aphasia recovery ; five fMRI scan schedule 2 week , 6 week , 12 week , 26 week , 56 week . Participants remain moderate aphasia offer chance participate extension treatment study last 3 month ( STUDY ) . A good understanding brain change recovery aphasia may help develop new method improve recovery .</detailed_description>
