	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine correlation supplemental sulforaphane ( broccoli sprout extract ) dose concentration sulforaphane metabolite blood urine sample woman positive cancer , ductal carcinoma situ and/or atypical ductal hyperplasia . - To determine effect supplement biomarkers prognosis patient . - To determine effect supplement HDAC inhibition peripheral blood cell normal cancerous breast tissue sample patient . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Sulforaphane Supplement : Patients receive oral broccoli sprout extract supplementation three time daily 2-8 week absence unacceptable toxicity . - Placebo : Patients receive oral placebo supplementation three time daily 2-8 week absence unacceptable toxicity . Blood urine sample collect baseline completion study treatment laboratory biomarker study . Patients schedule undergo surgery ( mastectomy lumpectomy ) also undergo breast tissue sample collection baseline time surgery . Samples analyze sulforaphane metabolism ( isothiocyanate level ) , HDAC activity ( acetylate histone expression ) , cell proliferation ( Ki-67 index IHC ) , apoptosis ( TUNEL assay ) . Patients complete questionnaire baseline periodically study dietary history , family history , cruciferous vegetable intake , adverse event , dietary medication change . After completion study therapy , patient follow at/around 30 day .</detailed_description>
