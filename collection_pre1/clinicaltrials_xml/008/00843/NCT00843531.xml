	<detailed_description>Preclinical data suggest concomitant inhibition two non-redundant amplify pathway ( mTOR EGFR ) reverse drug resistance profoundly affect tumor growth target either pathway alone . EGFR inhibitor may abrogate feedback loops stimulate upstream signal event PI3K Akt face mTOR inhibition . Although ErbB receptor signal mTOR-dependent mechanism , mTOR-independent ErbB receptor signal also occur cancer . Furthermore , deregulation apoptotic pathway like PI3K/Akt/PTEN axis ( e.g . via PTEN loss function AKT gene amplification ) may lead resistance EGFR inhibitor . Treatment inhibitor mTOR may reverse resistance . Targeting mTOR EGFR pathway concurrently may effectively inhibit tumor growth inhibit either pathway alone . The compelling preclinical data , couple modest single agent activity see EGFR inhibition mTOR inhibition NETs , provide strong rationale study activity concomitant pathway inhibition patient advanced NETs . Support strategy also stem fact EGFR inhibitor safety combine mTOR inhibitor human . Emerging data phase I study RAD001 plus erlotinib patient previously treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) suggest two agent safely combine follow dos : RAD001 5 mg PO q D erlotinib 150 mg PO qD . Of note , original dose selection RAD001 erlotinib study stem directly phase I study combination ( RAD001 5 mg PO qD plus erlotinib 150 mg PO qD ) . The modified dose selection ( RAD001 5 mg PO qD plus erlotinib 100 mg PO qD ) result integrate discussion study sponsor , preliminary safety data first patient enrol study ( suggest patient tolerate full-dose therapy others ) additional phase I data suggest MTD patient population low others , e.g . MTD breast cancer patient RAD001 2.5 mg PO qD erlotinib 100 mg PO QD ( Mayer et al . ASCO 2009 Breast Cancer Symposium , Abstract # 254 ) .</detailed_description>
