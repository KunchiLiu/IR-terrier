	<brief_summary>The investigator would like study role phosphorus metabolism development certain hormonal problem people chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . More specifically , goal research ( 1 ) understand cause hyperparathyroidism - hormone problem often develop patient kidney disease ( 2 ) test whether decrease phosphorus intake could help improve prevent hyperparathyroidism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 ( FGF23 ) Reduction Predialysis Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose proposal ( 1 ) develop pilot data treatment strategy manipulate phosphate load effort ameliorate development secondary hyperparathyroidism increase endogenous calcitriol level , , along decrease phosphate level , may potential survival factor ; ( 2 ) examine effect phosphorus restriction/fibroblast growth factor-23 ( FGF-23 ) reduction strategy insulin resistance cardiac structure function individual renal dysfunction . If proof-of-concept study validates approach , embark large trial extend follow would aim show treatment window phosphate reduction strategy expand million normophosphatemic patient early-stage CKD ultimate goal improve survival . We hypothesize test follow hypothesis : 1 . Decreased dietary phosphorus load chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient normal serum phosphate level , dietary restriction , treatment dietary phosphate binder combination , lead decrease FGF-23 level , increase calcitriol level decrease parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) level . In effort understand magnitude effectiveness intervention accord CKD stage , test hypothesis equal number stage 3a ( estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate eGFR 45 - 60 ml/min ) , stage 3b ( eGFR 30 - 45 ml/min ) stage 4 ( eGFR 15 - 30 ml/min ) CKD patient . This allow u define optimal timing along spectrum CKD intervention effective critical planning future long term outcome study . 2 . Subjects receive phosphorus reduction strategy display increase calcitriol level decrease insulin resistance baseline post-intervention compare subject randomize control arm . The degree improvement modulate receive dietary phosphorus restriction phosphorus binder display great change . 3 . Decreased level FGF-23 , result phosphorus restriction intervention , associate improved cardiac function , particularly measure diastolic function evaluate pre- post-intervention echocardiogram . Overview Study Design - Randomized , double-blinded , placebo control , physiological , crossover study 2 x 2 factorial design CKD patient - Written , inform consent obtain potential subject initial screen visit General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) , undergo brief history physical , baseline blood measurement determine eligibility . - A certified nutritionist evaluate subject ' baseline dietary intake two week run-in period . - Eligible subject provide two 24-hour urine collection separate day prior initiate protocol calculate creatinine clearance estimate mean urinary Pi calcium excretion eat usual diet . - This run-in period follow randomization binder ( Lanthanum Carbonate ) vs. placebo phosphorus restrict vs. unrestricted diet - 25 % subject receive binder + restrict diet ; 25 % binder + unrestricted diet ; 25 % placebo + restrict diet ; 25 % placebo + unrestricted diet ( control group ) - Block randomization ensure 4 intervention group include 10 subject CKD stag 3a , 3b 4 ( 120 total ) - The nutrition intervention manage certified nutritionist - Subjects randomize unrestricted phosphorus diet arm encourage maintain normal eating habit receive specific dietary counseling nutritionist . - Subjects randomize phosphorus restriction arm receive dietary counseling reduce phosphorus intake target 900mg/day . If intake already estimate level , encourage maintain current intake . Subjects low phosphorus intake baseline ( &lt; 900 mg/d ) randomize unrestricted phosphorus diet encourage increase intake . - All subject take pill , either phosphorus binder lanthanum carbonate placebo , ensure subject blinding . - The nutritionist meet subject regardless whether consume reduced phosphate diet normal diet . Since difficult reduce phosphorus intake , subject randomize phosphorus restriction arm aware intervention . However , subject randomize unrestricted phosphorus diet tell randomization . The nutritionist counsel healthy eat habit form `` placebo '' . - Three month follow post randomization , : - Fasting blood urine measure repeat every two week randomization throughout three month intervention . Data study endpoint well safety data ( see ) collect time point . - A certified nutritionist counsel subject randomize phosphorus restrict diet substitute food diet high phosphorus food equivalent nutritional value lower phosphorus use counsel technique employ routine clinical practice . The nutritionist advise subject randomize unrestricted phosphorus diet change eat habit way . - The nutritionist use 3-day food record evaluate intake study subject 3 month intervention . Subjects receive first 3-day food record form screen visit ( visit 1 ) return visit 2 examine study nutritionist preparation counseling . After initial counseling session , subject bring complete 3-day food record GCRC visit 4 , 7 9 . - All subject undergo limited echocardiogram measure physiological change diastolic function pre- post-intervention .</detailed_description>
