	<brief_summary>Respiratory difficulty one primary factor lead death patient Idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease ( IPD ) . The progressive degeneration family segregate motor non-motor circuit brain result motor non-motor dysfunction . Breathing swallow well know affected IPD , attention function fit since patient eventually experience morbidity even mortality result dysfunction . Patients IPD typically become sedentary lose endurance , maximal fitness level overall pulmonary function . Much research focus motor symptom IPD ( tremor , rigidity , bradykinesia ) yet pulmonary complication perhaps ultimately important disability . The inability generate adequate respiratory pressure responsible reduce cough magnitude cough response time . Cough critical clearance foreign material airway help reduce infiltration bacteria subsequent respiratory infection . With reduced cough function increase risk pulmonary disease due reduce ability protect airways occurs . Moreover , recognize debilitate disruption voice speech characteristic limit communication , care taking , employment opportunity social interaction also result poor respiratory function . There number promising outcome expiratory strength-training program . By increase expiratory muscle strength expiratory pressure generation , effective breathing , clearance airway , production louder clearer voice well improve swallowing occur . These explicit outcome predict base experience use innovative device-driven , home-based expiratory strength training program focus expiratory muscle respiration . The aim study : 1 ) Investigate activity expiratory muscle strength training ( EMT ) patient idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( IPD ) , 2 ) Determine effect increase expiratory force generation breathing , cough magnitude , speech production , swallow , 3 ) Determine effect increase expiratory force generation patient 's perception speech change , 4 ) Determine effect Dopamine-replacement therapy ( Parkinson 's medication ) breathing , cough , speaking , swallow measure .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adults age 35 85 year . Diagnosis Idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease ( either tremorpredominant rigid predominant ) neurologist . Disability level II , III , IV ( Hoehn &amp; Yahr , 1976 ) indicate recent neurological evaluation . Forced Expiratory Volumes ( FEV1 ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) within normative range age sex determine pulmonary function screening . Persons able maintain current level physical activity ( include aerobic exercise weightlifting ) throughout entire training period . *Subjects ask report significant change level activity throughout participation study regard intensity frequency exercise ( i.e . sedentary person begin exercise three four day per week ) . Completion inform consent participate study . Other neurological disorder Positive history follow condition : Gastrointestinal disease Gastroesophageal surgery Head neck cancer History breathe disorder disease ( e.g. , Asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ) . Untreated hypertension Heart disease History smoking last five year Failing screen test pulmonary function ( e.g. , FEV1/FVC &lt; 75 % ) Difficulty comply train protocol due neuropsychological dysfunction ( e.g. , severe depression ) . Other illness would prevent patient complete protocol .</criteria>
