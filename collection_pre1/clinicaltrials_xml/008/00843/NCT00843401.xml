	<detailed_description>1.0 BACKGROUND A common method assess respiratory status hospitalize pediatric neonatal patient use pulse oximetry . This noninvasive device us light emit diode ( LED ) emitter , applied area body good local blood flow . Red infrared light shin blood-perfused tissue sensor detect light information send back signal processing unit , monitor , calculation oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) 1 . Typically sensor may place either forehead , finger , neonates - foot , palm toe . Use noninvasive method provide continuous information oxygenation status patient greatly reduce number arterial blood gas puncture sample require patient care . While advantage noninvasive pulse oximetry significant , number factor negatively impact performance device2 . Patient monitoring low saturation episodes one challenge optimal device performance . Improvements sensor technology last 20 year progressively improve accuracy reliability device . Since introduction clinical care 1980 's , number improvement make increase accuracy pulse oximetry oxygen saturation 80 % . Nonetheless , much clinical research pulse oximetry sensor year evaluate device accuracy reliability , limited data available conditions1,6 . The purpose study evaluate accuracy new pulse oximetry sensor specifically design low saturation episode pediatric neonatal patient . Results study provide basic information drive improvement technology . 2.0 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES The general purpose study evaluate feasibility , accuracy performance pediatric neonatal oximetry sensor clinically relevant range arterial saturation 60-100 % . The study objectives follow : 1 . To evaluate accuracy neonatal sensor saturation range 70-80 % follow weight category : 0-5kg . 2 . To evaluate accuracy neonatal pediatric transmission ( digit/foot/hand ) sensor saturation range 60-80 % follow weight category : 0-5kg ; , 5-40kg . 3 . To evaluate accuracy neonatal pediatric transmission ( digit/foot/hand ) sensor saturation range 80-100 % follow weight range : 0-5kg ; , 5-40kg . These objective achieve enrol hospitalize patient several neonatal pediatric unit , include cardiac cath lab , OR intensive care area . Table 1 outline specific data collection . Table 1 60-80 % Saturation Range 80-100 % Saturation Range Neonatal &lt; 5kg . Transmission sensor ( 20 data point target ) Transmission sensor ( 30 data point target ) Pediatric 5-40kg . Transmission sensor ( 20 data point target ) Transmission sensor ( 30 data point target ) *Data require 70-80 % saturation range Data may collect continuously test reference device validate computer data acquisition system and/or Case Report Form ( CRF ) recording , direct comparison measurement take Co-Oximetry ( arterial blood gas ( ABGs ) Co-Oximetry option ) . Arterial blood sampling obtain necessary patient management define attend physician . 3.0 DEFINITION OF TERMS 3.1 Pulse oximetry sensor : Pulse oximetry sensor device , attach skin ( hand , forehead , finger , toe , foot ) without adhesive material connect signal-processing unit purpose noninvasive oxygen saturation monitoring . For purpose study , three different sensor simultaneously place enrolled patient : reference sensor two test sensor ( Nellcor Puritan Bennett LLC , Boulder , CO , Masimo Corporation , Irvine , CA ) . The Masimo sensor rainbow R25 , R25-L , R20 R20-L , Nellcor sensor OxiMax MAX-A , MAX-P , MAX-I MAX-N. All sensor currently available market Masimo sensor compare Nellcor sensor head-to-head test . During study , Masimo sensor connect Masimo bedside pulse oximetry monitor ( Radical-7 ) via standard patient cable , Nellcor sensor connect Nellcor bedside pulse oximetry monitor ( N-600x ) via standard patient cable . 3.2 Sensor accuracy : Sensor accuracy capability test sensor reflect oxygen saturation consistent obtain directly arterial blood sample evaluate Co-Oximetry . 3.3 Skin color : For purpose study , skin color assess Nellcor 's visual inspection rating scale ( i.e. , 1 light , 2 olive hue , 3 dark olive , 4 extremely dark ) . 3.4 Data point : Paired data value Co-Oximetry test sensor . 3.5 Transmission sensor : A sensor emitter photodetector opposite , measure site ( i.e. , digit ) in-between 3.6 Reflectance sensor : A sensor emitter photodetector next top measuring site . 4.0 MATERIALS AND METHODS 4.1 Study Design . This multicenter observational study wherein information collect test device use clinical management . A repeated-measures experimental design use compare test sensor conventional oximetry Co-Oximetry , define `` Gold Standard '' . Both test sensor reference sensor simultaneously apply subject . The reference sensor apply patient 's clinical management , test sensor apply extremity indicate . A minimum 50 subject minimum 100 data point across site necessary address subject-to-subject variability yield statistically significant RMSD . Enrollment study suspend soon minimum achieve . A data point define pair data value Co-Oximetry test sensor . If high variability observe , need subject data-points may determine . 5.0 STUDY PROCEDURE All patient meet eligibility criterion study , sign Informed Consent follow procedure carry : 5.1 The reference sensor apply accord product Directions For Use7 ( DFU ) , test sensor sensor apply recommended site per test sensor 's DFU . 5.2 Demographic ( patient 's physical characteristic ) baseline data collect . 5.3 Skin color . For purpose study , skin color assess Nellcor 's visual inspection rating scale ( i.e. , 1 light , 2 olive hue , 3 dark olive , 4 extremely dark ) . 5.4 The date , time , test sensor track number record CRF . 5.5 Each sensor connect patient cable , connect SpO2 monitor . The monitor connect Nellcor Masimo test sensor use patient care management decision . Alarms test sensors/monitors inactivate prior study use avoid patient management confusion . 5.6 Test sensor data collection discontinue five fifteen minute last anticipated arterial blood draw . The date time sensor discontinuance record CRF . A sample study procedure find Attachment A . A sample Adverse Event Form find Attachment B . 6.0 DATA ANALYSIS Pulse oximetry measurement saturation test device ( sensor ) compare Co-Oximetry measurement arterial oxygen saturation demonstrate test sensor meet oxygen saturation accuracy specification SpO2 use neonatal pediatric population . SpO2 accuracy determine calculate root mean square difference ( RMSD ) test sensor SaO2 CO-oximeter ( ABG ) value follow equation : RMSD = difference SpO2 SaO2 . Paired data value may plot compare Pulse-Oximetry value Co-Oximetry value , across saturation range interest ( i.e. , â‰¤80 % ) . 7.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING All know anticipated adverse event associate study identify Section 8.0 , Risk Analysis . All reportable anticipate , unanticipated , adverse event document Adverse Event Form . 8.0 RISK ANALYSIS The risk participation study primarily physical . Involvement study require addition two additional pulse oximetry sensor extremities subject . There psychological , social , economic , legal risk identify . We believe risk device study procedure non-significant . Physical risk use device may consist principally burn skin . Pulse oximetry sensor attach finger skin surface , use light measure saturation , generate small amount heat . Because low amount current require power LED 's , risk burn minimal . The long history safe performance Nellcor Masimo Pulse Oximetry marketplace evidence risk low . In addition , short duration study make risk extremely unlikely . The application removal oximetry non-invasive tissue sensor present minimal risk subject . There may minor discomfort associate removal adhesive sensor reaction standard adhesive . Injury reaction sensor adhesive rare . 9.0 BENEFITS There direct benefit subject participate study .
