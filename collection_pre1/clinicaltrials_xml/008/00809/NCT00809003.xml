	<brief_summary>This project examine similarity differences ocular surface tear film patient Sjogren 's syndrome relate dry eye , severe dry eye dry eye . This knowledge help clinician understand process create dry eye condition strengthen treatment management strategy use . The subject participate series dry eye test already experience clinic , along gather tear sample surface cell . These tissue analyze distant site .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Inflammatory Functional Changes Ocular Surface Associated With Dry Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry eye multifactorial disease tear ocular surface result symptoms discomfort , visual disturbance tear film instability potential damage ocular surface . It accompany increase osmolarity tear film inflammation ocular surface . A number factor implicate trigger disease , include age , hormone change autoimmune disease . Sjogren 's syndrome ( SS ) common autoimmune disorder , characterize chronic inflammatory infiltration exocrine gland ( particularly salivary lacrimal ) systemic immune reactivity , result dry eye dry mouth . The mechanism inflammation lacrimal gland patient well document . It believe pathological change facilitate secretion inflammatory biochemicals ocular surface . Additionally , SS , also pathological change epithelial cell cornea conjunctiva ( upregulation mRNAs cod inflammatory cytokine ) subsequently contribute increased secretion cytokine . Taken together , change result increase concentration inflammatory mediator tear film , drive propagation dry eye disease process . Severe dry eye ( DE ) patient present similar clinical outcome SS patient , however , inflammatory process associate either initiation propagation dry eye disease well characterize . This research project establish quantify similarity / difference SS severe dry eye participant , respect ocular surface inflammation function . Specifically , study examine dry eye symptom , ocular surface integrity tear film volume flow . Additionally , concentration inflammatory cytokine present tear film quantify .</detailed_description>
