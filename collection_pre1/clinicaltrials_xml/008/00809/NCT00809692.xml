	<brief_summary>A critical first step address `` pharmacodynamic information gap '' pediatrics reside development method capable accurately measure time dependent effect xenobiotic exposure manner sufficient enable integrative analysis drug action incorporate pharmacokinetic pharmacogenetic determinant . The propose study evaluate laser Doppler flowimetry , necessary initial step develop `` ideal '' pharmacodynamic surrogate endpoint ultimately could use infant , child adolescent fully characterize impact development pharmacokinetic ( PK ) / pharmacodynamic ( PD ) / pharmacogenetic ( PG ) determinants drug effect agent capable modulate cellular response histamine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal research develop validate non-invasive approach suitable use pediatrics sufficient directly evaluate genotype-phenotype association determinant concentration-effect profile drug capable alter microvascular function . The specific goal project ass whether microvascular blood flow determine previously validate laser Doppler technique use reliable surrogate endpoint capable functionally discriminate effect polymorphisms gene quantitatively important histamine biotransformation . The investigator hypothesize microvascular blood flow velocity use valid surrogate marker discriminate functional consequence allelic variant enzymes primarily responsible biotransformation histamine . The project include two part : 1 . Validation histamine iontophoresis ( measurement microvascular blood flow laser Doppler flowimetry ) pediatric cohort pharmacologic provocation test capable reliably characterize normal physiologic response cutaneous microvasculature xenobiotic address study 50 child diagnosis allergic disease `` allergic '' condition treatment antihistamines represent medical `` standard care '' . Subjects concomitantly ( contralateral extremity ) receive histamine challenge `` gold standard '' cutaneous prick test ( time dependent response assess serial assessment wheal flare reaction ) previously describe iontophoresis technique ( time dependent response serial assessment microvascular blood flow use validate laser Doppler technique ) .Additionally , DNA isolate subject genotyping described part 2 ) . 2 . Assessment microvascular response histamine challenge surrogate marker capable functionally discriminate genotype-phenotype association polymorphically express gene quantitatively important regulate biotransformation pharmacologic inactivation histamine address first genotyping 150 additional subject establish diagnosis allergic disease treatment antihistamines represent medical `` standard care '' . Genotype data candidate gene primary interest , histamine-N-methyltransferase ( HNMT ) diamine oxidase ( DAO ) , thus available total 200 subject . Based upon know genotype-phenotype association HNMT ( enzyme primarily responsible histamine biotransformation ) , two cohort subject select study use extreme discordant phenotype approach : subject predict , base upon genotype , reduce HMNT activity ( i.e. , 1 0 functional allele ) subject predict normal enzyme activity ( i.e. , two functional allele ) . These study participant receive transcutaneous histamine challenge deliver iontophoresis , follow repeat assessment microvascular reactivity reflect time-averaged measurement blood flow velocity use establish laser Doppler technique . Statistical analysis blood flow velocity parameter laser Doppler assessment use primary outcome measurement comparison two study cohort respect expression HNMT DAO functional consequence thereof , use histamine response surrogate assessment phenotype .</detailed_description>
