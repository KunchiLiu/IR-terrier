	<brief_title>Febrile Urinary Tract Infection Randomized Short Treatment Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In last decades hospitalization rate patient acute pyelonephritis ( AP ) FUTI decrease almost 100 % 10-30 % . The outpatient management patient FUTI become popular well oral antimicrobial treatment regiment shorten treatment duration . However , approach discover otherwise young health non-pregnant woman , best management FUTI elderly , men patient co-morbidity remain elusive . Bases personal perception attend physician antibiotic treatment , duration varies approximately 7-14 day . Facing age general population , urgent good define optimal treatment AP FUTI unselected population identify risk treatment failure poor outcome guide optimize individual patient management prevent one hand unnecessary long treatment duration hospital admission hand unsafe short duration unsafe outpatient management . In study efficacy safety 7-day antimicrobial regimen compare 14-day antimicrobial regimen evaluate unselected population present FUTI primary care emergency department . In addition clinical and/or biomarker base score system disease severity derive predict risk treatment failure poor outcome .</detailed_description>
