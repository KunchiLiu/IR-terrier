	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy effective frequently utilized modality treatment clinically localized prostate cancer . Traditionally , external beam radiation deliver fractionated manner use daily dos 1.8-2.0 Gy . This daily dose derive early animal experiment clinical experience , support mathematical model normal tissue tumor response fraction size . The widely use model linear-quadratic formula , predict response different fraction size base alpha/beta ratio give tissue . One main motivation deliver treatment low dose rate many fraction late-responding normal tissue generally sensitive early-responding tissue ( i.e . tumor ) increase fraction size . So increase number fraction generally spar late-responding tissue tumor . This quantified term alpha/beta ratio : - Small alpha/beta ratio ( 2-4 Gy ) , typical late sequela , mean high sensitivity fractionation change . - Large alpha/beta ratio ( &gt; 8 Gy ) , typical tumor control , mean low sensitivity fractionation change . It generally assume mechanistic basis different fractionation response tumor late-responding normal tissue relate large proportion cycle cell tumor . But prostate tumor contain unusually small fraction cycle cell . Brenner Hall well Duchesne Peters reason prostate tumor might respond change fractionation way cancer ; paper hypothesize prostate tumor might respond change fractionation dose rate like late-responding normal tissue . , In mathematical term , suggestion alpha/beta ratio prostate cancer might low , comparable late-responding tissue even low . Previous estimate alpha/beta ratio normal tissue tumor tissue generally 3 10 , respectively . Recent evidence estimate alpha/beta ratio prostate cancer low 1.5 . If hypothesis true , optimal therapeutic ratio prostate cancer would achieve use daily dos higher 2 Gy . Several preliminary clinical report find reasonable PSA control rate increase late toxicity use dos 2.5 3 Gy . Kupelian Mayo Clinic find PSA-free survival rate 97 % , 88 % , 70 % low- , intermediate- , high-risk patient , respectively . The dose regimen use 70 Gy 2.5 Gy daily fraction . Both acute late toxicity high see typical dose regimen . A group Christie Hospital report 82 % , 56 % , 39 % 5-year biochemical disease free survival rate ( low , intermediate , high risk , respectively ) patient treat 50 Gy 16 fraction ( 3.125 Gy per fraction ) , acceptable bowel bladder toxicity . These result , although promising , require validation . If hypothesis prostate cancer alpha/beta ratio low normal tissue correct , optimal fractional dose likely even high dos test thus far , incorrect , result may increase normal tissue toxicity .</detailed_description>
