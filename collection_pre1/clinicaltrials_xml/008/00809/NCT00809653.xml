	<brief_summary>Air pollution major cause cardiorespiratory morbidity mortality . The exact component air pollution underlie cardiovascular effect yet know , combustion-derived particulate matter suspect major cause . Epidemiological study show exposure air pollution cause exacerbation exist cardiorespiratory condition lead increased hospital admission death . The investigator recently conduct series control exposure study urban particulate matter diesel exhaust healthy volunteer patient coronary heart disease . The investigator find controlled exposure dilute diesel exhaust patient prior myocardial infarction induce asymptomatic myocardial ischaemia increase electrocardiographic measure myocardial ischaemia . Whilst important , question remain : ( ) air pollution exposure exacerbate ischaemia reduce exercise tolerance patient symptomatic angina pectoris , ( ii ) `` real world '' exposure encounter urban environment major city similar effect , ( iii ) simple face mask intervention reduce exposure particulate air pollution improve health outcome patient coronary heart disease ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Pro-ischaemic Effects Air Pollution Exposure Using Simple Face Mask</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>100 patient stable angina pectoris recruit HPS-THRIVE cohort cardiology outpatient department Fuwai Hospital Beijing . Patients attend department first thing morning two occasion , separate least 1 week . All subject fit 12-lead Holter monitor 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor . They issue diary record activity symptom . Patients randomise wear simple facemask one visit ( 3M Dust Respirator 8812 ) . When randomised wear mask , subject ask wear mask much possible 24 hour prior study day 24 hour study day ( 48 hour total ) . Subjects instruct wear mask time outdoors , much possible indoors . On visit , patient ask walk along prespecified route 2 hour city centre location Beijing . During period patient walk pace 15 min rest 5 min total 120 min ( 6 cycle ) . After walk , subject return department pollution equipment switch . A formal BRUCE protocol exercise stress test perform soon possible finish 2-hour walk , blood test take prior exercise stress test ( 10-20mls total ) . Subjects ask wear ambulatory blood pressure monitor Holter ECG monitor total 24 hour , return follow day remove . Personal exposure air pollution determine 2 hour walk series monitor contain within small backpack .</detailed_description>
