	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine GM-K562/leukemia cell vaccine safely give soon allogeneic marrow blood stem cell transplant . The GM-K562/leukemia cell vaccine compose culture cell line genetically modify secrete GM-CSF , naturally occur substance body stimulate immune system . The vaccine mixture GM-K562 cell ( radiate prevent grow participant body ) participant 's previously freeze kill leukemia cell . By mix GM-K562 leukemia cell , would like study whether vaccine combination stimulate participant 's new immune system recognize fight MDS/AML cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination With GM-K562 Cells Patients With Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) After Allogeneic Hematopoetic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants give GM-K562/Leukemia call vaccine injection skin total six time . The first 3 vaccine give weekly vaccine 4 6 give every week . Therefore , expect vaccine complete period 9 week . - During 9 week vaccination period , participant physical exam monitor side effect graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Bone marrow biopsy perform time enrollment study , 4 week completion 6 GM-K562/Leukemia cell vaccine , 1 year participant transplant . - As way test whether GM-K562/Leukemia cell vaccine trigger immune response participant leukemia , inject small amount leukemia cell ( kill radiation ) participant skin see body generate reaction leukemia cell . This test call leukemia cell delay hypersensitivity test ( DTH ) . This test perform three time study , week 1st vaccine , 5th vaccine 4 week 6th vaccine . - There total 5 skin biopsy require part study . Biopsies take vaccination sit 2-3 day first fifth vaccine . Similar biopsy take DTH sit 1st vaccination , 5th vaccination 4-6 week 6th vaccination .</detailed_description>
