	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) common cause cancer mortality men woman Singapore.Chemotherapy biologically target agent extend survival modestly patient ; therefore , discovery novel way prolong disease course top research priority . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal pathway play central role neoplastic transformation NSCLC promote cancer cell survival , metastasis , angiogenesis . The predominance EGFR signal NSCLC make pathway attractive candidate development target therapeutic . Over last three year , FDA approve two drug salvage treatment NSCLC , gefitinib ( Iressa 速 , formerly know ZD1839 ) erlotinib ( Tarceva 速 , formerly know OSI-774 ) . Both small molecule orally-bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) EGFR TK domain , show improve survival compare placebo asian patient administered failure first second line chemotherapy advance NSCLC . Recently , find somatic mutation EGFR gene sensitize NSCLC tumor TKIs . These mutation present approximately 50 % asian patient NSCLC . Retrospective study suggest patient harbor mutation may derive great clinical benefit treatment TKIs patient without mutation . Nevertheless , patient benefit TKI treatment ultimately develop resistance therapy manifest progression cancer , remain , treatment option . Hence , would vast clinical utility understand mechanism TKI resistance develop strategy reverse prevent . We preliminary data show combination hydroxychloroquine gefitinib result delay acquire resistance gefitinib cell line harbour EGFR mutation . In addition , addition hydroxychloroquine gefitinib result reversal acquire resistance gefitinib . Much parallel observe resistance mechanism NSCLC cell line molecular change observe patient thus far . The long term aim therefore examine efficacy combination delay acquire resistance gefitinib NSCLC patient . First , however , MTD DLT drug use combination therapy examine study . The aim examine pharmacokinetic effect interaction hydroxychloroquine gefitinib , vice versa . Gefitinib usually well tolerate , main toxicity rash diarrhoea . Hydroxychloroquine also FDA approve widely use generally well-tolerated rheumatological condition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For lead phase I study : 1 . Pathologically confirm diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer . 2 . Stage IIIB pleural effusion stage IV disease American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) 6th edition stag criterion . 3 . Age equal great 21 year 4 . Measurable disease , define accord RECIST criterion 5 . Performance status 0 , 1 , 2 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status scale . 6 . At least 2 week since prior radiation treatment , chemotherapy target therapy ( day protocol treatment begin ) . Patients gefitinib wash period two week prior commencement treatment drug study . 7 . Adequate organ function include follow : Adequate bone marrow reserve : Total white blood cell count ( WBC ) &gt; 3.0 x 109/L Platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL Hepatic : Bilirubin : = 1.25 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) : = &lt; 5 time ULN Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) : = &lt; 5 time ULN Renal : Serum creatinine = &lt; 1.5 time ULN , creatinine clearance = &gt; 60mL/minute calculated standard Cockcroft Gault formula . 8 . Approval HCQ treatment eye doctor , base screen eye exam . Examples disqualify baseline condition include macular degeneration retinal disease , see exclusion criterion . 9 . Willingness comply protocol procedure include bloodsampling schedule PK analyse periodic eye examination . 10 . Willingness participate clinical research evidence signature inform consent form . 11 . Tumor block subject 's biopsy surgical resection specimen ideally available mandatory requirement study entry . For phase II study : Inclusion criterion , except : 1 . NSCLC patient must nonsmoker adenocarcinomas . 2 . Patients gefitinib wash period two week prior commencement treatment drug study . They must respond Gefitinib previously ( either CR , PR SD ) twelve week eligible . For lead phase I phase II study : 1 . Current use hydroxychloroquine reason . 2 . Known hypersensitivity chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine , closely related drug . 3 . Known hypersensitivity erlotinib , gefitinib , closely related drug . 4 . Glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency , HCQ may cause hemolytic anemia patient G6PD deficiency . 5 . Cataracts would interfere require funduscopic examination , severe baseline visual impairment include macular degeneration , retinopathy visual field change , one functional eye . All patient must undergo screen eye exam prior enrollment . 6 . Pregnant breastfeeding . HCQ cross placenta use recommend pregnancy except lifethreatening malaria . The effect gefitinib fetus unknown . For reason , female subject childbearing age must practice acceptable method birth control avoid pregnancy . Male subject must also practice acceptable method birth control prevent pregnancy partner . 7 . Symptomatic CNS metastases newly diagnose CNS metastases yet definitively treat radiation and/or surgery . Note patient history CNS metastases cord compression allowable definitively treat clinically stable . Maintenance steroid allow maintenance seizure medication allow . 8 . Prior radiation therapy inclusive identify target lesion . Note prior palliative radiation bony disease , CNS disease , limited thoracic area allow , provide measurable disease outside field radiation complete least two week prior start treatment patient fully recovered side effect . 9 . Any evidence clinically active interstitial lung disease . Note patient chronic , stable radiographic change asymptomatic need exclude . 10 . Malignancies within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . 11 . Although absolute exclusion criterion , caution exercise patient diagnosis prophyria nonlightsensitive psoriasis , HCQ significantly exacerbate condition . 12 . Evidence significant clinical disorder laboratory find make undesirable patient participate study , opinion investigator . 13 . Use nonFDA approve investigational agent within 2 week enrol onto trial , failure recover side effect agent . 14 . Penicillamine use Wilson 's disease indication , concomitant use HCQ increase toxicity penicillamine . 15 . Concommitant use anticonvulsant allow .</criteria>
