	<brief_summary>Over last 30 year survival rate baby bear prematurely improve greatly research . As baby grow , find many premature baby learn movement problem . The purpose research learn premature infant risk learn disability movement problem later childhood whether change caffeine therapy . Caffeine often use premature baby help breathe . Nearly baby bear 30 week gestation receive caffeine neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . Scientists show caffeine therapy give premature baby reduce disability . We use brain monitoring , include electro-encephalogram ( EEG ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) understand brain premature baby develop whether caffeine high dos enhances protection develop brain . Just monitor heart lungs improve care premature baby , wish monitor brain understand improve care brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Apnea define cessation breathe twenty second great , brief episode associate bradycardia , cyanosis , pallor . Recurrent apnea prematurity occur 85 % infant born 1000g . Standard treatment care apnea prematurity administration methylxanthines , specifically caffeine citrate , respiratory stimulant . This class pharmacotherapy nonselective inhibitor adenosine receptor . Adenosine inhibit respiratory neural output directly interactions another inhibitor respiratory control , GABA . Adenosine A1 receptor also think play role hypoxia-induced brain injury , feature perinatal white matter injury observe rodent treat A1AR agonists early postnatal life . By inhibit adenosine effect , caffeine may play role prevent white matter injury . Recently , caffeine therapy apnea prematurity show improve rate survival without neurodevelopmental disability 18 21 month , reduce incidence cerebral palsy , reduce incidence cognitive delay infant low birth weight . In last five year , multiple trial study effect use high dos caffeine citrate treatment apnea prematurity . Steer compare efficacy three dose regimen caffeine citrate ( 3 , 15 , 30 mg/kg ) find high dos caffeine correlate less documented apnea less time oxygen saturation &lt; 85 % . The effectiveness high caffeine dos confirm Scanlon show load dose 50 mg/kg caffeine citrate effective reduce apneic episode within eight hour caffeine citrate load dose 25 mg/kg . Studies evaluate long-term neurologic effect higher dos methylxanthines , however , result conflict conclusion . For patient 12 month correct gestational age , Steer find high incidence major disability low dose caffeine group compare high-dose group ( 18 % 7.5 % ) . Conversely , Davis report high incidence cerebral palsy 14 year old child birth weight 1501g treated theophylline newborn period prematurely born infant without methylxanthine treatment ( 13 % 1.6 % ) . Recent advance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) allow new technique visualize brain injury development preterm infant non-invasive mean . Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) modality MRI measure translational motion water within tissue , `` apparent diffusion . '' If direction diffusion hinder one direction another , water motion consider anisotropic . Water apparent diffusion mature white matter highly anisotropic ; directionally average water apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) reference 1.0-2.0 x 10^-3 mm2/s infant brain , 0.8 x 10^-3 mm2/s adult brain . Normative value obtain DTI show sensitive indicator white gray matter development complexity . Both Dyet Woodward able correlate abnormal white matter signal brain MRI preterm infant subsequent impairment cognitive , motor , neurosensory outcomes . As caffeine use CAPT study demonstrate low dos commence around 3 day life positive impact neurodevelopmental outcomes 18 21 month , would beneficial understand effect higher dose caffeine short- long-term outcome emphasis prevention brain injury ( intraventricular hemorrhage white matter injury ) improvement neurodevelopmental development . Thus , propose randomize controlled trial high-dose versus standard low-dose caffeine therapy postulate high dos caffeine citrate beneficial effect short- long-term neurologic outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Preterm infants 24 30 week complete PMA admit neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) St. Louis Children 's Hospital . The estimated post menstrual age provide obstetrical record compare Dubowitz exam admission . The provided PMA use unless Dubowitz exam discrepancy great equal 2 week , Dubowitz age use . Infants must recruit within first 24 hour life . Infants 30 week gestation . Infants moribund severe sepsis , respiratory failure , severe brain injury present first 24 hour life . This would define physiologic instability require &gt; 80 % FiO2 6 hour and/or 2 inotropic drug ( exclude hydrocortisone ) , attend recruit physician ' opinion infant likely die within 24 hour would tolerate handle protocol . Infants must receive dos caffeine citrate prior enrollment .</criteria>
