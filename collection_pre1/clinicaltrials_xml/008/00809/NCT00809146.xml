	<brief_title>Paramedic Treatment Prolonged Seizures Intramuscular Versus Intravenous Anticonvulsant Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seizures common medical problem . Although frightening watch , seizures brief stop . Seizures n't stop second minute dangerous life-threatening medical emergency . Paramedics often medication stop seizure , best way give medicine know . Paramedics often give medicine directly vein , call intravenous ( IV ) administration . This work well , hard person seize . It also take time delay treatment . Another way give medicine shot give muscle , call intramuscular ( IM ) administration . Giving medicine way faster , may stop seizure quickly . This clinical trial , Rapid Anti-convulsant Medication Prior ARrival Trial ( RAMPART ) , design figure whether give anti-seizure medicine work similarly well quickly give IV give shot muscle . Two similar medicine use . Both already use paramedic field doctor hospital stop seizure . One commonly give IV , commonly give shot muscle . In study , shot give use device similar EpiPenâ€”which autoinjector use people severe allergy . Approximately 1,024 person whose seizure continue emergency medical service ( EMS ) arrival meet eligibility criterion enrol trial . Every participant treat anti-seizure medicine paramedic . At random , half participant one group half another . Half participant receive study medicine IV give shot muscle without medicine ( placebo ) . The half receive medicine shot muscle plus IV without medicine ( placebo ) . In September 2010 , rapid expect enrollment make feasible increase sample size study 800 1,024 already available funding . The goal expansion enroll pediatric subject ( since trial enrol slightly few anticipate ) improve power study 90 % , initially desire . It important understand extend enrollment sample size re-estimation way . The opportunity extend trial pragmatic , base solely early enrollment success trial . It inform plan interim analysis perform , result remain sequestered , unscheduled interim analysis . The firewall prevents blind leadership knowledge outcome data diligently maintain throughout process propose implement extension .</detailed_description>
