	<brief_summary>The purpose study find vitamin E help treat prostate cancer . Vitamin E act primarily anti-oxidant . By decrease oxidation cancer cell , tumor cell may die . Vitamin E commonly use vitamin approve Food Drug Administration use type cancer know cancer . This study test hypothesis vitamin E , set oxidative stress smoking , reduce prostate cancer related biomarkers patient localized prostate cancer neoadjuvant setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Study Neoadjuvant Vitamin E Patients With Locally Treatable Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer common malignancy American men . It estimate nearly 235,000 men United States would diagnose prostate cancer nearly 27,000 men would die . The treatment localized prostate cancer include surgery , radiation therapy , watchful wait . The relative benefit approach unclear treatment choice individualize often patient driven . There currently prove benefit receive preoperative hormonal therapy patient undergoing radical prostatectomy . As opposed patient undergoing external beam radiation therapy , patient undergo brachytherapy pre treatment hormonal therapy use approximately 40 % patient . Thus , patient offer unique opportunity test novel agent neoadjuvant setting . - Vitamin E The term vitamin E introduce Evans Bishop describe dietary factor important reproduction rat . Natural vitamin E include two group closely related fat-soluble compound , tocopherol tocotrienols . Eight analogous compound widely distribute nature . Rich , natural source vitamin E edible plant oil . Distinct biological effect different form vitamin E distinguish molecular level . Vitamin E major hydrophobic chain-breaking antioxidant prevents propagation free radical reaction lipid component membrane , vacuole plasma lipoprotein . As antioxidant , vitamin E act cell membrane prevents propagation free radical reaction . Non-radical oxidation product form reaction alpha-tocopheryl radical free radical , conjugate glucuronic acid excrete bile urine . Vitamin E transport plasma lipoprotein . Most study safety vitamin E supplementation last several month less , little evidence long-term safety vitamin E supplementation . The Food Nutrition Board Institute Medicine set upper tolerable intake level ( UL ) vitamin E 1,000 mg ( 1,500 IU ) form supplementary alpha-tocopherol per day . Based part result animal study , Food Nutrition Board decide vitamin E act anticoagulant may increase risk bleed problem high dose unlikely result bleed problem ( http : //dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamin.asp ) . The dose vitamin E use Selenium vitamin E prostate cancer prevention trial ( SELECT trial ) 400 IU per day thus dose choose study .</detailed_description>
