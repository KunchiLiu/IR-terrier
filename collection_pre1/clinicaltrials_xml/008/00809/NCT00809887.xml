	<brief_title>Micafungin Lock Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The antimicrobial lock therapy ( ALT ) consist fill catheter lumen supraphysiologic concentration ( 100- 1000- fold high ) antimicrobial agent allow dwell ( lock ) several hour attempt sterilize lumen . Advantages ALT : ability administer high local concentration ; ease administration ; cost-savings vein access-savings decrease number surgical procedure operate room catheter replacement ; decrease possible surgical complication risk . The Infectious Diseases Society America , Society Healthcare Epidemiology America others recommend ALT treatment uncomplicated bacteremia . This technique however currently recommend treatment catheter-related fungal infection , primarily due lack adequate data . This study plan enroll approximately 20 child admit Children 's Medical Center Dallas high need central venous catheter evidence fungemia study investigate effectiveness ALT Micafungin fungal infection .</detailed_description>
