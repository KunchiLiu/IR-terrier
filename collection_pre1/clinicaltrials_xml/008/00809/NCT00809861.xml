	<brief_summary>Aim : Osteosynthesis lock plate/screws become increasingly popular recent year . It treatment option allow immediate postoperative immobilization . However , compare conservative treatment treatment external fixators , lock plate expensive operation challenging , even experience surgeon . The long-term result treatment modality equal , show numerous study . However , evidence base study publish yet look short-term outcome . The investigator feel know patient need postoperative immobilization return work significantly earlier independent faster patient whose wrist immobilize 6 week . If case , high cost risk operation justify , , re-evaluate indication use lock distal radius plate distal radius Methods : Group 1 : Treatment distal radius fracture either volar dorsal lock plate . No fixation postoperatively , immediate ROM ( range motion ) exercise usage wrist activity daily life ( ADL ) allow . Radiological clinical control 2 week , 6 week 12 week postoperatively . Endpoints time return work / return independency ( old people ) , ROM ; Grip strength ( Jamar Dynamometer ) . Outcome score DASH ( Disability Arm , Shoulder Hand Score ) PRWE ( Patient relate wrist evaluation ) . Group 2 Treatment distal radius fracture either external fixator +/- K-wires K-wires forearm cast cast alone . Main issue wrist immobilized period 6 week . Radiological clinical control 2 week , 6 week 12 week postoperatively . Endpoints time return work / return independency ( old people ) , ROM ; Grip strength ( Jamar Dynamometer ) . Outcome score DASH PRWE . Both plat external fixation / cast fixation standard accept treatment modality distal radius fracture . A power analysis indicate total sample size 52 patient randomize equally ( 1:1 ) treatment arm without block stratification would provide 80 % statistical power ( alpha = .05 , beta = .20 ) detect 20 % difference mean DASH PRWE score .</brief_summary>
